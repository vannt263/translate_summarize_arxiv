    "with the increase in both wireless channel bandwidth and the computational capability of wireless devices , wireless networks now can be used to support time critical applications such as video streaming or interactive gaming .",
    "such time critical applications require the data content to reach the destination node(s ) in a timely fashion , i.e. , a delay deadline is imposed on packet reception , beyond which the reception becomes useless ( or invalid ) @xcite .",
    "recently , network coding becomes a promising approach to improve wireless network performance @xcite .",
    "specifically , the work in @xcite proposed the first network coding based packet forwarding architecture , named _",
    "cope _ , to improve the throughput of wireless networks . with cope",
    ", each node opportunistically overhears some of the packets transmitted by its neighbors , which are not intended to itself .",
    "the relay node can then intelligently xor multiple packets and forward it to multiple next hops with only one transmission , which results in a significant throughput improvement .    in most recent works for wireless network coding",
    ", network nodes always transmit packets at a fixed rate",
    ". however , most wireless systems are now capable of performing adaptive modulation to vary the link transmission rate in response to the signal to interference plus noise at the receivers .",
    "transmission rate diversity exhibits a rate - range tradeoff : the higher the transmission rate , the shorter the transmission range for a given transmission power @xcite . to aid overhearing",
    ", one may use the lowest transmission rate , so as to successfully deliver packet to more receivers / overhearing nodes .",
    "although this may increase the coding opportunity , it may not yield good performance , especially for time critical applications , as the arrival times of packets may be delayed .    in the literature ,",
    "only a few works studied the relationships between adapting the transmission rate and the network coding gain @xcite .",
    "the work in @xcite showed that compared with pure network coding scheme , joint rate adaptation and network coding is more effective in throughput performance .",
    "they also proposed a joint rate selection and coding scheme to minimize the sum of the uplink and the downlink costs in star network topology .",
    "the work in @xcite mathematically formulated the optimal packet coding and rate selection problem as an integer programming problem , and proposed an efficient heuristic algorithm to jointly find a good combination of coding solution and the transmission rate .",
    "however , there are only a few works considered the delay guarantee of packet receptions , which is especially important for time critical applications .",
    "so far , only @xcite considered the delay constraint of packet reception , and proposed a coding scheme to minimize the number of packets that miss their deadlines .",
    "however , they assume that the transmission rates on all the links are fixed and the same .    in this paper , by considering the impact of both transmission rate and network coding on the packet reception delay , we design a joint rate selection and network coding ( rsnc ) scheme for wireless time critical applications , so as to minimize the total number of packets that will miss their deadlines at the destination nodes .",
    "the main contributions of our paper can be concluded as follows .    * we propose a novel graph model , which considers both the heterogenous transmission rates and the deadlines of the packet receptions during the graph construction . based on the graph model",
    ", we mathematically formulate the problem of minimizing the total number of packets that miss their deadlines by joint rate selection and network coding , as an integer programming problem . *",
    "we propose a metric to determine the coded packet and the transmission rate for each packet transmission . by considering the impact of the transmission rate on both delay and network coding gain",
    ", we also design an efficient algorithm to optimize the proposed metric .",
    "* we compare the performance of the proposed rsnc scheme with some existing algorithms .",
    "simulation results show that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the packet deadline miss ratio .",

    "in this section , we first illustrate the motivation of our problem . we then give the problem description and its complexity .",
    "we now give an example to show how joint rate selection and network coding affect the time critical applications .",

    "[ fig.rsnc ] as an example , where source / transmitting node node @xmath0 needs to transmit packet @xmath1 to node @xmath2 respectively .",
    "[ fig.rsnc](a ) gives the set of overheard packets @xmath3 at destination @xmath4 .",

    "however , there is a problem for selecting the transmission rate at @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath9 is selected , @xmath10 can not successfully receive the packet , as the maximum transmission rates from @xmath0 to them are both @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath7 is selected , although all of the three receivers @xmath2 can receive and decode one  wanted \" packet , @xmath11 will miss its deadline at @xmath12 , as its arrival time is @xmath13 .    as an alternative",

    ", we consider the application of network coding in wireless networks .",
    "each network node knows the overheard / routed packets that its neighbors have such that it can perform network coding operations .",
    "such information can be achieved by using _",
    "reception reports _ , as introduced in @xcite .",
    "we also assume that the forwarding / relaying node knows the deadlines of the packet receptions at its receivers . specifically , we consider the transmission scheme within a single hop since multi hop can be regarded as multiple single hops . as in cope",
    "@xcite , only xors coding is performed at the node in our work .    without loss of generality ,",
    "let @xmath0 be the current source node , and @xmath19 be the set of packets required to be transmitted from @xmath0 .",
    "suppose that @xmath20 is the set of @xmath0 s neighbors which requires packets in @xmath21 sent from node @xmath0 .",

    "let @xmath26 be the reception deadline of packet @xmath27 at node @xmath23 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath28 is the maximum transmission rate on link @xmath29 , and only if the transmission rate from @xmath0 to @xmath23 is less than @xmath28 , the packet sent from @xmath0 can be successfully received by @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "we also assume that the size of each packet is @xmath30 .",
    "our problem is that given the set of overheard packets at each node @xmath23 , @xmath3 , the set of packets required by @xmath23 , @xmath22 , the deadline of required packet @xmath27 at node @xmath23 , @xmath26 , and the maximum transmission rate @xmath28 on the link from @xmath0 to @xmath23 , design the encoding strategy of the packets and select the transmission rate for each propagation , such that the total number of packets that miss their deadlines at each destination is minimized .",
    "let @xmath31 be @xmath32 if packet @xmath27 misses its deadline at @xmath23 , otherwise , let it be @xmath33 , where @xmath25 .",
    "thus , our objective is to minimize @xmath34 in this paper , we refer such a problem of joint rate selection and network coding ( rsnc ) for time critical applications as rsnc problem .",
    "the rsnc problem is np - hard .",
    "we can consider a special case of the rsnc problem : @xmath35 and the maximum transmission rates on all the links are the same . then",
    ", this special case is equivalent to finding a maximum weight clique problem as in @xcite , which is known as an np - hard problem .",
    "thus , the rsnc problem is also np - hard .",
    "although the graph model in @xcite works well for the case where the transmission rates on all the links are the same and fixed , it can not be used directly for our rsnc problem . here",
    ", we construct a novel graph model @xmath36 , which considers both the transmission rates and the packet reception deadlines .",
    "we define @xmath37 as the minimum transmission rate that can be used to meet the deadline of @xmath25 at @xmath23 .",
    "we add a vertex @xmath38 in @xmath39 , only if the following two conditions can be met .",
    "\\(1 ) @xmath25 ;    \\(2 ) @xmath40 .    note that , if @xmath41 , packet @xmath27 will definitely miss its deadline at @xmath23 .",

    "that is , @xmath43 .",
    "then , for any two different vertices @xmath44 , there is a link @xmath45 if all the following conditions can be satisfied .",

    "next , we will use an example to show the novelty of our graph model as compared to others in the literature , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "still take fig .",
    "[ fig.rsnc ] as an example .",
    "the graph constructed by @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.example ] ( a ) . according to @xcite ,",
    "any clique in the graph represents a feasible encoded packet .",
    "thus , @xmath8 can be sent and its intended next hops are @xmath2 , because @xmath59,@xmath60,@xmath61 forms a clique . as described in sec .",
    "[ sec.formulation.motivation ] , it is not a good choice .",
    "however , with our graph model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.example](b ) , @xmath62 will not be encoded as vertices @xmath63,@xmath60,@xmath64 do not form a clique in the graph .",
    "in addition , for the current transmission , the encoded packet derived from any clique in the graph can be sent without missing the deadlines at its intended destinations .",
    "for example , if @xmath15 , which is derived from the clique @xmath65 , is sent with the minimum of the maximum transmission rates among @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath7 , its intended next hops @xmath10 can successfully decode the packets @xmath68 respectively , without missing their deadlines .",
    "[ fig.example ]    with the graph @xmath36 , we have the following lemma .",
    "[ lemma_graph ] for the current packet transmission , if the encode packet @xmath56 , where @xmath69 , is sent with the transmission rate @xmath70 , it will be received by all the nodes in @xmath71 . in addition , for each @xmath58 , the packet @xmath27 will be decoded by @xmath23 without missing its deadline .",
    "firstly , we can easily obtain that with transmission rate @xmath70 , all the receivers in @xmath71 can successfully receive the sending packet .",
    "this is because the transmission rate @xmath72 must be lower than the maximum transmission rate from @xmath0 to @xmath55 .",
    "secondly , our graph is the subgraph of that constructed in  @xcite . according to @xcite ,",
    "if @xmath73 is successfully received by @xmath74 , @xmath23 can decode its  wanted \" packet @xmath27 , where @xmath58 .",
    "thus , any receiver @xmath55 can obtain a  wanted \" packet @xmath27 from @xmath75 with transmission rate @xmath72 , where @xmath58 .",
    "thirdly , according to the condition ( c ) , we have @xmath76 so , its arrival time at receiver @xmath23 is @xmath77 in other words , the arrival time of the packet @xmath78 will not miss its deadline at its receiver @xmath55 , where @xmath58 .    as in lemma",
    "[ lemma_graph ] , a clique @xmath79 in the graph represents a feasible transmission solution for the current propagation , with the encoded packet @xmath75 , transmission rate @xmath70 , intended next hops in @xmath71 , and the propagation delay @xmath80 .",
    "while lemma  [ lemma_graph ] ensures that any encoding strategy based on any clique in the graph will be delivered within deadline for the current packet transmission , the transmission orders of the encoded packets , represented by the cliques in @xmath36 , also affects the timely packet receptions at their destinations .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.example](b ) , if we first schedule packet @xmath11 with transmission rate @xmath9 , represented by clique @xmath81 , and then schedule packet @xmath15 with transmission rate @xmath7 , represented by clique @xmath65 , all the packets will be received at their destinations without missing deadlines . however ,",
    "if we first schedule packet @xmath15 , and then packet @xmath11 , packet @xmath11 will miss its deadline at @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the next task for us is to find a set of cliques in the graph and schedule the transmissions of the encoded packets represented by each clique , so as to minimize the number of missed packets for the whole transmission process .",
    "suppose that @xmath82 is a clique in the graph , and the encoded packet represented by it is sent as the @xmath83-th transmission at node @xmath0 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the @xmath83-th transmission at @xmath0 is @xmath86 where @xmath87 , and the transmission rate is @xmath88 .",
    "let @xmath89 be the transmission delay of the @xmath83-th transmission .",
    "we firstly define the following variant .",
    "@xmath90 then , we can formulate the rsnc problem based on the graph model as follows .",
    "@xmath91 subject to@xmath92 where @xmath93 is a sufficient large constant .    in the above formulation , the term of the objective represents the number of packets that miss their deadlines at the receivers , which needs to be minimized . constraint  ( [ ch.1 ] ) denotes that each vertex in the graph can only belong to one clique .",
    "constraint  ( [ ch.2 ] ) means that if there is no link between vertex @xmath38 and @xmath94 , vertices @xmath95 can not be in the same clique .",
    "constraint  ( [ ch.3 ] ) gives the transmission delay for the @xmath83-th transmission , which is equal to the transmission delay with the minimum transmission rate among the rates from @xmath0 to all intended receivers .",
    "the sufficient large constant @xmath93 is used to guarantee that if @xmath96 , @xmath31 must be @xmath32 , as denoted in constraint  [ ch.4 ] , and if @xmath97 , @xmath31 must be @xmath33 , as denoted in constraint  [ ch.5 ] . note that the arrival time of the packet in the @xmath83-th transmission should consist of both the waiting time of the previous @xmath98 transmissions and the transmission time of the @xmath83-th transmission , i.e. , @xmath99 .",
    "thus , constraint  ( [ ch.4 ] ) and  ( [ ch.5 ] ) show that only if the arrival time of @xmath27 at @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath100 , is no more than the reception deadline of @xmath27 at @xmath23 , @xmath31 can be @xmath33 .    with the above integer nonlinear programming , we can get the optimal solution of rsnc problem . however , the computational complexity for the above integer nonlinear programming is too high when the graph is large .",
    "thus , we need to find an efficient algorithm to solve it .",
    "since each clique in the graph represents a feasible transmission strategy for the current transmission , instead of determining the whole transmission sequence at once , we first design the algorithm to determine the encoding strategy and rate selection scheme for each packet propagation , by selecting a clique at a time . the whole transmission process",
    "consists of multiple packets transmission / cliques selection .",
    "first of all , in order to measure the  goodness \" of transmitting an encoded packet at a specific transmission rate for each packet propagation , it is necessary for us to adopt a reasonable metric which should take into account the impact of the transmission rate and the packet reception deadlines . in this section , we shall design a metric , which not only satisfies as more requests as possible , but also minimizes the number of packets missing the deadlines after the current transmission .",
    "for the current transmission , given an encoded packet and a selected transmission rate , let @xmath101 be @xmath32 if @xmath27 is decoded / received by @xmath23 from the current propagation without missing its deadline , otherwise , let it be @xmath33 .",
    "in addition , as described in fig .",
    "[ fig.rsnc ] , the current encoding strategy and transmission rate also affect the timely receptions of the packets in the following propagations .",
    "let @xmath102 be 1 if @xmath27 will definitely miss its deadline at @xmath23 after the current propagation , otherwise , let it be @xmath33 .",
    "later , we will introduce how to calculate @xmath101 and @xmath102 for a given encoded packet and transmission rate .",
    "let @xmath72 be the transmission rate selected for the current propagation .",
    "our metric can be defined as follows .    for a coding solution @xmath103 , define the metric @xmath104 when using the transmission rate @xmath72 as follows : where @xmath105 is the parameter , which can be defined as the benefit ( e.g. , importance ) of the packet @xmath27 .",
    "firstly , for a given encoded packet @xmath103 , @xmath101 is @xmath32 only if all the following conditions are met : 1 ) @xmath106 , which means @xmath23 can successfully receive the sending packet ; 2 ) @xmath25 , which means @xmath27 is required at @xmath23 ; 3 ) all the other packets combined in the encoded packet except @xmath27 are available at @xmath23 , which denotes the decoding requirement of @xmath27 at @xmath23 ; 4 ) @xmath107 , which shows the requirement of the reception deadline .",
    "secondly , for each packet @xmath25 which is not successfully received / decoded by @xmath23 from the current transmission without missing deadlines ( @xmath108 ) , @xmath102 is @xmath32 only if @xmath109 here , @xmath80 is the transmission delay of the current transmission , and @xmath110 denotes the minimum delay to meet @xmath27 s deadline at @xmath23 in the next transmission . if the sum of the current transmission delay and the next minimum transmission delay is larger than the deadline of @xmath27 at @xmath23 , @xmath27 will definitely miss its deadline , i.e. , @xmath111 .",
    "thus , given an encoded packet and its transmission rate , @xmath101 and @xmath102 are both determined .",
    "hence the meaning of metric @xmath104 in ( [ equation.u ] ) can be explained as follows . the first term @xmath112 denotes the benefit obtained from the packets that are received without missing their deadlines from the current transmission . the second term @xmath113 represents the lost due to packets that will definitely miss their deadlines after the current transmission .",
    "so , the metric @xmath104 denotes the net benefit obtained from the current encoded packet and the transmission rate .",
    "thus , for each packet propagation , we aim to determine an encoded packet and select the transmission rate @xmath72 , that will maximize the metric @xmath104 .",
    "note that , the problem of maximizing the defined metric @xmath104 is also np - hard",
    ". we can prove it by considering its special case : the transmission rates on all the links are the same , the reception deadlines for all the packets are the transmission time of one packet , and each packet has the same benefit @xmath105 .",
    "the special case of maximizing the defined metric @xmath104 becomes to maximize the total number of the receivers that can decode one  wanted \" packet from the current encoded packet , which has been proved to be np - hard in @xcite .",
    "although maximizing the defined metric @xmath104 is also np - hard , we can easily obtain the following observations , based on which we can design the heuristic algorithm .",
    "p1 : maximizing the first term of the metric @xmath104 is equal to find a maximum weight clique in the graph , where the weight at vertex @xmath38 is defined as the benefit @xmath105 .",
    "p2 : the transmission rate is a parameter that adjusts the trade - off between delay and network coding gain . if @xmath0 uses a low transmission rate , more receivers can successfully receive the sending packet , and the current transmission may satisfy more receivers requirements , denoted by the first term in @xmath104 . however , low transmission rate means high transmission delay , which may cause more packets to miss their deadlines in the following transmission , denoted by the second term in @xmath104 .    based on the above observations , we then design a heuristic algorithm for each packet propagation , by gradually increasing the transmission rate .",
    "initially , the transmission rate is set to be no less than the lowest one from @xmath0 to its receivers .",
    "let @xmath114 be the set of available transmission rates from @xmath0 to all the destinations , and let @xmath115 be the @xmath116-th lowest rate in @xmath117 . as in sec .",
    "[ graph.model ] , we construct the auxiliary graph with the given information .",
    "we also assign the weight @xmath118 in vertex @xmath38 for @xmath119 to denote the benefit of @xmath27 .    in the @xmath116-th step ,",
    "we restrict that the transmission rate used at @xmath0 must be no less than @xmath115 . for @xmath23 ,",
    "if its maximum transmission rate from @xmath0 is less than @xmath115 , it can not successfully receive the sending packet .",
    "this restriction can be realized by omitting the vertex @xmath38 in @xmath36 if @xmath120 .",
    "then , we find the maximum weight clique in the subgraph @xmath121 , and adopt the transmission rate represented by the found clique .",
    "each vertex @xmath38 in the found clique denotes that @xmath27 will be successfully obtained by @xmath23 without missing its deadline , for the given transmission rate . for each of the other packets that can not be obtained at their receivers from the current transmission",
    ", we then judge whether it will definitely miss its deadline at its destinations , by ( [ eq.miss ] ) .",
    "thus , in each step , we calculate @xmath104 .",
    "such process continues until all the rates in @xmath117 are considered .",
    "finally , we compare the values of @xmath104 obtained from each step and adopt the one with the largest value as solution .",
    "note that , if there are more than one solution with the maximum value of @xmath104 , we will choose the one with the smaller lost represented by the second term of ( [ equation.u ] ) .",
    "the detailed of the algorithm is shown in algorithm 1 of fig .",
    "[ alg ] .      while algorithm 1 in sec .",
    "[ sec.algorithm.design ] describes the encoding of packets and selection of rate for every transmission , the whole transmission process will consist of multiple of such single process .",
    "we will first construct the graph @xmath36 based on model in sec .",
    "[ graph.model ] , and the graph will be updated by removing the selected vertices in the found clique by algorithm 1 , and the vertex @xmath38 if @xmath27 will definitely miss its deadline at destination @xmath23 .",
    "the packet reception deadlines for the packets also need to be updated after each transmission .",

    "[ sim.tradeoff ] , with the increase of the transmission rate , the number of packets that can be successfully received / decoded by their receivers from the current transmission decreases .",
    "the reason is that with the increase of the transmission rate , higher number of destinations may not receive the packets due to shorter transmission range , which thus decreases the encoding opportunity at @xmath0 .",
    "we can also see that with the increase of the transmission rate , the number of packets that will definitely miss their deadlines at the receivers decreases .",
    "this is because , higher transmission rates incur less transmission delay , which gives more chances for the other packets received timely in the following transmissions .",

    "<S> we design a novel joint rate selection and wireless network coding ( rsnc ) scheme with delay constraint , so as to minimize the total number of packets that miss their deadlines at the destination nodes . </S>",
