    "the necessity to search for alternatives to the standard big bang ( sbb ) scenario is driven by a significant number of problems within the theory such as the horizon , flatness , structure formation and cosmological constant problems .",
    "although inflationary models have managed to address many of these issues , all current formulations remain incomplete . in particular , the present models of inflation suffer from the fluctuation , super - planck scale physics , initial singularity and cosmological constant problems , as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , several theorems have appeared which show that de sitter spacetime , the simplest example of an inflationary universe , can not be a classical solution to supergravity theories  @xcite . as supergravity is the low energy limit of @xmath1-theory , it does not seem clear that a pure de sitter model of inflation will arise naturally within the theory .",
    "@xmath1-theory is currently our best candidate for a quantum theory of gravity . as such",
    ", the theory should provide the correct description of physics in regions of space with high energies and large curvature scales similar to those found in the initial conditions of the universe .",
    "therefore , it is only natural to incorporate string and @xmath1-theory into models of cosmology",
    ".   it is our hope that @xmath1-theory will provide answers to the pending questions of cosmology while preserving the triumphs of the sbb model ultimately leading to a complete description of the universe .",
    " brane gas cosmology \" ( bgc ) which is presented in  @xcite and based on the earlier work of  @xcite is one example of a cosmological scenario motivated by @xmath1-theory .",
    "the bgc model is relatively simple and starts out in close analogy with the standard big bang scenario .",
    "according to  @xcite , the initial state of the universe is small , dense , hot and with all fundamental degrees of freedom in approximate thermal equilibrium .   for simplicity",
    ", the background spatial geometry is assumed to be toroidal , and the universe is filled with a hot gas of @xmath2-branes , the fundamental objects appearing in string theories .",
    "these branes may wrap around the cycles of the torus ( winding modes ) , they can have a center - of - mass motion along the cycles ( momentum modes ) or they may simply fluctuate in the bulk space ( oscillatory modes ) . by symmetry , we assume equal numbers of winding and anti - winding modes . as the universe tries to expand ,",
    "the winding modes become heavy and halt the expansion  @xcite .",
    "spatial dimensions can only dynamically decompactify if the winding modes can disappear , and this is only possible ( for string winding modes ) in @xmath0 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "thus , bgc may provide an explanation for the observed number of large spatial dimensions .",
    "however , by causality at least one winding mode per hubble volume will be left behind , leading to the _ brane problem _ for bgc  @xcite , a problem analogous to the domain wall problem of standard cosmology .",
    "the present paper provides a simple solution to the brane problem : the winding modes will halt the expansion of the spatial sections , and lead to a phase of slight contraction ( _ loitering _",
    "@xcite ) during which the hubble radius becomes larger than the spatial sections and hence all remaining winding modes can annihilate in the large @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "we supplement the equations for the dilaton gravity background of bgc  @xcite by equations which describe the annihilation of string winding modes into string loops .",
    "a study of these equations demonstrates that solutions exist in which the winding modes force the universe to contract for a short time and enter a  loitering \" phase . during the phase of contraction the number density of the remaining winding modes increases and",
    "the winding and anti - winding modes begin to annihilate .",
    "the winding branes appear as solitons ( analogous to cosmic strings ) in the bulk space .",
    "the annihilation of winding and antiwinding modes ( analogous to cosmic string intersections ) leads to the production of string loops which have the same equation of state as cold matter .",
    "brane gas cosmology is a simple nonsingular model which addresses some of the problems of the sbb scenario , simultaneously providing a dynamical resolution to the dimensionality problem of string theory . in this respect",
    "it is very different from other attempts to incorporate @xmath1-theory into cosmology , such as  brane world \" scenarios in which our universe is located on the world volume of a 3-brane . in our opinion , brane world models suffer from a lack of cosmological motivation .",
    "all current models require that the extra dimensions be compactified by hand .",
    "although this is a serious problem from a cosmological viewpoint it is rarely , if ever , discussed .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "we begin with a brief review of the brane gas model in section  [ bg ] .",
    "our concrete starting point is presented , followed by a derivation of the equation of state for a gas of branes and an analysis of the background dynamics .",
    "this is followed ( in section  [ lu ] ) by a discussion of the dilaton gravity equations in the presence of a brane gas , of the benefits of loitering , and of attractor solutions . in section  [ lp ] ,",
    "we supplement the system of equations with equations which describe the annihilation of string winding modes into string loops , and based on this we provide a detailed analysis of a loitering solution .",
    "we use both numerical and analytical methods to study the solutions .",
    "we conclude , in section  [ conc ] , with a brief summary and a few conjectures concerning supersymmetry breaking , the effective breaking of t - duality , and dilaton mass generation in the late universe .",
    "the brane gas scenario of  @xcite is formulated within the context of eleven - dimensional @xmath1-theory compactified on @xmath3 .",
    "this leads to ten - dimensional , type ii - a string theory , whose low - energy effective action is that of supersymmetrized dilaton gravity .",
    "since @xmath1-theory admits the graviton , 2-branes and 5-branes as fundamental degrees of freedom , the compactification on @xmath3 leads to 0-branes , strings ( 1-branes ) , 2-branes , 4-branes , 5-branes , 6-branes and 8-branes in the ten - dimensional universe .",
    "the remaining nine spatial dimensions are assumed to be toroidal ( of radius @xmath4 ) .",
    "the universe starts out hot , dense and near thermal equilibrium .",
    "it is filled with a gas of all the branes ( wrapped and unwrapped ) which appear in the spectrum of the theory .      in this section",
    "we derive the equation of state of the brane gas described above .",
    "the gas consists of all the branes of spatial dimension @xmath2 .",
    "contributions of the winding , momentum and oscillatory modes are treated separately below .    the total action for the above model is the sum of the bulk effective action and the action of all the branes in the gas .",

    "fluctuations of each of the @xmath2-branes are described by the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action  @xcite and are coupled to the ten - dimensional action via delta function sources .",

    "the constant @xmath18 is given by the string length scale @xmath19 .",
    "the induced metric on the brane @xmath14 , ( with indices @xmath20 denoting spacetime dimensions parallel to the brane ) , is determined by the background metric @xmath7 and by scalar fields @xmath21 ( not to be confused with the dilaton @xmath8 ) living on the brane .",
    "the indices @xmath22 denote dimensions transverse to the brane and the @xmath21 describe the fluctuations of the brane in the transverse directions . in the string frame ,",
    "the tension of a @xmath2-brane , appearing in front of the action ( [ brane ] ) , is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the string coupling constant .",
    "we assume small string coupling so that the fluctuations of the branes will be small .",
    "we choose to work with conformal time @xmath25 in a background metric of the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the cosmological scale factor .    assuming that the transverse fluctuations of the brane and the gauge fields on the brane are small , it is possible to expand the brane action as @xmath28 the first term inside the parentheses in the last line represents the brane winding modes , the second term corresponds to the transverse fluctuations , and the third term relates to brane matter . in the low - energy limit",
    ", the transverse fluctuations of the brane are described by a free scalar field action , and the longitudinal fluctuations are given by a yang - mills theory .",
    "the induced equation of state which describes the second and third terms has pressure @xmath29 .",
    "we are now ready to compute the equation of state for the brane gases for various @xmath2 .",
    "there are three types of modes that we will need to consider .",
    "first , there are the winding modes .",
    "the background space is @xmath30 , and hence a @xmath2-brane can wrap around any set of @xmath2 toroidal directions .",
    "these modes are related by t - duality to the momentum modes corresponding to the center of mass motion of the branes .",
    "finally , the modes corresponding to fluctuations of the branes in the transverse directions are ( in the low - energy limit ) described by the scalar fields on the brane , @xmath21 .",
    "there are also bulk matter fields and brane matter fields .",
    "let us begin by considering the winding modes . from equation ( [ actexp ] ) , one can compute the equation of state for a winding @xmath2-brane : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the number of spatial dimensions , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 represent the pressure and energy density , respectively .",
    "both fluctuations of the branes and brane matter are described by free scalar and gauge fields living on the brane .",
    "these can be viewed as particles in the directions transverse to the brane and thus the equation of state is just that of ordinary matter : @xmath35 from the action ( [ actexp ] ) we see that the energy in the winding modes will be @xmath36 where the constant of proportionality is dependent on the number of branes .",
    "note that the energy in the winding modes increases with the expansion of the universe in contrast to the energy of the brane fluctuations and brane matter .",
    "the background equations of motion are calculated from the variation of ( [ sblk ] ) with the metric ( [ bkmet ] ) and were derived ( in the absence of @xmath9 ) in  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is convenient to define @xmath37 and to use the  shifted \" dilaton @xmath38 which absorbs the space volume factor . assuming for simplicity the isotropic case ( all @xmath39 and therefore @xmath40 ) the background equations are @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 denote the total energy and pressure , respectively .",
    "both sources @xmath42 and @xmath43 are made up from contributions of all the branes in the gas .",
    "we have already calculated these contributions in the previous section : @xmath44 where the superscripts @xmath45 and @xmath46 stand for the winding modes and the non - winding modes , respectively . here",
    "the contributions of the non - winding modes of all branes are combined into one term .",
    "the constants @xmath47 and @xmath45 are given by ( [ eoswind ] ) and ( [ eosnw ] ) .",
    "each @xmath48 is the sum of the energies of all of the winding branes with dimension @xmath2 .",
    "we now turn our attention to the model of brane gas cosmology proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the first important aspect of bgc is that it is free of the initial cosmological singularity of the sbb model .",
    "this can be explained by the t - duality symmetry of string theory as was first demonstrated in  @xcite .",
    "as the universe contracts , the t - duality self - dual fixed point ( @xmath49 ) is reached at some temperature @xmath50 less than the limiting hagedorn temperature . as the background continues to contract , the temperature _ decreases according to the t - duality equation for temperature , @xmath51 thus , there is no physical singularity as @xmath4 approaches @xmath52 . _    the t - duality symmetry of the spectrum of states was analyzed in @xcite in the absence of branes . with only fundamental string states , t - duality interchanges the winding and momentum quantum numbers of the same object .",
    "the action of t - duality on branes is more complicated  @xcite . a t - duality parallel to a @xmath2-brane produces a @xmath53-brane , while a t - duality perpendicular to a @xmath2-brane yields a @xmath54-brane .",
    "hence , after t - dualizing in all @xmath32 spatial dimensions , a @xmath2-brane becomes a @xmath55-brane .",
    "the @xmath2 winding modes of the initial @xmath2-brane are heavy , and the @xmath55 transverse momentum modes are light ( considering as starting point @xmath56 ) .",
    "after t - dualizing , the @xmath2 transverse momentum modes of the @xmath55-brane are heavy , and the @xmath55 winding modes are light ( since now the radius of the torus is @xmath57 ) . we conclude that the spectrum of states respects t - duality in the presence of branes .",
    "let us now examine the de - compactification mechanism which leads to three large spatial dimensions  @xcite .",
    "recall , that our starting point is a universe with nine spatial dimensions all equal and near the self - dual point , @xmath49 .",
    "the universe is in thermal equilibrium , and by symmetry we argue that there are equal numbers of winding and anti - winding modes .    as the universe begins to expand ( symmetrically in all directions ) , @xmath58 increases and the total energy in the winding modes increases according to equation  ( [ winden ] ) .",
    "note that the energy in the winding modes of the branes with the largest value of @xmath2 increases the fastest .",
    "therefore branes with the largest value of @xmath2 will have an important effect first .",
    "as we have already explained , the winding modes will prevent further expansion until they have annihilated .",
    "a simple counting argument demonstrates that the world - volumes of two @xmath2-branes will probably intersect in at most @xmath59 spatial dimensions .  .",
    "these particles will definitely interact ( assuming the space is periodic ) if @xmath60 , whereas they probably will not find each other in a space with @xmath61 .",
    "] clearly , in @xmath62 spatial dimensions the winding branes with @xmath63 and @xmath64 will have no problems interacting and self - annihilating .",
    "however , branes with smaller values of @xmath2 will allow a hierarchy of dimensions to expand .",
    "since the energy of the branes with the largest value of @xmath2 is greatest , the @xmath65-branes will first allow a @xmath66-dimensional torus to expand . within this @xmath67",
    ", the strings ( @xmath68-branes ) will allow a @xmath69 subspace to become large .",
    "hence , this mechanism provides a solution to the dimensionality problem of string theory and may explain the origin of our large @xmath0-dimensional universe .",
    "an important unsolved issue in brane gas cosmology is the stability of the radius of the compact dimensions to inhomogeneities as a function of the three coordinates @xmath70 ; @xmath71 corresponding to the large spatial dimensions .",
    "the separation in @xmath70 between the branes wrapping the small tori is increasing , and there appears to be no mechanism to keep the ",
    "internal \" dimensions from expanding ( inhomogeneously in @xmath70 ) between the branes .",
    "a simple but unsatisfactory solution , is to invoke a non - perturbative effect similar to what is needed to stabilize the dilaton at late times , namely to postulate a potential which will stabilize the moduli uniformly in @xmath70 ( after the winding modes around the @xmath70 directions have disappeared ) .",
    "work on a possible solution within the context of the framework presented here is in progress .",
    "despite the ability of winding modes to self - annihilate in a distinguished number of dimensions , causality demands that there is at least one winding mode per hubble volume remaining  @xcite . in our macroscopic four - dimensional spacetime , the wrapped branes with @xmath72 will appear as domain walls .",
    "the presence of such topological defects would result in a cosmological disaster , as even one wall per hubble volume today will overclose the universe if the tension of the brane is larger than the electroweak scale .",
    "this  domain wall problem \"  @xcite is common in cosmological scenarios based on quantum field theories which admit domain wall solutions .    as a solution of this  brane problem \" in bgc",
    "the authors of  @xcite suggested a phase of cosmological loitering .",
    "if at some stage in the evolution of the universe the hubble radius becomes larger than the spatial extent of the universe , there is no causal obstruction for all winding modes to annihilate .",
    "loitering allows for previously causally disconnected regions of the universe to communicate , and therefore provides a solution to the horizon problem of the sbb model .    within the context of dilaton gravity , cosmological solutions which exhibit a loitering phase",
    "appear rather naturally due to the presence of winding modes . to see this",
    ", we will examine the phase space of solutions to the background equations  ( [ eomback1 ] ) -  ( [ eomback3 ] ) .",
    "the phase space of solutions for general @xmath2 was discussed in  @xcite , and a numerical plot of the full phase space is given below .    by defining @xmath73 and @xmath74 , the background eom equations  ( [ eomback1 ] ) -  ( [ eomback3 ] ) simplify to two first order differential equations : @xmath75 notice that for positive energy density @xmath42 , equation  ( [ eomback1 ] ) implies that @xmath76 will never change sign .",
    "we are interested in studying the initial conditions with @xmath77 .",

    "thus , the state of the system is not symmetric under t - duality , and in the absence of string winding modes and for fixed dilaton , our background equations reduce to those of einstein s general relativity which do not exhibit the @xmath151 symmetry of string theory .",
    "it is also interesting to note that there seems to be a relation between the amount of supersymmetry in a theory and the presence of t - duality . using a specific example in  @xcite , aspinwall and plesser",
    "show that t - duality can be broken by nonperturbative effects in string coupling .",
    "furthermore , a holonomy argument is given to show that t - dualities should only be expected when large amounts of supersymmetry are present .",
    "it seems very likely that the dynamics in the bgc scenario will cause susy to break .",
    "this result seems to be in agreement with the possibility of dilaton mediated susy breaking occurring simultaneously with the breaking of t - duality .",
    "considering the above evidence we are inclined to hypothesize about the possible relations between supersymmetry breaking and the breaking of t - duality , as well as dilaton mass generation and the vanishing of winding modes .",
    "in this paper we have conducted a detailed analysis of a loitering phase in the model of brane gas cosmology presented in  @xcite .",
    "the concrete starting point of bgc is @xmath1-theory compactified on @xmath3 which gives ten - dimensional , type - iia string theory .",
    "we assume toroidal topology in all nine spatial dimensions .",
    "the initial conditions for the universe include a small , hot , dense gas of the @xmath2-branes in the theory .",
    "these fundamental degrees of freedom are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium .",
    "t - duality ensures that the initial singularity of the sbb model is not present in this scenario .",
    "we compute the equation of state for the brane gas system and the background equations of motion .",
    "we study the solutions which initiate in the energetically allowed region of the phase space .",
    "the universe tries to expand until winding modes force the expansion to stop and a phase of slow contraction ( loitering ) to begin .",
    "loitering provides a solution to the brane problem first discussed in  @xcite .",
    "it also provides a solution to the horizon problem of the sbb model without requiring an inflationary phase .",
    "the counting argument of  @xcite demonstrates that winding modes will allow a hierarchy of dimensions in the @xmath30 to grow large .",
    "when the string winding modes self - annihilate we are left with a large @xmath69 subspace , simultaneously explaining the origin of our @xmath0-dimensional universe and solving the dimensionality problem of string theory .",
    "branes wrapped around the cycles of the torus appear as solitons in the early universe .",
    "they are topological defects ( domain walls for @xmath152 ) .",
    "when the winding modes and anti - winding modes self - annihilate , matter is produced and the universe begins to expand again .",
    "we hypothesize that winding mode annihilation corresponds to dilaton mass generation .",
    "we also believe there may be a relation between susy breaking and the breaking of t - duality , although we can not provide any direct evidence for this .",
    "once winding states have vanished , we can not map momentum modes into winding modes via t - duality .",
    "the breaking of t - duality requires further study .",
    "particle phenomenology demands compactification on manifold with nontrivial holonomy such as calabi - yau three - folds if the four - dimensional low energy effective theory is to have @xmath153 supersymmetry .",
    "the initial steps towards generalizing the brane gas model to manifolds of nontrivial homology are discussed in  @xcite . however , in the context of early universe cosmology it is not reasonable to require @xmath153 supersymmetry .",
    "toroidal backgrounds , such as the one considered here , are compatible with maximal supersymmetry .",
    "brane gas cosmology provides a method of incorporating string and @xmath1-theory into cosmology which is an alternative to popular ",
    "brane world \" scenarios . in our opinion , bgc has the advantage over brane world scenarios in that its foundations are analogous to those of the standard big bang model . in the bgc model",
    "the universe starts out small , hot and dense , with no initial singularity .",
    "all the current versions of brane world scenarios embedded in string theories rely on the compactification of the extra dimensions by hand . in our opinion",
    "this is a considerable problem which is often overlooked .",
    "a dynamical mechanism in bgc leads naturally to four large space - time dimensions .",
