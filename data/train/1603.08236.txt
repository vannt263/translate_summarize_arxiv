    "the destination must compute @xmath243 , where @xmath244 are integers .",

    "we only consider symmetric rates here , i.e. , all sources have identical message sets .",
    "the rate of the code is @xmath246 .",
    "this problem is relevant in many applications such as exchange of messages in bidirectional relay networks , decoding messages over the gaussian multiple access channel  @xcite , and designing good receivers for mimo channels  @xcite to name a few .",
    "the basic idea is that instead of decoding the messages one at a time and using successive cancellation , it may be more efficient to decode multiple linear combinations of the messages . if we have @xmath232 linearly independent such combinations , then we can recover all the individual messages .",
    "we can extend the scheme of  @xcite to a concatenated coding scheme that achieves the rates guaranteed by  @xcite , but now with encoders and decoders that operate in polynomial time . recall that the messages are chosen from @xmath238 .",
    "we say that a rate @xmath247 is achievable if for every @xmath80 , there exists a sequence of encoders and decoders so that for all sufficiently large blocklengths @xmath1 , we have the transmission rate @xmath248 , and the probability of error is less than @xmath163 .",

    "[ lemma : cf_lowcomplexity ]    see appendix  a.      the technique of concatenation can also be used to improve the error performance of other lattice codes that achieve the capacity of the awgn channel .",
    "for example , polar lattices  @xcite have an error probability that decays as @xmath4 for any @xmath5 , and lda lattices  @xcite have an error probability that behaves as @xmath252 .",
    "it is easy to show that if @xmath210 denotes the probability of error of the inner nested lattice code , then the probability of error of the ( both rs and expander ) concatenated code is @xmath253 for some @xmath102 . in any case",
    ", the probability of error goes to zero as @xmath254 irrespective of whether we use polar or lda lattices .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the probability of error decays as @xmath255 for the corresponding reed - solomon concatenated ( polar / lda ) lattice code and @xmath256 for the corresponding expander concatenated ( polar / lda ) lattice codes . the decoding complexities would grow as @xmath0 ( for rs concatenated codes ) and @xmath2 ( for expander concatenated codes ) respectively .",
    "we have seen that concatenation can be a very powerful tool in reducing the asymptotic decoding complexity of nested lattice codes . however , it must be noted that achieving good performance using this scheme would require very large blocklengths .",
    "although the probability of error decays exponentially in @xmath1 , and the decoding / encoding complexities are polynomial in @xmath1 , this is true only for very large values of @xmath1 .",
    "the fact that @xmath1 is at least exponential in the blocklength of the inner code is a major reason for this .",
    "nevertheless , the concatenated coding approach shows that it is possible to obtain polynomial - time encoders and decoders for which the probability of error decays exponentially in the blocklength .",
    "the exponential decay is under the assumption that the gap between the transmission rate and capacity , @xmath257 , is kept fixed . for a fixed error probability @xmath258 ,",
    "the blocklength required by the concatenated coding scheme to achieve rate @xmath259 and error probability @xmath258 does not scale polynomially with @xmath260 . for a fixed error probability , we would like the complexity to not grow too fast as the rate approaches @xmath9 .",
    "it has been recently shown that polar codes have this property for binary memoryless symmetric channels  @xcite . designing codes for the gaussian channel whose decoding / encoding complexities",
