    "the resulting surface f enhancement , also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : focono3dup ] , is much smaller than in the star .",
    "clearly , the elucidation of the differences between the solar - system fluorine abundance and that of normal k and m giants remains a challenge for future studies . in sect .",
    "[ sect : thirddredge - up ] , devoted to the analysis of the surface fluorine abundance resulting from the third dredge - up , we will therefore normalize our predictions in such a way that the pre - agb abundance corresponds to the average value observed in solar - metallicity k and m giants ( fig .",

    "after a pulse , the convective envelope extends inward and , in some cases , can penetrate the layers formerly involved in the thermal pulse .",
    "when this happens , the he - burning ashes , like and , are mixed in the convective envelope and brought to the surface .",
    "this process , called _ third dredge - up _ , accounts for the gradual transformation of a m star into a s and then c star along the agb .",
    "though the very existence of s and c stars on the agb supports the occurrence of such dredge - ups , our stellar models like most others fail in obtaining this process in a self - consistent way .",
    "no fully self - consistent comparison of the observed abundances with our predictions is thus possible .",
    "nevertheless , a comparison is attempted by parametrizing the dredge - ups .",
    "two parameters need to be specified for that purpose : ( i ) the depth @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the mass of matter from the pulse mixed into the convective envelope , and @xmath120 is the mass involved in the pulse ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pulsem3z02 ] ) ; ( ii ) the pulse number @xmath121 after which the third dredge - up first occurs .",
    "it is then assumed that dredge - ups with the same depth @xmath122 occur after each subsequent pulses .",
    "though these free parameters introduce some uncertainties in our predictions , it was shown in paper i ( eq .",
    "3.2 ) that the use of the ( c / o , f / o ) diagram strongly limits their impact .",
    "actually , predictions almost independent of @xmath122 can be made by using this diagram .",
    "the parametric dredge - up calculations start with the envelope abundances at pulse @xmath121 as given by the detailed models .",
    "these envelope abundances are then modified after each subsequent pulse by mixing into the envelope the matter from the underlying layers , until a fraction @xmath122 of the ashes of the pulse has been dredged up .",
    "the abundance profiles are taken from the detailed model calculations . when hbb is taking place , as in the m6z02 star ( sect .",
    "[ sect : m6z02 ] ) , its effect on the envelope abundances is incorporated in the parametric calculations by correcting the abundances by an amount equal to the relative variation obtained during the interpulse in the detailed calculations .",
    "figure  [ fig : foco ] displays how the surface ( c / o , f / o ) ratios vary in the m3z02 and m6z02 stars as a result of the dredge - ups . as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect : firstdredge - up ] , our predictions are normalized in such a way that the surface f abundance prior to any dredge - up corresponds to the average f abundance observed in k and m giants .",
    "predictions are given for @xmath123 , 4 and 9 , with a dredge - up depth @xmath124 .",
    "in the case of the m3z02 star , the surface fluorine overabundances at a given / ratio are the largest for @xmath125 as expected , since the intershell fluorine abundance saturates from pulse 9 onwards in that star ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n15f19m3z02 ] ) .",
    "however , even in this case , our predictions can only account for the lowest observed fluorine overabundances .",
    "predictions with @xmath126 lead to slopes in the ( c / o , f / o ) diagram similar to the ones obtained with @xmath124 , and are not reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : foco ] for clarity .",
    "the above conclusion is thus independent of the dredge - up parameter @xmath122 .    in the m6z02 star , the dredge - ups",
    "do not lead to any significant f overabundances .",
    "this is due to the combined effects of the large dilution of the intershell in the massive envelope , and to hbb . even though a slight increase in the surface f abundance is predicted during the early pulses , due mainly to fluorine production in the envelope itself ( see sect .",
    "[ sect : m6z02 ] ) , the operation of hbb at later pulses prevents any further increase .",
    "moreover , by converting the envelope into , hbb leads to a decrease of the / ratio in these massive agb stars .",
    "therefore , it is rather unlikely that the giants exhibiting large f / o ratios have experienced hbb , unless their f / o and c / o ratios prior to the onset of hbb were even larger than their present values . but according to the present models , massive agb stars are not very efficient in increasing their surface f abundance even in the absence of hbb .    in this respect ,",
    "wz  cas is a puzzling case .",
    "this star is known to be super li - rich ( denn , luck & lambert 1991 , abia et al .",
    "1993 ) , to have a low / ratio , and to be enriched in s - process elements ( dominy 1985 ) .",
    "lithium is produced in the envelope of massive agb stars ( sackmann & boothroyd 1992 ) having temperatures @xmath127 at their base ( mowlavi 1995b ) .",
    "as no large surface f overabundances are expected in these typical hbb conditions , the combination of large li and f excesses at the surface of wz  cas remains unexplained so far .",
    "more observations of f abundances in super li - rich stars are needed to know whether such a combination is common among these stars .",
    "it is noteworthy that j stars ( represented by open triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : foco ] ) exhibit rather large f overabundances .",
    "this class of giants is characterized by low / ratios and no s - process overabundances ( lambert et al .",
    "1986 , dominy 1985 ) . since",
    "their n abundance is not especially high , hbb alone seems inadequate to account for their peculiar abundances .",
    "the combination of low / and high / ratios is also puzzling in that respect , as the extensive hydrogen burning implied by the low / ratio is also expected to destroy any pre - existing , unless hydrogen burning occurs at @xmath111 ( sect .",
    "[ sect : m6z02 ] ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "the surface f abundances predicted for the intermediate - mass stars considered in this paper are in rather poor agreement with the observations displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : foco ] .",
    "the predicted f abundances in the m3z02 star are just able to account for the lowest observed overabundances",
    "( at a given c / o ratio ) .",
    "that conclusion is almost independent of the parameters @xmath122 and @xmath121 .",
    "actually , a better match to the observations would require to increase the / ratio in the pulses by a factor of at least 10 ( see eq .  1 and fig .",
    "9 of paper  i ) , i.e. @xmath128(@xmath129 in the pulse .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : f19asymptotic ] ) indicates that the maximum production level in the pulse is fixed by the available supply . for secondary supplied by the cno cycles operating in the hydrogen - burning shell , @xmath130 , and",
    "the required production level is thus not achieved .",
    "that conclusion holds true for low - mass stars .",
    "it seems thus unavoidable that the most f - rich stars of fig .  [",
    "fig : foco ] require a _",
    "primary _ supply resulting possibly from a non - standard mixing of protons with the pocket left over by the pulse ( e.g. hollowell & iben 1988 ) . since a similar need for a primary supply is in fact coming from the heavy - element overabundances observed in the same stars ( smith & lambert 1990 ) , one may expect the f and s - process overabundances to be correlated .",
    "the fact that the most f - rich stars are also the most heavy element - rich ( fig .",
    "12 of paper i ) and the most n - rich ( at a given c / o ratio ; underlined symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : foco ] ) provides evidence for primary and supplies in these stars .",
    "-1.0 cm    another important constraint on the models comes from the surface abundance . in paper",
    "ii , large overabundances , not supported by the observations ( smith & lambert 1990 ) , were predicted to result from the third dredge - up . the new reaction rate ( giesen et al . 1994 ) , which is faster than the cf88 rate used in paper  ii by a factor of 100 at @xmath131 , removes the discrepancy .",
    "figure  [ fig : o18 ] displays the after - pulse intershell mass fraction as a function of the maximum pulse temperature , as well as the envelope abundance prior to any third dredge - up in the m3z02 star .",
    "it is seen that the after - pulse abundance drops below the envelope abundance after the 4th pulse in the m3z02 star .",
    "therefore , in order to prevent surface overabundances , third dredge - ups should occur after the 4th pulse in that star .",
    "the overabundance may however be more difficult to avoid in low - mass stars , where pulses are cooler .",
    "surface fluorine abundances resulting from parametrized third dredge - ups are predicted for the m3z001 star in a similar way as for the solar - metallicity stars ( sect .",
    "[ sect : thirddredge - up ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that these predictions for the low - metallicity star rely on several important assumptions regarding the _ initial _ envelope abundances . in our models ,",
    "all initial abundances are taken equal to the solar - system values , scaled to the metallicity by the factor z / z@xmath132 .",

    "the initial abundance in the envelope of the m3z001 star has been corrected correspondingly . with these assumptions , the starting point of the dredge - up tracks in the ( /,[/ ] ) diagram corresponds to ( 0.12,-0.52 ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : focoz001 ] ) .",
    "-1.0 cm    as can be seen on fig .",
    "[ fig : focoz001 ] , third dredge - up episodes in the m3z001 star do not alter the surface fluorine abundance as strongly as in the solar - metallicity stars ( fig .",
    "[ fig : foco ] ) .",
    "the increase in [ / ] with respect to its initial value is only 0.1  dex after a dozen of pulses , to be compared with as much as 0.4  dex in the solar - metallicity stars .",
    "the less steep slopes predicted in the ( c / o , f / o ) diagram for the m3z001 star result from the combination of two effects : ( i ) the lower fluorine production efficiency in the hot pulses of the low - metallicity star as compared to the ones in the solar - metallicity cases ( compare figs .",
    "[ fig : n15f19m3z02 ] and [ fig : n15f19m3z001 ] ) . the largest surface f overabundances in the m3z001 star",
    "are therefore obtained when the dredge - ups occur after the early , cool pulses ( compare tracks labeled _ 1 _ and _ 9 _ in fig .  [",
    "fig : focoz001 ] ) ; ( ii ) the primary nature of produced in the pulse , as compared to the secondary nature of in our models .",
    "this leads to / ratios in the dredge - up material lower in low - metallicity stars than in solar - metallicity stars .    in conclusion ,",
    "rather small f overabundances are expected in low - metallicity agb stars , in the case that the fluorine production results from secondary only .",
    "observations of f in low - metallicity giants would definitely be of great interest .",
    "detailed calculations of fluorine production have been performed in intermediate - mass stars with ( m / m@xmath132 ,  z ) = ( 6 ,  0.02 ) , ( 3 ,  0.02 ) and ( 3 ,  0.001 ) .",
    "it is confirmed that produced in pulses through @xmath53 , the necessary protons coming from ( n , p ) reactions with neutrons supplied by .",
    "three different regimes of fluorine production can be identified :    \\1 ) in pulses with maximum base temperatures @xmath137 , is produced _ within the pulse_. for @xmath138 , is however too slow to produce significant amounts of f. the maximum fluorine production is reached for @xmath139 , at a level limited by the supply and the efficiency @xmath84 of production in the reaction chain starting at .",
    "typical values for the efficiency are @xmath140 , and depend mainly upon the fraction of available neutrons involved in ( n , p ) reactions . and are the main neutron - to - proton converters . the efficiency is found to depend also on the overlap factor between successive pulses .",

    "however , the temperature of the intershell region now gets high enough for to be produced _ in radiative layers _ during the interpulse period . when injected in the next pulse , that is entirely converted into by @xmath26-captures . the efficiency of production is lower in radiative layers than in a pulse ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "the intershell nuclei not burned during the interpulse period are ingested by the pulse close to the time of maximum pulse temperature . at these high temperatures , is fast enough to substantially reduce the number of seeds available to .",

    "the evolution of the after - pulse fluorine abundance @xmath144 in the intershell zone is dictated by the succession of these three regimes .",

    "@xmath144 drops until it reaches a plateau , with a level fixed by the efficiency @xmath147 .",
    "finally , @xmath148 decreases steadily when regime 3 operates in the late pulses . _ the optimum f production in agb stars",
    "is achieved for thermal pulses having maximum base temperatures in the range @xmath149_.    all three regimes have been encountered in the m3z001 star where the pulse temperatures reach @xmath107 at the 4th pulse and 300 at the 13th . the plateau corresponding to the second regime is reached after 9 pulses in that star . the m6z02 star enters regime 2 at the 7th pulse , while the m3z02 star is still in regime 1 after 13 pulses .",
    "comparing our predictions of surface fluorine abundances with the observations leads to the following conclusions :    \\i ) neither the first nor the second dredge - ups can account for the observed discrepancy between the solar - system fluorine abundance and that of normal k and m giants .",
