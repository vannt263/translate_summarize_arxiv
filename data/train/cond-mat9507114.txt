    "the effects of quantum fluctuations on phase transitions is a topic of significant current research . on the other hand transition into a glassy phase in disordered systems is a topic which is far from trivial and requires special analytical and numerical techniques .",
    "in particular the behavior of interfaces in disordered systems has been the subject of many recent papers [ 1 - 12 ] .",
    "it is of interest to investigate the combined effect of disorder and quantum fluctuations that play a significant role at low temperatures .    in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "we have focused on the problem of a quantum particle in a random potential with power law correlations plus a fixed harmonic restoring force .",
    "this problem has previously been studied classically @xcite , by using the variational approximation @xcite(or alternatively the large @xmath3-limit @xcite , where @xmath3 is the number of dimensions ) .",
    "a transition into a glassy phase has been identified .",
    "the signature of such a transition is the appearance of solutions with replica - symmetry - breaking ( rsb ) @xcite .",
    "rsb is typically associated with a complicated free - energy landscape characterized by many local minima which are separated by high barriers . a sharp transition for",
    "a single particle must be an artifact of the variational approximation ( or alternatively the large-@xmath3 limit ) . in reality",
    "this must be a crossover effect over a range of temperatures .",
    "the `` toy '' model of a particle in a random potential in one dimension is the simplest example of an interface problem where the location of the particle stands for the location of an interface between to phases ( like up an down spins ) and the random potential stands for quenched impurities which can pin the interface .",
    "understanding of this problem is the first step of investigating higher dimensional manifolds .",
    "but the quantum version of the model also apply directly to a particle like an electron in a dirty metal @xcite , where the strength of the harmonic potential can be tuned to mimic a finite box which the electron is confined to , like the situation which occurs in certain mesoscopic systems .    the question we have had in mind was what were the effects of quantum fluctuations on this glassy transition .",
    "there are some similarities between this problem and the quantum spin - glass problem in a transverse field@xcite . in that problem , tunneling effects produced by the transverse field eventually lead , for strong enough field to the destruction of the spin - glass phase . but this phase when it exists , is still characterized by replica - symmetry - breaking ( rsb ) , for the infinite range model . with this analogy in mind , one should notice though , that the transition which has been found for a particle in a random potential @xcite is of the almeida - thouless type @xcite in the sense that it is associated with the appearance of rsb but not with an order - disorder ( spin - glass like ) transition",

    "we find as before that the glassy phase , characterized by rsb persists in the presence of quantum fluctuations .",
    "however , we find that for small enough particle mass , ( m and @xmath4 enter only in the combination @xmath5 ) the glassy phase ceases to exists .",
