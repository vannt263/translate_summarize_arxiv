    "the unitarity of the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , @xmath5 , is a fundamental aspect of the standard model and any deviation would represent clear evidence of new physics .",
    "the most accurate test of unitarity involves the ( 11 ) element of @xmath6  @xcite , namely @xmath7 this remarkable result is primarily a triumph of decades of precise studies of super - allowed nuclear @xmath0-decay , which at the present time yields a more accurate value of @xmath2 , namely @xmath8 , than studies of the free neutron .    in the light of the remarkable level of accuracy that has been obtained , as well as the improvements anticipated in the near future",
    ", we feel that it is timely to address once more the issue of two corrections which are little discussed .",
    "the first issue concerns the effect of the mean scalar field in the nucleus . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the difference between the radius of a neutron and a proton would grow with density and it was then claimed that this would lead to a violation of the behrends - sirlin - ademollo - gatto  @xcite ( bsag ) theorem .",
    "this result , which was a consequence of an incorrect application of the constraint equations in the bag model , is wrong . indeed",
    ", suppose that the @xmath9 and @xmath10 masses are equal in a nucleon immersed in an _ isoscalar _ scalar field .",
    "as @xmath11 and @xmath12 move apart the bsag theorem must apply whatever the scalar field and one must not obtain a correction to the fermi matrix element linear in @xmath13 . of course , the coefficient of the term in @xmath14 _ may _ change and we estimate this effect here .",
    "it is very small .    on the other hand ,",
    "when we calculate the change in the fermi matrix element in a manner consistent with bsag , it turns out that at the physical value of @xmath15 it is no longer totally negligible in comparison with the current errors on @xmath2 .",
    "the reduction in the overlap of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 wave functions turns out to be of order @xmath16 . finally , we combine this calculation with an earlier estimate of the effect of pion mass differences carried out using chiral perturbation theory , in order to obtain a total correction . when applied to the unitarity test in eq .",
    "( [ eq : unitarity ] ) , the total correction amounts to about @xmath17 .    as a final note on the possibility of a genuine correction associated with the nucleon decaying in - medium",
    ", we point out that the relatively small isovector scalar potential ( in the qmc model associated with the @xmath18 meson ) expected in nuclei with @xmath19 will serve to effectively increase the value of @xmath20 by an amount @xmath21",
    ". the latter may be as large as 4 or 5 mev in a heavy nucleus and this could produce a decrease in the apparent value of @xmath2 as large as @xmath16 , depending on the neutron - proton asymmetry of the particular nucleus . while for the present this is below the level at which it could be detected it is a systematic error which may need to be accounted for in the near future .",
    "in terms of the quark field isodoublet @xmath22 , the fermi operator for @xmath0 decay is @xmath23 it is related to the generators @xmath24 of the isospin transformations @xmath25 which are conserved by strong interactions in the isospin symmetry limit . in the following",
    "we assume that the quark mass difference @xmath26 is the only source of isospin breaking .",
    "so we write the exact hamiltonian of the strong interaction as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the isospin symmetric part : @xmath29=0.$ ] even in the presence of the symmetry breaking term @xmath30 the isospin generators satisfy the current algebra relations @xmath31=i\\epsilon^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}t^{\\gamma}\\ ] ] and combined with the fact that @xmath32\\sim\\delta m$ ] this leads to the bsag theorem for the fermi matrix element : @xmath33 we wish to estimate how the overlap defect @xmath34 changes when the neutron is in the nuclear medium and the challenge is to do that in a way consistent with bsag .",
    "when we naively use the bag model to compute @xmath35 , as originally done in the qmc model , we have the problem that the bag radius depends on the flavor content .",
    "as it changes during the @xmath36 transition , there is a lack of orthogonality between the eigenmodes of the initial and final bag and this leads to an overlap defect of order @xmath37 clearly this is an artefact of the static bag model which , by definition , can not handle a radius which changes with time , as is the case in a @xmath0 decay .    since this overlap artefact arises from the small mass difference @xmath38",
    "the correct approch is to start with the isospin symmetry limit and use the bag model only to compute the deviation from unity .",
    "we then find that this deviation is explicitly of order @xmath39  as it should be .",
    "higher order deviations can also be computed in this framework but we stop at order @xmath39 , which is quite sufficient for our purpose .",
    "we denote as @xmath40 , the eigenstates of @xmath28 with isospin 1/2 .",
    "@xmath41 the nucleon corresponds to @xmath42 .",
    "the exact proton and neutron states are @xmath43 such that @xmath44 let @xmath45 be the projector onto @xmath46 and @xmath47 we have @xmath48 with @xmath49 independent of @xmath50    using @xmath51 we have , up to @xmath52 contributions : latexmath:[\\ ] ] in the following we assume that @xmath78 is larger than the critical value @xmath79 at which @xmath80 this is not a restriction in normal nuclei .",
    "the scalar matrix element is then @xmath81 we show the resultant overlap defect as a function of density for nuclear parameters  @xcite in fig .  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the @xmath1 mass difference has been set to 5 mev , which is appropriate to the mit bag  @xcite .",
    "the overlap defect changes by only a few times @xmath82 as the density varies from zero to nuclear matter density .",
    "although the variation of the fermi matrix element with density is small , we note from fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] that the intercept at zero density is around @xmath83 , which is only a factor of 10 smaller than the current error quoted for @xmath2 .",
    "while such a deviation from unity for the hadronic form factor is carefully handled in the @xmath84 transition , it seems to receive little attention in the literature in the @xmath85 transition .",
    "indeed , we found only the discussion by kaiser@xcite , in the framework of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "that work reported a total reduction from the mass difference between charged and neutral pions of about @xmath86 .",
    "the additional contribution from the difference between the @xmath87 and @xmath88 coupling constants , which is of order 0.4%  @xcite , produces a negligible defect , well below @xmath82 .",
    "the pionic correction of kaiser and the correction from the valence quark overlap calculated here are independent and hence the total correction is @xmath89 .",
    "thus one should increase the value of @xmath2 deduced from the analysis of super - allowed fermi @xmath0-decay by this amount . as noted earlier ,",
    "this amounts to an increase in the value of @xmath3 by around @xmath17 , which is only a factor of 5 below the error quoted in eq .",
    "( [ eq : unitarity ] ) .    while the absence of a sizeable correction to @xmath90 in - medium is reassuring , we note that there is a genuine correction which has so far been ignored , involving the isovector mean scalar field .",
    "this is often ignored because the coupling is so much smaller than that for the isoscalar case , but if the mean isovector scalar field felt by the quark is @xmath91 , the isospin breaking term will be proportional to @xmath92 .",
    "this could potentially double the deviation associated with the quark mass difference , depending on the neutron excess and structure of the particular nucleus under consideration .",
    "it will be interesting to explore this effect quantitatively in future as well as to investigate the model dependence of isospin breaking term calculated here within the mit bag model .",
    "this work was suppported by the cea ( pamg ) and by an australian laureate fellowship and the university of adelaide ( awt ) .",
