    "this paper provides a rigourous mathematical analysis of some aspects of spray combustion , including the analysis of the so - called high activation energy limit for a spray flame model .",
    "this notion of high activation energy limit was first introduced in the pioneering work of zeldovich and frank - kamenetskii @xcite , and refers to the limit where the combustion rate is much faster than any other physical phenomenon , in particular diffusion . since then , there have been many studies of these asymptotics and applications to gaseous flames . however , gas - vapor - droplets systems have many applications in industry or everyday s life , such as diesel or propulsion engines .",
    "when trying to understand some of their specific features , it appears that the structure of these two - phase flames as well as their speed or stability are greatly affected by the presence of vaporising liquid droplets possibly interacting with the combustion zone .",
    "the behaviour of spray flames has been investigated a lot in the literature and a wide variety of regimes were considered .",
    "dating from the 70s and early 80s , we can quote the works of polymeropoulos et al .",
    "@xcite@xcite , mizutani et al .",
    "@xcite@xcite , hayashi et al .",
    "ballal et al .",
    "@xcite . they present studies of the propagation of liquid fuel sprays , study the influence of the size of the droplets , the type and geometry of the spray flame as well as its structure .",
    "the investigation of those vapor  drop  air systems was continued in the 90s . to quote but a few works",
    ", we refer to the work of aggarwal and sirignano @xcite as well as the papers of greenberg , tambour and silverman @xcite@xcite , where the structure of spray flames as well as the influence of parameters such as droplet size , fuel volatility , or equivalence ratio are also investigated analytically .",
    "more elaborate situations appearing in propulsion engines are for example pulsating or acoustic instabilities .",
    "we refer to @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite and more recently @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite for studies in that direction .",
    "only few of these studies of spray flames involve rigorous  in  the  mathematical  sense analysis of spray flames models where existence , uniqueness , or asymptotic limits are derived ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is in contrast with purely gaseous combustion , where a lot of results exist in the mathematical literature for various regimes and asymptotics . in particular ,",
    "a complete study of thermo - diffusive lean gaseous flame fronts and the high activation energy limit is in the paper of berestycki , nicolaenko and scheurer @xcite , and in the paper of berestycki and larrouturou @xcite .",
    "the originality of the present work is to provide a complete mathematical analysis of the counterpart of those systems , namely a lean * spray * flame model that on the hand is * simple enough * to allow for explicit asymptotic limits , and on the other hand * rich enough * to capture some particular aspects of spray combustion .",
    "those results should be compared with the very interesting work of suard , nicoli and haldenwang @xcite . using numerical simulations ,",
    "these authors investigate the scaling laws of the spray flame with respect to the vaporisation rate of the liquid phase .",
    "when the vaporisation is fast enough , the velocity of the spray flame is comparable to that of the gaseous flame where the whole reactant would be present only in a gaseous form .",
    "this is the * diffusion controlled * regime . on the contrary when the time for complete vaporisation exceeds a critical value ,",
    "the velocity of the spray flame starts to decrease .",
    "this is the so  called * vaporisation controlled * regime . in this case",
    ", they also investigated the structure of the reaction zone , and showed that it has a more complex structure than a gaseous flame .    in this work",
    ", we prove the existence of spray flame travelling waves and the existence of * two distinct combustion regimes * with a sharp transition in the * high activation energy * ( * hae * ) . in this limit ,",
    "we provide a complete characterisation of the profiles , that can be written explicitly provided simple analytic expressions of the vaporisation law .",
    "we also show that the internal combustion layer is likely to be much larger in the vaporisation controlled regime as compared to the size of the internal combustion layer of a comparable gaseous flame .",
    "a gas mixture of total mass density @xmath0 is considered to be made of @xmath1 fluids corresponding to the different species present in the mixture .",
    "if the mass density of those species are @xmath2 then by definition @xmath3 , and the respective mass fractions @xmath4 of the species are defined by @xmath5 . in the case of a single reactant @xmath6",
    ", the chemical reaction writes as @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the reactant species and @xmath9 denotes one ( or a linear combination ) of the species produced by the reaction .",
    "notice that the rate of variation of the single reactant @xmath8 is directly proportional to minus that of the products and it suffices to determine the mass fraction @xmath6 of the reactant @xmath8 in order to determine the mass fractions of the other species .",
    "the mass , momentum , energy equation for a reactive flow in one dimension without external forces write , setting @xmath10 , @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the mass  average velocity of the mixture , @xmath15 the hydrostatic pressure , @xmath16 the dynamic viscosity coefficient , @xmath17 the temperature , @xmath18 the specific heat at constant pressure , @xmath19 the thermal conductivity , @xmath20 the chemical heat release of the reaction and @xmath21 is the rate at which the reaction occurs and has the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the activation energy of the single reaction , @xmath24 the perfect gas constant , @xmath25 the activation energy temperature , @xmath26 the molecular mass of the reactant @xmath8 , and @xmath27 a non  stiff prefactor .",
    "finally the equation for the mass fraction @xmath6 of the reactant @xmath8 obeys @xmath28 we refer the reader to @xcite for more details .      in the situation where",
    "the reactant @xmath8 is also present in the mixture in the form of vaporising liquid droplets that are well dispersed in the mixture , one can treat the liquid phase as a new continuous `` species '' , where the droplets are homogeneously spread inside the mixture , leading to both homogeneized vaporisation and combustion in the bulk of the gaseous phase .",
    "this is certainly not satisfied in practice , where spray combustion can typically involve flames surrounding individual droplets , with strong temperature gradients within the flame .",
    "however , we need this hypothesis for the derivation of our model . also , ideally the continuity equation for the gaseous mixture should take into account the volume fraction occupied by the liquid phase , the momentum equation should incorporate the drag forces , the energy equation should include the loss of heat due to the latent heat of the liquid as well as the dissipation due to the drag forces , etc .",
    "we are going to consider regimes in which we can discard those couplings .",
    "since the mass density of the liquid reactant @xmath8 is in general several orders of magnitude larger than that of the gaseous species , on can assume that the volume fraction of the liquid phase is small .",
    "the drag forces are always present and can produce complex turbulent flows . however , the drag force is typically inversely proportional to the surface area of the droplets and proportional to the difference of velocities of the droplets and the surrounding gas .",
    "small enough droplets behave as `` passive scalars '' , that is particles whose velocity can be set equal to that of the surrounding fluid .",
    "the drag forces are internal forces for the two - phase flow and do not affect the total momentum @xmath29 of the liquid  gas mixture . as a consequence , since @xmath30 , one can neglect the drag forces in the gaseous mixture if the mass density @xmath31 of the liquid phase is small enough compared to the mass density @xmath0 of the gas mixture .",
    "the same conclusion holds for the energy equation .",
    "let now @xmath32 denote the mass of an isolated vaporising droplet immersed in a gas .",
    "the vaporisation law of the droplet can be very complex ( see e.g. @xcite ) . as an approximation",
    ", we will assume that the vaporisation rate @xmath33 only depends upon the temperature @xmath17 of the surrounding gas and the mass @xmath32 of the droplet , i.e. @xmath34 we will be mainly interested in the monodisperse case , where all droplets in the unburnt gas have the same size . in the laminar flows with constant velocity that we will be considering , this implies that particles located at the same position @xmath35 at time @xmath36 all have the same size .",
    "we can therefore introduce the mass profile @xmath37 which obeys , @xmath38 the situation for polydisperse sprays is briefly considered in the hae limit in section [ s : extensions ] .",
    "let further @xmath39 be the number density of droplets , that is the number of droplets per unit volume .",
    "the mass density of the liquid phase writes @xmath40 . in the laminar",
    "flows we are considering , the droplets do not coalesce nor break  up , hence @xmath41 that is the number density of the droplets is simply advected by the flow , and @xmath42 .",
    "it follows that the continuity equation for the gaseous reactant @xmath8 now incorporates the vaporisation flux as a source term @xmath43    finally , we assume that the effects of the latent heat are negligible .",
    "this is true when the mass density of the liquid phase is small enough compared to that of the gaseous mixture , which we assumed also in order to neglect the drag forces .",
    "the study of the influence of the latent heat is certainly an important and interesting feature since it can greatly influence the speed or existence of the flame .",
    "however this study is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we are interested in laminar , low mach number , regimes where one can neglect the pressure terms as well as the kinematic viscosity .",
    "we want to study the existence and properties of travelling waves moving at constant speed @xmath44 to the left . in the frame of reference of an observer moving at speed @xmath44 to the left , the profiles are steady , solution to the system @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47",
    "@xmath48 @xmath49 from the continuity equation , the mass flux @xmath50 is a constant .",
    "moreover @xmath51 implies @xmath52 in the moving frame , and therefore also @xmath53 , so that the gas density is constant , @xmath54 . setting also @xmath55 , a constant",
    ", the system reduces to @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 with prescribed values @xmath59 in the unburnt region , @xmath60 and assuming complete reaction and complete vaporisation on the burnt region @xmath61 the temperature @xmath62 in the burnt region is obtained by integrating the equation for the quantity @xmath63 on @xmath64 .",
    "it follows @xmath65      the normalized variables are @xmath66 defined as @xmath67 solution to the system , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the reciprocal of the lewis number , and with appropriate renormalized formulas for the reaction rate @xmath70 and the vaporisation rate @xmath71 ( we omit the tildes below ) .",
    "also @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "in order to avoid the cold boundary effect , we assume that the reaction rate is zero below the normalized ignition temperature @xmath76 , namely @xmath77 \\rightarrow \\mathbbm{r}^{+}$ ] , @xmath78 , for all @xmath79 , @xmath80 positive on @xmath81 $ ] and lipschitz continuous on @xmath82 $ ] .    for the study of the high activation energy limit , we will use on @xmath83 $ ] the normalized arrhenius law @xmath84 where @xmath85 denotes the inverse of the ( normalized ) activation temperature .",

    "be given any temperature @xmath98 , with @xmath99 , and any mass @xmath96 .",
    "we finally make the natural assumption that the interval of time @xmath100 needed for complete vaporisation of a droplet of initial mass @xmath96 at temperature @xmath98 is finite .",

    "this result involves _ a priori _ bounds that are proved in section [ ss : preliminary estimates ] , and where we emphasize the technical difficulties induced by the presence of vaporising droplets .",
    "this allows us to prove in section [ ss : existence of a solution on bounded domains ] the existence of solutions to a system similar to ( [ eq : nondimensional travelling wave ] ) but defined on a bounded domain with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the proof of theorem [ t : existence of travelling waves ] follows in section [ ss : existence of travelling waves ] .",

    "for any given @xmath109 , the corresponding solution @xmath66 is uniquely determined and one can find explicit expressions for all the unknowns , provided the expression for @xmath33 can be explicitly integrated .",
    "the complete characterisation of the system in the hae limit is therefore dictated by the exact value of the velocity @xmath109 of the travelling wave .",
    "the latter is determined thanks to the analysis of the internal combustion layer , also proved in section [ ss : characterisation of the limiting profiles ] :    [ t : rigorous internal layer analysis]let @xmath110 the limiting profile in the high activation energy limit .",
    "the velocity @xmath111 is given by @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the unique velocity such that the droplets finish vaporising exactly at the position of the reaction zone .",
    "this result provides a rigorous justification of the existence of a vaporisation controlled regime , i.e. a regime where @xmath114 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this regime appears when the time for complete vaporisation of the droplets is large enough , precisely when @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is defined by @xmath117 .",

    "an upper estimate of the size of the region where combustion and vaporisation overlap is given in theorem [ t : estimate of the overlapping region ] , followed by an application to the so  called @xmath118law for vaporisation .",
    "finally , section [ s : extensions ] presents some immediate applications of our analysis to the case of polydisperse sprays , fast vaporisation , or radial geometry .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a more detailed exposition of those results .      the pictures below sketch typical profiles for spray travelling waves moving from the right to the left .",

    "our analysis will show that in such a situation , the velocity of the spray flame in the hae limit is equal to that of the purely gaseous flames with same temperature in the burnt gas . in the second case , the vaporisation ends at @xmath132 .",

    "the situation where the vaporisation is very rapid can be modeled by an instantaneous vaporisation ( see @xcite ) leading to a dirac model for the vaporisation term @xmath635 since @xmath93 , vaporisation ends before the reaction zone at @xmath636 .",
    "explicit expressions of the profiles can be found .",
    "all the previous results can be extended in the case of polydisperse sprays , that is the situation where droplets of possibly different sizes are present at a given position . in that case , we need a statistical description of the distribution of size of the droplets as pointed out by williams @xcite .",

    "this polydisperse model admits travelling waves ( see also @xcite ) . in the hae limit",
    ", the regime of the flame is determined by the size of the largest droplet in the fresh gas .",
    "this result is a consequence of the simplicity of our vaporisation law , where no collective effect , nor influence of the density of the gaseous reactant , nor the fine geometry of the system at small scales were taken into account .",

    "we refer the reader to @xcite for more details .",
    "this paper considered the existence of travelling fronts for a simple onedimensionnal thermo - diffusive lean spray flame model .",
    "we proved the existence of travelling waves for a class of combustion and vaporisation laws . as far as qualitative results are concerned , the most important part of the paper is the study of the high activation energy limit for the system .",
    "the limiting problem involves simple explicit profiles and preserves some important features of the dynamics .",
    "extensions of these results to the cases of fast vaporisation , polydisperse sprays or other onedimensionnal geometries were briefly mentionned .",
    "the present work is a first a step towards rigorous derivation of new asymptotic models for spray flames .",
    "however , much remains to be done in order to understand the effect of droplets on the dynamics of the flame structure , as observed by many physicists and experimentalists ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "indeed , our model omits among other things the effects of the latent heat or more complex couplings in the vaporisation law ( see @xcite for such considerations ) .",
    "it would be very interesting to derive some high activation energy models incorporating these effects , in the hope of deriving explicit expressions of the limiting profiles and combustion rates , as well as extinction limits . also , a striking consequence of the high activation energy asymptotics is that droplets _ can not _ cross the flame front in that limit , but may enter the reaction zone only for large but not infinite values of the activation energy",
    ". it would be interesting to derive intermediate asymptotic models providing a precise understanding of the structure and thickening of the combustion region in the presence of vaporising droplets .",
    "ideally , one would hope to recover some of the features of spray flames described in @xcite .",
    "as far as dynamical phenomena are concerned , the problem of the stability of spray flame systems is crucial . the work @xcite presents a mathematical analysis of spray pulsating waves .",
    "see also @xcite . as a second step we have in mind the problem of acoustic instabilities in spray flame systems . in this direction , let us mention the work of clavin an sun @xcite .",
    "their mathematical analysis relies on the possibility of deriving explicit expressions of the solutions to the problem .",
    "this is only possible in certain asymptotic limits .",
    "for that , the authors consider the large activation energy limit for combustion phenomena and assume an instantaneous vaporisation of the droplets . as a consequence ,",
    "both the combustion and the vaporisation zones reduce to infinitely small regions , whose internal layer is analysed .    however , assuming that the vaporisation zone is very small compared to the preheating zone is a very restrictive assumption in many applications where the droplets can spread into the preheating zone , approach the combustion zone , or enter the combustion zone .",
    "we have shown in the present paper that it is possible to analyse such situations where the droplets approach or reach the reaction front , and where the slowly vaporising droplets induce a dramatic change of the combustion rate .",
