    "the past decade has seen a considerable interest and remarkable activity in an area which presently is often referred to as macroscopic quantum mechanics .",
    "specifically , one has been interested in quantum phenomena of macroscopic objects @xcite .",
    "in particular , macroscopic quantum tunneling @xcite ( quantum decay of a metastable state ) , and quantum coherence @xcite have been studied .",
    "soon , it became clear that dissipation has a profound influence on these quantum phenomena .",
    "phenomenologically , dissipation is the consequence of an interaction of the object with an environment which can be thought of as consisting of infinitely many degrees of freedom .",
    "specifically , the environmental degrees of freedom may be chosen to be harmonic oscillators such that we may consider the dissipation as a process where excitations , that are phonons , are emitted and absorbed .",
    "such a model ( caldeira - leggett model ) has been the basis in ref .",
    "@xcite where the influence of dissipation on tunneling has been explored .",
    "as far as quantum coherence is concerned , the most simple system is an object with two different quantum states : it is thought to represent the limiting case of an object in a double - well potential where only the lowest energy states in each of the two wells is relevant and where the tunneling through the separating barrier allows for transitions that probe the coherence .",
    "since a two - state system is equivalent to a spin - one - half problem , this standard system is often referred to by this name . in particular , with the standard coupling to a dissipative environment made of harmonic oscillators , it is called the spin - boson problem which has been studied repeatedly in the past @xcite .",
    "level quantization and resonant tunneling have been observed recently @xcite in a double - well quantum - dot system .",
    "however , the influence of dissipation was not considered in this experiment . on the other hand",
    ", it seems that josephson junctions are also suitable systems for obtaining experimental evidence pertaining to macroscopic quantum effects . in this context ,",
    "evidence for level quantization @xcite , @xcite and for quantum decay @xcite have been obtained ; however , macroscopic quantum coherence has evaded observation so far .",
    "specifically , a josephson junction may be characterized by a current - phase relation @xmath0 where the phase @xmath1 is related to the voltage difference @xmath2 by @xmath3 therefore , the phase of a josephson junction shunted by a capacitance @xmath4 and biased by an external current @xmath5 obeys a classical type of equation of motion @xmath6 with the mass @xmath7 and the potential energy @xmath8\\ , .",
    "\\label{i.5}\\ ] ]    a widely discussed model of a dissipative object is the one where the josephson junction is also shunted by an ohmic resistor @xmath9 . in this case , the classical equation of motion ( [ i.3 ] ) has to be replaced by @xmath10 the model of a dissipative environment according to the above specification has been discussed by caldeira and leggett @xcite .",
    "the potential energy @xmath11 of eq .",
    "( [ i.5 ] ) displays wells at @xmath12 with depth shifted by an amount @xmath13 .",
    "if the wells are sufficiently deep , one needs to concentrate only on transitions between pairs of adjacent wells .",
    "thus , one arrives at the double well problem mentioned above .",
    "the analysis in this paper goes beyond the limiting situation where only the lowest level in each of the two wells is of importance .",
    "roughly , this is realized when the level separation @xmath14 is smaller than or comparable with @xmath15 . in particular , we will concentrate on resonance phenomena which are expected to show up whenever two levels in the adjacent wells happen to cross when the bias current @xmath5 , that is @xmath15 , is varied .    for such values of the bias current",
    ", there appear sharp asymmetric peaks in the current - voltage characteristic of the josephson junction .",
    "this phenomenon has been studied by one of us ( a.s .",
    ", together with a.i .",
    "larkin and yu .",
    "n. ovchinnikov ) @xcite within the standard model in the one - phonon approximation . for bias currents that correspond to crossings of the next and next nearest levels ( e.g. ground state in the left well and the first or second excited state at the right side ) , it is possible to neglect processes in the reverse direction provided that the temperature is sufficiently low",
    "thus , the restriction to a double well system receives additional support .",
    "the transfer of the object from the left to the right potential well is accompanied by the emission of an infinite number of phonons .",
    "therefore , in a recent paper by ovchinnikov and one of us ( a.s . ) @xcite the fact is taken into account that in the resonance region , the contribution of phonons of small energy is important as well as the contribution of resonance phonons with energy equal to the distance between levels in the wells .",
    "the above analysis relies on a perturbation theory for weak dissipation .",
    "moreover , the calculations in that article are rather intricate . therefore , we want to reconsider the problem in a more transparent way and thereby get rid of the restriction of small dissipation .",
    "the model consists of a particle , called `` object'' ( coordinate @xmath16 ) , which is coupled ( in the sense of caldeira and leggett @xcite ) to a `` bath'' of harmonic oscillators ( coordinates @xmath17 ) .",
    "we shall use the conventions @xmath18 for the bath oscillators and @xmath19 for the indices of all coordinates in the model .",
    "the double - well potential is approximated by two parabolas about the minima of the two wells as it is depicted in fig .",
    "[ general ] .",
    "the phase @xmath1 of the josephson contact then corresponds to the object coordinate @xmath16 of the model , and the voltage @xmath2 is related to the tunneling rate @xmath20 by @xmath21 . as it has already been remarked , the current @xmath5 is proportional to the bias @xmath15 of the two wells .",
    "thus , calculating the transition rate for different values of the bias @xmath15 is equivalent to the determination of the i - v characteristics .",
    "specifically , we want to write the hamiltonian of the model in the form @xmath22 the states for the two situations `` object in the left well'' and `` object in the right well'' will be denoted by @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "if one projects onto the eigenstates @xmath25 of the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator and takes into account the shift of the wells , one arrives at the following decomposition ( @xmath26 ) : @xmath27    the situations `` object on the left'' and `` object on the right'' differ only by the shift and the bias of the wells .",
    "therefore , one can find a unified representation by noting that @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the eigenstates @xmath30 are defined by the relations @xmath31 thus , it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ ii.2 ] ) and ( [ ii.3 ] ) , respectively , that @xmath32 where we have used the shift property of the momentum operator @xmath33 .",
    "the coupling of the two wells is taken into account by means of a tunneling hamiltonian @xmath34 which we represent in the form @xmath35 using again the momentum operator , one can write @xmath36 from this , we conclude that @xmath37",
    "the net transition rate from the left well to the right one is then in second order perturbation theory given by @xmath38\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath40-function may be written in fourier representation , and the fact that the @xmath41 are eigenenergies of @xmath42 serves us to incorporate the energy conservation into heisenberg time - dependent operators @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath44    then , collecting our results from eqs .",
    "( [ ii.4 ] ) , ( [ ii.5 ] ) , ( [ ii.6 ] ) , and ( [ iii.0 ] ) , we arrive at the expression @xmath45 let us now use the relation @xmath46 which holds for @xmath47 when @xmath48 is the time - ordering operator and for @xmath49 when the anti time - ordering is used . if we define @xmath50 , we can write the following result for the transition rate : @xmath51      \\bigg\\rangle\\ , . \\label{iii.res}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we are now in the position to make use of the fact that the hamiltonian is quadratic in all coordinates so that we can evaluate exactly @xmath52 by comparison with the last two lines in eq .",
    "( [ iii.res ] ) , the function @xmath53 is given by @xmath54\\nonumber\\\\     & & + m(r - r ' ) \\delta'(t'-t )     + m(\\overline{r}-\\overline{r } ' ) \\delta'(t')\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath55 is meant to represent the step function .",
    "the derivatives of the @xmath40-function arise from a partial integration of terms containing @xmath56 .",
    "note , that these act only on the coordinates but not on the step functions which arise due to the time ordering .    moreover , the degrees of freedom of the bath can be integrated out in the usual way @xcite leading to a dissipative influence on the object .",
    "one is then lead to the following form of the fourier transform of @xmath57 : @xmath58 + i\\eta\\omega\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we will use a spectral density @xmath59 , @xmath60 for the bath oscillators ( see also @xcite and appendix [ app : green ] ) .    from eqs .",
    "( [ iii.res ] ) and ( [ iii.quad ] ) one can conclude that the integrations with respect to @xmath61 can be done exactly as only gaussian integrals are involved ( note , that the eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator are gaussian functions and derivatives of these , respectively ) .",
    "therefore , for given @xmath62 , one has to perform a 6-dimensional gaussian integral .",
    "the only difficulty lies in the @xmath63-integration , which we have done numerically .",
    "note furthermore , that without dissipation ( i.e. @xmath64 ) the tunneling current @xmath20 is independent of the shift @xmath65 , as one can show explicitly .",
    "specifically , let us restrict ourselves to the case of zero temperature where only the lowest level of the left well is expected to contribute to the transition rate .",
    "moreover , we will assume that the bias @xmath66 and that the dissipation leads only to a moderate broadening of the energy levels of the oscillator .",
    "then , one needs to consider only the levels @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the calculation of the transition rate for this case is deferred to appendix [ app : six ] .",
    "we want to mention , however , that the cutoff frequency @xmath69 of the bath spectrum is important to avoid a divergency of @xmath70 for @xmath71 . in fig .",
    "[ trans ] , we show the results for the transition rate calculated for different values of the dissipation @xmath72 and the shift @xmath65 . there ,",
    "we have used dimensionless variables which means that the frequencies and lengths were normalized to their characteristic scales @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "the dimensionless parameters are then given by @xmath75 for the shift and @xmath76 for the viscosity .    in a typical experimental situation , one has @xmath77 for the josephson current and @xmath78 for the capacity .",
    "thus , we have @xmath79 , which means that @xmath80 .",
    "the dimensionless viscosity is given by @xmath81 .",
    "note , however , that the transition rate to be observed experimentally will be very small due to the exponentially small factor @xmath82 @xcite .    for small values of the dissipation or rather of @xmath83 , the perturbation theory @xcite yields the expression @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "when normalized to the same value of the peak maximum , the curves calculated from the above formula ( [ os ] ) are nearly identical with those we obtained from our theory ( cf .",
    "fig . [ cmp ] ) .",
    "the different normalization stems from @xcite the way the divergencies were removed in @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have studied the transition rate in a double - well system under the influence of a dissipative environment .",
    "the rate shows asymmetric peaks when the levels of the wells approach each other .",
    "thus , we have calculated the i - v characteristics of a josephson junction shunted by an ohmic resistor for resonance conditions .",
    "we have modeled the system by two parabolic potentials coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators .",
    "the coupling of the wells has been realized by a tunneling hamiltonian .",
    "moreover , the analysis has taken into account that the transfer of the object between the wells is a multiphonon process .",
    "in addition , our calculation has the advantage that the bath coordinates do not appear explicitly any more when the thermal average is taken .    the authors would like to thank a.i .",
    "larkin and yu.n .",
