    "hera - b @xcite was a fixed target experiment ( fig .  [ hbdet ] ) at the hera storage ring at desy in hamburg .",
    "the experiment used 920 gev protons from the beam halo and a set of eight thin ribbons , of different materials , as targets .",
    "the interaction rate was adjusted by moving the targets in or out of the beam halo @xcite .",
    "the experiment utilized a forward spectrometer capable of measuring interaction rates up to 40 mhz .",
    "the spectrometer consisted of a dipole magnet , a vertex detector @xcite upstream and a main tracking system downstream of the magnet @xcite .",
    "particle identification was performed by a ring imaging erenkov ( rich ) detector @xcite , an electromagnetic calorimeter @xcite and a muon detector system @xcite .",
    "in addition , the experiment included a sophisticated hardware trigger for lepton track pairs to record leptonic decays of @xmath0 particles .",
    "the large acceptance of the spectrometer coupled with high - granularity particle identification devices and a precision vertex detector allowed for detailed studies of multi - particle final states @xcite-@xcite . by using targets of different materials ,",
    "hera - b was also able to study the dependence of various properties of proton - nucleus interactions as a function of atomic number .",
    "the identification of pions , kaons and protons was performed by the rich detector @xcite .",
    "the hera - b rich used atmospheric pressure @xmath1 as erenkov radiator ( n=1.00137 ) .",
    "the focusing of erenkov light was achieved with two spherical mirrors , tilted by @xmath2 in opposite directions ( fig .",
    "[ hbdet ] ) .",
    "two planar mirrors then reflected the light to photon detectors at the top and bottom of the vessel containing the radiator gas . for the detection of erenkov photons multi anode pmts ( hamamatsu r5900 ) were used .",
    "the inner part of the photon detector surface was equipped with 16-channel pmts ( 16 x 4 mm x 4 mm ) and the outer region with coarser granularity had 4-channel pmts ( 4 x 8 mm x 8 mm ) . to overcome the loss of photons due to inactive space between pmt photocathodes , a demagnifying lens system @xcite",
    "was placed in front of each pmt .",
    "the particle identification capabilities of a rich counter are determined by the resolution of the measured erenkov angle , which is given by the two main parameters of a rich counter , the erenkov angle resolution due to a single photon and the number of detected photons per erenkov ring . the measured average number of detected photons for particles approaching the speed of light amounts to 33 .",
    "it is in good agreement with the value expected from the data available on the quantum efficiency , mirror reflectivity , and transmissions of the vessel window and of the optical system @xcite .",
    "the main contributions to the single photon resolution ( r.m.s . ) come from the photon detector granularity ( 0.50  mrad and 0.93  mrad for the regions covered by finer and coarser granularity pmts respectively ) and the dispersion in the radiator medium ( 0.33  mrad ) .",
    "the optical error ( 0.25  mrad ) includes contributions from spherical aberration , mirror quality , and mirror alignment .",
    "the contribution of multiple scattering in the rich counter ( @xmath3 ) becomes important at low momenta .",
    "the resulting expected single photon resolution , @xmath4 and @xmath5 for the regions covered by the two types of pmts , does not include the contribution from the uncertainty in the track direction , which is given by other components of the hera - b detector .    in order to reach and maintain the optimal performance of the rich counter , elaborate alignment and calibration methods have to be used .",
    "for the optical system of the hera - b rich , a calibration method was used which is based on a procedure originally developed on simulated data @xcite .",
    "the main imaging device of the hera - b rich is a spherical mirror placed inside the radiator vessel with the center of the sphere near the target and a radius of curvature of 11.4  m. the mirror , a 6  m by 4  m rectangular cutout from the sphere , consists of 80 full or partial hexagons ( see fig .",
    "[ mirror - tiling ] ) . to achieve a focal surface outside of the main particle flux ( @xmath6160 mrad vertically ) , the mirror is split horizontally , and both halves are tilted by 9@xmath7 away from the beam - line .",
    "a set of two planar mirrors , composed of 18 rectangular elements each , translates the focal surface to the photon detector area above and below the radiator vessel ( see fig .  [ hbdet ] ) .",
    "the 116 mirror segments are mounted on rigid , low mass support structures inside the radiator volume and can be individually adjusted by stepper motors from the outside .",
    "all mirrors were first aligned after installation by surveying them inside the vessel . during the data taking periods ,",
    "the mirror system was calibrated by making use of recorded events . by comparing the charged particle track direction , obtained from the erenkov rings due to a particular spherical - planar mirror pair , to the track direction obtained from other detectors of hera - b , the calibration parameters of individual mirror segments , as well as those of the entire rich counter , could be extracted . for this purpose ,",
    "various data sets have been used . with",
    "the magnetic field turned off , the direction of the straight tracks was accurately given by the target wire position and the centroid of the cluster in the electromagnetic calorimeter . with",
    "the magnetic field turned on , the tracks were determined by the tracking system . in order to reduce the uncertainty in track direction due to multiple coulomb scattering , only those tracks belonging to particles with energy above 5 gev were used .",
    "assume that one or both mirrors in a particular spherical - planar mirror pair are not well aligned .",
    "in such a case , the measured erenkov ring , due to photons reflected on that pair , will be displaced relative to the direction of the charged particle , which is taken to be reflected on ideal mirror positions . for small displacements",
    "@xmath8 , the azimuthal dependence of erenkov angle for photons on a given ring is parameterized as ( fig .  [ meth - scheme ] ) : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the nominal value of the erenkov angle . the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 roughly correspond to rotations of the mirrors around vertical and horizontal axes . a rotation of a spherical mirror segment by @xmath13 around the vertical and horizontal axes results in @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , while the same rotation of the planar mirror results in @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( see fig .  [ align_unamb ] )",
    "the method obviously relies on accumulating a sufficient number of photons , which have been reflected on a particular spherical - planar mirror pair . for each track - photon pair",
    ", the photon has been traced from two points on the charged particle track to the photon hit position ( fig .",
    "[ align_unamb ] ) .",
    "the first point is the particle entry into the radiator , the second is directly in front of the spherical mirror .",
    "if both rays at a given azimuthal angle are reflected from the same spherical - planar mirror pair , such a photon hit is taken as a valid data point on the erenkov ring , relevant for that mirror pair .",
    "in other words , a photon hit is valid for our analysis if the corresponding photon would have been reflected from the same spherical - planar mirror pair , regardless of the point on the charged particle trajectory from which it might have originated . in the following we refer to such hits as calibration hits .",
    "figure  [ align_thc_vs_phi_data ] shows the distribution of such hits for two particular combinations of a spherical and two planar mirrors .",
    "the two - dimensional histograms on the left hand side of the figure represent the number of calibration hits as a function of erenkov angle difference @xmath18 and azimuthal angle @xmath19 . the difference to the nominal erenkov angle @xmath20 of a pion at the measured momentum @xmath21",
    "is chosen in order to suppress the momentum dependence ; the pion hypothesis is chosen since the majority of tracks correspond to pions .",
    "an accumulation of hits at about @xmath22 can be seen , with some modulation dependent on azimuthal angle @xmath23 . for each of 50 slices in @xmath23 ,",
    "the distribution was fitted with a gaussian for the peak and a polynomial background ( fig .",
    "[ align_fit_slice ] ) .",
    "the erenkov peak position as a function of azimuthal angle ( right hand side of fig .",
    "[ align_thc_vs_phi_data ] ) is then fitted with the function @xmath24 , and the rotation angles @xmath25 and @xmath26 are obtained for the given mirror pair is a constant to account for a possible bias in the erenkov angle measurement . ] .",
    "close to mirror boundaries , parts of a ring could be shared by different combinations of spherical and planar mirrors , which permits relative calibration of adjacent mirrors .",
    "the measured displacement @xmath27 ) for a pair of mirrors is equal to the sum of unknown contributions from the corresponding spherical and planar mirror segments @xmath28 and @xmath29 : @xmath30 @xmath31 this represents a system of @xmath32 linear equations for the @xmath33 unknown parameters , where @xmath34 is the number of all measured segment combinations @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the number of mirror segments . as any given mirror segment contributes to more than one combination ,",
    "there are more equations than there are unknowns . arranging the measured @xmath37 and @xmath38 into vectors @xmath39 and @xmath40 , with dimensions equal to @xmath34 ,",
    "the system of equations may be written for each of the detector halves as @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the unknown contributions to the rotation @xmath27 ) of a particular mirror segment .",
    "note that the matrix @xmath44 is of a particular simple form ; in a given row it only has 1 at two places ( given by the indices of the spherical and planar segments , eqs .",
    "[ eq2 ] and [ eq3 ] ) , and is otherwise equal to zero .",
    "note that we have to add an additional condition to fully determine the system : if all spherical mirrors are turned by @xmath13 , and all planar mirrors by @xmath45 , one arrives at the same ring displacements ( vectors @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) . rather than fixing the displacement of one mirror in the lower and one in the upper half to zero ( one of the possibilities ) , we require of the solution to minimize the necessary mirror readjustments , @xmath46 the first sum in each of the equations runs over all",
    "spherical mirror segments and the second over all planar ones in a given detector half .",
    "we include these two equations in the system of equations [ eq4 ] , and get two systems with @xmath47 equations , @xmath48 where @xmath49 replaces @xmath50 to account for the additional equation .",
    "the systems of equations , eq .",
    "[ eq5.1 ] , are solved by requiring that the properly weighted sum of squares of deviations of the left hand side from the right hand side for each of the two systems is minimal , @xmath51 where the terms are weighted by the inverse square of the error @xmath52 in the measurement , a value of @xmath53  mrad was assumed ; no influence was found when this value was varied . ] of @xmath54 . here",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath54 denote either @xmath42 and @xmath39 or @xmath43 and @xmath40 . the resulting linear system , @xmath56 is readily solved , @xmath57 here we have defined a new matrix @xmath58 which is symmetric , so that its inverse @xmath59 is easy to calculate .",
    "the resulting errors on @xmath60 are given by @xmath61      having solved the system of equations for angular displacements of individual mirror segments , the quality of the new alignment is checked on the data , by examining the erenkov angle resolution before and after applying the new calibration parameters , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ align_thc_data ] ; the improvement in resolution is clearly visible .    to check the resulting alignment of the optical system",
    ", we have reanalyzed the data after having applied the calculated corrections .",
    "as expected , the new corrections were consistent with zero .    to study possible systematic effects ,",
    "we have investigated different data sets , recorded under different conditions .",
    "we found good agreement of the results with two different gas radiators , when freon ( @xmath66=52 mrad ) was replaced with nitrogen ( @xmath66=25 mrad ) .",
    "a similar analysis was also performed on the data recorded without magnetic field .",
    "again the analysis yielded results that are consistent with the values deduced from the data with magnetic field .",
    "we also found that the alignment parameters did not change over extended periods of time , which testifies to stable mirror positions .",
    "possible systematic effects were also checked by using monte carlo generated events , where all mirror segments were assumed to be perfectly aligned .",
    "although the resulting parameters are all consistent with zero , small systematic effects at the level of 0.1  mrad could not be excluded due to limited statistics .",
    "a method was developed for determination of the alignment of the rich counter relative to other parts of the spectrometer , either the system of tracking chambers or the electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "the method was tested on various sets of real data , recorded with and without magnetic field , as well as on simulated data . by applying alignment corrections for each mirror segment as derived by this method , a significant improvement in the resolution of the erenkov angle measurement could be obtained .",
    "the hera - b experiment finished data taking in spring 2003 . during its five years of operation",
    ", the hera - b rich has proved reliability and stability of all its components and especially of the multi anode pmts .",
    "the low noise , high rate capability and excellent long term stability of these devices enabled excellent operation in the hostile environment of a hadron machine .",
    "the hera - b rich identifies pions , kaons and protons essentially in the entire kinematic range of the hera - b experiment with the identification efficiencies as large as 90% and mis - identification probability at the 1% level  @xcite .",
    "with kaon and proton identification the combinatorial background is in some cases reduced by more than 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "several physics analyses would not have been possible without the excellent performance of the rich particle identification system  @xcite ."
