    "in the success of slow - roll inflation , the sufficient flat potential for the inflaton , which is the inflation driving scalar field , is required . however , it is not so easy to construct a model of inflation where the corresponding scalar field has a very flat potential in the framework of supergravity .",
    "usually , the flatness of the potential is expressed as @xmath2 in terms of the slow roll parameters , where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the inflaton and @xmath3 is the reduced planck mass . in the case that the vacuum energy is dominated by the @xmath4-term during the inflation , supergravity effects produce the soft mass of inflaton field whose magnitude is the same order of @xmath5 and spoil the flatness of potential . in other words ,",
    "such large inflaton mass gives @xmath6 and violates the slow roll condition , which is often referred to as the @xmath1 problem .",
    "from this point of view , the @xmath0-term inflation is one of attractive inflation scenarios within the framework of supersymmetric models @xcite ,- term . ] because the inflaton does not acquire the mass squared term of the order of @xmath7 and the flatness of the potential is preserved . in the @xmath0-term inflation scenario , fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) term is dominant during the inflation and this vacuum energy causes the accelerating expansion .",
    "the fi term comes from the anomalous @xmath8 symmetry .",
    "in fact , most of 4d string models have anomalous @xmath8 symmetry for both heterotic models @xcite and type i models @xcite .",
    "these anomalies can be cancelled by the green - schwarz mechanism , where certain fields transform non - trivially under anomalous @xmath8 symmetries @xcite .",
    "such role is played by the dilaton field @xmath9 in heterotic models and the twisted moduli fields @xmath10 in type i models . that generates the fi term .",
    "thus , the @xmath0-term inflation seems possible to be realized in string models .    however , there are difficulties in the realization of the @xmath0-term inflation based on heterotic models .",
    "the first problem is the energy scale of inflation .",
    "the magnitude of the fi term is given as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the gauge coupling and @xmath13 is a model dependent constant of the order of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "( [ hetero - xi ] ) reads @xmath15 . on the other hand",
    ", the cmb anisotropy requires @xmath16 gev .",
    "we find that the theoretical prediction is too larger to meet the observational estimation .",
    "this inconsistency is still a serious problem , although several studies to construct a model with effectively suppressed fi terms have been done in heterotic models @xcite .",
    "the second problem is due to the dilaton dependence of the fi term and the anomalous @xmath8 gauge coupling .",
    "the presence of the dilaton @xmath9 and several types of moduli fields is one of important features in superstring theory .",
    "vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of these fields determine the magnitudes of all the couplings , e.g. gauge couplings and yukawa couplings .",
    "the dilaton field prevents the realization of @xmath0-term inflation . since @xmath17 , the @xmath0-term scalar potential , @xmath18 , is in proportion to @xmath19 .",
    "hence the dilaton rolls down the potential to the infinity , @xmath20 , and the @xmath0-term potential energy goes to zero , @xmath21 .",
    "this phenomenon is the same as the dilaton runaway problem in generic string models and such runaway behavior of the dilaton and moduli fields prevents a viable inflation @xcite .",
    "even if we adopt type i models rather than heterotic models , the fi term is dependent on the field which plays a role in the green - schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism for the anomalous @xmath8 .",
    "hence , if these fields run away , the @xmath0-term inflation can not occur in 4d string models .",
    "in this paper we study behavior of dilaton and moduli fields in the @xmath0-term inflation scenario with the above two problems in mind .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to explore a way to avoid these problems at the same time .",
    "actually , studies on the runaway problem have been done for heterotic models in refs .",
    "now , in particular , we will consider type i string - inspired models .",
    "the @xmath0-term inflation in type i inspired model has been studied in ref.@xcite and it was shown that the magnitude of fi - term is reducible to a desired value .",
    "this result arise from the facts that the fi - term is determined by the expectation value of the twisted moduli and the string scale @xmath22 is independent of the planck scale @xmath3 @xcite in type i string models .",
    "in fact , the twisted moduli field plays a role in the green - schwarz anomaly cancellation in 4d type i string models .",
    "however , in ref.@xcite the stabilization of the twisted moduli and the runway problem have not been discussed .",
    "these issues might be not trivial .",
    "indeed , stabilization of the twisted moduli fields was studied and different aspects from those of the dilaton field was revealed @xcite . as we will show , the twisted moduli field can not stabilize with non - vanishing vacuum energy in only @xmath0-term potential and any vacuum energy driving inflation does not appear , unless we assume a specific khler potential . therefore , stabilization of the twisted moduli is also an important issue for the inflation in type i models .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we review briefly the @xmath0-term inflation . in section 3 , we study behavior of dilaton and twisted moduli fields .",
    "it will be shown that the twisted moduli field is stabilized during the inflation . in section 4 ,",
    "dynamics of the inflaton and dilaton fields are studied , and we will derive constraints on parameters in our models .",
    "section 5 is devoted to conclusions and discussions .",
    "here we give a brief review on the @xmath0-term inflation @xcite .",
    "we consider the n=1 supersymmetric model with @xmath8 gauge symmetry and the non - vanishing fi term @xmath23 .",
    "the model includes three matter fields @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the fields @xmath25 have @xmath8 charges @xmath26 while @xmath24 has no @xmath8 charge .",
    "the @xmath8 @xmath0-term is written as @xmath27 hereafter we take the charge assignment such that @xmath28 .",
    "suppose that the following superpotential , @xmath29 then , the scalar potential is written as @xmath30 the true vacuum of this potential corresponds to @xmath31 and supersymmetry ( susy ) is not broken .    for a value of @xmath24 fixed ,",
    "we analyze the minimum of @xmath32 .",
    "we define @xmath33 for @xmath34 , the minimum corresponds to @xmath35 in this case , the vacuum energy is obtained as @xmath36 and the radial part of @xmath24 is identified with the inflaton .",
    "although the mass of @xmath24 vanishes at the tree - level , since the supersymmetry breaking by the non - vanishing @xmath0-term generates the mass difference between the masses of @xmath25 , @xmath37 and the masses of those fermionic partners , then the one - loop effective potential is given as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the renormalization scale .",
    "that generates the mass term of @xmath24 and the potential is slightly lifted .",
    "then , the inflaton slowly rolls down the potential . from the following equation ,",
    "@xmath40 we find that the slow roll condition is violated @xmath41 when the inflaton reach at @xmath42 and the inflation ends .",
    "we have reviewed on the simplest @xmath0-term inflation model . however , as noted in introduction , the magnitude of fi term @xmath23 in such simplest model is required to be much smaller than the values of @xmath23 derived from 4d heterotic models . ref .",
    "@xcite has proposed the mechanism in heterotic models to reduce effectively the fi term compared with its original value .",
    "here we also give a brief review on such models . instead of the single field @xmath24 , we consider two fields @xmath43 .",
    "generic string models have several @xmath44 symmetries .",
    "some of them are anomalous and others are anomaly - free . in ref .",
    "@xcite 4d heterotic models were studied and the fi term was considered for only one of @xmath8 symmetries .",
    "that is because only one @xmath8 symmetry can be anomalous in a 4d heterotic model .",
    "however , we will study inflation models inspired by type i string models , where two or more @xmath8 symmetries can be anomalous .",
    "thus , here we extend the model of ref .",
    "@xcite into the case with many fi terms , @xmath45 , while @xmath46 for anomaly - free @xmath44 .",
    "suppose that @xmath43 have @xmath44 charges @xmath47 .",
    "then the @xmath0-term is written as @xmath48 where the ellipsis denotes contributions due to other chiral matter fields .",
    "we consider large field values for @xmath43 , @xmath49 as before and assume that the other fields gain mass terms , e.g. @xmath50 then , the matter fields other than @xmath43 vanish for @xmath43 , @xmath49 , and the @xmath0-term is dominated by @xmath43 . in this case , the scalar potential is written as @xmath51 the direction @xmath52 corresponds to the inflaton .",
    "the minimum of @xmath53 is obtained as @xmath54 for @xmath55 in a certain situation ( maybe with fine - tuning ) , this vacuum energy @xmath56 becomes much smaller than @xmath57 .",
    "furthermore , in ref . @xcite more fields @xmath58 relevant to the inflaton have been introduced and in such case an effective value of fi term can be reduced .",
    "in this section we study behavior of dilaton and twisted moduli fields in type i string - inspired @xmath0-term inflation model .",
    "we consider the case that the anomalous @xmath8 is originated from the @xmath59 brane . in this case",
    "the gauge kinetic function is obtained as @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a model - dependent constant and we define @xmath62 .",
    "the corresponding gauge coupling @xmath63 is obtained as @xmath64 .",
    "the khler potential of the dilaton filed @xmath9 is written as @xmath65 on the other hand , the khler potential of the twisted moduli field @xmath66 is not clear . for small values of @xmath10 , it can be expanded as @xcite @xmath67 however , the reliability of this form is not clear for large values of @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath68 .    the twisted moduli field plays a role in the 4d green - schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism , and the fi term is obtained as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a model - dependent constant . thus the @xmath0-term scalar potential is obtained during the inflation , @xmath71 ^ 2 } { s + \\bar s + \\tilde \\sigma ( m + \\bar m ) } .",
    "\\label{vd - d9}\\ ] ]    first , let us study behavior of @xmath9 during the inflation .",
    "if @xmath9 run away into infinity , the @xmath0-term inflation can not succeed . here , we introduce the canonically normalized dilaton field @xmath72 , which is defined as @xmath73 the first and second derivatives of @xmath53 by @xmath72 are obtained as @xmath74 suppose the twisted moduli @xmath10 is stabilized somehow such that @xmath75 .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath76 that is , the slow roll condition is satisfied for the dilaton field and it does not run away . note that this result is independent of the form of @xmath66 .    we have considered the case that the @xmath8 gauge multiplet is originated from the @xmath59 brane .",
    "we can easily extend the above analysis into another case .",
    "for example , when the @xmath8 gauge multiplet is originated from the @xmath77 brane wrapping a 2d torus of the 6d compact space . in this case",
    ", the gauge kinetic function is obtained as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the moduli field whose vev determines the volume of the 2d torus .",
    "its khler potential is the same as the dilaton field , i.e. , @xmath80 hence , the @xmath0-term scalar potential during the @xmath0-term inflation is written as @xmath71 ^ 2 } { t_i + \\bar t_i + \\tilde \\sigma ( m + \\bar m ) } .\\ ] ] in a similar way to the dilaton field , the moduli field @xmath79 does not run away if @xmath10 is stabilized such that @xmath81 .",
    "next , we study the stabilization of @xmath10 in the model with @xmath53 , eq .",
    "( [ vd - d9 ] ) , that @xmath8 is originated from the @xmath59 brane . for @xmath75 ,",
    "the potential reduces to @xmath82 ^ 2 } { \\tilde \\sigma ( m + \\bar m ) } .\\ ] ] unfortunately , only the term @xmath53 does not stabilize the twisted moduli @xmath10 at a finite value with non - vanishing vacuum energy , unless we choose a special form of @xmath66 .",
    "in fact , the minimum in this potential is located at @xmath83 and @xmath84 for the khler potential , @xmath85 .",
    "hence , another term is necessary for stabilization of @xmath10 such that the @xmath0-term inflation can be realized .",
    "we assume that gaugino condensation of another non - abelian gauge group generates the following non - perturbative superpotential , @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 is the one - loop beta - function coefficient of the gauge coupling . in general , the constant @xmath89 is different from @xmath61 .",
    "anyway one needs a stabilization mechanism of @xmath9 as well as @xmath10 in the true vacuum after the inflation ends .",
    "it is the usual approach to stabilize @xmath9 by this type of non - perturbative superpotential .",
    "thus , it is natural to assume the above superpotential . for stabilization of @xmath9 in the true vacuum ,",
    "double or more gaugino condensations are often used in the so - called race - track model . here",
    ", for simplicity , we consider the case that only the single gaugino condensation potential is dominant during the inflation . as we did in estimation of @xmath53",
    ", we assume @xmath90 during inflation , that is , we have @xmath91 . in this case , the scalar potential in the global susy is written as @xmath92 where @xmath93 .",
    "we need the explicit form of @xmath66 to discuss the stabilization of @xmath10 . here and hereafter",
    "we take @xmath94 the stationary condition @xmath95 is satisfied by @xmath96 where @xmath97 denotes the expectation value during inflation . if the effective mass squared during inflation , @xmath98 is enough larger than @xmath7 around this stationary point , the twisted moduli can be stabilized .",
    "the condition is satisfied in the present model because of @xmath99 and @xmath100 , as we will see soon .",
    "note that the key - point for stabilization is the polynomial form of the khler potential , in particular the canonical form .",
    "when we consider additional higher terms @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) in the khler potential , we obtain qualitatively similar result for stabilization .",
    "however , if the twisted moduli field has the logarithmic form of khler potential , this type of stabilization can not be realized .",
    "now let us estimate @xmath103 .",
    "if @xmath104 , we estimate @xmath105 , because of @xmath106 . for such small value of @xmath107 , the factor @xmath108 inside of the logarithmic function enlarges @xmath103 by a factor of @xmath109",
    "also , the gs coefficient @xmath70 may enlarge @xmath103 by a few factor for @xmath110 .",
    "then we can estimate @xmath111 fig .",
    "1 shows @xmath32 against @xmath112 for @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the form of khler potential , eq.([m , kahler ] ) is not reliable for a large value of @xmath103 , i.e. @xmath115 . from this point ,",
    "the above result that @xmath10 is stabilized as a small value is favorable .",
    "another nice point of the result is that the stabilized value satisfies @xmath116 when the value inside of the logarithmic function is large .",
    "note that @xmath4-term and @xmath0-term parts in the scalar potential satisfy @xmath117 eqs.([m_inf ] ) and ( [ dtof ] ) imply the following inequality , @xmath118 that is , with this stabilized value of @xmath103 the @xmath0-term scalar potential is dominant .",
    "that allows to realize the @xmath0-term inflation .",
    "therefore , the vacuum energy during inflation is estimated as @xmath119    in explicit type i string models through type iib orientifold construction , the gs coefficient @xmath70 is calculated in the unit of @xmath22 as @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "it is not completely clear what is a natural value of @xmath70 from the viewpoint of generic type i models except type iib construction .",
    "furthermore , as reviewed in the previous section , the original value of the fi term appears as the inflation vacuum energy in the simplest model , but it can be effectively reduced in the models with more fields and @xmath8 symmetries . as another remark , if @xmath121 is suppressed by any mechanism , the stabilized value @xmath122 becomes small like @xmath123 .",
    "now let us discuss the dynamics in this inflation model .",
    "the relevant potential including one - loop correction during inflaton is given by @xmath124 .",
    "\\label{potential}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the @xmath4-term contribution is negligibly smaller than the @xmath0-term in potential , as already mentioned . on the other hand",
    ", one should notice that the stabilization of twisted moduli is achieved by the @xmath4-term potential and we can replace @xmath125 with @xmath126 .",
    "furthermore , hereafter we will consider only the region , @xmath127 in order to avoid the runway motion of the dilaton and obtain a successful inflation . in this sence",
    ", the initial value problem of the dilaton , why the dilaton takes such a initial value , remains unsolved .    from @xmath128",
    "we find that when the inflaton , @xmath24 , .",
    "] reaches at the critical point , @xmath129 , where @xmath130 the slow roll condition is violated . on the other hand , @xmath131 is expressed as @xmath132 hence , if the inequality @xmath133 hold , inflationary expansion terminates when inflaton reaches at @xmath129 rather than @xmath131 .",
    "this inequality holds for @xmath134",
    ".    then the equations of motion for the homogeneous part of scalar fields , @xmath24 and @xmath72 , are respectively given by @xmath135 and @xmath136 where we ignored the dilaton dependence in the radiative correction part because of the weakness of the dependence .",
    "the solutions under the slow roll approximation are @xmath137 with @xmath138 and @xmath139 , where @xmath140 denotes the time of the end of the inflation . by using the definition of the number of @xmath141-folds @xmath142 , eq.([solution - phi ] )",
    "is rewritten as @xmath143 since the l.h.s .",
    "must be less than the order of @xmath144 , we find that @xmath145 for the present horizon scale .",
    "similarly , from eq.([solution - x ] ) we obtain @xmath146 we unfortunately found the somewhat large field value region , @xmath147 , is used in this inflation model .",
    "this is the undesirable feature in this model .",
    "here we estimate the following quantity @xmath148 where we adopted @xmath129 as @xmath149 and suppose @xmath150 .",
    "thus we find that the ratio of kinetic energies of these scalar fields takes a value of @xmath151 , because the final part in this expression is almost unity during the inflation .",
    "next , we turn to the density perturbation generated by this inflation model .",
    "the wmap data shows that the adiabatic fluctuation is favored @xcite . on the other hand , in general , a inflation model which contains several evolving scalar fields produces also the isocurvature fluctuation .",
    "accordingly , we estimate the contribution from the isocurvature mode and confirm this model to be consistent with the observations . the perturbed einstein equation in fourier",

    "furthermore , as we already mentioned , since the dilaton dependence in the radiative correction part is negligible , the potential , eq.([potential ] ) , seems a separated form @xmath170 . since @xmath171 in this case , eqs.([x - sol ] ) and ( [ phi - sol ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath172 then , the curvature perturbation is expressed as @xmath173 from @xmath174 , we find the first term is much larger than the second term and the primary contribution to the density perturbation comes from the adiabatic fluctuation generated by the inflaton .",
    "hence , we find that the density perturbation in this inflation model is almost adiabatic with small isocurvature fluctuations .    here",
    "we shall introduce the so - called bardeen parameter which is defined by @xmath175 which is conserved in the superhorizon scale , @xmath176 , if the fluctuation is adiabatic @xcite . here",
    "@xmath177 denotes the ratio of pressure to energy density .",
    "however , the present model contains two slow - rolling scalar fields and may produce the isocurvature fluctuation . in this case , the time variation of @xmath178 is caused by the isocurvature fluctuation and the bardeen parameter is no logner conserved quantity on superhorizon scales .",
    "indeed , the time variation of @xmath178 is expressed as @xmath179 where @xmath180 and the following quantity @xmath181 represents the amplitude of an entropy perturbation . in the case",
    "that the universe is filled with two component scalar fields @xmath155 , eq.([zeta - dot ] ) is rewritten as @xcite @xmath182 in a single field inflation model , either @xmath183 or @xmath184 goes to zero and the second term in r.h.s of eq.([zeta - dot-2 ] ) vanishes .",
    "thus , @xmath178 becomes the conserved quantity on superhorizon scales in that case .",
    "however , we need take the variation of @xmath178 into account , because there are two evolving scalar fields in the present model .",

    "the amplitude of curvature perturbation is rewritten as @xmath192 and we obtain the constraint on the model parameters @xmath193 for the present horizon scale . for the gs coefficient @xmath70 , a suppressed value is required like the heterotic case .",
    "explicit models through type iib orientifold construction seem to derive @xmath194 @xcite .",
    "anyway , the gs coefficient @xmath70 is model - dependent .",
    "if we find the model that @xmath70 is small enough like @xmath195 , the string scale can be almost comparable with @xmath3 or slightly smaller .",
    "otherwise , if the original fi terms are not small enough , we would need the mechanism to reduce the effective fi term as mentioned in section 2 or a lower string scale .",
    "on the other hand , the spectrum of gravitational wave perturbation produced by the inflation is given by @xmath196 and its observational results show @xmath197 .",
    "this constraint is expressed as @xmath198 in term of the potential .",
    "therefore we obtain @xmath199 by combining eqs.([scalar - constr ] ) and ( [ tensor - constr ] ) , we obtain @xmath200 . that can be satisfied by a stabilized value ( [ value - m ] ) of @xmath201 , e.g. @xmath202 for @xmath150 .",
    "finally we discuss the evolution of the universe after inflation .",
    "the relevant potential after inflation is given by latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } v & = & \\mathrm{(gaugino\\,~ condensation\\,~ potential ) } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\lambda^2 |x|^2|\\phi_-|^2 + \\frac{(\\delta_{gs}k'(m,\\bar m ) -    the inflation , scalar fields , @xmath24 and @xmath204 oscillate around their corresponding minimum @xmath205 and @xmath206 , respectively .",
    "here we should notice that @xmath23 is function of the twisted moduli @xmath10 and still a time variant in the reheating stage , because the twisted moduli does not yet reach at the true vacuum at this moment .",
    "this is a feature which the simplest model of @xmath0-term inflation does not possess .",
    "now , we consider the reheating process according as ref .",
    "since there are fields which are charged under both anomalous @xmath8 and each of the subgroups of the standard model , the @xmath0-term receives a contribution from these field . as the result , the @xmath0-term takes the form of @xmath207 where @xmath208 are charged fields for both anomalous @xmath8 and gauge groups of the standard model and @xmath209 are their positive charge . in the case that fields",
    "@xmath210 of the minimal supersymmetry standard model belong to the fields @xmath208 , the @xmath204 field couples with them by the interaction , @xmath211 where @xmath212 .",
    "hence the @xmath204 field would immediately decay through this gauge interaction . on the other hand ,",
    "the decay of @xmath24 would delay .",
    "the mass of @xmath204 is @xmath213 . since @xmath214 in our model at the time of the end of inflation , the decay of @xmath24 to @xmath204",
    "would be forbidden kinematically . as a results",
    ", @xmath24 decays to light matter through higher - dimensional interactions and the reheating can be completed with an enough high reheating temperature . in this scenario ,",
    "huge entropy after the reheating by the inflaton is produced by the decay of the dilaton and moduli fields in late time .",
    "therefore , this @xmath0-term inflation model should be incorporated with the affleck - dine baryogenesis @xcite .",
    "the affleck - dine baryogenesis with the dilution by the dilaton and moduli decay have been investigated @xcite . however , the actual estimation of the baryon to entropy ratio is beyond the scope of this paper , because their full potential strongly depend on the form of the khler potential of twisted moduli and the condensation gauge groups @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is pointed out that cosmic strings generated after @xmath0-term inflation can modify the cmb anisotropy significantly @xcite . huge entropy production in a late time is desirable from this point of view , because the dilution by the entropy production is one possible way to remove the effect by cosmic strings .",
    "moreover there is one thing to note .",
    "the fi term is given by eq.([fi ] ) and its magnitude is parameterized by the expectation value of the twisted moduli .",
    "therefore the tension of cosmic strings in late time is not necessarily the same as the scale of fi term during inflation , namely , @xmath215 , where @xmath216 denotes the vev .",
    "this feature might change the situation of the effect by cosmic strings .",
    "we have studied the @xmath0-term inflation within the framework of type i string - inspired models . in this case , the twisted moduli field plays a significant role . for stabilization of the twisted moduli ,",
    "the polynomial form of the khler potential is important .",
    "the stabilization of the twisted moduli during inflation is achieved with the help of the gaugino condensation potential and this stabilization mechanism does not spoil the situation that the potential is dominated by @xmath0-term . furthermore it is a favorable property that the expectation value of the twisted moduli during inflation is enough smaller than the unity where the khler potential @xmath217 is valid , while this result leads to one shortcoming that the inflaton @xmath24 must take a somewhat large value @xmath218 during inflation .    at first , we found that the magnitude of fi term would be reducible to a desirable value within this framework even if we do not assume a hierarchically large gap between the string scale @xmath22 and the planck scale @xmath3 .",
    "concerning the second problem , or dilaton runaway problem , we found the condition to avoid this difficulty for the initial value of the dilaton . in the potential with the fixed twisted moduli",
    ", we could find that the field region where the dilaton does not run away , @xmath219 .",
    "if the dilaton takes such initial value at the pre - inflation stage , it is possible that the universe undergoes the quasi de - sitter expansion , because the dilaton can evolve slowly . of course , at the moment , we can not answer the question why the dilaton takes such initial value .",
    "the point we would like to emphasize in the present paper is that @xmath0-term inflaton is possible in type i string - inspired model under certain conditions . on the other hand , the small expectation value of the dilaton during inflation might be a good point from another point of view . in studies on the evolution of the dilaton in string",
    "cosmology , the initial condition that the dilaton takes a smaller value than the vev at the beginning , @xmath220 , has been adopted @xcite .",
    "therefore , the initial value of the dilaton set by this inflation is consistent with the initial condition in these studies .",
    "although these are based on a heterotic model , the situation would not change essentially . that might lead to the dilaton stabilization at the correct vacuum .    moreover , the ingenious point in this model is that the condition which prohibits the dilaton from rolling down the potential also suppresses the growth of the unnecessary isocurvature fluctuation .",
    "thus , we can obtain the almost adiabatic density perturbation .",
    "what we have to investigate further is the late time evolution of the universe . in the present paper , we have not estimated the baryogenesis and the effect of cosmic strings and so on , because they would involve us in other factors such as a concrete potential for the supersymmetry breaking than the potential of inflation .",
