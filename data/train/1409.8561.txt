    "misner [ 1967 ] @xcite noted that the measurement of the isotropy of the cosmic background radiation represents the most accurate observational datum in cosmology , which is even more true today with the wmap- and planck measurements .",
    "an explanation of this isotropy was provided by showing that in a large class of homogeneous but anisotropic universes , the anisotropy dies away rapidly .",
    "it was found that the most important mechanism in reducing the anisotropy is neutrino viscosity at temperatures just above @xmath0 k ( when the universe was about 1 s old : cf . zeldovich and novikov [ 1983 ] @xcite ) .",

    "many types of observations favor that our universe is homogeneous and isotropic on scales above a billion light years .",
    "the observations of the temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave radiation favor that the universe is flat , i. e. that the total density of the matter and energy contained in the universe is equal to the critical density .",
    "the discovery that the expansion of the universe accelerates could most simply be explained by repulsive gravity due to a cosmic vacuum energy with a density equal to about 70% of the critical density .",
    "the observations also favor a special type of vacuum energy which may be represented by a cosmological constant in einstein s field equations .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of this energy is proportional to the metric tensor .",
    "one may show that this means that every component of the energy - momentum tensor is lorentz invariant [ zeldovich 1968 ] @xcite and grn [ 1986 ] @xcite .",
    "hence it is not possible to measure velocity with respect to this type of energy .",
    "it may therefore be called a lorentz invariant vacuum energy , live .",
    "furthermore a large amount of cold dark matter is needed to keep the galaxies and the hoops of galaxies together because of the rapid motions of the stars in the galaxies and of the galaxies in the hoops .",
    "hence , about 30 % of the contents of the universe seem to be in the form of cold dark matter .",
    "the cosmologists therefore introduced a standard model of the universe dominated by two fluids , a lorentz invariant vacuum energy , live , and a cold fluid .",
    "the vacuum energy is usually called _ dark energy _ and the cold fluid is called _",
    "dark matter_. since the observations of the temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave radiation favor that the universe is flat , we shall only consider flat universe models .    in this review we will focus upon universe models based upon the general theory of relativity .",
    "this means among other things that we shall only review works in which the gravitational parameter is constant .",
    "it should be mentioned , though , that some researchers have investigated universe models with variable gravitational parameter ( see , for instance , belinchn , harko and mak [ 2002 ] @xcite ) .",
    "for later comparison we shall first briefly summarize the main properties the standard model which has vanishing viscosity . in this model the total pressure and density are given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the density of cold dark matter in the form of dust , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the density of a lorentz invariant vacuum energy , live , which has @xmath5 ( using units so that @xmath6 ) , and may thus be represented by a cosmological constant in einstein s field equations .    the line - element has the form ( using units so that the velocity of light in empty space is equal to 1 ) , @xmath7 the scale factor of this model is [ grn 2002 ] @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is einstein s gravitational constant .",

    "rather , we shall in the following focus attention on how the turbulent part of the energy density , called @xmath280 , can be estimated to vary from present time @xmath28 onwards .",
    "first , we write the effective energy density as a sum of two terms , @xmath281 where @xmath39 denotes the conventional macroscopic energy density in the local rest inertial system of the fluid .",
    "it is natural to assume that @xmath280 is proportional to @xmath39 itself .",

    "there seems to be no definite physical guidance to that problem , so we shall make the simplest possible choice in the following , namely write @xmath289 with @xmath290 a constant .",
    "we shall consider two different possibilities for the value of @xmath290 .",
    "the first is to put @xmath290 equal to @xmath265 in eq .",
    "( [ 9.9 ] ) , meaning that the turbulent matter behaves in the same way as the non - turbulent matter as far as the equation of state is concerned .",
    "this option is straightforward and natural , and is not quite trivial since @xmath280 and @xmath39 behave differently , in view of eq .",

    ", much less than the scale of the macroscopic fluid equations .",
    "that is , we are dealing with a non - closed physical system , of essentially the same kind as encountered in phenomenological electrodynamics in a continuous medium in special relativity .",
    "it implies that the source term in the energy balance equation has to be put in by hand .",
    "let henceforth @xmath303 refer to the non - viscous part of the fluid .",
    "we may express the energy balance as @xmath304 where the source term @xmath305 is positive , corresponding to an energy sink for the non - viscous fluid .",
    "we shall put @xmath305 equal to @xmath306 , where the specific energy dissipation @xmath276 however shall be taken to involve the large hubble parameter @xmath217 in the later stage of the development .",

    "as @xmath335 , the hubble parameter reaches a finite critical value @xmath336 the physical role of @xmath296 is thus to postpone and weaken the development towards the future singularity .    a natural choice for the eos parameter @xmath290 in the vicinity of the singularity , in view of the violent motions expected , would be @xmath337 that means , a zeldovich fluid .",
    "this is an extreme case , where the velocity of sound equals the velocity of light .",
    "we now turn to an approach that is quite different from the one above , namely to consider the cosmic fluid as a _",
