    "during the last years considerable attention has been paid to interaction of @xmath5-mesons with four nucleons @xcite .",
    "analysis of different data is mainly focused on the search for @xmath4he bound states . according to the available experimental results , the rise of the @xmath6he experimental cross section at @xmath7 seems to be not as steep as in the @xmath8he reaction . as discussed , e.g. , in ref.@xcite",
    "the most natural interpretation of this fact is that due to additional attraction caused by one extra nucleon the pole in the @xmath4he scattering matrix is shifted into the region of negative values of @xmath9 and turns out to be farther from the physical region than the @xmath10he pole .",
    "it is therefore concluded that formation of the bound @xmath4he state is highly probable .    in view of general complexity of the five - body @xmath0 problem",
    "there are still no rigorous few - body calculations of this system . at the same time , a systematic practical way of handling the @xmath11-body interaction is provided by the quasi - particle formalism in which the kernels of integral equations are represented by series of separable terms .",
    "this method becomes especially efficient if the driving two - particle potentials are governed by the nearly lying resonances or bound ( virtual ) states , like in the @xmath2 and @xmath1 case .",
    "then reasonable accuracy may be achieved with only few separable terms retained in the series .",
    "in particular , the quasi - particle formalism is shown to be very well suited for practical calculation of @xmath12 @xcite as well as @xmath13 @xcite scattering ( in ref.@xcite another method based on the hypospherical function expansion has been developed ) .    in this letter",
    "we apply the quasi - particle method to study the five - body system @xmath0 . as a formal basis",
    "we use the alt - grassberger - sandhas @xmath11-body equations derived in ref.@xcite . for the sake of simplicity we neglect influence of the spin and isospin on the interaction between nucleons , treating them as spinless indistinguishable particles .",
    "furthermore , since only the threshold @xmath4he energies are considered , we restrict all interactions to @xmath3-waves only .",
    "as is well known , separable expansion of the kernels allows one to reduce the @xmath11-body integral equations to the @xmath14-body equations , where two of @xmath11 particles in each state are effectively treated as a composite particle ( quasi - particle ) .",
    "therefore , the essence of the method is to approximate the @xmath14-particle interaction obtained in the separable - potential model again by the separable ansatz . in this respect , to simplify presentation of the formalism , we start directly from successive application of the quasi - particle technique to 2- , 3- , and 4-body subamplitudes , occurring when the five - body system is divided into groups of mutually interacting particles .    in",
    "what follows , we use the concept of partitions as introduced , e.g. , in ref.@xcite .",
    "different partitions ( as well as the quasi - particles related to these partitions ) are further denoted by the symbols @xmath15 , whereas the latin letters @xmath16 are used for numbering the terms in the separable expansions of the subamplitudes .",
    "the notation @xmath17 refers to the partition obtained by dividing the @xmath0 system into @xmath11 groups .",
    "writing @xmath18 means that the partition @xmath19 is obtained from @xmath20 via further division of the quasi - particle @xmath20 into two groups of particles .",
    "the basic ingredient of the formalism is a separable expansion of the quasi - particle amplitudes @xmath21 then the integral equations for the amplitudes @xmath22 are transformed exactly into the quasi - two - body equations which in the operator form read @xmath23 or more explicitly @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the reduced mass associated with the partition @xmath26 .",
    "the effective potentials @xmath27 are determined as matrix elements of the resolvent @xmath28 between the form factors appearing in the expansion ( [ eq1_10 ] ) @xmath29 the structure of eq.([eq1_25 ] ) is conveniently illustrated in the form of diagrams . in fig.[fig0 ] we show as an example one of the effective potentials @xmath30 , connecting two configurations of the type @xmath31 .",
    "since the nucleons are identical , the condition @xmath32 in eq.([eq1_25 ] ) means that the nucleon lines , entering the quasi - particles @xmath17 and @xmath33 and not included into the quasi - particle @xmath34 should be different . to calculate the form factors @xmath35 and the propagators @xmath36 we employed the energy dependent pole expansion ( edpe ) method of ref.@xcite .",
    "considering nucleons as indistinguishable particles we have only two different types of four - particle partitions : @xmath37 the partitions 1 and 2 and the related two - particle subsystems @xmath2 and @xmath1 will further be labeled by the index @xmath38 .    in the present calculation ,",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath1 @xmath3-wave interactions were approximated by simplest rank - one separable potentials .",
    "for @xmath2 we employed @xmath39 the corresponding @xmath40-matrix has the usual form @xmath41 with the @xmath2 propagator @xmath42^{-1}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the nucleon mass . the form factors were chosen in the yamaguchi form @xmath44 since we treat nucleons as spinless particles , the strength @xmath45 was taken as an average of the singlet and the triplet strength @xmath46 the singlet and the triplet scattering lengths , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , as well as the cut - off momentum @xmath49 were taken directly from the analysis @xcite of the low - energy @xmath50 scattering @xmath51 it is well known that the yamaguchi @xmath2 potential overestimates attraction at high momenta and yields significant overbinding already in the @xmath52he case ( see table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "therefore we also adopted the spin - independent @xmath2 potential with exponential form factors @xmath53 which yields the same binding energy @xmath54 of two nucleons .",
    "the form factors ( [ eq2_23 ] ) with parameters listed in table [ tab1 ] give for the three- and four - nucleon binding energies , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the values which are rather close to those of the @xmath52he and @xmath57he nuclei .",
    "at the same time , with the gauss form factors we have a visibly larger value of the @xmath2 effective range @xmath58 ( see table [ tab1 ] ) .",

    "as one can see , satisfactory accuracy is achieved with @xmath131 , @xmath132 . in principle , already with first four terms in each expansion the resulting scattering length is within less than 2@xmath133 of the correct value .",
    "thus , also in the five - body case @xmath0 the quasi - particle approach based on the edpe method of ref.@xcite is very suitable for practical applications .",

    "direct calculation shows that the main reason of this somewhat unexpected result is rather rapid decrease of the @xmath1 scattering amplitude in the subthreshold region ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) . because of essentially stronger binding of @xmath57he in comparison to @xmath52he , in the former case the effective in - medium @xmath1 interaction acts at lower internal @xmath1 energies , thus leading to general reduction of the attractive @xmath1 forces ( this question was addressed in detail in refs.@xcite )",
    "this effective weakening may qualitatively explain why the peculiar slope in the @xmath5 spectrum at low energies seen in the data for @xmath6he @xcite and @xmath138he @xcite becomes less steep , when we turn from @xmath10he to @xmath4he .",

    "applying separable representation firstly to the @xmath147 and @xmath148 and then to the @xmath149 and @xmath106 kernels we have solved the five - body alt - grassberger - sandhas equations reducing them to a coupled set of quasi - two - body equations having lippmann - schwinger structure .",
    "the predicted value of @xmath150 is positive and turns out to be smaller than @xmath151 .",
    "this finding should be attributed to effective weakening of the in - medium @xmath1 interaction .",
    "according to our calculation , increase of the attractive forces due to an extra nucleon in @xmath57he is overwhelmed by stronger suppression of the subthreshold @xmath1 interaction in a more dense nucleus .",
    "the resulting attraction in the @xmath0 system is too weak and does not support existence of the @xmath4he bound state , at least with the @xmath1 parameters , used in the present calculation",

    "finally , we note that although our results obviously suffer from oversimplified treatment of the @xmath2 potential , they demonstrate applicability of the quasi - particle formalism to the five - body @xmath4he problem .",
    "the edpe method provides rather rapid convergence of the separable expansion , so that transition from @xmath13 to the @xmath0 case is performed without drastic increase of numerical complexity .",
