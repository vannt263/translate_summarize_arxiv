    "quasicrystals are a class of ordered materials possessing quasiperiodic positional order _ and _ long - range orientational order .",
    "the intriguing property of quasicrystals is that their symmetry does not belong to the traditional crystallographic point groups . as such",
    ", the discovery of quasicrystals has led to a redefinition of the term crystal as any ordered materials having an essentially discrete diffraction pattern . for a traditional crystal or periodic crystal ,",
    "the discrete diffraction pots form an periodic array on their reciprocal lattice . for a quasicrystal ,",
    "the discrete diffraction spots densely fill the reciprocal space although , in practice , only the most intense reflections will be observed . since the discovery of quasicrystals by shechtman@xcite in a rapidly - quenched al - mn alloy thirty years ago",
    ", materials with quasicrystalline order have been found in more than a hundred different metallic alloys@xcite . besides the large number of quasicrystals found in metallic alloys ,",
    "quasicrystalline order has been observed in many soft condensed matter systems , including micelle - forming liquid crystals@xcite , block copolymers@xcite , colloidal suspensions@xcite and binary mixtures of nanoparticles@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the metallic quasicrystals , the building blocks of soft - matter quasicrystals are on a much larger length - scale , e.g.  tens to hundreds of nanometers .",
    "soft quasicrystals provide an interesting platform for the study of fundamentals of quasiperiodic long - range orders , as well as potential candidates for advanced applications based on their unique electronic or photonic properties .    due to a large number of studies since the discovery of quasicrystals , their structure and symmetry are now well understood@xcite .",
    "in particular , quasicrystalline order can be described as the projection from a higher - dimensional periodic lattice@xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the study of the thermodynamic stability of quasicrystals requires the examination of their free energy , which remains a challenge@xcite .",
    "theoretical approaches to investigating the origin and stability of an ordered phase , including periodic crystals and quasicrystals , often involve minimizing an appropriate free energy functional of the system , and comparing the free energies of different candidate structures@xcite .",
    "therefore a systematic examination of the stability of quasicrystals requires the availability of suitable free energy functionals and accurate methods to compute the free energy of phases with quasicrystalline order .",
    "several microscopic models have been developed over the years to explore ordered structures , which have yielded surprisingly rich phase diagrams . in some cases even stable quasicrystals",
    "are found@xcite .",
    "parallel to the development of microscopic models , phenomenological theories based on coarse - grained free energy functionals have been widely used to study phases and phase transitions of ordered systems .",
    "the utilization of such landau - type theories provides an effective method to investigate the phase behaviour of physical systems exhibiting ordered phases . in the case of block copolymers , a free energy functional developed by leibler@xcite",
    "has provided useful insight and a rather accurate description of the ordered phases of block copolymers .",
    "similarly , for soft quasicrystals , a number of coarse - grained model free energy functionals have been proposed to explore the quasicrystalline order arising from model systems with more than one characteristic length - scales@xcite . among these models , the free energy functional proposed by lifshitz and petrich , or the lifshitz - petrich ( lp ) model@xcite ,",
    "may be the simplest model with two length - scales .",
    "initially the lp model was developed to study parametrically - excited surface waves ( faraday wave@xcite ) . using a two - mode approximation ,",
    "lifshitz and petrich obtained stable two - dimensional patterns with two- , six- and twelve - fold symmetries for the lp model . recently",
    "the lp model has been used to explain the source of stability of soft quasicrystals with dodecagonal symmetry . in particular ,",
    "the stability of soft quasicrystals is attributed to the existence of two length - scales and three - body interactions in the free energy functional@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the existence and stability of other quasiperiodic structures within the lp model remain an open question .",
    "besides a proper free energy functional of the system , the study of thermodynamic stability requires methods to compute the free energy of the different ordered phases accurately . due to the spatial periodicity",
    ", the computation of periodic crystals can be carried out within a unit cell with periodic boundary conditions . on the contrary",
    ", it is not possible to reduce the structure of a quasicrystal to unit cells because quasicrystals are space - filling ordered structure without spatial periodicity . in the literature , a common method to overcome",
    "this difficulty is to utilize periodic structures with large unit cells to approximate quasicrystals@xcite ; their free energies are also approximated by that of these periodic orders as well .",
    "however , it is not immediately obvious whether such approximation of the free energy is accurate .",
    "indeed , jiang and zhang@xcite recently showed that the free energy density of dodecagonal quasicrystal is _ always _ lower than its approximant evaluated by this approximated approach .    an alternative approach to calculate the free energy of quasicrystals is based on the observation that quasiperiodic lattices can be generated by a cut - and - project method from higher - dimensional periodic lattices@xcite .",
    "it follows that the density and free energy of quasicrystals can be obtained using the quasiperiodic lattices derived from the higher - dimensional periodic structure . a previous approach along this line is the gaussian method , in which the density profile of a quasicrystal is assumed to be given by a sum of gaussian functions centered at the lattice points of a predetermined quasicrystalline lattice@xcite .",
    "the width of the gaussian function is treated as a variational parameter , which is optimized to minimize the free energy of the system .",
    "more recently , jiang and zhang@xcite have proposed a generalized spectral method for characterizing the density profile and computing the free energy of quasiperiodic structures . instead of working in the real space",
    ", jiang and zhang utilized the fact that the fourier spectrum of quasicrystalline structures can be lifted into that of a higher - dimensional periodic structure , so that the fourier spectrum of the quasiperiodic pattern can be obtained by projecting the higher - dimensional reciprocal lattice vectors onto the original fourier space through a projection matrix .",
    "details of the lifting and projection depend on the symmetry and rank of the desired structures .",
    "as a special case , the projection method can also be used to investigate periodic crystals by setting the projection matrix as an identity matrix . from this perspective",
    "the projection method provides a unified computational framework for the study of periodic crystals and quasicrystals .",
    "in particular , the free energy of periodic crystals and quasicrystals can be obtained with the same accuracy .    in the current work",
    ", we apply the projection method to study the relative stability of different ordered phases of the lp model .",
    "the main objective is to investigate the existence and relative stability of periodic structures and quasicrystals beyond the 12-fold symmetric patterns .",
    "specifically , two - dimensional quasiperiodic patterns with 12- , 10- and 8-fold symmetries as well as several periodic crystal structures including the three - dimensional body - centered - cubic ( bcc ) phase ( with space group @xmath0 ) have been obtained as possible phases of the lp model .",
    "a comparison of the free energies of these candidate phases leads to the construction of a phase diagram of the system , thus extending the earlier results of lifshitz and petrich@xcite .",
    "in particular , the theoretical study predicts that the decagonal quasicrystal can become a stable phase .",
    "since the discovery of quasicrystals , a large number of theoretical studies have been carried out to investigate their symmetry , structure characterization and thermodynamic properties . in general , the formation of quasicrystalline phases is characterized by two or more length - scales .",
    "one possibility of realizing two length - scales is to have a pairwise interaction that depends on two length - scales explicitly .",
    "for example , a recent monte carlo simulation study by dotera _",
    "et al._@xcite demonstrated that a simple step - like interaction potential with two length - scales could lead to the formation of various two - dimensional quasicrystals .",
    "another possibility of realizing two length - scales is to construct a landau - type free energy functional with two or more characteristic length - scales@xcite . in particular , lifshitz and petrich@xcite",
    "have proposed a landau theory with a scale order parameter and with a second - order term containing two length - scales explicitly .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the lp model exhibits dodecagonal quasicrystal .",
    "in what follows we will use the lp theory as a model free energy functional to examine the relative stability of various two - dimensional quasicrystals .    in order to examine the relative stability of different ordered phases , the free energies of the candidate structures have to be evaluated accurately .",
    "the candidate phases correspond to free energy local minima in the free energy landscape of the system .",
    "therefore the computation of their free energies corresponds to finding the solutions of the euler - lagrange equation of the free energy functional . for quasiperiodic phases , a direct computation in the real space",
    "can only be carried out approximately using periodic approxmants or other truncation methods . on the other hand ,",
    "the computation can be carried out in reciprocal or fourier space using projection method as described recently by jiang and zhang@xcite . with appropriate choice of the fourier basis ,",
    "the projection method provides a unified numerical framework to study periodic crystals and quasicrystals with the same accuracy .    in this work",
    "we apply the projection method to the lp model and determine the relative stability of different phases including two - dimensional dodecagonal , decagonal and octagonal quasicrystals .",
    "the rest of this section gives a brief introduction to the lp model and the projection method for ordered phases .",
    "the lifshitz - petrich model is a generic landau theory for a physical system with two length - scales@xcite .",
    "the original lp model was motivated by experiments on the parametrically - excited surface waves , which exhibits dodecagonal quasiperiodic order@xcite .",
    "lifshitz and petrich@xcite introduced a spatial - varying scale order parameter , @xmath1 , and constructed a free energy functional , @xmath2 $ ] , which governs the pattern - forming dynamics of the system .",
    "the essential characteristic of the lp model is that the disordered phase , corresponding to @xmath3 , undergoes an instability simultaneously at two wave - lengths .",
    "specifically the lifshitz - petrich model is defined by the free energy functional , @xmath4 = \\,\\frac{1}{v}\\int      d\\mathbf{r}\\,\\big\\{\\frac{c}{2}&[(\\nabla^2 + 1)(\\nabla^2+q^2)\\phi]^2      \\\\      & -\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}\\phi^2-\\frac{\\alpha}{3}\\phi^3+\\frac{1}{4}\\phi^4\\big\\ } ,      \\label{eqn : lp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the volume of the system , @xmath6 is an energy penalty factor , @xmath7 is a temperature - like controlling parameter , and @xmath8 is a parameter characterizing the third - order interactions .",
    "the order parameter @xmath1 corresponds to the density profile for a soft matter system . comparing with the usual landau theory of phase transition ,",
    "the crucial feature of the lp model is the occurrence of the second length - scale specified by the parameter @xmath9",
    ". it should be noticed that the basic length scale of the model is take as the unit wavelength ( as specified by the @xmath10 term ) and the second length - scale is specified by a wavevector , @xmath9 , which is the ratio of the two characteristic length - scales . in the case of the surface waves ,",
    "the origin of the two length - scales is the two - frequency parametric excitation of the fluid surface@xcite . in the case of generic soft matter system",
    ", the two length - scales could be from the pairwise interactions of the soft particles . in the current work the parameter @xmath9 is taken as one of the controlling parameters of the systems . in principle , free energy minimization should be carried out with respect to @xmath9 as well . however , carrying out such minimization is a formidable task .",
    "instead , we study the relative stability of different patterns with a limited number of @xmath9-values .    in their original study@xcite ,",
    "lifshitz and petrich used a two - mode approximation to describe the different ordered phases .",
    "they demonstrated that the simple lp model exhibits various two - dimensional ordered patterns with 2- , 4- , 6- and 12-fold symmetries , and obtained a phase diagram for the lp model based on the two - mode approximation .",
    "subsequent studies@xcite have demonstrated that such free energy functionals with two length - scales could be considered as a generic model for self - assembling soft matter systems , providing insights into the essential features of soft quasicrystals forming in dendrimers , tetrablock terpolymers and micelle - forming liquid crystals .",
    "furthermore , the theory with two length - scales has been used to study the soft - particle systems@xcite .",
    "it is also noticed that three - body interactions characterized by the cubic term in the lp free energy functional plays an important role in stabilizing quasicrystals .      for a given set of parameters , the candidate phases are local minima of the free energy functional , corresponding to solutions of the euler - lagrange equation , @xmath11 for the lp model , the euler - lagrange equation ( eq .  [ eqn : el ] ) corresponds to a eighth - order nonlinear partial differential equation , which can be solved using a number of numerical methods . for structures with quasicrystalline order ,",
    "an efficient method is the projection method formulated in the fourier space .",
    "it is based on the observation that the fourier spectrum of a @xmath12-dimensional aperiodic structure , such as a quasicrystal , consists of bragg peaks on a , @xmath13-dimensional lattice , where @xmath14 . in other words , the fourier spectrum of the quasiperiodic structure",

    "the dimensionality @xmath13 and the specific form of the projection matrix is determined by the structure of the ordered phases@xcite .",
    "the expression of @xmath22 is not unique and relies on the symmetry of the quasicrystals .",
    "more precisely , it depends on the choice of the basis vectors .    using the @xmath13-dimensional vectors and the projection operator , the fourier expansion of any quasiperiodic function @xmath1 can be written in the form , @xmath24 in the above expression , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "one simple observation is that the expansion ( eq .  [ eqn : pm ] ) allows us to treat the @xmath12-dimensional quasiperiodic structure as a slice of an @xmath13-dimensional periodic structure whose orientation is determined by @xmath22 .    expanding the order parameter @xmath1 in the form of eq .",

    ", it has been shown that , when using the projection method , it suffices to have a free energy functional defined in the lower ( physical ) @xmath12-dimensional space .",
    "therefore the computations are implemented in the @xmath13-dimensional space , while the final results represent the @xmath12-dimensional structures through ( [ eqn : pm ] ) .",

    "the choice of @xmath9 for the three two - dimensional quasicrystals of interest have been given before .",
    "for the periodic crystals , different values of @xmath9 may affect the free energy of the sibling periodic crystals .",

    "therefore , this structure is not included in the following analysis .",
    "the candidate structures are therefore composed of the three quasicrystals ( ddqc , dqc and oqc ) , the hex phase and the bcc phase .",
    "using the free energy of the hex phase as the baseline , the free energies of the ddqc , dqc , oqc and bcc phases as a function of @xmath8 are shown in fig.[fig : energyplotxi-0.1 ] with @xmath75 .",
    "from the results shown in fig.[fig : energyplotxi-0.1 ] , it is obvious that the oqc has higher free energy than the other four candidate structures .",
    "thus the oqc structure is a metastable phase of the system with the given set of parameters . on the other hand , the other four candidate structures ( ddqc , dqc , hex and bcc ) can become equilibrium phases with the lowest free energy . specifically ,",
    "when the value of @xmath8 is increased , the phase transition sequence is predicted to be ddqc to bcc to dqc to hex .",
    "the corresponding stable regions of these phases are @xmath76 ( ddqc ) , @xmath77 ( bcc ) , @xmath78 ( dqc ) , and @xmath79 ( hex ) .",
    "this predicted phase behaviour for finite @xmath6 is very different from that of infinite @xmath6 as given by lifshitz and petrich@xcite . for infinite @xmath6",

    "the free energy of the oqc structure is not included here since the oqc is always a metastable phase of the model system ( see fig.[fig : energyplotxi-0.1 ] ) . from fig.[fig : energyplotxi-0.1part ] ( a ) , it can be concluded that the ddqc is favoured by the fundamental modes because it has the largest number , @xmath41 , of nonzero fourier modes located on the circles with radii of @xmath56 and @xmath9 , thus forming the most triangles in the fourier space . on the other hand ,",
    "since the energy penalty factor @xmath6 is finite , the higher - harmonics can not be ignored .",
    "as fig.[fig : energyplotxi-0.1part ] ( b ) shows , these higher - harmonics have large impacts on the free energy of the system .",

    ". meanwhile , the differential term is no longer zero , which increases the energy . due to the competition of the fundamental modes and higher - harmonics , the stable phases are ddqc , bcc , dqc and hex patterns as @xmath8 increases .    to further understand the influence of the higher - harmonics on the stability region of various phases , we set @xmath66 and examine the contributions to the free energy as a function of @xmath8 . in this case , the quadratic and cubic terms in eq .",

    "similar to the case of @xmath85 , the contributions to the free energy from different fourier modes can be used to understand the phase behavior ( see fig.[fig : energyplotxi0.5part ] ) .     for fixed @xmath66 and @xmath64 .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    as is noted before , since the fundamental fourier modes of ddqc and bcc structures can form more triangles than that of the hex phase , the ddqc and bcc phases have lower free energy from the fundamental modes , as shown fig.[fig : energyplotxi0.5part ] ( a ) . however , the free energy differences in both fundamental and higher - harmonic parts between the dqc and hex phases exhibit non - monotonic behaviour . specifically , when @xmath8 is small , hex has lower energy value in the fundamental part .",
    "as @xmath8 increases , dqc becomes more favoured .",
    "when @xmath8 is large enough , hex has lower free energy again . from eqs .   and",
    ", we find that dqc has more two- , three- and four - body interactions in the fundamental part of energy than the hex does .",
    "more precisely , when @xmath8 is small , the sum of the cubic terms in the energy expression of dqc is smaller than that of the hex , and the sums of the quadratic and quartic terms are larger than the counterparts for hex .",
    "therefore , when @xmath8 is small , the quadratic term dominates the free energy ; hex thus has lower free energy than the dqc . as @xmath8 increases , the cubic term becomes important in @xmath43 , and thus dqc has lower energy in the fundamental part .",
    "when @xmath8 is sufficiently large , the value of cubic and quartic terms of dqc becomes comparable with the hex ( results not shown ) .",
    "thus the difference in the quadratic terms dominates the difference of the free energy in this case .",
    "therefore , hex becomes favored in energy again .",
    "the energy differences in the higher - harmonic part are given in fig.[fig : energyplotxi0.5part ] ( b ) .",
    "the ddqc and bcc phases have relatively high energy as before .",
    "the energy difference between dqc and hex has the similar behavior with the fundamental part , which can be explained in a similar way .",
    "therefore , as @xmath8 increases , the phase transition occurs in the sequence of hex , bcc , dqc , and hex .",
    "the phase transition sequence for other values of @xmath7 can be obtained by repeating the free energy comparison among the candidate structures .",
    "the results of the phase transition sequences can be summarized in terms of phase diagrams in the @xmath7-@xmath8 plane . for a fixed value of @xmath64 , the phase diagram in the range of @xmath88 and @xmath89",
    "is presented in fig.[fig : phasediagram ] for the lp free energy functional .    .",
    "lam and d represent the 2-fold pattern and disordered phase , respectively . for ddqc and dqc",
    ", the structural parameter @xmath9 equals to @xmath90 and @xmath53 , respectively . for periodic crystals , @xmath48 . ]    besides the ddqc , dqc , oqc , hex and bcc phases discussed above , two more phases , the 2-fold symmetric pattern , or the lamellar phase ( lam ) , and the disordered phase ( d ) are included in the phase diagram .",
    "the regions of stability of the different phases are obtained by comparing the free energy of these seven candidate structures .",
    "the phase boundaries are determined by calculating the cross over point of the free energies of the two neighbouring phases . because the contribution from the higher - harmonics becomes significant for the cases with finite values of @xmath6 , the predicted phase diagram from the current study includes more features when compared with the previous phase diagram obtained from the analytic calculation using the two - mode approximation@xcite .    in the previous work , lifshitz and petrich",
    "used the two - mode approximation method@xcite to analytically analyze the phase behavior of the lp model when @xmath6 is sufficiently large .",
    "it is found that when @xmath47 and @xmath80 , the lam phase is stable for @xmath91 ; the hex phase has the lowest energy for @xmath92 ; and the ddqc is stable for @xmath93 . while the generic feature of the phase diagrams is maintained ,",
    "there are significant differences between the analytic phase diagram and the numerical result presented in the current work , which contains more features by taking higher - harmonics into account .",
    "the first noticeable difference is that the current phase diagram includes the dqc as a new equilibrium quasicrystal phase , whereas the previous phase diagram only contains the ddqc as the unique stable quasicrystalline phase .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the dqc - hex phase boundary possess a special turning point at @xmath94 .",
    "increasing @xmath8 at @xmath95 leads to a reentrance transition of the hex phase .",
    "another interesting feature is the prediction of a triple point at @xmath96 , at which the bcc , dqc and hex phases coexist .",
    "the oqc is only observed as a metastable phase , which is in agreement with the analytic result by two - mode approximation .",
    "moreover , a three - dimensional phase with spheres packed on a body - centred - cubic lattice ( bcc ) is included in the current phase diagram .",
    "in summary , we have applied the projection method to obtain quasicrystalline structures as possible local minima of the lp free energy functional .",
    "the projection method enables accurate numerical calculations of the free energy of the quasicrystals , resulting in a phase diagram with more accurate phase boundaries and , most importantly , more ordered phases as compared with the previous study .",
    "specifically , three two - dimensional quasiperiodic patterns , namely the oqc , dqc and ddqc structures , and several periodic phases ( lam , hex and bcc ) emerge from our calculations as candidate structures for the construction of the phase diagram . by comparing the free energy of the candidate structures , a phase diagram for the case of @xmath97",
    "is obtained in the @xmath7-@xmath8 place .",
    "it is predicted that for the lp free energy function given in eq.[eqn : lp ] , the 10-fold ( dqc ) and 12-fold ( ddqc ) symmetric quasicrystals can become equilibrium phases in the phase diagram . on the other hand the 8-fold ( oqc ) symmetric quasicrystal is found to be a metastable phase of the model system .",
    "the prediction of a stable dqc phase within the lp free energy functional is a new result .",
    "the present study complements and extends the previous work of lifshitz and petrich@xcite .",
    "the two - mode approximation provides an accurate description of the lp model at the limit of @xmath98 , at which the wavevectors are forced to be on two circles defined by @xmath60 and @xmath59 . a finite value of @xmath6 , as exemplified by the case of @xmath64 , allows the occurrence of higher - harmonics other than the modes with @xmath60 and @xmath59 .",
    "the additional fourier modes lead to phase diagram at finite @xmath6 that is significantly different from the phase behavior of the case of @xmath98 .",
    "in particular , the quasicrystalline phases dqc , ddqc , the lamellar phase , hex and bcc phase are predicted to be potentially stable phases for the lp free energy functional .",
    "these results provide a good understanding of the rich phase behaviour contained in the simple lp model .",
