    "the two asymmetric b - factories at slac and kek have provided a striking confirmation of the ckm paradigm  @xcite .",
    "existing experimental information from the indirect cp violation parameter , @xmath0 for the @xmath1 , semileptonic @xmath2 and @xmath3 mixing along with lattice calculations predict that in the sm , @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "this is in very good agreement with the belle and babar result  @xcite : + _ cp(b^0k^0 ) = 2=.726.037 [ psik ] this leads to the conclusion that the ckm phase of the standard model ( sm ) is the dominant contributor to @xmath5 .",
    "that , of course , also means that cp - odd phase(s ) due to beyond the standard model ( bsm ) sources may well cause only small deviations from the sm in b - physics .",
    "+ actually , there are several reasons to think that bsm phase(s ) may cause only small deviations in b - physics . in this regard ,",
    "sm itself teaches a very important lesson .",
    "we know now that the ckm phase is 0(1 ) ( actually , the cp violation parameter @xmath6 is 0(.3 )  @xcite ) .",
    "the cp effects that it causes on different observables though is quite different . in k - decays ,",
    "the cp asymmetrics are @xmath7 . in charm physics , also there are good reasons to expect small observable effects . in top physics , the ckm phase causes completely negligible effects  @xcite .",
    "thus only in b - decays , the large asymmetries ( often 0(1 ) ) are caused by the ckm phase .",
    "so even if the bsm phase(s ) are 0(1 ) it is unlikely that again in b - physics they will cause large effects just as the sm does .",
    "situation with regard to bsm cp - odd phase(s ) ( @xmath9 ) is somewhat reminiscent of the neutrino mass ( @xmath8 )  @xcite .",
    "there was no good reason for @xmath8 to be zero ; similarly , there are none for @xmath9 to be zero either . in the case of @xmath10 , there were the solar @xmath11 results that were suggestive for a very long time ; similarly , in the case of @xmath9 , the fact that in the sm , baryogenesis is difficult to accomodate serves as the beacon .",
    "+ it took decades to show @xmath8 is not zero : @xmath12 had to be lowered from @xmath13 around 1983 down to @xmath14 before @xmath15 was established via neutrino oscillations .",
    "we can hope for better luck with @xmath9 but there is no good reason to be too optimistic ; therefore , we should not rely on luck but rather we should seriously prepare for this possibility .",
    "+ to recapitulate , just as the sm - ckm phase is 0(1 ) , but it caused only @xmath16 cp symmetries in k- decays , an 0(1 ) bsm - cp - odd phase may well cause only very small asymmetries in b - physics . to search for such small effects : + 1 ) we need lots and lots of clean b s ( _ i.e. _ @xmath17 ) or more ) + 2 ) intensive study of @xmath18 mesons ( in addition to b s ) becomes very important as comparison between the two types of b - mesons will teach us how to improve quantitative estimates of flavor symmetry breaking effects .",
    "+ 3 ) we also need clean predictions from theory ( wherein item 2 should help ) .",
    "improved searches for bsm - cp - odd phase(s ) can be subdivided into the following main categories : +   + a ) indirect searches with theory input + b ) indirect searches without theory input + c ) direct searches .",
    "+      among the four parameters of the ckm matrix , @xmath19 and @xmath6 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 @xcite are known quite precisely ; @xmath22 and @xmath6 still need to be determined accurately .",
    "efforts have been underway for many years to determine these parameters .",
    "the angles @xmath23 , of the unitarity triangle ( ut ) can be determined once one knows the 4-ckm parameters .    a well studied strategy for determining these from experimental data requires knowledge of hadronic matrix elements . efforts to calculate",
    "several of the relevant matrix elements on the lattice , with increasing accuracy , have been underway for past many years .",
    "a central role is played by the following four inputs  @xcite :    * @xmath24 from the lattice with @xmath0 from experiment * @xmath25 from the lattice with @xmath26 from experiment * @xmath27 from the lattice with @xmath28 from experiment * @xmath29 from experiment , along with input from phenomenology especially heavy quark symmetry as well as the lattice .    as mentioned above , for the past few years",
    ", these inputs have led to the important constraint : @xmath30 which is found to be in very good agreement with direct experimental determination , eq .",
    "[ psik ] .    despite severe limitations ( e.g. the so - called quenched approximation )",
    "these lattice inputs provided valuable help so that with b - factory measurements one arrives at the very important conclusion that in @xmath31 the ckm - phase is the dominant contributor ; any new physics ( np ) contribution is unlikely to be greater than about 15% .",
    "what sort of progress can we expect from the lattice in the next several years in these ( indirect ) determination of the ut ? to answer this it is useful to look back and compare where we were to where we are now .",
    "perhaps this gives us an indication of the pace of progress of the past several years .",
    "lattice calculations of matrix elements around 1995  @xcite yielded ( amongst other things ) @xmath32 , whereas the corresponding error decreased to around @xmath33 around 2001  @xcite .",
    "in addition to @xmath34 , such calculations also now constrain @xmath35 with an error of around @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "there are three important developments that should help lattice calculations in the near future : +    1 .",
    "exact chiral symmetry can be maintained on the lattice .",
    "this is especially important for light quark physics .",
    "2 .   relatively inexpensive methods for simulations with dynamical quarks ( esp . using improved staggered fermions  @xcite ) have become available .",
    "this should help overcome limitations of the quenched approximation .",
    "3 .   about a factor of 20 increase in computing power",
    "is now being used compared to a few years ago .    as a specific example",
    "one can see that the error on @xmath24 with the 1st use of dynamical domain wall fermions  @xcite now seems to be reduced by about a factor of two  @xcite . in the next few years or so errors on lattice determination of ckm parameters should decrease appreciably , perhaps by a factor of 3 .",
    "so the error in @xmath37 ; @xmath38 etc . while this increase in accuracy is very welcome , and will be very useful , there are good reasons to believe , experiment will move ahead of theory in direct determinations of unitarity angles in the next 5 years .",
    "( at present , experiment is already ahead of theory for @xmath39 ) .",
    "one of the most exciting developments of recent years in b - physics is that methods have been developed so that all three angles of the ut can be determined cleanly with very small theory errors .",
    "this is very important as it can open up several ways to test the sm - ckm paradigm of cp violation ; in particular , the possibility of searching for small deviations . let us very briefly recapitulate the methods in question : +    * time dependent cp asymmetry ( tdcpa ) measurements in @xmath40 type of final states should give the angle @xmath34 very precisely with an estimated irreducible theory error ( ite ) of @xmath41  @xcite . *",
    "direct cp ( dircp ) studies in @xmath42 gives @xmath43 very + cleanly  @xcite .",
    "* tdcpa measurements in @xmath44 gives @xmath45 _ and _ also @xmath34 very cleanly  @xcite .",
    "* in addition , tdcpa measurements in @xmath46 type modes also gives @xmath43 very cleanly  @xcite .",
    "* determination of the rate for the cp violating decay @xmath47 is a very clean way to measure the wolfenstein parameter @xmath6 , which is indeed the cp - odd phase in the ckm matrix  @xcite .",
    "+ it is important to note that the ite for each of these methods is expected to be @xmath48 , in fact perhaps even @xmath49 . * finally let us briefly mention that , tdcpa studies of @xmath50 or @xmath51 or @xmath52 gives @xmath53  @xcite .",
    "however , in this case , isospin conservation needs be used and that requires , _ assuming _ that electro - weak penguins ( ewp ) make negligible contribution .",
    "this introduces some model dependence and may cause an error of order a few degrees , _",
    "i.e. _ for @xmath53 extraction the ite may well end up being o(a few % ) .",
    "however , given that there are three types of final states each of which allows a determination of @xmath53 , it is quite likely that further studies of these methods will lead to a reduction of the common source of error originating from isopsin violation due to the ewp .",
    "+ it is extremely important that we make use of these opportunities afforded to us by as many of these very clean redundant measurements as possible . in order to exploit these methods to their fullest potential and get",
    "the angles with errors of order ite will , for sure , require a super - b factory(sbf )  @xcite .",
    "+ this in itself constitutes a strong enough reason for a sbf , as it represents a great opportunity to precisely nail down the important parameters of the ckm paradigm .",
    "below we briefly discuss why the precision extraction of @xmath43 seems so promising .    for definiteness ,",
    "let us recall the basic features of the ads method  @xcite .",
    "in this interference is sought between two amplitudes of roughly similar size _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath54 and @xmath55 where the @xmath56 and @xmath57 decay to common final states such as the simple two body ones like @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 or they may also be multibody modes e.g. the dalitz decay @xmath62 , @xmath63 etc .",
    "it is easy to see that the interference is between a colored allowed b decay followed by doubly cabibbo suppressed d decay and a color - suppressed b decay followed by cabibbo allowed d decay and consequently then interference tends to be maximal and should lead to large asymmetries .    for a given ( common )",
    "final state of @xmath56 and @xmath57 the amplitude involves three unknowns : the color suppressed br(@xmath55 ) , which is not directly accessible to experiment  @xcite , the strong phase @xmath64 and the weak phase @xmath43 .",
    "corresponding to each such final state ( fs ) there are two observables : the rate for @xmath65 decay and for the @xmath66 decay .",
    "thus , if you stick to just one common fs of @xmath56 , @xmath57 , you do not have enough information to solve for @xmath43 .",
    "if you next consider two common fs of @xmath56 and @xmath57 then you have one additional unknown ( a strong phase ) making a total of 4-unknowns with also 4-observables .",
    "so with two final states the system becomes soluble , i.e. we can then use the experimental data to solve not only the value of @xmath43 but also the strong phases and the suppressed br for @xmath55 . with",
    "n common fs of @xmath56 and @xmath57 , you will have 2n observables and n + 2 unknowns .",
    "we need @xmath67 i.e. @xmath68 . the crucial point ,",
    "though , is that there are a very large number of possible common modes of @xmath56 and @xmath57 which can all be used to improve the determination of @xmath43 .",
    "let us briefly mention some of the relevant common modes of @xmath56 and @xmath57 :    * the cp - eigenstate modes , originally discussed by glw  @xcite : @xmath69 [ @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 ; @xmath75 , .... * cp - non - eigenstates ( cpnes ) , discussed by gls  @xcite : @xmath76 , @xmath77 ... these are singly cabibbo suppressed modes .",
    "* cpnes modes originally discussed by ads  @xcite : @xmath78[@xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 .... ] * there are also many multibody modes , such as the dalitz @xmath56 decays : @xmath82  @xcite or @xmath62  @xcite etc ; and also modes such as @xmath83 , @xmath84 , or indeed @xmath85  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , multibody modes such as @xmath86 or @xmath87  @xcite can also be used .",
    "[ un_det ] and fig .",
    "[ over_det ] show how combining different strategies helps a great deal .",
    "in the fig we show @xmath88 versus @xmath43 .",
    "as indicated above when you consider an individual final state of @xmath56 and @xmath57 then of course there are 3 unknowns ( the strong phase , the weak phase ( @xmath43 ) and the  unmeasureable \" br ) and only two observables ( the rate for @xmath65 and the rate for @xmath66 ) .",
    "so in the figure , for a fixed value of @xmath43 , we search for the minimum of the @xmath88 by letting the strong phase and the  unmeasureable \" br take any value they want .    fig .  [ un_det ] and",
    "[ over_det ] show situtation with regard to under determined and over determined cases respectively .",
    "the upper horizontal line corresponds roughly to the low luminosity i.e. comparable to the current b - factories@xcite whereas the lower horizontal curve is relevant for a super b - factory . in fig .",
    "[ un_det ] in blue is shown the case when only the input from ( glw ) cpes modes of @xmath56 is used ; note all the cpes modes are included here .",
    "you see that the resolution on @xmath43 then is very poor .",
    "in particular , this method is rather ineffective in giving a lower bound ; its upper bound is better .",
    "in contrast , a single ads mode ( @xmath58 ) is very effective in so far as lower bound is concerned , but it does not yield an effective upper bound ( red ) .",
    "note that in these two cases one has only two observables and 3 unknowns . in purple",
    "is shown the situation when these two methods are combined .",
    "then at least at high luminosity there is significant improvement in attaining a tight upper bound ; lower bound obtained by ads alone seems largely unaffected .    shown in green",
    "is another under determined case consisting of the use of a single ads mode , though it includes @xmath89 as well @xmath90 ; this again dramatically improves the lower bound . from an examination of these curves",
    "it is easy to see that combining information from different methods and modes improves the determination significantly  @xcite .",
    "next we briefly discuss some over determined cases ( fig .",
    "[ over_det ] ) . in purple",
    "all the cpes modes of @xmath56 are combined with just one doubly cabibbo - suppressed ( cpnes ) mode .",
    "here there are 4 observables for the 4 unknowns and one gets a reasonable solution at least especially for the high luminosity case .",
    "the black curve is different from the purple one in only one respect ; the black one also includes the @xmath91 from @xmath92 where subsequently the @xmath91 gives rise to a @xmath56 .",
    "comparison of the black one with the purple shows considerable improvement by including the @xmath91 . in this case",
    "the number of observables ( 8) exceeds the number of unknowns ( 6 ) .",
    "actually , the @xmath91 can decay to @xmath56 via two modes : @xmath93 or @xmath94 .",
    "bondar and gershon @xcitehave made a very nice observation that the strong phase for the @xmath43 emission is opposite to that of the @xmath95 emission .",
    "inclusion ( blue curves ) of both types of emission increases the number of observables to 12 with no increase in number of unknowns .",
    "so this improves the resolving power for @xmath43 even more .",
    "the orange curves show the outcome when a lot more input is included ; not only @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath56 , @xmath91 but also dalitz and multibody decays of @xmath56 are included .",
    "but the gains now are very modest ; thus once the number of observables exceeds the number of unknowns by a few ( say o(3 ) ) further increase in input only has a minimal impact .",
    "let us briefly recall that another important way to get these angles is by studying time - dependent cp ( tdcp ) ( or mixing - induced cp ( mixcp ) ) violation via @xmath98 .",
    "once again , all the common decay modes of @xmath56 and @xmath57 can be used just as in the case of direct cp studies involving @xmath99 decays . therefore ,",
    "needless to say input from charm factory  @xcite also becomes desirable for mixcp studies of @xmath98 as it is for direct cp using @xmath99 .",
    "it is important to stress that this method gives not only the combinations of the angles ( 2@xmath100 ) but also in addition this is another way to get @xmath34 cleanly  @xcite .",
    "in fact whether one uses @xmath99 with dircp or @xmath101 with tdcp these methods are very clean with ( as indicated above ) the ite of @xmath102 . however , the tdcp studies for getting @xmath43 ( with the use of @xmath34 as determined from @xmath103 ) is less efficient than with the use of dircp involving @xmath99 .",
    "once we go to luminosities @xmath104 , though , the two methods for @xmath43 should become competitive . note that this method for getting @xmath34 is significantly less efficient than from the @xmath103 studies  @xcite .    0.1 in    ._projections for direct determination of ut .",

    "the new millennium marks the spectacular success of b - factories leading to a milestone in our understanding of cp - violation ; in particular , for the first time ckm paradigm of cp violation is quantitatively confirmed .",
    "direct measurement of @xmath105 by the b - factories agrees remarkably well with the theoretical expectation from the sm to about  10% .",
    "furthermore , first relatively crude _ direct _ determination of the other two angles ( @xmath53 & @xmath43 ) also are consistent with theoretical expectations .",
    "while these findings are good news for the sm , at the same ime , they imply that most likely the effect of bsm cp - odd phase on b - physics is likely to be a small perturbation .",
    "thus discovery of new bsm - cp - odd source(s ) of cp violation in b - physics is likely to require very large , clean , data samples and extremely clean predictions from theory .    for the search of such small deviations approximate null tests of the sm gain new prominence .    also important for this purpose",
    "is the drive to directly determine all three angles of the ut with highest precision possible , _",

    "it should be clear that to accomplish this important goal would require a super - b factory .    specifically regarding penguin - dominated hadronic fs , that have been much in the recent news , the current data does not show any convincing signal for deviation from the sm ; however , it is a very important and sensitive test for new physics and its of vital importance to reduce the experimental errors to o(5% ) ; for this purpose too a sbf may well be needed .",
