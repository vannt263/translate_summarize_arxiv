    "the dynamic packing of objects is an often overlooked variation on the theme of static packing . given a mechanism for the creation , growth , movement , and interaction of like objects in a given dimension , what structures",
    "result ? here , we find universal features of a simple yet broad class of such mechanisms falling under the rubric `` packing - limited growth '' ( plg ) .",
    "a plg mechanism entails objects being seeded randomly , growing according to a rule that may be specific to each object , and stopping when a part of their boundary hits that of another object .",
    "a motivating physical example of this kind of pattern formation may be found in the competition between tree crowns in dense forests  @xcite , the structure of porous media  @xcite , and the generalized problem of dense packings  @xcite .",
    "a simple model of plg has previously been studied by andrienko , brilliantov , and krapivsky  @xcite ( the abk model ) . in their setting , spheres are seeded randomly in space and time .",
    "a sphere s radius increases linearly with time , halting when another sphere is touched .",
    "this model is amenable to an approximate analysis for @xmath5  @xcite and has an exact solution in @xmath6 . in this present work ,",
    "we are interested in the limiting distribution of radii , @xmath7 . for plg models",
    ", we expect @xmath8 for small @xmath9 .",
    "note that the fractal dimension @xmath10 of the set comprising all sphere centers , which is often measured instead of @xmath11 , is related to @xmath11 as @xmath12  @xcite . in @xmath6 ,",
    "the exact solution gives @xmath13 , which corresponds to @xmath14 ( meaning the number of centers diverges logarithmically )  @xcite . for @xmath1 , andrienko _ et al . _",
    "@xcite report that @xmath15 and hence @xmath16 based on numerical evidence .",
    "elsewhere , the same authors  @xcite determine numerically that @xmath17 .",
    "we claim that the actual value of @xmath11 is essentially independent of the specifics of the growth dynamics . to see why",
    ", we examine a related @xmath1 random packing model due to manna  @xcite .",
    "the packing process begins in a finite - sized volume ( or alternatively with an initial population of fixed radius disks ) .",
    "new disks are added one at a time by randomly choosing a point in the packing s pore space and centering there the largest possible non - overlapping disk .",
    "manna finds @xmath18 and @xmath19 for two example packings .",
    "we refer to the manna model as `` random apollonian packing '' ( rap ) since it may be seen as a variation of the well known apollonian packing  @xcite . for the @xmath1 version of the latter , pore spaces",
    "are always formed by three disks each touching the other two and disks are added so as to fill the pore space fully ( i.e. , the inserted disk touches all three of its surrounding neighbors ) . numerics give @xmath20 for apollonian packing in agreement with analytically derived bounds  @xcite .",
    "aste  @xcite has shown for static polydisperse packings that are space filling , apollonian packing provides the lowest bound on @xmath11 while the upper bound is @xmath21 .",
    "there are two important observations to make here .",
    "first , as noted by brilliantov  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , the rap model is the abk model in the case of infinitely fast growth : as soon as a sphere is nucleated , it instantaneously expands to hit the nearest sphere boundary .",
    "second , for general plg models , pore spaces evidently increase in number and decrease in size with time .",
    "this means that the likelihood of two spheres nucleating in the same pore space also decreases .",
    "eventually the mechanism of the rap model must take over , and all collisions will be between a growing sphere in a pore space and a `` stuck '' sphere forming part of the pore space boundary .",
    "thus , the rap model is not just a curious end point of the abk model but , in fact , entails the sole mechanism describing how small radius spheres pack .",
    "we suggest then that measurements of @xmath11 in the abk model should coincide with revised estimates from simulations of the rap model . in the remainder of the paper",
    ", we describe a general class of plg models for which @xmath11 is invariant , provide a simple solution for the @xmath6 problem , develop a scaling theory that describes how the radii distribution and volume of pore space evolve with time , and provide results from extensive numerical simulations .",
    "for our general conception of plg we take @xmath0-dimensional spheres growing in a volume @xmath22 .",
    "spheres are nucleated randomly in space at a rate @xmath23 per unit volume surviving only if they are injected into the unoccupied pore space .",
    "all spheres stop growth upon contact with a neighboring sphere .",
    "figure  [ fig : manna.spindle ] provides a visual context for the dynamics explained below .",
    "the @xmath24th sphere , which is initiated at @xmath25 , grows at a rate @xmath26 giving the radius @xmath27 as @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "we assume the weak requirement that each sphere grows in a strict monotonic fashion , i.e. , for each @xmath24 , @xmath30 .",
    "the model is thus one of arbitrary individual growth limited solely by packing .",
    "the dynamics continue in the above fashion until the volume @xmath22 is completely filled and a final jammed state is reached .",
    "consider an individual pore @xmath31 of diameter @xmath32 ( i.e. , the maximum separation of two boundary points that can be joined by a line contained entirely within the pore ) .",
    "the rate @xmath33 at which spheres nucleate in @xmath31 ( excluding growth for the moment ) is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the volume of @xmath0-dimensional sphere of unit radius .",
    "the typical time @xmath36 between nucleations in @xmath31 is therefore @xmath37 on the other hand , if sphere @xmath24 nucleates in @xmath31 , it will jam in a time @xmath38 that can be no greater than the time it takes for its radius to reach @xmath39 .",
    "together with the assumption that @xmath30 , this gives @xmath40 so when @xmath41 , i.e. , when @xmath42 we expect the packing mechanism to be the same as the rap model  all spheres will be stopped by an existing stopped sphere and never by another moving sphere .",
    "growth rate therefore becomes irrelevant as far as the final packing is concerned . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : manna.tj2 ] ) , we see that the general model reduces to the rap model when the maximum pore size @xmath43 satisfies @xmath44 since @xmath43 steadily decreases with @xmath45 ( i.e. , space fills up ) this condition will always be eventually satisfied .",
    "as we have noted , the abk model has been solved exactly in the @xmath6 case  @xcite with the outcome being @xmath13 . here",
    ", we achieve the same result with a considerably simpler calculation .",
    "since we have posited that @xmath11 is a universal exponent for a general class of packing - limited growth models , we may choose the straightforward example of the @xmath6 rap model .",
    "we take the unit interval @xmath46 $ ] as the initial vacant pore space .",
    "spheres are now line segments and are limited either on the left or right as they are added with the points 0 and 1 providing initial boundaries .",
    "thus , the unit interval is filled in from each end with the one solitary pore space diminishing in the middle .",
    "writing the length of the @xmath47th line segment as @xmath48 we have @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a random number uniformly distributed on the unit interval and @xmath51 .",
    "in other words , each new line segment is a random fraction of the current pore space .",
    "iteratively solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : manna.ln+1 ] ) gives @xmath52 we can in principle find the distributions of the @xmath53 but for our present purposes their means are sufficient and we have @xmath54 we therefore expect the typical number of line segments with @xmath55 to be @xmath56 since this is the cumulative frequency distribution , i.e. , @xmath57 , we find the frequency distribution @xmath58 must behave as @xmath59 yielding , as expected , @xmath13 .",
    "we next investigate the form of @xmath60 , the probability distribution of the @xmath61th sphere s radius to be inserted into a packing .",
    "in addition , we characterize @xmath62 , the probability distribution of sphere radii after @xmath47 spheres have been packed . note",
    "that since we have shown that a general class of plg models reduce to the rap model , we now use the number of spheres @xmath47 rather than time @xmath45 to index our quantities .",
    "we first note that the distribution @xmath63 fills in from the right with increasing @xmath47 . as the packing fills in space , the maximum pore size either decreases or does not change and so does the maximum size of any sphere that may be added .",
    "we write the radius of this largest sphere as @xmath64 .",
    "we observe that to a first approximation , @xmath63 above this cutoff scale @xmath64 follows its limiting power law form while below the distribution it is essentially flat ( see fig .  [ fig : manna.pinsert ] ) .",
    "for the purposes of estimation , we assume this form exactly as @xmath65 the corresponding frequency distribution is @xmath66 .",
    "since the tail of @xmath67 remains fixed as @xmath47 increases , we can obtain the scaling of @xmath64 with @xmath47 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : manna.prn ] ) , the tail of @xmath67 behaves as @xmath68 for @xmath69 .",
    "since the prefactor @xmath70 must be constant , we have @xmath71    the uniformity of @xmath63 for @xmath72 closely relates to the form of @xmath60 .",
    "it is possible to write down an exact expression for @xmath60 , that is , @xmath73 where the integrals are over the pore space , and @xmath74 is the distance from the point @xmath75 to the closest pore space boundary after @xmath47 spheres have been inserted .",
    "this integral may be solved exactly in the limit of very small radii , @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the surface area and available pore space of the existing @xmath47 packed spheres .",
    "this means that the region of pore space available for insertion of an infinitesimal sphere is proportional to the surface area of the extant packing . assuming that this holds approximately for all spheres below the cutoff , the full distribution @xmath60 may be modeled as a purely flat distribution , @xmath79 good agreement with this approximation is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : manna.pinsert ] . comparing eq .",
    "( [ eq : manna.pins_exact2 ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ eq : manna.pins ] ) , we see that @xmath80 .",
    "we calculate @xmath77 and @xmath78 using @xmath67 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 where as before @xmath35 is the volume of a unit radius sphere in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "note that @xmath83 and @xmath84 as @xmath85 .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : manna.s(n ) ] ) and  ( [ eq : manna.phi(n ) ] ) , and the result @xmath80 , we find an estimate of @xmath11 as @xmath86 in contrast , a modified calculation for the abk model finds  @xcite @xmath87\\right).\\ ] ] note that @xmath88 must be an upper bound on the true value of @xmath11 for normal apollonian packing .",
    "furthermore , due to the nature of the approximations made in forming @xmath60 and @xmath63 , @xmath88 is also an upper bound for the exponent of the rap model . as we show in the following section when we consider our numerical results , both of these predictions of @xmath11 appear to hold for certain ( mutually exclusive ) ranges of @xmath0 .    using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : manna.rcn ] ) , ( [ eq : manna.s(n ) ] ) , and  ( [ eq : manna.phi(n ) ] ) , we are able to find the scalings of surface area and pore space volume with @xmath47 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 these relations provide us with further methods for determining @xmath11 and for testing scaling relations between the iterative and structural nature of the packing .",
    "equation  [ eq : manna.phi(n)scaling ] , in particular , affords a more robust measurement than does obtaining @xmath11 directly from @xmath63 , and we employ this fact in our numerical investigations .",
    "note that for comparison between the current theory and that of abk we must convert scaling predictions that depend on time to those that depend on sphere number .",
    "specifically , the abk theory predicts @xmath91 where @xmath92 $ ] . because the abk model can be seen as an rap model with infinite growth velocity , the time between events is inversely proportional to the pore space available ( given a uniform rate for attempted nucleation @xmath93 ) .",
    "so the result for the decay of pore space from abk may be rewritten as @xmath94 , where @xmath95 this implies that @xmath96 .",
    "so if abk predicts @xmath91 , this is equivalent to writing @xmath97 . equating the two forms leads to the conclusion that @xmath98 this will be useful in the following section when the scaling of pore space decay is examined .",
    "finally , key scaling relations are summarized in table  [ tab : manna.scaling ] .",

    "spheres are seeded according to a poisson distribution , with rate @xmath23 and only grow within the pore space .",
    "once injected , spheres grow according to model rules ( linear velocity , heterogeneous , exponential , etc . ) until they collide and are jammed . in the case of the rap model , only one sphere is allowed to nucleate and expand at any given point in the simulation . using this event driven procedure we are able to calculate limiting states and determine improved estimates of the universal value of @xmath11 for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
