    "our focus lies on rough geometric configurations even beyond the lipschitz class .",
    "so , we assume that @xmath25 is @xmath26-ahlfors regular , that @xmath27 satisfies the ahlfors - david condition , and only around the neumann part of the boundary we require lipschitz coordinate charts .",
    "let us stress that the pure dirichlet case @xmath28 and the pure neumann case @xmath29 are not excluded from our considerations .",
    "our goal is to classify all weak solutions @xmath30 to these equations that satisfy appropriate interior estimates of @xmath31 , such as a square - integrable modified non - tangential maximal function or lusin area bounds .",

    "@xmath0 may depend on all variables , these boundary value problems are not always solvable in general unless some additional regularity in @xmath33-direction is imposed , see @xcite for counterexamples and further background . following the treatment in @xcite ,",
    "we use the modified carleson norm @xmath34 originating from the work of dahlberg @xcite as a fair means to measure the size of perturbations of @xmath0 from the class of @xmath33-independent coefficients @xmath1 .    assuming finiteness of @xmath35 , we prove _ a priori _ estimates and representation formulas for all weak solutions with non - tangential maximal function estimates @xmath36 or lusin area bounds @xmath37 . here , @xmath38 is a modified non - tangential maximal function taking @xmath2-averages over truncated cones .",
    "ever since the famous work of kenig and pipher @xcite , the @xmath2-bound for @xmath39 is considered a natural interior estimate for the neumann and regularity problem . given our method , the lusin area bound is most natural for the dirichlet problem but we show that any such solution satisfies @xmath40 as well .",
    "moreover , we prove that any solution with non - tangential maximal bound and lusin area bound attains a trace @xmath41 and @xmath42 on @xmath43 , respectively , in the sense of almost everywhere convergence of whitney averages .",
    "next , assuming smallness of @xmath35 and that @xmath1 is either hermitean or a block matrix ( no mixed derivatives @xmath44 occur ) , we obtain well - posedness of the inhomogeneous boundary value problems .",
    "for a precise formulation of our main results we refer to section  [ sec : main results ] .",
    "we remark that these results match the status quo for elliptic systems with @xmath2 boundary data on the upper half space @xmath45 .",
    "modern theory for real equations on the upper half space , that is , when @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , dates back to dahlberg @xcite , who was first to solve the dirichlet problem for @xmath49 on a lipschitz domain with boundary data @xmath50 . for such equations",
    "the picture is rather complete by now , see @xcite just to mention a few .",
    "all of these results heavily build on real - variable techniques , such as maximum principles and harmonic measures , which for equations with complex coefficients ( let alone coupled systems of such ) are not available anymore .    in this paper",
    ", we follow a completely different approach that has been proposed and developed to full strength in a series of papers by axelsson , m^c^intosh , and the first author @xcite and which works equally well for real equations and systems , see also @xcite for related results . to date , this so - called @xmath51-approach as only been followed for systems on the upper half - space or the unit ball @xcite .",
    "much more challenging geometric configurations , such as a cylinder with a rough base bear new and interesting challenges arising from the lateral boundary conditions .",
    "these have  at least to our knowledge  not been addressed before .",
    "the general idea is to reformulate the second - order system for @xmath30 as a first - order system for the conormal gradient @xmath52 of @xmath30 , a vector formed of the conormal derivative and the tangential gradient at each interior point , see section  [ sec : equivalence of es to a first order system ] for definitions .",
    "the first - order system for @xmath52 then has the form of a non - autonomous evolution equation @xmath53 for @xmath54 a first - order self - adjoint operator acting on the tangential variables and @xmath55 a bounded accretive multiplication operator .",
    "the lateral boundary conditions are hidden in the domain of @xmath54 . having rephrased as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is independent of @xmath33 and corresponds to a @xmath33-independent coefficient tensor @xmath1 just in the same manner as @xmath58 corresponds to @xmath0 , it is tempting to solve by the semigroup formula @xmath59 if @xmath60 and then use maximal regularity methods to obtain @xmath52 via a duhamel formula in the general case .",
    "however , since @xmath61 will have positive and negative spectrum , the underlying evolution for @xmath52 will be forward on one part of @xmath2 and backward on another part . in order to master the situation , we have to split @xmath2 into spectral subspaces .    in section  [ sec : quadratic estimates for db0 ]",
    "we establish boundedness of the spectral projections @xmath62 , which is a highly delicate matter in general and would not have been available before the resolution of the kato square root problem for elliptic systems with mixed boundary conditions acting on the cylinder base @xmath25 only @xcite . in section  [ sec :",
    "semigroup solutions to the first order equation ] , which lies at the heart of this article , we present a careful analysis of the semigroup solutions @xmath59 to the first - order system for @xmath60 .",
    "in particular , we identify them as elements of the natural solution spaces and prove whitney average convergence as @xmath63 toward the data @xmath64 .    as for the extension to @xmath33-dependent coefficients with modified carleson control , we can rely on the maximal regularity estimates for elliptic systems on the upper half space due to rosn and the first author @xcite , which are mostly formulated on abstract function spaces and",
    "therefore hold for our setup as well .",
    "hence , we shall be rather brief here and suggest to keep a copy of @xcite handy as duplicated arguments will be omitted . additionally , we will prove almost everywhere convergence of whitney averages of solutions , which was left as an open problem in @xcite and was partly resolved in @xcite .",
    "the so - obtained _ a priori _ estimates for weak solutions to @xmath33-dependent systems are presented in section  [ sec : representation of solutions ] . in the special case of @xmath33-independent coefficients",
    "@xmath65 , they entail that the semigroup solutions investigated in section  [ sec : semigroup solutions to the first order equation ] are the only solutions to the first - order system @xmath66 satisfying the respective interior estimates on @xmath5 .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : well - posedness ] we prove well - posedness of the three boundary problems for @xmath33-independent coefficients @xmath1 that are either hermitean , of block form , or sufficiently close to one of these classes in the @xmath67-topology . we also show that this result is stable under @xmath33-dependent perturbations @xmath0 satisfying a smallness condition on @xmath68 .    of course , weak solutions to the elliptic system with mixed lateral boundary conditions can also be constructed using the lax - milgram lemma , provided there is an interior control @xmath69 and that the data at @xmath70 is contained in the appropriate trace spaces .",
    "if @xmath65 , then uniqueness of these lax - milgram solutions entails that their conormal gradient follows a semigroup flow as well .",
    "the difference to the methods we present in this paper is that our semigroup representation really is an _ a priori _ result obtained independently of any solvability issues .",
