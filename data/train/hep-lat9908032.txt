    "experimental candidates for bound states of four quarks ( of which two are antiquarks ) lie close to meson - antimeson thresholds . in our case",
    "e.g. a heavy @xmath1 particle could be a @xmath2 system .",
    "systems with heavy quarks should be more easily bound as the repulsive kinetic energy is smaller with the attractive potential being flavour independent .",
    "the binding of four - quark systems has been studied e.g. in bag , string - flip and deuson models , states with two @xmath3 quarks being stable in most models .    in the lattice calculation",
    "we measure two diagrams for both meson - meson and meson - antimeson cases  see fig . 1 .",
    "one of them is the unconnected one without light quark interchange and the other connected , where the light quarks hop from one meson to another .",
    "the light quark mass we use is approximately that of @xmath4 . because of the static approximation for the heavy quarks their spin and isospin decouples making the pseudoscalar @xmath5 and the vector @xmath6 degenerate , while physically they have a 46 mev ( 1% ) separation .",
    "we call this degenerate set @xmath7 . for",
    "the two - meson system combinations of @xmath5 and @xmath6 do have different energies in our case .",
    "we measure wavefunctions symmetric under interchange of the mesons with the light quark spin and isospin being singlet or triplet ; these then couple to @xmath8 combinations  @xcite .",
    "we obtain estimates of light quark propagators using maximally variance reduced pseudo - fermionic ensembles  @xcite , 24 of which are generated for each gauge configuration . a second nested monte carlo calculation",
    "is then performed for the pseudofermions of each gauge configuration .",
    "the variance reduction requires `` halving '' of the lattice into two separate regions with the propagators going from one region to the other .",
    "thus the connected diagram for @xmath9 and the cross correlator between @xmath10 and @xmath9 need to have one of the normally spatial axes as the temporal axis , introducing considerable technical complications .",
    "the parameters of our calculation are @xmath11 for unquenched  @xcite and @xmath12 for the quenched case with a @xmath13 lattice being used for both .",
    "we have 20 and 54 gauge configurations for quenched and unquenched respectively ; with pseudofermionic fields these take some 60 gb of diskspace . a variational basis of local and fuzzed mesonic operators",
    "is used , diagonalization of which maximizes overlap with the ground state of the system .",
    "we measure the different spin and isospin components as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the @xmath9 case",
    "@xmath14 has only the unconnected diagram , whereas @xmath0 has the connected one subtracted .",
    "the raw correlators show that for the @xmath15 system the unconnected diagram is much noisier and does not contribute to the binding at @xmath16 .",
    "the connected diagram , on the other hand , gives a small binding for larger @xmath17 and also contributes to the observables where the spin of the light quarks changes .    at @xmath18",
    "the heavy quarks are at the same point and the @xmath15 case looks like a baryon with an antitriplet string . we can compare to previously measured  @xcite energies of the @xmath19 baryons for @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively , finding excellent agreement  @xcite .",
    "states with a sextet string @xmath22 lie higher .",
    "the @xmath9 singlet at @xmath18 looks like a pion , and we find agreement with the energy of a pion with non - zero momentum .",
    "the meson - meson potentials are shown in fig .",
    "the @xmath23 case is similar to @xmath24 but less bound ; the level ordering observed at @xmath18 is retained and the attraction disappears earlier . for the @xmath25 a remnant of the sextet string makes the small-@xmath17 potential repulsive .",
    "the @xmath26 at @xmath18 is attractive for unquenched and repulsive for quenched ; this is the only qualitative ( @xmath27 ) difference between the quenched and unquenched results visible in our data .",
    "both @xmath26 and @xmath25 seem to have attraction at @xmath28 fm , which is a meson exchange effect as opposed to the small distance behaviour governed by gluonic effects . from a crude two - body schrdinger approach using these potentials",
    "we expect binding for all of these cases except perhaps @xmath25 .    the meson - antimeson potential for @xmath29 is shown in fig .",
    "3 , the @xmath30 case being similar . for both of these a @xmath31 state with the same quantum number is lighter for small @xmath17 . for @xmath32",
    "the relevant energies are @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively , where @xmath35 is the static @xmath10 potential .",
    "an estimate of @xmath33 is included in fig .",
    "the contribution from meson exchange can be examined e.g. by looking at the crossed diagram measured in the quenched approximation at fixed @xmath36 as a function of @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath37 case should have a contribution from @xmath38 exchange , and we indeed find agreement by using the previously measured @xmath39 and normalizing by hand . for @xmath40 we should have a contribution from @xmath41 exchange . in this case",
    "we can use a recent determination of the @xmath42 coupling  @xcite , the experimental decay constant and our @xmath43 . in the one-@xmath41 exchange formula everything is thus known , and we find excellent quantitative agreement for @xmath44 fm .",
    "this is strong support for deuson models  @xcite in this distance range .",
    "in our quenched and unquenched calculations the ground state @xmath9 and @xmath10 potentials cross at @xmath45 fm .",
    "we are investigating the breaking of the @xmath10 string by using a variational approach similar to that used in higgs models by several groups .",
    "the cross correlator between two - meson and two - quark states allows us to study their mixing also in the quenched theory  in the unquenched case additional fermion bubbles induce corrections .",
    "the quenched mixing matrix element can then be used to estimate the splitting of energy levels at the string breaking point , even though no actual splitting occurs with quenching . with an unquenched calculation",
    "the energy splitting can be studied directly using the full variational approach .",
    "one might think that an excited string would break at a smaller distance than the ground state .",
    "this is not necessarily the case , as e.g. the first excited state has @xmath46 with quark separation along @xmath47 and only breaks into mesons @xmath48 with @xmath49 . in general",
    "it is an open question if a state with particular quantum numbers has the lowest energy at a particular heavy quark separation as a ) a hybrid @xmath10 meson with excited glue , b ) a ground state @xmath10 meson and a @xmath50 meson or c ) two heavy - light mesons .",
    "these energy levels and their mixing can be studied on the lattice with our techniques ."
