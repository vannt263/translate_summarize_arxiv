    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) involve the most powerful , steady sources of luminosity in the universe .",
    "it is believed that the center core of agn consist of super massive black hole ( smbh ) surrounded by an accretion disk . in some cases",
    "powerful collimated jets are found in agn , perpendicular to the plane of accretion disk .",
    "the origin of jets are still unclear .",
    "agns whose jets are viewed at a small angle to its axis are called blazars .    the overall ( radio to @xmath4-ray ) spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars shows two broad non - thermal continuum peaks .",
    "the low - energy peak is thought to arise from electron synchrotron emission .",
    "the leptonic model suggests that the second peak forms due to inverse compton emission .",
    "this can be due to upscattering , by the same non - thermal population of electrons responsible for the synchrotron radiation , and synchrotron photons ( synchrotron self compton : ssc )  @xcite .",
    "blazars often show violent flux variability , that may or may not appear correlated in the different energy bands .",
    "simultaneous observation are then crucial to understand the physics behind variability .",
    "in this section we discuss the code that we have used to obtain an estimation of the characteristic parameters of the ssc model .",
    "the ssc model assumes a spectrum for the accelerated electron density @xmath5 , which is a broken power law with exponents @xmath6 and @xmath7 . the minimum , maximum and break lorentz factors for the electrons are usually called @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "the emitting region is considered to be a blob of radius @xmath11 moving with doppler factor @xmath3 with respect to the observer in a magnetic field of intensity @xmath1 .",
    "the model is thus characterized by nine free parameters .    ' '' ''    @xmath12    ' '' ''    in the present work we have kept @xmath8 fixed and equal to unit , which is a satisfactory approximation already used in the literature .",
    "the determination of the remaining eight parameters has been performed by finding their best values and uncertainties from a @xmath13 minimization in which multi - frequency experimental points have been fitted to the ssc spectrum modelled as in @xcite .",
    "minimization has been performed using the levenberg - marquardt method @xcite , which is an efficient standard for non - linear least - squares minimization that smoothly interpolates between two different minimization approaches , namely the inverse hessian method and the steepest descent method . for completeness",
    ", we briefly present the pseudo - code for the algorithm in table i.    a crucial point in our implementation is that from @xcite we can only obtain a numerical approximation to the ssc spectrum , in the form of a sampled sed . on the other hand , from table i",
    ", we understand that at each step the calculation of the @xmath14 requires the evaluation of the sed for all the observed frequencies .",
    "although an observed point will likely not be one of the sampled points coming from @xcite , it will fall between two sampled points , so that interpolation can be used to approximate the value of the sed .",
    "at the same time , the levenberg - marquardt method requires the calculation of the partial derivatives of @xmath14 with respect to the ssc parameters .",
    "these derivatives have also been obtained numerically by evaluating the incremental ratio of the @xmath14 with respect to a sufficiently small , dynamically adjusted increment of each parameter .",
    "this method could have introduced a potential inefficiency in the computation , due to the recurrent need to evaluate the sed at many , slightly different points in parameter space , this being the most demanding operation in terms of cpu time .",
    "for this reason we set up the algorithm to minimize the number of calls to @xcite across different iterations .",
    "the @xmath0 fit during different iterations are shown in fig.1 .",
    ".data sets used in this study .",
    "the observation period of each state can be found at fig.2 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ l2ea4-t1 ]",
    "in order to study the behavior of parameters with source activity , we choose mrk421 ( table ii ) , considering the larger availability of mwl data sets and the lower redshift , hence less uncertainty after ebl correction of vhe data .",
    "the @xmath0 fitted seds are shown in fig.2 .",
    "in addition to the @xmath0 test , we also checked the goodness of the fit using the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test . considering the occurrence of different physical processes ( synchrotron and inverse compton , at substantially different energies ) , and the different quality of low- and high - energy data",
    ", we used a _",
    "piecewise ks test _ , _ i.e. _ we applied the ks test separately to low- and high - energy data .",
    "then the ks test always confirms that the fit residuals are normal at 5% confidence level .",
    "our results suggest that in mkn421 , @xmath1 decreases with source activity whereas @xmath15 and @xmath3 increase ( fig.3 top ) .",
    "this can be interpreted in a frame where the synchrotron power and peak frequency remain constant with varying source activity by decreasing magnetic field and increasing the number of low energy electrons .",
    "this mechanism results in an increased electron - photon scattering efficiency and hence in an increased compton power .",
    "other emission parameters appear uncorrelated with source activity . in fig.3 ( bottom ) , the @xmath1-@xmath15 anti - correlation results from a roughly constant synchrotron peak frequency .",
    "the @xmath1-@xmath3 correlation suggests that the compton emission of mkn421 is always in the thomson limit .",
    "the @xmath3-@xmath15 correlation is an effect of the constant synchrotron and compton frequencies of the radiation emitted by a plasma in bulk relativistic motion towards the observer ."
