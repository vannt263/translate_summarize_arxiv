    "in the proper understanding of on - going redshift surveys of galaxies and quasars , in particular the two - degree field ( 2df ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , it is essential to establish a theory of cosmological statistics on the light cone .",
    "this project has been undertaken in a series of our previous papers ( matsubara , suto , & szapudi 1997 ; yamamoto & suto 1999 ; nishioka & yamamoto 1999 ; suto et  al .",
    "1999 ; yamamoto , nishioka , & suto 2000 ; suto , magira & yamamoto 2000 ) .",
    "those papers have formulated the light - cone statistics in a rigorous manner , described approximations to model the clustering evolution in the redshift space , and presented various predictions in canonical cold dark matter ( cdm ) universes .",
    "their predictions , however , have not yet been tested quantitatively , for instance , against numerical simulations .",
    "this is not surprising since it is fairly a demanding task to construct a reliable sample extending over the light - cone from the conventional simulation outputs at a specified redshift , @xmath4 .    in the present paper , we examine , for the first time , the validity and limitation of the above theoretical framework to describe the cosmological light - cone effect against the mock catalogues on the light - cone .",
    "such catalogues from cosmological @xmath5-body simulations have been originally constructed for the study of the weak lensing statistics ( hamana et al .",
    "2000 , in preparation ) .",
    "applying the same technique (  [ subsec : lcfromnbody ] ) , we generate a number of different realizations for the light - cone samples up to @xmath0 and @xmath1 , evaluate the two - point correlation functions directly , and compare with the theoretical predictions .",
    "in order to predict quantitatively the two - point statistics of objects on the light cone , one must take account of ( i ) nonlinear gravitational evolution , ( ii ) linear redshift - space distortion , ( iii ) nonlinear redshift - space distortion , ( iv ) weighted averaging over the light - cone , ( v ) cosmological redshift - space distortion due to the geometry of the universe , and ( vi ) object - dependent clustering bias . the effect ( v ) comes from our ignorance of the correct cosmological parameters , and ( vi ) is rather sensitive to the objects which one has in mind .",
    "thus the latter two effects will be discussed in a separate paper , and we focus on the effects of ( i ) @xmath6 ( iv ) throughout the present paper .",
    "nonlinear gravitational evolution of mass density fluctuations is now well understood , at least for two - point statistics . in practice",
    ", we adopt an accurate fitting formula ( peacock & dodds 1996 ) for the nonlinear power spectrum @xmath7 in terms of its linear counterpart .    then the nonlinear power spectrum in redshift space",

    "the second factor in the right - hand - side comes from the linear redshift - space distortion ( kaiser 1987 ) , and the last factor is a phenomenological correction for non - linear velocity effect . in the above , we introduce @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the gravitational growth rate of the linear density fluctuations , @xmath13 is the cosmic scale factor , and the density parameter , the cosmological constant , and the hubble parameter at redshift @xmath4 are related to their present values respectively as @xmath14 ^ 2 \\ , ( 1+z)^3 \\omega_0 , \\\\",

    "their cosmological parameters are listed in table [ tab : parameters ] . while scdm are known to have several problems in reproducing the recent observations ( e.g. , de bernardis et al . 2000 ) , this model is suitable for testing the theoretical formula since the clustering evolution on the light - cone is more significant .",
    "we use a series of @xmath5-body simulations originally constructed for the study of weak lensing statistics ( hamana et al .",
    "2000 , in preparation ) .",
    "these simulations were generated with a vectorized pm code ( moutarde at al .",

    "= 8.4 cm    using the above simulation data , we generated light - cone samples as follows ; first , we adopt a distance observer approximation and assume that the line - of - sight direction is parallel to @xmath55-axis regardless with its @xmath56 position ( fig.[fig : lightcone ] ) .",
    "second , we periodically duplicate the simulation box along the @xmath55-direction so that at a redshift @xmath4 , the position and velocity of those particles locating within an interval @xmath57 are dumped , where @xmath58 is determined by the output time - interval of the original @xmath5-body simulation .",
    "finally we extract five independent ( non - overlapping ) cone - shape samples with the angular radius of 1 degree ( the field - of - view of @xmath2 degree@xmath3 ) , each for small and large boxes as illustrated in figure [ fig : lightcone ] .",
    "in this manner , we have generated mock data samples on the light - cone continuously extending up to @xmath0 ( relevant for galaxy samples ) and @xmath59 ( relevant for qso samples ) , respectively from the small and large boxes .",
    "while the above procedure selects the same particle at several different redshifts , this does not affect our conclusion below because we are mainly interested in scales much below the box size along the @xmath55-direction , @xmath60 .    in practice",
    ", we apply the above procedure separately in real and redshift spaces by using @xmath61 and @xmath62 of each particle ( see eq.[[eq : zobs ] ] below ) .",
    "the total numbers of particles in those realizations are listed in table [ tab : particlenumber ] .",
    "two - point correlation function is estimated by the conventional pair - count adopting the estimator proposed by landy & szalay ( 1993 ) : @xmath63 for this purpose , we distribute the same number of particles over the light - cone in a completely random fashion .",
    "when the number of particles in a realization exceeds @xmath64 , we randomly select 10,000 particles as center particles in counting the pairs .",

    "we do not introduce the spatial biasing between selected particles and the underlying dark matter , which will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "for comparison , we also select the similar number of particles randomly but independently of their redshifts . it should be emphasized here that our simulated data are constructed to match the _ shape _ of the above selection functions but _ not _ the amplitudes of the number densities . the field - of - view of our simulated data , @xmath2 degree@xmath3 , is substantially smaller than those of 2df and sdss , and we sample particles much more densely than the realistic number density . since our main purpose of this paper is to test the reliability of the theoretical modeling described in section 2 , and _ not _ to present detailed predictions , this does not change our conclusions below .",
    "the numbers of the selected particles in each realization are listed in table [ tab : particlenumber ] .",
    "the averaged _ selection functions _ for our five realizations in real space are plotted as histograms in figures [ fig : galselfunc ] and [ fig : qsoselfunc ] .",
    "consider first the two - point correlation functions for particles on the light cone but without redshift - dependent selection .",
    "figures [ fig : xilc_mass ] and [ fig : xilc_mass_lcdm ] plot those correlations for @xmath103 samples from small - box simulations ( upper panels ) and for @xmath104 from large - box ones ( lower panels ) , for scdm and @xmath22cdm , respectively . in these figure , we plot the averages over the five realizations ( table [ tab : particlenumber ] ) in open circles ( real space ) and in solid triangles ( redshift space ) , and the quoted error - bars represent the standard deviation among them .",
    "if we use all particles from simulations ( left panels ) , the agreement between the theoretical predictions ( solid lines ) and simulations ( symbols ) is quite good .",
    "the scales where the simulation data in real space become smaller than the corresponding theoretical predictions simply reflect the force resolution of the simulations listed in table [ tab : parameters ] .    in order to examine the robustness of the estimates from the simulated data",
    ", we randomly selected @xmath105 particles from the entire light - cone volume ( independently of their redshifts ) .",
    "the resulting correlation functions are plotted in the right panels .",
    "it is remarkable that the estimates on scales larger than @xmath106 are almost the same .",
    "this also indicates that the error - bars in our data are dominated by the sample - to - sample variation among the different realizations .",
    "next we examine the effect of selection functions .",
    "figures [ fig : xilc_phi ] and [ fig : xilc_phi_lcdm ] plot the two - point correlation functions in scdm and @xmath22cdm , respectively , taking account of the selection functions described in the subsection 3.3 .",
    "it is clear that the simulation results and the predictions are in good agreement .",
    "it should be noted that the results shown in the upper - left panel ( intended to correspond to _ galaxies _ ) have substantially larger error - bars compared with the corresponding ones in figures [ fig : xilc_mass ] and [ fig : xilc_mass_lcdm ] .",
    "this is an artifact to some extent because of the very small survey volume in our light - cone samples ; if one applies the galaxy selection function which rapidly decreases as @xmath4 ( see , fig.[fig : galselfunc ] ) , the resulting structure mainly probes the universe at @xmath107 and thus large - scale nonlinearity or variation for the different line - of - sight becomes significant .",
    "if we are able to use the same number of particles but extending over the much larger volume , the sample - to - sample variations should be substantially smaller .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the upper - right panel where we randomly sample @xmath108 particles from those used in the upper - left panel .",
    "despite the fact that the number of particles is only 5% ( 20% ) of the original one for scdm ( @xmath22cdm ) model , the resulting correlation functions and their error - bars remain almost unchanged .",
    "the lower panels corresponding to _ qsos _ show the similar trend .",
    "we have presented detailed comparison between the theoretical modeling and the direct numerical results of the two - point correlation functions on the light - cone . in short ,",
    "we have quantitatively shown that the previous theoretical models by yamamoto & suto ( 1999 ) and yamamoto , nishioka & suto ( 1999 ) are quite accurate on scales @xmath109 where the numerical simulations are reliable .",
    "it is also encouraging that this conclusion remains true even for the particle number of around @xmath110 .",
    "in fact , the error - bars in our estimates of the two - point correlation functions are dominated by the sample - to - sample variance due to the limited angular - size ( @xmath2-degree@xmath3 ) and thus the limited volume .    in order for the more realistic evaluation of the statistical and systematic uncertainties",
    ", one needs mock light - cone data samples with a much wider sky coverage .",
    "more importantly such datasets enable one to access the effect of biasing on the two - point correlation functions on the light - cone . since our present study indicated that all the physical effects except for the biasing are well described by the existing theoretical models , it is very interesting to examine in detail how to extract the effect of the galaxy / qso biasing from the upcoming redshift survey on the basis of the above mock samples .",
    "we plan to come back to these issues with larger simulation datasets in near future .",
    "this research was supported in part by the direction de la recherche du ministre franais de la recherche and the grant - in - aid by the ministry of education , science , sports and culture of japan ( 07ce2002 ) to resceu .",
