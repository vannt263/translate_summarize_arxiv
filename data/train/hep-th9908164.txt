    "the vacuum equations for yang - mills theories on a 3torus with periodic boundary conditions , @xmath7 , always allow a trivial solution where the @xmath8 are constant matrices in the cartan subalgebra ( csa ) of the gauge group @xmath9 . in @xmath10",
    "supersymmetric yang - mills theories , the solutions of the vacuum equations are of relevance for the computation of the witten index @xmath11 @xcite ( which in this case is equal to the number of quantum vacua ) . with the theory formulated on @xmath0 , and assuming that all solutions for the gauge field are of the trivial form , witten found @xmath12 , with @xmath13 the rank of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "when formulated on @xmath14 , the theory has a @xmath15 chiral symmetry , broken to @xmath16 by instantons ( with @xmath17 the dual coxeter number of @xmath9 ) , and further to @xmath18 by gluino condensation , leaving @xmath17 degenerate vacua @xcite .",
    "hence , one finds @xmath19 .",
    "witten s index is assumed to be an invariant , so @xmath17 should equal @xmath20 .",
    "this is the case for @xmath21 and @xmath22 , but not for orthogonal or exceptional gauge groups .",
    "the paradox was recently resolved , when it was shown that theories with orthogonal or exceptional gauge groups on a 3torus , admit non - trivial solutions to the vacuum equations for the gauge fields @xcite . taking these extra solutions into account one",
    "finds @xcite @xmath23 where the summation runs over all components of the moduli space , and @xmath24 is the rank of the unbroken gauge group on component @xmath25 . for theories with @xmath26 or @xmath22 ,",
    "the moduli space consists of only one component of trivial solutions .",
    "a flat connection on @xmath27 is completely characterised by 3 holonomies ( wilson loops ) around the non - trivial cycles of the torus : @xmath28 periodic boundary conditions mean that these commute in a simply connected representation of the gauge group @xmath9 . henceforth we will assume @xmath9 to be simply connected ( as well as simple ) .",
    "constructing a flat connection is therefore equivalent to finding 3 commuting elements in the group @xmath9 . an obvious way to solve",
    "this is to exponentiate 3 elements of the csa ( this corresponds to a trivial flat connection ) .",
    "a new situation occurs if one picks a group element @xmath29 as holonomy that has a non - simply connected centraliser @xmath30 .",
    "there are now two options for the remaining two holonomies : when lifted to a simply connected covering @xmath31 of @xmath30 , they either commute , or they commute up to a non - trivial element @xmath32 of the centre of @xmath31 , which is a lift of the identity of @xmath30",
    ". the first case is , up to conjugation , equivalent to the trivial case .",
    "the second case is different . on the subtorus spanned by the 2 and 3-direction",
    ", one has a case of t hooft s twisted boundary conditions @xcite in the gauge group @xmath30 .",
    "the subgroup of @xmath9 commuting with all three holonomies has a rank that is less than or equal to the rank of @xmath9 .",
    "having found a set of commuting holonomies , one can find a component of the moduli space by deforming around the solution while requiring the holonomies to commute .",
    "the rank of the unbroken group is constant over a component of moduli space , and if solutions of different rank are found , the moduli space should consist of different disconnected components .",
    ", height=113 ]    as an example consider the smallest exceptional group @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath33-algebra has an @xmath34 subalgebra , as is clear from the root diagram .",
    "less immediate from the root diagram is that this is the algebra of an @xmath35 subgroup of @xmath2 ( the @xmath18 is diagonal in the @xmath36 covering ) .",
    "this subgroup is non - simply connected , independent of the @xmath2 representation . as a first holonomy one picks the non - trivial centre element of @xmath37",
    "this is an element of @xmath2 which has @xmath37 as its centraliser . for the remaining two holonomies",
    "pick elements in the @xmath36 covering of @xmath37 that commute up to the non - trivial element of the diagonal @xmath18 , and project them to @xmath37 .",
    "this gives 3 commuting elements of @xmath2 .",
    "the centraliser of these holonomies is a discrete group .",
    "hence this solution is on a different component of the moduli space than the trivial one .",
    "it can not be perturbed , therefore this component of moduli space is an isolated point .",
    "all solutions to the vacuum equations are either conjugate to this non - trivial one , or to a trivial one , hence the moduli space of flat @xmath2-connections on @xmath27 consists of 2 components @xcite .",
    "the results for all simple gauge groups are summarised in a table .",
    "c c c | c c c@xmath9 & @xmath17 & @xmath24 & @xmath9 & @xmath17 & @xmath24 + @xmath21 & @xmath38 & @xmath39 & @xmath2 & 4 & 2,0 + @xmath22 & @xmath40 & @xmath38 & @xmath3 & 9 & 4,0,1,0 + @xmath41 & @xmath42 & @xmath38 , @xmath43 & @xmath4 & 12 & 6,0,2,0 + @xmath44 & @xmath45 & @xmath38 , @xmath46 & @xmath5 & 18 & 7,0,1,3,1,0 + & & & @xmath6 & 30 & 8,0,0,1,2,0,4,0,2,1,0,0 +    for orthogonal groups @xmath1 ( or rather the @xmath47-groups , their simply connected coverings ) the moduli space also consists of two components , but for @xmath48 the second component is no longer discrete @xcite . for the remaining exceptional groups",
    "the moduli space consists of even more components . via embedding of @xmath2 in these groups",
    "a second component of the moduli space can be constructed . @xmath3 and @xmath4 have an @xmath49 subgroup ( @xmath50 for @xmath3 resp .",
    "@xmath4 ) which allows two non - conjugate non - trivial solutions to be constructed .",
    "this brings the number of components for @xmath3 and @xmath4 to 4 .",
    "the groups @xmath5 and @xmath6 allow still more solutions , as described in @xcite . in each case equation [ cox ] is satisfied . in the table ,",
    "the components are ordered in a way that exhibits the `` clockwise symmetry '' of @xcite .",
    "the results for @xmath27 can be embedded in any @xmath51-torus with @xmath52 . for sufficiently big orthogonal groups , and",
    "the exceptional groups @xmath6 also new possibilities occur on higher dimensional tori @xcite .",
    "a full classification has not yet been done for these cases .",
    "the new solutions , in particular those for the @xmath53 and @xmath6-groups , are of relevance for toroidal compactification of the heterotic and type i string - theories @xcite . the disconnectedness of the moduli space , and the rank reduction show that they are not contained in the narain - compactification scheme @xcite .",
    "this is because narain - compactification assumes wilson lines with gauge fields taking values in the csa , and the results presented here show that this is not exhaustive .",
    "the models constructed with new solutions for the gauge fields are similar to the chl - models @xcite , but allow other possibilities for the reduction of the rank of the gauge group @xcite",
