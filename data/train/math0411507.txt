    "the structure of a modular tensor category appears in a variety of representation theoretic problems in mathematical physics . for the purposes of this contribution , by a modular tensor category we understand",
    "an abelian , semi - simple @xmath2-linear tensor category @xmath1 that comes with a braiding , i.e.  a collection of functorial isomorphisms @xmath3 for any pair @xmath4 of objects of @xmath1 , and a twist , i.e.  a collection of functorial isomorphisms @xmath5 for any object @xmath6 of @xmath1 , such that the following axioms hold : first , @xmath7 second , there is a compatible duality ; third , there are only finitely many isomorphism classes of simple objects  a set of representatives of which we denote by @xmath8  and the tensor unit @xmath9 is simple . finally , the braiding is maximally non - degenerate in the sense that the matrix @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) is invertible .",
    "modular tensor categories arise in various contexts .",
    "for example , the representation categories of the following algebraic structures can be modular tensor categories : weak quantum groups , conformal nets of von neumann algebras on the real line , and vertex algebras . in view of the role of the two latter structures in two - dimensional conformal quantum field theory ( cft ) ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , it follows in particular that modular tensor categories constitute the axiomatization of the chiral data  in essence , the monodromy of the conformal blocks  of rational cfts .",
    "recently , quite a few results have been obtained that characterize cases when representation categories are modular :    * if @xmath12 is a connected @xmath13 weak hopf algebra , then the category of unitary representations of its double is a unitary modular tensor category @xcite .",
    "* similarly , the representation category of a connected ribbon factorizable weak hopf algebra over @xmath2 ( or , more generally , over any algebraically closed field @xmath14 ) with a haar integral is modular @xcite . *",
    "if a finite - index net of von neumann algebras on the real line is strongly additive ( which for conformal nets is equivalent to haag duality ) and has the split property , its category of local sectors is a modular tensor category @xcite .",
    "* finally , according to the results of @xcite , if a self - dual vertex algebra that obeys zhu s @xmath15 cofiniteness condition and certain conditions on its homogeneous subspaces has a semi - simple representation category , then this category is actually a modular tensor category .",
    "the definition of a modular tensor category was motivated @xcite by the fact that it allows for the construction of a three - dimensional topological field theory ( tft ) .",
    "such a tft furnishes a modular functor , i.e.  it assigns finite - dimensional vector spaces to two - manifolds  more precisely , to extended surfaces  and linear maps to cobordisms .",
    "an extended surface ( for a given tensor category @xmath1 ) is a closed oriented two - dimensional manifold @xmath16 with finitely many embedded ( germs of ) arcs labelled by objects of @xmath1 , together with the choice of a lagrangian subspace in @xmath17 .",
    "there is a natural notion of morphisms of extended surfaces . given two extended surfaces @xmath16 and @xmath18 , a cobordism @xmath19 from @xmath16 to @xmath18 is an oriented three - manifold with an embedded ribbon graph such that @xmath20 .    the complex vector spaces @xmath21  called the state spaces of the tft , or the spaces of conformal blocks  assigned to extended surfaces @xmath16 obey @xmath22 and the multiplicativity property @xmath23 .",
    "a modular functor associates to each morphism @xmath24 of extended surfaces a linear map @xmath25 , while to a cobordism @xmath26 it assigns a linear map @xmath27 in particular , a cobordism of the form @xmath28 gives rise to map @xmath29 . put differently , a ribbon graph in a three - manifold @xmath19 allows one to specify a vector in the space of conformal blocks on the boundary @xmath30 .",
    "the axioms for the linear maps @xmath31  naturality , multiplicativity , normalization of the cylinder , and functoriality  have two important consequences :    * each space @xmath21 of conformal blocks carries a projective representation of the mapping class group @xmath32 .",
    "* by gluing two arcs which are labelled by simple objects @xmath33 and @xmath34 via a tube with embedded @xmath33-ribbon , one obtains isomorphisms @xmath35 , called _ factorization rules_.    to formulate a tft one employs a cobordism category of topological manifolds .",
    "the use of the term _ conformal _ block therefore needs to be justified .",
    "given a conformal vertex algebra @xmath36 and an @xmath37-tuple @xmath38 of @xmath36-modules , conformal blocks are constructed @xcite as vector bundles @xmath39 with a projectively flat connection over the moduli space @xmath40 of complex curves of genus @xmath41 with @xmath37 marked points .",
    "the monodromy data of conformal blocks on @xmath42 can then be used to equip the representation category @xmath43 with additional structure like a tensor product ( fusion ) and a braiding . in certain cases ,",
    "e.g.  the ones described in @xcite , this endows @xmath43 with the structure of a modular tensor category . from this modular tensor category , one obtains representations of the mapping class groups .",
    "it is an important open conjecture that these representations are isomorphic to the ones provided by the monodromies of the vector bundles @xmath44 .",
    "we will assume that this conjecture holds true ; this allows us to pass tacitly between topological categories of topological two - manifolds and categories of conformal or complex manifolds .",
    "the vector bundles of conformal blocks are  up to the choice of local coordinates , a subtlety we ignore for the purposes of this contribution  constructed as subbundles of the trivial bundle @xmath45 applying a flat section of the subbundle to an @xmath37-tuple of vectors @xmath46 therefore yields a multivalued function on @xmath40 .",
    "a central question , to be addressed in the next section , is how these multivalued functions are related to physical correlation functions of the conformal field theory .",
    "to describe the correlators of a local conformal field theory on a surface @xmath16  which may have a non - empty boundary and , for the moment , is supposed to be oriented  we associate to @xmath16 its ( oriented ) double @xmath47 .",
    "the double @xmath48 comes with an orientation reversing involution @xmath49 such that @xmath50 .",
    "if we work in a geometric category , i.e.  if @xmath16 is supposed to be a conformal manifold , then the double has a complex structure and @xmath49 is anti - conformal .",
    "correlators on @xmath16 are specific vectors @xmath51 in the spaces @xmath52 ( this is known as the ` principle of holomorphic factorization ' ; it has been derived @xcite for important classes of rational cfts like ( gauged ) wzw models by introducing a background gauge field on the world sheet ) .",
    "these particular elements of @xmath52 satify two types of conditions :    * the vector @xmath53 is required to be invariant under the mapping class group @xmath32 , which can be identified with the subgroup of @xmath54 that commutes with @xmath49 .",
    "( recall that @xmath55 acts projectively on @xmath56 . )",
    "* the correlators must obey factorization constraints .",
    "we do not write down these explicitly here ; in short , the image of a correlator under an isomorphism that is given by the factorization rules for the conformal blocks on the double is again a correlator .",
    "( see @xcite for precise statements and proofs . )    in view of the properties of tft discussed above , it is natural to look for an oriented three - manifold @xmath57 with boundary @xmath58 such that @xmath59 is the correlator .",
    "the following ansatz turns out to be successful : take the product of the double @xmath48 with the interval @xmath60 $ ] and mod out by the orientation preserving @xmath61 action for which the non - trivial element acts like @xmath49 on @xmath48 and like @xmath62 on the interval : @xmath63 \\right )    / \\,(\\sigma , t\\,{\\mapsto}\\ , { -}t ) \\ , .\\ ] ] this so - called connecting manifold @xcite has boundary @xmath64 ; there is a natural embedding @xmath65 acting as @xmath66 $ ] , which shows that @xmath16 is a retract of @xmath57 .",
    "for example , when @xmath16 is a disk , @xmath57 is a full ball .    to specify a correlator @xmath67 ,",
    "the three - manifold @xmath57 must be endowed with a ribbon graph .",
    "points in the interior of @xmath16 have two pre - images in @xmath48 , points on @xmath68 only one . for each field insertion point",
    "@xmath69 we place a ribbon along the distinguished interval in @xmath57 that joins @xmath70 to the pre - image(s ) of @xmath69 ; we also put ribbons along the boundary of @xmath71 .",
    "all ribbons are labelled by objects of @xmath1 , in a manner to be described in the next section . finally , we triangulate @xmath71 , in such a manner that only trivalent vertices occur .",
    "( faces can have an arbitrary number of edges ; thus , properly speaking , we are dealing with the dual of a triangulation . )",
    "each marked point @xmath70 for @xmath69 in the interior of @xmath16 must lie on an edge of the triangulation @xmath72 .",
    "we place ribbons along the edges of @xmath72 .",
    "this gives in particular rise to trivalent and quadrivalent intersections , at which we put coupons on which the ribbons end ",
    "trivalent for vertices of the triangulation and for the points @xmath70 with @xmath73 , and quadrivalent for the points @xmath70 with @xmath69 in the interior of @xmath16 .    for each of the coupons an element in the appropriate morphism space must be chosen .",
    "for the part of the triangulation that lies in the interior of @xmath71 this is done as follows .",
    "choose an object @xmath0 of @xmath1 .",
    "on each edge we place two ribbons labeled by @xmath0 which start at one of the vertices and have orientation pointing away from that vertex , and join them with a suitable morphism @xmath74 in @xmath75 , to be specified below . at each vertex",
    "we need an element in @xmath76 . a comparison of this situation with the analysis of so - called lattice tfts @xcite , where @xmath1 is the category of finite - dimensional @xmath2-vector spaces , leads us to expect that @xmath0 is a generalization of a frobenius algebra to more general tensor categories @xmath1 .",
    "as we will see , this allows us to give a model - independent approach to correlators of rational cfts that is based on a combination of tft in three dimensions and of non - commutative algebra in tensor categories .",
    "it is in fact not hard to generalize many notions of algebra and representation theory from vector spaces ( or modules over commutative rings ) to more general tensor categories .",
    "a ( unital , associative ) algebra @xmath77 in a tensor category @xmath1 , for example , is an object @xmath0 of @xmath1 together with a multiplication morphism @xmath78 that obeys @xmath79 and together with a unit morphism @xmath80 such that @xmath81 a ( coassociative , counital ) coalgebra @xmath82 is defined analogously .",
    "frobenius algebra _ in @xmath1 is an algebra that is also a coalgebra , with the additional property that the coproduct @xmath83 is a morphism of @xmath0-bimodules .",
    "the frobenius algebras of interest to us possess two more properties .",
    "first , as in most applications in representation theory , they are _ symmetric _ : denote by @xmath84 and @xmath85 the two coevaluations of the category @xmath1 ( which we assume to be sovereign ) .",
    "there are two natural isomorphisms  in fact isomorphisms of @xmath0-bimodules  @xmath86 in @xmath75 ; in a symmetric frobenius algebra , these two isomorphisms coincide .",
    "it is the morphism @xmath87 that we use along the edges of the triangulation of @xmath71 .",
    "second , our frobenius algebras are _ special _ , which means that @xmath88 is a right - inverse of the multiplication  this generalizes the notion of a separable algebra over a field  and that @xmath89 .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that in a rational cft the operator product ( ope ) for boundary fields that preserve a given boundary condition leads to a symmetric special frobenius algebra in the modular tensor category @xmath1 that describes the chiral data of the cft .",
    "the main ingredients are the associativity of the ope and the non - degeneracy of the two - point correlation function of two boundary fields on a disk , which furnishes the non - degenerate invariant bilinear form .",
    "it should also be appreciated that a frobenius algebra obtained this way from boundary fields in cft is not necessarily ( braided-)commutative , and that the underlying boundary condition is not required to be ` elementary ' .    with this in mind , the main insight of our construction can be summarized as follows @xcite . for given chiral data @xmath1 , a full local cft  which we denote as cft(@xmath0 )  can be constructed from a symmetric special frobenius algebra @xmath0 in @xmath1 .",
    "this frobenius algebra is the algebra of boundary fields ( or , in string theory terminology , of open string states ) for a single boundary condition .    as for other boundary conditions",
    "than the one used to define @xmath0 , the analysis of boundary opes involving also boundary condition changing operators shows @xcite that they correspond to modules over the frobenius algebra @xmath0 . here",
    "modules are defined in the obvious way : a ( left ) @xmath0-module is a pair @xmath90 consisting of an object @xmath91 of @xmath1 and a morphism @xmath92 such that @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "many aspects of representation theory can be generalized , see e.g.  @xcite ( in fact , some peculiar aspects can only be seen in a braided setting , compare @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , there is a notion of induced module , reciprocity theorems hold , every simple module appears in the decomposition of an induced module , and one can show that the module category of a special frobenius algebra in a semi - simple tensor category is again semi - simple .",
    "these observations supply us with the first few entries in a dictionary relating physical concepts to algebraic notions : boundary conditions are @xmath0-modules , ` elementary ' boundary conditions are simple @xmath0-modules ; a direct sum of simple @xmath0-modules amounts to introducing boundary conditions with chan - paton multiplicities . for our construction of a ribbon graph in the connecting manifold @xmath57",
    ", we conclude that ribbons labelled with the object underlying a boundary condition are to be placed along the boundary segments of @xmath71",
    ".    this dictionary can be extended , and this extension at the same time completes our labeling of the ribbons in the connecting manifold @xmath57 . a boundary field",
    "@xmath95 that changes the boundary condition from @xmath96 to @xmath97 has a single chiral insertion @xmath98 and a trivalent vertex at the boundary of @xmath71 that must be labeled by an element of @xmath99 , where @xmath100 carries the obvious structure of a left @xmath0-module and @xmath101 denotes morphisms of left @xmath0-modules .",
    "field insertions @xmath69 in the interior of @xmath16 have two pre - images .",
    "bulk fields are thus labeled @xmath102 : the two ribbons in @xmath57 that originate from the pre - images of @xmath69 are inward - pointing and are labeled by @xmath98 and @xmath103 , respectively .",
    "further , these ribbons hit the @xmath0-ribbon that is placed on the edge of the triangulation @xmath72 passing through @xmath70 , and the corresponding quadri - valent vertex is labeled by an element of @xmath104 , a morphism of @xmath0-bimodules . here",
    "the superscripts @xmath105 indicate that the object @xmath106 is given the following structure of an @xmath0-bimodule : the left action is @xmath107 , while the right @xmath0-action is @xmath108 .",
    "it is natural to not only consider the special @xmath0-bimodule @xmath0 itself , but allow for arbitrary @xmath0-bimodules @xmath109 as well .",
    "they correspond to ( tensionless ) conformal defect lines which can be added to the triangulation .",
    "defect fields can change such defects ; the corresponding quadri - valent vertices for a change of defect from @xmath110 to @xmath111 are labeled by @xmath0-bimodule morphisms in @xmath112 .    using the ansatz for obtaining the correlators in terms of three - manifolds with embedded ribbon graphs described above , factorization and invariance under the action of the mapping class group @xmath32",
    "can be proven @xcite .",
    "also , other mathematical objects defined previously in the discussion of rational conformal field theory , like the so - called classifying algebra or nimreps , are recovered naturally and their properties can be established rigorously @xcite .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that our formalism provides a unified treatment of all modular invariant torus partition functions  both those of simple current type and exceptional modular invariants .",
    "note that we have started from a single arbitrary boundary condition to construct the ( symmetric special ) frobenius algebra @xmath0 .",
    "a different boundary condition will , in general , give us a different frobenius algebra @xmath113 .",
    "but as it turns out , for a given cft any two such frobenius algebras are morita equivalent and , moreover , morita equivalent frobenius algebras give equivalent correlators ; we express this as cft(@xmath113)@xmath114cft(@xmath0 ) .",
    "finally , we mention that our construction can be extended @xcite to the situation that @xmath16 is not oriented , and possibly not even orientable . in that case , the frobenius algebra @xmath0 must be equipped with the additional structure of a _",
    "jandl algebra_. for a jandl algebra @xmath0 there is an isomorphism of algebras @xmath115 which squares to the twist , @xmath116 . in the special case that @xmath1 is the category of vector spaces , the structure of a jandl algebra reduces to a ( symmetric special frobenius ) algebra with an involution .",
    "next we wish to describe the relation of the approach to rational cft based on symmetric special frobenius algebras to other algebraic structures whose relevance to the problem has been suggested .    as a first step",
    ", we notice that the category  of left modules over an algebra @xmath0 in a tensor category @xmath1 carries the structure of a so - called module category @xcite over @xmath1 : there is a `` mixed '' tensor functor @xmath117 with an associativity constraint that satisfies generalized triangle and pentagon axioms .",
    "morita equivalent algebras can be characterized @xcite by the fact that they yield equivalent module categories .    for a symmetric special frobenius algebra in an abelian semi - simple tensor category ,",
    "the module category @xmath118 is abelian and semi - simple .",
    "we can therefore find a complex semi - simple algebra @xmath119 whose representation category @xmath120 is equivalent , as an abelian category , to @xmath121 .",
    "obviously , @xmath119 is a direct sum of full matrix algebras whose number of minimal ideals equals the number of simple objects in @xmath121 . since only the number of minimal ideals , but not their dimension , matters , @xmath119 is a non - canonical object . in any case",
    ", this equivalence endows @xmath120 with the structure of a module category over @xmath1 .",
    "next , recall the elementary fact that an abelian group @xmath96 is a module over a ring @xmath122 iff there is a morphism of rings from @xmath122 into @xmath123 .",
    "an analogous theorem is valid for categories @xcite ; the ring @xmath122 is replaced by the tensor category @xmath1 , the module @xmath96 by the module category @xmath121 , and morphisms of rings by fiber functors , i.e. , in the setting we are interested in , by monoidal functors . if @xmath124 as an abelian category , then the bimodules @xmath125 play the role of @xmath123 , and we have a natural bijection between fiber functors from @xmath1 into @xmath125 and structures of a module category over @xmath1 on @xmath120 .    thus in the situation of interest to us we obtain a bimodule - valued fiber functor @xmath126 one would now like to apply familiar arguments from tannaka theory to the algebra @xmath127 of endomorphisms of the fiber functor to endow it with some structure that generalizes hopf algebras .",
    "this can indeed be done @xcite , provided that separability data for @xmath119 are chosen , i.e.  a right - inverse of the multiplication and a left - inverse of the unit .",
    "( except for the case that all minimal ideals of @xmath119 are one - dimensional , there is no canonical separability structure . )",
    "it turns out that @xmath128 can then be endowed with the structure of a weak hopf algebra and that @xmath129 is equivalent , as a tensor category , to @xmath1 .",
    "this construction has a converse : any weak hopf algebra @xmath12 gives rise to the tensor category @xmath130 of left @xmath12-modules and a module category @xmath121 over @xmath1 : a weak hopf algebra contains two commuting associative unital subalgebras @xmath131 and @xmath132 which are related by the antipode . since the antipode is an anti - morphism of algebras , @xmath132 can be identified with the opposite algebra of @xmath131 . by restriction to @xmath131 and @xmath132 ,",
    "any left @xmath12-module can be seen to be an @xmath132-bimodule , and hence we have found a tensor functor from @xmath1 to @xmath133 .",
    "the general result mentioned above now implies that the category @xmath134 is a module category over @xmath1 .",
    "now indeed , as has been argued in @xcite , the structure of a weak hopf algebra ( called ocneanu double triangle algebra ) can be abstracted from a rational cft and its boundary conditions .",
    "the discussion above shows that this algebra is not canonical ; there are infinitely many non - isomorphic weak hopf algebras which lead to equivalent module categories and hence to one and the same cft .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that in this description the braiding on @xmath1 must be expressed in terms of an @xmath119-matrix for the weak hopf algebra , a structure that is not as well amenable to explicit computations as our pictorial calculus using ribbon graphs .",
    "still , this approach can provide non - trivial insight ; for instance , using the fact that davydov ",
    "yetter cohomology of the pair @xmath135 can be expressed in terms of hochschild cohomology of any of the hopf algebras @xmath128 , it was shown in @xcite that rational conformal field theories can not be deformed within the class of rational conformal field theories .",
    "given a module category @xmath136 over a tensor category @xmath1 , immediately a third category enters the game the tensor category @xmath137 of @xmath0-bimodules .",
    "in our situation the latter category is actually equivalent to the category of module functors @xmath138 and thus does not depend on the choice of @xmath0 in a morita class .",
    "in contrast to @xmath121 the category @xmath139 is a tensor category , with tensor unit @xmath0 . while in our case @xmath1 is braided , @xmath139 is not braided , in general .",
    "indeed , the objects of @xmath139 have the physical interpretation of tensionless defect lines whose fusion @xcite is described by the tensor product on @xmath139 , and there is no reason for the fusion of defects to be commutative .    in the present situation",
    "we then deal with four bifunctors @xcite : the tensor products of @xmath1 and @xmath139 , the defining operation @xmath140 of the module category @xmath121 , and a functor @xmath141 acting on objects as @xmath142 .",
    "there are five associativity constraints : one for each of the tensor categories @xmath1 and @xmath139 , and three mixed constraints for the threefold products @xmath143 , @xmath144 ( stating that @xmath121 is a module category over both @xmath1 and @xmath139 ) and @xmath145 .",
    "associativity of higher products is ensured by six axioms of pentagon type ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.3 ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that the braiding on @xmath1  which is a crucial structure in the application to cft  is not accounted for in this setup .",
    "other notions that have been discussed in this context are graphs and cells @xcite .",
    "the term ` cell ' is motivated by the following visualization of the structure described above in terms of oriented simplices in three dimensions .",
    "vertices can be coloured `` black '' or `` white '' .",
    "this gives three types of edges : those joining two black vertices are to be labelled by simple objects of @xmath1 , those joining two white vertices by simple objects of @xmath139 .",
    "an edge joining a white vertex to a black one is labelled by a simple object of @xmath121 .",
    "( in principle , one can also admit edges joining a black vertex to a white vertex .",
    "if the module category @xmath121 is realized as a category of left @xmath0-modules , then one should label these edges by right @xmath0-modules . )",
    "these edges can form triangles ; one only needs to consider triangles for which the edges are oriented in such a way that the boundary does not form a closed oriented path .",
    "the corresponding composition of two objects to a third object is naturally interpreted as a ( possibly mixed ) tensor product .",

    "<S> algebra and representation theory in modular tensor categories can be combined with tools from topological field theory to obtain a deeper understanding of rational conformal field theories in two dimensions : it allows us to establish the existence of sets of consistent correlation functions , to demonstrate some of their properties in a model - independent manner , and to derive explicit expressions for ope coefficients and coefficients of partition functions in terms of invariants of links in three - manifolds . </S>",
    "<S> + we show that a morita class of ( symmetric special ) frobenius algebras @xmath0 in a modular tensor category @xmath1 encodes all data needed to describe the correlators . </S>",
