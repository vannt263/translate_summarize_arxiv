    "the _ chandra _ spectra of ngc 4151 @xcite and mrk 3 @xcite , sources in which our direct line of sight to the nucleus is subject to heavy absorption , are characterized by strong emission lines from hot photoionized plasmas located in the extended narrow - line regions of these galaxies . for an overview of the _ chandra _",

    "narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) differ from these bls1s in that they have narrower optical emission lines and steeper soft x - ray continua , which are usually highly variable .",
    "see @xcite for observational criteria that define nls1s .",
    "@xcite and others have suggested that the the accretion rates in nls1s are closer to the eddington limit than in bls1s of the same luminosities .",
    "the high resolution _",
    "_ grating spectra of the nls1 galaxies , ton s 180 @xcite and ngc 4051 @xcite , do not yet provide a consistent picture of nls1s .",
    "ngc 4051 has a few emission and absorption lines on a complex continuum , while the x - ray spectrum of ton s 180 is relatively featureless .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ reflection grating spectrometer ( * ? ? ?",
    "* rgs ) observations of nls1s have shown broad absorption troughs attributed to l shell transitions of weakly ionized fe in two cases : iras 13349 + 2438 @xcite and mrk 359 @xcite .",
    "further high resolution spectra of nls1s are needed to clarify the relation between this class of source and their broad - line counterparts .",
    "mrk 478 is a classic example of the nls1 class with a strong steep x - ray spectrum @xcite and low interstellar column density ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "these attributes combine to make it one of the brightest nls1s in the extreme ultraviolet ( euv , @xmath5 kev ) @xcite .",
    "the spectrum measured by _ euve _ remains somewhat controversial : @xcite modelled it with a steep power law spectrum with @xmath6 @xmath7 but @xcite later claimed that it showed strong emission lines at 79 and 83  in the rest frame .",
    "these differences may have resulted from the poor statistical significance of the spectral data .",
    "@xcite argued that the rapid , high amplitude euv variability of mrk 478 , coupled with weak uv variability indicated that the euv to soft x - ray portion of the spectrum was the result of comptonized thermal emission near the inner edge of an accretion disk .",
    "the _ euve _",
    "data , however , were insufficient to test for spectral variability or to search for features in the variability spectrum on time scales of less than a few hours .",
    "mrk 478 was observed with the chandra low energy grating spectrometer ( letgs ) using the high resolution camera on 8 - 9 august 2000 ( tjd = jd - 2451000 .",
    "= 765.31 - 766.27 ) .",
    "the exposure time was 80857 s. nearly simultaneous observations were obtained with bepposax medium energy concentrator spectrometer ( mecs ) @xcite from tjd 766.07 through 767.59 .      the average , background - subtracted count rate in zeroth order was 0.409 @xmath3 0.002 count s@xmath8 in a 11  radius aperture which contains @xmath9 99% of the power . background was determined from a similarly sized region 26  away from zeroth order in a direction avoiding the dispersed spectra and the diffraction spikes caused by the letg coarse and fine support structure .",
    "the count rate in 300 s bins varied by 30 - 40% over the observation ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lc ] ) .",
    "the dispersed events were binned in 4000 s intervals in order to determine a softness ratio , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the counts in hard ( 5 - 25  , or about 0.5 - 2.5 kev ) and soft ( 25 - 60  , 0.2 - 0.5 kev ) bands .",
    "the uncertainties were determined from counting statistics only .",
    "the total count rate light curve showed variability on short time scales . assuming that the variations follow a gaussian distribution with standard deviation @xmath13 about the mean count rate @xmath14 ,",
    "then the fractional variability amplitude is @xmath15 0.008 after accounting for poisson fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the strongest event was an increase of almost a factor of 2 in just 20 ksec .",
    "the softness ratio also showed a clear trend , decreasing by about 25% throughout the observation .",
    "however , this slow trend is not obviously correlated with any of the rapid variations in the total count rate .",
    "fitting spectra to the first and last 10000 s of the observation gives photon indices that changed from 3.02 @xmath3 0.05 to 2.82 @xmath3 0.05 over the course of the observation ( fixing the column density to the best - fit value ) .",
    "the letgs spectral data were reduced from standard l1 event lists using idl and custom processing scripts .",
    "the procedure is quite similar to standard processing using ciao and is described in more detail by @xcite .",
    "the position of zeroth order was used to locate the standard `` bow - tie '' extraction region .",
    "the effective area ( ea ) of the letgs has undergone a few revisions since launch both due to a recalculation of the letg efficiencies and due to a series of in - flight calibration observations designed to probe the hrc - s quantum efficiency .",
    "we adjusted the ea as described in the appendix , which provides a good fit to the spectrum of pks 2155 - 304 to a power law model .",
    "based on a simple model of the spectrum ( see the next section ) , high order fluxes are negligible for @xmath16 0.15 kev . in the 0.10 - 0.15 kev range where high orders are important , the high order spectra are generally smooth so that it is still possible to detect emission or absorption lines .",
    "based on the analysis in the appendix , the systematic uncertainties in the high order contributions are estimated to be @xmath17 10% for @xmath18 kev , where high orders contribute less than half of the observed flux .",
    "the letgs data were rebinned adaptively to provide a signal / noise ratio of 5 in each bin over the 0.15 to 10.0 kev range ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : spectrum ] ) . using the adjusted ea model , the spectrum",
    "was well fitted by a simple power law with a photon index of 2.91 @xmath3 0.03 .",
    "fit parameters are summarized in table  [ tab - spectra ] .",
    "the reduced @xmath19 was 1.022 for 891 degrees of freedom , which is an acceptable fit even without adding possible systematic errors .",
    "the quoted uncertainties are 90% for one interesting parameter ; the uncertainties in @xmath4 and @xmath20 were highly correlated so the joint uncertainties are somewhat larger .",
    "this model was used as the basis for line searches in the letgs data .",
    "a single power law model was a bad fit to the letgs and mecs data jointly . combining a more coarsely binned letgs spectrum ( to a signal / noise ratio of 20 ) with the mecs data ,",
    "the minimum @xmath19 was 439 for 152 degrees of freedom for model consisting of a single power law ( see table  [ tab - spectra ] ) .",
    "the main deviations are found at high energies as the spectrum flattens in the 2 - 10 kev band ; @xmath21 0.03 was determined from _ asca _ observations @xcite . for the mecs data alone , we obtain @xmath22 0.2 , comparable to the _ asca _ results and significantly flatter than the slope obtained from the letgs data alone . the x - ray spectrum from 0.15 - 10.0",
    "kev is best fit by the sum of two power laws with photon indices of 3.03 @xmath3 0.04 and 1.4 @xmath3 0.2 ( see fig .  [",

    "the joint confidence region for the two power law indices is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : confregion ] .",
    "the steep spectral slope of the soft band is comparable to previous results . using _ euve _",
    "data in the wavelength range 65 - 120  ( about 0.1 - 0.2 kev ) , @xcite obtained a slope of 4.2 @xmath3 0.7 .",
    "@xcite also found a steep photon index ( 3.32@xmath23 ) using rosat pspc data from the 0.11 - 1.9 kev band .",
    "the galactic @xmath4 measured by 21 cm absorption @xcite is @xmath24 , which is consistent with the fit results .",
    "the letgs spectrum was binned at 0.025  , which is half of the instrument resolution .",
    "no significant features were found that were consistent with the instrument line response .",
    "the data were rebinned at 0.125  to create a count spectrum at slightly coarser resolution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : countspec ] ) with sufficient counts per bin to search for narrow spectral features against the continuum model .",
    "in order to allow @xmath25% chance of a random line detection , features must be more significant than @xmath26 , given that about 790 bins are examined ( in the 1 - 100   band shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : countspec ] . the one bin exceeding this threshold is in the c - k edge where the ea has a systematic error .",
    "we conclude that there are no significant , narrow absorption or emission features in the spectrum . at specific wavelengths",
    ", we can reduce the significance level threshold because there are nt as many bins tested .",
    "we derived 3@xmath27 limits to the equivalent widths of unresolved lines ( fwhm @xmath28 0.05  ) : 0.20   ( 800 ev ) at fe - k@xmath29 , 0.10   for the 4 - 90   range and 0.035   in the 6 - 35   range .    finally , we searched for broader lines , particularly in the euv region where @xcite reported 1 - 2  wide lines at 79 and 83   in the rest frame with fluxes of 4.8 and 2.5 @xmath30 ph @xmath7 s@xmath8 .",
    "the line detections were claimed to be significant at the 2.8 and 3.6 @xmath27 level , respectively . in order to search for these features in the chandra spectrum ,",
    "the putative lines were modeled as gaussians with @xmath31  . using the best fit power law model and the high order efficiencies",
    ", we computed the high order contributions and subtracted them to produce a spectrum representative of first order only .",
    "this spectrum was binned to 0.5   resolution in order to search for lines that might be @xmath17 1   wide .",
    "[ fig : euvspec ] shows that any lines with @xmath32  must be rather weak .",
    "we can place conservative @xmath33 upper limits to lines 1   wide at @xmath34 ph @xmath7 s@xmath8 in the 60 - 100   range .",
    "the letgs data can give confidence to an extrapolation from the euv into the x - ray band , as indicated from simultaneous observations with iue , euve , and asca @xcite .",
    "it seems rather clear now that the peak of the spectral energy distribution is in the euv band , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the thermal peak of disk emission is limited to less than 0.1 kev in order that there be no significant spectral curvature in the letgs spectrum above 0.2 kev .",
    "thus , we may place a limit on the blackbody temperature of @xmath35 kev .    the power law shape in the .15 - 10 kev band can be obtained by comptonizing the disk thermal emission as suggested by @xcite in a disk corona .",
    "we modelled the disk spectrum as a blackbody at @xmath3620 ev and set the coronal electron temperature to @xmath37 kev . using the comptt model @xcite in _ xspec _ , we estimate that the optical depth can be of @xmath38 in order to obtain the rather steep spectral slope below 1 kev . above 1 kev",
    ", the flatter spectrum can be reproduced with the same input spectrum and comptonizing region but with a somewhat larger optical depth , @xmath39 . in reality , there would likely be a wide range of optical depths .",
    "the relative strengths of the two components would depend entirely on the relative covering fractions ; in this case , the higher optical depth region should be @xmath171% of the covering fraction in at lower optical depth .",
    "alternatively , @xcite found that self - comptonized disk atmospheres consisting of h and he can have steep soft spectra for black hole masses @xmath40 m@xmath41 . disk atmospheres with significant metal content would be expected to show absorption edges that are not observed and have somewhat flatter spectra @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of a comptonized disk should drop exponentially near 1 kev ( hubeny et al . ) but this is where a hard power law component begins to dominate , which would result from comptonization of the disk emission by a very hot corona .",
    "it is interesting that the softness ratios vary on relatively long time scales for both nls1s and bls1s . in bls1s ,",
    "the spectra tend to soften as they brighten .",
    "this has been taken to indicate that a relatively slowly varying soft component , possibly direct emission from an accretion disk , contributes to the soft x - ray spectra of bls1s . in mrk 478 and in the nls1s akn  564 and ton  s180 @xcite , however , the total count rate is rapidly variable and appears to be uncorrelated with the softness ratio .",
    "the spectral modelling suggests that the entire x - ray spectrum is governed by compton scattering of thermal emission from the accretion disk . in the covering fraction model ,",
    "the spectral shapes are dependent primarily on the structure of the corona , which is substantially larger than the hottest regions of the accretion disk , so the spectral shape can vary slowly as the seed photon rate varies . in the disk self - comptonization model , however , the comptonizing region is intimately linked to the photon source via the vertical structure of the disk .",
    "it would seem unlikely that this vertical structure would vary slowly as the accretion rate through the disk changes rapidly .",
    "we find no narrow emission or absorption features .",
    "in particular , we do not detect emission lines at 79 and 83  that were reported by @xcite using the same _ euve _ data used by @xcite to fit a simple continuum model .",
    "similarly , none of the forbidden lines found in the ngc 4051 spectrum are detected in our spectrum ; the limit on the si xiii line at 6.741   is consistent with the equivalent width of this line in ngc 4051 but the ne ix line is at least 50% weaker ( with a limit of 0.025  ) and the o vii 22.102   line is @xmath426 weaker than their counterparts in ngc 4051 .",
    "@xcite show that the lines observed in the ngc 4051 x - ray spectrum could result from a warm absorption system as found in many broad line sy 1 galaxies @xcite .",
    "the nls1 akn 564 also shows signs of a warm absorber @xcite . for mrk 478 , however , we find no evidence of warm absorption that would link this source to other nls1s , so warm absorption is not a characteristic that can be used to distinguish broad and narrow line sy 1 galaxies .",
    "one nls1 which has a spectrum similar to that of mrk 478 is pks 0558 - 504 .",
    "the rgs spectrum @xcite shows no significant absorption or emission line features in the 0.3 - 2 kev band . instead of fitting the soft spectrum to a power law shape , they used a combination of several blackbody spectra .",
    "support for this work was provided by the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) through chandra award number nag 5 - 10032 issued by the chandra x - ray center ( cxc ) , which is operated by the smithsonian astrophysical observatory for and on behalf of nasa under contract nas 8 - 39073 .",
    "hlm was supported under nasa contract sao sv1 - 61010 for the cxc .",
    "we started with the letgs effective area ( ea ) that was released by the chandra x - ray center on 9 mar 2000 and updated 31 oct 2000 .",
    "the letg efficiencies were used , along with the transmission models of the uv ion shield , to determine the eas for orders 2 - 5 .",
    "the eas were adjusted based on an analysis of the letgs spectrum of pks  2155 - 304 , observation i d 331 .",
    "the spectrum of pks  2155 - 304 was well fitted by a power law with a photon index of 2.45 for energies in the 0.5 to 3 kev range , so the model was extrapolated below 0.5 kev to examine the accuracy of calibration near and below the c - k edge .",
    "a very good fit with systematic errors of less than 10% could be obtained with slight adjustments to the 1st order ea model ; decreasing the optical depth at c - k ( 0.285 kev ) by 0.13 and adding an edge at 75   ( 0.162 kev ) with an optical depth of 0.4 .",
    "the 75   edge is an approximate description for an ea adjustment that has now been added to the letgs ea model but it is not a physical one .",
    "this wavelength merely corresponds to a point where the low energy calibration based on hz 43 was joined to a high energy calibration based on pks  2155 - 304 @xcite .",
    "higher order efficiencies in 2nd , 3rd , and 4th orders were adjusted by factors of 0.5 , 0.8 , and 1.8 , respectively , in order to match the c - k edge features of 2nd and 3rd orders ( at about 87   and 130  , respectively ) and to match the overall count spectrum in the 0.1 - 0.15 kev band ( where these orders dominate ) .",
    "we included 5th order , which was always less than 10% of the observed counts for @xmath43 kev and ignored all higher orders .",
    "there were significant residuals in the letgs spectra of both pks 2155 - 304 and mrk 421 ( observation i d 1715 ) at the c - k edge in first order , however , due to a 0.5 ev error in the energies of the resonance features ( resulting from a flight filter wavelength calibration inaccuracy ) as described by @xcite .        where @xmath49 is the wavelength in order @xmath50 that disperses to the same physical location as @xmath47 in first order",
    ", @xmath51 is the photon flux at @xmath47 , and @xmath52 is the ea in order @xmath50 at @xmath47 . the spectrum shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : pksspec ] was computed using      where @xmath54 , so @xmath55 is actually an estimate of @xmath51 , differing only in the inclusion of higher orders .",
    "the contributions to the observed flux densities calculated using eq .  [ eq : allorder ] due to order @xmath50 at first order wavelength @xmath47 are          in spectral fitting , eq .  [ eq : sumorder ] is solved iteratively for @xmath51 or the parameters of a model giving @xmath51 .",
