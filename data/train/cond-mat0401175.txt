    "there is a long standing debate in the field of colloidal science concerning a possibility of phase separation in aqueous colloidal suspensions containing monovalent counterions .",
    "charged colloids provide a particular challenge to the theorists . the long ranged coulomb interaction and",
    "the extremely large asymmetry between the polyions and the counterions makes it very difficult to apply to this system the traditional methods of the liquid state theory .",
    "in particular , such a well established tool of condensed matter theorists as integral equations is found to be useless when applied to strongly asymmetric electrolytes at large couplings ( low temperatures ) . for a wide range of parameters of physical interest",
    "the integral equations fail to even converge .",
    "the original hope of associating the lack of convergence with an underlying physical instability has proven to be unfounded@xcite .",
    "recently , a linearized density functional theory has been used to study charged colloidal suspensions @xcite .",
    "the theory predicted a thermodynamic instability which manifested itself as a fluid - fluid phase separation .",
    "however , the underlying approximation of the theory put its conclusions in doubt @xcite .",
    "specifically the linearization of the density functional lowers the statistical weight of the configurations in which the counterions are in a close vicinity of the polyions .",
    "this effect can be partially accounted for through the renormalization of the bare colloidal charge @xcite . unlike the bare charge , which can be very large , the effective ( renormalized ) charge is found to be bounded by the saturation value controlled in a given solvent by the colloidal size , temperature , and salt concentration .",
    "the renormalization of colloidal charge was argued to wash out the phase transition predicted by the linear theories @xcite .",
    "furthermore , numerical solutions of the full non - linear poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) equation inside a wigner seitz ( ws ) cell shows absence of any instability@xcite . on the other hand , linearization of the pb equation leads to a non - convex pressure , as a function of colloidal concentration , similar to the one observed in other linear theories .",
    "all these suggest that the phase instability predicted by the linear theories might be an artifact of the underlying approximations .    to further explore these interesting points ,",
    "we have investigated the thermodynamics of particles fixed at constant surface potential@xcite .",
    "relevance of the constant potential ensemble follows from the observation that unlike the bare charge , the effective charge of colloidal particles does not grow indefinitely but instead saturates .",
    "the saturation value is such that the effective electrostatic potential @xmath0 in the vicinity of colloidal surface is @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the elementary charge .",
    "thus , although the colloidal charge can be very large , the potential near the colloidal surface , i.e. within the debye length , does not increase beyond @xmath1 .",
    "this simple observation is sufficient to construct a consistent thermodynamic description of colloids with a state dependent effective charge . since the ws cell description of colloidal suspension@xcite does not lead to a fluid - fluid phase separation ( see @xcite for a general argument ) , to further understand the mechanism of the instability observed within the linearized theories , we focus on this alternative treatment .",
    "we shall first ( section [ sec : theory ] ) , study the effect of charge renormalization on the polyion - microion interaction free energy , i.e. the volume term that appears when the original mixture of colloids , coions and counterions is mapped onto an effective one component system of dressed colloids @xcite . in section [ sec : jellium ] an alternative derivation of the thermodynamic equation of state based only on the far field considerations is presented .",

    "<S> we develop a thermodynamic description of particles held at a fixed surface potential . </S>",
    "<S> this system is of particular interest in view of the continuing controversy over the possibility of a fluid - fluid phase separation in aqueous colloidal suspensions with monovalent counterions . </S>",
    "<S> the condition of fixed surface potential allows in a natural way to account for the colloidal charge renormalization . in a first approach </S>",
    "<S> , we assess the importance of the so called `` volume terms '' , and find that in the absence of salt , charge renormalization is sufficient to stabilize suspension against a fluid - fluid phase separation . </S>",
    "<S> presence of salt , on the other hand , is found to lead to an instability . a very strong dependence on the approximations used </S>",
    "<S> , however , puts the reality of this phase transition in a serious doubt . to further understand the nature of the instability we next study </S>",
    "<S> a jellium - like approximation , which does not lead to a phase separation and produces a relatively accurate analytical equation of state for a deionized suspensions of highly charged colloidal spheres . a critical analysis of various theories of strongly asymmetric electrolytes is presented to asses their reliability as compared to the monte carlo simulations . </S>"
