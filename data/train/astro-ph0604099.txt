    "rotating stars are subject to a variety of nonaxisymmetric instabilities @xcite . if a star rotates sufficiently fast  to a point where the ratio of its rotational to gravitational potential energy @xmath4  it will encounter a dynamical bar - mode instability that will result in the deformation of the star into a rapidly spinning , bar - like structure .",
    "this instability has been verified by a number of numerical hydrodynamics investigations @xcite . at a slower rotation rate ,",
    "@xmath5 , a star may also encounter a secular bar - mode instability that can promote deformation into a bar - like shape , but only if the star is subjected to a dissipative process capable of redistributing angular momentum within its structure , such as viscosity or gravitational radiation reaction ( grr ) forces @xcite . in reality ,",
    "viscosity and grr forces tend to compete with each other and can drive the secularly unstable star along a variety of different evolutionary paths .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite used numerical hydrodynamic techniques to study the nonlinear evolution of the grr - driven secular bar - mode instability in rotating , `` polytropic '' neutron stars in the absence of any competing dissipation .",
    "the above studies have shown that the critical limits of both the secular and dynamical bar - mode instabilities do not depend sensitively on the degree of compressibility of the equation of state ( eos ) or on the differential rotation law of a star .",
    "surprisingly , several recent numerical studies have found that dynamical instabilities that excite @xmath1 as well as @xmath6 azimuthal fourier modes can arise in self - gravitating structures having @xmath7 , that is , having a rotational energy below the threshold traditionally expected for dynamical nonaxisymmetirc instabilities .",
    "@xcite found an @xmath6 instability in self - gravitating rings and tori having uniform specific angular momentum and @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite found a one - armed ( @xmath1 ) spiral instability in stellar models with a polytropic index @xmath9 , strong differential rotation and @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite found an @xmath6 instability in extremely differentially rotating stellar models having @xmath11 on the order of @xmath12 !",
    "@xcite concluded that one - armed ( @xmath1 ) modes only appear in structures with a very soft equation of state ( @xmath13 ) , and that a necessary condition for this instability to arise is the presence of an off - center density maximum , that is , a toroidal - like structure .",
    "@xcite showed that a one - armed spiral instability may arise in the context of a pre - supernova core collapse .",
    "the linear analysis of @xcite has suggested that these low @xmath11 instabilities are triggered because corotation points of the unstable modes fall within the differentially rotating structure of the examined models .",
    "@xcite also have carried out a linear stability analysis that shows a connection between the one - armed , @xmath1 instability and corotation points in differentially rotating stars .    many earlier studies of disks and tori have also noted an association between the onset of dynamical instabilities and the existence of corotation points . for example , a number of groups @xcite have used both linear analyses and nonlinear simulations to study the so - called papaloizou - pringle instability , which is triggered by corotation resonances .",
    "but the existence of a corotation point within a model is not sufficient to ensure significant growth of an unstable mode .",
    "it appears as though a resonant cavity is also required to drive these modes to very large amplitude . in the case of the papaloizou - pringle instability , the inner and outer edges of the disk or torus form a resonant cavity in which waves are reflected back and forth ; the unstable mode is greatly amplified through multiple passages across the corotation radius .",
    "however , it is not obvious how such a resonant cavity can exist in stellar models that have no inner edges .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have discussed how the radial distribution of vortensity or potential vorticity , which is defined as the ratio between vorticity and surface density , is important in determining the stability of homentropic , self - gravitating rings and disks . @xcite and @xcite extended this discussion to non - homentropic disks .",
    "according to their analysis of the so - called `` rossby - wave instability '' , local minima in the radial vortensity profile of homentropic configurations tend to trap radially propagating waves and , hence , can serve as resonant cavities that will help drive corotation instabilities to large amplitude .",
    "this removes the necessity of having disk edges to serve as reflecting boundaries . in their subsequent nonlinear simulations",
    ", @xcite found that this mechanism can aid in the excitation of nonaxisymmetric instabilities ( @xmath1 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) and vortex formation in accretion disks .",
    "it is interesting to note that when the initial perturbations in these nonlinear simulations contained the pure eigenfunctions for a given azimuthal mode ( for example , @xmath3 or @xmath15 ) , the corresponding mode developed ; but , when a white noise initial perturbation was used , an @xmath1 spiral mode became dominant in the final stage .",
    "it is conceivable that a similar resonant cavity mechanism may work to amplify corotation resonances in stellar models .",
    "this would seem to be especially likely for rapidly rotating models that have toroidal - like structures because the associated off - center density maximum will inevitably result in a dip in the radial vortensity profile of the star .",
    "this profile could then act as a resonant cavity to trap radially propagating waves .",
    "alternatively , a maximum in the star s radial entropy profile can also produce such a cavity @xcite , but in keeping with most previous studies of the low @xmath11 instabilities we will confine our analysis to homentropic configurations where a dip in the vortensity profile will be required to create a resonant cavity .    in this paper ,",
    "we report the unexpected discovery of an @xmath1 spiral - mode instability in rotating stars with a relatively stiff ( @xmath0 ) polytropic eos that was designed to represent differentially rotating neutron stars .",
    "we also show evidence that this instability is directly triggered by the existence inside the star of a corotation radius for the eigenmode .",
    "this one - armed spiral instability develops on a timescale that is somewhat longer than the growth time observed in previous studies of configurations with a softer eos , but the instability appears to be dynamical nevertheless .",
    "all of our unstable models exhibit a local minimum in their radial vortensity profile and this seems likely to be the resonant cavity that traps the wave and permits it to amplify .",
    "( we have found that such a minimum can exist in configurations with centrally condensed , rather than toroidal , density structures when the degree of differential rotation is sufficiently strong . )",
    "our results suggest that it is the combination of corotation points and resonant cavities formed by vortensity minima that is responsible for the excitation of low @xmath11 instabilities found in stellar models .",
    "perhaps our most striking discovery is that , in addition to the @xmath1 mode , @xmath16=2 and 3 modes also come into play as long as their corotation points exist within the structure of the star .",
    "therefore , if the rotational profile of the star is steep enough to contain corotation points of multiple modes , these unstable modes may all arise within one single star .",
    "the entire picture of rotational instabilities that might arise in differentially rotating neutron stars becomes more complicated due to the co - existence of these corotation instabilities .",
    "the corresponding gravitational - wave signals may exhibit different characteristic frequencies at different or overlapping times , since various unstable modes may set in simultaneously .",

    "we measured the fourier amplitude of each mode with azimuthal quantum number @xmath16 in the following fashion : at any point in time during an evolution , the azimuthal density distribution in a ring of fixed @xmath33 and @xmath34 can be decomposed into a series of azimuthal fourier components via the relation , @xmath35 where the complex amplitudes @xmath36 are defined by the expression , @xmath37 in our simulations , the time - dependent behavior of the magnitude of this coefficient , @xmath38 , is then monitored to measure the growth - rate of various unstable modes . at any point in time , the ratio between the imaginary and real parts of @xmath39 gives us a spatially dependent phase angle @xmath40 from which we also are able to determine the azimuthal structure of each unstable mode @xmath16 , if it exists .",

    "this investigation began as an extension of paper i ( where uniformly rotating neutron stars were studied ) and our initial aim was to study the secular bar - mode instability in differentially rotating neutron stars . the first model we evolved was model * j250 * , which was expected to be secularly unstable but dynamically stable to the high @xmath11 bar - mode instability .",

    "this is consistent with the results reported by @xcite .",

    "the density contour plots in the bottom right - hand panel of figure [ fig : mode250 g ] suggest that the @xmath1 mode has a one - armed spiral structure similar to the one discovered by @xcite .",
    "we note that , late in the evolution , the amplitude of the @xmath6 mode increases when the @xmath1 mode reaches the nonlinear regime .",

    "figure [ fig : mode250 ] shows the time - evolution of the amplitudes of different modes for this second evolution . as expected , the @xmath6 bar - mode was not unstable in the absence of grr forces , but surprisingly the @xmath1 mode remained unstable , becoming the dominant fourier component at time @xmath57 . compared to models that had a softer eos @xcite in which the @xmath1 mode grew on a time scale of a few tens of @xmath50 , the growth time here is much longer but nevertheless still dynamical .",
    "( we note that the growth time in this pure hydrodynamical evolution is also longer than that from the previous run , in which grr was turned on .",
    "this is probably because grr tends to increase the degree of differential rotation , hence influence the growth rate of the @xmath1 mode . )",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig : drhoj250 ] shows the radial eigenfunction of the @xmath1 mode obtained by subtracting the initial axisymmetric background density ( bottom panel of figure [ fig : drhoj250 ] ) .",
    "its behavior is qualitatively similar to that derived from a linear stability analysis by @xcite ( see their figure 9 ) .",
    "the appearance of the one - armed spiral instability in our models with a stiff eos seems to suggest that its stability criterion is independent of compressibility .",
    "now the question is what mechanism is responsible for its growth ? according to @xcite , @xcite , and related studies of disks and tori @xcite , corotation points may be responsible for the amplification of some unstable modes .",
    "but this mechanism of amplification can only operate if there is at least one radial location in the model where the angular frequency of orbiting fluid elements resonates with the eigenfrequency of the identified special mode . a straightforward check of the radial rotational profiles @xmath58 of model",
    "* j250 * ( see figure [ fig : corotj250 ] ) shows that a corotation radius is present at @xmath59 for the unstable @xmath1 fourier mode with an eigenfrequency @xmath60 .",
    "( this measurement of the eigenfrequency was done for the pure hydrodynamical simulation , in which grr was turned off . )",
    "however , the result from one model is not sufficient for us to draw a definite conclusion . to further clarify the relationship between the instability and corotation points",
    ", we performed a number of simulations on different polytropic neutron star models . in these additional simulations",
    ", we will concentrate only on hydrodynamic simulations with grr turned off , because grr - related instabilities generally would set in on a much longer time scale and therefore are irrelevant here .",
    "so far we have identified a corotation point associated with the one - armed spiral instability in model * j250*. it would be interesting to find out if the instability disappears when there is no such corotation point . in order to test this , we chose to evolve model * j133*. this model is rotating slowly enough so that the central angular frequency is well below the eigenfrequency of the @xmath1 mode that arose in model * j250*. by removing the corotation points of the @xmath1 mode inside model * j133 * , it was hoped that the one - armed instability would not show up in this evolution . to eliminate the possible influence of the degree of differential rotation",
    ", we kept the value of the parameter @xmath28 the same as in model * j250 * , but increased the polar radius @xmath32 to slow down the rotation of the star .",
    "note that the eigenfrequency of the @xmath1 mode for this model is actually unknown , but we estimate it would not change dramatically compared to that of model * j250*. ( in fact , as shown by later simulations , @xmath61 in model * j250 * and * j127 * are very close to each other ; see table [ table : freq ] . )    as shown in the top panel of figure [ fig : mode133 ] , the @xmath1 fourier amplitude @xmath62 does not grow into the nonlinear regime in this case .",
    "it develops somewhat , but only hangs on at a very small amplitude . on the other hand , the @xmath6 mode seems to gain some strength in the beginning of the evolution , but it quickly saturates at a very low amplitude and never enters into the nonlinear regime .",
    "the density contours shown in the bottom panels of figure [ fig : mode133 ] also display no indication of nonaxisymmetric structure .",
    "the lack of development of the @xmath1 spiral mode in this simulation supports our conjecture that corotation points are directly responsible for the excitation of the mode .",
    "although the evolution of model * j133 * makes our argument about corotation points plausible , the fact that its @xmath11 value is significantly lower than model * j250 * raised the following question : is it the low @xmath11 value that suppressed the instability ? to answer this question and as a further check of our conjecture , model * j127 * was evolved in the same fashion as model * j133*. this model has a @xmath11 value that is similar to that of model * j133 * , but its degree of differential rotation was made very high by reducing the value of @xmath28 . with this steep rotational profile , we hoped that a corotation point for the @xmath1 mode would exist within the star and , hence , trigger the instability .",
    "the final outcome of this evolution is perhaps the most striking and interesting one .",
    "as shown in the top panel of figure [ fig : mode127 ] , the evolution can be divided into three stages : ( 1 ) in the first @xmath63 , an @xmath6 mode grows exponentially , but it saturates very quickly ; ( 2 ) @xmath64 later , an unexpected @xmath3 mode comes into play , and becomes dominant for quite a long time .",
    "the pear - shaped @xmath3 density distortion is visible in the bottom left - hand panel of figure [ fig : mode127 ] ; ( 3 ) after @xmath65 , the originally expected @xmath1 mode catches up and wins over .    given previous studies of the low @xmath11 bar - mode instability @xcite , the appearance of the @xmath6 mode here is not surprising .",
    "however , the appearance of an @xmath3 mode in axisymmetric equilibrium stellar models with intermediate @xmath11 values is totally unexpected . a plot of the rotational profile of model * j127 * is shown in figure [ fig : corotj127 ] and reveals the existence of corotation radii for all three of these unstable modes .",
    "these results are fully consistent with the linear analysis presented by @xcite : corotation instabilities in stellar models are not limited to @xmath1 and @xmath6 modes .",
    "other modes may become unstable as long as their corotation points exist inside the star . in this simulation",
    ", we also analyzed the behavior of the @xmath66 ( @xmath15 ) fourier component of the density distribution .",
    "it appears to follow the behavior of the @xmath6 ( @xmath14 ) mode , but it saturates at an amplitude that is two orders of magnitude lower .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath66 ( @xmath15 )  mode \" is actually a harmonic of @xmath6 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "there is no indication of the independent development of either an @xmath66 or @xmath15 mode .",
    "we suspect that the reason for the lack of independent m=4 and 5 modes is that their corotation radii fall outside the star .    because instabilities associated with different modes may arise in stars with strong differential rotation , the gravitational - wave signals from such an event would exhibit multiple characteristics .",
    "figure [ fig : gw_j127 ] shows the computed quadrupole gravitational - wave strain as viewed by an observer located along the + z axis and assuming the neutron star has a mass of @xmath67 and an equatorial radius of 12.5 km .",
    "the peak signal strength is actually stronger than the bounce signal expected from the axisymmetric core collapse of massive stars , which has been shown to produce signals with @xmath68 cm at a frequency @xmath69 hz @xcite .",
    "the signal also has some distinct features .",
    "there is more than one localized burst , arising from different modes peaking at different times and in different frequency bands : the first , centered at @xmath70 , corresponds to @xmath71 @xmath72 500 cm at a frequency @xmath73 hz emitted by the @xmath6 mode ; the second , centered at @xmath74 , corresponds to @xmath75 cm at a frequency @xmath76 hz associated with the @xmath3 mode ; the third , centered at @xmath77 , corresponds to a @xmath78 cm at frequency @xmath79 hz emitted by the @xmath6 harmonic of the @xmath1 spiral mode .",
    "figure [ fig : freq_j127 ] shows the pattern frequencies of all the dominating unstable modes as a function of time . to make the graph clean ,",
    "the frequencies of the @xmath1 and @xmath80 modes are only shown in the time intervals when they dominate , and all the data at times @xmath81 have been omitted because they appear to be noisy due to the lack of coherent modes .",
    "it is observed that the pattern frequencies of all three modes  @xmath82 , and @xmath83  are fairly constant throughout their peroid of dominance and the uncertainty in these measurements is @xmath84 .",
    "hence , the relative location of the corotation radii @xmath85 for these various modes does not vary with time , unless a change in the rotational profile of the star causes @xmath85 to migrate .    based upon the above hydrodynamic simulations , we can now draw the following conclusions : ( 1 ) the @xmath1 instability can be turned on or off by controlling the rotational profile of the star to allow or remove the existence of a corotation point .",
    "( 2 ) the instability is not limited to the @xmath1 mode ; other modes may also arise , as long as their corotation points exist inside the star .      according to @xcite ,",
    "models with very small values of the rotation - profile parameter @xmath28 are subject to a low @xmath11 dynamical bar - mode instability .",
    "since the rotational profiles for these types of models are quite steep , it occurred to us that they may also allow corotation points for various modes within their structure .",
    "it also seemed likely that even one individual stellar model might be subject to instabilities associated not only with the @xmath6 bar - mode , but also other modes . in order to test this idea",
    ", we evolved model * j068 * with @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) , which falls in the instability region where the low @xmath11 dynamical bar - mode instability would be expected to set in .",
    "the results of this simulation support our suspicion that an individual model with a very steep rotational profile may be subject to multiple instabilities associated with different azimuthal modes . as shown in the top panel of figure [ fig : mode068 ] , at the beginning of this simulation the @xmath6 bar - mode grew very quickly , became nonlinear , and dominated the evolution for quite a while , which is consistent with the results presented by @xcite .",
    "in addition , however , we found that the underlying @xmath1 and @xmath14 modes also grew simultaneously .",
    "these odd - numbered modes had growth rates rather slower than the @xmath6 mode , but this did not keep the @xmath1 mode from finally winning over all the other modes , including the bar - mode , and manifesting itself as the dominant mode , just as it did in our earlier simulations . notice that , again , the amplitude of the @xmath6 mode increases when the @xmath1 mode becomes dominant at late times , which suggests that the @xmath6 mode is a harmonic of the @xmath1 mode during this period .",

    "this is in contrast to the work of @xcite , which has suggested that such instabilities can arise only in stars with a softer eos .",
    "as has been suggested by @xcite , the instability seems to be associated with the existence of a corotation point of the @xmath1 mode that lies inside the star . given previous results for models with a softer eos ,",
    "we conclude that the compressibility and @xmath11 value of the star are not directly responsible for triggering the instability .",
    "we have discovered that , in addition to the @xmath1 mode , other higher - order modes also are allowed to come into play within a single model as long as corotation points for these modes also exist within the star .",
    "this can happen as long as the rotational profile is sufficiently steep .",
    "in our @xmath0 polytropic neutron star models , these modes grow relatively slowly compared to previous results for softer eoss @xcite , but nevertheless they appear to be dynamically unstable .",
    "such modes are likely to develop in newly born neutron stars because young neutron stars are expected to have strong differential rotation @xcite .",
    "also , because they develop in low @xmath11 configurations on a dynamical time scale , these modes are likely to be more important than the often - discussed secular bar - mode instability .",
    "this will have important consequences for the detection of gravitational - waves by the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) , because gravitational - waves generated in such systems would not be monochromatic ; our simulations indicate that signals with different characteristic frequencies are likely to peak at different times .",
    "we suspect that these corotation - related instabilities have not been identified in previous studies of models that have a stiff eos because earlier studies have been focused on a search for , or the analysis of , instabilities that develop on a very short time scale .",
    "most previous simulations have been followed through only a few tens of @xmath50 , which is not a long enough time to permit significant amplification of many of the modes we have identified in this study . only in this study  which was initially aimed at examining the secular bar - mode instability in stars with differential rotation ",
    "have models been evolved long enough to reveal the corotation instabilities that grow on a longer time scale for this stiff eos case .",
    "based on theoretical analyses of differentially rotating configurations that have been presented by others , we suspect that , in addition to the existence of corotation points , a resonant cavity is required in order to drive corotation instabilities to very large amplitude . in particular , @xcite have suggested that a local minimum in the radial vortensity profile can serve as a resonant cavity to trap waves and , hence , trigger a `` rossby wave '' instability .",

    "( the vortensity plotted here is the ratio between vorticity and volume density , but the same radial profile is preserved even if we define vortensity as the ratio between vorticity and surface density . )",
    "as these figures show , a fairly wide dip encompasses the corotation radii of all of the modes that we have found to be unstable in these models .",
    "we note that such a dip in the radial vortensity profile is a common feature for all of our unstable models .",
    "we suspect that waves are trapped inside these vortensity cavities and are continously amplified through multiple passages across their respective corotation radii . because an off - axis density maximum alone will generate a vortensity minimum and hence form a resonant cavity that can trap waves inside",
    ", it is perhaps not surprising that toroidal structures frequently have been found to be unstable to a one - armed , spiral instability @xcite .",
    "however , our new results show that a toroidal structure is not necessary to generate a vortensity minimum ; strong differential rotation alone can create a vortensity minimum , as indicated for example by our model * j068 * which does not have a toroidal structure .    we have also noticed that an unstable mode whose corotation radius falls at a position that is deeper in the vortensity well has a higher growth rate in any given simulation .",
    "figures [ fig : vort_j068 ] and [ fig : vort_j127 ] , in conjunction with the data provided in table [ table : freq ] , reveal this correlation between the growth rate of each mode and the depth of its corotation radius inside the vortensity well .",
    "this correlation is consistent with the results reported by @xcite from a study of the rossby - wave instability in differentially rotating thin disks .",
    "they discovered that the growth rate of the rossby - wave instability was proportional to the amplitude of density bumps / jumps that were introduced into their models , in other words , proportional to the depth of the vortensity wells that were created by such density jumps .",
    "according to @xcite , requiring a minimum to be present in a star s radial vortensity profile before the star can become susceptible to a corotation instability is a generalization of the rayleigh inflexion point theorem , which states that a necessary condition for an instability of this type to develop is that there be an inflection point in the velocity profile @xcite . given the j - constant - like rotation law ( eq .  [ eq : jconst ] ) adopted in our ( as well as previous ) studies , the condition @xmath88 can be evaluated analytically to show that a velocity inflection point arises at @xmath89 .",
    "hence , for a sufficiently shallow rotational profile having @xmath90 , the required inflection point does not exist inside the star .",
    "this may also explain why low @xmath11 instabilities only show up in stars with strong differential rotation ( smaller values of @xmath28 ) .",
    "finally , in an effort to draw a further connection between our results and previous analyses , we have examined the azimuthal structure of the unstable eigenmodes in our models .",
    "figure [ fig : phase_j250 ] displays the phase angle of the @xmath1 mode as a function of @xmath33 in the equatorial plane of model * j250*. the pattern shows a slightly trailing segment in the innermost region , then transforms itself into a leading wave outside the density maximum , and finally a loosely wound , trailing segment appears again outside the corotation radius .",
    "this particular characteristic is reminiscent of the @xmath1 structure that was observed in an earlier study of papaloizou - pringle modes by @xcite , and it is quite similar to the azimuthal structure of the one - armed spiral mode discussed by @xcite . in contrast , figure [ fig : phase_j068 ] shows the phase - angle plot of the @xmath6 mode for model * j068*. no spiral structure is observed for the @xmath6 mode ; instead , the phase angles at different radii are roughly aligned along a straight line indicating a purely bar - like deformation .",
    "the radial eigenfunction of the @xmath1 mode shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : drhoj250 ] is not monotonic and has a node between the center and the surface ; we suspect it belongs to the family of papaloizou - pringle modes that arises in pressure - supported tori and thick accretion disks .",
    "the nodeless feature of the radial eigenfunctions for @xmath91 modes suggests that they might be f - mode oscillations ( this interpretation is consistent with the unstable mode structure presented by @xcite ) ; but their structures are different in details : the eigenfunction of the @xmath6 mode ( seen in * j068 * ) starts from zero at the center , monotonically increases outward , and reaches a maximum amplitude near the surface ; in contrast , the eigenfunction of the @xmath3 mode ( seen in * j127 * ) has a maximum between the center and the surface .",
