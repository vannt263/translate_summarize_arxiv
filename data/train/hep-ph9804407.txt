    "the experimental and theoretical investigations of the heavy flavored hadrons constitutes one of the main research area in particle physics .",
    "this is due their outstanding role in the precise determination of the fundamental parameters of the standard model ( sm ) , such as cabibbo ",
    "maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements , leptonic decay constants etc . , and for deeper understanding of the dynamics of qcd . in this sense ,",
    "@xmath1 mesons occupy an exceptional place .",
    "since @xmath1 mesons contain two heavy quarks , their decay channels are very rich compared to that of @xmath2 mesons",
    ". moreover , qcd predictions on @xmath1 meson decays are more reliable since for the heavy quarks perturbation theory works quite well . because of the above  mentioned reasons , the investigation of the properties of @xmath1 mesons receives special attention .",
    "production and different decay channels of @xmath1 mesons are widely discussed in the current literature ( for a review , see @xcite ) . in @xcite , the number of @xmath1 mesons that will be produced in lhc ,",
    "is estimated to be @xmath3 .",
    "this is clearly an indication of the real possibility of an experimental investigation of the properties of the @xmath1 mesons at lhc .",
    "in addition to that , the @xmath1 meson decay channels can bring about some background contribution to the @xmath4 meson decays , with the same final states @xcite , which is another reason that makes the precise study of the decay channels of @xmath1 mesons worthwhile .",
    "the pure leptonic decays of @xmath1 mesons are the simplest among all decays . in principle",
    "the pure leptonic decay @xmath5 can be used for the determination of the leptonic decay constant @xmath6 , which is one of the fundamental parameters of the hadron physics .",
    "but this type of decays are helicity suppressed by a factor of @xmath7 , and hence a precise determination of @xmath6 is difficult to make . on the other hand , although the @xmath8 channel is free of the above  mentioned helicity suppression , its observation is possible if we have good efficiency .",
    "when a photon is radiated in addition to the leptons , the helicity suppression is removed and a large branching ratio is expected , which is the reason why it makes the investigation of the @xmath9 decay much more interesting .",
    "note that , the @xmath9 decay is investigated in the sm within the context of the constituent quark model approach @xcite . but the concept of the `` constituent quark mass '' is itself poorly understood and its relation with qcd is unclear",
    ". therefore the prediction of the branching ratio within the context of the constituent quark model approach is strongly model dependent .",
    "our aim in this work is to investigate the @xmath9 decay in a model independent way , namely within the framework of the light cone qcd sum rules ( for a review on light cone qcd sum rules , see @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we derive the sum rules for the transition form factors , which appears in @xmath9 decay . in section 3",
    "we present the numerical analysis and give a brief discussion about the results .",
    "the @xmath5 decay at quark level is described by the tree level feynman diagram , which is presented in fig .",
    "the corresponding effective hamiltonian for the @xmath5 decay is = v_cb |c _ 1 - _ 5 b |_1 - _ 5  .",
    "as already noted , the pure leptonic process @xmath10 is helicity suppressed .",
    "if a photon is attached to any of the charged lines , no helicity suppression exists .",
    "however if a photon is attached to the charged lepton line , it follows from helicity arguments that the contribution of such a diagram must be proportional to the lepton mass @xmath11 , and hence it can safely be neglected . when a photon is radiated from @xmath12boson line , the contribution of this diagram is also strongly suppressed by a factor @xmath13 , since an extra @xmath14 factor comes from the second @xmath12boson propagator .",
    "therefore in @xmath9 , the main contribution should come from the diagrams , where photon is radiated from the initial quark lines .",
    "thus the corresponding matrix element for the @xmath9 process can be written as = ( q ) |c _ 1-_5 b b_c(p+q ) |_1-_5  .",
    "the matrix element @xmath15 describes the annihilation of the @xmath1 mesons into the current @xmath16 , with momentum @xmath17 accompanied by the radiation of a real photon with momentum @xmath18 .",
    "this matrix element can be written in terms of two independent , gauge invariant structures : ( q ) |c _ 1-_5 b b_c(p+q ) = e \\ { _ e^ * p^q^ + i }  , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the polarization and the four  momentum of the photon , respectively , @xmath17 is the momentum transfer , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the parity conserving and parity violating form factors .",
    "the main problem is to calculate the form factors @xmath21 and @xmath22 including their momentum dependence , and we will calculate these form factors in the framework of light cone @xmath23 sum rules method .",
    "we start with the following correlator function t_(p , q ) = i d^4 x e^ipx  .    we will present the calculation of this correlator in two different ways . in the first approach we sandwich @xmath24 in between the hadronic states with @xmath1 meson quantum numbers , and",
    "hence we get t_(p , q ) & = & e + & & \\ { _ e^ * p^q^ + i }  , where we have used b_c |b i _ 5 c 0 =  .",
    "the second alternative approach , on the other hand , is to calculate the correlator function ( 4 ) at large euclidean momentum , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are both large and negative .",
    "the lorentz decomposition of the correlator is t_(p , q ) = _ e^ * p^q^ t_1 + i t_2  .",
    "the @xmath1 meson contains two quarks which interact with the photon only perturbatively .",
    "this point is essentially different in the @xmath27 decay in which the photon interacts with the quarks both perturbatively and non  perturbatively ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "it is our aim now to calculate these perturbative contributions . for the invariant structures @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    ", we write the dispersion relation in variable @xmath26 at fixed @xmath25 .",
    "t^(1,2 ) = ds +  . here",
    "the superscript 1 and 2 corresponds to @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively .",

    "hadron duality in order to subtract continuum contribution , which modeled as perturbation contribution starting from some threshold @xmath41 and finally perform the borel transformation in the variable @xmath42 .",
    "this operation is necessary to suppress higher states and continuum contributions . as a result",
    "we arrive at the following sum rules for the form factors @xmath21 and @xmath22 : + & &  , +   +   +   + & & \\ { m_b q_b + & & + m_c q_b + & & + m_b q_c + & & + m_c q_c }  , where in eqs .",

    "( 12 ) and ( 13 ) , the resulting expressions are expected to coincide with the form factors corresponding only to the perturbative part of the @xmath27 decay .",
    "this decay was investigated in @xcite , and their results are identical to ours in the @xmath43 limit .",
    "the calculation for the differential decay rate yields = v_bc ^2 m_b_c^3 x 1-x ^3  , where @xmath44 .",
    "the corresponding decay width which follows from the above expression is = v_bc ^2 m_b_c^3 _ 0 ^ 1 x 1-x ^3 dx  .",
    "in regard to the numerical analysis in the evaluation of the form factors , we have used the following set of parameters : @xmath45 @xcite , @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xcite .    in fig .",

    "we see that the best stability is achieved in the range @xmath51 for which an uncertainty less than @xmath52 is observed . the analysis for @xmath53 yields similar results as well",
    ".    the sum rules of the type ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) are expected to work in the region @xmath54 few @xmath55 , which is smaller than the maximal available @xmath56 . to extend our results to the whole region of @xmath25",

    "it is observed from this figure that the photon spectra @xmath59 is practically symmetric .",
    "note that the quark model approach also predicts a symmetric spectra for the photon ( see fig . 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we summarize the numerical results of the branching ratios . taking @xmath60 @xcite , @xmath61 @xcite , we get b_c |= 1.0 10 ^ -5  . here",
    "we note that the quark model approach yields @xcite b_c |= 5.0 10 ^ -5  .",

    "for completeness we present the predictions of the branching ratios for the pure leptonic decays @xcite : b_c |_&= & 6.0 10 ^ -5  , + b b_c e |_e & = & 1.4 10 ^ -9  . from a comparison of eqs . ( 18 ) and ( 20 ) , we observe that the branching ratio of the radiative leptonic decay is of same order with the corresponding pure leptonic decay ( i.e. , for @xmath65 case ) .",
