    "the investigation of relativistic cosmological models usually has the energy momentum tensor of matter generated by a perfect fluid . to consider more realistic models one must take into account the viscosity mechanisms , which have already attracted the attention of many researchers @xcite .",
    "the nature of cosmological solutions for homogeneous bianchi type i ( bi ) model was investigated by belinsky and khalatnikov @xcite by taking into account dissipative process due to viscosity . in @xcite",
    "we reinvestigate the problem posed in @xcite in presence of a @xmath0 term . though that murphy @xcite claimed that the introduction of bulk viscosity can avoid the initial singularity at finite past , but belinsky and khalatnikov @xcite showed that viscosity can not remove the cosmological singularity but results in a qualitatively new behavior of the solutions near singularity . to eliminate the initial singularities a self - consistent system of nonlinear spinor and bi gravitational field was considered by us in a series of papers @xcite . for some cases we were able to find field configurations those were always regular .",
    "recently it was found that the introduction of a spinor field into the system may explain the late time acceleration of the universe , hence can be considered as an alternative to dark energy @xcite .    given the importance of viscous fluid and spinor field to construct a more realistic model of the universe , we in @xcite we introduced spinor field into the system and solved the system for some special choice of viscosity .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study an interacting system of spinor and scalar fields within the scope of a bianchi type i cosmological model filled with viscous fluid in presence of a @xmath0 term and clarify the role of viscosity and field interaction in the evolution of the universe .",
    "in this section we derive the fundamental equations for the interacting spinor , scalar and gravitational fields from the action and write their solutions in term of the volume scale @xmath1 defined bellow .",
