    "we consider in this work a cauchy problem for the following reaction - diffusion equation in one space dimension : @xmath0 supplemented with the initial condition @xmath1 here the function @xmath2 satisfies the periodicity condition @xmath3 for some @xmath4 .",

    "will be specified later .",
    "this result , in particular , implies the existence of pulsating traveling waves ( or a set of traveling waves ) under rather mild assumptions .",
    "+ we now state our main assumptions . the first one is concerned with the attractiveness of @xmath8 with respect to at least one compactly supported initial data .",
    "our main theorems ( theorems  [ heavip2 ] and  [ heavip2-cv ] ) will only need this assumption :    [ assumption - p1 ] there exists a solution @xmath11 of - with compactly supported initial data @xmath12 that converges locally uniformly to @xmath8 as @xmath13 .",
    "this assumption covers a wide variety of nonlinearities that include not only such standard ones as monostable , bistable or combustion nonlinearities , but also much more general and complex ones .",
    "for instance , it even allows an infinite number of stationary solutions between 0 and @xmath8 . in this paper",
    ", we will show that this rather weak condition is in fact sufficient for deriving our main results on the convergence to a propagating terrace .",
    "the next assumption guarantees that our propagating terrace consists of a single ( pulsating ) traveling wave .",
    "thus , under this additional assumption , our main results imply the existence of a pulsating traveling wave , as well as the convergence of solutions to this traveling wave ( theorem  [ heavip1 ] ) :    [ assumption - p2 ] there exists no @xmath5-periodic stationary solution @xmath14 with @xmath15 that is both isolated from below and stable from below with respect to .",
    "let us clarify the notions introduced in this assumption . a stationary solution @xmath14 of is said to be * isolated from below * ( resp .",

    "nonnegative ) perturbations .",
    "otherwise , @xmath14 is called * unstable from below * ( resp . * above * ) .",

    "furthermore , @xmath10 is unstable from above .",
    "the stationary solution @xmath10 is stable from above with respect to , and @xmath8 is stable from below with respect to .",

    "furthermore , there exists no stationary solution @xmath14 satisfying @xmath26 for all @xmath27 .",
    "a classical example of the bistable nonlinearity is the allen - cahn nonlinearity @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "an important subclass of the monostable nonlinearity is the kpp type nonlinearity , in which @xmath10 is assumed to be linearly unstable and @xmath31 is sublinear with respect to @xmath11 ; a typical example being @xmath32 , with @xmath33 .",
    "kpp type equations have been widely studied , even in the periodic setting , by numerous authors including @xcite .",
    "while most of those studies rely heavily on the linear instability of @xmath10 , our approach in the present paper largely avoid the need for linear analysis , allowing our results to be applicable even to strongly degenerate situations that have not been treated before .",
    "we now introduce some notions which will play a fundamental role in this paper .",
    "we begin with the following :    [ def : steep ] let @xmath34 be two entire solutions of .",
    "we say that @xmath35 is * steeper than * @xmath36 if for any @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 in @xmath40 such that @xmath41 , we have either @xmath42    here , by an  entire solution \" we mean a solution that is defined for all @xmath43 .",
    "the above property implies that the graph of the solution @xmath35 ( at any chosen time moment @xmath37 ) and that of the solution @xmath36 ( at any chosen time moment @xmath38 ) can intersect at most once unless they are identical , and that if they intersect at a single point , then @xmath44 is positive on the left - hand side of the intersection point , while negative on the right - hand side .",
    "note that , according to this definition , if the ranges of @xmath35 and @xmath36 are disjoint , then @xmath35 and @xmath36 are steeper than each other , since their graphs never intersect .    [ def : puls ] given two distinct periodic stationary states @xmath45 and @xmath46 , by a * pulsating traveling wave solution * ( or * pulsating traveling front * ) of connecting @xmath45 to @xmath46 , we mean any entire solution @xmath11 satisfying , for some @xmath47 , @xmath48 for any @xmath22 and @xmath49 , along with the asymptotics @xmath50 where the convergence is understood to hold locally uniformly in the space variable .",
    "the ratio @xmath51 is called the * average speed * ( or simply the  * speed * ) of this pulsating traveling wave .",
    "one can easily check that , for any @xmath52 , @xmath53 is a pulsating traveling wave connecting @xmath45 to @xmath46 with speed @xmath54 if and only if it can be written in the form @xmath55 , where @xmath56 satisfies @xmath57 along with the following equation that is equivalent to : @xmath58    let us recall some known results on traveling waves from the literature .",
    "in the case of spatially homogeneous problems , existence of traveling waves is well studied ( see for instance @xcite for a review of the area ) . more precisely , in the kpp case , there exists a continuum of admissible speeds @xmath59 , while in the bistable or combustion cases , the admissible speed is unique .",
    "stability and convergence to those traveling waves are also studied extensively . among other things , in the one - dimensional kpp case ( or , more generally , the monostable case ) , uchiyama  @xcite , bramson  @xcite and lau  @xcite proved that solutions of the cauchy problem with compactly supported initial data converge to the traveling front with minimal speed as @xmath60 . in this case",
    ", the solution does not converge to the traveling wave with an asymptotic phase , but a phase drift of order  @xmath61 occurs  @xcite .",
    "similar results hold for multi - dimensional problems as long as the parameters of the equation are invariant in the direction of propagation  @xcite .    in the case of spatially periodic problems , the state of research is slightly behind , for obvious technical difficulties . nonetheless , in the kpp case , the existence of a continuum of admissible speeds is well established , as in the case of spatially homogeneous problems .",
    "it is also known that there is a close relation between the speed of a traveling wave @xmath62 and its decay rate as @xmath63 , at least under some assumptions on the linearized problem around  @xmath10 ; the smaller the speed  @xmath54 , the faster the decay ; hence steeper the front profile .",
    "convergence to those traveling waves was studied in @xcite in a periodic framework .",
    "more precisely , it has been shown that if the initial data has the same exponential decay as a given traveling wave as @xmath64 , then the solution of the cauchy problem converges to this traveling wave as @xmath18 .",
    "however , the case of very fast decaying initial data ( for instance , a heaviside or a compactly supported function ) has been left open up to now in the periodic framework , although the appearance of some phase drift of order  @xmath61 has also been highlighted in  @xcite .",
    "let us now come back to the main theme of the present paper  a propagating terrace . as we mentioned earlier",
    ", a traveling wave is a special case of a propagating terrace , but the latter is a more suitable notion for describing typical frontal behaviors in equations of multistable nature .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to study properties of propagating terraces in a spatially periodic setting , thereby generalizing ( and improving ) some of the aforementioned results on pulsating traveling waves .",
    "[ def : terrace ] a * propagating terrace * connecting @xmath10 to @xmath8 is a pair of finite sequences @xmath65 and @xmath66 such that :    * each @xmath67 is an @xmath5-periodic stationary solution of satisfying @xmath68 * for each @xmath69 , @xmath70 is a pulsating traveling wave solution of connecting @xmath67 to @xmath71 . *",
    "the speed @xmath72 of each @xmath70 satisfies @xmath73 .",

    ", a propagating terrace can be pictured as a layer of several traveling fronts going at various speeds , the lower the faster ( figure  [ fig : terrace ] ) .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to show that the solution of with heaviside - type initial data will converge to a minimal propagating terrace , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : terrace - like ] .        in some standard problems such as the kpp and the bistable equations ,",
    "the terrace actually consists of a single front ( that is , @xmath78 ) , which means that the solution will eventually look like a single traveling wave ; see theorem [ heavip1 ] .",
    "however , in more general equations , one can not expect such simple dynamics , and this is where the notion of terrace plays a fundamental role .",
    "the existence of a multi - step terrace has been known in the spatially homogeneous case ( where @xmath79 ) .",
    "let us give a simple example .",
    "consider @xmath31 as in figure  [ fig : f_terrace ] ( left ) , which is kpp on @xmath80 $ ] , and bistable on @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "the speed of the upper part of the solution is bounded from above by the speed , say @xmath54 , of the traveling wave for the bistable nonlinearity @xmath82}$ ] . on the other hand , the lower part of the solution is pushed from behind by a spreading front for the kpp nonlinearity @xmath83}$ ]",
    ", whose speed is known to approach @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath85 , the upper and lower parts of the solution necessarily move at two distinct speeds .",
    "[ fig : fterrace ]   that produce a multi - step terrace , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=90.0% ]    another example was exhibited by fife and mcleod in  @xcite , where they considered a specific case of a non - degenerate tristable nonlinearity , that is , when @xmath86}$ ] and @xmath87}$ ] are both bistable for some @xmath88 , and that @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are all strictly negative ; see figure  [ fig : f_terrace ] ( right ) .",
    "they showed that if the speed of the upper bistable part is smaller than the speed of the lower bistable part , then there does not exist any single front connecting @xmath10 to @xmath92 .",
    "furthermore , some solutions of the cauchy problem , in particular for heaviside type initial data , converge to a combination of those two fronts .",
    "this may be seen as an early study of a propagating terrace for some very specific examples .",
    "although the method in @xcite was expected to hold for homogeneous nonlinearities composed of a finite number of bistable parts , it relied strongly on the particular shape of @xmath31 , and on the non - degeneracy of the equilibria .",
    "this means that they needed some important a priori knowledge on the shape of the nonlinearity , which we do not need in the present paper .",
    "more importantly , what makes our work different from those early observations is that we are not simply giving examples of propagating terraces but are establishing the ubiquity of such terraces for large classes of reaction nonlinearities , thus showing that the notion of propagating terrace is fundamental for studying the dynamics of fronts in general reaction - diffusion equations .",
    "we consider solutions of - whose initial data are given in the form @xmath93 where @xmath94 is any constant , and @xmath95 denotes the heaviside function , which is defined by @xmath96 hereafter , for each @xmath97 , we denote by @xmath98 such solutions",
    ". we will prove that @xmath99 converges in some sense to a minimal propagating terrace as @xmath60 .",
    "[ heavip2 ] let assumption  [ assumption - p1 ] hold . then there exists a propagating terrace @xmath100 that is minimal in the sense of definition  [ def : terrace ] . such a minimal propagating terrace is unique , in the sense that any minimal propagating terrace shares the same  @xmath101 and that @xmath70 is unique up to time - shift for each @xmath102 .",
    "moreover , it satisfies :    a.   for any @xmath103 , the @xmath5-periodic stationary solution @xmath67 is isolated and stable from below with respect to",
    ". b.   all the @xmath67 and @xmath70 are steeper than any other entire solution of .",
    "the existence of a minimal terrace as stated in the above theorem gives various useful information about the qualitative properties of the equation .",
    "for example , statement  @xmath104 implies , in particular , that there exists no traveling wave that intersects any of the  @xmath67 . note",
    "that , in the spatially homogeneous case ( namely , @xmath79 ) , the stability of @xmath67 in statement @xmath105 implies that each @xmath67 is a constant ; hence the terrace consists of flat steps .",
    "we now state our convergence result :    [ heavip2-cv ] let assumption  [ assumption - p1 ] hold .",
    "then for any @xmath106 , the solution @xmath107 converges as @xmath18 to the minimal propagating terrace @xmath100 in the following sense :    a.   there exist functions @xmath108 with @xmath109 as @xmath18 such that @xmath110 locally uniformly on @xmath40 , @xmath72 being the speed of @xmath70 .",

    "it should be noted that , under assumption [ assumption - p1 ] , there may exist an infinite number of isolated stationary solutions between @xmath10 and @xmath8 , but our theorem [ heavip2 ] states that only a finite number of layers appear in the limiting terrace .",
    "the solution seems to ignore excessive complexity of such nonlinearities .",
    "the proofs of theorems [ heavip2 ] and [ heavip2-cv ] are , in a sense , one and the same .",
    "in fact , by first showing that the steepness of the heaviside type initial data implies that the limiting profile of the solution is steeper than any other entire solution , we will then use this fact to prove the convergence of the solution to a minimal terrace without assuming the existence of a terrace .",
    "hence it automatically implies the existence of a minimal terrace .    in the special case where assumption  [ assumption - p2 ] also holds , the above two theorems reduce to the following result on pulsating traveling waves .",
    "thus it gives a new and highly original proof for the existence of pulsating traveling waves .",
    "[ heavip1 ] let assumptions [ assumption - p1 ] and  [ assumption - p2 ] hold . then there exists a pulsating traveling wave @xmath117 connecting @xmath10 to @xmath8 with speed @xmath118 that is steeper than any other entire solution between @xmath10 and @xmath8 . furthermore , for any @xmath106 , there exists a function @xmath119 with @xmath120 as @xmath121 such that @xmath122    let us make some comments on theorem [ heavip1 ] , which is a special case of the previous two theorems . as regards the existence part ,",
    "there have been earlier studies of the existence of pulsating traveling waves for monostable ( possibly degenerate ) and combustion cases @xcite , as well as for some periodic bistable case @xcite .",
    "in contrast to those earlier results , which are derived by various different methods depending on the type of nonlinearities , our theorem relies on a new , unified and rather straightforward proof , thus avoiding to deal directly with the particular features and difficulties of each case .    as mentioned earlier , the convergence result for fast decaying initial data such as our heaviside type ones was previously known only in the homogeneous setting .",
    "indeed , even in the standard kpp case with spatially periodic coefficients , almost all the convergence results in the literature are concerned with solutions whose initial data have roughly the same decay rate as one of the traveling waves near @xmath123 .",
    "only very recently , there are some works in progress that are trying to deal with some fast decaying initial data  @xcite .",
    "note that , though our results cover a large class of equations , they are concerned only with a specific type of inital data .",
    "however , by analogy with the homogeneous case ( see for instance the proofs in  @xcite ) , we expect that similar convergence results hold for more general initial data , such as compactly supported ones .",
    "this is a topic of particular relevance from an applied point of view , and we will give a partial answer to this question in a forthcoming paper  @xcite .",

    "this means that they are either identical ( up to time shift ) or strictly ordered , that is , one is above or below the other .",
    "this observation is important both for establishing convergence results and for the construction of a multi - step terrace .    here",
    "we note that the definition of the @xmath124-limit set in this paper is slightly different from the standard one , in that we consider arbitrary spatial translations while taking the limit as @xmath126 ; see definition [ def : omegalimit ] .",
    "the reason for adopting this slightly non - standard defintion is that , since each step of the terrace moves at a different speed , we can not capture the asymptotic profile of the solution in a single frame .",
    "a multi - speed observation is unavoidable in the case of a multi - step terrace . in the last part of section  [ sec : preliminaries ]",

    "but we have just shown that @xmath67 is isolated from below , therefore similarly as we have done before in the case @xmath496 to begin our iteration , for any @xmath308 close enough to @xmath497 , @xmath367 is a pulsating traveling wave connecting some stationary solution @xmath498 to @xmath67 .",
    "let us argue by contradiction and assume that it is not .",
    "since the sequence @xmath499 is monotonically decreasing , it converges uniformly to some @xmath500 , a periodic stationary solution of . as in the proof of lemma  [ iteration - terrace ]",
    ", we use a super - solution crossing some @xmath67 to get a contradiction .        let us now introduce the following function @xmath507 wherein @xmath508 , @xmath466 and @xmath509 is a solution of . using the same computations as in the proof of lemma  [ iteration - terrace ] , one gets that @xmath510 for all @xmath473 small enough , on some domain of the form @xmath511 , wherein @xmath427 moves with the average speed @xmath54 and satisfies for some @xmath102 large enough and any @xmath49 : @xmath512 as @xmath513 as @xmath63 uniformly with respect to @xmath49",
    ", one can proceed as before to reach a contradiction together with claim  [ supersolpk ] .",
    "in fact , we have not yet proven that the sequence @xmath516 of the speeds of the pulsating traveling waves @xmath70 is nondecreasing .",
    "however , this directly follows from lemma  [ iteration - terrace ] .",
    "indeed lemma  [ iteration - terrace ] also states that we have a decreasing sequence @xmath517 such that @xmath518 then , from remark  [ cvtaukspeed ] , the speed @xmath72 of @xmath70 can be obtained as @xmath519 and since @xmath520 is increasing for any @xmath521 and @xmath522 ( see remark [ rem : period ] ) , one obtains that the sequence @xmath72 is nondecreasing .    to conclude the proof of theorem  [ heavip2 ] , it remains to check that the propagating terrace @xmath515 satisfies all the required statements .",
    "this is in fact straightforward from all the above .",
    "part  @xmath105 indeed immediately follows from the construction of the terrace and lemma  [ iteration - terrace ] .",
    "part  @xmath104 follows from claim  [ walphapk ] and the construction of the @xmath70 as some @xmath124-limit orbits of @xmath99 .    moreover",
    ", one can easily check that @xmath515 is minimal .",
    "indeed , let us argue by contradiction by assuming that it is not .",
    "then , one can easily check that there exists some @xmath102 and some traveling wave @xmath523 crossing @xmath67 .",
    "this contradicts the fact that it is steeper than any other entire solution .",
    "lastly , let us check that any other minimal propagating terrace @xmath524 is equal to @xmath515 .",
    "let @xmath525 be a given other minimal propagating terrace .",
    "then it immediately follows from the definition that the two sequences @xmath526 and @xmath101 are identically equal .",

    "let us first show the locally uniform convergence to the pulsating traveling waves @xmath528 along the moving frames with speed @xmath72 and some sublinear drifts .",
    "let us fix some @xmath69 .",
    "for any large enough @xmath19 , let us define @xmath529 such that @xmath530 and let us introduce @xmath531 wherein @xmath532 is defined as in section  [ cvpulswave ] , with @xmath533 chosen so that @xmath534 . let us now consider @xmath535 , the piecewized affine function , defined by @xmath536 recall that the sequence @xmath537 converges to @xmath538 , so that @xmath539 as @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath540 where the above convergence is understood to hold locally uniformly with respect to @xmath541 , and since @xmath542 and @xmath543 stay bounded , one can check that @xmath544 thus , we obtain @xmath545 wherein both of the above convergences hold locally uniformly with respect to  @xmath27 .",
    "this completes , in the general case , the convergence result stated in theorem  [ heavip2-cv ] .",

    "this will follow from the following monotonicity property :         + let us first look on the left of the terrace , that is , when @xmath549 . in that case , we will use the fact that @xmath550 let @xmath111 be a given small enough number . from the asymptotics of @xmath551 ,",
    "there exists  @xmath552 such that for all @xmath19 : @xmath553 next for each time large enough one has for all @xmath554 $ ] : @xmath555 then , using claim  [ claim : period - mon ] , one gets for all large enough @xmath19 : @xmath556    one can proceed similarly to get that for any @xmath111 , there exists @xmath557 such that for any @xmath558 , @xmath559 note that under assumption  [ assumption - p2 ] , since @xmath78 , the uniform convergence   immediately follows from the above computations .",
    "+ lastly , let @xmath69 be a given integer",
    ". then one has @xmath560 as above , one can use claim  [ claim : period - mon ] to show that there exists some constant @xmath112 such that for each large time @xmath19 : @xmath561 @xmath562 this ends the proof of theorem  [ heavip2-cv ] ."
