    "@xcite performed transport measurements on a si - metal - oxide - semiconductor structure in which a degenerate gas of electrons was electrostatically induced .",
    "their work demonstrated for the first time that the density of states in the @xmath1-type electron inversion layer had the expected behaviour for a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) . since fowler s seminal work",
    ", the exploitation of the electronic properties of iii - v semiconductors has led to the realization of high quality , high mobility 2deg s at the interface of epitaxially grown iii - v structures , such as gaas / algaas heterostructures .",
    "@xcite through electrostatic , and/or etching techniques , the 2deg found in the iii - v semiconductor interface , can be manipulated to create experimental realizations of low dimensional electron systems such as quantum wires , quantum dots and quantum anti - dots .    by far , the workhorse for a theoretical understanding of the bulk electronic properties of such low - dimensional electronic systems is the zero - temperature ( @xmath2 ) density - functional theory ( dft ) of hohenberg , kohn and sham ( hks ) .",
    "@xcite the key element in the hks approach is the definition of the kinetic energy ( ke ) , corresponding to a system of @xmath3 noninteracting fermions moving in some effective one - body potential .",
    "the hks scheme treats the ke _ exactly _ at the independent particle level , and so the development of explicit , orbital - free functionals for @xmath4 $ ] , the ke density functional , is an important objective . ideally the appropriate functional",
    "should yield both the correct energy _ and _ the correct density profile .    to this end ,",
    "the simplest approach for the construction of the ke density functional , @xmath4 $ ] , is the local - density approximation ( lda ) , sometimes referred to as the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation .",
    "@xcite in this approximation , the _ known _",
    "form for ke density functional of the _ uniform _ electron gas , is also used locally for the ke density functional of the _ inhomogeneous _ system .",
    "one would then expect the lda to be applicable only in cases where the density in the system is a slowly varying function of position .",
    "in fact , this is not the case , and even in highly inhomogeneous systems , the lda is found to work reasonably well .",
    "@xcite    although the lda for the ke density leads to reasonable results for the energy , the calculated density profile in a self - consistent dft scheme does not exhibit the desired quantum mechanical tunnelling into the classically forbidden region . to overcome this issue ,",
    "the so - called von weizscker ( vw ) gradient correction ,  @xcite @xmath5 , is added to the ke functional . in 3d",
    ", the vw gradient correction can be rigorously justified within the extended tf ( etf ) theory , originally developed in the context of nuclear physics .",
    "@xcite the inclusion of the vw term leads to smooth and continuous densities , while improving the quality of the ke functional by taking into account the inhomogeneity of the system .",
    "an application of the etf theory to 2d systems , however , leads to the conclusion that there are _ no gradient corrections _ to the 2d ke density functional .",
    "@xcite this , of course , makes no physical sense since the lda can not be variationally exact for an inhomogeneous system .",
    "thus in dft applications to systems derived from the inhomogeneous 2deg discussed above , a phenomenological approach must be taken in which a vw - like gradient correction is put in `` by hand '' .",
    "@xcite although the vw - like correction term is entirely _ ad hoc _ for a 2d system , its use has been justified by ( i ) the ke reduces to the tf limit for slowly varying densities , and ( ii ) it allows one to represent strongly inhomogeneous densities in a quantum mechanically reasonable way .    to date , there has been no formal justification for the inclusion of a vw - like term for 2d systems at zero - temperature . in this paper",
    ", we establish the existence of a vw - like gradient correction to the 2d ke density functional at _ finite temperatures_. our approach parallels the earlier work of brack ,  @xcite in which the etf theory was developed in the context of `` hot '' nuclear matter ( etft ) .",
    "given the recent work of eschrig ,  @xcite which aims at providing a rigorous foundation for dft at finite - temperature , the results presented in this paper are immediately relevant to future applications of @xmath6 dft in low dimensional electronic systems .",
    "the rest of our paper is organized as follows . in the next section we provide a brief review of the general etft approach , followed by an explicit calculation of the @xmath6 second order gradient correction to the 2d ke functional . in sec .",
    "iii we numerically investigate the quality of the gradient corrected functional by comparing it to known , exact results , for an isotropic 2d harmonic oscillator at finite temperature .",
    "the paper concludes in sec .",
    "iv with a brief summary and suggestions for future investigations .",
    "in this section , we provide a brief review of the etft approach .",
    "the interested reader should refer to the ref .  [ ] for a detailed discussion of the etft and the wigner - kirkwood semiclassical expansion .      at the heart of the etft approach",

    "note that @xmath11 is to be viewed as a complex parameter here , and not the inverse temperature @xmath12 . in order to incorporate finite temperatures into the wk semiclassical theory ,",
    "the finite - temperature bdm is defined by  @xcite @xmath13 the finite - temperature spatial density is then obtained from an ( all two - sided ) inverse laplace transform ( ilt ) of the finite - temperature bdm , _ viz . ,",

    "( 3 ) accounts for the spin degeneracy after the spin trace has been taken , and @xmath15 has the physical significance of the chemical potential .",
    "it should be noted that if the _ exact _",
    "@xmath16 is known , then eq .  ( 3 ) will yield the exact , quantum mechanical , finite - temperature spatial density .",
    "of course , here , we are using a semiclassical expansion for @xmath16 , so the resulting @xmath17 will be the semiclassical spatial density .",
    "the ke density may be obtained from knowledge of the finite - temperature first - order density matrix ( fdm ) . to this end , it is useful to introduce the centre - of - mass , @xmath31 , and relative coordinates , @xmath32 , so that we may write three variants of the ke density :  @xcite @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 again , if the exact finite - temperature expression for the fdm is known , then eqs .  ( 810 ) will yield the exact , quantum mechanical finite - temperature ke density .    while all three of the above expressions for the ke density integrate to the exact same kinetic energy , @xmath36 is strictly positive definite , and is therefore sometimes preferred in applications of density functional theory .",
    "it has already been shown long ago that @xmath37 and @xmath38 generally have oscillations exactly opposite in phase , so that their mean , @xmath39 , is a smooth function . in this paper ,",
    "we focus on @xmath37 in order to make contact with earlier theoretical work done at zero - temperature , where the _ exact _ @xmath40 was investigated ( see also eq .  ( 26 ) in sec .",

    "@xcite as mentioned above , for physical densities , integration over @xmath79 vanishes .",
    "therefore , in any practical implementation of self - consistent @xmath2 dft , the laplacian term may be ignored , and we may write @xmath77 = { \\cal t}_{1,{\\rm etft}}[\\rho ] =   \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\left(\\pi \\rho^2\\right)~,\\ ] ] as @xmath80 .",
    "we see that there is no vw - like gradient correction at @xmath2 , leading to the incorrect conclusion that for an inhomogeneous 2d fermi gas , the tf ke functional ( at least to second - order ) is exact .",
    "@xcite we would like to stress again that the non - uniqueness of the ke density does not alter the result that there are no vw - like gradient corrections at @xmath2 ; the only differences between the @xmath2 semiclassical ke densities obtained from eqs .",

    "it is also interesting to note that the high - temperature limit of the tft term is linear in the density , @xmath84 , in contrast to the quadratic dependence , @xmath85 , exhibited in the zero - temperature limit .",
    "we have also checked that the high - temperature limit of the 2d ke functional may be obtained by performing an analogous calculation assuming a boltzmann , rather than a fermi , gas .",
    "in a previous study , brack and van zyl  @xcite examined the @xmath2 2d tf ke functional by comparing its global ( _ i.e. , _ integrated ) and local ( _ i.e. , _ spatially dependent ) properties with the known analytical expressions for the 2d harmonic oscillator ( ho ) potential .",
    "they found the remarkable result that at @xmath2 , the 2d tf ke functional ( _ without gradient corrections _ ) , when using the exact spatial density of the 2d ho , gives the exact quantum mechanical kinetic energy .",
    "this result is highly non - trivial because the tf functional is simply the lda to the true ke , and therefore , can not be variationally exact .",
    "more surprising , however , is how well the local behaviour of the exact ke density is reproduced by the tf approximation , as illustrated in fig .  3 of ref .",

    "first , we note that the tft ( dot - dashed curve , black online ) and the exact ke density ( solid curve , red online ) are almost indistinguishable within @xmath110 .",
    "however , near the tail region ( see figure inset ) , it is clear that the two ke densities are quite different ; the tft density is strictly positive definite , whereas the exact ke density falls below zero , before coalescing with the tft density for @xmath111 .",
    "the etft ke density ( dashed curve , blue online ) , on the other hand , does a relatively poor job of quantitatively capturing the behaviour of the exact ke density in the interior , but for the tail region , more accurately reproduces the exact result",
    ". indeed , for @xmath112 , the etft and exact ke densities are indistinguishable on the scale of the inset .",
    "moreover , in spite of the differences between the exact and etft densities for @xmath113 ,",
    "the etft is still a better approximation for the total ke , as evidenced by the data presented in table i. therefore , while the gradient corrections are important for improving the total ( _ i.e. , _ integrated ) ke , they are essential for describing the correct low - temperature behaviour of the exact ke past the classical turning point .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] presents the same data as in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , but with @xmath108 . at this temperature ,",
    "the shell oscillations are already completely washed out , and the exact and etft ke densities are _ indistinguishable _ from each other , including the tail region ; in the inset , there are actually three curves plotted , but the difference between the solid ( red online ) and dashed ( blue online ) curves can not be resolved .",
    "thus , at temperatures for which the shell effects are absent ( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath114 ) , the etft is an excellent approximation to the exact finite - temperature ke density .",
    "near the tail region , we see that the tft ke density ( dot - dashed curve , black online ) is consistently too large , thereby emphasizing the importance of the gradient corrections for a faithful description of the local behaviour of the exact ke density , even for small particle numbers .    finally , in fig .",

    "our numerical calculations have examined the quality of the tft and etft functionals by comparing them against exact , analytical results for the 2d ho potential .",
    "we find that gradient corrections lead to an improved agreement for total ke when compared to the tft approximation , and are necessary to correctly reproduce the quantum mechanical tunneling into the classically forbidden region exhibited by the exact ke density .",
    "unfortunately , the non - analytic behaviour of the @xmath2 semiclassical densities at the classical turning point can not be remedied within the present formalism .",
    "an extension of this work would be to develop the finite - temperature dirac exchange functional , which could then be used in a fully self - consistent , finite - temperature thomas - fermi - dirac von weizscker ( tfdw ) dft calculation similar to what has already been done at @xmath2 for low - dimensional fermi systems .  @xcite it would be interesting to see whether the optimal , _ ad hoc _ , @xmath2 vw coefficient of @xmath121 could be motivated from a finite - temperature self - consistent tfdw calculation .",
