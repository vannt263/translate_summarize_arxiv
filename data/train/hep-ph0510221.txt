    "these distributions parameterize matrix elements of non - local quark or gluon operators .",
    "we focus here on the unpolarized quark sector , where the distribution @xmath3 is diagonal in proton helicity and @xmath4 describes proton helicity flip . the variables @xmath5 and @xmath6 parameterize longitudinal quark momentum fractions relative to the average proton momentum @xmath7 as shown in fig .",

    "amplitudes remains an outstanding task , but generically the dominating values of @xmath5 in the loop integrals will be of order  @xmath6 .",
    "to represent gpds in transverse position space , we form wave packets @xmath15 from momentum eigenstates @xmath16 , where we write @xmath17 for the light - cone components and @xmath18 for the transverse part of a four - vector @xmath19 .",
    "the state @xmath20 is localized at @xmath21 in the transverse plane ( often called impact parameter plane ) .",
    "formally it is an eigenstate of a suitably defined transverse position operator @xcite .",
    "it is thus possible to localize a relativistic state exactly in _ two _ dimensions , whereas localization in all _ three _ dimensions involves ambiguities at the level of the compton wavelength . for a parton interpretation",
    "it is natural to consider states @xmath20 with large @xmath22 , which describe a fast - moving proton .",
    "further analysis reveals that @xmath21 is the `` center of momentum '' of the partons in the proton , given as @xmath23 in terms of their plus - momenta and transverse positions .",
    "the center of momentum is related by noether s theorem to transverse boosts , in analogy to the relation between the center of mass and galilean transformations in nonrelativistic mechanics .    taking matrix elements between impact parameter states ( [ impact - state ] ) of the quark or gluon operators defining general parton distributions in momentum space ,",

    "note that the connection between gpds and spatial distributions in the transverse plane discussed here differs from the well - known representation of form factors in terms of spatial distributions in _ three _ dimensions , which has been extended to gpds in  @xcite .    just as the ordinary parton densities , the distributions @xmath25",

    "an estimate for the overall transverse size of the proton in that limit is provided by the transverse distance @xmath38 between the struck quark and the center of momentum of the _ spectator _ partons , as shown in fig .",

    "electromagnetic form factors are sensitive to the difference of quark and antiquark distributions and thus insensitive to sea quarks and gluons , which can be accessed in processes like deeply virtual compton scattering or vector meson production .",
    "finally , parton momentum fractions only appear under an integral in elastic form factors , whereas a combined measurement of the @xmath6 and @xmath0 dependence in exclusive processes gives a more direct correlation of longitudinal and transverse variables as discussed in sect .",

    "furthermore , the value of @xmath54 measured in exclusive @xmath55 production , which involves the generalized gluon distribution , is smaller than the corresponding value for pomeron exchange in soft scattering processes @xcite .",

    "<S> the electromagnetic nucleon form factors provide constraints on generalized quark distributions . </S>",
    "<S> key results of the study presented here are a strong dependence of the average impact parameter of quarks on their longitudinal momentum fraction , a striking difference in the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath1 and @xmath2 quark contributions to elastic form factors , and an estimate of the orbital angular momentum carried by valence quarks in the nucleon . </S>"
