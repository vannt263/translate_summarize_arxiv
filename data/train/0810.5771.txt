    "scalar mesons have been a recurrent topic over the past 3040 years .",
    "whereas the existence of the @xmath14 has been a longstanding open question since the 1960s , the @xmath0 and @xmath15 were firmly established in @xmath16 scattering experiments in the 1970 s  @xcite .",
    "the known @xmath17 mesons fall into two classes : near and about 1  gev and in the region @xmath18  gev .",
    "the scalar objects below 1  gev form an @xmath19 flavor nonet  @xcite .",
    "this nonet contains two isosinglets , an isotriplet and two strange isodoublets . among these lighter scalars , the isosinglet @xmath0 and the isotriplet @xmath15 are rather narrow with their widths @xmath20 ranging from 40 to 100  mev  @xcite .",
    "both scalars strongly couple to the @xmath21 channel and lie close to its threshold at 987  mev .",
    "this closeness alters the shape of their resonant structure and the description of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 requires a coupled - channel scattering analysis .",
    "the simple quark model views these scalar mesons as orbitally ( @xmath24 ) excited @xmath25 states and has been advocated , for example , by trnqvist and roos  @xcite as well as in ref .",
    "however , some studies @xcite tend to favor four - quark configurations of the scalar mesons , as do coupled - channel analyses  @xcite or potential models of molecular states strongly coupled to @xmath16 and @xmath21 channels  @xcite .",
    "the emergence of the @xmath0 as a pole of the @xmath16 amplitude in the @xmath26 wave  @xcite is also well established in three - body decays of @xmath11 mesons  @xcite .",
    "recent @xmath16 effective mass range distributions , obtained from an isobar model fit of the @xmath27 and @xmath28 dalitz plots by the belle  @xcite and babar collaborations  @xcite , display distinct peaks about 1  gev .",
    "scalar resonances have also been observed in the charmed three - body decays @xmath29 at cleo  @xcite , focus  @xcite , argus  @xcite , babar  @xcite , e791  @xcite , e687  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , in ref .",
    "@xcite an experimental evidence for a light and broad scalar resonance in the @xmath30 spectrum of the @xmath31 decay was found , which may be identified with the @xmath32 and a peak within the @xmath0 mass range is also observed .",
    "although a considerable amount of data has been accumulated over the years , it has yet not been possible to elucidate the precise @xmath0 quark structure , _",
    "i.e. _ whether one deals with a two - quark or rather a four - quark composite , and thus far there is no consensus on that matter . on the other hand , viewing the @xmath0 exclusively as a @xmath25 or @xmath33 state may simply be too naive @xcite . in this context , an interesting proposition to shed light on the constituent composition of the @xmath0 was recently made by maiani , polosa and riquer  @xcite .",
    "their method consists in comparing the ratio of the decay rates @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this ratio is predicted to be @xmath36 if the @xmath0 is an @xmath37 , @xmath25 state , whereas the composition @xmath38[\\bar s\\bar q ] , q = u , d$ ] , could yield a different value owing to possible interference patterns between @xmath37 and @xmath39 amplitudes in the tetraquark picture of these decays . for a general overview on scalar mesons",
    ", we refer to the particle data group review @xcite and references therein",
    ".    in the case of @xmath40 decays , one may advance plausible reasons to limit oneself to the @xmath25 picture of the @xmath0 . because of the large @xmath11 mass , the outgoing mesons are virtually massless particles , which prompts to expand the corresponding bound states in terms of fock states .",
    "quark configurations like @xmath33 or @xmath41 therefore belong to higher fock states .",
    "a handwaving argument by cheng , chua and yang @xcite suggests that the @xmath25 component of the energetic @xmath0 may be more important , as two rapid @xmath25 pairs are less likely to form a fast moving @xmath0 . in our models we neglect higher fock contributions to the @xmath0 bound state .    in the two - quark model of the light scalar octet below 1  gev , assuming an ideal @xmath19 mixing angle of the octet states , the flavor content of the @xmath0 is purely strange ( @xmath42 ) while that of the @xmath43 or @xmath32 is purely nonstrange ( @xmath44 ) ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "in such a picture the @xmath43 is the lightest scalar , the @xmath0 the heaviest .",
    "however , there is compelling experimental evidence , for instance from @xmath45 decays  @xcite , that the @xmath0 can not be made of strange quarks only .",
    "we therefore introduce in this work some mixing between the strange and nonstrange flavor content .",
    "experimental implications on this mixing have been the object of several studies ( see e.g.  @xcite )    in this paper we complete preliminary calculations of @xmath46 and @xmath47 pseudoscalar to scalar ( @xmath48 ) transition form factors  @xcite .",
    "transition form factors are important for an understanding of the hadronic component of heavy - to - light decay amplitudes and their precise evaluation is crucial to a reliable determination of cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements . the short - distance physics is calculated in perturbative qcd , which comprises radiative vertex corrections to local four - quark operators in the operator product expansion  @xcite as well as hard - scattering corrections with the spectator quark that go beyond the leading order  @xcite . in contrast , the transition form factors are by nature long - distance nonperturbative hadronic matrix elements .",
    "they provide one ingredient of the factorizable amplitudes of the nonleptonic @xmath11 decays mentioned above .",
    "a variety of theoretical approaches to heavy - to - light transition ( pseudoscalar to pseudoscalar ) amplitudes exist , either using light - cone sum rules  @xcite , light - front  @xcite or relativistic quark models  @xcite .",
    "most recently , a comprehensive set of @xmath11 meson heavy - to - light transition form factors , calculated with truncated amplitudes based on dyson - schwinger equations in qcd , was reported in ref .",
    "whereas the methods of refs .",
    "@xcite only provide form factors for a small domain of timelike momentum transfers @xmath13 , those in refs .",
    "@xcite give access to the entire range of physical timelike momenta . to our knowledge",
    ", @xmath48 transition form factors have only been evaluated so far with qcd sum rules  @xcite at @xmath49 four - momentum transfer .",
    "a functional extrapolation is required to access all timelike @xmath13 in these studies .",
    "the present work relies on two explicitly covariant formalisms : the covariant light - front dynamics ( clfd ) and the dispersion relation ( dr ) approaches . both require two size parameters as well as a mixing angle between the @xmath9 and @xmath10 components to specify the @xmath0 wave function .",
    "in order to deduce these parameters from experiment , we fit @xmath1 and @xmath50 branching fractions , where @xmath51 can be a pion or a kaon .",
    "initially , decay amplitudes at tree level in the naive factorization approach are employed and neither annihilation nor penguin topologies are considered . already at tree level ,",
    "nonleptonic two - body @xmath1 decays can be reasonably reproduced within this simple factorization since penguin amplitudes are strongly ckm suppressed .",
    "however , since the charm mass @xmath52 is lighter than the bottom mass by roughly a factor three , nonperturbative contributions of order @xmath53 are more important than in @xmath11 decay amplitudes",
    ". the factorization approach may then be less reliable . in order to study the discrepancy between theoretical and experimental branching fractions",
    ", we study the effect of phenomenological annihilation as well as penguin amplitudes .",

    "it is likely that the gaussian vertex form of the bethe - salpeter amplitudes which describe both the heavy pseudoscalar and the light(er ) scalar bound states are not appropriate at large momentum transfers . in",
    "the @xmath1 decays , the differences are even more pronounced  whereas at the maximum recoil point @xmath49 the dr approach values for @xmath434 are slightly larger in magnitude than those from clfd , they evolve more slowly and at @xmath447 the clfd predictions are considerably larger , as seen in figs .",
    "[ ffbutofou ] and [ ffbstofos ] . in this case , the momentum transfer range @xmath448  gev@xmath436 is lower than the meson mass @xmath449 and the process should be more dominated by soft physics .",
    "therefore , the deviations between dr and clfd can not be ascribed to the behavior of the vertex functions and are intrinsic to the dynamical assumptions in either model .",
    "a feature of the dr model is that the function @xmath450 decreases more rapidly than @xmath451 increases , in particular for the @xmath47 transition form factors .",
    "this steeper slope as well as the factor @xmath452 which is larger than @xmath453 in eq .",
    "( [ eq9.5b ] ) also explain the negative slope of @xmath433 for the @xmath47 transitions .",
    "however , the difference with the clfd form factor prediction is striking and only in the momentum domain of the pion and kaon mass can agreement be found .",
    "the problem of model dependence appears at larger momentum transfer , where various models yield rather different results , whereas at @xmath454 ref .",

    "the form factors are controlled by the function @xmath292 , introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq9.13 ] ) , which forces @xmath433 and @xmath434 to behave as @xmath456 and therefore become very large at the kinematical limit whenever the denominator tends to zero .    it is worthwhile to recall that quark model predictions have a constituent mass dependence causing a systematic error in the computation of the form factors .",
    "this is in particularly true for the light sector where it is known that the dressed - quark mass receives strong momentum - dependent corrections at infrared momenta , an expression of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the enhancement of the mass function in the light - quark propagators is central to the occurrence of a constituent - quark mass scale . on the other hand ,",
    "the impact on heavy - quark propagators of chiral symmetry breaking is much less marked for @xmath241-quarks and even less so for @xmath240-quarks .",
    "it can be shown that that the heavy propagator @xmath457 is justified for @xmath240-quarks and to a certain extent also for @xmath241-quarks @xcite .",
    "thus , in the approach of same propagators for light and heavy quarks , with a light constituent mass of @xmath458  gev , a certain mass dependent uncertainty is implicit .",
    "we also remind that both @xmath1 and @xmath11 mesons are lightly bound and that the bound state condition @xmath459 is only fulfilled in the quark model if the light - quark mass is chosen to be large . however , since we make use of the features of confining models , this constraint does not affect our predictions .",
    "as an example , if we choose for the light - quark mass @xmath460  gev , modifications of the form factors magnitude at larger @xmath13 values are not insignificant . in the dr approach , for instance , a decrease of the light - quark mass , which implies a readjustment of the meson parameters to fit their decay constants , @xmath433 and @xmath434 evolve more rapidly and overall we observe modifications of the order of @xmath461 for @xmath13 up to the squared kaon mass .",
    "changes in the strange quark mass scarcely alter these form factors on the other hand .",
    "this observation is more striking for @xmath47 transitions , where the heavy - light quark mass differences @xmath462 and @xmath463 are smaller than when a @xmath240-quark is involved .",
    "a proper treatment of dressed light - quark propagators should remedy this situation .",
    "we have investigated the role of the scalar meson @xmath0 in quasi - two - body decays of @xmath464 and @xmath57 mesons focussing on the weak transition form factors @xmath465 and @xmath466 , which are of particular interest to flavor physics . in order to obtain a consistent parametrization of the @xmath0 wave function , we first applied a simple factorization ansatz to these @xmath1",
    "decays where the approach is reasonable . here , the quasi - two body @xmath467 branching ratios are deduced from the experimental ones for @xmath468 and the knowledge of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 branching fractions . once the scalar - meson parameters are determined by fitting the matrix element @xmath465 to experimental data",
    ", they are readily available for other flavor changing matrix elements involving the @xmath240-quark although in that case the approach is on less firm grounds . the short - distance physics in the factorization",
    "is known from perturbation theory applied to the operator product expansion and codified in terms of wilson coefficients .",
    "the long - distance effects concern two sets of form factors ; namely the experimentally known decay constants and the heavy - to - light transition form factors .",
    "the latter are nontrivial objects which involve quark as well as hadron degrees of freedom . in our approach",
    ", we have modeled these form factors with triangle diagrams ( at the tree level ) in the impulse approximation .",
    "the mesonic bethe - salpeter amplitudes are described by gaussian two - quark vertex functions which introduce size parameters . in the case of the scalar meson",
    ", we also need a mixing angle between the strange and nonstrange components of its wave function for which we assume the simplest possible quark structure .",
    "that is to say , we neglect higher fock states or possible hadronic dressings which may enrich the @xmath25 state with other components such as @xmath469 , @xmath470 _ etc_. in order to perform an actual calculation . as noted previously in secs .",
    "i and ii , a consequence of the mixing is the presence of a strange component in the @xmath43 or @xmath32 state , strange content which does not seem to be experimentally observed .",
    "a specific discussion of the structure of this broad state is outside the scope of the present study and would require , as we just pointed out , to work beyond the simplest two - quark structure .    in this work ,",
    "we have examined two different but explicitly covariant approaches to establish the model dependance of the form factors . in both model calculations ,",
    "the impulse approximation is used and quark masses as well as dynamical assumptions are the identical , though certain kinematical aspects differ . in particular , in the dr approach internal quarks are put on - mass shell and the amplitudes are expressed as double dispersive integrals of the triangle diagram s discontinuity over initial and final mass variables .",
    "in contrast to the dr approach , in the clfd calculation the integration is performed over the internal loop momenta . moreover , even though the bethe - salpeter amplitudes of the @xmath464 and @xmath0 have identical gaussian forms , the meson vertex normalization is not identical in both models .",
    "these differences may be the origin for certain discrepancies we find in our results . in fitting the set of experimental @xmath467 branching ratios ,",
    "we do obtain similar values for the mixing angle .",
    "overall , the fit quality is comparable and rather good given the large experimental errors .",
    "however , while at small momentum transfer , around the light meson masses @xmath471 and @xmath423 , we find very similar transition form factors , for larger values of @xmath13 where no experimental constraints exist the discrepancy is obvious . in the case of @xmath55 transitions , stronger deviations between both models are observed . for the @xmath54 transitions , the discrepancy is already obvious for @xmath472 as seen , in particular , in the different slopes of @xmath433 obtained in dr and clfd .",
    "this is also a hint that the constituent quark model may be reliable solely for a certain domain of @xmath13 .    clearly , dynamical aspects of qcd , such as running quark masses , are important in the computation of these form factors .",
    "furthermore , the parametrization of the heavy mesons depends on the precise knowledge of the pseudoscalar decay constant .",
    "as confinement is only approximately achieved and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking not realized in either model calculation , some of the uncertainty defies any quantification . when these formalisms are applied to calculations which can be compared to observables such as decay constants , typical deviations from the experimental values",
    "are of the order of @xmath473 . given the large errors in the experimental @xmath474 branching fractions and the still elusive structure of the scalar @xmath0 , assuming a @xmath25 composition , this provides a lower bound of our theoretical error ] which we estimate to be of the order of @xmath475 .",
    "nonetheless , we consider that there is a domain of validity for these models which overlaps with the typical momentum transfers @xmath13 that occur in leptonic as well as nonleptonic weak decays of @xmath464 and @xmath57 mesons .",
    "the present study provides a first calculation of heavy pseudoscalar to scalar meson transition form factors at the exact momentum transfer values @xmath476 and @xmath449 without resorting to any extrapolation .",
    "surely , this work leaves plenty of room for improvement ; obviously a better understanding of the scalar - meson structure is of foremost concern , but a more genuine realization of confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking is also desirable .",
