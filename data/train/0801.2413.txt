    "in simple deterministic dynamical systems physical quantities like transport coefficients can be fractal functions of control parameters .",
    "this finding was first reported for a one - dimensional piecewise linear map lifted periodically onto the whole real line , for which the diffusion coefficient was computed by using markov partitions and topological transition matrices @xcite .",
    "a generalization of this result was obtained for a map with both drift and diffusion by deriving exact analytical solutions for the transport coefficients @xcite .",
    "further maps modeling chemical reaction - diffusion @xcite and anomalous diffusion @xcite yielded also fractal transport coefficients .",
    "recent work aimed at physically more realistic models like ( hamiltonian ) particle billiards , for which computer simulations yielded transport coefficients that are non - monotonic under parameter variation @xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite contains a summary of this line of research .",
    "these results asked for a more detailed characterization of the `` fractality '' of transport coefficients . a first attempt in this direction was reported by klages and klau @xcite , who used standard techniques from the theory of fractal dimensions for characterizing the drift and diffusion coefficients of the map studied in @xcite .",
    "they numerically computed a non - integer box counting dimension for these curves which varied with the parameter interval , leading to the notion of a `` fractal fractal dimension '' .",
    "these results were questioned by koza @xcite , who computed the oscillation of these graphs at specific markov partition parameter values . his work suggested a dimensionality of one by conjecturing that there exist non - trivial logarithmic corrections to the usual power law behaviour in the oscillation .",
    "this research reveals the need to study the parameter dependence of transport coefficients in a rigorous mathematical setting , which can be formulated as follows : given a parametrized family of chaotic dynamical systems @xmath4 on an interval @xmath5 with unique invariant physical measures @xmath6 together with a family of sufficiently regular observables @xmath7 one has , under suitable mixing assumptions on the systems @xmath8 , a law of large numbers and a central limit theorem for the partial sum processes @xmath9 , namely @xmath10 and @xmath11 where @xmath12 . for suitable choices of the observables @xmath13 , the process",
    "@xmath14 is just the deterministic random walk generated by a lift of the map @xmath15 to the real axis , and @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the drift and diffusion coefficient of this random walk respectively .",
    "there are a few rigorous results in the literature describing the dependence of @xmath6 and of quantities like @xmath1 for various classes of systems . without going into the details",
    "they can be summarized as follows : if the maps @xmath15 and the observables @xmath13 depend smoothly on @xmath16 and if the topological conjugacy class of @xmath15 is not changed when @xmath16 is varied , then @xmath6 ( and hence @xmath1 ) depends differentiably on @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "if the topological class changes , quantities like @xmath1 may behave less regular and have a modulus of continuity not better than @xmath17 , even for very simple maps @xmath15 like symmetric tent maps @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "this modulus of continuity is the rule for systems whose perron - frobenius operator ( acting on a suitable space of `` regular '' densities ) has a spectral gap @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to explicitly relate these mathematical results to transport coefficients .",
    "we do so by rigorously proving continuity properties of @xmath1 and @xmath2 under parameter variation for certain classes of deterministic maps . in section  [ sec : general ] we give a general estimate for families of dynamics ( deterministic or not ) , which can be described in terms of perron - frobenius operators with exponential mixing properties .",
    "the applicability of these general results to piecewise @xmath0 expanding interval maps and in particular to the class of piecewise linear maps discussed in @xcite is checked in section  [ sec : checking ] .",
    "the main result is that @xmath2 has a modulus of continuity of order @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath2 is lipschitz continuous up to quadratic logarithmic corrections . in section  [ sec : transport ]",
    "we summarize the general results for transport coefficients in the special case of piecewise linear maps and provide more precise estimates for special parameters .",
    "our analytical findings are verified by numerical computations in section  [ sec : numerical ] , for which we use exact analytical formulas of the transport coefficients @xcite .",
    "particularly , we numerically analyze local variations of these properties .",
    "our work corrects and amends previous results reported in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath5 be a compact interval , @xmath18 normalized lebesgue measure on @xmath5 , @xmath19 the space of lebesgue - integrable functions from @xmath5 to @xmath20 , and @xmath21 the space of @xmath19-equivalence classes of functions of bounded variation .",
    "we use the following simplified notation for the two corresponding norms : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the variation of @xmath24 as a function from @xmath25 ( i.e.extended by @xmath26 on @xmath27 ) . if @xmath24 is differentiable as a function from @xmath25 integration by parts shows easily that @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 is obviously a semi - norm , and as @xmath30 , it is actually a norm .",
    "this and more details on functions of bounded variation can be found in @xcite .",
    "the monograph @xcite is a comprehensive reference for most of the background material needed in this section .",
    "we consider a family @xmath31 of nonsingular maps @xmath32 .",
    "_ nonsingular _ means that the _ perron - frobenius operator _",

    "our main assumption is that the maps in @xmath31 are _ uniformly exponentially mixing _ in the following sense :    [ hypo : mixing ] each @xmath36 has a unique invariant probability density @xmath38 ( so @xmath39 ) , and there are constants @xmath40 and @xmath41 such that , for all @xmath36 , @xmath42    observe the following consequences of hypothesis  [ hypo : norm - bounded ] and  [ hypo : mixing ] : @xmath43 and @xmath44 indeed , @xmath45 as @xmath46 by hypothesis  [ hypo : mixing ] for each probability density @xmath47 , and @xmath48 by hypothesis  [ hypo : norm - bounded ] .",
    "hence follows from the definition of @xmath49 , and then is an immediate consequence .",

    "the following one , which was already considered in @xcite , is most apropriate .",
    "it measures the distance between two maps @xmath50 and @xmath51 from @xmath31 in terms of a suitable norm of @xmath52 : @xmath53 this distance can be controlled in terms of a more `` hands - on '' distance between the graphs of the maps : @xmath54 namely ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 13 ) ) , @xmath55 now , as a warm - up exercise , we can prove the following estimate : for @xmath56 let @xmath57    [ lemmma : density - dependence ] there exist constants @xmath58 such that @xmath59    let @xmath60 , assume without loss of generality that @xmath61 , and fix @xmath62 . for @xmath47 , @xmath63 where we used hypothesis  [ hypo : norm - bounded ] .",

    "examples for this fact within the family of symmetric mixing tent maps are provided in @xcite .",
    "suppose now that to each @xmath36 there is associated an `` observable '' @xmath66 .",
    "we make the following assumptions :    [ hypo : psi - bounded ] @xmath67    [ hypo : psi - dependence ] there is @xmath68 such that @xmath69 for all @xmath70 .    denote @xmath71",
    "then we have immediately from and lemma  [ lemmma : density - dependence ]    [ koro : j ] there is some @xmath72 such that , for all @xmath70 , @xmath73    @xmath74 is the `` drift '' of the partial sum process @xmath75 under the invariant measure @xmath76 , where @xmath77 .",

    "in this subsection we show how the general hypothesis  [ hypo : norm - bounded ] and  [ hypo : mixing ] can be verified in the more particular setting when @xmath31 is a parametrized family of piecewise twice continuously differentiable and expanding interval maps .",
    "so , from now on , we look at the following setting : @xmath122    we start with an abstract result which reduces hypothesis  [ hypo : mixing ] essentially to a uniform lasota - yorke type inequality .",

    "another important problem is to check whether such logarithmic corrections in transport coefficients might also be expected to occur in more ` physical ' systems , which are perhaps even accessible experimentally .",
