    "in recent years , quantum complexity classes have been defined and studied in an attempt to understand the capacity and limitations of quantum computers and quantum algorithms and their relation to classical complexity classes .",
    "the complexity class qma , also known as bqnp , was studied and defined in @xcite and in @xcite as the quantum analogue of the classical complexity class np in a probabilistic setting .",
    "the local - hamiltonian problem , a quantum analogue of classical satisfiability problems such as max - k - sat , is an example of a complete problem for the class qma . initially , building on ideas that go back to feynman @xcite , kitaev @xcite",
    "has shown that 5-local hamiltonian is qma complete .",
    "later , kempe and regev @xcite showed that 3-local hamiltonian is qma complete .",
    "using perturbation theory gadgets , this result was further improved to show that 2-local hamiltonian is qma complete as well @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the basic ingredient in all of these proofs is a reduction between quantum circuits and time independent local hamiltonians .",
    "recently , quantum @xmath2-sat , the special case where the hamiltonian is a sum of local projectors was defined and studied by bravyi @xcite as a natural analogue of classical @xmath2-sat .",
    "there it was shown that quantum 2-sat is in p and that quantum 4-sat is complete for qma@xmath0 ( qma with single sided error ) .",
    "the classification of quantum 3-sat is still an open question .    in this work",
    "we show a new reduction from a verifier quantum circuit to a 3-local hamiltonian .",
    "the novelty of our construction is that it leaves the space of legal clock - register states invariant .",
    "therefore , the weights of the terms in our hamiltonian do not scale with the size of of the input problem .",
    "such terms do appear in the constructions of @xcite and @xcite . as an intermediate step in our construction ,",
    "we prove that quantum 3-sat for qutrits is qma@xmath0-complete .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we review the necessary background in section [ prel ] . in section [ 3sat ]",
    "we present a qutrit - clock construction and show that quantum 3-sat for particles with dimensions @xmath3 ( the interaction terms in the hamiltonian couple one qutrit and two qubits ) is qma@xmath0-complete .",
    "the existence of such a construction was previously mentioned but not specified by bravyi and divincenzo in @xcite as @xcite . in section [ 3loc ] we show how to encode the qutrit clock particles from section [ 3sat ] into a pair of qubits in such a way that the hamiltonian remains 3-local . thus we obtain a new construction of a qma complete 3-local hamiltonian .",
    "this hamiltonian is composed of 4-local positive operator terms .",
    "however , each of these 4-local positive operators is composed of only 3-local interaction terms .",
    "this is not a quantum 3-sat hamiltonian , since the 3-local terms by themselves are not positive operators .",
    "we discuss the complexity of quantum 3-sat and further directions in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "a promise problem @xmath4 of size @xmath5 is in the class qma if there exists a polynomial time quantum verifier circuit @xmath6 such that    1 .",

    ", we will use the notation @xmath16 , meaning that the verifier circuit @xmath17 is the verifier circuit @xmath6 for the specific instance @xmath18 of the problem @xmath19 .",
    "an operator @xmath20 acting on @xmath5 qubits is said to be @xmath2-local if @xmath20 can be expressed as the sum of hermitian operators , each acting on at most @xmath2 qubits . in the local - hamiltonian decision problem , we are given a description of a @xmath2-local hamiltonian on @xmath5 qubits , @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "each @xmath23 has a bounded operator norm @xmath24 and its entries are specified by poly@xmath25 bits . in addition , we are given two constants @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "we have to decide whether the ground state energy of @xmath20 is at most @xmath28 ( `` yes '' instance ) or at least @xmath29 ( `` no '' instance ) .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the @xmath2-local hamiltonian problem for any constant @xmath2 is in qma .",
    "therefore , in order to prove that @xmath2-local hamiltonian is qma complete , we now need to show that given a quantum verifier circuit @xmath17 and constants @xmath30 as in the definition of qma , we can construct a @xmath2-local hamiltonian @xmath20 and find constants @xmath28 and @xmath29 in polynomial time , with the following properties .",
    "if @xmath31 such that the computation @xmath32 yields the answer 1 with probability at least @xmath10 , the groundstate energy of @xmath20 has is at most @xmath28 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath33 , the computation @xmath32 yields the answer 1 with probability at most @xmath12 , the ground state energy of @xmath20 is greater than @xmath29 .",
    "the idea of encoding a unitary computation into the ground state of a time independent hamiltonian goes back to feynman @xcite . to encode the quantum computation @xmath34 with @xmath19 steps on an unknown @xmath5-qubit input @xmath35 ( and @xmath36 ancilla qubits ) into the ground state of a hamiltonian",
    ", we define a hamiltonian acting on the space of @xmath37 work qubits , and on a clock register .",
    "we represent the computational history for the computation @xmath17 by the state @xmath38 , where the states @xmath39 for @xmath40 are @xmath41 orthogonal legal states of the clock register representing time @xmath40 and the state @xmath42 represents the state of the work qubits at time @xmath2 .",
    "the expectation value of this hamiltonian in a quantum state @xmath43 `` checks '' whether the state encodes a valid quantum computation that yielded a `` yes '' answer .",
    "this is achieved by constructing the hamiltonian as a sum of positive terms that penalize ( i.e. , increase the energy of ) states that do not encode a legal computation , and terms that penalize legal computational history states that yielded the `` no '' answer : @xmath44 the term @xmath45 acts only on the clock register and penalizes illegal states of the clock .",
    "this allows us to decompose the hilbert space on which @xmath20 acts as @xmath46 the subspace of legal clock states @xmath47 depends on the specific realization of the clock register .",
    "the other terms in the hamiltonian also depend on the realization of the clock .",
    "however , their restriction to @xmath48 has a simple form .",
    "the term @xmath49 penalizes computations that are not initialized properly at the first clock time .",
    "restricted to the legal clock subspace , it reads : @xmath50 the term @xmath51 penalizes computations that do not output `` yes '' at the final clock time .",
    "its restriction to the legal clock space is : @xmath52 finally , @xmath53 verifies that the state properly encodes the computation .",
    "it penalizes all states for which the components with the clock register in times @xmath2 and @xmath54 , i.e. @xmath55 and @xmath56 , are not related by @xmath57 .",
    "the restriction of @xmath53 to @xmath48 is : @xmath58 the idea is that if @xmath17 is a verifier circuit that outputs `` yes '' on @xmath35 with high probability , then the state @xmath59 which encodes the history of the computation of @xmath17 on @xmath60 , is the ground state of @xmath20 and has a small eigenvalue . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath17 is a verifier circuit that outputs `` no '' with high probability , then any state will have high energy , either because it does not encode a legal computation , or because the legal computation it encodes is not likely to output `` yes '' .",
    "using this idea it was shown by kitaev in @xcite that 5-local hamiltonian is qma complete .",
    "kitaev s construction uses a unary clock on @xmath41 clock qubits with @xmath41 legal clock states @xmath61 .",
    "it is simple to advance this clock by just flipping the @xmath62-th clock qubit .",
    "however , to recognize that the clock is in the state @xmath63 , we need to look at the two clock qubits @xmath64 and verify that they are in the state @xmath65 . to check whether a state properly encodes a computational step @xmath66",
    ", one needs to compare the work qubits at clock states @xmath63 and @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , the terms @xmath68 that verify that a state properly encodes a computation , must couple 5 qubits ; the 3 clock qubits @xmath69 needed to recognize @xmath70 and the two work qubits on which the 2-qubit gate @xmath71 acts .",
    "therefore , this realization is 5-local .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that 3-local hamiltonian is qma complete .",
    "this result was further improved to show that 2-local hamiltonian is qma complete @xcite .",
    "both constructions use the same unary clock realization described above .",
    "since the terms in the hamiltonian are no longer 5-local , the corresponding terms in @xmath72 do not only verify proper application of @xmath71 , but also induce transitions from legal clock states into illegal ones ( the subspace @xmath48 is no longer invariant under the action of @xmath20 ) . to fix this ,",
    "the penalty associated with illegal clock states is made high ( scaling as poly@xmath73 ) , effectively forcing the ground state of the hamiltonian to reside in the subspace of legal clock states .",
    "this increases one of the energy scales of the problem to @xmath74 , because there are @xmath75 terms with weights that scale as @xmath75 .",
    "the new construction we describe in section [ 3loc ] shows that the 3-local hamiltonian problem is qma complete using only terms with constant operator norms , with the norm of our hamiltonian scaling as @xmath76 .",
    "the quantum @xmath2-sat promise problem was introduced by bravyi @xcite as an analogue of classical @xmath2-sat .",
    "the problem is to determine whether the hamiltonian @xmath77 acting on the space of @xmath5 qubits has a zero eigenvalue , or whether all its eigenvalues are higher than @xmath14 . also , @xmath78 where each @xmath79 is a projector acting nontrivially on @xmath2 qubits @xmath80 .",
    "if all the projectors @xmath81 commute , we can transform the states @xmath82 into computational basis states such as @xmath83 and retrieve classical k - sat with @xmath84 .    in @xcite",
    "it was proved that quantum @xmath2-sat belongs to qma@xmath0 for any constant @xmath2 .",
    "it was further shown that quantum 4-sat is qma@xmath0 complete using a new realization of the clock .",
    "bravyi uses @xmath41 clock particles with 4 states : unborn , active 1 ( @xmath85 , input for a gate ) , active 2 ( @xmath86 , output of a gate ) , and dead .",
    "these 4 states of a clock particle are easily realized by two qubits per clock particle .",
    "there are @xmath87 legal clock states : @xmath88 for @xmath89 .",
    "a clock hamiltonian @xmath90 is required to check whether the states of the clock are legal . @xmath91",
    "the hamiltonian checking the correct application of gates is @xmath92 , with @xmath93 each such term verifies the correct application of the gate @xmath71 between the states @xmath94 and @xmath95 of the @xmath2-th clock particle .",
    "this only requires interactions of the @xmath2-th clock particle ( qubit pair ) and the two work qubits the gate @xmath71 is applied to .",
    "each of the terms is thus a 4-local projector .",
    "we need another hamiltonian term to propagate the clock state @xmath96 into @xmath97 while leaving the work qubits untouched ( that is , for the ground state @xmath98 ) .",
    "this is done by the 4-local clock - propagation hamiltonian @xmath99 , with @xmath100 the final ingredients in this construction are @xmath101 applying kitaev s methods @xcite to this construction , bravyi shows that the quantum 4-sat hamiltonian ( a sum of 4-local projectors ) @xmath102 is qma@xmath0 complete .",
    "bravyi s original definition required all of the terms in the hamiltonian to be projectors .",
    "however , using @xmath2-local positive operator terms @xmath103 with zero ground state and constant norm instead of projectors @xmath81 in is an equivalent problem .",
    "quantum @xmath2-sat with positive operators contains quantum @xmath2-sat with projectors . on the other hand ,",
    "if one is able to solve quantum @xmath2-sat with projectors , one can solve quantum @xmath2-sat with positive operators as well .",
    "for each positive operator @xmath103 , we define a projector @xmath104 with the same ground state subspace .",
    "if @xmath105 has a zero ground state , so does @xmath106 .",
    "if the ground state energy of @xmath105 is greater than @xmath107 , the ground state energy of @xmath108 is greater than @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is a constant .",
    "we are thus allowed to use positive operator terms in our hamiltonians instead of just restricting ourselves to projectors .",
    "in this section we present a new realization of the clock which builds on bravyi s quantum 4-sat realization described above . using this clock construction , we prove that quantum 3-sat for qutrits is qma@xmath0-complete .",
    "first , we need to show that quantum 3-sat with qutrits is in qma . we can use bravyi s proof that quantum @xmath2-sat for qubits is in qma@xmath0 for any constant @xmath2 .",
    "given an instance of quantum 3-sat for qutrits , we convert it into an instance of quantum 6-sat for qubits by encoding each qutrit in two qubits and projecting out one of the four states . according to bravyi ,",
    "this problem is in qma@xmath0 and therefore so is the original quantum 3-sat problem with qutrits .    for the other direction in the proof ,",
    "we need to construct a quantum 3-sat hamiltonian for qutrits , corresponding to a given quantum verifier circuit @xmath17 for a problem in qma .",
    "the terms in the hamiltonian we will construct act on the space of one qutrit and two qubits ( particles with dimensions @xmath1 ) .",
    "the clock - register construction in the previous section required 4 states for each clock particle : @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "let us first understand why bravyi s construction requires two `` inactive '' states : @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "if we only use @xmath112 ( i.e. , have legal clock states of the form @xmath114 and @xmath115 ) , we immediately get a 3-local hamiltonian for qutrits .",
    "however , in bravyi s construction , the first clock particle is never in the state @xmath113 , and the last one is never in the state @xmath112 ( see ) .",
    "this ensures that at least one clock particle is in an active state .",
    "when not using the state @xmath113 , we can no longer exclude the state with no active particles @xmath116 in a simple local fashion .",
    "qubits and @xmath19 qutrits .",
    "[ construct3d],width=336 ]    we fix this by modifying the clock register as shown in in fig.[construct3d ] .",
    "the clock register now consists of @xmath87 qubits and @xmath19 qutrits .",
    "the @xmath87 qubits @xmath117 play the role of the usual unary @xmath118 clock representation , while the @xmath19 qutrits @xmath119 play the role of braviy s clock with just three states ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "we define the legal clock space @xmath47 as the space spanned by the @xmath121 states @xmath122 .",
    "these states are defined for @xmath89 as follows : @xmath123 the first state ( @xmath124 ) corresponds to the time when the qubits are `` in transport '' from the the previous gate to the to the current ( @xmath2th ) gate .",
    "the second one corresponds to the time right before application of gate @xmath71 and the third corresponds to the time right after the gate @xmath71 was applied .",
    "the structure of such clock register can be understood as two coupled `` unary '' clocks , the qubit one ( @xmath125 ) of the @xmath126 type and the qutrit one ( the @xmath127 s ) of the @xmath128 type .",
    "formally , the legal clock states satisfy the following constraints :    1 .",
    "if @xmath129 is 1 , then @xmath130 is 1 . 2 .",
    "if @xmath131 is 1 , then @xmath129 is 1 .",
    "if @xmath127 is active ( @xmath132 ) , then @xmath129 is 1 .",
    "if @xmath127 is active ( @xmath132 ) , then @xmath131 is 0 .",
    "5 .   if @xmath129 is 1 and @xmath131 is 0 , then @xmath133 is not dead @xmath134 .",
    "@xmath135 is 1 .",
    "if @xmath136 is 1 , then @xmath137 is not dead .",
    "the last two conditions are required to exclude the clock states @xmath138 and @xmath139 that have no active clock terms .",
    "the clock hamiltonian @xmath140 verifies the above constraints .",
    "@xmath141 only the last term in @xmath142 is a 3-local projector , acting on the space of two qubits and one qutrit .",
    "the rest of the terms are 2-local projectors on two qubits , or a qubit and a qutrit .",
    "the space of legal clock states @xmath47 is the kernel of the clock hamiltonian @xmath45 .",
    "the gate - checking hamiltonian @xmath92 is an analogue of , with @xmath143    , width=345 ]    the clock propagation proceeds in two steps .",
    "first , the `` active '' spot in the clock register moves from the state @xmath95 of the qutrit @xmath127 to the @xmath65 state of the next two qubits @xmath144 .",
    "after this , it moves into the state @xmath94 of the next qutrit @xmath145 , as in fig.[clockprop3d ] .",
    "the hamiltonian checking whether this happened , while the work qubits were left untouched , is @xmath146 , with @xmath147 the input hamiltonian checks whether the computation has properly initialized ancilla qubits .",
    "@xmath148 finally , the output hamiltonian checks whether the result of the computation was 1 .",
    "@xmath149    all of the terms coming from  in the hamiltonian @xmath150 are projectors",
    ". therefore , the ground state has energy zero if and only if there exists a zero energy eigenstate of all of the terms .",
    "if there exists a witness @xmath35 on which the computation @xmath17 gives the result 1 with probability 1 , we can construct a computational history state for a modified circuit @xmath151 , where the `` identity '' gates correspond to the clock propagation in our construction , with nothing happening to the work qubits .",
    "this state is a zero eigenvector of all of the terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "we now need to prove that if no witness exists ( the answer to the problem is `` no '' ) , then the ground state energy of is @xmath152 .",
    "let us decompose the hilbert space into @xmath153 where @xmath47 is the space of legal clock states ( on which @xmath154 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian leaves this decomposition invariant , because it does not induce transitions between legal and illegal clock states .",
    "since any state in @xmath155 violates at least one term in @xmath45 , the lowest eigenvalue of the restriction of to @xmath156 is at least 1 . on the other hand ,",
    "the restriction of @xmath20 to the legal clock space is identical to the legal clock space restriction of bravyi s hamiltonian from the previous section .",
    "therefore , his proof using the methods of kitaev @xcite applies to our case as well .",
    "he shows that if a no witness state for the quantum circuit @xmath17 exists , then the ground state energy of the restriction of to @xmath48 is @xmath152 .",
    "this means that if there is no witness state for the verifier circuit @xmath17 , the ground state of is @xmath152 .",
    "this concludes the proof that quantum 3-sat with qutrits ( in fact , quantum 3-sat on particles with dimensions @xmath1 , a qutrit and two qubits ) is qma@xmath0 complete .",
    "the existence of another @xmath3 construction for quantum 3-sat ( i.e. , a hamiltonian with terms acting on one qutrit and two qubits ) was already mentioned in @xcite as @xcite , though that construction was not specified .",
    "we think it is instructive to write our result explicitly since it serves as a natural intermediate step towards the new 3-local hamiltonian construction described in the following section .",
    "in bravyi s quantum 4-sat construction @xcite , the clock particles ( qubit pairs ) can be in 4 states . in the previous section",
    ", we required only 3 states of the clock particles and used qutrits as particles with these three states .",
    "we start with the clock - register construction ( see fig.[construct3d ] ) from the previous section , with legal states as in .",
    "however , we now encode the three states of every clock qutrit @xmath127 using a pair of qubits @xmath157 .",
    "the new clock register is depicted in fig.[construct3loc ] .",
    "@xmath158 this encoding allows us to construct a new 3-local hamiltonian construction .",
    "this hamiltonian is be a quantum 4-sat hamiltonian whose 4-local positive operator terms consist of just 3-local interactions .",
    "we are looking for 3-local terms that flip between the clock states @xmath159 , while simultaneously ( un)applying a 2-qubit gate @xmath71 on two work qubits . we encode the active states of a clock particle into entangled states , and thus we are able to flip between these clock states with a term like @xmath160 , involving only one of the clock particles .",
    "thus our 2-qubit gate checking hamiltonian involves only 3-local terms ( acting on one clock qubit @xmath161 or @xmath162 and the two work qubits on which the gate @xmath71 acts ) .     qubits .",

    "the second one corresponds to the time right before application of gate @xmath71 and the third corresponds to the time right after the gate @xmath71 was applied .",

    "for the second step , the desired zero energy eigenvectors are @xmath210 and the state we want to exclude is @xmath211 the hamiltonian with these properties is a simple analogue of : @xmath212 this is again a positive operator with eigenvalues 0 ( @xmath199 ) , 1 ( @xmath200 ) , 2 ( @xmath201 ) and 3 ( @xmath202 ) .",
    "its zero energy eigenvectors are @xmath213 , @xmath214 , @xmath215 , @xmath216 expressed above , and three illegal clock states , @xmath217 , @xmath218 and @xmath219 , which are penalized by @xmath45 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the only purpose of this hamiltonian term is to have a positive expectation value for the legal state of the clock register @xmath220 , which does not correctly propagate the clock .",
    "just as in the previous section , the total hamiltonian leaves the decomposition into @xmath221 invariant while all illegal clock states violate at least one term in @xmath45 .",
    "again , up to a constant prefactor , the restriction of @xmath20 to the legal clock space is the same as that of the hamiltonian in .",
    "the proof of the necessary separation between positive and negative instances then follows the proof in the previous section .",
    "this concludes the proof that quantum 4-sat with positive operators made out of 3-local terms is qma@xmath0 complete .",
    "in this work we proved that quantum 3-sat for particles with dimensions @xmath222 is qma@xmath0 complete . we have shown in section [ qkssection ] that quantum @xmath2-sat with positive operator terms ( not just projectors ) is equivalent to quantum @xmath2-sat with projector terms .",
    "we presented a new 3-local construction of a quantum 4-sat hamiltonian with positive operator terms , proving that quantum 4-sat with 3-local interactions is qma@xmath0 complete .",
    "the difference between the @xmath2-local - hamiltonian problem and the quantum @xmath2-sat problem is that for a `` yes ''",
    "instance of the latter , a common ground state of _ all _ of the terms in the hamiltonian must exist .",
    "the @xmath2-local - hamiltonian problem is a quantum analogue to classical max-@xmath2-sat , where we are interested only in the properties of the ground state of the _ total _ hamiltonian ( the _ sum _ of the terms ) .",
    "it seems natural to define quantum max-@xmath2-sat as the @xmath2-local - hamiltonian problem restricted to positive operator terms .",
    "quantum max-@xmath2-sat is equivalent to the @xmath2-local - hamiltonian problem .",
    "obviously , @xmath2-local - hamiltonian contains quantum max-@xmath2-sat . on the other hand",
    ", there is a straightforward reduction from @xmath2-local - hamiltonian to quantum max-@xmath2-sat ; we shift the eigenvalues of each local operator @xmath223 in @xmath2-local - hamiltonian to make it a positive operator , @xmath224 , appropriate for quantum max-@xmath2-sat .",
    "the corresponding energy parameters are @xmath225 and @xmath226 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are parameters defined in sec.[lochamsection ] .",
    ".known complexity for classical and quantum sat - type problems .",
    "[ cols=\">,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the currently known complexities of classical and quantum satisfiability problems are shown in table [ comparetable ] .",
    "quantum 3-sat contains classical 3-sat and therefore is np - hard . unlike classical @xmath2-sat , which is known to be np - complete for @xmath227 , quantum @xmath2-sat",
    "is only known to be qma@xmath0 complete for @xmath228 @xcite . in our opinion , it is unlikely that one can show that quantum 3-sat ( @xmath229 ) is also complete for qma@xmath0 .",
    "one indication for this arises in our numerical explorations , where random instances of quantum 3-sat for a reasonable number of clauses generally have no solutions , unless the clauses exclude non - entangled states .",
    "this may suggest that the hardness of quantum 3-sat actually lies only in the classical instances ( 3-sat ) and a classical verifier circuit for quantum 3-sat might exist .",
    "another reason comes from dimension counting .",
    "this argument , however , is only valid for the specific encoding of a circuit into the hamiltonian we used .",
    "we worked with a tensor product space @xmath230 , encoding the computation in the history state .",
    "encoding an interaction of two qubits requires at least an @xmath231 dimensional space ( @xmath232 for the two qubits before the interaction and @xmath232 for the qubits after the interaction ) . on a first glance , a three - local projector on the space of two work qubits and one clock qubit ( @xmath233 ) seems to suffice",
    "however , we must ensure that this interaction only occurs at a specific clock time .",
    "when the two work qubits interact with just a single clock qubit ( flipping it between states before / after interaction ) ambiguities and legal - illegal clock state transitions are unavoidable .",
    "this transforms the problem from the sat - type ( determining whether a _ simultaneous _ ground state of _ all _ terms in the hamiltonian exists ) to the max - sat type problem ( determining the properties of the ground state energy of the _ sum of terms _ in the hamiltonian ) .",
    "a single clock qubit can not both determine the exact time of an interaction and distinguish between the states before and after the interaction .",
    "we managed to overcome this obstacle by using three - dimensional clock particles with states @xmath234 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 and a @xmath235 dimensional space for encoding the interactions .",
    "we believe that this can not be further improved with more clever clock - register realizations within the @xmath236 framework .",
    "a different approach to encoding a quantum computation into the ground state of a hamiltonian is found in the work of aharonov et.al @xcite .",
    "their _ geometric clock _",
    "idea is to lay out the qubits in space in such a way , that the `` shape '' of the state ( the shape of qubits which are currently in active states ) uniquely corresponds to a clock time .",
    "their motivation was to show that adiabatic quantum computation @xcite is polynomially equivalent to the circuit model .",
    "as a side result , they showed that the nearest - neighbor 2-local hamiltonian problem with 6-dimensional particles is qma complete .",
    "we actually know , as kempe et al .",
    "proved , that even 2-local hamiltonian with 2-dimensional particles ( qubits ) is qma complete @xcite .",
    "we did not succeed to improve or reproduce the construction of quantum 3-sat for particles with dimensions @xmath237 using the geometric clock framework .",
    "however , one can use the idea of a geometric clock to construct quantum 2-sat for higher dimensional particles ( qudits ) .",
    "we know that classical 2-sat for particles with dimensions @xmath238 contains graph coloring , and is thus np - complete . using a rather straightforward modification of the aharonov et .",
    "construction , one can prove that quantum 2-sat for 12-dimensional particles is qma complete . combining the work / clock and the geometric clock constructions ,",
    "a much tighter result can be shown .",
    "specifically , one can construct quantum 2-sat for particles with dimensions @xmath239 and prove that it is qma@xmath0 complete @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to find out whether these are the minimal dimensions of particles for which quantum 2-sat is qma@xmath0 complete .",
