    "one of the most favoured possible extensions of the standard model ( sm ) is supersymmetry ( susy ) , which renders natural the electroweak mass scale @xcite and accommodates grand unification of the particle interactions @xcite .",
    "if @xmath6  parity is conserved it also provides a promising candidate for astrophysical cold dark matter , which might be the lightest neutralino , @xmath7 @xcite , or the gravitino @xcite .",
    "susy also predicts the appearance of a relatively light higgs boson @xcite , and may provide a welcome correction to the sm prediction for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "however , even the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm , the mssm @xcite , boasts over 100 free parameters , mostly associated with the mechanism of soft susy - breaking .",
    "hence simplified scenarios with particular restrictions on the pattern of susy - breaking are often studied .",
    "one example is the constrained mssm ( cmssm ) @xcite , in which the soft susy - breaking gaugino masses @xmath4 , scalar masses @xmath5 and trilinear couplings @xmath9 are each assumed to be universal at the grand unification ( gut ) scale , and @xmath10 is unconstrained .",
    "this leads to four effectively - free parameters , if the gravitino is assumed to be sufficiently heavy and/or rare that its cosmological decays and its mass are irrelevant .",
    "another possibility is to relax the universality constraint for common soft susy - breaking contributions to the higgs masses , yielding the nuhm1 @xcite with five effective parameters in addition to the gravitino mass that is assumed to be irrelevant .",
    "alternatively , additional assumptions may be imposed , as in minimal supergravity ( msugra )  @xcite , in which there is a specific relation between the trilinear and bilinear soft susy - breaking parameters and the universal scalar mass : @xmath0 , and the gravitino mass is set equal to the common scalar mass before renormalization : @xmath1  .",
    "hence msugra has just 3 free parameters , namely @xmath11 and @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is now fixed by the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking conditions @xcite .",
    "further , there is a restriction on @xmath5 if the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is the lightest neutralino , @xmath7 , as we assume here for the reasons discussed below .",
    "an intermediate scenario is the very constrained mssm ( vcmssm ) , in which again @xmath0 but the gravitino mass is left free , so there is no restriction on @xmath5 @xcite . if @xmath12 is sufficiently large , and/or the gravitino abundance is sufficiently low ( as we will assume here ) , there are no related cosmological constraints , and the vcmssm also has effectively 3 relevant free parameters , but they are less constrained than in msugra .",
    "we have previously published frequentist analyses of the cmssm and nuhm1 parameter spaces @xcite , implementing the experimental constraints from low - energy electroweak precision data and the lightest higgs boson mass @xmath2 as well as the lower limits from the direct searches for susy particles at lep , fitting the measured value of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath8 , @xmath3  physics and the cosmological dark matter density , @xmath13 , assuming that the lsp is the lightest neutralino , @xmath7 . in this paper",
    "we extend these analyses to include the vcmssm and msugra which have , as discussed above , one or two additional constraints on the pattern of soft susy - breaking , respectively . an early @xmath14 analysis in these scenarios",
    "can be found in  @xcite .    in the case of the vcmssm , in which @xmath0 but the gravitino mass is free",
    ", we assume that the gravitino is sufficiently heavy or rare that the dark matter is composed of neutralinos and the cosmological effects of its decays are unimportant . under these assumptions ,",
    "as we show below , imposing the neutralino dark matter constraint does not increase substantially the @xmath14 of the global minimum , which is @xmath15 higher than in the cmssm , but we find 68 and 95% confidence - level ( cl ) ranges of @xmath4 and @xmath5 that are more restrictive than those found previously in our analyses of the cmssm and the nuhm1 .",
    "however , the preferred part of the vcmssm parameter space has @xmath16 , which within msugra would imply that @xmath17 , so that the lightest neutralino would be unstable , and the dark matter would be composed of gravitinos . in such a case",
    ", the usual calculation of the neutralino dark matter density @xmath13  would be inapplicable , and one should , instead , consider the constraints on the decays of long - lived neutralinos or other sparticles into gravitinos that are imposed by the cosmological abundances of light elements @xcite .",
    "in fact , these constraints are sufficiently strong to exclude , within msugra and assuming a standard cosmological evolution , the otherwise preferred regions of parameter space with @xmath18 and hence gravitino dark matter @xcite  .",
    "thus , the surviving region of the msugra parameter space has @xmath19 , corresponding to neutralino dark matter .",
    "we find within the msugra model two distinct regions with local minima of the @xmath14 function , each of which is significantly worse than in the vcmssm , namely @xmath20 or @xmath21 with 19 dof , corresponding to a goodness  of  fit of just 6.0% ( or 2.3% ) in the msugra hypothesis .",
    "this may be contrasted with the cases of the cmssm and the nuhm1 studied in @xcite , where the best - fit parameters are consistent with the current experimental constraints at the level of 32% ( 31% ) fit probability , and with the vcmssm case ( 20 dof , 31% fit probability ) .",
    "one of the regions preferred in msugra has larger values of both @xmath4 and @xmath5 than in the vcmssm , cmssm and nuhm1 , and the other has larger @xmath5 but small @xmath4 .",
    "before describing our analyses of the vcmssm and msugra in more detail , we first specify our notations , since different conventions for the mssm superpotential couplings and the trilinear and bilinear soft susy - breaking terms are used elsewhere in the literature , including in  @xcite .",
    "our conventions here follow those specified , e.g. , in  @xcite , according to which the superpotential includes the terms @xmath22 where the @xmath23 are yukawa couplings , @xmath24 is the antisymmetric @xmath25 tensor with @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are superfields , and @xmath29 is the higgs supermultiplet mixing parameter .",
    "the corresponding trilinear and bilinear susy - breaking terms in the effective lagrangian are : @xmath30 where the lower - case letters denote the scalar components of the corresponding superfields . within this convention , @xmath31 at the tree level , where @xmath32 is the soft susy - breaking mass of @xmath33 , the left - right mixing term in the stop mixing matrix is @xmath34 , and the one - loop renormalization of the trilinear coefficient has the form @xmath35 ( where @xmath36 denotes the soft susy - breaking parameter in the gluino sector , and @xmath37 is the trilinear higgs - stop coupling . )",
    "these choices unambiguously determine the sign conventions for @xmath38 and @xmath3 .    within this convention , @xmath0 before renormalization in msugra with its minimal ( flat ) khler potential   parameters .",
    "in the notation of these codes , the msugra boundary condition would be @xmath39 . ] .",
    "additionally , as already mentioned , the choice of a minimal khler potential also imposes the condition @xmath40 on the gravitino mass before renormalization , so that msugra has just three independent parameters .",
    "our analysis has been performed using the mastercode  @xcite .",
    "we sample the vcmssm and msugra parameter spaces using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) technique similar to that used in our previous analyses of the cmssm and nuhm1  @xcite .",
    "we evaluate the global likelihood using a @xmath14 function constructed by combining the likelihoods for the experimental constraints from electroweak precision data , the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath8 , @xmath3 physics , the astrophysical cold dark matter density , @xmath13 , and searches for the lightest higgs boson and supersymmetric particles , in exactly the same way as described previously  @xcite . the most significant change in our numerical treatments of these observables",
    "since  @xcite is in @xmath8 , for which we use use the estimate @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "the numerical evaluation within the mastercode combines the following theoretical codes . for the rge running of the soft susy - breaking parameters , it uses softsusy  @xcite , which is combined consistently with the codes used for the low - energy observables : feynhiggs  @xcite",
    "is used for the evaluation of the higgs masses and @xmath42 ( see also @xcite ) . for flavour - related observables",
    "we use sufla  @xcite and superiso  @xcite , and for the electroweak precision data we have included a code based on  @xcite .",

    "[ fig:1dlikelihoods ] ( calculated assuming a @xmath132-n scattering @xmath133 term @xmath134 : see , e.g. , @xcite for a discussion of the implications of modifying this assumption ) we see that a range between @xmath135 and @xmath136  @xmath137 is favoured in the vcmssm , whereas in msugra a range between @xmath138  @xmath137 and @xmath139  @xmath137 is favoured .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : redband ] we display the one - dimensional @xmath14 likelihood functions for @xmath2 in the vcmssm ( left ) and msugra ( right ) , _ not _ including the direct limits from lep and the tevatron  . for each model",
    "we display the likelihood functions , including the theoretical uncertainties ( red bands ) , which we take to be @xmath140 in all models . for comparison",
    ", we also show the mass range excluded for a sm - like higgs boson ( yellow shading ) obtained at lep  @xcite .",
    "this limit is valid since the vcmssm and msugra are sub - spaces of the more general cmssm parameter space , where the lep limits have been shown to be valid  @xcite .",
    "values somewhat below the lep exclusion are favoured in the coannihilation region of msugra , in the vcmssm and the cmssm , entailing @xmath14 prices of 3.9 ( 1.1 ) ( 1.4 ) , as discussed previously . in the msugra coannihilation case ,",
    "the global minimum of @xmath14 found when the lep constraint is disregarded is in an isolated region at low @xmath101 . when the lep higgs constraint is applied , this region is strongly disfavoured , and the global minimum moves to the green star shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m0m12 ] , located at much larger @xmath44 and with @xmath141 .",
    "this other minimum is reflected in the blue point at @xmath142 with @xmath141 and the corresponding horizontal red line visible at the top of the right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : redband ] .",
    "comparably large values of @xmath143 , @xmath144 are favoured in the funnel region of msugra and in the nuhm1 , so these models are naturally consistent with the lep bound on a sm - like higgs boson .",
    "we have completed in this paper the frequentist analysis of a nested sequence of variants of the mssm : nuhm1 @xmath145 cmssm @xmath145 vcmssm @xmath145 msugra , discussing in each case the best - fit point , the minimum @xmath14/dof , the 68 and 95% cl regions and aspects of the favoured ranges of particle masses and other observables .",
    "we found previously that the restriction from the nuhm1 to the cmssm does not change drastically the position of the best - fit point or the favoured ranges of parameters and observables .",
    "this reflects the fact that the present data do not constrain significantly the heavier higgs bosons of the mssm , and so there is no significant tension in the cmssm fit arising from that sector .",
    "likewise , we found in the present paper that the restriction from the cmssm to the vcmssm does not have a large impact on the position of the best - fit point or on the favoured ranges .",
    "this reflects the fact that the present data also do not constrain significantly the trilinear soft susy - breaking parameter @xmath9 , and so there is no significant @xmath14 price to be paid when setting @xmath0 as in the vcmssm .",
    "fits in all three of the nuhm1 , cmssm and vcmssm frameworks have good absolute probabilities in our frequentist analyses .",
    "on the other hand , in msugra two almost equally good best - fit points coexist , with rather different mssm parameter values , significantly higher values of @xmath14 and lower absolute probability , somewhat disfavouring this scenario .",
    "this reflects the fact that the neutralino lsp constraint @xmath146 excludes the best fit found in the vcmssm and forces instead either rather larger values of @xmath57 and @xmath10 or points along the narrow light higgs rapid - annihilation funnel with small @xmath4 but large @xmath5 .    in each of the nuhm1 , cmssm and vcmssm",
    "there is a significant chance of observing first hints of susy in the 2011/12 run of the lhc , whereas this may be more problematic in msugra , depending on whether its parameters lie in the rapid - annihilation funnel or in the higher - mass coannihilation region .",
    "correspondingly , early hints of susy at the lhc in this first run might further favour the nuhm1 , cmssm and vcmssm frameworks over the higher - mass msugra option in the coannihilation region . in the rapid - annihilation funnel region of msugra",
    "one would expect abundant production of gluinos , whereas the first appearances of squarks , having masses in excess of @xmath147 , would only happen at a somewhat later stage . if no sign of susy particles shows up in the early lhc run , in particular if the integrated luminosity ( and energy ) goes significantly beyond the currently foreseen 1/fb at @xmath148 , the scenarios predicting a relatively low susy scale could soon come under pressure . at the time of writing , the atlas and cms collaborations are each examining some 35/pb of analysable data .      since the submission of this paper , the first results of searches for supersymmetry have been published by the cms and atlas collaborations  @xcite .",
    "these change somewhat the parameters of the best - fit points and the 68% and 95% cl regions in the models studied here , but do not disfavour any of them strongly  @xcite .",

    "<S> we make a frequentist analysis of the parameter space of minimal supergravity ( msugra ) , in which , as well as the gaugino and scalar soft supersymmetry - breaking parameters being universal , there is a specific relation between the trilinear , bilinear and scalar supersymmetry - breaking parameters , @xmath0 , and the gravitino mass is fixed by @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider a more general model , in which the gravitino mass constraint is relaxed ( the vcmssm ) . </S>",
    "<S> we combine in the global likelihood function the experimental constraints from low - energy electroweak precision data , the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , the lightest higgs boson mass  @xmath2 , @xmath3  physics and the astrophysical cold dark matter density , assuming that the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is a neutralino . in the vcmssm </S>",
    "<S> , we find a preference for values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 similar to those found previously in frequentist analyses of the constrained mssm ( cmssm ) and a model with common non - universal higgs masses ( nuhm1 ) . on the other hand , in msugra we find two preferred regions : one with larger values of both @xmath4 and @xmath5 than in the vcmssm , and one with large @xmath5 but small @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the probabilities of the frequentist fits in msugra , the vcmssm , the cmssm and the nuhm1 : the probability that msugra is consistent with the present data is significantly less than in the other models . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the msugra and vcmssm predictions for sparticle masses and other observables , identifying potential signatures at the lhc and elsewhere .    </S>",
