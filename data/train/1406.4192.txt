    "the network was sheared in the @xmath111 plane with a constant shear rate @xmath99 up to a final strain @xmath112 , and the shear stress @xmath113 was recorded .",
    "the tests were performed using sllod equations of motion  @xcite implemented in lammps  @xcite , and the temperature was controlled by means of a chain of nos - hoover thermostats .",
    "we show results obtained by averaging over a set of @xmath114 independent initial configurations of the network .",
    "the stress - strain curves corresponding to a set of shear rates spanning more than two orders of magnitude  from @xmath107 to @xmath100  are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : shear ] .",
    "although for large deformations the response of the network depends markedly on the shear rate , there exists a linear elastic regime extending approximately up to @xmath115 from which we can extract a small , but finite shear modulus @xmath116 for @xmath117 ( blue circles in the figure inset ) .",
    "hence our gel network has a solid - like elastic response at relatively low shear rate . in a typical colloidal system characterized by @xmath118 ,",
    "@xmath119 nm , this corresponds to a shear modulus @xmath120 pa , which is consistent with what measured in experiments on dilute colloidal gel networks @xcite . for even lower shear rates the modulus drops towards zero , presumably due to thermally activated restructuring of the network .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the comparison with a non - restructuring network , whose shear modulus is approximately constant over the whole range of shear rates investigated ( green triangles in the figure inset ) .",
    "the iso - configurational analysis was originally introduced for dense glassy alloys  @xcite and needs to be modified for low - density materials . in our low density gel network",
    "the amplitude of particle vibrations at fixed inter - particle bonds is far bigger than the amplitude of cage rattling in a typical dense system . in order to study network relaxation",
    "one needs a way to filter out these vibrations from the underlying displacements due to restructuring . as described in the main text , we have accomplished this task by associating to any given network configuration an _ intrinsic _ configuration , that we compute by constraining the inter - particle bonds and evaluating the average position of each particle during a simulation at constant temperature . since bond - breaking can not take place , the time evolution samples the vibrational dynamics of the given configuration . we compute the intrinsic positions by averaging over a time window @xmath121 in reduced units , which is sufficiently long for most structural correlations to decay to zero in the unconstrained system .    as a demonstration that this approach is able to filter out most of the displacements that are not due to network restructuring , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : pi_cnstr ] the result of the iso - configurational analysis performed on a _ non - restructuring _ network .",
    "the network configuration is the same as the one shown in figs .",
    "3 and 4 of the main text , and the time lag for the isoconfigurational trajectories is likewise @xmath48 .",
    "ideally , one would expect each particle to display zero propensity for displacement . in practice ,",
    "a subset of the particles show a small but non - zero propensity : this is due to very slow network rearrangements that do not entail breaking of existing bonds or formation of new bonds , but still affect the average position of some of the particles .",
    "for instance , a chain initially confined to a region of space by the surrounding chains can break free of its cage and start to oscillate in a different region : this would affect the average position of the particles in the chain , even though no restructuring  that is no change of inter - particle bonds  has taken place .",
    "the contribution of processes of this latter kind to the propensity , however , are very small compared to the displacements due to restructuring . by comparing the propensity for displacement in the restructuring network , @xmath95 , to the same quantity evaluated in the constrained network , @xmath122",
    ", one can define a noise - to - signal ratio as @xmath123 for the configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pi_cnstr ] the @xmath124 , i.e. the displacements not directly ascribable to network restructuring contribute on average less than @xmath125 of the total per - particle signal .      in performing the iso - configurational analysis we have considered six independent configurations of a network with @xmath20 particles ; for each configuration , an ensemble of 100 trajectories has been generated .",
    "this allowed us to associate to each particle @xmath4 a local density of nodes @xmath36  a topological attribute of the particle in the initial configuration  as well as the propensities for non - vibrational displacement ( @xmath95 ) and bond breaking ( @xmath94 ) , which are dynamical properties calculated by averaging over the ensemble of trajectories .",
    "in this way we gathered a set of 24000 triplets @xmath126 .",
    "the raw scatter plots @xmath36 vs. @xmath95 and @xmath36 vs. @xmath94 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : pi_sp ] and  [ fig : bi_sp ] , respectively .",
    "it is apparent that particles characterized by a high propensity for displacement tend to be in regions with low density of nodes ; in contrast , particles characterized by a high propensity for bond breaking tend to localize in regions with high density of nodes .",
    "what is also apparent is that the inverse relationship does not hold , i.e. particles with low ( high ) @xmath36 often do not have high @xmath95 ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "this indicates that the local particle environment is not the only structural property that affects where relaxation takes place .",
    "bond breaking happens preferentially in regions with a high density of nodes ( i.e. crosslinks ) . in order to ascertain whether this is due to a concentration of stresses in those regions ,",
    "we have calculated the stress distribution in the gel .",
    "local stresses are obtained by dividing the simulation box into a set of @xmath127 cubic cells , @xmath128 , and associating with each cell an average stress tensor @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the instantaneous stress tensor corresponding to a specific particle configuration , and the angular brackets denote a time average .",
    "the instantaneous stress tensor for each cell is computed according to the standard virial formula  @xcite in the following way : @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the cell volume , the sum runs over the particles contained in the cell , and @xmath133 represents the contribution to the stress tensor of the interactions involving particle @xmath4 .",
    "the latter is defined by splitting the contribution of each interaction evenly among the particles that participate in it : @xmath134 in the previous expression the first sum runs over the @xmath135 pair interactions that particle @xmath4 is part of , @xmath136 and @xmath137 are the positions of the two interacting particles , and @xmath138 and @xmath139 are the forces on the two particles resulting from the interaction . along the same lines the second sum takes into account the @xmath140 three - body interactions involving particle @xmath4 .",
    "is readily available in ` lammps ` thanks to the fix ` stress / atom ` . ]",
    "we have applied the analysis just outlined to a gel network with @xmath141 particles , density @xmath22 and interaction strength @xmath44 ( reduced temperature @xmath110 ) .",
    "the simulation box has been divided in @xmath142 cells , so that each cell contains on average around @xmath143 particles .",
    "the time window for the temporal averaging has been chosen as @xmath144 , which is long enough to account for the vibrational dynamics of the network , but yet short enough for the network structure not to be significantly perturbed by the restructuring process ( during the prescribed time window less than 5% of the particles change neighbors ) .",
    "for each cell we have also computed the average number density of nodes @xmath145 , a quantity that measures the local concentration of crosslinks .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : st_vs_rhonodes ] we show the scatter plot of the components of the local stress tensor vs. the local density of nodes .",
    "the shear components @xmath146 , @xmath111 and @xmath147 are on average zero and do not show any particular correlation with the density of nodes . on the contrary , the diagonal components @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 are greater than zero and have a positive correlation with the density of nodes .",
    "this means that the cells are under isotropic tension , the tension being greater where the density of nodes is higher .",
    "the same trend is evinced from fig .",
    "[ fig : stnorm_vs_rhonodes ] , where the norm of the local stress tensor is plotted vs. the local density of nodes .",
    "the positive correlation between the two quantities is assessed by a pearson s coefficient @xmath151 .            in order to understand which parts of the gel are more prone to displacement as a consequence of internal stresses",
    "we have performed a quasi - equilibrium deformation of the network at zero temperature and looked at the non - affine displacement field .",
    "the procedure is as follows .",
    "a configuration of the network at finite temperature @xmath49 is first relaxed to the closest minimum in the potential energy landscape @xmath154 , i.e. the closest `` inherent structure '' , by slowly draining energy from the system by means of a fictitious frictional force proportional to the particles velocity added on top of the usual interaction .",
    "we find this procedure more effective than a direct energy minimization , probably owing to the floppiness of the network translating into large nearly flat regions in the potential landscape .",
    "denoting with @xmath155 the relaxation procedure , we can formally write @xmath156",
    ".    we then apply a small , instantaneous , homogeneous shear deformation @xmath157 to the simulation box , obtaining the configuration @xmath158 . finally , we relax the configuration to the nearest inherent structure , obtaining @xmath159 . the non - affine displacement field induced by the shear strain @xmath160",
    "is defined as @xmath161 , where the difference between configurations is to be understood as the set of differences of the positions of corresponding particles .",
    "this basic step can be iterated any number of times to obtain the non - affine displacement field corresponding to a strain @xmath153 : @xmath162 .",
    "we have performed the analysis on six independent gel configurations with @xmath20 particles , deforming with steps of @xmath163 strain , up to a final strain @xmath164 .",
    "the configurations are the same as the ones used for the iso - configurational analysis .",
    "we quantify the correlation between the magnitude of the non - affine displacements and the local density of crosslinks by means of pearson s coefficient of correlation @xmath165 .",
    "the correlation coefficients corresponding to different strains are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : nad_corr ] .",
    "we find a consistent negative correlation , meaning that the larger non - affine displacements happen preferentially in regions with low density of crosslinks .",

    "<S> hence a significantly more complex scenario emerges for the mechanical response , where the mesoscale organization of the gel network has a significant role . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that under deformation higher tensile stresses are likely to build up , and favor bond - breaking , in densely connected regions . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , non - affine displacements under deformation are related to the irreversible rearrangements responsible for local plastic events @xcite that hinder relaxation of local stresses upon unloading the material . </S>",
    "<S> this microscopic , quantitative information , available from our study , on when and where local irreversible events are more likely to occur , can now be incorporated into non - local constitutive models for the viscoelastic response of colloidal gels and similar materials .    </S>",
