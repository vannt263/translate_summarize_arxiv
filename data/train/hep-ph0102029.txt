    "in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) @xcite , radiative corrections involving supersymmetric ( susy ) particles modify the tree level relation between fermion masses and their yukawa couplings @xcite . in this paper",
    "we review the sources and behavior of these susy yukawa corrections and describe their phenomenological effects .",
    "the behavior of the susy yukawa corrections is most easily derived in the context of an effective field theory ( eft ) , in which we take the low energy effective theory of the mssm below the susy scale to be a two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) and absorb the effects of susy radiative corrections into the parameters of the eft . at tree level , the fermion yukawa couplings and masses arise from the lagrangian , @xmath2      + { \\rm h.c . } \\ ] ] where we use third generation quark notation and the higgs doublets are @xmath3 the higgs vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) are constrained by @xmath4 and their ratio is parameterized by @xmath5 .",
    "the fermion masses arise from replacing the higgs fields with their vevs : @xmath6 so that @xmath7 and @xmath8 . at tree level ,",
    "down - type fermions receive their masses from @xmath9 while up - type fermions receive their masses from @xmath10 .",
    "this is a consequence of the holomorphicity of the superpotential in unbroken susy ; if susy were unbroken , it would be true to all orders in the eft .    in a model with more than one higgs doublet , tree - level",
    "flavor - changing neutral higgs couplings can be eliminated if the right - handed fermion singlets with each value of hypercharge are allowed to couple to only one higgs doublet @xcite . under this requirement , called `` natural flavor conservation '' , there are two different configurations possible for the couplings of the two higgs doublets @xmath9 and @xmath10 of a 2hdm to quarks : in the type i 2hdm all the quarks couple to @xmath9 and none to @xmath10 , while in the type ii 2hdm the down - type right - handed quark singlets couple to @xmath9 while the up - type right - handed quark singlets couple to @xmath10 .",
    "the most general 2hdm without natural flavor conservation , in which the right - handed fermion singlets with each value of hypercharge couple to both higgs doublets , is called the type iii 2hdm . in unbroken susy",
    ", the higgs couplings take the form of a type ii 2hdm .",
    "however , susy must be broken in nature .",
    "when susy is broken , non - holomorphic higgs couplings to fermions arise at one loop in the eft .",
    "we first consider down - type fermions . at one loop , diagrams such as those in fig .",

    "[ eq : effectivel ] , we see that in the eft , the right - handed down - type quarks couple to both @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "thus,_the low energy effective theory of the mssm is a type iii 2hdm_.    the @xmath11 quark mass at one loop is obtained by inserting the higgs vevs into eq .",
    "[ eq : effectivel ] : @xmath13 solving for @xmath14 we find , @xmath15 here @xmath16 because of the loop suppression . however , the third term in eq .",

    "( so that @xmath18 ) and generate the down - type quark masses at one loop through susy breaking terms . ] at tree level , @xmath19 . at one loop , @xmath17 can be significantly smaller or larger than the tree - level value , depending on the sign of @xmath20 .    in the up - type fermion sector ,",
    "an analogous calculation gives , @xmath21 in particular , there is no @xmath0 enhancement and the corrections to the relation between @xmath22 and @xmath23 are small .",
    "these corrections can still be important ; for example , they enter the mssm higgs mass calculation at the two loop level and lead to a few gev change in the upper bound on @xmath24 in some regions of parameter space @xcite .",
    "we now examine the behavior of @xmath25 as the susy mass scale is varied .",
    "it is easy to see from , e.g. , the first diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : mssmdiags2 ] that @xmath25 are independent of @xmath26 .",
    "this diagram scales like @xmath27 , where the factor of @xmath28 comes from a helicity flip in the gluino line , the factor of @xmath29 comes from the dimensionful higgs - squark - squark coupling , and the factor of @xmath30 comes from the three - point loop integral ( here @xmath26 is the largest of the masses in the loop and we neglect external momenta ; see eq .",
    "[ eq : iabc ] ) .",
    "thus if all the soft susy breaking parameters and the @xmath29 parameter are scaled by a common factor , @xmath25 are unchanged ; i.e. , they do not decouple with @xmath26 when the ratios between susy parameters are held fixed .",
    "these susy yukawa corrections are also universal ; i.e. , they are independent of the external momenta and thus process - independent . in general ,",
    "there are additional contributions to physical processes at one loop that depend on the external momenta ; however , these are suppressed by powers of @xmath31 .    although @xmath25 do not decouple with @xmath26",
    ", they do not represent a violation of the decoupling theorem @xcite : in the limit of large pseudoscalar higgs mass @xmath32 , the effects of @xmath25 appear only in the couplings of the heavy higgs bosons , as we will now illustrate . because in the type iii 2hdm the right - handed down - type fermions couple to both higgs doublets , there is no longer a special yukawa basis for the higgs fields .",
    "we are then free to write them in a new basis chosen such that one of the doublets has zero vev ( the `` vev basis '' ) : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the standard model ( sm ) higgs vev and we have performed the rotation ( @xmath35 ) @xmath36 note that in the vev basis @xmath37 contains the goldstone bosons while @xmath38 contains @xmath39 and @xmath40",
    ". the two cp - even neutral higgs mass eigenstates @xmath41 and @xmath42 are given in terms of @xmath43 and @xmath44 by @xmath45 in the limit of large @xmath32 , @xmath46 goes to zero : @xmath47 so @xmath48 .",
    "thus in the limit of large @xmath32 , @xmath37 contains the goldstone bosons , the sm higgs vev , and the light higgs boson @xmath41 , while @xmath38 contains all the heavy higgs states , @xmath49 , @xmath40 and @xmath42 .",
    "the effective lagrangian in the vev basis can be written as , @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the yukawa couplings in the vev basis . inserting the higgs vevs we obtain the @xmath11 quark mass : @xmath53 in particular ,",
    "@xmath54 is fixed by the @xmath11 quark mass , while @xmath52 is unconstrained .",
    "thus the coupling of @xmath37 to quarks must be sm - like while that of @xmath38 is unconstrained and can contain the effects of @xmath25 .",
    "in the decoupling limit @xcite of large @xmath32 , @xmath48 so the @xmath55 coupling approaches its sm value , while the effects of @xmath25 are confined to the heavy higgs bosons in @xmath38 .",
    "we now write down the susy radiative corrections to the down - type mass - yukawa relation ( keeping only the @xmath0 enhanced contributions ) @xcite : @xmath56 where the correction @xmath57 is given by   is proportional to the product @xmath58 , it has been suggested in ref .",

    "@xcite that eq .",
    "[ eq : ybmb ] receives no higher order @xmath0 enhanced contributions relies on the facts ( 1 ) that @xmath0 enters the calculation at higher orders only multiplied by @xmath14 , e.g. , from the @xmath68 term in the bottom squark mass matrix ; and ( 2 ) that no factors of @xmath69 can arise from the loop diagrams to cancel the @xmath14 factor multiplying @xmath0 , because the yukawa coupling operator is dimension four .",

    "accurate knowledge of the @xmath71 branching ratio is important for determining the reach of the upcoming higgs searches at the tevatron and lhc @xcite .",
    "also , once a light higgs boson is discovered , precision measurements of its branching ratios ( e.g. , at a future @xmath74 linear collider ) can be used to distinguish a sm higgs boson from a mssm higgs boson in some regions of parameter space @xcite .",
    "the susy yukawa corrections can have a significant effect on these branching ratios @xcite .",
    "for example , the ratio @xmath75 is sensitive to the susy yukawa corrections to @xmath71 .",

    "thus in the context of the mssm , a deviation of @xmath75 from its sm value provides a direct window onto the susy yukawa corrections @xcite .",

    "when @xmath32 is small and @xmath0 is large , @xmath102 can be quite small , of the same order as its one loop radiative corrections .",

    "we expect the chargino - squark - quark couplings to receive large corrections relative to the @xmath150-quark - quark couplings because susy - breaking effects will lead to different results for the flavor changing susy bubble diagrams in the external down - type quark and down - type squark lines .",
    "the susy radiative corrections that lead to flavor changing neutral higgs couplings are enhanced by @xmath0 and can be quite large , as we have seen . as in the flavor conserving case , these @xmath0 enhanced corrections should be resummed .",
    "such a resummation has been performed recently in ref .",
    "@xcite for higher - order corrections to @xmath134 , following the results in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , it is unclear whether this procedure will work in general because it is unclear whether the proof in ref .",
    "@xcite that all higher order @xmath0 enhanced terms are automatically resummed if the relation in eq .",
    "[ eq : ybmb ] is used is applicable to the flavor changing case .",
    "for example , factors of @xmath151 or @xmath152 can in principle arise at higher orders .",
    "this issue should be clarified before the resummation procedure is applied to additional flavor changing processes .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath0 enhanced susy corrections to the relation between down - type fermion masses and their yukawa couplings has the potential to be a good handle on the mssm at large @xmath0 .",
    "these corrections lead to large effects in both higgs physics and @xmath1 physics . because these effects can be quite large , reliable calculations are needed . in higgs boson",
    "decays , the external momenta are on the order of the electroweak scale and their effects should be included through diagrammatic calculations ; these are available for the susy - qcd corrections to @xmath71 and calculations are in progress for the susy - electroweak corrections to both @xmath71 and @xmath153 .",
    "in addition , resummation of higher order @xmath0 enhanced contributions beyond the one loop level is very important in some regions of parameter space .",
    "this resummation is well known and straightforward in the eft approach but should also be incorporated into the diagrammatic calculations . in flavor",
    "changing processes such as rare @xmath1 meson decays and ckm matrix renormalization , it is not entirely clear how the resummation should be done . finally , the susy corrections to the ckm matrix may have a significant effect on the @xmath49 and chargino couplings to ( s)fermions relative to the @xmath131 couplings . in short , the @xmath0",
    "enhanced susy corrections to the relation between down - type fermion masses and their yukawa couplings offer a wide range of challenges and opportunities for mssm phenomenology .",
