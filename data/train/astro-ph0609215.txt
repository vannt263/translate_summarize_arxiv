    "the iron k - shell lines near the galactic center ( gcdx ) was first detected with the ginga satellite @xcite .",
    "the line energy is about 6.7  kev and the emission extends about 12@xmath3 over the galactic center ( gc ) region .",
    "the asca satellite observed more details of the gc region , and confirmed the nature of the gcdx @xcite .",
    "moreover , the asca ccd resolved the iron k - shell line detected with ginga into three distinct lines at 6.4 , 6.7 and 6.9  kev @xcite .",
    "the 6.7 and 6.9  kev lines are likely due to he - like ( fe ) and hydrogenic ( fe ) ions of iron .",
    "there are three plausible scenarios that have been proposed for the origin of the iron k - shell lines .",
    "one is collisional excitation ( ce ) by low energy electrons ( lee ) , similar to the galactic ridge emission .",
    "this process , however , contributes mainly to the 6.4 kev line emission , and not to the 6.7 and 6.9  kev lines ( valinia et al .",
    "2000 ) . with respect to the 6.7 kev and 6.9 kev lines ,",
    "ce in a thin , high temperature plasma , and charge exchange ( cx ) recombination are both considered . for the ce case ,",
    "the best - fit thin thermal plasma temperature of the gcdx spectrum was @xmath410  kev .",
    "if the gcdx is really due to a thin hot and uniformly distributed plasma , the total thermal energy is estimated to be 10@xmath5  erg , or equivalent to 10@xmath610@xmath7 supernovae explosions .",
    "the temperature of @xmath410  kev is higher than that bounded by the galactic gravity , hence the plasma should escape from the gc region .",
    "the time scale estimated by the plasma size ( 1@xmath3 or @xmath4 150  pc at 8.5 kpc ) divided by the sound velocity of the @xmath410  kev plasma is @xmath410@xmath8 years .",
    "therefore the energy of @xmath410@xmath5  erg should be supplied in the past @xmath410@xmath8 years , e.g. 1 sn every 1001000 year is required in the gc region .",
    "this huge energy budget in the gc region suggests that cx recombination may be a more reasonable explanation for the gcdx . in this scenario , during a collision between neutral hydrogen and fe or fe , the bound hydrogen electron is captured into an excited state of the iron , and then the excited state decays producing an x - ray .",
    "the x - ray spectral signature is distinct from the signature produced by ce in a collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) plasma , such as the high - temperature plasma mentioned above . in the cx case ,",
    "the forbidden line at @xmath9  ev , is stronger than the resonance line at @xmath10  ev @xcite , whereas the resonance line is stronger in the case of a plasma in cie .",
    "thus , even if the resonance and forbidden lines are not completely resolved , the energy centroid of the k@xmath0 line of fe produced by cx will be lower than produced by ce .",
    "we also note that an energy shift towards lower energy as the cx would be observed in the case of x - ray emission following recombination with low energy electrons , as in a photo - ionized plasma @xcite .",
    "the 6.4  kev line is likely to be k@xmath0 from the neutral and/or a blend of low charge states of iron ( here , fe ) .",
    "in fact , the 6.4  kev line is localized near molecular clouds such as the radio complex sgr b2 and the radio arc regions .",
    "sgr b2 , the most massive giant molecular cloud with ultra compact h ( uch ) and many maser sources , has been extensively studied with asca and chandra ( @xcite ; @xcite , 2001 ) . as a result of those studies",
    ", the authors proposed that the 6.4  kev line arises in an x - ray reflection nebula ( xrn ) irradiated by sgr a@xmath11 during an exceptionally bright period that occurred about 300 years ago , i.e. , a time span equivalent to the light traveling time between sgr b2 and sgr a@xmath11 .",
    "this putative high activity of sgr a@xmath11 could provide the energy supply to the gcdx .",
    "accordingly , a high quality observation of the iron and nickel k - shell lines can provide key information for understanding the origin of the gcdx . using the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) ( koyama et al .",
    "2006a ) , we have measured x - ray emission for the spectral band containing these lines .",
    "the xis is the x - ray ccd camera system on board suzaku ( @xcite ) .",
    "the excellent energy resolution and well - calibrated performance for diffuse sources , coupled with the low background orbit of suzaku , make the xis well - suited to provide crucial information about the gcdx .",
    "here we present the results of the first measurement of the gcdx with the xis focusing on the k - shell emission from iron and nickel .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]      + @xmath12 from wargelin et  al . ( 2005 ) .",
    "+      the relatively high resolution of the xis also affords us the ability to extract crucial information from the line feature of fe  ly@xmath0 provides further evidence against the cx process for x - ray production . as discussed in section 4.3 ,",
    "the intrinsic line broadening of ly@xmath0 is nearly zero , and it follows that if cx is the source of the x - ray emission , then recombination would occur when the bare iron velocity is nearly zero , i.e. , the collision energy between the iron ion and neutral hydrogen is small . in such a low - collision energy case ,",
    "electrons are non - statistically captured into levels with large principal quantum numbers ( @xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "we , however , see no enhancement at the fe  rydberg series limit at 9.2  kev .",
    "our measurements gives an upper limit of @xmath14  photons  s@xmath15  @xmath16 for the high-@xmath17 rydberg series line emission ( we assumed a gaussian line with width of 30  ev ) , only about 6% of the intensity of ly@xmath0 .",
    "this upper limit corresponds to a lower limit of collision energy of 100  ev amu@xmath15 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) between bare fe nuclei and neutral h. for that collision energy , the velocity of bare iron nuclei must be larger than @xmath4150  km  s@xmath15",
    ". therefore the cx process , if present in the gcdx , gives a lower limit on the velocity of @xmath4150  km  s@xmath15 .",
    "@xcite suggested that the cx process may have the maximum cross section at a higher iron velocity of @xmath18 km s@xmath15 , hence the subsequent decay lines have widths of about 100  ev .",
    "no such large broadening is observed in fe  ly@xmath0 .",
    "together with the discussion of section 4.4 , we therefore propose that the 6.7  kev and 6.9  kev lines in the gcdx are likely due to a cie plasma and would not arise from a cx process .",
    "the k - shell lines of fe  k@xmath0 and fe  ly@xmath0 were discovered with the data from asca  @xcite , chandra  @xcite and xmm - newton  @xcite . with suzaku",
    ", we have , for the first time , detected ni  k@xmath0 , and fe  k@xmath1 and fe  ly@xmath1 .",
    "we have also tentatively identified fe  k@xmath2 and fe  ly@xmath2 ( see table 2 ) . as discussed in sections 4.4 and 4.5 ,",
    "the emission lines from these highly ionized atoms are likely due to collisional excitation in a thin thermal plasma .",
    "the best - fit flux ratio of fe - ly@xmath0/fe - k@xmath0 is 0.33@xmath190.02 , which provides an ionization temperature of 6.4@xmath190.2  kev .",
    "the best - fit flux ratio of fe - k@xmath1/fe - k@xmath0 is 0.092@xmath20 , which gives the electron temperature of 6.6@xmath21  kev .",
    "although the error is still large , this electron temperature is similar to the ionization temperature .",
    "the line flux ratio of ni - k@xmath0/fe - k@xmath0 is 0.078 . with the further assumption that the relative abundances of iron and nickel are proportional to the solar value",
    ", this ratio is converted to the plasma temperature of @xmath45.4  kev .",
    "we therefore conclude that the gcdx plasma has a temperature of @xmath457 kev in collisional ionization equilibrium . the observed flux ratios of fe - ly@xmath1/fe - ly@xmath0 , fe - k@xmath2/fe - k@xmath0 fr and fe - ly@xmath2/fe - ly@xmath0 from are consistent with this plasma condition .",
    "although we show that the gcdx is attributable to a high temperature plasma of @xmath4 57 kev in collisional ionization equilibrium , whether the origin is diffuse or the integrated emission of a large number of unresolved point sources , is not yet clear .",
    "we therefore investigated the spatial variation of the gcdx in temperature and flux .",
    "we made a series of x - ray spectra in @xmath22 arc - min rectangles along the galactic plane of @xmath23 ( figure [ fig : boxreg ] ) , then extracted the fluxes of the 6.7 and 6.9  kev lines , applying the same model as is given in table [ tabl : lines ] .",
    "the plots of the flux ratio between the 6.7 and 6.9  kev lines , and the fluxes of the 6.7 kev line are given in figure [ fig : ratio ] and figure [ fig : ps_diff ] , respectively , in which the flux and flux ratio of the bright snr sgr a east are excluded .",
    "we see that the 6.7 and 6.9  kev line ratio is constant at @xmath24 in the negative longitude region from @xmath25 to @xmath26 , but decreases to @xmath27 at the positive longitude near at @xmath28",
    ". the ratios of 0.38 and 0.30 suggest ionization temperatures of 6.8  kev and 6.2  kev , respectively .",
    "the smooth and monotonic variation of the ionization temperature along the galactic longitude argues that the gcdx is not due to the superposition of the outputs of a large number of unresolved point sources .",
    "we simulated the point - source flux in the 4.78.0  kev band observed with xis , putting the positions and fluxes ( 2.08.0  kev band ) of the chandra cataloged sources @xcite in the same rectangles of figure 4 . to preserve completeness limit , we selected the sources with flux larger than 5@xmath29 photons  @xmath16  s@xmath15 in the 2.08.0  kev band .",
    "after convolving the response of the xrt + xis , we extracted the integrated point - source fluxes from each rectangle .",
    "the results are plotted in the same figure of the 6.7 kev line ( figure [ fig : ps_diff ] ) .",
    "the integrated point - source flux is symmetrically distributed between positive and negative galactic longitude with a sharp peak at sgr a@xmath11 ( @xmath30 ) , which is significantly different from the 6.7 kev line flux distribution .",
    "the 6.7 kev line flux shows an asymmetric distribution ( larger flux at the positive galactic longitude than the negative side ) and a gradual increase towards sgr a@xmath11 .",
    "these facts suggest that the major fraction of the 6.7 kev line flux is not due to the integrated emission of unresolved point sources , but is truly diffuse .",
    "( 70mm,50mm)figure4.eps    ( 70mm,50mm)figure5.eps    ( 70mm,50mm)figure6.eps      from the line diagnostics , the gcdx is most likely produced by a thin hot plasma with a temperature of @xmath457  kev in cie , while the bremsstrahlung temperature determined with the continuum shape in the 5.511.5  kev band is @xmath415  kev(see table 2 ) , significantly higher than @xmath457  kev .",
    "this suggests that the continuum flux may contain an additional hard component .",
    "we therefore fit the spectrum with a model of a cie plasma and power - law component with 3 gaussians for the k - shell emissions from fe and ni . in this model ,",
    "the k - edge absorption with @xmath31 is also implemented .",
    "although its contribution is minor , we added the model spectrum of the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) .",
    "as discussed in section 3.2 , there are systematic errors in the line width ( @xmath430 ev ) and center energy ( @xmath32  ev ) .",
    "we therefore introduced an artificial random motion and small red - shift to cancel these systematic errors .",
    "the fit is reasonably good and the best - fit results and parameters are given in figure [ fig : apecfit ] and table [ tabl : vapec ] .",
    "we note that the forbidden line of ni and some of the satellite lines are missing in the apec model , hence the ni abundance may be overestimated .",

    "+    one notable finding is the presence of power - law hard tail . the power - law index @xmath43 is sensitive to the slope of the high energy continuum . because the effective area of the xrt - xis combination drops rapidly at high energy , our determination of the power - law index @xmath43 has a relatively large statistical error of @xmath561.4@xmath44 .",
    "the low numbers of counts make it challenging to determine the error contribution from systematic effects . to provide a more reliable estimate of the systematic error , we checked it using the spectrum of the crab nebula .",
    "we examined the variation of the best - fit @xmath43 by fitting the crab spectrum in the 410 , 510 , 610 and 710  kev bands , and found no systematic variations with the increasing energy band .",
    "the mean variations of @xmath43 are within 5% for all the xiss , which is far smaller than the statistical error of @xmath440% .",
    "since the flux level of the nxbg becomes comparable to the hard tail flux at 810 kev , it may be argued that the error due to the nxbg - subtraction should not be ignored .",
    "the possible flux error of the nxbg is estimated to be @xmath573% ( koyama et al . 2006a ) . including this error in the spectrum , the best - fit @xmath43 are 1.4 ( adding 3% of the nxbg ) and 1.2 ( 3% reduction of the nxbg ) . further systematic analysis of the nxbg found a hint that the flux of the night earth data is smaller than that from a blank sky .",
    "the details of the flux difference is still in study , but is at a level of @xmath58 10% at the 811 kev band .",
    "if we use a nxbg of 1.1@xmath59 of the night earth , then the best - fit @xmath43 becomes 1.5 .",
    "thus any possible systematic error of nxbg does not change the conclusion that a flat hard tail is present in the gcdx .",
    "in addition , the flux of the cxb is more than one order of magnitude smaller than the hard tail in the hard x - ray band , so that the fluctuation and/or error of the cxb can be ignored .",
    "a possible contributor of the power - law hard tail is non - thermal filament structures found with chandra ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the power - law flux in the positive galactic longitude ( gc_sr1 ) is significantly larger than that of the negative galactic longitude ( gc_sr2 ) , which is a trend similar to the population of the non - thermal filaments ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of the non - thermal emission is a key for understanding the presence of high energy particles , which are suggested by the detection of very high energy gamma - rays ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "further analysis of the xis data in combination with those of the hard x - ray detector(hxd ) ( @xcite ) could yield an important contribution to the study of this hard component .",
    "since the difference between the theoretical ( 6966  ev ) and observed ( 6969@xmath60  ev ) values of fe  ly@xmath0 is only 3  ev , we can assume that the detector gain and uniformity are well - calibrated to study features at this level of accuracy .",
    "2 .   the abundance of fe in the interstellar gas near the gc appears to be 3.5 times solar .",
    "the 6.4  kev ( k@xmath0 of neutral iron ) line from the gc region could be contaminated by those of low ionization states , but still characteristic of gas at temperature much lower than those in which the helium - like lines arise .",
