    "the thermodynamic potential and the correlation functions of ideal bose gas ( ibg )  @xcite were studied in a number of preceding papers  @xcite ; see also the review  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall present a brief review of known results together with an unified treatment of critical properties of ibg based on the derivation of effective free energy of landau - ginzburg type .",
    "our consideration makes possible to outline a general picture of the critical behaviour of ibg as well as to present some new results about the effects of thermodynamic constraints : the conditions of constant volume ( @xmath2 ) and constant pressure ( @xmath3 ) for certain spatial dimensionalities ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "we should emphasize that the thermodynamic behaviour of ibg near the @xmath1point corresponds either to a phase transition of first order or , in cases which we shall enumerate , resembles a continuous phase transition that is not equivalent to the standard second order phase transition described by  @xmath5model ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "our results could be used in the interpretation of thermodynamic behaviour of extremely dilute bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) , where the interparticle interaction can be neglected .",
    "we consider noninteracting and homogeneous gas of spinless bosons , described by the hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath6,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the modulus of the chemical potential @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the @xmath10-dimensional wave vector , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are second quantization operators , and @xmath13 is the total number of bosons .",
    "the external field @xmath14 generates the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( @xmath15 ) below the critical temperature @xmath16 .",
    "the energy spectrum @xmath17 includes two cases : ( i ) @xmath18 , corresponding to real boson particles and boson excitations produced by short - range interparticle ( fermion and spin ) interactions , and ( ii ) @xmath19 , which stands for boson excitations ( composite bosons ) produced by long - range interparticle interactions ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the parameter @xmath20 is equal to @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the effective mass of the bosons .    the grand canonical thermodynamic potential of ibg",
    ", @xmath23 can be exactly calculated  @xcite .",
    "this quantity can be written in general form    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the thermal wavelength ,    @xmath26    is the integral bose function ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) and    @xmath27    is a constant with the property @xmath28 .",
    "note , that the grand potential ( 3 ) obeys differential relation @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the entropy and @xmath31 is the order parameter of bec .",
    "the free energy @xmath32 , in which the natural thermodynamic variable is the order parameter @xmath33 , can be obtained from @xmath34 through the standard legendre transformation    @xmath35    using eqs .",
    "( 3)-(7 ) we obtain    @xmath36    we can restrict our calculations without a loss of generality to real values of @xmath14 and @xmath33 .",
    "the susceptibility is given by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the susceptibility critical exponent and @xmath39 ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "for small @xmath40 and energies @xmath41 the correlation function @xmath42 takes the form @xmath43 .",
    "this gives the correlation length @xmath44 and @xmath45 at @xmath46 .",
    "from @xmath45 we obtain that the fisher exponent @xmath47 , defined by @xmath48 , is equal to ( @xmath49 ) for all dimensional ranges and constraints ( see table 1 ) . in order to obtain the correlation length exponent @xmath50 and the exponent @xmath38 of susceptibility @xmath51 , we need to derive the function @xmath52 for a general spatial dimensionality @xmath10 for cases of constant volume and constant pressure .",
    "the nullifying of chemical potential defines the critical temperature @xmath16 of bec for both cases ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) .",
    "for the thermodynamic condition of constant volume we need the free energy @xmath55 , in which the natural variable is the volume @xmath56 ( or the number density @xmath57 ) . to obtain it we expand the integral bose function @xmath58 in powers of @xmath59 and express the chemical potential as a function of the volume ( or density ) .",
    "we expand the function @xmath60 in the potential @xmath61 to the same order in @xmath59 .",
    "this allows to make the next legendre transformation    @xmath62    where    @xmath63    @xmath64 and @xmath65 . subtracting the free energy of the disordered phase @xmath66 we obtain the following effective free energies corresponding to several dimensionality ranges :    @xmath67    the case @xmath68 is depicted in fig .  1 for @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we take the volume per particle @xmath71 to be unity and @xmath72 . the number coefficient in eq .  (",
    "11 ) is equal to @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "when the temperature tends to zero the curve @xmath75 acquires a flat part , indicating that the order parameter @xmath33 occurs with a jump at @xmath74 . in fig .",
    "2 we show the @xmath76 case , when @xmath77 and @xmath70 . now the numerical factor in eq .  ( 11 ) is 8.96 and the normalization @xmath78 has been used .",
    "the function @xmath75 , shown in figs .  1 and 2 , is quite different from the respective potential @xmath75 known for the usual cases of ibg ( @xmath79 , @xmath70 )  @xcite and the  @xmath5model  @xcite .    using the free energy ( 11 ) we calculate the specific heat at constant volume @xmath80 ) and the equation of state @xmath81 . bearing in mind the definitions ( see , e.g. ,",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath82 , @xmath83 @xmath84 and @xmath85 @xmath86 we obtain the critical exponents @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the values of the critical exponents are given in table 1 .",
    "thus @xmath90 is said to have exponent @xmath91 or @xmath92 , respectively , if @xmath93 or @xmath94  @xcite . ] .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath33 , @xmath56 , @xmath30 , @xmath95 and @xmath51 at @xmath16 is given in table 2 .",
    "when the system is under constant pressure we should use the free energy per particle @xmath8 , in which the natural variable is the pressure @xmath96 . to obtain the chemical potential we solve the equation for the pressure @xmath97 with respect to the volume per particle @xmath98 to the lowest order in @xmath99 .",
    "thus we make the following legendre transformation    @xmath100    where @xmath101 and @xmath102 .    for the various dimensional ranges",
    "we obtain    @xmath103    in fig .",
    "3 we depict the case @xmath104 for @xmath79 and @xmath70 .",
    "we set again @xmath72 and take the magnitude of the pressure @xmath96 so as to give @xmath105 .",
    "this gives the factor @xmath106 for the coefficient of proportionality in eq .",
    "this picture should be compared with those shown in figs .  1 and 2 ( see , also ,  @xcite ) .",
    "we derive from the free energy @xmath8 the specific heat at constant pressure @xmath107 ) and the exponent @xmath87 .",
    "moreover the chemical potential ( 13 ) can be used to calculate the correlation length and susceptibility exponents @xmath50 and @xmath38 .",
    "since the order parameter has a jump , as is seen from eq .",
    "( 13 ) ( @xmath8 is zero below @xmath16 ) , the exponents @xmath89 and @xmath88 can not be defined .",
    "the values of the critical exponents and the behaviour of @xmath33 , @xmath56 , @xmath30 , @xmath108 and @xmath51 at @xmath16 are given in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "in this paper we derived and analyzed the ibg free energies of landau - ginzburg type for the thermodynamic constraints of constant volume and constant pressure at different spatial dimensionalities @xmath0 .",
    "the values of the critical exponents for various spatial dimensionalities are given in table 1 .",
    "the critical exponents for @xmath109 and @xmath54 are new results of our investigation .",
    "the derived free energies enable us to present the behaviour of thermodynamic functions at the critical point .",
    "it is shown in table 2 .",
    "besides , our results make possible to estimate the order of the phase transition to bec . when @xmath110 and @xmath54 this phase transition is of first order .",
    "but for lower dimensionalities ( @xmath111 ) and in both cases ( @xmath112 ) , the phase transition to bec resembles a first order phase transition only by the order parameter jump . on the other hand , for @xmath110 and @xmath53 the phase transition to bec is a continuous phase transition with properties , which are quite different from the properties of the standard second order phase transition described by  @xmath5model .",
    "our results can be used in the interpretation of experimental results for bec in extremely dilute boson gases at constant pressure or volume .",
