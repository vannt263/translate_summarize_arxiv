    "an important class of approximations in many - body theory are mean - field approximations , which reduce the many - body problem to an effective one - body problem , and their generalizations @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider the hartree - fock approximation , a variational approach that approximates the ground state wavefunction by a single slater determinant ( antisymmeterized product of single - particle wavefunctions ) , and the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , which builds small amplitude correlations on top of the hartree - fock state , and which itself can be derived as the small - amplitude limit of the _ time - dependent _ hartree - fock approximation .",
    "because the hartree - fock ( hf ) state ignores correlations , it can break exact symmetries , such as translational and rotational invariance . a related approximation ,",
    "the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) approximation , built upon quasi - particles , also breaks conservation of the number of particles . despite this breaking of symmetries , hf , hfb , and the rpa and quasi - particle rpa",
    "are widely and successfully used to describe low - energy nuclear structure .",
    "if one dials the parameters of the hamiltonian , it is possible for the ground state hf or hfb wavefunction to change from a symmetry - preserving state to one that breaks an exact symmetry .",
    "for example , as one changes the single - particle energies as one attempts to fit data , the hf state may go between spherical and deformed states , and the hfb state may between normal ( number - conserving ) and superfluid ( number - nonconserving ) states .",
    "a long time ago thouless pointed out @xcite that , as the mean - field state is driven between symmetry - conserving ( sc ) and symmetry - nonconserving ( snc ) states , there are two possible kinds of state transitions ( often referred to as `` phase transitions '' in the literature , even for finite systems ) . for second - order transitions",
    "the fluctuations in rpa become unphysically large , leading to the so - called `` collapse '' of the rpa .",
    "a frequently cited example is the collapse of rpa in the lipkin - meshkov - glick model @xcite .",
    "significant effort in the literature has been devoted to collapse in the rpa and qrpa and possible solutions .",
    "all but forgotten are first - order transitions for which rpa does _ not _ collapse .",
    "in this paper we use a non - trivial realization of the hf and rpa in the interacting shell model , where we can compare to exact numerical calculations , and demonstrate both first- and second - order transitions . as predicted by thouless , second - order transitions and collapse",
    "are driven by odd - parity operators or modes , while first - order transitions are driven by even - parity operators or modes . in this paper",
    "we do not propose any new solutions to the collapse of rpa at or near second - order transitions ; instead , this work illustrates that the world of rpa and state transitions is more complicated than the standard narrative .",
    "we work in the framework of the interacting shell model .",
    "the model space is defined by a truncated set of single - particle orbits , for example the @xmath0-@xmath1 space , usually called the _ p_-shell , or the @xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath4 space , the _ sd _ shell .",
    "the interaction is given by a set of single - particle energies @xmath5 and two - body matrix elements @xmath6 .",
    "the interactions used are not necessarily simple schematic forces but generally start from carefully computed @xmath7-matrix interactions and then adjusted empirically to reproduce a large number of ground state binding energies and excitation energies .",
    "there are a number of computer programs that read in the model space , generate many - body basis states ( slater determinants in occupation space ) , compute the many - body matrix elements from the single - particle energies and two - body matrix elements , and diagonalize the hamiltonian matrix to get out the eigenenergies and wavefunctions , from which one can compute observables , transitions , etc .. for this paper we used the redstick shell model code@xcite .    for hartree - fock plus rpa ,",
    "we have use the sherpa ( shell - model rpa ) code @xcite which uses exactly the same input as redstick .",
    "sherpa places no restriction on the hartree - fock wavefunction except that it must be purely real ; otherwise it can have any arbitrary deformation contained in the model space .",
    "thus one can have spherical , axially symmetric deformation , triaxial deformation , and even parity - mixed ground state .",
    "in previous papers we have used sherpa to directly test hf+rpa as an approximation to full shell - model diagonalization , looking at correlation energies@xcite , ground state observables@xcite , electromagnetic transitions@xcite , and charge - changing gamow - teller transitions@xcite . in presenting those results",
    "we were frequenly asked about the issue of the collapse of rpa .",
    "such questions motivated this paper .",
    "in this section we revisit thouless arguments @xcite regarding the order of the transition . to do this , we need to remind the reader of at least one way to develop rpa @xcite , although we do not give the derivation in full .",
    "let @xmath8 be a slater determinant , that is , an antisymmeterized product of single - particle wavefunctions . in second quantization , where @xmath9 creates a particle in state @xmath10 , we write @xmath11 we follow the usual convention where @xmath12 denote occupied states and @xmath13 denote unoccuped states .",
    "one then introduces the general particle - hole operator , @xmath14 , ( where the @xmath15 can be complex ) and the state @xmath16 which , by thouless theorem @xcite is a slater determinant not orthogonal to the starting state",
    ". one can compute @xmath17 which , assuming @xmath18 small , can be expanded @xmath19 at a local minimum , @xmath20 ; this is the hartree - fock condition , and @xmath21 is the hartree - fock energy . the quadratic terms can be treated as a harmonic oscillator : one treats the @xmath15 as boson operators and using a bogoliubov transformation put into diagonal form , using the famous rpa matrix equation : @xmath22 there can be , of course , higher - order corrections in the energy landscape beyond quadratic , which we will consider shortly .",
    "suppose one is in a sc state , e.g. , a state of good angular momentum , usually spherical , or parity .",
    "then , solving eq .",
    "( [ rpaeqn ] ) one finds the @xmath23 modes also have good symmetry .",
    "for example , with our code sherpa , if the hf state is spherically symmetric , one gets out rpa modes that have good angular momentum @xmath24 , and one sees the appropriate @xmath25 degeneracy in the rpa frequencies @xmath26 .",
    "( if , on the other hand , rotational symmetry is broken but one has axial symmetry , then one can have two - fold degeneracies , signaling rpa modes that are time - reversed of each other , or a single mode , which must be time - reversal even . in the event of triaxiality ,",
    "one has no degeneracies in the rpa spectrum . )    to consider `` state transitions , '' from sc to snc , one needs to look at higher - order terms .",
    "let @xmath27 represent generically the rpa modes ; by expanding about the hf minimum , one expands the energy landscape by @xmath28 . because we are at a minimum , @xmath29 vanishes .",
    "@xmath30 yield the curvature and the rpa frequencies .",
    "what about @xmath31 ?",
    "now we get to the heart of thouless argument .",
    "if the rpa mode @xmath27 has odd parity , while the hf state has good parity , then @xmath28 must vanish for all odd @xmath32 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath27 has even parity , then @xmath33 can be nonzero ; for example , it is possible to couple three @xmath34 operators to total angular momentum zero .",
    "figure [ pots ] illustrates both cases .",
    "[ pots](a ) is for modes with even parity , so that cubic terms play a role .",
    "one can clearly have coexisting local minima , and so one gets a first - order transition .",
    "[ pots](b ) is for odd - parity modes , so that the energy landscape must be symmetric .",
    "one tends to get only a second - order transition .    in our examples below",
    ", we see thouless predictions played out . a system with only even parity modes",
    "has first - order transitions , while a system with odd parity modes has a second - order transition .",
    "what happens in a second - order transition ? in that case the rpa frequencies @xmath35 and the fluctuations about the hf state , measured by @xmath36 , become very large , allowed because the rpa vectors have a nonstandard normalization : @xmath37 . the rpa energy is @xmath38 becomes large , the energy dives or collapses .",
    "the appearance of unphysical values is unsurprising because in the derivation one assumes small amplitudes for @xmath39 and @xmath40 .        in the published literature , discussions regarding the behavior of the rpa near",
    "a phase transition focus exclusively on collapse of rpa @xcite , that is , on second - order transitions . outside of thouless @xcite",
    "there is no discussion of first - order transitions ( indeed , the literature appears to uniformly refer to phase transitions without quantifying the order of the transition ) . yet , as illustrated below , it is not hard to find a first - order transition .",
    "it is possible that people using rpa have encountered first - order transitions without realizing it , as there is no catastrophic collapse to signal the transition .",
    "while clearly second - order transitions are more problematic , we find it instructive to explore both kinds .",
    "we begin with two case studies in the @xmath41-shell , using wildenthal s universal @xmath41 ( usd ) interaction@xcite .",
    "the first of these is @xmath42si ( 6 valence protons and 6 valence neutrons ) . by increasing the difference @xmath43 between the @xmath4 single - particle energy and the @xmath2-@xmath3 single - particle energies",
    ", we can force the hartree - fock state to go from an oblate deformed state to a spherical state with the @xmath4 shell filled . for convenience @xmath44 corresponds to the original wildenthal values .",
    "si , calculated in the full interacting shell model ( sm , solid lines ) , hartree - fock ( hf , dotted lines ) , and hartree - fock plus random phase approximation ( hf+rpa , dashed lines ) . here",
    "@xmath43 is added to the @xmath2 and @xmath3 single - particle energies ; @xmath45 corresponds to the original wildenthal values .",
    "[ si28gs ] the left - hand panel shows only the final result ; the right - hand panel identifies spherical and ( oblate ) deformed mean - field phases .",
    "note the significant region of coexistence . ]",
    "( [ si28gs ] ) shows the `` exact '' calculation , which is an interacting shell - model calculation performed in the full @xmath46 @xmath41 valence space , compared to the lowest hartree - fock energy , and the rpa correlation correction on top of the hf energy . because one switches between two degenerate hf states , the hf energy is continuous , while the hf+rpa energy is discontinuous , because the curvatures ( rpa frequencies ) are different .",
    "the right - hand panel illuminates in detail what is going on .",
    "here we explicitly show the ( oblate ) deformed and spherical hf energies and their respective rpa corrections .",
    "one sees there is a significant region of parameter space , encompassing the original wildenthal value , where locally stable deformed and spherical hf solution coexist .",
    "as we drive @xmath43 further positive or negative , eventually the deformed or spherical solutions , respectively , become unstable . in fig .",
    "( [ si28gs ] ) this is seen as the hf+rpa energy dives sharply . for further diagnosis , in the upper half of fig .",
    "( [ si28freq ] ) we plot the lowest nonzero rpa eigenfrequencies @xmath47 as a function of @xmath43 .",
    "( the deformed state also has two zero - frequency modes corresponding to broken rotational symmetries . )",
    "we see that one eigenfrequency dives to zero , signalling an instability . as further diagnosis",
    ", we give the degeneracy of the rpa eigenfrequencies ; for the spherical hf state , the degeneracy of the collapsing eigenfrequency is 5 , suggesting a quadrupole mode . for the oblate deformed state ,",
    "the rpa eigenmodes either come in time - reversed pairs ( degeneracy = 2 ) or are already time - reversal - even ( degeneracy = 1 ) .    note : we can not follow the rpa frequency all the way to zero , due to numerical instabilities , although the trend is clear .",
    "though we do not plot it , we also get a corresponding eigenvalue of the the stability matrix diving to zero .",
    "as the rpa frequency dives to zero , the corresponding magnitude of the hole - particle amplitude , @xmath48 , increases dramatically .",
    "this we plot in the lower half of fig .",
    "( [ si28freq ] ) . as discussed in a previous section ,",
    "it is this increase in @xmath49 which causes the correlation energy to take on unphysically large values .",
    "although we do not show it , we have also computed the expectation value for various operators , such as the @xmath50 operator ; while the hf contribution is stable , the rpa correlation correction @xcite also shows unphysically large values .",
    "upper panel : low - lying rpa frequencies @xmath47 for spherical ( dashed ) and deformed ( solid ) hf states .",
    "lower panel : @xmath51 corresponding to the rpa frequencies in the upper panel . in both cases",
    "the degeneracy is given in parentheses ; for the spherical case the degeneracy = @xmath52 where @xmath24 is the angular momentum of the rpa mode . [ si28freq ] ]    we also considered @xmath53s , that is , 8 valence protons and 8 valence neutrons , and drove the @xmath3 single - particle energy up and down .",
    "this case was very interesting because we could get , by adjusting @xmath43 , spherical , prolate , and triaxial solutions .",
    "( [ s32gs ] ) shows the shell - model ( sm ) , hartree - fock , and hf+rpa energies for the ground state , while fig .",
    "( [ s32freq ] ) shows the rpa frequencies and @xmath51 .",
    "while a @xmath24=2 ( degeneracy = 5 ) eigenfrequency is falling , a @xmath24=4 ( degenercy = 9 ) mode actually falls below it , suggesting that ultimately it is a hexadecupole mode becomes unstable first . the prolate state has both degenerate ( time - reversed pairs ) and non - degenerate states ; the triaxial state , which has broken all possible symmetries , has no degenerate rpa modes .    ) but for @xmath53s ; here @xmath43 is the change in the @xmath3 energy .",
    "[ s32gs ] ]    ) but for @xmath53s ; here @xmath43 is the change in the @xmath3 energy .",
    "[ s32freq ] ]    we reiterate : the key idea here is that the coexistence of locally stable phases leads to a first - order transition .",
    "the stable phases coexist easily because the parity - conserving mode  here quadrupole  means one can have cubic as well as quartic terms in the energy landscape .",
    "when we have an odd - parity mode , as illustrated in the next session , cubic terms are suppressed and one gets a second - order transition .",
    "second - order transitions lead to collapse of rpa .",
    "the classic example is the lipkin model , which in its original form has a conserved parity ( the lipkin model is a two - level system , and the original lipkin interaction could only promote or demote two particles at a time , thus providing an parity - like symmetry : either an even or an odd number of particles in the upper level ) ; the transition of the hf state in the lipkin model was from an exact parity state , with all particles in the lower level , to a mixed parity state .    for our examples of second - order transitions ,",
    "we consider a case involving shells of opposite parity .",
    "we fix the @xmath54 shell to be a closed core and have as the valence space @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "we look at @xmath57c , with 4 valence protons and 4 valence neutrons , without any truncations on the many - body space .",
    "( the only reason we leave out the @xmath3 orbit is to make full shell - model calculations tractable ; sherpa can easily handle the full @xmath58-@xmath41 space , but the hf+rpa results look very similar to what we present here .",
    "we also have looked at @xmath59o and @xmath60ne in similar spaces and get similar results . )",
    "we use the cohen - kurath ( ck ) matrix elements in the @xmath61 shell@xcite , the usd interaction @xcite in the @xmath4-@xmath2 space , and the millener - kurath ( mk ) @xmath58-@xmath41 cross - shell matrix elements@xcite . within the @xmath58 and @xmath41 spaces we use the original spacing of the single - particle energies for the ck and usd interactions , respectively , but then shift the @xmath41 single - particle energies up or down relative to the @xmath58-shell single particle energies by an amount @xmath43 ; we define @xmath45 where we get the first @xmath62 state at approximately @xmath63 mev above the ground state .",
    "the rest of the spectrum , in particular the first excited @xmath64 state , is not very good , but the idea is to have a non - trivial model , not exact reproduction of the spectrum .",

    "@xmath43 is added to the @xmath2 and @xmath4 single - particle energies ; @xmath45 puts the negative parity states in the sm at approximately the correct location .",
