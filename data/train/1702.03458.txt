    "one reason for this may be that , if one reads the source paper@xcite , one does not find the theorem stated in the generality of whittaker s enunciation .",
    "in fact , macdonald s treatment is not at all general , but is couched entirely in terms of the eponymous function @xmath3 and its derivative .",
    "hence , there is an interest in reconstructing the theorem in the generality of whittaker s description , in the hope that it may find wider contemporary interest and application .",
    "this reconstruction will be found in the next section , and numerical examples with program details will be given in section 3 , which may be useful in pedagogy .",
    "the number of zeros @xmath4 of a non - constant function @xmath0 in the region bounded by a contour at each point of which @xmath5 , @xmath6 being a constant , exceeds the number of zeros of the derived function @xmath2 in the same region by unity , the function @xmath0 being supposed analytic in the region .",
    "the proof proceeds by induction , and concentrates on the morphology of the lines of constant modulus of @xmath0 within the region .",
    "consider first the case @xmath7 , where there is exactly one zero in the region , say at @xmath8 . draw curves of constant modulus surrounding @xmath8 , for which the modulus increases towards @xmath6 .",
    "then each point in the region lies on one of these curves , and only one . indeed , if two curves for a modulus @xmath9 touched inside the region , one centred on @xmath8 and the other on a zero exterior to the region , this would give a contradiction , since equimodular lines for values intermediate between @xmath10 and @xmath6 would enclose both zeros , and thus leave the region .",
    "there are thus no zeros of @xmath2 inside the region , as required .",
    "consider next the case @xmath11 , for which there are zeros @xmath8 and @xmath12 lying inside the region .",
    "construct equimodular lines centred on @xmath8 and @xmath12 .",
    "as the specified modulus increases , there must be a value @xmath13 at which the curves first touch , at some point intermediate between @xmath8 and @xmath12 , and called by macdonald a double point .",
    "this double point has @xmath14 .",
    "equimodular lines for modulii intermediate between @xmath13 and @xmath6 enclose both zeros @xmath8 and @xmath12 , and can intersect no other equimodular lines in the region , by the argument given for @xmath7 .",
    "consider next the general case @xmath15 .",
    "we know that any system of zeros of order @xmath16 smaller than @xmath17 lying inside the contour @xmath5 must have @xmath18 zeros of @xmath2 lying inside the region , and enclosed by equimodular lines surrounding all the @xmath19 zeros .",
    "we then take @xmath20 and consider the equimodular contours around @xmath21 and the system of @xmath22 zeros . by varying the modulus value",
    ", we will arrive at a value for which the two systems of contours touch at a double point , and thereafter enclose all @xmath17 zeros until @xmath6 is reached .",
    "we thus have added one zero of @xmath2 to the @xmath23 which existed within the system of @xmath22 zeros , giving @xmath22 zeros of @xmath2 in all ( again relying on the argument given for @xmath7 ) .",
    "numerical examples illustrating the argument of section 2 may be constructed easily in mathematica , or other systems combining graphics and analytics .",
    "the mathematica code given below constructs nzin complex numbers , by choosing random real modulii and arguments for each , and uses these to construct the function giving the value of @xmath0 at @xmath24 .    _",
