    "the study of electron localization is linked to the pursuit of a rigorous systematization of the elusive concept of a chemical bond,@xcite ubiquitous in quantum chemistry ever since the first attempts of its description.@xcite the main point in the concept of electron localization is not where the electrons _ are _ ( or in quantum terms where the electrons are likely to be ) , which can be monitored from the electron density , but where the electrons _ are localized_.    the concept of localization ( and delocalization ) arises from pauli s exclusion principle : two electrons with the same spin can not occupy the same spatial position .",
    "the consequence is the appearance of the _ fermi hole _ ,  @xcite a function which determines how the probability of finding an electron at some point diminishes because of the presence of another like - spin electron in its vicinity . in other words ,",
    "the fermi hole is that part of the exchange and correlation hole that stems solely from the fermionic nature of the electron and not because of the coulomb repulsion .",
    "any electron at a given point carries its associated fermi hole as a counterpart .",
    "the localization or delocalization of the electron is equivalent to the localization or delocalization of its fermi hole .",
    "@xcite naturally , a localization descriptor should be based on this function or , correspondingly , on the like - spin pair probability function  this will be clarified below .",
    "indeed , the so - called electron localization function ( elf )  @xcite is nothing else than an appropriate renormalization of the fermi hole curvature.@xcite    the elf is large where electrons _",
    "pair_. our intuition in chemistry tells us that electrons should pair forming localized groups in each atomic shell of the inert cores , in the chemical bonds , and in the non - bonding or _",
    "lone _ pairs .",
    "more precisely , the topological properties of a good localization function should partition the space for each group of electrons  also for delocalized groups of electrons such as @xmath0 systems in conjugated molecules , for which the elf values should be low .",
    "our understanding of chemistry is founded on the electron _ pair _ , a consequence of pauli s exclusion principle , and more particularly of the localization of one electron of each spin in a region of space .",
    "accordingly , it is not surprising that the main purpose of the analysis of the elf has been to help our intuition of the fundamental chemistry concepts of pairs and bonds .    due to this focus on the elucidation of the chemical bond ,",
    "all studies of electron localization functions performed to date have referred to three - dimensional ( 3d ) systems . to our knowledge , no attempts have been made to map the electron localization in two dimensions ( 2d ) .",
    "however , significant advances in semiconductor technology have enabled the production and manipulation of low - dimensional nanoscale structures .",
    "common examples of these systems are quantum dots ( qds ) ,  @xcite often also called artificial atoms .",
    "the electrons in qds are confined in the interface of a semiconductor heterostructure , e.g. , gaas / algaas , so that the transverse dimensions controlled by a lateral confinement are considerably larger than the thickness of the qd . in most cases",
    "a 2d model describes the movement of the electrons with a reasonable accuracy . on the other hand ,",
    "the approximation for the in - plane confinement depends on the qd shape that can be , e.g. , circular , rectangular , ring - like ( quantum ring ) , or consist of several potential minima ( quantum - dot molecule ) . due to the tunable shape , size , and number of electrons ,",
    "qds have emerging applications in fields of quantum computation , and from a theoretical point of view they are an ideal playground to study many - electron phenomena and test computational methods .",
    "hence , we expect the elf to be of interest for various qd systems , since it carries valuable information about the electronic structure regardless of the dimensionality .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ section : elf ] we present a detailed derivation of the elf in 2d , focusing on the definition of the fermi - hole curvature which is the core of the elf , and show how the relevant expressions hold compared with the 3d case .",
    "we also discuss the topological properties of the elf in 2d . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we briefly present the qd model and our computational scheme based on spin - density - functional theory . in sec .",
    "[ sec : examples ] we provide four examples where the elf is a useful tool when analyzing the electronic properties of qds .",
    "they include ( i ) visualization of the shell structure of a parabolic ( harmonic ) qd , ( ii ) showing the bond - like interdot electron couplings in qd molecules , ( iii ) introducing the elf as a measure of vorticity in quantum - hall droplets , and ( iv ) visualization of vortex localization in high magnetic fields .",
    "we also show that the current - dependent term in the elf ( or in the fermi - hole curvature ) , which has been neglected in most studies until now , is relevant in order to obtain meaningful results for qds in magnetic fields .",
    "concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "in the following we go in detail through the mathematical derivation of the elf .",
    "we focus on the differences in the expressions in 3d and 2d , in particular between the spherical and circular averages and kinetic - energy densities .",
    "we consider the many - electron wave function @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the number of electrons , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the electronic position and spin coordinates , respectively .",
    "we point out that @xmath5 can be either an eigenstate of a static hamiltonian , or an evolving time - dependent state .",
    "nevertheless , we omit the time coordinate in the notation .",
    "the necessary ingredients in the derivation of the elf are the first - order reduced density matrix  @xcite @xmath6 and the diagonal of the second - order reduced density matrix factor for the second order density matrix , rather than the @xmath7 factor used by lwdin.@xcite ] @xmath8 the diagonal of @xmath9 is commonly known as the spin - density , @xmath10 and the total density , @xmath11 , sums over the spin variable .",
    "it has an easy interpretation : @xmath12 is the probability ( normalized to @xmath2 ) of finding an electron in a small volume @xmath13 at position @xmath3 .",
    "the _ pair probability density _ is defined analogously by @xmath14 and can be interpreted in the following way : @xmath15 is the probability of finding one electron at @xmath16 and , _ simultaneously _ , another electron at @xmath17 .    were the electrons fully independent , this latter probability would just be the product of the electron densities : @xmath18 . however , their exchange ( fermionic character ) and coulomb interaction reduce the pair probability by a value known as the exchange and correlation hole : @xmath19 the fermi hole is the part of @xmath20 which is entirely due to the antisymmetric character of the wave function , regardless of the coulomb interaction .",
    "accordingly , it only appears for like - spin electrons .",
    "it is the dominant part at short distances ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the key function to study the electron localization is the like - spin conditional pair probability function defined as @xmath22 the physical meaning of this function is the following .",
    "it gives the probability of finding one @xmath4-spin electron at @xmath23 knowing with certainty that another @xmath4-spin electron is at @xmath24 .",
    "the question is now how probable it is to find one like - spin electron in the vicinity of the first reference one . for this purpose",
    "it is useful to define a conditional pair probability function at a distance @xmath25 via a spherical ( in 3d ) or circular ( in 2d ) average .",
    "here we deal with the latter case , @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "since we are particularly interested in the behavior of @xmath28 at small @xmath25 , we need to perform taylor expansions , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the gradient with respect to the second electron variable in @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath31 term is absent due to pauli s exclusion principle .",
    "we now take the square , @xmath32 where @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "the circular average is @xmath35 this expression may then be used in combination with eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gamma2 ] ) , ( [ eq : condpair ] ) , and ( [ eq : condpairdist ] ) to obtain @xmath36 these equations are similar to the ones obtained in the 3d case , in fact , they are the same _ except _ for the factor @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : condpairdist2 ] ) , which is @xmath38 in 3d .",
    "the function @xmath39 satisfies exactly the same eq .",
    "( [ eq : csigma ] ) in 2d and in 3d .",
    "this is the function that measures the _ local _ like - spin pair probability , is an inverse measure of electron localization , and is the function used to define the elf .",
    "we should note also that @xmath40 is the fermi hole curvature as defined by dobson .",
    "@xcite other definitions , equivalent regarding the information that they contain , are also possible .",
    "@xcite    we conclude that the expressions that define the elf do not change significantly from 3d to 2d .",
    "the function @xmath41 alone does not reveal the localization explicitly . for that purpose one needs to perform the following renormalization , which defines the elf as   @xmath42    \\right\\}^2 } \\",
    ", , \\label{eq : elf}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 $ ] is the value of the @xmath44 function for the homogeneous electron gas ( heg ) of ( constant ) spin densities @xmath45 .",
    "analogously to the 3d case , the expression for @xmath46 in 2d is the kinetic - energy density , @xmath47 = \\tau_\\sigma[n_\\sigma ] = 2\\pi n_\\sigma\\,.\\ ] ] in terms of the total density @xmath48 and the polarization ( often called also magnetization ) @xmath49 , the expression immediately yields @xmath50 = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+\\zeta^2)n\\ ] ] for the total kinetic - energy density .",
    "the above definition of @xmath51 is completely general , but requires the diagonal of the second - order reduced density matrix , which is a fairly complex and often unmanageable object . in most cases ,",
    "however , a further approximation is taken by assuming that @xmath5 is a single - determinantal wave function . in practice",
    ", this means that one uses the hartree - fock approximation , therefore neglecting the effect of correlations in the elf , or one uses density - functional theory ( dft ) ( see below ) , and calculates the elf of the non - interacting auxiliary kohn - sham ( ks ) system .",
    "both possibilities are in principle unsatisfactory , but the experience has demonstrated that the results are usually unaffected despite a notable mathematical simplification ( see ref .  [ ] for the detailed steps ) . if @xmath5 is formed by the set of ks orbitals @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) within the spin - dft ( sdft ) , one finds @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the spin - density [ cf .",
    "( [ spindensity ] ) ] , @xmath57 is the kinetic - energy density given by @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the spin - resolved paramagnetic current density @xmath60 . \\label{current}\\ ] ] here we point out that most elf calculations refer to closed - shell molecules ( or finite systems in general ) in their ground state and in the absence of magnetic fields or the spin - orbit coupling . in those cases real wave functions can be assumed and the current term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : csigma1det ] ) is absent . in secs .",
    "[ subsection : mdd ] and [ subsection : vortex ] we note the importance of the current term , which is needed in the elf also during time - dependent processes.@xcite      the basis for the topological investigation of the elf was established by silvi and savin .",
    "@xcite the information contained in the elf is extracted with the help of some basic concepts borrowed from the theory of dynamical systems.@xcite the elf is a scalar continuous function bounded between 0 and 1 , and one should look at its gradient field , which in turn defines the set of attractors  roughly speaking the maxima of the elf .",
    "the important concept is then that of a _ basin _ of each attractor  the set of points for which that attractor is the @xmath61-limit . in chemistry , each basin is then identified either as a core basin ( it contains a nucleus ) , or as a valence basin .",
    "the latter ones are then classified according to the number of core basins that they have frontier with : if they have only one neighbor core , they are called monosynaptic ; if they have more than one ( disynaptic , trisynaptic etc . ) , they are _ bonds_.",
    "the absence of real nuclei in the 2d models makes this distinction not relevant .",
    "however , the division of space into localization basins is still pertinent : the basins give us information about the _ groups _ of electrons ; exchange of electrons is more unlikely between different basins than inside them . in 3d",
    "the attractors can then be single points in the absence of special symmetries , ring - shaped lines of attractors around a symmetry axis , or spheres around isolated atoms . in 2d , obviously , the topology simplifies and we can only find , besides point attractors , ring attractors for cylindrically symmetrical problems .",
    "we study the elf in 2d qds restricted to the _ xy _ plane .",
    "the system is described by an effective - mass @xmath2-electron hamiltonian @xmath62 + \\sum_{i < j}\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^ *",
    "|{\\mathbf r}_i-{\\mathbf r}_j| } , \\label{hamiltonian}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is the external vector potential ( in symmetric gauge ) of the homogeneous magnetic field @xmath64 perpendicular to the plane , @xmath65 is the external confining potential in the _ xy _ plane ( see below ) , and @xmath66 is the zeeman energy .",
    "we apply the conventional effective - mass approximation with the material parameters for gaas : the effective mass @xmath67 , the dielectric constant @xmath68 , and the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath69 .",
    "we solve the ground - state problem associated with the @xmath2-electron hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) by applying the sdft in the collinear - spin representation .",
    "the ks states , needed in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : csigma1det])-([current ] ) for computing the elf as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : elf ] ) , are solved from the ks equation @xmath70 \\varphi_{i\\sigma}(\\mathbf{r})=\\epsilon_{i\\sigma}\\varphi_{i\\sigma}(\\mathbf{r } ) , \\label{eq : kse}\\ ] ] where the ks potential @xmath71 is a sum of the external confining potential , the hartree potential , and the exchange - correlation potential given by @xmath72/\\delta n^\\sigma{({\\mathbf r})}$ ] . to approximate the exchange - correlation energy @xmath73 we use the local spin - density approximation ( lsda ) with a parametrization provided by attaccalite and co - workers .",
    "@xcite in qd systems the sdft scheme together with the lsda leads to good numerical accuracy in comparison with quantum monte carlo calculations , even in relatively high magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite we also point out that the local - vorticity approximation within the current - sdft  @xcite does not lead to a considerable improvement over the sdft results .",
    "@xcite in the numerical calculations we apply the real - space octopus code .",
    "first we examine the elf in parabolic qds at zero magnetic field ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "thus , we choose the external confining potential in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) as @xmath75 , where we set the confinement strength to @xmath76 a.u .",
    "@xmath77 mev .",
    "the system is a 2d harmonic oscillator with single - electron eigenenergies @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the radial and @xmath80 is the azimuthal quantum number .",
    "the corresponding shell structure has been experimentally well depicted in the addition energies of a double - barrier gaas qd .  @xcite",
    "further details in the measured addition energies resulting from the electron - electron interaction , such as hund s rule -type of behavior , have been theoretically verified in numerous studies employing , e.g. , sdft .",
    "@xcite    figure  [ shells ]        shows the elf ( red solid lines ) and the corresponding electron densities ( blue dashed lines ) when @xmath81 and @xmath82 . in qds",
    "these `` magic '' electron numbers correspond to the first closed - shell configurations when @xmath83 .",
    "the shell structure is visualized clearly by the elf .",
    "we note , however , that the local maxima in the elf do not directly correspond to the filled energy shells . instead",
    ", each peak can be associated with a doubly occupied single - electron state on the _ highest _ energy shell .",
    "this means that the probability of electron localization is highest close to the fermi level .",
    "for example , in a 12-electron qd shown in fig .",
    "[ shells](b ) , the highest energy shell has six electrons with @xmath84 , leading to distinctive peaks in the elf at the center ( corresponding to @xmath85 ) and at @xmath86 ( corresponding to @xmath87 ) .",
    "nevertheless , in this system the number of energy shells is equal to the number of extrema in the elf .",
    "as expected , the variation between the extrema decreases as a function of @xmath2 , since the highest shell becomes relatively less dominant . as seen in fig .",
    "[ shells ] , the shell structure is visible also in the electron density @xmath88 , but it is less clear than in the elf , especially at large electron numbers where the structure is barely visible .",
    "the elf instead provides an unambiguous visualization of the shell structure , which is well plausible from its physical nature discussed in secs .",
    "[ section : introduction ] and [ section : elf ] .",
    "the applicability of the elf to visualize pairs and bonds in molecules immediately suggests to use the elf for the 2d counterparts commonly known as qd molecules ( qdms ) .",
    "since the spin - qubit proposal of loss and devinzenzo  @xcite in 1998 , coupled qd systems have attracted wide interest both experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite , particularly in terms of charge and spin manipulation . following the standard qdm definition ,",
    "we write the external confining potential as @xmath89,\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is the number of potential minima located at @xmath91 .",
    "the case of @xmath92 , @xmath93 is equal to a single harmonic qd considered above . here",
    "we set @xmath94 and @xmath95 with @xmath96 a.u .",
    "this corresponds to a square - symmetric qdm with four minima .",
    "@xcite now , fig .",
    "[ qdm ]    , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 electrons , respectively .",
    "the total spin @xmath99 in all the cases . ]    shows the result of our sdft calculations for the total densities and elfs when @xmath100 ( a - b ) , @xmath101 ( c - d ) , and @xmath102 ( e - f ) , respectively .",
    "the ground - state total spin @xmath99 in all the cases shown .",
    "the densities of @xmath100 and @xmath101 qdms look very similar with four distinctive peaks , whereas the @xmath102 qdm shows more structure around the density maxima .",
    "however , the elfs of these qdms are very different from each other , having four maxima with one ( local ) minimum ( @xmath100 ) , five maxima with four minima ( @xmath101 ) , and four maxima with five minima ( @xmath102 ) . despite the fact that the concept of chemical bonding seems less meaningful in systems where the confining potential is fixed ( such as in 2d qd - systems ) , the central `` basin '' ( see sec .  [",
    "subsection : topology ] ) in fig .",
    "[ qdm](d ) , for example , is very informative : there is pronounced localization at the center , where the confining potential actually has a repulsive cusp .",
    "furthermore , this ground - state property is not at all visible in the bare electron density shown in fig .",
    "[ qdm](c ) .",
    "therefore , we find that the elf reveals features in the electronic structure of qdms which are absent in the electron density  a fact also demonstrated in 3d .",
    "next we perform our analysis of the 2d elf for non - zero external magnetic fields ( @xmath103 ) . as the first example we consider a maximum - density droplet ( mdd )  @xcite of a single parabolic qd .",
    "the mdd is a fully - polarized ( @xmath104 ) state , where the electrons have consecutive angular momenta from @xmath85 to @xmath105 .",
    "each electron is accompanied by a so - called _ pauli vortex _ which corresponds to a change of @xmath106 in the phase of the many - electron wave function .",
    "hence , the mdd state is a unique finite - size counterpart of the filling - factor @xmath107 quantum hall state of the uniform 2d electron gas .",
    "figures  [ mdd](a )     and @xmath108 quantum dots .",
    "( e , f ) paramagnetic current densities and the kinetic - energy densities of the maximum - density - droplet states , respectively . ]    and ( b ) show the electron density and the elf of the mdd state in a 12-electron parabolic qd at @xmath109 t. the mdd density has the well - known flat shape ,  @xcite whereas the elf is characterized by a flat interior and localization around the edge of the qd .",
    "intersections of the density and the elf are plotted in figs .",
    "[ mdd](c - d ) ( red dashed lines ) , together with the results for 6 and 20-electron qds at @xmath110 t and @xmath111 t , respectively .",
    "interestingly , the values of the elf are very close to @xmath37 in the interior of the mdds .",
    "thus , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : elf ] ) we find @xmath112 in this regime , i.e. , the kinetic - energy density of the uniform 2d electron gas .",
    "the result suggests that the localization of electrons and vortices compensate each other , which is well plausible considering the @xmath107 character of the mdd state .",
    "we may thus expect that at higher magnetic fields , corresponding to the fractional quantum - hall regime ( @xmath113 ) , elf values below @xmath37 can be found at positions of high vorticity .",
    "figure  [ mdd](d ) shows also the elf of the @xmath108 qd calculated without the current - density term @xmath114 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : csigma1det ] ) .",
    "that curve equals to the full elf at @xmath115 where the current density is zero , but decays exponentially at larger @xmath116 .",
    "obviously , that result does not capture the correct behavior of the mdd state .",
    "the dramatic difference demonstrates the importance of the current - density dependence in the elf expression , already at relatively moderate magnetic fields . in fig .",
    "[ mdd](e ) we plot @xmath114 which increases linearly due to the successive increase in the angular momenta of the ks states in the mdd ( see above ) .",
    "increasing the magnetic field above the mdd limit at @xmath107 , which , as seen above , corresponds to elf=@xmath37 , leads to localization of vortices .",
    "depending on the qd geometry , the vortices may form clusters  @xcite or merge together yielding multiple phase quantization .",
    "@xcite in fig .  [ singlevortex ]",
    "t. the lower panel shows middle intersections of the figures in the upper panel . ]",
    "we show the electron density and the elf of a single - vortex solution in a six - electron parabolic qd at @xmath117 t. in this case the vortex is localized at the center and directly visible as a hole in the density .",
    "as expected , the elf shows a similar strucure .",
    "the elf has a bump with a value @xmath118 , located between the center and the edge of the qd .",
    "this region can be interpreted to have , on the average , a local balance between electrons and ( pauli-)vortices , and it separates the localized vortex ( elf@xmath119 ) from the edge having high electron localization ( elf@xmath120 ) .    increasing the magnetic field further leads to the formation of more vortices .",

    "[ ] and [ ] .",
    "again , the vortices are seen as zeros in the elf , whereas the density is _ not _ exactly zero at these positions . actually , the numerically exact density at the vortices is even further above zero than the sdft density due to the multiconfigurational nature of the many - electron wave function .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , the elf=@xmath124 result at the vortex positions is plausible , reflecting again the difference between the probable _ location _ ( density ) and the _ localization _ ( elf ) of the electrons as discussed in sec .",
    "[ section : introduction ] . along the edge of the qd , the elf in fig .",
    "[ rectavortex](b ) shows six clear peaks with maximum values close to one , separated by local minima where elf@xmath118 .",
    "thus , in this qd the elf reveals the wigner crystallization , i.e. , localization of electrons around their classical positions which are determined by the geometry of the system .",
    "this effect is considerably less pronounced in the electron density shown in fig .  [",
    "rectavortex](a ) .",
    "the electronic structure of a many - electron system is fully characterized by its many - body wave function . in order to acquire an intuitive visual understanding of the system , however , we must look at simpler objects  integrated magnitudes such as the electronic density , which lives in a lower dimensional space .",
    "unfortunately , the density does not fully reveal all the intricacies of the electronic structure , even if we know that it contains all the information .    in the past",
    ", the elf has proven to be a useful companion to the density in the task of providing us with insightful intuition on the electronic structure of molecules . in this work",
    "we have defined the elf in 2d , and we have demonstrated that its visualization , in addition to that of the density , helps to understand the electronic structure of 2d systems such as semiconductor quantum dots .",
    "we have shown the usefulness of the elf to visualize the shell structure , as well as the bond - like features in coupled systems .",
    "in particular , we have found that in magnetic fields the elf can be used as a measure of vorticity , revealing the local relation between the localization of electrons and vortices in the system . in this context , we have shown that the current - dependent term , which has been neglected in previous 3d studies , has a major contribution to the elf in magnetic fields .",
