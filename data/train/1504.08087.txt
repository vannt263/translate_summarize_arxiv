    "in classical mechanics , the influence of a thermal environment ( bath ) on a brownian particle ( subsystem ) is well described by the langevin dynamics within the newtonian framework .",
    "the subsystem thermalization is obtained from the balance of two forces ( friction and stochastic ) which generate irreversible energy exchanges between the two systems .",
    "to search for the corresponding description in quantum mechanics is a crucial issue both for the understanding of quantum fundamentals and in many branches of applied physics ( where the quantum systems can never be isolated ) , such as in quantum diffusion and transport @xcite , quantum optics @xcite , heavy ion scattering @xcite , quantum computers and devices @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the langevin dynamics  or more generally energy dissipation  can not be introduced easily in the common quantum formalism , as no direct canonical quantization of a hamiltonian can describe irreversible phenomena @xcite .",

    "the sle has also been derived within many other frameworks and non - standard quantization procedures to describe either pure dissipation @xcite or the case of a brownian motion @xcite .",
    "the sle includes a thermal fluctuation term @xmath7 and a dissipative term under its hydrodynamic formulation @xcite @xmath8 where the phase @xmath2 is chosen according to a prescription which will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ polarpres ] . even though the dissipative term is nonlinearly ( logarithmically ) dependent on the wave function , it still corresponds to a linear ohmic friction ( i.e.  proportional to the particle velocity ) .",
    "a nonlinear friction can be obtained by extending kostin derivation to a nonlinear coupling @xcite .",
    "the sle exhibits interesting properties : unitarity is preserved at all times @xcite , the uncertainty principle is always satisfied @xcite and the superposition principle is violated due to the nonlinearities ( which might not be a problem per se for dissipative equations @xcite ) .",
    "thanks to its straightforward formulation  in principle only two  classical \" parameters need to be known : the friction coefficient @xmath1 and the bath temperature @xmath9  and its numerical simplicity , the sle can be considered as a solid candidate for effective description of open quantum systems hardly accessible to quantum master equations @xcite .",
    "indeed , in a number of complex applications , defining the bath / interaction hamiltonian and calculating the lindblad operators without too many approximations is rather complicated , and some effective approaches  possibly of the langevin type ",
    "are unavoidable @xcite . because there is no established connection between the sle and the standard quantum master equations , the sle is different from the stochastic schrdinger equation ( sse ) developed to mock the evolutions given by the quantum master equations @xcite . as stochastic equations based on pure state evolutions",
    ", they nevertheless share the same philosophy to perform an average over a large ensemble of initially identical subsystems to recover the statistical mixed state describing the subsystem .",
    "the expectation value of an observable operator @xmath10 is then given by @xmath11 where the pure state @xmath12 is given by the @xmath13 realization of the stochastic evolution .",
    "the numerical costs remain quite reasonable in comparison to the common density matrix approach which is highly expensive when the hilbert space associated to the subsystem is large . + before considering any actual application to phenomenology , some questions and issues remain to be explored about the solutions of the sle and its thermal relaxation .    the study of its solutions without stochastic term has been carried out in many specific cases , either analytically @xcite or numerically @xcite . along these analysis",
    ", it has been advocated that the stationary eigenstates of @xmath4 are also stationary states of the equation @xcite .",
    "this behavior is in contradiction with what is expected from damped quantum systems @xcite . as an answer to this expectation",
    ", we will first show in sec .",
    "[ polarpres ] how a proper application of the madelung / polar transformation of the wave function results in the damping of these states .",
    "the purely dissipative sle has already been applied in quantum chemistry @xcite and heavy ion scattering @xcite .",
    "however very few studies including the stochastic term have been carried out and these are moreover mere comparisons with the solutions of the hle .",
    "kostin @xcite first observed that for a free particle plane wave , the sle and hle lead to the same solution .",
    "then , messer @xcite studied the evolution of a gaussian wave packet in the free and harmonic cases . in the free case , he showed that the evolution differs from the hle solution , highlighting that the sle and hle are not strictly equivalent . in his calculation , messer used a white noise for the stochastic force @xmath3  which is questionable  and assumed that the sle naturally leads to the thermal equilibrium predicted by statistical mechanics ( the gibbs state ) .",
    "the latter is characterized by a boltzmann distribution of the uncoupled subsystem energy states @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath17 the population ( or  weight \" ) of the eigenstate of energy @xmath18 , and is generally expected at the weak coupling limit for a quantum subsystem in interaction with a heat bath @xcite .",
    "the so - called _ weak coupling limit _ or brownian hierarchy is achieved when the relaxation time of the subsystem ( @xmath19 ) is much larger than its natural period of oscillation and than the typical correlation time @xmath20 of the microscopic interactions between the bath components and the subsystem . to our knowledge",
    "it has never been proven or tested that the sle actually admits such an asymptotic distribution in a dynamical manner .",
    "the main contribution of the present work is precisely to study the thermal relaxation given by the sle with different 1d subsystems using either a white or a colored noise and thus to test messer s assumption as a byproduct . to this end , in section [ quantnoise ] , we discuss different possible choices for the stochastic force @xmath3 ( which will be assumed to be a c - number ) . in section [ section3harmo ] , we study the equilibration given by the sle with a 1d harmonic potential @xmath21 .",
    "to do so , we first show analytically that the sle brings a gaussian wave packet to the gibbs state if one uses a specific white noise .",
    "we generalize this result to other initial states through the numerical resolution of the sle with the crank - nicolson scheme .",
    "similarly , we then explore the equilibration resulting from a colored noise and demonstrate that it leads to the correct equilibration in the weak coupling limit . in section [ section4linear ] ,",
    "we extend the numerical simulations to a linear potential @xmath22 to study the equilibration given by the sle within a non - harmonic situation .    though the thermal equilibrium of statistical mechanics is only expected at the weak coupling limit ( @xmath23 ) , where @xmath24 is the characteristic frequency associated to the potential @xmath25 for the harmonic potential and @xmath26{\\frac{k_l^2}{m \\hbar}}$ ] for the linear potential . ] , the intermediate ( @xmath27 ) and strongly coupled regimes ( @xmath28 ) are also investigated .",
    "although we perform the numerical simulations with the dimensionless sle for simplicity ",
    "i.e. with natural units @xmath29 and dimensionless variables @xmath30 , @xmath31 ,  , @xmath31 , @xmath1 , @xmath32 and @xmath4 can be obtained by multiplying our dimensionless values respectively by @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath24 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath24 is specific to each type of potential . ]  the analysis shows that the important dimensionless ratios governing the physics are @xmath37 and @xmath38 for both potentials . in the main part of the text , it is then assumed , for the purpose of compactness , that @xmath1 and @xmath9 are respectively measured in units of @xmath24 and @xmath39  and thus correspond to these ratios  , while times are measured in units of @xmath40 and energies in units of @xmath41 . for all analytical calculations , we stick however to the international system of units , for the sake of clarity .    along this work , we will extract some effective temperature @xmath42 reached by the subsystem from the asymptotic weights @xmath43 , mostly by fitting a boltzmann distribution @xmath44 to this equilibrium distribution . in some specific situations we will observe that @xmath42 differs from the bath temperature @xmath9 ( which is concretely defined as the temperature entering the noise correlation )",
    "; it is precisely one of the main goals of our study to identify under which conditions such a departure happens .",
    "though theoretically the fluctuation and dissipation aspects can not be dissociated , it appears that in some specific studies only the damping is considered @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the dissipative part of the sle ( [ sleq ] ) suffers from ambiguities and some prescription is required to obtain an unambiguous definition .",
    "its main non - linear ingredient is the real phase @xmath45 , defined by the wave function decomposition @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the real amplitude .",
    "@xmath45 is indeterminate at the wave function nodes and , in general , multivalued ( defined modulo @xmath48 ) .    in the literature",
    "@xcite , a common prescription adopted for real @xmath49 is to require the phase @xmath50 to be zero ( and thus continuous at the nodes of @xmath49 ) while @xmath51 is taken as a real  _ positive or negative _  function .",
    "this prescription has led to the conclusion that the stationary eigenstates of @xmath4 are also stationary states of the sle , as the dissipation term identically vanishes . for the sake of describing time - dependent situations , a corresponding prescription",
    "has however to be adopted for any complex @xmath49 as well .",
    "it is easily seen that such an analytical continuation unavoidably has one branch cut in each half complex - plane , both of them starting from the origin .",
    "taking for instance those branch cuts along the imaginary axis corresponds to @xmath52 with finite values of the friction potential in the sle and then finite damping .",
    "therefore , an infinitesimal modification of @xmath49 ( associated to a slight deviation from real axis to complex plane ) leads to a large variation of the associated damping of the quantum state , which is the sign of an ill - defined model .",
    "we propose to use instead the  polar \" or  madelung \" prescription , where one defines @xmath47 in eq .",

    "one of the possible signatures of the qgp is the melting of all hadrons made of @xmath305 and @xmath306 quark - antiquark pairs  the so - called _ quarkonia _ otherwise quite robust in less extreme conditions  resulting in a suppression of their production as compared to a situation were no qgp would have been formed .",
    "such a mechanism was postulated in 1986 by matsui and satz  @xcite and was indeed observed later on , but the analysis is however not quite conclusive ( see  @xcite for a recent review ) , one of the main reason , on the theory side , being that the dynamics of those quantum object is not properly taken into account in most models . it is the purpose of this section to investigate whether the sle could be appropriate to deal with such a system .",
    "quarkonia can be described in non - relativistic quantum mechanics through phenomenological potentials , the most simple of them being the cornell potential ( see  @xcite and references therein ) : @xmath307 where @xmath308 is the distance between the quark and the antiquark , @xmath309 and @xmath310 1 gev / fm is the string tension .",

    "[ fig : asymlinpncol ] reveals that states up to the 3rd excited one ( @xmath327 should be correctly described by the sle , which represents most of the charmonia spectroscopy .",
    "all together , we conclude that the sle is a relevant approach to study the dynamics of quarkonia formation in urhic and probe more accurately the qgp formed in these collisions .",
    "for the purpose of finding an effective formalism suitable to phenomenological applications of open quantum systems , we have focused on the schrdinger  langevin equation ( [ sleq ] ) .",
    "its nonlinear friction term is commonly believed to maintain the stationarity of the excited states of the uncoupled hamiltonian @xmath4 .",
    "we have shown in sec .",
    "[ polarpres ] that the madelung / polar transformation of the wave function leads to a nonzero damping for these states . in this way",
    ", we have reconciled the sle with the intuitive expectation that the dissipation process should act on any state in order to bring the subsystem to its ground state .",
    "we have then focused on the question of the thermal relaxation dynamics given by the sle for two different potentials and with two different noise operators , taken as c - numbers : the white noise ( [ qnrk ] )  which has been derived by senitzky @xcite and subtracted by its term of ground state fluctuations  and the colored noise ( [ qnfordnormprod ] ) derived by ford , kac and mazur @xcite .",
    "we first considered the case of a harmonic potential for which most of the results regarding asymptotic states and distributions could be established analytically for both kind of noises .",
    "when the subsystem undergoes a white noise , the sle has demonstrated its ability to bring any initial state to the thermal equilibrium of statistical mechanics ( i.e.  boltzmann distributions of the uncoupled subsystem energy states ) , irrespective of the coupling strength and of the bath temperature  confirming the assumption made by messer @xcite  although such equilibration is generally expected only in the weak coupling limit ( as explained in the introduction ) . for a colored noise , exact thermalization toward the boltzmann distribution",
    "was established only in the large temperature regime ( @xmath328 ) or in the so - called weak coupling regime ( @xmath329 ) where the brownian hierarchy is satisfied . outside of these regimes",
    ", it has been shown that most of the deviations with respect to the boltzmann distribution @xmath330 could be accommodated by introducing some effective temperature @xmath42 corresponding to the subsystem internal equilibration . the disagreements between @xmath42 and the bath temperature @xmath9 ( input of the noise ) observed at low temperatures or for large friction coefficient @xmath1 can be attributed to the breaking of the brownian hierarchy .",
    "the study for the case of a subsystem submitted to a linear potential was performed thanks to numerical investigations . while a rather clean equilibration was found in the high temperature regime , genuine non - boltzmannian behaviors for higher excited states ( which can not be accommodated by a simple change of the temperature @xmath331 ) and stronger friction coefficient dependences",
    "have been observed at low and medium temperatures for both kind of noises .",
    "concentrating on a smaller subset of low lying eigenstates , the colored noise has nevertheless led to better results in the sense of statistical mechanics , confirming its more universal nature .",
    "in particular , the effective temperature @xmath42 was found to follow similar behavior as the one introduced in the harmonic potential case and to converge toward @xmath9 in the weak coupling regime .",
    "we thus conclude that the colored noise should be used preferentially , especially at low temperatures ( under the condition that the brownian hierarchy is preserved ) .",
    "the sle and the quasiclassical langevin equation seem therefore to share a common difficulty in the description of dissipative evolutions outside the nearly harmonic and free potential cases @xcite and especially outside the classical high temperature limit @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , further analyses  such as in quantum tunneling @xcite  would be required to establish a common behavior .",
    "if one focuses on applications where only the lower states are considered , a phenomenological model could be to rectify the observed differences between @xmath42 and @xmath9 by choosing an effective heat - bath temperature @xmath295 such as to reach the desired subsystem temperature @xmath138 .",
    "it just requires the proper knowledge of the @xmath42(@xmath9 ) function as displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig : hcolteffvst ] ,  [ fig : teffvst ] and [ fig : colorlintsubtbath ] .",
    "though one has to adapt this rescaling to each situation , the sle can thus be considered , in a good approximation , as a possible effective alternative to quantum master equations and sse for phenomenology of complex quantum systems ( such as ions quantum transport , thermalization of quarkonia in a quark - gluon plasma , of nucleons in a nucleus ,  ) .",
    "dealing with the full hierarchy of states in the general case would possibly require either the use of the colored noise correlation ( [ qnford ] ) , of a q - number noise operator or of a more refined quantum treatment of the subsystem interactions with the heat bath .",
    "establishing an einstein relation specific to the sle would also be an interesting perspective for this field .",
    "it should be noted that our analysis relies on the hypothesis that the asymptotic distribution of subsystem - eigenstates weights @xmath17 must be boltzmannian whatever the potential and the coupling strength to the rest of the system ( the heat bath ) . to our knowledge , such an assumption has not been universally established from fundamental principles ( i.e.  starting from the distribution of the full - system eigenstates and tracing out the heat - bath degrees of freedom ) and should be considered more thoroughly in future studies as it could partially alter our conclusions .",

    "<S> the schrdinger  langevin equation ( sle ) is considered as an effective open quantum system formalism suitable for phenomenological applications involving a quantum subsystem interacting with a thermal bath . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on two open issues relative to its solutions : the stationarity of the excited states of the non - interacting subsystem when one considers the dissipation only and the thermal relaxation toward asymptotic distributions with the additional stochastic term . </S>",
    "<S> we first show that a proper application of the madelung / polar transformation of the wave function leads to a non zero damping of the excited states of the quantum subsystem . </S>",
    "<S> we then study analytically and numerically the sle ability to bring a quantum subsystem to the thermal equilibrium of statistical mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> to do so , concepts about statistical mixed states and quantum noises are discussed and a detailed analysis is carried with two kinds of noise and potential . we show that within our assumptions the use of the sle as an effective open quantum system formalism is possible and discuss some of its limitations .    </S>",
