    "the extraction of the ground - state parameters from the operator product expansion ( ope ) series for a relevant correlator is a cumbersome procedure : even if several terms of the ope for the correlator are known precisely , the numerical procedures of the method of dispersive sum rules @xcite can not determine the true exact value of the bound - state parameter . instead , the method should provide the band of values such the true hadron parameter has a flat probability distribution within this band @xcite .",
    "this band is a systematic , or intrinsic , sum - rule uncertainty .",
    "the method of sum rules in qcd contains a set of prescriptions ( see e.g.  @xcite ) which are believed to provide such a systematic error . in qcd this , however , always remains a conjecture  it is impossible to prove that the range provided by the standard sum - rule procedures indeed contains the actual value of the bound - state parameter .",
    "the only possibility to acquire an unbiased judgement of the reliability of the error estimates in sum rules is to apply the method to a problem where the parameters of the theory may be fixed and the corresponding parameters of the ground state may be calculated independently and exactly .",
    "presently , only quantum - mechanical potential models provide such a possibility .    a simple harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) potential model @xcite possesses the essential features of qcd  confinement and asymptotic freedom @xcite  and has the following advantages : ( i ) the bound - state parameters ( masses , wave functions , form factors ) are known precisely ; ( ii ) direct analogues of the qcd correlators may be calculated exactly . ( for a discussion of many aspects of sum rules in quantum mechanics we refer to @xcite ) .",
    "making use of this model , we have already studied the extraction of ground - state parameters from different types of correlators : namely , the ground - state decay constant from two - point vacuum - to - vacuum correlator @xcite , the form factor from three - point vacuum - to - vacuum correlator @xcite , and form factor from vacuum - to - hadron correlator @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated that the standard adopted procedures for obtaining the systematic errors do not work properly : for all types of correlators the true known value of the bound - state parameter was shown to lie outside the band obtained according to the standard criteria .",
    "these results give a solid ground to claim that also in qcd the actual accuracy of the method turns out to be much worse than the accuracy expected on the basis of the standard criteria applied .",
    "thus , our results reported in @xcite mainly contained cautious messages concerning the application of sum rules to hadron properties .",
    "however , understanding the problem is the necessary first step in solving the problem .",
    "we have realized that the main origin of this failure of the method lies in an over - simplified model for hadron contnuum which is described as a perturbative contribution above a constant borel - parameter independent effective continuum threshold .",
    "we have introduced the notion of the _ exact _ effective continuum threshold , which corresponds to the true bound - state parameters : in a ho model the true hadron parameters  decay constant and form factor  are known and the exact effective continuum thresholds for different correlators may be calculated .",
    "we have demonstrated that the exact effective continuum threhsold ( i ) is not a universal quantity and depends on the correlator considered ( i.e. it is in general different for two - point and three - point vacuum - to - vacuum correlators ) , and ( ii ) depends on the borel parameter and , for the form - factor case , also on the momentum - transfer .",
    "moreover , we have shown that the `` borel stability criterium '' combined with the assumption of a borel - parameter independent effective continuum threshold leads to the extraction of the wrong bound - state parameters .    in view of these results",
    "a natural question arises : it is possible to formulate modified procedures which would improve the actual accuracy of hadron parameters extracted from sum rules , or the method is only suitable for obtaining numerical estimates with uncontrollable errors which may amount to 20 - 30% ?",
    "we believe the answer to the first part of this question is positive .    in a recent paper @xcite we proposed a new algorithm for extracting the parameters of the ground state .",
    "the simple idea of @xcite is to relax the standard assumption of a borel - parameter independent effective continuum threshold , and allow for a borel - parameter dependent quantity . in @xcite we have illustrated the way the procedure works for the extraction of the form factor from three - point vacuum - to - vacuum correlator .    in the present paper",
    "we develop this idea and provide details of its application to the extraction of hadron parameters from dispersive sum rules .",
    "we present for the first time the application of the new algorithm to the two - point correlator and present a detailed analysis of the extraction of the form factor from three - point correlator .",
    "the new algorithm is shown to lead to a significant improvement of the actual accuracy of the extracted bound - state parameters . even though the full control over the systematic uncertainties , in the strict mathematical sense , is still not feasible ( and presumably can not be achieved in principle ) , our findings suggest that it may be possible to shed light on the actual accuracy of the method of sum - rules in qcd .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sect : ho ] recalls the results for bound states in the ho model ; section [ sect : pi ] gives the ope for the polarization operator .",
    "section [ sect : gamma ] presents detailed results for the vertex function and the corresponding ope .",
    "sum rules for the decay constant and the form factor are given in section [ sect : sr ] .",
    "section [ sect : numerics ] provides our numerical results .",
    "finally , section [ sect : conclusions ] presents our concluding remarks .",

    "the deviation of the energy from @xmath26 at finite values of @xmath23 measures the `` contamination '' of the correlator by the excited states .",
    "the ground - state contribution to the correlator has a simple form : @xmath27 the ope series is the expansion of @xmath17 at small euclidean time @xmath23 : @xmath28 for @xmath17 this expansion is equivalent to the expansion in powers of the interaction @xmath29 .",
    "the first term in ( [ piope ] ) does not depend on the interaction and describes the free propagation of the constituents .",
    "@xmath30 may be written as the spectral integral @xcite @xmath31 with @xmath32 the known spectral density of the one - loop two - point feynman diagram of the nonrelativistic field theory @xcite .",
    "the rest of the series represents power corrections , which may be obtained just as the difference between the exact correlator and the free - propagation term : @xmath33",
    "the basic quantity for the extraction of the form factor in the method of dispersive sum rules is the correlator of three currents @xcite .",

    ", we consider the vertex function for equal times @xmath46 , which reads @xmath47 the correlator @xmath48 is a function of two dimensionless variables @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",

    "( [ fg ] ) , versus the momentum transfer @xmath58 .",
    "the dots , squares and diamonds correspond , respectively , to the results obtained using a constant ( [ constant ] ) , linear ( [ linear ] ) and quadratic ( [ quadratic ] ) approximation for the @xmath23-dependence of @xmath56.,width=396 ]    for a @xmath23-independent approximation ( [ constant ] ) , the minimization of @xmath59 ( [ chisq ] ) leads to @xmath60 for which the dual energy @xmath61 differs from @xmath26 by less than @xmath62 and the dual form factor @xmath63 turns out to be practically @xmath23-independent in the whole fiducial range .",
    "such a stability , usually referred to as the borel stability , is often ( erroneously ) claimed to be the way to control the accuracy of the extracted form factor . from fig .",
    "[ plot:5 ] it is clear , however , that the actual error of the extracted form factor turns out to be much larger than the variation of the form factor in the fiducial range of @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , the t - independent ansatz is applicable only for not very large @xmath58 : for @xmath64 it fails to reproduce the ground - state energy in the fiducial range .",
    "allowing for a linear ansatz ( [ linear ] ) for @xmath56 extends the range of the momentum transfers where the form factor can be extracted from the sum rule with a reasonable accuracy .",
    "note that the _ exact _ effective continuum threshold of the ho model can be well approximated by a linear function of @xmath23 in the whole fiducial range , see fig .",
    "[ plot:3](a ) .",
    "nevertheless , this does not mean that the minimization of ( [ chisq ] ) finds the _ exact _ effective continuum threshold and leads to the _ exact _ form factor : the deviation of the extracted form factor from the exact one amounts to a few percent for @xmath65 and increases dramatically for @xmath66 , see fig .",
    "[ plot:6 ] . the dramatic increase of the error at @xmath67",
    "is directly related to the fact that the contribution of the ground state to the correlator decreases rapidly with @xmath58 in the given @xmath23-window @xmath68 ( see fig .  [ plot:1 ] ) .",
    "let us emphasize that the actual error of the extracted form factor turns out to be much larger than the variation of the form factor in the window , see fig .",
    "[ plot:5 ] .",
    "one may try to go further and to consider the quadratic ansatz ( [ quadratic ] ) . from fig .",
    "[ plot:6 ] it is clear that the quadratic ansatz leads to certain instabilities in the extracted value of the form factor and does not , in general , improve the actual accuracy of the form factor extraction .",
    "this is not strange : such a behaviour just reflects the fact that the sum - rule extraction of the ground - state parameters can be performed only with a limited accuracy , which has been known since the initial svz paper @xcite .",
    "it should be therefore clear that there is no way to get further improvement in the accuracy of the extracted form factor by increasing the degree of the polynomial approximation of @xmath56 .",
    "nevertheless , we have seen a clear improvement in the outcome of the extraction procedure as one goes beyond the assumption of a @xmath23-independent effective continuum threshold : first , the actual accuracy turns out to be ( much ) better ; second , the @xmath23-dependent ansatz allows one to extract the form factor in a broader range of the momentum transfer .",
    "the crucial question for the application of sum rules to the bound - state form factors is how to understand the actual accuracy of the ground - state parameter extracted from the sum rule .",
    "\\(i ) obviously , the borel stability does not guarantee the good extraction of the ground - state parameter and the variation of the extracted ground - state parameter in the window does not provide a realistic error estimate .",
    "\\(ii ) it should be understood that even a very accurate reproduction of the ground - state energy in the window does not lead to equivalently accurate extraction of the ground - state parameters .",
    "this is rather unpleasant since the deviation of the dual energy from the known ground - state energy is the only visible characteristic which can be controlled in the realistic cases .",
    "what really matters for the extraction of the bound - state parameters is the deviation of the fitted effective threshold from the exact effective threshold which , however , in the realistic cases remains unknown .    in the ho model ,",
    "a realistic error estimate of the accuracy in a wide range of values of @xmath58 may be obtained by comparing to each other the form factor values extracted by assuming the linear and quadratic anstze for the effective continuum threshold ( [ linear ] ) and ( [ quadratic ] ) . whether this feature persists in qcd",
    "is an interesting and important issue to be addressed in the future .",
    "we studied the extraction of the ground - state form factor from the vacuum - to - vacuum correlator in the exactly solvable harmonic - oscillator model applying the standard procedures of the method of qcd sum rules .",
    "let us summarize the main messages of our analysis :    * the knowledge of the correlator in a limited range of relatively small euclidean times @xmath23 ( that is , large borel masses ) is not sufficient for the determination of the ground - state parameters .",
    "in addition to the ope for the relevant correlator , one needs an independent criterion for fixing the effective continuum threshold . * assuming a @xmath23-independent ( i.e. , a borel - parameter independent ) effective continuum threshold , the error of the extracted form factor @xmath69 turns out to be typically much larger than ( i ) the error of the description of the exact correlator @xmath48 by the truncated ope @xmath70 and ( ii ) the variation of @xmath69 in the fiducial range of @xmath23 ( i.e. , the borel window ) . as the result",
    ", the actual value of the hadron form factor may lie far outside the range covered by the sum - rule estimate @xmath69 within the borel window of @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the variation of the hadron form factor ( as well as other hadron parameters ) within the borel window can not be used as an estimate of its systematic error .",
    "the latter point is of particular relevance for the practical applications of sum rules in qcd , since the borel stability is usually ( erroneously ) believed to control the accuracy and the reliability of the extracted ground - state parameter .",
    "* in the cases where the ground - state mass is known ( e.g. , experimentally measured ) , the actual accuracy of the sum - rule analysis may be considerably improved by allowing for a @xmath23-dependent effective continuum threshold and finding its parameters by minimizing the deviation of the energy of the dual correlator from the known value of the ground - state energy , eq .",
    "( [ chisq ] ) .",
    "+ in the ho model , this procedure was shown to yield clear improvements in the extracted values of the decay constant and the form factor .",
    "+ moreover , in the ho model the deviation between the hadron parameter values obtained by using different anstze for @xmath71 gives _ de facto _ a realistic error estimate .",
    "this was observed for both the decay constant and the form factor .",
    "unfortunately , it remains impossible to construct the band of values which may be _ proven _ to contain the actual form factor . in this sense , the method of sum rules is not able to provide _ rigorous _ error estimates .",
    "nevertheless , the application of the new procedures formulated in this paper to hadron form factors in qcd seems very promising with respect to improving the _ actual _ accuracy of the method .",
