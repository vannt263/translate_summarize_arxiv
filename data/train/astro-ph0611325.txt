    "nonthermal hard x - ray ( hxr ) emission was predicted in the seventies in clusters of galaxies showing extended radio regions , radio halos or relics , since the same radio synchrotron electrons can interact with the cmb photons to give inverse compton ( ic ) x - ray radiation ( perola & reinhardt 1972 ; rephaeli 1979 ) .",
    "several attempts to detect hard tails in the spectrum of a few clusters of galaxies were performed with various experiments ( bazzano 1984,90 ; rephaeli , gruber & rothschild 1987 ; rephaeli & gruber 1988 ; rephaeli , ulmer & gruber 1994 ) that reported only upper limits to the flux . a significant breakthrough in the measurement of hxr emission was obtained thanks to the improved sensitivity and wide spectral capabilities of the and rossi x - ray timing explorer ( ) satellities . as pointed out by petrosian ( 2003 ) ,",
    "the discovery of hxr radiation has led to a remarkable increase of the theoretical investigations regarding the possible acceleration mechanisms and origin of the relativistic electrons responsible for the emission , although the presence of phenomena in the intracluster medium ( icm ) of some clusters was established decades ago ( willson 1970 ) .",
    "nonthermal hxr radiation was detected in excess of the thermal emission in the coma cluster by a first observation ( fusco - femiano 1999 ) using the phoswich detection system ( pds ) and confirmed by a second independent observation with a time interval of about 3 yr ( fusco - femiano 2004 ; thereafter ff04 ) .",
    "the presence of a second component in the x - ray spectrum of the cluster has been reported also by two observations ( rephaeli , gruber & blanco 1999 ; rephaeli & gruber 2002 ) .",
    "a2256 is the second cluster where a excess has been measured by two observations ( fusco - femiano 2000 ; fusco - femiano 2005 ) and by ( rephaeli & gruber 2003 ) . at a lower confidence level , with respect to coma and a2256 ,",
    "hxr radiation has been detected by in a754 ( fusco - femiano 2003 ) .",
    "an upper limit to the flux has been reported in a3667 ( fusco - femiano 2001 ) , a119 ( fusco - femiano 2003 ) and a2163 ( feretti 2001 ) .",
    "for the last cluster a observation shows instead the presence of a hxr excess ( rephaeli , gruber , & arieli 2006 ) .",
    "reports also some evidence of emission by the bullet cluster ( petrosian , madejski , & luli 2006 ) .",
    "the pds spectra of all the observations were extracted using the xas version 2.1 package ( chiappetti & dal fiume 1997 ) specifically created to handle the pds peculiarities . however , a pds data analysis performed with a different software package ( saxdas ) does not report evidence for the presence of a hard tail in spectrum of the coma cluster ( rossetti & molendi 2004 ; thereafter rm04 ) .    to solve this contradiction we reanalyzed the pds data of the two observations using the saxdas 2.0.2 package and in this letter we present our results and conclusions . in sect .",
    "2 we show the results of this analysis that are compared with those reported in ff04 using the xas package and we examine the possible systematic errors investigated by rm04 and nevalainen ( 2004 , thereafter ne04 ) . in sec . 3",
    "we discuss the reasons that have led to controversial results using different software packages .",
    "finally , sect .",
    "4 is devoted to the conclusions regarding the presence of a hard tail in the spectrum of the coma cluster .    throughout this letter",
    "we assume a @xmath1cdm cosmology with @xmath2 = 70  km  s@xmath3  mpc@xmath3  @xmath4 , @xmath5 = 0.3 and @xmath6 = 0.7 .",
    "an angular distance of @xmath7 corresponds to 29.0 kpc ( @xmath8 = 0.0232 ) .",
    "quoted confidence intervals are at @xmath9 level , if not otherwise specified .",
    "the coma cluster was observed for the first time by the pds instrument ( frontera 1997 ) in december 1997 for @xmath1091 ks and re - observed in december 2000 for @xmath10300 ks .",
    "the pointing coordinates of are at j(2000 ) : @xmath11 ; @xmath12 . to resolve the discrepancy between the results shown by ff04 and rm04 regarding the presence of a component in the hxr coma spectrum",
    ", we have re - analyzed the pds data with the saxdas package used by rm04 .",
    "however , we start by reporting the procedure used in the xas analysis and the main results obtained .",
    "more details can be found in ff04 .",
    "the pds data used in the xas analysis were selected by a first automatic procedure followed by a visual check in order to eliminate all the remaining spikes that can affect significantly the analysis results .",
    "the effective exposure times in the two pds observations were 44.5 ks and 122.2 ks , respectively ( thereafter obs1 and obs2 ) . since the source is rather faint in the pds band ( @xmath105 mcrab in 15100 kev )",
    "a careful check of the background subtraction was performed , making use of the default rocking law of the two pds collimators that samples on/+off , on/off fields for each collimator with a dwell time of 96 sec ( frontera 1997 ) .",
    "when one collimator is pointing on source , the other collimator is pointing toward one of the two off positions .",
    "initially , we used the standard procedure to obtain pds spectra ( dal  fiume 1997 ) ; this procedure consists of extracting one accumulated spectrum for each unit for each collimator position .",
    "we then checked the two independently accumulated background spectra in the two different + /off sky directions , offset by @xmath13 with respect to the on - axis pointing direction ( + off pointing : @xmath14 ; @xmath15 off pointing : @xmath16 ; @xmath17 ) .",
    "the comparison between the two accumulated backgrounds ( difference between the + off and off count rate spectra ) showed that for obs1 the difference was compatible with zero ( @xmath18 for a background level of @xmath19 in 15100 kev ) , while for the longer , more sensitive obs2 , there was an excess of @xmath20 ( background @xmath21 ) 20% variation in the pds background is due to the orbital decay : the lower orbit for obs2 increased the shielding to ambient particles , therefore lowering the diffuse background . ] .",
    "as reported in ff04 , a careful check of possible variable sources in the pds offset fields led the attention to the bl  lac source 1es  1255 + 244 , present in the + off field , that was observed by on may 1998 in the framework of a spectral survey of bl  lacs by beckmann ( 2002 ) .",
    "because of the very short exposure time ( @xmath10 3  ksec ) , our analysis of the source has determined only a 2@xmath22 upper limit of 0.26 in 15100 kev , corresponding to 1.6 mcrab , however compatible with the background excess measured in obs2 .",
    "moreover , just in the center of the + off field is also present the extremely weak rosat source rx  j125847.1 + 242741 .",
    "the presence of these contaminating sources justified the decision to exclude the + off field in the background evaluation and consider only the off field as the `` uncontaminated '' background for both the coma observations .",
    "the combined spectrum , obtained by summing the spectra of the two observations ( obs1 & obs2 ) , shows a hard excess with respect to the thermal component at the confidence level ( c.l . ) of @xmath23 in the 20 - 80 kev energy range considering only the -off background spectrum .",
    "the spectrum is reported in fig.1 .",
    "ff04 also reported the confidence level of the excess considering the standard procedure , i.e. by using as background the average of the spectra extracted from both the two offset fields .",
    "the c.l . is lower ( @xmath24 ) due to the contamination in the + off background .",
    "the average gas temperature used in the analysis is that measured by of 8.11@xmath250.07 kev ( david 1993 ) in a field of view comparable to that of the pds ( fwhm @xmath26 ) .",
    "this value of the average temperature is confirmed by a determination of that reports a best - fit temperature of 7.90@xmath250.03 kev ( rephaeli & gruber 2002 ) in a field of view of @xmath27 comparable to the field of view of and pds .",
    "the first combined spectrum was extracted considering the pds data resulting by the automatic selection operated by the saxdas package .",
    "the confidence level of the excess , in the range 20 - 80 kev and for an average gas temperature of 8.11 kev , is @xmath10 2.9@xmath22 ( observed count rate = 0.1717@xmath250.0146 , model predicted rate = 0.1295 ) taking into account only the uncontaminated -off position .",
    "the effective exposure time is 42.8 ks in obs1 and 119.3 ks in obs2 for a total exposure time of 162.1 ks . to resolve the discrepancy between these results and those obtained by ff04 with a xas analysis",
    "( see previous section ) , a new combined spectrum was extracted considering the _ same _ time windows used in the xas analysis .",
    "these time windows are different from those used by rm04 in their saxdas analysis .",
    "the reason is in the different criterion for eliminating the spurious spikes produced by the charged particles that interact with the pds detectors : a semi - automated procedure ( i.e. an automated procedure followed by a visual check ) for xas and a completely automated procedure for saxdas ( guainazzi & matteuzzi 1997 ) . with the same time windows used by xas , the c.l . of",
    "the excess in the saxdas spectrum raises at @xmath10 4.2@xmath22 ( observed count rate = 0.1902@xmath250.0148 , model predicted rate = 0.1280 ) , while the total exposure time reduces to 160.9 ks ( it was 162.1 ks ) .    the two packages , starting from the same time windows , produce a difference in the total effective exposure time of 5.8 ks ( @xmath28 = 166.7 ks , @xmath29 = 160.9 ) essentially due to : a ) the different earth angle above which data are selected ( the earth angle is defined as the angle between the earth limb and the pointing direction ) . the earth angle is 5@xmath30 for xas and 10@xmath30 for saxdas ; b ) the removal of observational time after any south atlantic geomagnetic anomaly ( saga ) passage .",
    "the saxdas package removes 5 minutes after any passage , while xas eliminates the time necessary to reach the correct voltage of the instruments after their shut - down during the saga passage .    in conclusion",
    ", we have a lower exposure time for the saxdas analysis which may imply a lower c.l . of the excess .",
    "to quantify this difference we have extracted a further combined spectrum using the same time windows selected in the xas analysis but imposing an earth angle of 5@xmath30 in the saxdas package .",
    "the total effective time exposure of the two observations is now @xmath29 = 169.1 ks instead of 160.9 ks .",
    "the excess results to be at the c.l . of @xmath10 4.6@xmath22 (",
    "observed count rate = 0.1944@xmath250.0144 , model predicted rate = 0.1280 ) .",
    "this hxr spectrum is reported in fig .",
    "the difference in the initial energy of the saxdas and xas spectra ( saxdas spectrum starts at 12 kev , while xas at 15 kev ) gives insignificant variations in the c.l .",
    "values of the excess .",
    "the systematic errors examined by rm04 and ne04 have already been discussed by us in the pds analysis of a2256 ( fusco - femiano , landi & orlandini 2005 ) , but considering their importance in the analysis results we intend to report here again the main parts of the discussion .",
    "\\1 ) rm04 claim the presence of an `` instrumental background residual '' ( see sect .",
    "2.1 of their paper ) derived from the analysis of 15 `` blank fields '' , i.e. fields which do not contain sources showing significant emission in the pds energy range . by summing the spectra from these observations",
    "they find that the spectrum differs from zero : the count rate is ( @xmath31 in the 12 - 100 kev energy range .",
    "this seems to indicate that the background in the on position is larger than that in the @xmath25off positions producing an instrumental contribution not removed by the background subtraction procedure .",
    "this effect has been studied by landi ( 2005 ) considering the complete sample of 868 pds pointings with galactic latitude @xmath32 , and selecting the 15100 kev net count spectra for which there is source detection below 1@xmath22 ( that is , `` blank fields '' ) .",
    "these spectra have been summed imposing a net exposure greater than 20  ksec",
    ". a net count rate of @xmath33 has been derived , consistent with the definition of `` blank field '' . also ne04 do not report evidence for an instrumental residual .",
    "\\2 ) the other effect evaluated by rm04 regards the systematic differences between the background fields .",
    "they analyze a sample of 69 observations whose target is outside the galactic plane and with a long exposure time ( see appendix of their paper ) .",
    "rm04 find that the mean value of the difference between on and the two -off and + off sky positions is significantly different from zero and positive .",
    "also this effect has been investigated by landi ( 2005 ) on the _ whole _ sample of pds observations .",
    "the obtained value of @xmath34 is consistent with no contamination at all .",
    "we presume that the value found by rm04 could be due to the small sample of observations they considered .",
    "ne04 , analyzing a larger sample of data with respect to that used by rm04 ( 164 pds observations ) , found a systematic difference between on and the two offset pointings that cancels out in the standard usage of both offsets .",
    "\\3 ) in addition , ne04 introduce a systematic error in the net source count rates due to unresolved and not significantly detected point sources present in the pds field of view .",
    "they find that an excess of 0.019 counts  s@xmath3 has to be added to the net count rate spectra ( no errors are given on this measurement ) , when the standard method of background evaluation is used , and 0.027 counts  s@xmath3 has to be added when the background is evaluated from only one offset field .",
    "we performed this same analysis on a set of 868 observations ( ne04 use 164 fields ) and find that the contribution of background fluctuations due to unresolved and not significantly detected sources in the offset fields ( in other words , the pds confusion limit ) introduces a variance @xmath35 ( counts  s@xmath3)@xmath36 consistent with zero ( fusco - femiano , landi & orlandini 2005 )",
    ". therefore pds data are not affected by this systematic effect .",
    "2 shows that also the pds combined spectrum extracted with the saxdas package evidences the presence of a excess with respect to the thermal emission at about the same c.l . reported by the xas analysis ( ff04 ) ( @xmath10 4.8@xmath22 for xas and @xmath10 4.6@xmath22 for saxdas ) .",
    "the discrepancy between the results reported in ff04 and rm04 is mainly due : a ) to an accurate selection of the events .",
    "in fact , we have shown that the saxdas analysis of the same pds time windows used with the xas software leads to a significant increase of the c.l .",
    "of the excess ( from @xmath37 to @xmath38 ) ; b ) to a correct determination of the background . the xas and saxdas spectra shown in fig.1 and fig .",
    "2 , respectively , are obtained considering only the -off background .",
    "the exclusion of the + off position in the background determination implies a more pronounced detection of radiation from the coma cluster .",
    "the check regarding the presence of contaminating sources in the + off field was not operated by rm04 .",
    "an increase of @xmath10 0.4@xmath22 in the c.l .",
    "value is obtained adopting in the saxdas analysis the same earth angle of @xmath39 used in the xas procedure .",
    "the lower earth angle implies a greater exposure time that justify an improvement in the c.l .",
    "value of the excess .",
    "considering in the saxdas analysis the same time windows and the same earth angle used in the xas analysis the difference in the total exposure time is 2.4 ks in favour of the saxdas package ( @xmath28 = 166.7 ks , @xmath29 = 169.1 ks ) due to the different removal of the time operated by the two packages after any saga passage .",
    "the xas package results to be more conservative waiting more time than saxdas to allow the pds high voltage to reach the correct levels .",
    "so , some spurious events could be present in the saxdas analysis , in particular for the longer obs2 observation .    in order to reproduce the results obtained by rm04",
    "we have computed the c.l . of the excess for obs1 and obs2 spectra ( rm04 do not report the c.l . value for the combined spectrum ) using the automatic selection of the events operated by the saxdas package and the standard procedure for the background determination .",
    "values are 2.90@xmath22 and 1.34@xmath22 for obs1 and obs2 , respectively , in the energy range 25 - 80 kev and for an average gas temperature of 8.21 kev",
    ". these values are not much distant from those reported in table 2 of rm04 ( 2.84@xmath22 for obs1 and 1.11@xmath22 for obs2 ) confirming that the selection procedure of the pds events and the exclusion of the + off position for the background determination are the main reasons of the different results reported in ff04 and rm04 .",
    "the pds data analysis of very weak sources like coma in the hxr band requires a rigorous selection of the events in order to eliminate the presence of any spikes able to introduce _ noise _ that hides the presence of a excess with respect to the thermal radiation .",
    "the presence of contaminating sources in the offset fields does not allow the use of the standard procedure for the background evaluation .",
    "we have shown that the presence of a excess with respect to the thermal emission in the spectrum of the coma cluster does not depend on the used software package ( xas or saxdas ) for the pds data analysis .",
    "the spectra extracted with xas and saxdas , reported in fig .",
    "1 and 2 , respectively , show both a excess at about the same c.l .",
    "value when in the saxdas analysis the same time windows used in the xas analysis ( ff04 ) are adopted and the + off sky direction is not taken into account in the background determination for the presence of contaminating sources .",
    "the systematic effects claimed by rm04 and ne04 can be excluded considering the whole sample of the pds observations off the galactic plane .",
    "this re - analysis of the pds data , using the saxdas package , explains the different results reported in ff04 and rm04 confirming the presence of a component in the coma cluster spectrum .",
    "we wish to thank l.feretti and g.giovannini for a critical reading of the paper and the referee for his helpful comments on the manuscript ."
