    "recently new narrow scalar resonances @xmath0 and @xmath1 were discovered at babar @xcite , cleo @xcite and belle @xcite .",
    "they are not expected to be standard hadrons because their masses are close to hundred mev smaller than the ones predicted in quark models for positive parity @xmath6 quark - antiquark mesons @xcite .",
    "for instance the experimental candidate to the first quark - antiquark @xmath6 meson is the @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this is confirmed by lattice simulations @xcite for quark - antiquark mesons .",
    "the existence of non - mesonic and non - hadronic multiquarks has been suggested form the onset of the quark model @xcite .",
    "these positive parity @xmath6 resonances are interpreted by beveren and rupp @xcite as poles in the s matrix of the coupled channels of mesons and meson pairs .",
    "they were also predicted by nowak , rho and zahed @xcite as chiral partners of the well known negative parity pseudoscalar @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "they are as well interpreted as k - d molecules by barnes , close and lipkin @xcite , similar to the deusons anticipated by tornqvist @xcite . in the same way i find here that the new @xmath6 resonances can be understood as tetraquarks , or equivalently as s - wave @xmath10-@xmath11 molecules bound by the short range attraction .    the experimental discovery of these hadron also suggests the existence of a new class of multiquarks . in this paper",
    "i study the family of all possible narrow tetraquark and pentaquark resonances where the quark @xmath12 , or the @xmath2 kaon play a crucial role .",
    "the strangeness @xmath13 pentaquark @xmath14 is more difficult to bind and was recently addressed with the same techniques of this paper in reference @xcite .",
    "a chiral invariant framework @xcite is used to compute microscopically , at the quark level , the masses of this new class of hadrons . the resulting mechanism which provides the binding of the @xmath2 tetraquarks and pentaquarks is equivalent to the short range attraction of hadrons .    here",
    "a standard quark model ( qm ) hamiltonian is assumed , @xmath15 where each quark or antiquark has a kinetic energy @xmath16 with a constituent quark mass , and the colour dependent two - body interaction @xmath17 includes the standard qm confining and hyperfine terms , @xmath18 \\ . \\label{potential}\\ ] ] moreover the hamiltonian includes a quark - antiquark annihilation term @xmath19 which is the result of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "this paper is organised in sections . in section",
    "ii the qm is reviewed , together with the resonating group method ( rgm ) @xcite which is adequate to study multiquark states , where several quarks overlap .",
    "the rgm , together with chiral symmetry , produces short range hadron - hadron potentials , which can be either repulsive ( hardr core repulsion ) or attractive . in section",
    "iii a criterion is derived to discriminate which systems bind and which are unbound .",
    "this criterion is applied to find , among the s - wave hadrons , the candidates to trap a kaon . in section",
    "iv the binding energy is computed for the selected positive parity mesons @xmath20 and negative parity baryons @xmath21 . finally the results are presented and discussed in section v.",
    "for the purpose of this paper the details of potential ( [ hamiltonian ] ) are unimportant , only its matrix elements matter .",
    "the hadron spectrum constrains the hyperfine potential , @xmath22 the quark - antiquark annihilation potential @xmath19 is also constrained when the quark model produces spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "the annihilation potential @xmath23 is present in the @xmath24 salpeter equation , @xmath25 \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } \\phi^+ \\\\",
    "\\phi^- \\end{array } \\right ) = m_\\pi \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } \\phi^+ \\\\",
    "-\\phi^- \\end{array } \\right ) \\label{pion bs}\\ ] ] where the @xmath24 is the only hadron with a large negative energy wave - function , @xmath26 . in eq .",
    "( [ pion bs ] ) the annihilation potential @xmath23 cancels most of the kinetic energy and confining potential @xmath27 .",
    "this is the reason why the pion has a very small mass . from the hadron spectrum and using eq .",
    "( [ pion bs ] ) the matrix elements of the annihilation potential are determined , @xmath28 where this result is correct for the annihilation of @xmath29 or @xmath30 quarks . when a strange quark is present , the corresponding matrix element is smaller by a factor @xmath31 which is a power of the constituent quark mass ratio @xmath32    ( 200,80)(0,0 ) ( 20,5 )    ( 120,30)(0,0 ) ( 20,0 )    ( 100,100)(0,0 ) ( 0,20)(1,0)100 ( 50,5)@xmath33 ( 60,60)(-1,-4)10 ( 65,41)@xmath34 ( 10,60)(1,0)100 ( 60,70)@xmath35    ( 20,0 )    ( 100,100)(0,0 ) ( -15,18)@xmath36 ( 0,20 ) ( 110,18)@xmath37 ( 102,20 ) ( -5,58)@xmath38 ( 10,60 ) ( 120,58)@xmath39 ( 112,60 )    the qm of eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) reproduces the meson and baryon spectrum with quark and antiquark bound - states ( from the heavy quarkonium to the light pion mass ) .",
    "moreover the rgm was first used in hadronic physics by ribeiro @xcite to show that in exotic hadron - hadron scattering , the quark - quark potential together with the pauli repulsion of quarks produces a repulsive short range interaction .",
    "for instance this explains the @xmath40 hard core repulsion , preventing the collapse of nuclei .",
    "this @xmath40 hard core repulsion is supposed to also occur in several hadron - hadron interactions , and this explains why many multiquarks systems are not stable .",
    "however deus and ribeiro @xcite used the same rgm to show that , in non - exotic channels , the quark - antiquark annihilation could produce a short core attraction .",
    "recently it was shown that in the particular case of the low energy @xmath41 system in the chiral limit , the short range attraction and repulsion exactly cancel @xcite , resulting in a adler zero and the weinberg theorem . addressing a tetraquark system with the @xmath41 quantum numbers",
    ", it was shown that the qm also fully complies with the chiral symmetry , including the pcac theorems @xcite .",
    "therefore the qm is adequate to address the new @xmath6 hadrons , which were predicted by nowak , rho and zahed in an effective chiral model . in this paper",
    "the qm and the rgm are applied to @xmath2 multiquarks .",
    "the rgm @xcite computes the effective multiquark energy using the matrix elements of the microscopic quark - quark interactions .",
    "any multiquark state can be decomposed in combinations of simpler colour singlets , the baryons and mesons .",
    "this can be illustrated with the colour structure of a multiquark with two quark - antiquark pairs , @xmath42 .",
    "assuming that this tetraquark is a colour singlet , each quark - antiquark pair can either be a colour singlet or a colour octet .",
    "nevertheless the octet - octet state can be described with an exchange operator and with the singlet - singlet state , @xmath43 and there is only one anti - symmetrised state , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the quark and antiquark anti - symmetriser .",
    "therefore the multiquarks can be described with an anti - symmetrised basis of baryons and mesons .",
    "the multiquark may only be a bound state , or a narrow resonance , if these baryons and mesons are sufficiently attracted .",
    "thus the problem of multiquark stability can be technically reduced to the problem of the binding of baryons or mesons .",
    "the rgm produces both the energy of a multiquark state and the effective hadron - hadron interaction .",
    "the energy of the multiquark is computed with the matrix elements of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the wave functions of quarks are arranged in anti - symmetrised overlaps of simple colour singlet hadrons . as an example , in fig .",
    "[ rgm coordinates ] , a tetraquark system is arranged in a pair of mesons @xmath23 and @xmath46 .",
    "once the internal energies @xmath47 and @xmath48 of the two hadronic clusters are accounted , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the anti - symmetrizer , the remaining energy of the meson - baryon or meson - meson system is computed with the overlap of the inter - cluster microscopic potentials , @xmath51| \\phi_a \\phi_b \\rangle   \\nonumber \\\\ & & / \\langle \\phi_b \\ , \\phi_a |   ( 1+p_{ab})(1-   p_{13 } ) | \\phi_a \\phi_b \\rangle \\ , \\label{overlap kernel } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 stands for the exchange of particle @xmath53 with particle @xmath54 , see fig .",
    "[ rgm overlaps ] .",
    "in what concerns the annihilation potential , it only occurs in non - exotic channels .",
    "then it is clear from eqs .",
    "( [ sum rules ] ) that the annihilation potential provides an attractive ( negative ) overlap .",
    "this confirms that the hard core can be attractive for non - exotic channels where annihilation occurs .    in what concerns the quark - quark(antiquark ) potential , it may also contribute to exotic channels .",
    "because the potential @xmath17 is assumed to be proportional to the colour dependent @xmath55 it is clear that it can only contribute together with an exchange interaction , which provides a color octet , see eq .",
    "( [ octet ] ) .",
    "moreover the spin independent part of the interaction vanishes .",
    "for instance in the meson - meson overlap of eq .",
    "( [ overlap kernel ] ) the overlap of @xmath56 essentially cancels with the overlap of @xmath57 . the only potential which may contribute is the hyperfine potential , proportional to @xmath58 . in the present case where the kaon is a spin singlet ,",
    "the minus phase from colour is inverted by a minus phase from spin .",
    "i find that the total colour and spin matrix element is a hyperfine splitting , @xmath59 the flavour trace is quite simple and the spatial integral provides a geometrical overlap .",
    "all the corresponding factors are positive , an therefore the quark - quark interaction results in a repulsive interaction .",
    "these results are independent of the particular quark model that one chooses to consider , providing it is chiral invariant",
    ". therefore two opposite classes of diagrams exist .",
    "the exchange diagrams produce a repulsive interaction , which turns out to be proportional to the hyperfine quark - quark(antiquark ) interaction .",
    "the annihilation diagrams produce an attractive interaction , which turns out to be proportional to the spin - independent quark - quark(antiquark ) interaction .",
    "i arrive at the attraction / repulsion criterion for the short range hadron - hadron interaction , + - _ whenever the two interacting hadrons have quarks ( or antiquarks ) with a common flavour , the repulsion is increased , + - when the two interacting hadrons have a quark and an antiquark with the same flavour , the attraction is enhanced _ .",
    "this paper is dedicated to the class of resonances which can be understood as a s=-1 kaon @xmath60 or @xmath61 strongly trapped by a s - wave hadron .",
    "the criterion shows that all hadrons with an antiquark @xmath62 or @xmath63 or with a a quark @xmath12 allow the exchange overlap @xmath64 , and this would certainly contribute to repulsion @xcite .",
    "although systems with both a short range repulsion and a short range attraction may still bind @xcite , i specialize here in systems where clearly there is no hard core repulsion . in what concerns attraction",
    ", a quark @xmath29 or @xmath30 is needed in the s - wave partner of the kaon , in order to produce annihilation .",
    "therefore the isospin of the partner of the kaon needs to be close to the opposite isospin of the kaon .",
    "this excludes the mesons @xmath65 .",
    "moreover i also specialise in systems which may achieve a remarkable stability , where the kaon partner is a hadronic resonance with a very narrow width .",
    "this not only essentially restricts the kaon partner to s - wave mesons and baryons , it also excludes the meson @xmath66 and the baryon @xmath67 because they are very wide , due to the decay with a pion production .",
    "the pion is also excluded because it is too light to bind to the kaon , all that one may get is a very broad resonance , the kappa resonance @xcite , which has been recently confirmed by the scientific community . therefore the hadrons which are best candidates to strongly bind the kaons @xmath68 are the s - wave hadrons with flavor @xmath69 .",
    "this is expected to result in the @xmath70 @xcite , the @xmath71 @xcite the @xmath72 @xcite , the @xmath73 and several other resonances .",
    "a convenient approximation for the meson and baryon s - wave wave - functions is the harmonic oscillator goundstate wave - function , @xmath74 where , in the case of vanishing external momenta @xmath75 and @xmath76 , the momentum integral in eq .",
    "( [ overlap kernel ] ) is simply @xmath77 .",
    "the coordinates of the incoming @xmath78 functions are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ rgm coordinates ] , while the coordinates of the outgoing @xmath79 have the quark 1 and 3 exchanged .",
    "i summarise @xcite the effective potentials computed for the different channels , @xmath80 where the colour and spin factors contribute respectively with @xmath81 and @xmath82 , @xmath83 is of the order of 430 mev and the geometrical factor is @xmath84 .",
    "the remaining factor is the flavour factor .",
    "the parameter @xmath85 is the only one that is model dependent , and it will be determined with a fit of experimental binding energies .",
    "the estimation of @xmath85 is an important by - product of this method because the hadronic size can not be estimated directly by the hadronic charge radius which is masked by the vector meson dominance .",
    "( 100,150)(0,0 ) ( -70,0 ) ( 0,140)@xmath86 ( 30,40)@xmath87    to study binding one has to proceed to the finite momentum case . then the effective potentials in eq .",
    "( [ zero p ] ) turn out to be multiplied by the gaussian separable factor , @xmath88 \\int \\frac{d^3 p'_\\lambda}{(2 \\pi)^3 } \\exp\\left[- \\frac { { p'_\\lambda}^2}{2 \\beta^2}\\right]$ ] . in the exotic channels with exchange diagrams only",
    ", this result can be prooved @xcite , and moreover the new parameter @xmath89 .",
    "this occurs because the overlaps decrease when the relative momentum of the hadrons @xmath23 and @xmath46 increases . in the non - exotic channels with annihilation diagrams",
    "the present state of the art of the rgm does not allow a precise determination of the finite momentum overlap .",
    "nevertheless , it is expected that eventually the overlap decreases due to the geometrical wave - function overlap in momentum space . here",
    "the precise determination of @xmath90 does not affect the results .",
    "i order to reduce the number of parameters , and for simplicity , in this paper i assume that @xmath91 . for other approaches that also lead to a separable potential , see for instance ref .",
    "this parametrisation of the schrdinger equation in a separable potential , @xmath92 |\\psi_\\lambda>=0 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] enables the use of standard techniques @xcite to exactly compute the scattering @xmath93 matrix , @xmath94 the binding occurs when the @xmath93 matrix has a pole for a negative relative energy , @xmath95 in fig .",
    "[ g0 of energy ] the function @xmath96 is plotted .",
    "@xmath96 is real for a negative relative energy @xmath97 and is complex for positive @xmath97 .",
    "the binding only occurs if , @xmath98 using fig . [ g0 of energy ]",
    "it is possible to determine the parameter @xmath85 which reproduces the experimentally measured binding energy of the @xmath99 . with a binding energy of @xmath100 mev ,",
    "the corresponding parameter @xmath85 is 285 mev .",
    "this corresponds to a radius of @xmath101 fm for the nucleon .",
    "i now compute the binding energies of the kaonic strongly bound molecules , or equivalently strange multiquarks .",
    "these multiquarks are divided into two different families which are respectively coupled and decoupled to pionic channels .",
    "the computations are straightforward and the results are displayed in tables [ missing couple channels ] and [ binding energies ] .      .",
    "this table summarises the parameters @xmath102 and binding energies @xmath46 ( in mev ) @xcite for the channels closed to pion decay .",
    "the italic binding energy @xmath103 of the @xmath104 is fitted from experiment . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]        i find that , in a microscopic and chiral invariant calculation , the new hadrons appear as tetraquarks , or as pentaquarks . in a macroscopic hadron - hadron interaction perspective , the resulting mechanism which provides the binding is the short range strong attraction of hadrons . technically is is not possible distinguish a microscopic multiquark from a macroscopic strongly bound s - wave molecule , because the hadrons totaly overlap .",
    "the purely molecular pattern only appears in different cases , when there is some repulsion which produces the clustering of quarks , and this may happen in the  pentaquark  family of exotics @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the molecular perspective is convenient to estimate the mass of the multiquark because the binding energies are not very large , and the mass is essentially the sum of the kaon plus hadron mass , with a relatively small binding energy .    the chiral excitation perspective , present in the chiral soliton model @xcite or in the chiral lagrangian , @xcite may also be eventually equivalent to the multiquark , or to the two - hadron narrow bound molecule .",
    "suppose that a flavour singlet quark - antiquark pair @xmath105 or @xmath106 is created in a given hadron @xmath107 .",
    "when the resulting multiquark @xmath108 remains bound , we have a state with an opposite parity to the original @xmath107 .",
    "the reversed parity occurs due to the intrinsic parity of fermions and anti - fermions .",
    "moreover , because s - waves are expected to have the lowest mass , this is equivalent to adding a pseudoscalar meson to the original @xmath107 .",
    "the finite masses of the kaon and of the pion prevent the existence of a large number of pseudoscalar mesons in the multiquark family of the @xmath0 . in this family",
    "the mass shift is of the order of the kaon mass minus the binding energy minus the strange - light quark mass difference @xmath109 , and this results in a mass shift close to 350 mev .",
    "the same mass shift is expected in the whole family of the @xmath0 .",
    "thus the multiquarks @xmath108 studied in this paper can be regarded as the chiral partners of the original @xmath107 , in agreement with nowak , rho and zahed .",
    "nevertheless the standard @xmath110 quark - antiquark @xmath6 meson remains a chiral partner of the @xmath111 one , where the mass shift is a result of the angular momentum and spin excitations . in the present framework both the quark - antiquark creation and the angular momentum excitation",
    "chiral excitations can be understood .",
    "the presented results only depend on the hadronic size @xmath85 and not on the details of the quark - quark interactions , because the assumptions are quite simple .",
    "i also assumed that the inverse radius parameters @xmath85 and @xmath90 are identical for all channels , although small channel dependences are expected .",
    "moreover i neglected the meson exchange interactions because they are expected to be smaller than the hard core interaction . in the same way i did not consider the s - channel coupling to a single meson or baryon .",
    "more importantly , in the second family of multiquarks , the coupling to pionic channels was neglected although this coupling conserves isospin .",
    "it would be particularly interesting to study these neglected effects in the second family studied in this paper , in order to check if they correct the computed binding which seems too strong .",
    "because the research in this direction will be model dependent , this will be done elsewhere .",
    "the short range attraction studied in this paper is quite general and can also be applied to the different candidates to multiquarks which have been discovered quite recently @xcite",
    ". this will also be applied elsewhere .",
    "i thank emilio ribeiro for discussions on the rgm , and george rupp for discussions on hadronic resonances .",
    "i am very grateful to gonalo marques for discussions on the family of hadronic molecules , and on the algebraic computations of this paper .",

    "<S> i study the @xmath0 and @xmath1 discovered at babar , cleo and belle , and find that they belong to a class of strange @xmath2 tetraquarks and pentaquarks , which is equivalent to the class of kaonic molecules bound by short range attraction . in this class of hadrons a kaon is strongly trapped by a s - wave meson or baryon . to describe this class of multiquarks the resonating group method </S>",
    "<S> is applied to a standard quark model with chiral symmetry breaking , and the short range kaon - meson(baryon ) interactions are extracted . </S>",
    "<S> a criterion is derived to classify the attractive channels . </S>",
    "<S> i conclude that the mesons @xmath3 , and the baryons @xmath4 clearly belong to the new hadronic class of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the hadrons @xmath5 possibly belong to a related family . </S>"
