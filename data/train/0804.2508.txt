    "is known as the lower dimensional , or _ thin obstacle problem _ , with @xmath12 known as the _",
    "thin obstacle_. it is akin to the _ classical obstacle problem _ , where @xmath13 is constrained to stay above an obstacle @xmath12 which is assigned in the whole domain @xmath0 .",
    "however , whereas the latter is by now well - understood , the thin obstacle problem still presents considerable challenges and only recently there has been some significant progress on it . while we defer a discussion of the present status of the problem and of some important open questions to the last section of this paper , for an introduction to this and related problems we refer the reader to the book by friedman @xcite*chapter 1 , section 11 as well as to the survey of uraltseva @xcite .",
    "the thin obstacle problem arises in a variety of situations of interest for the applied sciences .",
    "it presents itself in elasticity ( see for instance @xcite ) , when an elastic body is at rest , partially laying on a surface @xmath2 .",
    "it also arises in financial mathematics in situations in which the random variation of an underlying asset changes discontinuously , see @xcite , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "it models the flow of a saline concentration through a semipermeable membrane when the flow occurs in a preferred direction ( see @xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath2 and @xmath12 are smooth , it has been proved by caffarelli @xcite that the minimizer @xmath13 in the thin obstacle problem is of class @xmath14 . since we can make free perturbations away from @xmath2 , it is easy to see that @xmath13 satisfies @xmath15 but in general @xmath13 does not need to be harmonic across @xmath2 . instead , on @xmath2 , one has the following complementary conditions @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the outer unit normals to @xmath18 on @xmath2 .",
    "one of the main objects of study in this problem is the so - called _ coincidence set _ @xmath19 and its boundary ( in the relative topology on @xmath2 ) @xmath20 known as the _ free boundary_.    a similar problem is obtained when @xmath2 is a part of @xmath21 and one minimizes @xmath22 over the convex set @xmath23 in this case @xmath13 is harmonic in @xmath0 and satisfies the complementary conditions @xmath24 on @xmath2 , where @xmath25 is the outer unit normal on @xmath21 .",
    "this problem is known as the _ boundary thin obstacle problem _ or the _",
    "signorini problem_. note that in the case when @xmath2 is a plane and @xmath0 and @xmath26 are symmetric with respect to @xmath2 , then the thin obstacle problem in @xmath0 is equivalent to the boundary obstacle problem in @xmath4 .",
    "there has been a recent surge of activity in the area of thin obstacle problems since the work of athanasopoulos and caffarelli @xcite , where the optimal @xmath27 interior regularity has been established for the solutions of the signorini problem with flat @xmath2 and @xmath28 .",
    "a different perspective was brought in with the paper @xcite , where extensive use was made of the celebrated monotonicity of almgren s _ frequency function _",
    ", @xmath29 see @xcite , and also @xcite , @xcite for generalizations to variable coefficient elliptic operators in divergence form .",
    "the name frequency comes from the fact that when @xmath13 is a harmonic function in @xmath30 homogeneous of degree @xmath31 , then @xmath32 . using such monotonicity of the frequency",
    "the authors were able to show fine regularity properties of the free boundary ; namely , that the set of so - called regular free boundary points is locally a @xmath33-manifold of dimension @xmath34 .",
    "when the obstacle is the function @xmath35 and @xmath2 is flat , then a point of the free boundary is called _ regular _ if at such point the frequency attains its least possible value @xmath36 ( see lemma [ lem : min - homogen ] and definition [ def : regfb ] below ) .",
    "for instance the origin is a regular free boundary point for @xmath37 .",
    "the reader is also referred to section  [ sec : known - results ] for a detailed description of the main results in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "another line of developments has emerged from the fact that in the particular case @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the signorini problem can be interpreted as an obstacle problem for the fractional laplacian on @xmath40 @xmath41 with @xmath42 . a more general range of fractional powers @xmath43 has been considered by silvestre @xcite , who has proved the almost optimal regularity of the solutions : @xmath44 for any @xmath45 .",
    "subsequently , caffarelli , salsa , and silvestre @xcite have established the optimal @xmath46 regularity and generalized the free boundary regularity results of @xcite to this setting .",
    "one interesting aspect of @xcite is that the authors are able to treat the case when the thin obstacle @xmath12 is nonzero .",
    "they prove a generalization of almgren s monotonicity of the frequency for solutions of the thin obstacle problem with nonzero thin obstacles , see section  [ sec : gener - freq - form ] below . with this tool",
    "they establish the optimal interior regularity of the solution , and the regularity of the free boundary at the regular points .      in the thin obstacle problem",
    "one can subdivide the free boundary points into three categories : the set of regular points discussed above , the set @xmath47 of the so - called singular points , and the remaining portion of those free boundary points which are neither regular , nor singular . as we have mentioned , the papers @xcite , @xcite and @xcite study the former set .",
    "the main objective of this paper is the study of the singular free boundary points .",
    "more specifically , using methods from geometric pde s we study the structure of the singular set @xmath47 , which we now define .",
    "hereafter , the hypersurface @xmath2 is assumed to be the hyperplane @xmath48 .",
    "a free boundary point @xmath49 is called _ singular _ if the coincidence set @xmath50 has a vanishing @xmath3-hausdorff density at @xmath51 , i.e. @xmath52 we denote by @xmath47 the set of singular points .",
    "we observe here that @xmath47 is not necessarily a small part of the free boundary @xmath53 in any sense .",
    "in fact , it may happen that the whole free boundary is composed exclusively of singular points .",
    "this happens for instance when @xmath13 is a harmonic function , symmetric with respect to @xmath2 , touching a zero obstacle ( see also figure  [ fig : example ] below ) .",
    "one of the main difficulties in our analysis consists in establishing the uniqueness of the blowups , which are the limits of properly defined rescalings of @xmath13 , see below .",
    "proving such uniqueness is equivalent to showing that at any @xmath54 one has a taylor expansion @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a nondegenerate homogeneous polynomial of a certain order @xmath31 , satisfying @xmath57 see theorems  [ thm : k - diff - sing - p ] and [ thm : k - diff - sing - p - nonzero ] below .",
    "the value of @xmath31 must be an even integer , and it is obtained from the above mentioned generalization of almgren s monotonicity of frequency to the thin obstacle problem , see theorems  [ thm : almgren ] and [ thm : gen - almgren ] .    at this point , to put our discussion in a broader perspective , we recall that for the classical obstacle problem a related taylor expansion was originally obtained by caffarelli and rivire @xcite in dimension 2 . in higher dimensions this expansion",
    "was first proved by caffarelli @xcite with the use of a deep monotonicity formula of alt , caffarelli , and friedman @xcite .",
    "subsequently , a different proof based on a simpler monotonicity formula was discovered by weiss @xcite .",
    "more recently , using the result of weiss , monneau @xcite has derived yet another monotonicity formula which is tailor made for the study of the singular free boundary points .",
    "he has then used such formula to prove the above mentioned taylor expansion at singular points of the classical obstacle problem .",
    "now , in the classical obstacle problem the only frequency that appears is @xmath58 .",
    "specifically , the above mentioned monotonicity formulas in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite are only suitable for @xmath59 . in the thin obstacle problem , instead , one the main complications is that at a singular free boundary point the frequency @xmath31 may be an arbitrary even integer @xmath60 , @xmath61 .    with this observation in mind , and the objective of studying singular points ,",
    "our original desire was to construct an analogue of monneau s formula based on almgren s frequency formula , rather than on weiss. this was suggested by the fact that , at least in principle , almgren s frequency formula does not display the limitation of the specific value @xmath62 . in the process , however , we have discovered a new one - parameter family of monotonicity formulas @xmath63 of weiss type ( see theorem [ thm : weiss ] ) which is tailor made for studying the thin obstacle problem , and that , remarkably , is inextricably connected to almgren s monotonicity formula , see section  [ sec : weiss - type - monot ] and [ sec : weiss - monneau - type ] . with these new formulas in hand , following monneau @xcite we have discovered another one - parameter family @xmath64 of monotonicity formulas ( see theorem [ thm : monn - mon - form ] ) which are ad hoc for studying singular free boundary points with frequency @xmath65 , @xmath61 . with this result , in turn",
    ", we have been able to establish the desired taylor expansion mentioned above , thus obtaining the uniqueness of the blowups .",
    "furthermore , the monotonicity formulas @xmath64 allow to establish the nondegeneracy and continuous dependence of the polynomial @xmath66 on the singular free boundary point @xmath51 with frequency @xmath31 .",
    "we should also mention here that in the case of the nonzero thin obstacle @xmath12 there are additional technical difficulties introduced by the error terms in the computations .",
    "in fact , almgren s monotonicity formula in its purest form will not hold in general , but if @xmath12 is assumed to be @xmath67 regular we can establish the monotonicity of the truncated versions @xmath68 of the frequency functional , see theorem  [ thm : gen - almgren ] .",
    "this kind of formula has been used first in @xcite in the case @xmath69 .",
    "because of the truncation , our approach allows to effectively study only the free boundary points at which the frequency takes a value @xmath70 .    finally ,",
    "a standard argument based on whitney s extension theorem implies that the set of singular points is contained in a countable union of @xmath33 regular manifolds of dimensions @xmath71 . in the case of a nonzero obstacle @xmath72",
    "this result is limited to singular points with the frequency @xmath70 . for a precise formulation ,",
    "see theorems  [ thm : sing - points ] and [ thm : sing - points - nonzero ] .      when the thin obstacle @xmath12 is identically zero our constructions and proofs are most transparent . while the majority of our results continue to hold for regular nonzero obstacles , the technicalities of the proofs are overwhelming and",
    "may easily distract from the main ideas . for this reason we have subdivided the paper into two parts : part  [ part : zero - thin - obstacle ] deals exclusively with solutions with a zero thin obstacle @xmath12 , whereas part  [ part : nonz - thin - obst ] deals with a nonzero @xmath12 .",
    "the individual structure of these parts is as follows .    in closing , we would like to mention that , using the extension approach developed in @xcite and @xcite , our technique works also for solutions of the obstacle problem for the fractional laplacian @xmath73 for any @xmath43 .",
    "however , for the sake of exposition , here we restrict ourselves to the case @xmath74 ( i.e.the signorini problem ) .",
    "the consideration of the general case is deferred to a forthcoming paper .",
    "we would like to thank the referee for his / her insightful comments which have contributed to improving the presentation of the paper .",
    "it has also led us to provide an affirmative answer to a question which appeared as a conjecture in the first draft of this paper ( see the part @xmath75 in theorems  [ thm : sing - points ] and [ thm : sing - points - nonzero ] ) .",
    "[ part : zero - thin - obstacle ]",

    "i.e.  @xmath28 and @xmath2 a hyperplane .",
    "since we are interested in the properties of @xmath13 near a free boundary point , after possibly a translation , rotation and scaling , we can assume that @xmath13 is defined in @xmath76 , where @xmath77 moreover , @xmath78 , and it is such that @xmath79 where , we recall , @xmath80 is the coincidence set , and the free boundary @xmath53 is the topological boundary of @xmath50 in the relative topology of @xmath81 .    throughout the paper",
    "we denote by @xmath82 the class of solutions of the normalized signorini problem .",
    "note that we may actually extend @xmath83 by even symmetry to @xmath30 @xmath84 then the resulting function will satisfy @xmath85 it will also be useful to note the following direct relation between @xmath86 and @xmath87 : latexmath:[\\[\\delta u=2(\\partial_{x_n}u)\\ , { \\mathcal{h}}^{n-1}\\big    @xmath87 on @xmath48 we understand the limit @xmath89 from inside @xmath90 .",

    "the complication is that @xmath13 is no longer harmonic in @xmath452 , but instead satisfies @xmath457 this introduces a certain error in the computations that potentially could prevent us from successfully studying nonregular points .",
