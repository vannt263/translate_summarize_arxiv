    "in the 1920 s , debye and hckel ( dh ) @xcite proposed a linearized mean - field description of the bulk thermodynamics of coulomb fluids , which works in the high - temperature region .",
    "a few years earlier , gouy @xcite and chapman @xcite had introduced the nonlinear poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) mean - field treatment of the electric double layer .",
    "it paved the way toward the celebrated dvlo theory of colloidal interactions @xcite .",
    "when it comes to studying colloidal suspensions at finite density , an efficient tool is furthermore provided by the cell model @xcite in which the space around a large charged colloid is modelled by a spherical domain confining the mobile counter - ions of opposite charge . in the context of the pb cell model , the concept of ( effective ) charge renormalization was introduced by alexander et al @xcite .    in the high - temperature region , the pb theory describes adequately many equilibrium and electrokinetic phenomena in coulomb theory of neutral systems with repulsive and attractive forces among the charged objects .",
    "rigorous results on the existence and uniqueness of the solutions of the pb equation were derived by mathematicians @xcite .",
    "two basic kinds of coulomb systems are studied : the two - component electrolyte of @xmath0 charges and the one - component systems of identical charges with a neutralizing uniform background , distributed either in the domain s volume ( jellium models ) or on the domain s boundary ( models with `` counter - ions only '' ) . in the case of one - component systems ,",
    "the pb equation belongs to liouville s type of non - linear differential equations .",
    "exact solutions are available for the effectively one - dimensional ( 1d ) geometry of parallel plates @xcite and for the two - dimensional ( 2d ) cylinder geometry @xcite .",
    "the latter solution is important in the manning theory of counter - ions condensation @xcite which assumes that counter - ions can condense onto the polyion ( a chain of monomer charges , often represented as an idealized line charge ) up to a certain critical value .",
    "the number density of counter - ions at the charged planar surface fulfills the so - called contact theorem @xcite .",
    "an attempt to generalize the contact theorem to curved boundaries was made recently in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the case of purely attractive forces",
    ", the second - order liouville equation plays a fundamental role in the gravitational theory of stellar structure @xcite , in diffusion in chemical kinetics @xcite and in the theory of combustion and thermal explosion @xcite .",
    "in contrast to coulomb fluids , the liouville equation of such systems exhibits minus sign ahead of the exponential ( see below ) .",
    "for both dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions in the spherical geometry , it exhibits multiplicity of solutions @xcite .",
    "the liouville equation can be reduced to the first - order abel s differential equation of the second kind , the so - called enig s equation @xcite .",
    "developments of the liouville equation in the theory of gravitational matter and related combustion systems were generally ignored by the coulomb community because of its different layout and fundamental properties . only in a very recent study of the relaxation and the steady state with an initial injection of ions into a ball described by the poisson - nernst - planck equations @xcite , was the pb equation with a specific initial value problem studied , predominantly numerically , by using equations of enig s type .    in this work ,",
    "we study a system of identical mobile point - like charges ( counter - ions ) confined to a domain with curved hard walls carrying a uniform fixed surface charge density , with the condition of overall electroneutrality .",
    "three domain geometries are considered : a pair of parallel plates , the cylinder and the sphere .",
    "the particles are in thermal equilibrium , and the nonlinear poisson - boltzmann theory rules the mean potential , with appropriate boundary conditions . while the effectively 1d parallel plates and the 2d cylinder have already been solved , the three - dimensional ( 3d ) sphere problem has not .",
    "the contact density of particles at the charged surface is shown to be determined by a first - order abel differential equation of the second kind , which is a counterpart of enig s equation .",
    "this equation enables us to construct the exact series expansions of the contact density in the regions of small and large surface charge densities .",

    "specific algebraic operations with the pb equation imply the corresponding series expansions for the internal energy and the free energy . a brief recapitulation and concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "[ section : conclusion ] .",
    "we emphasize that the geometries considered here for the cylindrical and spherical cases are somewhat simplified as compared to the widely used cell model for colloids . in the latter case indeed , a rod - like or spherical charged macromolecule is placed at the center of a concentric wigner - seitz cell @xcite , assumed to bear a vanishing charge .",
