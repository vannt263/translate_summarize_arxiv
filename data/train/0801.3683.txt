    "there has been rising interest in studying the quasi - local energy ( qle ) inside the event horizon of the schwarzschild geometry @xcite .",
    "however , the absence of physical , static observers on the interior , as exist on the exterior , has prevented a simple passage of qle across the horizon .",
    "the alternative is then to identify families of non - static , non - geodesic and geodesic observers that can actually penetrate the horizon smoothly and measure the qle .",

    "after averaging over @xmath0 and calibrating against the minkowski space reference , the ultimate quantity is the measured qle associated with @xmath0 . among a sea of available observers in a space - time , the most physically meaningful ones are the observer fields that are static and those that are geodesic . in the schwarzschild space - time , no static observer fields can enter the event horizon ; on the other hand , there do exist geodesic observer fields that can cross the event horizon .",
    "hence , to use one observer field as a probe to measure the qle in the schwarzschild space - time , the best candidates would be a non - static , observer field that penetrates the horizon or a geodesic observer field .",
    "the brown - york qle measured by the above two kinds of observer fields in the schwarzschild geometry are examined in this article .",
    "generalizations to other spherically symmetric space - times should be straightforward .",
    "a simple observation regarding the dynamics of the relative quasi - local momentum density in a geodesic observer field is also presented .",
    "a note about the liu - yau qle @xcite in the schwarzschild space - time is recorded here as a comparison . since the construction of the physical part of the liu - yau qle employs a co - dimension 2 embedding of @xmath0 , it is independent , in the exterior of the horizon , of the choice of observer field .",

    ", it yields @xmath236 where @xmath237 is the tidal force exerted on the neighbor tangent to @xmath0 in the @xmath127-direction .",
    "it is hoped that the above analysis provides a slightly different perspective towards understanding the dynamics of the quasi - local momemtum measured by the family of geodesic observers .",
    "the measurements of the brown - york qle in schwarzschild space - time by a non - static , non - geodesic observer field that penetrate the event horizon and by a geodesic observer field have been computed .",
    "it has been shown that due to a different space - time foliation induced by the observer field , the measurement of qle by the non - static , non - geodesic observer field depends on both the radius function @xmath77 and the time function @xmath109 .",
    "the qle measured by a geodesic observer field is , however , linear in the radius function @xmath77 , and can be positive , zero , or negative , depending upon the energy parameter of the geodesic observer field .",
    "these results differ significantly from the measurement by a static observer field in the schwarzschild exterior @xmath46 , which is previously known . on the other hand ,",
    "the liu - yau qle is independent of the choice of observer field in @xmath46 and coincides with the brown - york qle measured by the static observer field in @xmath46 .",
    "however , the liu - yau qle is not defined in schwarzshild interior @xmath53 because the mean curvature vector of the co - dimension 2 isometric embedding of @xmath0 into @xmath2 becomes time - like .    to explore more about the physical nature of qle",
    ", a hypothetical process of building a spherically symmetric massive shell by a static observer field was considered .",
    "the gravitational mass of the spherically symmetric shell is the qle of the shell plus the negative gravitational potential energy associated with the work exercised to build the shell .",
    "the result holds for both the brown - york and the liu - yau qle since they coincide in @xmath46 for the static observer field .",
    "in addition , the qle of a spherically symmetric star with constant density in the interior is also calculated .",
    "the qle grows monotonically with respect to radial distance from the origin in the interior and drops off in the exterior towards the adm mass @xmath59 at infinity , with a cusp on the surface of the star .",
    "it seems to provide certain physical justification for qle as a viable measure of energy .    for a geodesic observer field in the schwarzshild geometry ,",
    "a dynamic relation of the brown - york quasi - local momentum density has been noted .",
    "it is valid for any ricci - flat space - time .",
    "when a family of geodesic observers are assigned on @xmath0 to carry out physical measurements , this relation is expected to describe their relative dynamics .",
    "generalization to more realistic fermi - walker observer fields is straightforward but more complicated ."
