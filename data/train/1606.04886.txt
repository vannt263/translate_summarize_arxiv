    "it remains an open question whether massive neutrinos are majorana particles , whose antiparticles are themselves  @xcite . the final answer to this fundamental question will tell us whether the lepton number is conserved or not in nature , and help us explore the origin of neutrino masses .",
    "currently , the most promising way to answer if massive neutrinos are their own antiparticles is to observe the @xmath0 decays @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 stand respectively for the atomic and mass numbers of a nuclear isotope @xmath22  @xcite . over the last few decades",
    ", a great number of dedicated experiments have been carried out to search for this kind of decays  @xcite .",
    "so far , we have not observed any positive signals , and a lower bound on the half - life of the implemented nuclear isotope can be drawn from experimental data .",
    "the gerda phase - i experiment  @xcite has disproved the signals of @xmath23 decays claimed by the heidelberg - moscow experiment  @xcite , and the joint lower bound from all the previous @xmath24-based experiments on the half - life turns out to be @xmath25 at the @xmath26 confidence level  @xcite . for @xmath27-based experiments ,",
    "a combined analysis of the exo-200  @xcite and kamland - zen phase - i data  @xcite gives rise to a lower bound @xmath28 at the @xmath26 confidence level .",
    "more recently , kamland - zen announced their phase - ii result  @xcite , and improved the lower bound to @xmath29 at the @xmath26 confidence level with both phase - i and phase - ii data .",
    "if neutrino mass ordering is inverted ( i.e. , @xmath30 ) , the next - generation @xmath23 experiments with a few tons of target mass will be able to discover a remarkable signal in the near future  @xcite .",
    "the schechter - valle theorem  @xcite states that a clear signal of @xmath23 decays will unambiguously indicate a finite majorana mass of neutrinos , if neither a fine - tuning among parameters nor a cancellation among different contributions is assumed .",
    "decay rate remains nonzero as the nuclear medium effects on quarks may break any intricate cancellation .",

    "explicitly , assuming one short - range operator to be responsible for @xmath23 decays , they find that current experimental lower bounds on the half - lives of @xmath23-decaying isotopes indicate an upper bound on the majorana neutrino mass @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes the effective neutrino mass term associated with @xmath33 for @xmath34 . in this paper",

    ", we recall the calculation of majorana neutrino masses from the four - loop diagram mediated by the effective operator , which is also responsible for the @xmath0 decays .",

    "this does make sense , since the chirality of electrons in the operator @xmath47 can in general be either left - handed or right - handed . for the same reason , quark masses are also required to realize the hadronic charged - current interactions in the sm . in this case , the operator @xmath48 in fig .",
