    "we would like to point out , that these considerations are only valid in the case of the @xmath3-@xmath4 model , because in the absence of quantum fluctuations , it is energetically favorable to align the spins in the plane perpendicular to the quantization axis  @xcite .",
    "the single - hole ground state therefore carries a total spin @xmath144 .      in the scba for the ising case  ( [ eq : hamtjz ] ) , the bogoliubov parameters and the dispersion are given by @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 .",
    "the dyson equation  ( [ eq : dyson ] ) therefore becomes momentum independent @xmath148 and can be solved analytically  @xcite @xmath149 here @xmath150 is a bessel function of the first kind .",
    "note that the solution  ( [ eq : gtjz ] ) is not an exact solution of the @xmath3-@xmath12 model .",
    "the hole , dispersionless in the scba , is mobile even in the absence of quantum fluctuations due to trugman processes  @xcite .",
    "the simplest one corresponds to the hole motion around an elementary plaquette of the lattice and effectively leads to the propagation of the hole to a next - nearest neighbor without leaving overturned spins behind .",
    "these processes are of sixth and tenth order in @xmath54 for the square and the honeycomb lattice , respectively , and therefore negligible .",
    "more importantly , it was shown in ref .   using a diagrammatic study , that the inclusion of higher order terms ( non - linear hole - magnon , static hole - magnon , direct hole - hole and magnon - magnon ) can lead to substantially different results .",
    "the intuitive picture emerging from that work is as follows : the dynamic hole - magnon interaction considered in the dyson equation  ( [ eq : dysontjz ] ) does not take into account the presence of the hole , which reduces the number of possible sites the hole can hop to and also the energy associated with a flipped spin . in a first step , the hole can hop to @xmath151 nearest neighbors , leaving a flipped spin with energy @xmath152 behind . for the second hopping ,",
    "there are only @xmath153 possible targets and flipping a spin costs an energy @xmath154 .",
    "the dyson equation  ( [ eq : dysontjz ] ) therefore has to be replaced by @xmath155 in this modified approach , the scba gives the exact result in the limit @xmath156 , where the ground state energy is equal to @xmath157 .",
    "for the full @xmath3-@xmath4 model , these geometrical considerations are believed to be less important , because quantum fluctuations restore overturned spins  @xcite .",

    "similar to the square lattice , one finds a very flat band along the edge of the brillouin zone . above @xmath176 ,",
    "the dispersion is well described by next - nearest neighbor hopping @xmath184 .",
    "below @xmath176 further hopping terms become increasingly important and lead to more pronounced hole pockets , analoguos to the square lattice . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : tjh](b ) , the overall shape of the dispersion is very similar in ed calculations , the scba and series expansion .",
    "however , there is a discrepancy concerning the bandwidth : while ed ( with up to 32 sites ) and the scba lead to quantitatively similar results for @xmath185 , series expansion predicts a substantially larger bandwidth , see fig.[fig : tjh](c ) . from a general point of view",
    ", the validity of the scba is limited to small @xmath122 , where the neglected hole - magnon interactions are small .",
    "the results for the @xmath3-@xmath12 model imply that these corrections are more important for the honeycomb lattice than for the square lattice , because of the reduced number of nearest neighbors .",
    "this implication is confirmed by the good agreement with ed calculations for @xmath186 .",
    "still , the noticeably larger bandwidth obtained by series expansion is quite puzzling .",
    "it seems that the difference is essentially due to the very steep band crossing the brillouin zone from @xmath125 to @xmath187 and @xmath41 , because the flat part along the edge from @xmath187 to @xmath41 practically coincides with ed and the scba .",
    "interestingly , the three methods lead to almost identical results for the quasi - particle weight shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : tjh](d ) .",
    "analogous to the square lattice , the weight is substantially reduced but still finite at @xmath188 . in view of the noticeably different predictions concerning the bandwidth , it would be interesting to compare these results with quantum monte - carlo calculations , which could elucidate the problem from a different point of view .",
    "for the first time , we have calculated single - hole properties of both the @xmath3-@xmath12 and the @xmath3-@xmath4 model on the honeycomb lattice using exact diagonalization , series expansion methods and the self - consistent born approximation .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the physically relevant regime @xmath189 .",
    "analogous to calculations for the very similar square lattice , we find an almost flat quasi - particle band along the edge of the magnetic brillouin zone and well defined circular hole pockets in the corners .",
    "the spectral functions show well - defined quasi - particle peaks at the bottom of the spectrum throughout the whole brillouin zone . we find a good agreement between the three methods applied concerning the shape of the single - hole dispersion and the quasi - particle weight .",
    "an analysis of the bandwidth clearly shows that the self - consistent born approximation is quite accurate for @xmath190 , but leads to a substantial underestimation of the bandwidth for larger @xmath122 .",
    "series expansion on the other hand seems to overestimate the bandwidth in the small @xmath122 region .",
    "it is likely that this bandwidth disagreement is due to the reduced `` dimensionality '' of the honeycomb lattice , because the number of nearest neighbors ( @xmath22 ) lies between the square lattice ( @xmath21 ) and the linear chain ( @xmath191 ) .",
    "this makes the problem especially interesting and a monte - carlo calculation would be very helpful to finalize the findings of the present work .",
