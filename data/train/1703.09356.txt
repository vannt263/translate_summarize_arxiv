    "topological insulators  @xcite ( tis ) have emerged as a new materials class that provides a testing ground for exploring ground - breaking new ideas  @xcite about the properties of condensed matter .",
    "realizations are possible in electronically two - dimensional  @xcite ( 2d ) or three - dimensional  @xcite ( 3d ) systems , and simulations using cold atoms subject to artificial gauge fields in optical lattices have been explored  @xcite . quantum confinement was recognized early on as a mechanism for causing a transition between topological and normal phases  @xcite , as well as a tool to manipulate the massless - dirac - like surface ( edge ) states  @xcite of a 3d ( 2d ) ti .",
    "recently , the interplay between topological properties and quantum confinement has been studied as a way to disentangle various phenomena typically associated with topological materials ( protected surface states , band inversion , a finite gap ) in a controlled fashion  @xcite .",
    "we utilize an effective - model description of quantum wells made from ti materials to map changes in the size of the fundamental gap , the degree of band inversion , and the hybridization of surface states in a detailed way .",
    "as we augment the generic @xmath0 hamiltonian  @xcite for 3d tis with a harmonic confinement potential , our work is complementary to previous studies  @xcite where a hard - wall confinement was considered .",
    "further motivation to investigate influences of the confinement strength on 3d - ti properties is provided by the observation that 2d tis ( realized in hgte quantum wells or simulated by cold atoms , respectively ) subjected to soft confinement experience a proliferation of edge modes that modifies topological properties  @xcite .",
    "our results serve to differentiate truly universal behavior from properties that depend on the material and/or the dimensionality .",
    "we identify bi@xmath1te@xmath2 and sb@xmath1te@xmath2 as materials where effects due to size quantization are sufficiently prominent to be accessible experimentally , whereas bi@xmath1se@xmath2 is typically not in a confinement - dominated regime .",
    "strong mixing of 2d subbands occurs for all layered materials in the limit of thicker samples , resulting in the formation of the 2d - dirac - like surface states .",
    "electron - hole asymmetry can partly obscure the observability of topological effects .",
    "unravelling the complexity of these various influences enables us to provide insights to guide future experimental study of confined topological insulators .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "model ] , our effective - model description of a quantum - well - confined 3d ti is introduced and relevant notation established . for instruction and greater clarity ,",
    "basic ramifications of bare subband quantization and confinement - induced subband mixing are discussed for the electron - hole - symmetric case in sections  [ sec : subbands ] and [ sec : bandinv ] , before presenting results for the realistic situation with typically sizable electron - hole asymmetry in section  [ sec : ehas ] .",
    "signatures of topological behavior in the subband dispersions ( section  [ sec : subbands ] ) and in bound - state properties such as the band - inversion - related pseudospin and the surface - state hybridization ( section  [ sec : bandinv ] ) are identified , also with respect to their observability in real ( electron - hole - asymmetric ) systems .",
    "our results are summarized in section  [ sec : concl ] and further illustrated by interactive simulations that are provided as supplementary data .",
    "some more mathematical details about the methods used for calculating 3d - ti - layer subband dispersions and eigenstates are given in the appendix .",
    "our starting point is the effective low - energy model hamiltonian  @xcite describing the 3d - ti material family @xmath3 , with @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",

    "the partition of @xmath24 into its three parts @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 is motivated by the intention to discuss the interplay of various ti band - structure features with a confining potential in @xmath28 direction .",
    "we choose the latter to be of the harmonic - oscillator form given by @xmath29 although it will generally not be a fully realistic approximation for the electronic confinement in thin layers of ti materials , the harmonic - oscillator potential enables an illuminating theoretical treatment of quantum - confinement effects that yields universally applicable conclusions .",
    "furthermore , investigating the features that are specific to a smooth confinement , in contrast to the typically considered abrupt hard - wall  @xcite or infinitely steep inverted - mass  @xcite type , can yield interesting new insights into basic properties of topological protection  @xcite .    to start with",

    "this establishes the characteristic energy scale @xmath39 for size quantization and @xmath40 as a measure for system size in the confined dimension . relating these scales to those relevant for real samples enables useful comparisons and detailed predictions based on our model .",
    "the form of the energy eigenvalues @xmath41 also foreshadows how the positive size - quantization energy competes with band inversion arising from a negative @xmath42 .",

    "characteristic features exhibited by the particular materials systems considered here can thus be rationalized in terms of the specific values of these parameters .",
    "fundamentally , as the system size in the confined direction varies , the gaps of inverted bare - oscillator subbands [ eq .  ( [ eq : topgap ] ) ] are successively closing and reopening .",
    "mixing of bare - oscillator subbands significantly modifies the bare - oscillator subband dispersions in the large - width regime ( @xmath121 ) , establishing the vanishing - mass dirac - like surface - state dispersion and eventually causing the disappearance of oscillations in the fundamental ( lowest - subband ) gap value .",
    "we track the evolution of band inversions by explicit consideration of the pseudo - spin value of eigenstates , establishing the robustness of ti phases with respect to band mixing and electron - hole asymmetry .",
    "in contrast , the occurrence of gap oscillations turns out to be a nonuniversal feature that is generally not a useful measure to monitor ti character in a quantum - confined system .    our study considering 3d tis subject to the harmonic - oscillator confining potential complements previous works that assumed hard - wall confinement .",
    "in contrast to the situation reported in recent analyses of 2d tis  @xcite , the basic features and overall trends associated with the effects of size quantization on 3d - ti properties do not drastically differ between the cases of hard - wall and soft - harmonic - oscillator potentials . instead of the type of confining potential , differences in the 3d - ti bandstructure parameters are a major cause of significant variability in the exhibited behaviors .",
