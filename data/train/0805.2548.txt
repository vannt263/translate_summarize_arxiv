    "the interest in possible high energy violations of local lorentz invariance ( li ) has grown in recent years , encouraged by the flourishing of observational tests and the availability of experimental data .",
    "theoretically , hints of lorentz violation ( lv ) arose from various approaches to quantum gravity ( qg ) @xcite .",
    "while it may seem hopeless to search directly for effects suppressed by the planck scale , it is possible that even tiny corrections can be magnified to measurable ones when dealing with high energies , long distances of propagation or peculiar reactions ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , in order to do so , a complete theoretical framework , within which it is possible to calculate reaction rates and to describe the particle dynamics , is needed .",
    "this is the case of effective field theory ( eft ) with lv operators .",
    "we shall deal here with modified qed via non - renormalizable , planck suppressed lv operators ( the analogue theory with renormalizable operators being already severely constrained @xcite ) .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the addition of the two lowest order non - renormalizable lv operators ( mass dimension 5 and 6 respectively ) to the effective lagrangian of qed leads to the following high - energy modified dispersion relations ( mdr ) ( since the lv correction is proportional to @xmath3 we call them @xmath4mdr with @xmath5 for dimension 5 operators and @xmath6 for dimension 6 ones ) @xmath7 where ( [ eq : disp_rel_phot ] ) refers to photons while ( [ eq : disp_rel_ferm ] ) refers to fermions  mdr contains an extra term , proportional to @xmath8 , due to cpt even dimension 5 operators  @xcite .",
    "however this term is suppressed by @xmath9 . ] .",
    "( in the following we will assume @xmath10 to be comparable to the planck mass @xmath11 . ) the constants @xmath12 and @xmath13 indicate the strength of the lv and take values on the whole real axis .",
    "in ( [ eq : disp_rel_phot ] ) the @xmath14 and @xmath15 signs denote right and left circular polarization , while in ( [ eq : disp_rel_ferm ] ) they indicate opposite helicity fermion states .",
    "a crucial difference between the @xmath5 and @xmath6 cases is the fact that the former is characterized by lv terms which break cpt invariance , while the relevant ones for the @xmath16mdr are cpt even @xcite .",
    "this difference implies that for the @xmath17mdr there is an effective breaking of the symmetry between the two helicity states of the photon .",
    "indeed one finds that @xmath18 , while @xmath19  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it can be shown that the coefficients of electrons and positrons are related as @xmath20 , exploiting the argument given in @xcite .    since suitable powers of the suppressing scale @xmath21",
    "have been already factored out in eq.([eq : disp_rel_phot ] , [ eq : disp_rel_ferm ] ) , natural values of the lv , dimensionless coefficients in ( [ eq : disp_rel_phot ] , [ eq : disp_rel_ferm ] ) are expected to be @xmath22 .    from a purely logical point of view",
    ", it could seem unreasonable to study @xmath1 lv corrections ( those leading to @xmath16mdr ) , as these will be always subdominant with respect to those at @xmath0 ( those leading to @xmath17mdr ) .",
    "however , the reasons for this interest are both empirical and theoretical .    on the observational side ,",
    "the lv parameters @xmath23 are presently constrained to be less than @xmath24 at 95% confidence level ( cl ) by a detailed analysis of the synchrotron component of the crab nebula broadband spectrum @xcite , while the constraint @xmath25 is obtained by considering the absence of vacuum birefringence effects in the propagation of optical / uv polarized light from gamma - ray bursts  @xcite .    on the theoretical side , a reasonably good motivation for focusing on @xmath1 lv corrections is related to the so called  naturalness problem \" @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is generic that , even starting with an eft with only mass dimension 5 or 6 lv operators for free particles , radiative corrections due to particle interactions will generate lower dimension lv terms without introducing any further suppression  @xcite .",
    "hence extra lv terms in @xmath26 and @xmath27 will be generically dominant on higher order lv ones and lead to extremely stringent constraints on the dimensionless lv coefficients @xmath28 .",
    "however , it has been shown  @xcite that if the theory includes supersymmetry ( susy ) , then dimension 3 and 4 , renormalizable , lv operators are forbidden . as a consequence ,",
    "renormalization group equations for supersymmetric qed with dimension 5 lv operators  la myers & pospelov were shown not to generate lower dimensional operators , if susy is unbroken .",
    "susy soft - breaking does lead to lv terms in @xmath26 and @xmath27 , however characterized only by a suppression of order @xmath29 ( @xmath5 ) or @xmath30 ( @xmath6 ) , where @xmath31 is the scale of susy soft breaking @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , given the present constraints , dimension 5 lv operators would induce dimension 3 ones which are already tremendously constrained .",
    "hence , in the @xmath5 case one would have to require unnaturally small lv coefficients in order to have a viable model . on the contrary ,",
    "if @xmath32 then the induced dimension 4 terms are suppressed enough to be compatible with current constraints without requiring @xmath33 much less than one , provided @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , missing an alternative  custodial symmetry \" for lv with respect to susy , qed dimension 5 lv operators seem problematic , while dimension 6 lv , cpt even , ones are favored .    at present , a clear general argument , as to why dimension 5 lv operators should not appear , is missing .",
    "however , if we assume , together with susy symmetry with @xmath34 , also cpt invariance for the planck scale theory , then not only dimension 3 and 4 , but also dimension 5 , cpt odd , lv operators would be forbidden and only cpt even , dimension 6 ones would appear in the effective lagrangian @xcite  .",
    "given this state of affairs , we shall provide here constraints on both dimension 5 and dimension 6 operators separately .",
    "of course , in order to do so for dimension 6 operators one would need to explore much higher energies that those associated to the above cited constraints on @xmath5 dispersion relations .",
    "this is why we shall focus here on the physics of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) .",
    "it has been recently pointed out @xcite that if lorentz symmetry was violated , then the absorption of ultra - high - energy ( uhe ) photons ( @xmath35 ) on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and the universal radio background ( urb ) could be forbidden , thus leading to large photon fluxes reaching earth .",
    "this would violate limits put by current experiments @xcite on the photon fraction in uhecr .",
    "hence , very strong constraints @xmath36 and @xmath37 were claimed @xcite .",
    "an underlying assumption in @xcite is that @xmath38 in order to prevent competing reactions with respect to photon absorption .",
    "this is an important limitation , as we will show below .    the main result of this work is to extend the idea given in @xcite to the full lv qed framework described by equations ( [ eq : disp_rel_phot ] ) and ( [ eq : disp_rel_ferm ] ) .",
    "while the original constraints @xcite are weakened , we shall see that , when used together with other eft reactions , this method has the potentiality not only to basically rule out the @xmath5 case but also to strongly constrain , for the first time , the cpt - even ( hence possibly theoretically favored ) @xmath6 lv qed .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section [ sec : uhephotons ] we briefly describe the origin of the ultra - high - energy photons and explain the argument by @xcite . in section [ sec : lvreactions ]",
    "we describe the generalization of the previous argument in effective field theory lv . in section [ sec : constraints ] we discuss our results and draw conclusions .",
    "uhe photons originate in the interactions of uhecrs with the cmb , leading to the production of neutral pions which subsequently decay into photon pairs .",
    "pion production occurs only if the interacting uhecr energy is above @xmath39 ( @xmath40 is the target photon energy ) .",
    "hence , it has long been thought to be responsible for a cut off in the uhecr spectrum , the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cut - off @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the presence of a suppression of the uhecr flux has been confirmed only recently with the observations by the hires detector @xcite and the pierre auger observatory ( pao ) @xcite . although the cut off could be also due to the finite acceleration power of the uhecr sources , the fact that it occurs at the expected energy favors the gzk explanation .",
    "the results shown in @xcite further strengthen this hypothesis .",
    "the pao and the yakutsk and agasa experiments also imposed limits on the presence of photons in the uhecr spectrum .",
    "in particular , the photon fraction is less than 2.0% , 5.1% , 31% and 36% ( 95% c.l )  at @xmath41 , 20 , 40 , 100 eev respectively @xcite .",
    "although its theoretical computation is quite uncertain and depends on many unknowns related to source and propagation effects @xcite , it is established that photons are mainly attenuated by pair production onto cmb and urb .    however , pair production is strongly affected by lv . in particular , the ( lower ) threshold energy can be slightly shifted and in general an upper threshold ( a finite energy above which pair production is no more allowed by energy - momentum conservation )",
    "can be introduced @xcite .",
    "therefore , if the upper threshold energy happens to be lower than @xmath42 , then uhe photons are no more attenuated by the cmb and can reach the earth constituting a significant fraction of the total uhecr flux , thereby violating present experimental limits decay . ]",
    "@xcite .",
    "however , this argument is not stringent enough to cast constraints on lv in eft , because in this framework two competitive processes , forbidden in li physics , are allowed and can effectively dump the photon flux : photon decay in vacuum and photon splitting ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "in @xcite the special case @xmath44 and @xmath45 was considered , in order to prevent these extra processes . in",
    "the following we will study the full parameter space .",
    "in order to perform a consistent analysis in lv eft , we have to consider three processes related to photon attenuation : pair production , @xmath46-decay and photon splitting .",
    "pair production : :    this well known process occurs whenever the center - of - mass energy of    the @xmath47 system is sufficient to produce a    @xmath48 pair , i.e.  it is larger than    @xmath49 .",
    "this condition corresponds to    @xmath50 .",
    "+    in the following , we exploit the above mentioned relation    @xmath20 , as on    average the initial state is unpolarized ( see however @xcite for    further discussion on this point ) .",
    "this is justified as    @xmath51 decay produces photons with opposite    polarization and the cmb is unpolarized on average . moreover , the    interaction at threshold must occur in @xmath52-wave , because    the particles momenta need to be aligned @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is    possible that , if the @xmath52-wave channel is forbidden ,    higher partial mode interactions occur in off - threshold configuration .    in this case , however , the reaction rate is suppressed by partial mode    suppression and because only suitably polarized initial states can    contribute to it . within this framework , and exploiting    energy - momentum conservation , the kinematics equation governing pair    production is the following @xcite    @xmath53 where    @xmath54 and    @xmath55 are respectively    the photon s and electron s lv coefficients divided by powers of    @xmath10 , @xmath56 is the fraction of momentum    carried by either the electron or the positron with respect to the    momentum @xmath57 of the incoming high - energy photon and    @xmath40 is the energy of the target photon ( we will    assume in the following    @xmath58    and will not consider pair production onto the urb , as our main    conclusions can be drawn using just cmb ) .",
    "note that the symmetry of    ( [ eq : ggscat ] ) under the exchange    @xmath59 is manifested in its symmetry    under @xmath60 and    @xmath61 .",
    "pair    production can be severely affected by lv .",
    "in particular , it has been    shown @xcite that , rather surprisingly , not only the threshold energy    @xmath62 is modified , but also an upper threshold is    introduced .",
    "physically , this means that at sufficiently high momentum    the photon does not carry enough energy to create a pair and    simultaneously conserve energy and momentum .",
    "however , an upper    threshold can only be found in regions of the parameter space in which    the @xmath46-decay is forbidden , because if a single    photon is able to create a pair , then _ a fortiori _ two interacting    photons will do @xcite .",
    "the structure of the lower and upper    thresholds for @xmath63 has been studied in @xcite if    @xmath64 .",
    "the same kind of analysis can be    extended to the full eft case . however , being the computation rather    cumbersome , we shall evaluate it numerically .",
    "the structure of the    constraint is different depending on @xmath65 .",
    "if    @xmath66 , since    @xmath67 and the constraint is    imposed on both left and right polarized photons , it is symmetric with    respect to @xmath68 . if    @xmath32 such a symmetric structure is lost .",
    "@xmath46-decay : :    while forbidden in li theory , this reaction is allowed in a lv    framework if the photon energy is above a certain threshold . the    latter can be easily derived by solving the relative energy - momentum    conservation equation which can be readily inferred from ( [ eq : ggscat ] )    by noticing that it corresponds to the limit    @xmath69 .",
    "photon splitting : :    this is forbidden for @xmath70 while it is always    allowed if @xmath71 @xcite . when allowed , the    relevance of this process is simply related to its rate .",
    "the most    relevant cases are @xmath72 and    @xmath73 , because processes with more    photons in the final state are suppressed by more powers of the fine    structure constant .",
    "+    the @xmath74 process is forbidden    in qed because of kinematics and c - parity conservation . in lv",
    "eft    neither condition holds .",
    "however , we can argue that this process is    suppressed by an additional power of the planck mass , with respect to    @xmath75 .",
    "in fact , in li qed the    matrix element is zero due to the exact cancellation of fermionic and    anti - fermionic loops . in lv",
    "eft this cancellation is not exact and the    matrix element is expected to be proportional to at least    @xmath76 , @xmath77 , as it is    induced by lv and must vanish in the limit    @xmath78 .",
    "+    therefore , we have to deal only with    @xmath75 .",
    "this process has been    studied in @xcite . in particular , in @xcite it was found    that , if the `` effective photon mass ''    @xmath79 ,    then the splitting lifetime of a photon is approximately    @xmath80 ,    where @xmath81 is a phase space factor of order 1 .",
    "this rate    was rather higher than the one obtained via dimensional analysis in    @xcite because , due to integration of loop factors , additional    dimensionless contributions proportional to @xmath82    enhance the splitting rate at low energy .",
    "+    this analysis , however , does not apply to our case , because for    photons around @xmath83 ev    @xmath84 if    @xmath85 and    @xmath86 .",
    "hence the above mentioned loop    contributions are at most logarithmic , as the momentum circulating in    the fermionic loop is much larger than @xmath87 . moreover ,    in this regime the splitting rate depends only on    @xmath88 , the only energy scale present in the    problem .",
    "+    we then expect the analysis proposed in @xcite to be correct and we    infer that the splitting time scale at    @xmath89 is larger than the    propagation one ( 100 myr for gzk photons ) if    @xmath90 , while if @xmath6 it is well    above 100 myr even for @xmath91 .",
    "we have demonstrated so far that only @xmath46-decay and pair production are relevant to our analysis . by considering these processes three kinds of constraints",
    "are possible .",
    "on the one hand , since at present we have stringent upper bounds on photon fluxes up to @xmath92 ev @xcite , then any upper threshold energy introduced by lv in pair production must be larger than this figure .",
    "this leads to the constraint represented by the black thick solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : pair3 ] , where the allowed region is obviously the one including the origin and in the case @xmath5 is the intersection of the upper threshold allowed region with the ones allowed by already existing constraints ( red lines ) .",
    "we confirm the claim by @xcite that , for @xmath93 , @xmath36 and @xmath94 .",
    "however , fig .",

    ", the pao will reach the required sensitivity to probe such theoretically expected fluxes @xcite within the next few years @xcite . in this case the allowed region for @xmath5 would be the `` clepsydra '' delimited by the black solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : gdec ] and by the two horizontal red lines corresponding to the birefringence constraint . as it can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig : gdec ] , for @xmath5 the combination of the above mentioned constraints would cast the very strong bound @xmath95 .",

    "the best constraints to date are shown in red , if they exist.,title=\"fig : \" ]    finally , we notice that these two methods do not in principle exclude each other ( although the physical effects are mutually exclusive ) .",
    "this is the case if a lower limit to the photon flux at @xmath42 is imposed by the experiments ( thus implying the absence of @xmath46-decay ) , while the upper limit at @xmath92 ev is confirmed .",
    "the constraint obtained in this case would be very strong , as the allowed region is given by the intersection of the two regions bounded by the green dot - dashed and the black solid lines in fig .",
