    "the creation mechanism for interstellar shells of diameters larger than 300  pc continues to be debated .",
    "such sizes rule out that a single ( central ) stellar association can provide the energy ( the combined effect of sn explosions , stellar winds and radiation pressure ) to create such a supershell ( see tenorio - tagle & bodenheimer 1988 for a review ) .",
    "apparently much more energy is needed so that different formation mechanisms have been considered .    in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) meaburn and collaborators ( see e.g. meaburn 1980 )",
    "have identified nine supergiant shells ( sgss ) based on their filamentary ring - like structure on h@xmath7 plates .",
    "these sgss have diameters in the range of @xmath8kpc . the largest and best studied is lmc@xmath04 , which appears in the light of h@xmath7 as an ellipse of 1  kpc ( in e - w ) and 1.4  kpc diameter ( in n - s direction ) . in h@xmath0i",
    "it is a thick shell with a gas depleted central area ( see , e.g. , luks & rohlfs 1992 ; kim et al .",

    "recently efremov & elmegreen ( 1998 ) pointed out that this term was used for the wrong object .",
    "originally mckibben nail & shapley ( 1953 ) ` defined ' it to be a triple aggregation of @xmath9 area and to contain ngc@xmath01974 .",
    "so this name would not be appropriate for the lh@xmath077 region ( see fig .",
    "[ f_lmcsgslhsketch ] ) , but for the n@xmath051 region , containing lh@xmath063 , lh@xmath060 , and lh@xmath054 .",
    "thus we consider it best to avoid the ambiguous term sh@xmath10iii and to only use appropriate object names based on a clear naming convention , like lh@xmath11 ( lucke  & hodge 1970 ; lucke 1972 ) , n@xmath11 ( henize 1956 ) , or lmc@xmath04 ( goudis  & meaburn 1978 ) .    = 8.4 cm    since the identification of lmc@xmath04 as sgs , several photometric investigations have been carried out .",
    "these aimed , in part , at finding the age of the stars inside lmc@xmath04 and at its rim with the goal of tracing the history of the sgs .",

    "the small difference in age between the interior and the edge of lmc@xmath04 makes it likely that the stars near the h@xmath7 emission were formed as a result of the events taking place inside the sgs .",
    "however , the sheer volume of space interior to lmc@xmath04 containing stars of the same age makes lmc@xmath04 a truly exceptional area .    in the present study",
    "we have compiled the data and the results on ages and population structure for the lmc@xmath04 area .",
    "we also add some new photometry , consisting of three fields near the centre covering a total of @xmath12 .",
    "the overall data are analysed to find further clues to the origin of the sgs lmc@xmath04 .",
    "various mechanisms have been proposed for the formation of lmc@xmath04 .",
    "these include the collision with a high - velocity h@xmath0i cloud ( hvc ) , the stochastic self - propagating star formation ( sspsf ) , the triggering of star cluster arcs , and the lmc bow - shock as star formation trigger .",

    "[ ss_evoaftbrst ] ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath91myr after the giant central volume formed stars , the edge was pushed into star formation mode , too .",
    "one is thus faced with several questions pertaining to the origin of the structure called lmc@xmath04 .",
    "what mechanism can stimulate _ simultaneous _ star formation over an area ( in a volume ) with projected size of about @xmath92pc ( the interior of lmc@xmath04 ) ? by what mechanism was the gas of the birth cloud dispersed so efficiently to create the presently low column densities in the hi over such an area ? what stimulated the star formation at the outskirts of this area ( creating the h@xmath7 structure called lmc@xmath93 ) in a relatively homogeneous manner ?",
    "several star formation scenarios possibly leading to the formation of supergiant shells are mentioned in the literature . here",
    "we will comment on each in relation with our knowledge of lmc@xmath04 .",
    "an infalling high - velocity cloud might compress the gas in the lmc disk and so trigger star formation .",
    "infall would affect star formation in a large region indeed and we see that the ages derived for the large inner part of lmc@xmath04 are equal ( see sect .",
    "[ s_photdat ] ) .",
    "however , the data about the density and radial velocity of lmc@xmath04 gas contradict this scenario ( domgrgen et al .",
    "1995 ) , and infall was not the actual trigger for the formation of lmc@xmath04 .",
    "in addition , given the motion of the lmc through the halo of the milky way ( kroupa & bastian 1997 ) , the velocity of such a hvc should have been rather orthogonal to that of the lmc itself , thus having a velocity vector pointing more or less toward the sun .",
    "a hvc moving away from the milky way is very unlikely .",
    "hvcs moving toward the milky way at @xmath94 and @xmath95 are known in this direction ( savage & de boer 1979 ) . since this high velocity gas is seen over the entire face of the lmc ( see savage & de boer 1981 ) , with the lmc at @xmath96 , it is rather nearby .",
    "in the stochastic self - propagating star formation scenario the stars formed initially trigger further star formation in their vicinity .",
    "sspsf leads to an age gradient from the starting point , e.g. the centre of a sgs , outward to the rim ( feitzinger et al .",
    "it has been a popular model and was often cited in papers about supershells in distant galaxies where no photometry of individual stars is available .",
    "the predictions by sspsf for the morphology of sgss agree with the observed density and radial velocity of gas in the interior of lmc@xmath04 .",
    "however , the large radius of the sgs would lead to a continuous age spread of the stars of at least 15  myr range .",
    "even if one takes a possible overlap of stellar populations having different ages into account , the photometric data are in contradiction with such a population structure and thus indicate incompatibility of the sspsf scenario with the interior of lmc@xmath04 .",
    "this has now been sufficiently noted ( see braun et al .",
    "1997 ; dolphin & hunter 1998 ) .",
    "star clusters or @xmath97-ray bursts may trigger star formation to form arc like structures .",
    "= 8.4 cm    efremov & elmegreen ( 1998 ) suggested as trigger for star formation in lmc@xmath04 the self - gravitational collapse of parts of rims from shells initially driven by star clusters , leading to the building of star cluster arcs .",
    "they identify three of these structures ( see fig .  [ f_lmc4arcs ] ) , circular ( in the 2d projection ) in shape , and this may indicate that they have been formed by swept - up material .",
    "efremov et al .",
    "( 1998 ) subsequently suggested that gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) may produce the pressurizing wave .",
    "these suggestions are rather _ ad hoc_. moreover , they would create localized structures and nothing of the kind like lmc@xmath04 .",
    "the collapse into a cluster or the explosion of a grb , formation of a shell of swept up material which itself forms stars , which then leads to a next shell or the acceleration of the old shell ( the scenario for the ` quadrant ' and subsequently for lmc@xmath04 after efremov & elmegreen 1998 ) may explain some features , but not the entire sgs with the documented age structure ( see sect .",
    "[ s_agestruc ] ) .",
    "furthermore it is hard to explain why ` quadrant ' is coeval ( braun et al .",
    "1997 ) while ` sextant ' shows a clear age gradient ( petr et al . 1994 ) if the same mechanism would be valid .",
    "the geometry of the ( after efremov & fargion 2000 ) four cluster arcs are rather due to cloud structure long _ before _ star formation than being directly connected to the formation process .",
    "= 8.4 cm      the motion of the lmc through the milky way halo leads to a bow - shock triggering star formation .",
    "since a very large area created stars at the same time , and since ( due of the rotation of the lmc ) the present day lmc@xmath04 was near the leading edge about 15  myr ago , the bow - shock of the lmc may have triggered the conditions for large - scale star formation .",
    "searching for a possible creation mechanism of supergiant shell lmc@xmath04 and maybe of all the supershells of the large magellanic cloud , one finds that the superstructures of the lmc ( see fig .  [ f_lmcsgslhsketch ] ) are all located at the outskirts .",
    "looking at these features clockwise from south - east to north - west , the expected correlation of age with traversed distance is visible ( see de boer et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the scenario has as essential part the motion of the lmc through the galactic halo and the lmcs clockwise rotation .",
    "the gas of the lmc rotates through the compression zone at the south - east , to eventually find itself in the north - east ( lmc@xmath04 ) with all the consequences of the star formation triggered inside that gas .",
    "in the review of the scenarios above we have indicated that the first three are not compatible with the observational facts .",
    "the most important fact is that over the entire interior of lmc@xmath04 star formation burst out on a large scale about @xmath98myr ago ( see table  [ t_lmc4clitdat ] and sects .",
    "[ s_photdat ] and [ s_agestruc ] ) .",
    "small stellar associations can not be used as trigger for large - scale structures and there is no evidence for a recent collision with a hvc .",
    "the bow - shock formation scenario is the only viable one .",
    "note that the bow - shock scenario explains only the formation of large structures around the edge of the lmc . at any given",
    "location in the lmc star formation continues as is readily visible from the ubiquitous h@xmath7 structures everywhere in the lmc .",
    "after formation of the original cloud of stars these stars emitted their energy into the surroundings , driving the gas out of this region rather more in a turbulent than a pressurized manner . the total energy produced by the massive stars , ( stellar winds , ionizing photons , and supernova explosions ) went into ionizing and expansion of the original birth cloud .",
    "these aspects have been discussed by braun et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and by dolphin & hunter ( 1998 ) and are not repeated here .",
    "after the formation of this 1st generation of stars , star formation was initiated at the edge of the central region , creating populations of younger ages visible by the h@xmath0ii regions surrounding this sgs .",
    "examples for these stellar populations are lh@xmath063 , lh@xmath060 and lh@xmath054 ( petr et al . 1994 ) , situated in the n@xmath051 region , and lh@xmath076 ( wilcots et al .",

    "this phase with the formation of stars at the outskirts of the original cloud affects only regions of small size ( i.e. @xmath99pc ) as expected from the limits due to inhomogenity ( density , temperature , magnetic fields etc . ) of the medium .      the convergence of gas near the bow - shock , due to the lmc space motion combined with the lmcs rotation ( see de boer et al .",
    "1998 ) creates a large and condensing gas cloud . in it star formation sets in , and the rotation of the lmc moves this region around the edge in clock - wise fashion .",
    "the role of ram - pressure , especially the comparison of strength of hydrodynamic and gravitational effects , is still uncertain .",
    "observational findings like x - ray shadowing ( blondiau et al . 1997 ) , the steep edge in h@xmath0i near the location of the largest velocity with respect to the halo gas ( see e.g. the map by kim et al . 1999 ) , and h@xmath7 emission of some main components of the magellanic stream ( weiner & williams 1996 ) are all indications for bow - shocks due to motion of magellanic material through halo gas . to fit the h@xmath0i maps of the stream and other structures , recent models for the tidal interactions of the magellanic clouds ( mcs )",
    "are extended by a drag term ( gardiner 1999 ) , accounting for the motion of the mcs through the milky way halo .",
    "however , problems remain and not all inconsistencies are solved ( see e.g. moore & davis 1994 and murali 2000 ) .",
    "the shape of the dark cloud presently seen south of 30 dor is elongated , oriented perpendicular to the direction of the rotation centre of the lmc .",
    "the most dense region of stars inside lmc@xmath04 , being the hatched region in fig .",
    "[ f_lmcsgslhsketch ] with the embedded smaller associations lh@xmath065 and lh@xmath084 , has the same orientation .",
    "we note that at their radial distance from the centre ( both at approximately 2  kpc ) the lmc rotation curve is rather level , and rotation will hardly change the original shape of structures .    since the density of the lmc drops radially outward , it is to be expected that older sgss will have opened up to the lmc edge .",
    "the morphology of the h@xmath7 distribution may therefore give further evidence for the expected age sequence of the sgss .",
    "continuing in clockwise direction , the supergiant shell lmc@xmath05 to the east of lmc@xmath04 is still complete , while lmc@xmath06 is a non - contiguous ring .",
    "note also , that the star density in lmc@xmath04 drops outward and that lmc@xmath04 is elongated toward the lower density on the outside .",
    "apart from the young stars in lmc@xmath04 older populations are present .",
    "these may date from a previous burst , of one or more revolutions ago .",
    "such earlier events will have left numerous earlier generations . however",
    ", a bow - shock triggered burst need not take place continuously , since apparently gas accumulates intermittantly and the power of the trigger is sensitive to the current halo density at the front of the lmc .",
    "if it were continous , one would see a continuous ring of young stars around the lmc s edge .",
    "the age of small - scale structures may or may not be related to the age of the large - scale structures such as lmc@xmath04 .",
    "one full rotation of the lmc edge takes @xmath100myr so that larger older structures may be part and/or consequence of a previous large - scale event .",
    "looking at other dwarf galaxies in h@xmath7 or h@xmath0i , one recognizes that supershells are quite common features in galaxies and especially in dwarf galaxies ( e.g. brinks & walter 1998 ) , where the symmetry is not disturbed by differential rotation .",
    "however the different environment of these galaxies , such as tidal forces from neighbouring galaxies or being completely isolated , makes it difficult to explain these supershells by the same creation mechanism as the supergiant shells in the magellanic clouds .",
    "still , in such galaxies larger volumes of space must attract sufficient amounts of gas in dense form that a starburst takes place , setting off star formation nearly simultaneous in huge volumes .",
    "clearly , photometric studies of resolved stellar populations in more distant ( dwarf ) galaxies are needed to achieve a general picture on these large - scale star forming processes .",
    "the photometry of large areas inside lmc@xmath04 shows that the stars are of the same age , being @xmath101myr .",
    "the rotation speed of the lmc makes clear that the lmc@xmath04 region was at time 0 near the bow - shock . at",
    "the bow - shock one currently finds a huge dark cloud being in the process of forming stars . combining these two observational facts led to the bow - shock scenario and",
    "further evidence has been brought forward to substantiate this scenario .",
    "observing the interior of further supergiant shells will provide clearer insight in the formation history of the star groups inside such structures . except for the complicated 30@xmath0dor region ( with the neighbouring supergiant shells",
    "lmc@xmath02 and lmc@xmath03 ) all other sgss should show a coeval large - scale stellar population fitting to the age sequence proposed by the bow - shock scenario . were this found to be not so , then the bow - shock trigger model would be falsified .",
    "one then would be in need of finding another star formation trigger . given the current observations the only other possible ( however unlikely ) scenario would then be a special hvc collision .",
    "as yet , the bow - shock induced star formation fits the available observational data best .",
