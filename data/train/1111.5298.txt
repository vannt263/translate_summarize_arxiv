    "according to fractional calculus the harmonic oscillator is a particular case of the fractional oscillator @xcite .",
    "it suffices to say that the fractional oscillator equation is a generalization of the classical harmonic equation by replacing the second - order derivative by a fractional one .",
    "if the harmonic oscillator is described by elementary harmonic functions , the fractional oscillator solution is expressed in terms of mittag - leffler functions .",
    "the interrelation between these oscillators has clarified with the consideration of temporal subordination .",
    "then the development of an oscillatory process is governed by its own internal clock ( operational time ) that is not synchronized with physical ( deterministic ) clock @xcite . as has been shown in @xcite that the fractional oscillator results from an ensemble average of harmonic oscillations under stochastic time arrow .",
    "in fact , the fractional oscillator can be considered as a time - clock randomization ( subordination ) of the conventional harmonic oscillator .",
    "the new time clock is the continuous limit of the discrete counting process , when the time variable is a sum of random temporal intervals belonging to an @xmath0-stable distribution .",
    "hence there exists a direct correspondence between the functions of both oscillators .",
    "in particular , the cosine function @xmath1 is connected with the one - parameter mittag - leffler function @xmath2 .",
    "its features has been studied in detail ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein )",
    ". passing to the limit @xmath3 , this mittag - leffler function transforms to @xmath1 .",
    "one of very interesting properties of the one - parameter mittag - leffler function is a finite number of zeros .",
    "therefore , the function has a finite number of damped oscillations with an algebraic decay . for completeness",
    "it is necessary to investigate also the `` sine '' correspondence of fractional oscillations .",
    "the function is briefly mentioned in  @xcite without any detailed analysis . in this connection",
    "it should be pointed out that the displacement of harmonic oscillator and its momentum are written by means of ordinary harmonic functions .",
    "similar values ( displacement and momentum ) may be formulated for fractional oscillator too .",
    "their consideration is of great interest .",
    "they are just expressed in terms of mittag - leffler functions mentioned above .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study their features in the context of fractional oscillator .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ par2 ]",
    "we start our analysis with the time - clock randomization of the ordinary harmonic oscillator .",
    "this allows us to use the integral relation between the harmonic functions and the mittag - leffler functions of the fractional oscillator .",
    "our main interest will be focused on the mittag - leffler function having the sine function as a limit .",
    "next we investigate its properties in section  [ par3 ] and derive a fractional differential equation for which this function is its solution ( section  [ par4 ] ) . as a comparison , the `` cosine '' correspondence of fractional oscillations will be given simultaneously .",
    "section  [ par5 ] is devoted to a consideration of fractional oscillation zeros .",
    "if one randomizes the time clock in accordance with @xcite , the fractional oscillations are written by means of @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the mittag - leffler function , @xmath7 the gamma function , and @xmath8 determines the probability to be at the internal time @xmath9 on the real time @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 denotes the bromwich path ( a line @xmath12 with a value @xmath13 ) , and @xmath14 .    since the function",
    "@xmath15 has been reviewed in @xcite , we devote our attention more to the function @xmath16 .",
    "the latter has a laplace inversion integral @xmath17 the fractional oscillations exist for @xmath18 .",
    "it is that the case is of interest to us and will be discussed below .",
    "fractional one - half - order integral of the exponential function , @xmath19.,width=12 ]    for convenience one puts @xmath20 , then one denotes @xmath16 as @xmath21 . it should be pointed out that for @xmath20 the function @xmath15 is equal to @xmath22 according to the notations of @xcite . as the laplace image of the function @xmath23 is @xmath24 , it is easy to determine the relation between @xmath22 and @xmath21 via the fractional integral of @xmath25 order , namely @xmath26 recall that for @xmath27 the function @xmath22 takes the form @xmath28 define the same in reference to the function @xmath21 for @xmath27 . at once it is obvious that @xmath29 . using the efros theorem",
    ", we find @xmath30 via the laplace image @xmath31 note that @xmath32 is the imaginary error function @xcite .",
    "it is a real - valued , entire function defined by @xmath33 . in contrast to the ordinary error function @xmath34 , the imaginary error function is not bounded , but the function @xmath30 is bounded .",
    "it tends to zero in the limit @xmath35 .",
    "moreover , the latter is very close to the dawson s integral @xmath36 @xcite . in this connection it should be mentioned the asymptotic behavior of the imaginary error function @xmath37 it may be advantageous for the estimation of @xmath30 with @xmath38 . to sum up above",
    "is the numerical simulation of @xmath30 represented in fig .",
    "the next important step consists in the decomposition @xmath21 into two contributions . for this purpose",
    "we bow the bromwich path of integration into the equivalent hankel path .",
    "then the loop will start from minus infinity along the lower side of negative real axis , encircle @xmath39 counter - clockwise and end at minus infinity along the upper side of the negative real axis .",
    "the first contribution arises from two borders of the cut negative real axis .",
    "taking @xmath40 along the upper border and @xmath41 along the lower border , we get @xmath42 with @xmath43 the part @xmath44 is not completely monotonic , as the function @xmath45 takes on both positive and negative values ( see theorem  7 in @xcite ) .",
    "it becomes vanishingly small with @xmath10 tending to infinity .",
    "the second contribution is calculated by means of residues .",
    "the poles @xmath46 and @xmath47 give @xmath48.\\ ] ] this part clearly demonstrates an oscillatory character . due to",
    "it , the oscillatory behavior is carried over to the function @xmath21 itself .",
    "fractional oscillations for @xmath49.,width=12 ]    it is useful to remark that the functions @xmath21 resembles @xmath22 .",
    "so for @xmath18 the function @xmath22 also consists of two parts , @xmath50 . from @xcite",
    "it follows that the monotonic part is @xmath51 where @xmath52 according to @xcite , the function @xmath53 is complete monotonic .",
    "the second contribution of @xmath22 takes the oscillatory form @xmath54.\\ ] ] to have a clear idea of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , their pictures are represented in fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the first approach to fractional oscillations had enough a formal character .",
    "it proceeded from the simple change of the second derivative in the harmonic oscillator equation to the derivative of a fractional one .",
    "in other words , such a equation was postulated . after solving it the fractional oscillation features were established .",
    "nevertheless , there is an alternative way to fractional calculus @xcite .",
    "the probabilistic point of view shows that the derivative of fractional order is connected with @xmath0-stable probability distributions @xcite .",
    "starting from the analysis of stochastic random processes , this permits ones to derive the fractional differential equations responsible for fractional oscillations . here",
    "we intend to give new examples demonstrating this approach .",
    "let the sign @xmath55 be for the juxtaposition of a function depending on @xmath10 with its laplace image depending on @xmath56 , namely @xmath57 the reader is reminded that @xmath58 if the laplace image is written as @xmath59 the expression @xmath60 is treated by a ( fractional ) integral equation after the laplace transform . since @xmath61 , from the laplace inversion we find @xmath62 according to @xcite , the definition of fractional derivative is @xmath63 taking the positive integer number @xmath64 with @xmath65 . in fact , @xmath66 is the @xmath64-derivative under the integral @xmath67 .",
    "then the function @xmath22 satisfies also the equivalent equation in the differential form @xmath68 it should be pointed out , though this equation was known earlier , it was not derived but postulated . using the approach ,",
    "now we intend to derive an equation describing @xmath21 .    in order to obtain the equation for @xmath21 ,",
    "we need to consider its laplace image @xmath69 the initial condition is @xmath70 .",
    "thus , the corresponding equation becomes @xmath71 it is interesting to observe that following the argument of @xcite , the generalized momentum of the fractional oscillator takes the form @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the displacement , @xmath74 the circular frequency , @xmath64 the generalized mass .",
    "to put it in another way , the momentum is expressed in terms of @xmath75 .",
    "really , expanding @xmath22 and @xmath21 in an infinite power series about @xmath76 and differentiating the functions by @xmath77 with respect to @xmath10 , we obtain @xmath78 whereas @xmath79 consequently , eq.([eq4 ] ) is reduced to @xmath80 the form of this equation coincides with eq.([eq3 ] ) .",
    "thus , the functions @xmath22 and @xmath21 represent two independent solutions of the same equation .",
    "moreover , this permits one to derive the equation of fractional oscillator by means of the hamilton formalism with some alterations .",
    "so the generalized hamiltonian is written as @xmath81 it corresponds to the total energy of the fractional oscillator @xcite . in the hamilton form",
    "the motion equation of fractional oscillator becomes @xmath82 the modification of the conventional representation of the hamilton equations is conditioned on a random interaction of the system of harmonic oscillators with environment .",
    "each harmonic oscillator is governed by its own internal clock .",
    "although its dynamics is described by the ordinary hamiltonian equations , @xmath83 and @xmath84 depend on the operational time .",
    "the passage from the operational time to the physical time via the averaging procedure accounts for the interaction of the system of harmonic oscillators with environment .",
    "this results in this system on the whole behaving as a fractional oscillator .",
    "the momentum of the fractional oscillator and its displacement take the integral form @xmath85 therefore , the fractional oscillator is an ensemble average of harmonic oscillations ( see details in @xcite ) .",
    "although the hamiltonian ( [ eq4a ] ) is not an explicit function of time , for non - integer values @xmath0 the dynamic system is nonconservative because of the fractional derivative of momentum .    as is well known @xcite , the laplace images are also useful for finding an asymptotic behavior of transformed functions . with this in mind",
    "we expand the term @xmath86 in a series with respect to @xmath56 .",
    "this technique works finely for the solutions of linear fractional differential equations @xcite . taking the leading terms",
    ", we obtain the asymptotic representations as @xmath35 , namely @xmath87 for @xmath18 the denominator @xmath88 is less than zero , whereas @xmath89 .",
    "it is easy to show that the asymptotic algebraic decay of @xmath22 and @xmath21 is completely determined by the parts @xmath53 and @xmath44 , respectively ( see section  [ par3 ] ) . in the classical case @xmath90 the contributions @xmath53 and @xmath44 are equal to zero exactly , because there is only a pole , and the cut on the negative real axis is no longer present .",
    "the fractional oscillations occupy a special place in the oscillatory theory and what is why . on the one hand",
    ", they have a decay like a relaxation .",
    "on the other hand they show themselves as oscillations .",
    "asymptotically the fractional oscillations become vanishingly small with @xmath35 .",
    "however , the feature has a deep cornerstone .",
    "their representation in the form of two contributions is especially important .",
    "the decomposition manifests a competition between two different dependencies .",
    "the harmonic oscillation exponentially decays on the background of a slow algebraic relaxation .",
    "although at the beginning the oscillations prevail , the algebraic decay will survive them . as a result ,",
    "the fractional oscillations have a finite number of damped oscillations as well as zeros .",
    "consider the problem in greater detail .",
    "probably , wiman was the first who has described the position of the mittag - leffler function zeros in the complex plane @xcite .",
    "a finite number of the zeros has been established .",
    "later the analysis was specified in @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath22 demonstrates an odd number of zeros .",
    "the smallest zero lies in the interval @xmath91 $ ] .",
    "the number of zeros strictly depends on the index @xmath0 .",
    "increasing @xmath0 more and more , we get more the number of zeros in the function @xmath22 . for @xmath92",
    "the only zero is located in infinity .",
    "when @xmath0 tends from 1 to 2 , the number of zeros increases so that for @xmath90 their number becomes equal to infinity .",
    "we provide a similar analysis to the function @xmath21 .",
    "it is not evident that the function has a finite number of zeros for @xmath18 .",
    "at once it should be noticed that this function always is zero for @xmath93 under any value of @xmath94 .",
    "when @xmath10 is enough large , the zeros of @xmath21 are expected to be found approximately from the equation @xmath95 neglecting the oscillation factor in the contribution @xmath96 .",
    "putting now @xmath97 , the first - order approximation gives @xmath98\\sim\\cos[\\pi(1-\\varepsilon)]\\sim -1\\,.\\ ] ] thus , the asymptotic position @xmath99 of the largest zero is defined by the relation @xmath100 which shows that @xmath99 tends to infinity as @xmath101 .",
    "the function @xmath102 has infinitely many zeros .",
    "now let the index @xmath0 be @xmath103 . in the limit of the first - order approximation",
    "we can write @xmath104\\sim\\cos[(\\pi/2)(1+\\delta/2)]= \\sin(\\pi\\delta/4)\\sim\\pi\\delta/4\\ ] ] and @xmath105 in this case the asymptotic estimation for the largest zero @xmath99 reduces to the equation @xmath106 from which one gets @xmath107 since @xmath108 , the value @xmath99 tends to infinity faster than @xmath109 .",
    "moreover , the terms @xmath110 and @xmath111 are of the same order . taking either @xmath112 or @xmath113 , where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are positive constants to be determined , we arrive at @xmath116 .",
    "the equivalent asymptotic expressions are @xmath117 in the limit @xmath3 the period of @xmath96 becomes @xmath118 .",
    "consequently the number of zeros of @xmath21 tends to @xmath119 as @xmath108 .",
    "we have considered the fractional oscillations allied with ordinary harmonic ones .",
    "the main feature of the fractional oscillations is that they have a finite number of zeros .",
    "this follows from the competition of two terms .",
    "one of them has an asymptotic behavior with an algebraic decay , and the other term contains a conventional harmonic oscillation vanishing in time because of an exponential decay .",
    "the second term decreases faster than this happens for the term with an algebraic decay .",
    "this important peculiarity of fractional oscillations is just reflected on the title of the paper .",
    "the analysis supports a key role of mittag - leffler functions .",
    "the fractional oscillations satisfy a linear fractional differential equation .",
    "we have derived it , using the method of the laplace transform .",
    "our analytical solutions are confirmed by a numerical treatment .",
