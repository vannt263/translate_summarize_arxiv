    "the utility of weak- and strong - coupling expansions and of dualities in nearly all branches of physics can hardly be overestimated .",
    "this article is devoted to several inter - related fundamental questions .",
    "mainly : ( 1 ) what information does the existence of finite order complementary weak- and strong - coupling series expansion of given physical quantities ( e.g. , partition functions , matrix elements , etc . ) provide ?",
    "( 2 ) to what extent can dualities be employed to _ partially solve _ those various problems ? by _ partial solvability _ , we mean the ability to compute a specific physical quantity with complexity polynomial in the size of the system , given partial information that is determined by other means .",
    "as we will demonstrate in this work , a universal problem deeply binds to the above two inquiries , and raises the critical question ( 3 ) why do numerous dualities in very different fields always turn out to be _ conformal transformations _ ? to set the stage , we briefly recall general notions concerning dualities .",
    "consider a theory of ( dimensionless ) coupling strength @xmath3 for which weak- and strong - coupling expansions may , respectively , be performed in powers of @xmath3 and @xmath4 or in other monotonically increasing / decreasing functions @xmath5 .",
    "common wisdom asserts that as ordinary expansion parameters ( e.g. , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) behave very differently , weak- and strong - coupling series can not , generally , be simply compared . on a deeper level , if these expansions describe different phases ( as they generally do ) then the series must become non - analytic ( in the thermodynamic limit ) at finite values of @xmath3 ( where transitions occur ) and thus render any equality between them void .",
    "a duality may offer insightful _",
    "information _ on a strong coupling theory by relating it to a system at weak coupling that may be perturbatively examined .",
    "as is well known , when they are present , self - dualities are manifest as an equivalence of the coefficients in the two different series ; this leads to an invariance under an inversion that is qualitatively ( and in standard field theories , e.g. , qed / electroweak / qcd is exactly ) of the canonical form `` @xmath6 '' ( or , more generally , @xmath7 ) .",
    "for example , in vacuum qed with lagrangian density @xmath8 $ ] , the ratio @xmath9 of the couplings in front of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 terms relates to a @xmath12 reciprocity .",
    "this reciprocity is evident from the invariance of maxwell s equations in vacuum under the exchange of electric and magnetic fields @xcite , @xmath13 and the lagrangian density that results . in yang - mills ( ym ) theories , such an exchange between dual fields has led to profound insights from analogies between the meissner effect and the behavior of vortices in superconductors to confinement and flux tubes  a hallmark of qcd @xcite .",
    "abstractions of dualities in electromagnetism and in ym theories produced powerful tools such as those in hodge and donaldson theories @xcite .    in both classical and quantum models , dualities ( and the @xmath7 inversion ) are generated by _ linear transformations _ ( appearing , e.g. , as unitary transformations or more general isometries relating one local theory to another in fundamental `` bond - algebraic '' @xcite incarnations or , in the standard case , fourier transformations @xcite ) .",
    "such linear transformations lead to an _ effective _ inversion of the coupling constant @xmath3 .",
    "dual models share , for instance , their partition functions ( and thus the same series expansion ) .",
    "as realized by kramers and wannier ( kw ) @xcite , self - dualities provide structure that enables additional information allowing , for instance , the exact computation of phase transition points .",
    "this does not imply that the full partition function is determined with complexity polynomial in the size of the system , that is , it is _ solvable _ via self - dualities _ alone _ ( and indeed as we illustrate in this work , self - dualities do not suffice ) .",
    "now here is a main point  that concerning question ( 3 )  which we wish to highlight in this article . in diverse arenas , the weak- and strong - coupling expansion parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 _",
    "are related to one another via conformal transformations _ that are of the fractional linear type . amongst many others ,",
    "prevalent examples are afforded by @xmath16 dualities in ym theories as well as those in ising models and ising lattice gauge theories . in all of these examples ,",
    "the transformations linking @xmath17 to @xmath18 are particular special cases of conformal ( or fractional linear ( mbius ) ) transformations .",
    "that is , in these , @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 complex coefficients , and determinant @xmath22    a well known mathematical property of fractional linear maps is their composition property : given any two fractional linear functions @xmath23 ( with @xmath24 ) , direct substitution demonstrates that @xmath25 ( i.e. , yet another fractional linear transformation ) where @xmath26 this group multiplication property will be of great utility in our analysis of dualities .",
    "fractional linear maps , as is commonly known by virtue of the trivial equality ( valid when @xmath27 ) @xmath28 which may be expressed as compositions of transformations of the ( formal ) forms : translation ( @xmath29 ) , scaling / rotation ( @xmath30 ) , and inversion ( @xmath31 ) . as each of these individual operations generally map circles and lines onto themselves so do the general transformations of eq .",
    "( [ circle ] ) .",
    "this may be understood as a consequence of a projective transformation from the riemann sphere onto the complex plane .",
    "relating lorentz transformations to mbius transformations is one of the principal ideas underlying twistor theory @xcite . envisioning _",
    "standard dualities _",
    "@xcite as particular induced maps on the euclidean @xmath32 sphere will be an outcome of the current work .",
    "the set of all conformal self - mappings of the upper half complex plane forms a group , with @xmath16 a subgroup ( `` full modular group '' ) that consists of all the fractional linear transformations with @xmath20 and @xmath21 integers , and determinant @xmath33 . in the aforementioned ym theories , e.g. , @xcite",
    ", an @xmath16 structure follows from a canonical invariance of the form @xmath34 ( stemming from charge quantization ) . as we will detail in the current work , in ising models and ising gauge theories , a canonical form of the duality",
    "is given by @xmath35 the transformation of eq .",
    "( [ mobius ] ) may trivially be associated to one with @xmath36 @xcite by a uniform scaling @xmath37 which does not change the ratio in eq .",
    "( [ abcd ] ) .",
    "more widely , any fractional linear transformation of the form of eq .",
    "( [ abcd ] ) with a finite determinant may similarly be related to one with @xmath36 by a uniform scaling of all four elements of the matrix . in general , we are interested in duality mappings as applied to matrix elements , partition functions or path integrals , while the typical scenario in ym theories focuses on mappings of the action ( or hamiltonian ) .    in what will follow",
    ", we will first address question ( 3 ) and illustrate that disparate duality transformations must be of the form of eq .",
    "( [ abcd ] ) . when applied to the expansion parameters",
    ", we will then demonstrate that these _ fractional linear maps lead to linear constraints between the strong- and weak - coupling series coefficients_. a main message of this work is that these conformal transformations of eq .",
    "( [ abcd ] ) , leading to linear relations among series coefficients , will allow a broad investigation of questions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) above .",
    "specifically , we will examine arbitrarily large yet _ finite size _",
    "systems for which _ no _ phase transitions appear . as is well known , _",
    "analyticity enables a full determination of functions _ over entire domains given their values in only a far more restricted regime ( even if only of vanishing measure ) . for a finite size system , the weak - coupling ( w - c ) and strong - coupling ( s - c ) expansions describe the same analytic function and are everywhere convergent and",
    "may thus be equated to one another .",
    "thus , a trivial yet practical consequence is , contrary to some lore , that _ the naturally perturbative w - c and the seemingly more involved s - c expansions are equally hard_. we will apply this approach to the largest ising model systems for which the exact expansions are known to data on both finite size cubic and square lattices .",
    "we further test other aspects of our methods on ising and generalized wegner models .",
    "the substitution of eq .",
    "( [ abcd ] ) relates the w - c and s - c expansion parameters in general dual models .",
    "we will more generally : ( 1 ) equate the w - c and s - c expansions to find _ linear constraints _ on the expansion coefficients , and ( 2 ) when possible , invoke self - duality to obtain yet further linear equations that those coefficients need to satisfy .",
    "this analysis will lead to the concept of _ partial solvability _ : the linear equations that we will obtain will enable us to _ localize np hardness _ of finding the exact partition function coefficients ( or other quantities ) to that of evaluating only a fraction of these coefficients . the remainder of these coefficients can be then trivially found by the linear relations that are derived from the duality of eq .",
    "( [ abcd ] ) .",
    "a highly non - trivial consequence of our work is that of _ relating mathematical identities to dualities _ such as those broadly generated by eq .",
    "( [ abcd ] ) .",
    "specifically , as a concrete example in this work , we will illustrate how the relations that we obtain connecting the w - c and s - c expansions lead to _ new combinatorial geometry equalities _ in general dimensions .",
    "as a particular example we will do this by noting that , in ising and generalized wegner models , the expansion coefficients are equal to the number of geometrical shapes of a given magnitude of the @xmath21-dimensional surface areas .",
    "the equality between the w - c and s - c expansions then lead to identities connecting these numbers .",
    "for the ising , ising gauge , and several other theories that we study in this work , the mapping between the w - c and s - c coupling expansion parameters is afforded by the particular mbius transformation @xmath38 associated with eq .",
    "( [ mobius ] ) .",
    "this transformation trivially satisfies babbage s equation @xmath39 for all @xmath40 . for self - dual models , such as the @xmath41 ising model or @xmath42",
    "ising gauge theories , we can easily find the critical ( self - dual ) point , @xmath43 , by solving the equation @xmath44 .",
    "we will term theories obeying eq .",
    "( [ ffz ] ) as those that exhibit a `` one- '' duality . in general",
    ", one may find such transformations , represented by a function @xmath45 , in terms of some parameter @xmath40 ( a coupling constant which can be complex - valued ) .",
    "richer transformations appear in diverse arenas including renormalization group ( rg ) calculations . based on these considerations we may have @xmath46 more general transformations @xmath47 may yield linear equations in a manner identical to those appearing for the ising theories studied in the current work .",
    "expansion parameters @xmath40 in self - dual theories satisfy @xmath48 ; this yields a _",
    "constraint on all possible self - dualities_. solutions are afforded by fractional linear ( conformal ) maps @xmath49 with the determinant of eq .",
    "( [ deteq ] ) being non - zero , @xmath50 . as we will further expand on elsewhere , another related duality appearing in ising and all potts models is given by @xmath51 with determinant @xmath52 such that @xmath53 is satisfied .",
    "in fact , as we will next establish in section [ proof - section ] , all  two- \" dualities satisfying eq .",
    "( [ f1f2 ] ) must be of the form of eqs .",
    "( [ f1f2-conformal ] ) .",
    "specifically , all duality mappings that can be made meromorphic by a change of variables , _ can only be of the fractional linear type_. this _ uniqueness _ may rationalize the appearance of fractional linear ( dual ) maps in disparate arenas ranging from statistical mechanics models , such as the ones that we study here , to s - dualities in , e.g. , ym theories .",
    "thus far , we focused on `` one- '' and `` two - dualities '' for which the coupling constants satisfy either eq .",

    "( [ f1f2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "our calculations may be extended to `` @xmath54-duality '' transformations for which @xmath55 as the reader may verify , replicating the considerations invoked in the next section leads to the conclusion that if they are meromorphic each of the functions @xmath56 ( with @xmath57 ) in eq .",

    "this thus shows that @xmath67 . in other words ,",
    "( [ ffz ] ) can not be satisfied by such a function .",
    "thus , if we regard the map @xmath68 as a finite `` time evolution '' ( or `` flow '' in the parlance of rg ) , the function @xmath45 must `` evolve '' @xmath40 as an `` _ incompressible fluid _ '' with area preserving dynamics in the complex plane ( or riemann sphere ) .",
    "this flow must be of period two in order to satisfy eq .",
