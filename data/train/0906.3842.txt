    "understanding the nature of scalar mesons is a prominent topic in the past 30 - 40 years .",
    "the importance of the nature of the scalar mesons is that , because the properties of the scalar mesons , especially that with masses below 1.0 gev , are difficult to be understood in the constituent quark models , the study of the light scalar mesons can help us to understand the nonperturbative properties of qcd .",
    "moreover , because the scalar mesons have the same quantum numbers as the vacuum , it can help us to reveal the mechanism of symmetry breaking which is , up to now , one of the most profound problems in particle physics .",
    "many properties of scalar mesons are not so clear although they have been investigated for several decades .",
    "experimentally , it is difficult to identify the scalar mesons because of their large decay widths which cause strong overlaps between resonances and grounds and also because several decay channels open up within a short mass interval . and due to these problems many data on scalar mesons are not so precise , so that it is not so easy to reveal their underlying structures  @xcite",
    ". theoretically , there are many calculations based on different models , but it seems that one can not rule out some of them based on the present measurements .",
    "currently , the observation shows that the known @xmath2 mesons below 2.0 gev can be classified into to classes : one class with masses below ( or near ) 1.0 gev and the other class with masses above 1.0 gev  @xcite .    to study light scalar mesons ,",
    "one problem we have to confront is how to classify the present observed scalar objects .",
    "one opinion is that the scalar objects with masses below 1.0 gev , including two isosinglets @xmath3 and @xmath4 , one isotriplet @xmath5 and two isodoublets @xmath6 , can be classified into one nonet  @xcite . on the contrary , another opinion , inspired by linear sigma model and unitary quark model ,",
    "is that @xmath7 and @xmath8 form a scalar nonet  @xcite .",
    "concerning the structures of light scalar mesons , they are still open questions so far although many attempts have been made to understand them in the literature . for the light scalars mesons with masses below 1.0 gev , some people , by considering their dominant two - body decays , believe that they are multiquark ( or multiquark dominant ) states  @xcite or hadronic molecular states  @xcite ( note that some references list here do not different multiquak state from molecular state . ) .",
    "alternatively , properties of some of these light scalar mesons were also investigated in the @xmath9 picture  @xcite . moreover , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the spectrum of light scalar mesons below 1.0 gev were studied in the @xmath9 picture with including the instanton effect .",
    "and it was found that the @xmath9 components with the instanton or tetraquark effect can explain the spectrum at a certain level . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we also studied the the effect of instanton - induced interaction in light meson spectrum on the basis of the phenomenological harmonic models for quarks . for the light scalar mesons with masses above 1.0 gev , the potential model calculation indicates that they are @xmath9 states .",
    "however , concerning the spectrum of the scalar mesons with masses above 1.0 gev , since there are three isoscalar states , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , one believes that there is a glueball candidate among them . based on the recent lattice results , the mixing between glueball and @xmath9 components in these three objects were fit in ref .",
    "it should be noted that , the two problems we mentioned above are not independent .",
    "if we know the classification of the scalar mesons and the structures of some states , we may deduce the structures of other states according to the classification , and inversely , if the structures of the scalar mesons are confirmed the classification becomes obvious .    in this paper",
    ", since some scalar mesons ( mainly @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) have been studied in the literature and the numerical results yielded there are consistent with the data , we will study the properties of all the scalar mesons with masses below 1.0 gev by regarding all of them as pure hadronic molecules and check whether they form one nonet in the effective lagrangian approach .",
    "our logic is , if the scalar meson with masses below 1.0 gev form a nonet , they should have the same structures . and",
    "if some of them can be interpreted as hadronic molecules as discussed in the literature  @xcite , all the elements in the same nonet should be interpreted as hadronic molecules .",
    "if our start point is reasonable , the yielded results should be consistent with the data . otherwise , it is difficult to classify them into the same nonet , at least in the the hadronic molecular interpretation .    in the molecular picture",
    "the interaction of scalar meson to its constituents can be described by the effective lagrangian .",
    "the corresponding effective coupling constant @xmath12 is determined by the compositeness condition @xmath13 which was earlier used by nuclear physicists and is being widely used by particle physicists(see the references in @xcite ) . in refs .",
    "@xcite this method has been applied to study the newly observed charmed mesons @xcite and the decay properties calculated there are consistent with the observed data .",
    "we had employed the above technique to predict the decay properties of the bottom - strange mesons@xcite and recently we applied this method to studied the baryonium picture of @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "the production and decay properties of some scalar mesons have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite with the help of this technique by regarding them as pure hadronic molecules and the numerical results yielded there agree with the data .",
    "it should be mentioned that , in the tetraquark interpretation of the scalar mesons with masses below 1.0 gev , the diquark @xmath15 is in the @xmath16 representation @xmath17 of @xmath18 group so there are at most two valence strange quarks in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonet ] .",
    "however in the hadronic molecular interpretation , an isosinglet @xmath19 constituent in addition to the isodoublet @xmath20 should be introduced to form a nonet .",
    "so that there is @xmath21 component , or @xmath22 at the quark level , in @xmath3 and @xmath4 which makes it is difficult to understand the scalar meson spectrum from the quark level .",
    "fortunately , in our present work we adopt the scalar meson spectrum as input , with the help of compositeness condition , to determine the coupling constant @xmath23 between the molecule and its constituents .    in our explicit calculation of the effective coupling constant @xmath23",
    ", we will consider two cases , the one is local interaction case and the other one is nonlocal interaction case with including a correlation function which describes the distribution of the constituents among the molecules . as in our previous works , we will introduce a typical scale parameter @xmath24 to describe the finite size of the molecules .",
    "the numerical results show , in the region where the coupling constant @xmath12 is stable against @xmath24 , the yielded value of @xmath12 for the corresponding molecular scalar meson , is consistent with that yielded from the local interaction picture . so that in the other calculations we will take the local interaction vertex . for other interactions",
    ", we will resort to the phenomenological lagrangian and borrow the relevant coupling constants from the existing literature .    to determine the mixing angle @xmath25 between @xmath3 and @xmath4",
    ", we will apply the data for @xmath26 .",
    "it is natural that only with this data one can not fix @xmath25 uniquely and to fix @xmath25 a well measured process of @xmath3 , for example @xmath27 , is necessary .",
    "concerning that the coupling constant @xmath28 depends on the mass of @xmath3 closely , we will not use this data , and will not discuss the physics of @xmath3 in the present work .    with the determined coupling constant @xmath23 we will calculate leptonic decay constants of the scalar mesons and the relevant leptonic decay widths . and from the yielded numerical results , we find that the leptonic decay widths of the scalar mesons are too small to be measured at present . with our hadronic interpretation , the strong decays of the scalar mesons to two - pseudoscalar mesons have also been calculated .",
    "the numerical results for the strong decays indicate that it is difficult to arrange the scalar mesons with masses below 1.0 gev into the same nonet in the hadronic molecular interpretation . to study the productions of the scalar mesons @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the radiative decays of @xmath0 meson , we will includ the final state interaction effect due to the two axial - vector mesons nonets with quantum numbers @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we find the final state interaction plays a negligible role in the production rates .",
    "this paper is organized as the following : in section  [ sec : mol ] , we discuss the molecular structures of the light scalar nonet with masses below 1.0 gev and calculate the coupling constant @xmath12 , the leptonic decay constants and the leptonic decay widths . in section  [ sec : strong ] , the strong decays of the scalar mesons are calculated in the framework of effective lagrangian approach .",
    "the productions of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 mesons in the radiative decays of @xmath0 meson are studied in section  [ sec : radiativephi ] .",
    "our discussions and conclusions are given in the last section .",
    "in this section , we will discuss the properties of the scalar meson nonet below 1.0 gev in the hadronic molecular explanation , i.e. , regarding them as two - pseudoscalar - meson bound states . at first",
    ", we will identify pseudoscalar meson contents of the scalar mesons and construct the effective lagrangian describing the interaction between scalar meson and its constituents .",
    "then the magnitude of the coupling constant @xmath12 is calculated with the help of compositeness condition and the leptonic decay constants and the leptonic decay widths of the scalar mesons are yielded by the standard loop integral .",
    "now , we are in the position to identify the constituents of light scalar meson nonet as hadronic molecules . as we pointed above that we will accept the opinion that the light scalar mesons : two isosinglets @xmath3 and @xmath4 , one isotriplet @xmath5 and two isodoublets @xmath6 , can be classified into one nonet , we should have three elements at least to form this nonet . and considering the physical requirement that the bound state should have a mass smaller than the threshold of the corresponding constituents , the constituents of the light scalar mesons should be @xmath33 and @xmath19 . with these considerations , we may arrange the two - pseudoscalar - meson bound states in the @xmath34 plane ( where @xmath35 is the hypercharge which is relative to the strangeness @xmath36 via relation @xmath37 for mesons and relates the charge @xmath38 and the third component of isospin @xmath39 via relation @xmath40 ) as fig .

    "this makes it seems that it is difficult to understand the scalar meson spectrum in the molecular picture .",
    "however , at present , we do not attempt to calculate the scalar meson spectrum but take the scalar meson masses as input to determine the coupling constants .",
    "the effective lagrangian , without including the distribution of the constituents among the molecules , describing the interaction between the scalar mesons and their constituents can be written as @xmath53 where the upper index `` lc '' denotes the local interaction vertex , @xmath36 denotes the scalar meson matrix which was give in eq .",
