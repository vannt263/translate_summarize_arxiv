    "autonomous motion is an important issue in active soft matter , with possible applications ranging from energy harvesting @xcite to microfluidic transport @xcite and mixing @xcite .",
    "recently realized microswimmers carry , as active element , heat - absorbing or catalytic parts which generate temperature or concentration gradients in the surrounding liquid .  for particles dispersed in bulk phases ,",
    "these thermodynamic forces give rise to an effective slip velocity , which in turn implies self - propulsion at a speed of the order of ten microns per second pax05,qia13 .    much higher velocities can be achieved for active particles trapped at a liquid interface , where the self - generated temperature or concentration gradient induces a non - uniform interface tension and a marangoni flow . upon laser - heating one side of a centimeter - size object floating on water , oka09 observed self - propulsion at several cm / s .",
    "the mutual marangoni advection of camphor releasing gel particles results in dynamical self assembly @xcite    recent theoretical studies dealt with marangoni propulsion due to a non - uniform surfactant concentration .",
    "the resulting marangoni stress comprises a dipolar term that is proportional to the inverse distance from its source .",
    "thus @xcite calculated the marangoni flow for an asymmetric active disk , whereas @xcite considered the motion of ellipsoidal particles in terms of a reciprocal theorem .",
    "accounting for advective non - linearities in the surfactant concentration , @xcite found spontaneous rotation of particles floating on a liquid droplet .    in the present paper we consider marangoni propulsion driven by  a non - uniform temperature or bulk concentration field , the dipolar term of which decays with the square of inverse distance .",
    "assuming small reynolds , marangoni , pclet , and capillary numbers , we rely on stokes equation , linearize the field dependent tension , and neglect the interface deformation .",
    "for a spherical particle with an off - center heat source , we calculate both the long - range marangoni flow @xmath2 driven by the non - uniform interface tension and the short - range velocity @xmath3 imposed by no - slip condition on the particle surface .",
    "consider a colloidal particle trapped at a liquid interface . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we discuss a sphere that is trapped at midplane , as shown in fig .  1 .  retaining the first two terms of the multipole expansion of the temperature profile we find @xmath4where",
    "@xmath5 is the total power absorbed by the particle and @xmath6 the sum of the thermal conductivities of the lower and upper fluid phases .",
    "the strength and orientation of the dipole term are given by the position of the absorption area with respect to the particle center , @xmath7 , as shown in fig .  1 for a point - like heat source",
    "moreover , @xmath8 depends on the conductivity contrast of the particle and fluid phases . in the case of a chemical marangoni effect , @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    "are the solute concentration and diffusivity in the fluid phases and @xmath5 is the chemical activity at the particle surface .",
    "the thermal gradient induces a marangoni flow along the liquid interface .",
    "the temperature dependence of the interface tension , @xmath11 , results in the hydrodynamic boundary condition @xmath12where @xmath13  is the stress discontinuity across the interface , @xmath14 the ( downward oriented ) normal vector , and @xmath15 the tension gradient . the stress tensor @xmath16 comprises viscous and pressure terms , @xmath17 , with the velocity components @xmath18 and where the viscosity @xmath19 takes values @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the two phases .",
    "the fluid velocity is continuous at the interface , and its normal component must vanish , @xmath22one more boundary condition is provided by the no - slip condition at the particle surface,@xmath23where @xmath24 is the velocity field of the fluid and @xmath25 the particle velocity , which is necessarily parallel to the interface .",
    "since there are no external body forces acting on the particle we have @xmath26where the first term gives the net force exerted by the surface tension along the contact line with element @xmath27 , and the second one , the surface integral of the stress tensor with the oriented surface element @xmath28 .",
    "for later convenience we rewrite the above conditions for the velocity and stress compenents in spherical coordinates . with the axes defined in fig .",
    "1 we have @xmath29 and    [ 12 ] @xmath30inserting the temperature gradient in ( [ 2 ] ) , we find @xmath31the zero normal velocity at the interface involves the polar component only ,    @xmath32    finally , imposing no - slip at the surface of the particle moving at velocity @xmath33 along the @xmath34-axis , we have @xmath35    the cosine @xmath36 turns out to be a more convenient coordinate than the polar angle @xmath37 .",
    "thus we use the shorthand notation @xmath38note that @xmath39 is positive everywhere , whereas @xmath40 and @xmath41 on the upper and lower halfspaces , respectively .",
    "finally we note that the particle is not allowed to rotate about the horizontal axis . in other words , the point @xmath8 in fig .  1",
    "is confined to the interface plane .",
    "this condition could be imposed through appropriate surface functionalization ; it is satisfied , for example , if heating occurs through a small metal patch which itself is trapped at the fluid phase boundary .",
    "the velocity field is solution of stokes equation @xmath42 , which results in a set of coupled differiential equations for the three velocity components @xmath43 and the pressure @xmath44 . with the vector laplace operator one has    [ 1 ] @xmath45where the derivative with respect to the polar angle is replaced according to @xmath46 .",
    "the first term of each equation is given by the scalar laplace operator @xmath47similarly , we have for the incompressibility condition @xmath48for later use we give the components of the symmetrized stress in spherical coordinates ,    @xmath49    in view of ( [ 2 ] ) we need the off - diagonal components @xmath50 and @xmath51 . the above relations are valid in each of the fluid phases , albeit with different viscosities @xmath20 and @xmath52 .",
    "we write the fluid velocity as the sum of two terms , @xmath53the first of which accounts for the source field ( [ 12 ] ) with the boundary condition ( [ 13 ] ) .",
    "this field fully describes the marangoni flow induced by a pointlike heat source . for a particle of finite size , the second term @xmath1",
    "is required in order to assure the no - slip condition at its surface .",
    "this is achieved by chosing @xmath1 such that it satisfies both ( [ 13 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) , yet does not contribute to the marangoni stress .",
    "since the marangoni stress ( [ 12 ] ) results in a jump of the velocity derivatives , the velocity is not analytic at the interface .",
    "the isotropic component of @xmath55 varies with the distance as @xmath56 , and the dipolar contribution as @xmath57 .",
    "this implies that @xmath2 consists of axially symmetric and dipolar terms proportional to @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respecively .",
    "the marangoni flow of a heat source at the origin is obtained from the stream function @xmath60 with the velocity scale @xmath61 , @xmath62both radial and polar components are proportional to the inverse distance ; @xmath63 diverges on the positive @xmath64-axis for the minus sign , and on the negative one for the plus sign .",
    "we look for solutions of stokes equation that vary with distance as @xmath65 and that are singular at @xmath66 . with the coordinates defined in fig .",
    "1 , it is clear that that radial and polar components are proportional to @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "thus we have @xmath69inserting this ansatz in ( [ 1 ] ) results in four coupled equations for the functions @xmath70 ; the incompressibility condition involves @xmath71 and @xmath72  only .",
    "by successive elimination we obtain a single fourth - order differential equation for @xmath71 , @xmath73from its solution one readily constructs the remaining components and the related pressure ; discarding regular and logarithmic terms we have @xmath74with coefficients @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "note that the velocity field diverges along the vertical axis @xmath66 .",
    "in view of the stress jump ( [ 12 ] ) it is clear that the velocity above and below the interface can not be given in closed form .",
    "analytic solutions in the halfspaces @xmath77 are obtained by putting @xmath78then the singular factors in ( [ 34 ] ) disappear , and the relevant solution is given by    @xmath79    with @xmath80 and where the plus and minus signs are valid in the upper and lower halfspaces , respectively .",
    "the axisymmetric part corresponds to ( [ 22 ] ) , whereas the terms proportional to @xmath76 are obtained from ( 34 ) .",
    "the contributions with @xmath81  and @xmath82  are well - known regular flow patterns @xcite that have been added in order to meet the boundary conditions at the interface .",
    "the velocity field is symmetric with respect to the interface plane and continuous at @xmath83 , yet its derivatives are not and lead to a stress discontinuity along the interface.finally , the corresponding pressure reads as @xmath84the pressure vanishes at @xmath83 and thus is continuous at the interface .",
    "since the viscosity @xmath19 in general takes different values in the upper and lower phases , the normal component of the pressure gradient is discontinuous .",
    "now we determine the parameters @xmath61 and @xmath85 from the boundary conditions . in view of (",
    "[ 13 ] ) for the normal velocity component we put @xmath86 and find    @xmath87    from ( [ 3 ] ) we calculate the off - diagonal stress components @xmath88 and @xmath51  at both sides of the interface . their difference @xmath89 is proportional to the sum of the viscosities @xmath90 , @xmath91inserting the temperature gradient in the boundary conditions ( [ 12 ] ) , one readily obtains the velocity scale @xmath61 and the remaining coefficients @xmath92 , @xmath93(for a liquid - air interface one has @xmath94 and @xmath95 . )",
    "then the velocity field reads    [ 5 ] @xmath96where the upper and lower signs occur in the upper and lower halfspaces , respectively .",
    "the corresponding pressure    @xmath97    is proportional to @xmath98 and thus vanishes at the interface .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 5a ] ) constitute the solution for a pointlike interface particle carrying temperature monopole and dipole moments . the latter results in a radial flow velocity at the interface proportional to @xmath99 .      from elementary symmetry considerations",
    "it is clear that both contributions to ( [ 6 ] ) have finite components along the @xmath34-axis only .",
    "thus the contact line element @xmath100 reduces to the component @xmath101 , and the non - uniform interface tension leads to a net force @xmath102 .",

    "the relevant component of the stress tensor reads @xmath123 in view of ( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 18 ] ) , it is clear that the surface integral of @xmath124 vanishes , @xmath125 in physical terms this means that there is no additional drag force arising from @xmath124 and thus no stokeslet contribution to the flow @xmath126 .    in order not to interfere with the above solution @xmath2 and the conditions ( [ 12 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] )",
    ", the additional term @xmath109 satisfies @xmath127putting @xmath83 in both velocity and stress components , one finds that all coefficients vanish except for   @xmath128with @xmath111 these coefficients are determined from the boundary condition at the particle surface ( [ 5 ] ) .",

    ", the diffusive heat transport does not catch up the particle s motion , resulting in an asymmetric temperature profile that decays more rapidly in front of the moving particle ( @xmath205 ) and thus significantly modifies the marangoni stress ( [ 2 ] ) .",
