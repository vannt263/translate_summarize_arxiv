    "one century ago , in 1908 , hermann minkowski @xcite gave a complete relativistically covariant formulation of classical maxwell - lorentzian electrodynamics .",
    "in particular , he demonstrated how the macroscopic physical processes in moving bodies and media can be derived from the knowledge of the physics of the matter at rest .",
    "an important issue in phenomenological macroscopic electrodynamics of moving media is the definition of the energy and momentum of the electromagnetic field in matter .",
    "rather surprisingly , this topic has demonstrated a remarkable longevity , and the question of the electromagnetic energy and momentum in matter was not settled until now , despite some theoretical and experimental achievements .",
    "it is not our aim to give a complete history of this issue .",
    "after minkowski proposed @xcite his version of the energy - momentum tensor , abraham @xcite entered the dispute with a different expression .",
    "the main formal difference between the minkowski and the abraham energy - momentum tensors is that the latter is symmetric while the former is not .",
    "since then , the discussion was going on which of these two tensors is correct ( along with some other attempts , among which it is worthwhile to mention the results of einstein and laub @xcite , of de groot and suttorp @xcite and of peierls @xcite ) .",
    "of the early studies , the work of dllenbach and ishiwara @xcite deserves to be mentioned .",
    "the later contributions of von laue , beck , haus @xcite and many others @xcite and @xcite brought more arguments and more confusion into the discussion .",
    "eventually , it became clear that the study of the electromagnetic field alone is insufficient , and the idea was put forward that all possible tensors are correct , depending on the way how field and matter are separated into two subsystems , see for example @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more recent discussions were devoted to the analysis of this separation question @xcite , along with @xcite and @xcite .    from a theoretical point of view , the most important developments should perhaps be attributed to schmutzer and schrder @xcite who stressed the relation of the minkowski and the canonical energy - momentum tensor , to poincelot @xcite for underlining the universality of the lorentz force , and to penfield , haus , and mikura @xcite for coming up with the first working models for polarizable and magnetizable matter in the framework of the lagrange variational approach . in our paper , these points will be put into the center of the discussion , following our earlier studies @xcite . some relevant results were also presented in the recent interesting papers of dereli et al.@xcite .",
    "it is clearly impossible to mention even briefly all the names and to discuss all the contributions to the issue of the electromagnetic energy and momentum in a short paper .",
    "moreover , since we will mainly pay attention to the theoretical questions here , the experimental results in this area will be not be properly discussed . in order to get more information",
    ", the readers should consult the thorough reviews @xcite , see also the most recent one in @xcite .",
    "our basic notations and conventions follow the book @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath0 are the electric and the magnetic constant ( earlier called vacuum permittivity and vacuum permeability ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to stress that we do not choose any special system of physical units . in other words",
    ", the presence of @xmath1 and @xmath2 in our formulas does not mean that the international system si is used , their values are different for si , lorentz - heaviside , and rational systems , and they are fixed only after the specific unit system is chosen .",
    "more on physical dimensions and units can be found in @xcite . we do not discuss gravitational effects , the spacetime is flat .",
    "the minkowski metric is @xmath3 .",
    "the totally antisymmetric levi - civita tensor @xmath4 is defined by @xmath5 , with @xmath6 .",
    "latin indices from the middle of the alphabet label the spacetime components , @xmath7 , whereas those from the beginning of the alphabet refer to 3-space : @xmath8 .",
    "quite generally , the lagrangian of the _ electromagnetic field in matter _ can be written as @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the electromagnetic field strength constructed from the potential @xmath11 , and the tensor density @xmath12 describes the electric and magnetic properties of matter .",
    "this quantity may also depend on @xmath13 , thereby taking into account possible nonlinear electromagnetic effects , but in the first approximation @xmath12 is a function only of the matter variables that describe the state of the medium .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to _ linear electrodynamics_.    as usual , we define the _ electromagnetic excitation _ tensor density by @xmath14 for the theory ( [ le ] ) we then find the linear constitutive relation @xcite @xmath15 accordingly , we then have @xmath16 .    in the conventional way , the components of the tensors @xmath13 and @xmath17 describe the electric and magnetic fields @xmath18 and the electric and magnetic excitations @xmath19 ( other names of which are  electric displacement \" and  magnetic field intensity \" ) : @xmath20 it is worthwhile to mention that it was minkowski @xcite who introduced the notion of a bivector ( which he called  raum - zeit - vektor ii@xmath21 art \" , i.e. , a second rank tensor in the modern terminology ) and wrote for the first time the maxwell electrodynamics in the explicitly covariant four - dimensional tensor form .    in vacuum",
    ", the electromagnetic action reads @xmath22 , where @xmath23 . as a result , in vacuum",
    "we find for the constitutive tensor density @xmath24 consequently , the linear constitutive relation ( [ hf ] ) in vacuum in cartesian coordinates reads ( note that @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 ) @xmath28 or , equivalently , in 3-dimensional form @xmath29    in macroscopic electrodynamics , a polarizable and magnetizable medium is characterized by the nontrivial polarization @xmath30 and magnetization @xmath31 .",
    "they arise from the bound charge and current densities @xmath32 via the standard relations @xmath33 the vacuum constitutive law ( [ hf0v ] ) in a medium is changed @xcite into @xmath34 analogously to the electric and magnetic fields , the polarization and magnetization are not 3-vectors , but constitute the components of the 4-dimensional polarization tensor of second rank , @xmath35 correspondingly , the constitutive relation ( [ hf1v ] ) can be recast into @xmath36 and , introducing the 4-vector of the _ bound current _",
    "@xmath37 , equation ( [ pm ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath38    combining ( [ hf ] ) and ( [ hf0 ] ) , we can put the constitutive relation in an alternative equivalent form : @xmath39 in general , the _ susceptibility tensor density _",
    "@xmath40 describes also the magnetoelectric effects when the medium is magnetized in an electric field and/or polarized in a magnetic field .",
    "contrary to a general belief ( and perhaps somewhat surprisingly ) there does not exist any derivation of the abraham energy - momentum tensor _ from first principles_. in this section , we give a formal definition of what can be called the  abrahamization \" prescription that can be applied to an arbitrary energy - momentum tensor .",
    "more precisely , let us assume that we can associate with a given physical system a second rank tensor @xmath41 , the components of which are interpreted as follows : @xmath42 is a density of energy of the system , @xmath43 ( with @xmath44 ) is the energy flux density (  poynting vector \" ) , @xmath45 is the momentum density , and @xmath46 is the stress tensor .",
    "we do not assume that this tensor is conserved , and the divergence @xmath47 describes , in general , the balance equation of the system .",
    "for @xmath48 , this yields the familiar energy balance equation @xmath49 . integrating over a three - dimensional volume @xmath50",
    ", we find in a usual way that the change in time of the total energy @xmath51 combined with the energy flux through the boundary , @xmath52 , is equal to the total power production of the system @xmath53 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath54 we recover the balance equation @xmath55 of the momentum of the system under the action of the force @xmath56 .",
    "the 4-vector force density vanishes , @xmath57 , for a closed physical system that does not interact with other systems .",
    "let us raise the first index , @xmath58 .",
    "the resulting covariant tensor is not symmetric in general : @xmath59 . in particular",
    ", this means that the momentum density is not equal to the energy flux density , @xmath60 .",
    "there is nothing unphysical about this fact which may be explained , for example , by the nontrivial intrinsic angular momentum ( spin ) of the elements of the system @xcite .",
    "a well known symmetrization prescription of belinfante and rosenfeld @xcite allows one to construct from the original @xmath41 and from the spin density tensor another energy - momentum tensor @xmath61 which is symmetric , @xmath62 , and has the same divergence @xmath63 .",
    "a different symmetrization procedure is possible for the case when a timelike vector field @xmath64 is available , with @xmath65 .",
    "physically , @xmath64 can be interpreted as a 4-velocity of the system with respect to the inertial reference frame . with the help of this field",
    ", we can introduce the transversal and longitudinal projectors @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "let us denote the antisymmetric part of the original energy - momentum tensor by @xmath68 } = ( t^{ij } - t^{ji})/2 $ ]",
    ". then we define @xmath69 by construction , this object is symmetric , @xmath70 and has the following crucial property : for the system _ at rest _ , @xmath71 , the time - time and space - space components coincide with the original symmetrized ones , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , whereas the off - diagonal ( time - space and space - time ) components read @xmath74 in other words , the energy flux density (  poynting vector \" ) remains the same as before , @xmath75 , but the momentum density @xmath76 is replaced with @xmath77 .    the belinfante - rosenfeld procedure and the _ abrahamization _ ( [ tadef ] ) of the energy - momentum tensor both produce symmetric tensors from a given original asymmetric energy - momentum @xmath41",
    ". however , these two symmetrization schemes are distinct in the following significant point . for the belinfante - rosenfeld approach ,",
    "the balance equation remains untouched because the divergence @xmath78 is preserved .",
    "in contrast , the divergence @xmath79 .",
    "let us find the difference of the two force densities , @xmath80 and @xmath81 . from ( [ tadef ] ) , @xmath82 in the rest frame , @xmath71",
    ", we find @xmath83 and @xmath84 we use the boldface notation for the spatial 3-dimensional objects .",
    "in particular , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , whereas the antisymmetric part of the stress tensor gives rise to @xmath88 .    as such",
    ", the definition ( [ tadef ] ) looks rather artificial . to the best of my knowledge , there does not exist any derivation of ( [ tadef ] ) from first principles , such as from the lagrange - noether machinery , for example .",
    "one merely demands the symmetry of the energy - momentum tensor under the condition that the energy density and the energy flux density in the rest frame remain the same .",
    "the form of the resulting @xmath89 is then fixed by ( [ tadef ] ) which leads to the additional  abraham force \" terms ( [ diff2 ] ) in the balance equations .",
    "it is sometimes claimed that the symmetry is a fundamental property of the energy - momentum tensor that is related to the conservation of the angular momentum of the system . in order to clarify this point ,",
    "let us recall the relevant facts of the lagrange and noether theory .",
    "suppose we have a system of the fields denoted collectively by @xmath90 .",
    "its dynamics is described by the action integral @xmath91 , where the lagrangian ( density ) is a function of the fields and their derivatives , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 are the ( local ) spacetime coordinates .",
    "when the action @xmath94 is invariant under the _ spacetime translations _ , one finds the conservation law @xmath95 here the _",
    "canonical energy - momentum tensor _ is defined by @xmath96 and we use standard notation for the the variational derivative , @xmath97    similarly , assuming that action is invariant under the _ lorentz group _ , that acts on the coordinates and fields , we find @xmath98 } + \\partial_i\\,s_{jk}{}^i = -\\,{\\frac { \\delta l}{\\delta\\phi^a } } \\,(\\rho_{jk})^a_b\\,\\phi^b.\\label{ds}\\ ] ] here @xmath99 are the lorentz generators for the fields @xmath90 , and the _ spin current density _ is introduced by @xmath100 recall that the lorentz generators are skew - symmetric , @xmath101 . hence the spin is skew - symmetric too , @xmath102 .    when the physical system is closed in the sense that it does not interact with other systems , then its state is completely described by the variables @xmath90 and their dynamics in time and space .",
    "the latter is determined by the field equations , @xmath103 . using this in the conservation laws ( [ dt ] ) and ( [ ds ] )",

    "accordingly , we find that the canonical energy - momentum tensor is symmetric when the spin is trivial , @xmath106 .",
    "otherwise , we can use the belinfante - rosenfeld @xcite procedure to derive the symmetric tensor @xmath107 . by construction",

    "@xmath110 and we have to keep the corresponding terms on the right hand sides of ( [ dt ] ) and ( [ ds ] ) .",
    "these terms describe forces and torques which result from the interaction of the systems . even when the spin is absent , the canonical energy - momentum of an open physical system is , in general , necessarily asymmetric in order to maintain the balance of the nontrivial torque present on the right - hand side of ( [ ds ] ) .",
    "we will see below how this works for the electromagnetic field interacting with polarizable and magnetizable matter .",
    "after the preparations done in the previous three sections , we are now in a position to start the main discussion . here we consider the construction of the canonical and symmetric energy - momentum tensors in the _ macroscopic electrodynamics _ of media .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian approach was formulated in sec .",
    "[ maxwell ] .",
    "our starting point is the action @xmath111 .    without loosing generality",
    ", we can choose the collective field of the system as @xmath112 .",
    "the set of all fields is thus naturally divided into the two sectors , an electromagnetic and a material one .",
    "it is not necessary to specify how the tensor density @xmath12 depends on the more fundamental material variables ( we can always do this at a later stage ) , but instead it is convenient to treat @xmath12 itself as a generalized material variable .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ le ] ) contains only derivatives of the electromagnetic potential @xmath11 but not of @xmath12 , and thus we easily derive from ( [ emt ] ) and ( [ le ] ) the canonical energy - momentum tensor of the system : @xmath113 this is the well known _",
    "minkowski energy - momentum_. since the system is obviously _",
    "open _ , the canonical tensor is not conserved .",
    "this becomes clear when we calculate the variational derivatives that enter the right - hand side of ( [ dt ] ) .",
    "indeed , we find explicitly @xmath114 both variational derivatives are clearly nontrivial .",
    "we should take into account that this ( electromagnetic field ) system interacts with the matter , and the total lagrangian is thus the sum @xmath115 . after introducing the electric current @xmath116 , one then derives the maxwell field equation @xmath117 this shows that @xmath118 vanishes only in the absence of electric charge and current densities of matter , but in general @xmath119 . substituting ( [ ll ] ) into ( [ dt ] ) , we derive the energy - momentum balance equation for linear maxwellian electrodynamics as @xmath120 the first term on the right - hand side is the familiar lorentz force , whereas the second term requires some analysis . at first",
    ", we notice that @xmath121 where we used ( [ hf1 ] ) .",

    "the corresponding energy and momentum , associated with the free and bound charges , are described by @xmath128 and @xmath129 , respectively . as a result",
    ", the balance equation ( [ dtt ] ) is recast into @xmath130 with the lorentz force on the right - hand side that acts on all types of charges ( free and bound ) present in the medium .    combining ( [ emte ] ) and ( [ emtp ] ) , and using the constitutive relation ( [ hf1 ] )",
    ", we derive the explicit form of the total energy - momentum : @xmath131 this energy - momentum tensor was discussed by poincelot @xcite and more recently by us @xcite .    quite remarkably",
    ", we discover that the form of the total electromagnetic energy - momentum tensor in media is precisely the same as in vacuum .",
    "it is worthwhile to stress that the final result ( [ dt ] ) is a direct consequence of the fact that the electromagnetic field is an _ open system _ ( [ le ] ) .",
    "the energy and momentum of the electromagnetic field are described by the _",
    "canonical ( = minkowski ) _ tensor ( [ emte ] ) , but since the system is open , the balance equation ( [ dtm ] ) contains nontrivial force terms that arise from the interaction of the field with matter .",
    "a careful evaluation of the force @xmath132 then eventually brings the balance equation into the final form ( [ dt ] ) .",
    "this general result is the best what can be done without entering into the question about the structure and dynamics of the medium . in the next section",
    "we will discuss a specific model of matter and demonstrate how the additional knowledge of the physical nature of a medium can provide a different computation of the force term @xmath132 .",
    "the canonical energy - momentum ( [ emte ] ) is not symmetric .",
    "however , this does not mean that there is a problem with the angular momentum conservation .",
    "we simply have to recall once again that the system is open , and hence the right - hand side of the angular momentum balance equation ( [ ds ] ) does not vanish , because the variational derivatives ( [ ll ] ) are nontrivial .",

    "there is a somewhat subtle point which we silently avoided in our previous discussion .",
    "however , for completeness we have to mention it now .",
    "namely , it is well known that there exist two possible choices of the electromagnetic variable : _ ( i ) _ we can take the 1-form @xmath137 as fundamental variable , and construct the corresponding lagrangian as a function of the field strength 2-form @xmath138 .",
    "this is our choice which we assumed in the book @xcite and also here .",
    "the potential 1-form @xmath137 is an invariant object independent of local coordinates and frames , and it does not transform under lorentz rotations .",
    "the canonical energy - momentum 3-form then turns out to be explicitly gauge - invariant , given in tensor language by the expression ( [ emte ] ) , while the spin density formally vanishes .",
    "_ ( ii ) _ the second choice is to take the components @xmath11 of a covector . they transform ( with a usual tensorial law ) under the lorentz group , and the corresponding generators read @xmath139}$ ] .",
    "for such a choice of the field variable , the energy - momentum tensor is given by the gauge noninvariant expression which is obtained from ( [ emte ] ) by the shift @xmath140 , with an additional term @xmath141 .",
    "since @xmath142}$ ] , we find from ( [ spin ] ) the spin tensor @xmath143}$ ] .",
    "its divergence thus contributes to the left - hand side of ( [ ds ] ) which now reads @xmath144 } + \\partial_is_{jk}{}^i = -\\,h_{[k}{}^i\\partial_{|i|}a_{j ] } + \\partial_i(h^i{}_{[j}a_{k ] } ) = ( \\partial_ih^i{}_{[j})a_{k]}.\\ ] ] but at the same time , a new term appears on the right - hand side of ( [ ds ] ) : @xmath145 } = ( \\partial_ih^i{}_{[j})a_{k]}.\\ ] ] accordingly , we find _ identically _ @xmath144 } + \\partial_is_{jk}{}^i \\equiv -\\,{\\frac { \\delta l^{\\rm e } } { \\delta a_n}}(\\rho_{jk})^m_na_m.\\ ] ] thus we come to the same conclusion that the angular momentum balance equation is perfectly satisfied despite the lack of the symmetry of the canonical energy - momentum tensor .      in sec .",
    "[ abr ] , we described a general procedure for constructing a symmetric tensor from an arbitrary energy - momentum .",
    "now we can apply this scheme to the electromagnetic field , taking the canonical energy - momentum ( [ emte ] ) as an input .",
    "although we have demonstrated above that the argument of the  violation of the angular momentum conservation \" is unsubstantiated for open systems , it seems reasonable to perform a detailed comparison of the energy - momentum tensors available on the market .    in this approach",
    ", we assume the existence of the timelike vector field @xmath64 , with @xmath146 . then substituting ( [ emte ] ) and ( [ emtma ] ) into the definition ( [ tadef ] ) , we construct the abraham tensor of the electromagnetic energy - momentum : @xmath147.\\label{emta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the rest frame , @xmath71",

    "however , the theoretical foundation of the minkowski tensor obviously appears to be far more solid than that of the abraham tensor .",
    "the former arises as a canonical energy - momentum tensor in the lagrange - noether framework , whereas the latter one is not derived from first principles .",
    "nevertheless , as we will demonstrate in the next section , the abraham tensor does resurface after we specify the structure and the dynamics of matter .",

    "[ maxwell ] and the material system of sec .",
    "[ mat ] . in order to do this",
    ", we need one important additional input .",
    "namely , we need to specify how exactly the two systems interact . in the most general form , the information about this interaction is encoded in the constitutive tensor density @xmath12 in the electromagnetic lagrangian ( [ le ] ) .",
    "the model of the fluid , which we studied in the previous section , obviously describes the polarizable / magnetizable medium with isotropic electric and magnetic properties .",
    "such matter is characterized by the two scalar quantities : the permittivity @xmath190 and the permeability @xmath191 . in order to take into account the possible _ electrostriction and magnetostriction _ effects ,",
    "we allow for these quantities to be the functions of the particle density ,",
    "@xmath192    we thus assume that the medium is intrinsically _ isotropic _ , and the possible _ anisotropic _ effects may arise only from the nontrivial motion of the medium , i.e. , they are induced by the velocity of the fluid .",
    "the constitutive relation for an arbitrarily moving isotropic medium is well known .",
    "it is given by the famous minkowski equations , see @xcite , sec.e.4.2 , eqs.(e.4.28)-(e.4.29 ) and ( e.4.25)-(e.4.26 ) .",
    "the constitutive tensor for this case is given by the formula that is very close to ( [ chi0 ] ) , namely , @xmath193 where @xmath194 and the so - called _ optical metric _ was first introduced by gordon @xcite : @xmath195 here @xmath196 is the refraction coefficient of the medium .",
    "we straightforwardly find @xmath197 , and thus the lagrangian ( [ le ] ) of the electromagnetic field finally reads @xmath198.\\label{lem}\\ ] ] the components of the electromagnetic field @xmath13 are given with respect to the laboratory system . in order to get some further insight into the formulas above , we notice that the electric and magnetic fields in the comoving system ( in which the medium is momentarily at rest ) can be described by the 4-vectors @xmath199 the field strength is uniquely reconstructed from these vectors as @xmath200 the electromagnetic lagrangian ( [ lem ] ) looks remarkably simple in these variables : @xmath201 with the obvious abbreviations @xmath202 and @xmath203",
    ". both vectors are by construction orthogonal to the 4-velocity , @xmath204 and @xmath205 . hence , @xmath206 and @xmath207 .    in sec .",
    "[ em ] we treated the whole constitutive tensor density @xmath12 as the material variable .",
    "now , after specifying the model of the medium , we have something better .",
    "the fluid under consideration is described by the variables @xmath64 and @xmath153 , and the constitutive tensor now becomes a known function @xmath208 , given by the equation ( [ chi1 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding variational derivatives of the electromagnetic lagrangian with respect to the material variables are easily computed : @xmath209 we used ( [ lem ] ) to derive ( [ dleu ] ) , however , it is much simpler to use a different ( equivalent ) form of the lagrangian ( [ lem2 ] ) to obtain ( [ dlen ] ) .",
    "after all these preliminaries , we are now in a position to find the explicit form of the energy - momentum tensors and to analyse the corresponding balance equations .",
    "the electromagnetic excitation ( [ hij ] ) for the lagrangian ( [ lem ] ) is @xmath210.\\label{hij0}\\ ] ] substituting this into ( [ emte ] ) , we find the explicit form of the canonical ( minkowski ) energy - momentum of the electromagnetic field : @xmath211.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this tensor is not symmetric , and its antisymmetric part ( [ emtma ] ) now reads explicitly @xmath212 } = -\\,{\\frac { n^2 - 1}{\\mu\\mu_0c^2 } } \\,u_{[j}f_{k]i}f^{il}u_l.\\ ] ]      as we know , the minkowski tensor ( [ emtef ] ) is not conserved , and the energy - momentum balance equation ( [ dtm ] ) contains a nontrivial force on the right - hand side , @xmath213 . since @xmath208 , we have @xmath214 then the force density can be easily calculated , @xmath215 where we used ( [ le ] ) and ( [ dleu ] ) .",
    "furthermore , for the explicit dependence of the constitutive tensor ( [ chi1 ] ) on @xmath64 and for the lorentz generators @xmath216}$ ] of the 4-velocity vector field , we prove the identity @xmath217 making use of the variational derivative ( [ dleu ] ) , we have @xmath218n}f^{nl}u_l.\\ ] ] comparing with ( [ emtmskew ] ) , we thus verify that the balance equation of the angular momentum @xmath219 } \\equiv -\\,{\\frac { \\delta l^{\\rm e } } { \\delta u^m}}(\\rho_{jk})^m_n\\,u^n\\ ] ] is identically satisfied in this case , as before .",
    "now , the crucial step is to recall that the total system @xmath220 of the coupled electromagnetic field and medium is _",

    "in particular , combining ( [ eqm ] ) with ( [ dleu ] ) and ( [ dlen ] ) , we have @xmath225 remarkably , the effective pressure describes the electro- and magnetostriction effects . substituting ( [ pkf ] ) into ( [ emtf ] )",
    ", we obtain the final expression @xmath226    the total canonical energy - momentum tensor is the sum of the electromagnetic ( minkowski ) tensor ( [ emtef ] ) and of the energy - momentum of the fluid ( [ emtf0 ] ) .",

    ", we observe that all the energy - momentum tensors are related via the interesting equation @xmath232 so to say , the abraham tensor ",
    "absorbed \" all the terms which explicitly contained the electromagnetic field , except for the electrostriction and magnetostriction terms , both from the minkowski canonical tensor of the electromagnetic field and from the canonical energy - momentum of the matter .",
    "the fact that the abraham tensor resurfaced at the end of our derivations requires an additional analysis .",
    "whereas the minkowski tensor has a solid standing as a canonical energy - momentum deeply rooted in the lagrange - noether formalism , the abraham tensor appears a rather artificial construct , as we saw in sec .",
    "so , why is it recovered in the equation ( [ ttot ] ) ? is this a coincidence , a specific feature of the models that we used for the description of the electromagnetic and material systems , or something more fundamental ?",
    "here we demonstrate that the latter is true , in a certain sense .      at first , we prove the following technical point .",
    "let @xmath233 be an antisymmetric tensor and @xmath234 a 4-vector .",
    "then @xmath235 satisfies the algebraic equation @xmath236 if and only if this tensor is constructed from @xmath234 and the velocity @xmath64 as @xmath237}.\\label{ab2}\\ ] ]    the proof is straightforward . let us assume that ( [ ab2 ] ) is true .",
    "then @xmath238 hence , ( [ ab1 ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "conversely , suppose ( [ ab1 ] ) is true .",
    "contracting this equation with @xmath64 , we find @xmath239 on the other hand , from ( [ ab1 ] ) we have , making use of ( [ ab3 ] ) : @xmath240 this finally yields , again using ( [ ab3 ] ) , @xmath241 thus , the statement is proved .",
    "we now extend the electrodynamical model of sec .",
    "[ maxmodel ] by generalizing the constitutive law ( [ chi1 ] ) .",
    "namely , we assume that the constitutive tensor @xmath12 is not a particular function ( [ chi1 ] ) of the 4-velocity @xmath64 and of the particle density @xmath153 , but it rather is some general function @xmath242 here the collective variable @xmath243 denotes all possible parameters that describe the state of the polarizable / magnetizable medium . in the macroscopic approach , @xmath243 includes the most general matrices of dielectric , magnetic , and magnetoelectric susceptibilities .",
    "an important assumption is that these parameters are _ not changed _ under the lorentz transformations relating different reference systems .",
    "more precisely , we thus assume that the 4-velocity of the medium @xmath64 is _ the only ( lorentz ) covariant object _ that enters the electrodynamical constitutive relation ( [ chi2 ] ) , and the other material variables @xmath244 are all scalars under the lorentz transformations . technically ,",
    "this is realized by assuming that the parameters @xmath243 take their genuine ( or intrinsic ) values in the comoving reference system with respect to which the medium is momentarily at rest . in other reference systems , these intrinsic values of @xmath243 remain the same , whereas in every reference system the form of the constitutive matrices is determined _ only by the motion of the medium _ , i.e. , in technical terms , by the velocity @xmath64 .",
    "this assumption has the far - reaching consequences .",
    "since the velocity @xmath64 is the only covariant argument ( with the lorentz generators @xmath186}$ ] ) of the constitutive tensor @xmath245 , we have @xmath246}.\\ ] ] [ hint : denoting @xmath247 the parameters of the lorentz group , @xmath248 gives the infinitesimal lorentz transformation ; using for differentiation the chain rule completes the proof . ] as a result , we notice that the angular momentum balance equation ( [ angbal ] ) is of the form ( [ ab2 ] ) where @xmath249},\\qquad \\beta_k = { \\frac { \\delta l^{\\rm e}}{\\delta u^k}}.\\ ] ] accordingly , combining ( [ ab1 ] ) with the definition of the abraham tensor ( [ tadef ] ) , we find the relation @xmath250 adding the canonical energy - momentum ( [ emtf ] ) , ( [ pk ] ) , we then finally come to the equation ( [ ttot ] ) .",
    "this analysis demonstrates that the relation ( [ ttot ] ) between the canonical energy - momentum tensors and the abraham energy - momentum is not occasional .",
    "it is valid not only for the isotropic constitutive relation ( [ chi1 ] ) of the specific model which we studied in sec .",
    "[ maxmodel ] , but for the general constitutive relation ( [ chi2 ] ) as well .",
    "[ fact ] provides an explanation why the abrahamization prescription ( [ tadef ] ) is successful , after all .",
    "the key to the abraham tensor is in the 4-velocity of the medium : when @xmath64 is the only ( lorentz ) covariant variable that enters the constitutive relation ( and only then ) , the projections of the minkowski tensor satisfy ( [ ab1 ] ) that yields ( [ marel ] ) .",
    "this explains why the abraham tensor turns out to be relevant for the discussion of the energy and momentum of moving media , especially of the isotropic ones .",
    "however , the angular momentum balance equation no longer has the form ( [ ab2 ] ) if the constitutive tensor depends on additional covariant material variables , and the final nice result ( [ marel ] ) is invalid then .",
    "the relevance of the abraham construction is thus limited .",
    "the complete century - long history of the discussion of the electromagnetic energy and momentum in moving media is still to be written . in this short paper",
    ", we presented a consistent viewpoint on this problem within the framework of the lagrange - noether approach .",
    "the canonical energy - momentum tensor appears then as a fundamental structure , together with the relevant balance equations of energy , momentum , and angular momentum .    by a detailed derivation ,",
    "we explicitly demonstrate that the angular momentum balance equation is always perfectly satisfied for the canonical tensor of the electromagnetic system when one takes care of the fact that it is an open system . even in absence of the intrinsic ( spin ) degrees of freedom ,",
    "the canonical energy - momentum tensor of an open system does not need to be symmetric , contrary to a widely spread misunderstanding .",
    "the minkowski energy - momentum tensor ( [ emte ] ) arises as a canonical structure in macroscopic maxwellian electrodynamics , which stresses its fundamental physical nature .",
    "the balance equation of an open electromagnetic system ( [ dtm ] ) contains nontrivial force terms . without specifying a model for the medium ,",
    "we demonstrate that the @xmath132 force ( [ x1 ] ) is related to the bound charges and currents , thus giving rise to the balance equation ( [ dt ] ) of the total canonical energy - momentum tensor ( [ emtt ] ) .",
    "its validity for the analysis of the crucial experiments was demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the @xmath132 force ( [ x1 ] ) can be reconstructed in terms of the material variables when a model of the medium is specified .",
    "we show how this works in the framework of the variational approach to the relativistic ideal fluid . here again the canonical energy - momentum ( [ emtf ] ) appears as a fundamental object .",
    "the interaction of matter with the electromagnetic field induces an additional field - dependent term in the material momentum ( [ pk ] ) superimposed with the usual hydrodynamical structures .",
    "the pressure ( [ peff ] ) picks up the electrostriction and magnetostriction contributions .",
    "in contrast to the canonical structures , the abraham energy - momentum tensor does not arise from first principles .",
    "we give a formal prescription that allows one to construct a symmetric tensor ( [ tadef ] ) from any given energy - momentum , provided a timelike vector field @xmath64 is available .",
    "unlike the other symmetrization procedures ( such as the belinfante - rosenfeld one , for example ) , the abrahamization does not preserve the balance equations , it rather introduces the additional forces in ( [ diff1 ] ) , ( [ diff2 ] ) . when applied to the minkowski tensor , this prescription yields the famous abraham electromagnetic energy - momentum ( [ emta ] ) .    nevertheless , despite its ad hoc definition",
    ", the abraham tensor turns out to be relevant since it resurfaces at the end from the sum of the two canonical energy - momenta of the electromagnetic and material systems in the eq .",
    "( [ ttot ] ) .",
    "it thus appears as a certain  hybrid \" construct that absorbs the explicit field - dependent terms from the canonical energy - momenta of the electromagnetic and material systems .",
    "this curious fact explains why the abraham tensor was for such a long time seriously competing with the minkowski tensor in the analyses of the numerous experiments @xcite .",
    "this result is not confined to the specific model with the constitutive relation ( [ chi1 ] ) , but holds in general for the class of constitutive tensor densities ( [ chi2 ] ) that depend arbitrarily on the material variables , provided the 4-velocity @xmath64 of the medium is the only lorentz - covariant object .",
    "this apparently confirms the recent observations of dereli , gratus and tucker @xcite that the abraham energy - momentum arises as the metrical energy - momentum tensor for media with a general constitutive relation .",
    "if we assume that the metric of spacetime is not the flat minkowski one but is a function of coordinates , the metric energy - momentum tensor density is defined by the variational derivative @xmath251 indeed , a ( long but straightforward ) computation then shows that @xmath252 for the model ( [ le ] ) , ( [ chi1 ] ) and ( [ lfluid ] ) of the isotropic moving medium above .",
    "there is a difference , strictly speaking , between our results since neither the lagrangian of the fluid nor the hydrodynamical part of the energy and momentum is discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to stress that the model of the medium above is by no means a general one . among its most serious limitations",
    "is that the elements of matter are assumed to be spinless .",
    "the extension of the model to the case of the nontrivial spin ( along the lines similar to those of @xcite ) can bring new insight into the subject , especially with regard to the effects of magnetism .",
    "my deep thanks go to friedrich hehl , with whom most of the results described above were obtained , for the constant discussions , support and advice .",
    "i am also grateful to bahram mashhoon for asking interesting and important questions . at the earlier stage , this work was supported partly by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( bonn ) with the grant he 528/21 - 1 .",
