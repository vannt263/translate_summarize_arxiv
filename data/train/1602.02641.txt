    "the coulomb repulsion between conduction electrons in conventional metals and semiconductors affects their properties only through the relatively weak effects of linear screening and corrections to the values of the landau fermi liquid parameters .",

    "if the density of conduction electrons could be lowered sufficiently to make electron interactions dominate over fermi energies , a wealth of interesting new quantum phenomena driven by strong many - body electron correlations are predicted to appear .",
    "these phenomena include :    * wigner crystal of electrons * charge density waves and other striped ground states * metal - insulator transition * quantum glass in the presence of defects * coherent superconductor and electron - hole superfluid quantum states * crossover from bcs superconductivity to bose - einstein condensation      a two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron layer is expected to have correlations that are stronger than the correlations in a corresponding three- dimensional system at the same density , because of the smaller kinetic energy contributions .",
