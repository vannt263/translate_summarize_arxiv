    "we suggest the following three stages . in stage 1 , the whole system is kept in the superconducting phase and thermal excitations in the superconducting circuits and josephson junctions should be suppressed @xcite .",
    "they are also associated with suppression of dissipation and decoherence . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the life time of the photons at this stage is already much longer than the operation time of the superconducting circuit by a factor about @xmath209 .    in stage 2 ,",
    "cooling of the tlr - qubit single site system should be performed before connecting the whole array .",
    "this is associated with the state preparation of the tlr array and a different degree of freedom from that of stage 1 needs to be dealt with .",
    "the quantum computation community has been making significant progresses related to the cooling at this stage @xcite .",
    "inspired by ideas from optical systems , sisyphus cooling and side - band cooling of superconducting systems have successfully cooled a qubit to its ground state @xcite .    in stage 3 , once a multi - site array is connected by turning on the hopping between adjacent sites , the desired many - body hamiltonian follows . in order to simulate and observe the quantum phase transition discussed here",
    ", one needs to constantly cool the system and keep the number of photons conserved during the operation .",
    "this is more challenging than cooling just a single site , especially inhomogeneity of the on - site energies is present .",
    "applying a bias or other manipulations of the parameters can cause excitations as well and need to be performed with care .",
    "moreover , to take out the heat from the multi - site system when operating near the critical regime leads to yet another issue .",
    "advanced schemes for cooling a single site have been available while cooling a multi - site array like the one studied here has not been reported so far .",
    "development of such technologies is important for realizing the proposed simulator .",
    "based on current ground - state preparations and state - manipulation technologies developed in coupled superconducting cavity systems @xcite , it is promising that photon - number - conserving ground - state cooling processes may be realized by scaling up the cooling methods for those coupled systems .",
    "_ detection of phase transition : _ since the single - site manipulations of the mi - sf transition exhibit strong signatures in the density distribution , we discuss a direct measurement of the photon numbers and number fluctuations on each site .",
    "interestingly , the measurement can be turned on and off when needed . as shown in figure [ measure circuit ] , each site can be coupled to a memory tlr via the additional circuit .",
    "the central squid - c is used to switch the coupling between the on - site unit and the measurement unit @xcite for controlling the memorizing window .",
    "this is possible by changing the bias flux through squid - c ( labeled on figure [ measure circuit ] ) , @xmath210 .",
    "a fast photon state swap between the two tlrs can be applied with four - wave mixing @xcite to get @xmath211 @xmath212 , so that the photons in the tlr of the simulator are transferred and stored into the measurement tlr .",
    "single photon state fast measurements can be applied to measure photon numbers in the memory tlr with technologies developed in circuit qed recently @xcite . by repeating the measurement",
    "one gets the average photon number @xmath213 and variation @xmath214 as depicted in figure [ ground state ] for detecting different quantum phases in the tlr array .    to summarize , a promising way to realize this simulation is : ( 1 ) tune the parameters in the mi regime and prepare the array in the ground state with an integer number of photons .",
    "( 2 ) adiabatically adjust the parameters to the desired values and cool the photons down to their ground state within the photon relaxation time .",
    "( 3 ) measure the photon number in each single site .",
    "then repeat ( 1 ) to ( 3 ) to obtain the average photon number and number fluctuations .",
    "a versatile quantum simulator of interacting bosons based on a tunable superconducting tlr - squid array has been presented .",
    "the bhm with tunable parameters on each site can be studied using the photons in this simulator .",
    "we have demonstrated the feasibility of inducing the mi - sf transition by manipulating only one single site .",
    "our results are further supported by the exact diagnolization method , and details of the transition with realistic parameters are presented .",
    "the fidelity metric , energy gap , and on - site photon number show signatures of the phase transition .",
    "we also discussed possible schemes for state preparation , cooling , and detection of the phase transition for this proposed simulator .",
    "besides the manipulations of the phase transition discussed here , this quantum simulator is also capable of demonstrating topological properties in the bhm with superlattice structures and should exhibit the topological properties , edge states , and topological phase transitions studied in refs .  .",
    "moreover , quantum quenches @xcite and their associated dynamics may also be simulated by this superconducting circuit simulator as well .",
    "for example , similar to ref .",
    "one can separate the tlr array into two sections by turning off the hopping between the two sections .",
    "then different photon numbers are prepared in the two sections . by switching on the hopping between the two sections ,",
    "photons are expected to slosh back and forth between the two sections , which should be detectable with similar measurement methods .",
    "thus the superconducting circuit simulator adds more excitement to the physics of interacting bosons and complements other available simulators .",
