    "the quantum dynamics of a single qubit or central spin coupled to a spin environment  @xcite has been widely studied theoretically in several different areas , including quantum information sciences  @xcite , quantum decoherence  @xcite , and excitation energy transfer  @xcite .",
    "one of the most promising candidates for quantum computation , solid - state spin systems , are inevitably coupled to their surrounding environment , usually through interactions with neighboring nuclear spins  @xcite .",
    "the coupling of a qubit to a spin bath can in general lead to non - markovian behavior  @xcite , causing the usual markovian quantum master equations to fail for such models .",
    "most recently , it was demonstrated for the first time that a spin bath can assist coherent transport in a two - level system  @xcite . fully understanding the role played by a spin environment",
    "is an interesting and important issue .",
    "one commonly studied qubit - spin bath system is the so - called spin - star network  @xcite , in which a preferred central spin is coupled homogeneously to a spin bath without intrabath interactions .",
    "a more realistic type of environment takes the form of quantum interacting spin chains  @xcite , where the decay of the qubit s coherence is found to be related to the critical properties of the spin environments .",
    "most prior work making use of such an environment considered qubit - spin bath coupling of the ising form , which is spin conserving . as a result , it is much easier to analytically obtain the full dynamics of the system , in contrast to the situation where a spin - flip coupling is present .",
    "exceptions include refs .",
    "@xcite , where the authors considered the spin - flip xx - type qubit - bath coupling but with a spin bath having homogeneous self - interactions , and ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors use @xmath0-dmrg to study the reduced dynamics of a qubit coupled locally to an xxz spin chain via the heisenberg - type qubit - bath interaction .",
    "it should be noted that , in general , both the spin - star network and the homogeneously coupled spin bath can be treated by introducing collective angular momentum operators which facilitates the analytical treatment . in this work",
    ", we will focus on a more realistic system with a ( not necessarily uniform ) spin - flip qubit - bath interaction as well as short range xx - type intrabath interactions . to our knowledge ,",
    "the exact dynamics of such a model , which is one step closer to faithfully representing environmental spins interacting via fully general heisenberg - type interactions , has not been obtained before .",
    "the collapse and revival ( cr ) behavior of rabi oscillations of a qubit coupled to a single bosonic field mode , described by the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model , is a fundamental consequence of field quantization and provides a much - studied illustration of the quantum nature of qubit - field systems  @xcite .",
    "using a correspondence between the jc model and a spin - star network with a large number of spins , it is found in ref .",
    "@xcite that within a certain parameter regime , cr phenomena also appear in a qubit - big spin model .",
    "@xcite goes beyond the resonant jc model to the nonresonant dicke model , and notes that the dynamics depends on the sign of the detuning between the qubit and field frequency .",
    "in this work , we extend the model studied in ref .",
    "@xcite to the nonresonant case with a self - interacting spin bath modeled by the periodic xx spin chain .",
    "it is found that both nonzero detuning and the nearest neighbor coupling within the xx bath can have an effect on the qubit s dynamics . in particular ,",
    "the interplay between nonresonance and intrabath interaction is able to reproduce cr behavior even for a spin bath with a relatively small number of sites .",
    "in addition , the dynamics of entanglement in many - body systems has recently been studied from different perspectives  @xcite . as interacting quantum spin systems",
    "are believed to be paradigmatic for quantum information processing  @xcite , their entanglement dynamics has attracted much attention  @xcite . in prior works , the dynamical behavior of pairwise entanglement",
    "is found to be related to quantum phase transitions of the spin chains .",
    "another emerging focus is on the evolution of the entanglement of a pair of qubits exposed to noisy environments . in a seminal work , yu and",
    "eberly  @xcite found that the markovian dynamics of the entanglement between two qubits coupled to individual bosonic baths can behave in sharp contrast to single qubit decoherence : the pairwise entanglement of two initially entangled two - level atoms suddenly disappears in a finite time proportional to the spontaneous lifetime of single atoms , while the single atom coherence only vanishes asymptotically .",
    "this phenomenon is called entanglement sudden death ( esd ) .",
    "more recently , it has been shown in the same setup that there exists a revival of the vanished entanglement if non - markovian effects are taken into account  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the non - markovian behavior caused by the spin environment may result in novel dynamics of the pairwise entanglement of two qubits each coupled to their own spin bath , as observed in a locally interacting qubit - spin - bath system  @xcite .",
    "esd and subsequent revivals have also been observed to occur in two qubits when they are coupled to _ classical _ interacting spin baths  @xcite and external fields  @xcite , the latter of which has been demonstrated experimentally  @xcite , and to stochastic noise sources  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , understanding the relation between decoherence and disentanglement is believed to be of importance both for the foundations of quantum mechanics and practical applications in quantum information science  @xcite . in this work , by taking the bath s initial state as the ground state of the xx chain , we first study the decoherence of a single qubit immersed in the xx bath .",
    "the decoherence dynamics is found to depend on the internal phases of the xx bath .",
    "the short time dynamics of the decoherence factor behaves like a gaussian , with the decay rate only depending on the filling number of the ground state of the bath . by considering two copies of our qubit - bath systems",
    ", we further study the disentanglement dynamics of the two initially entangled qubits coupled to their individual baths .",
    "we analytically show that the concurrence is bounded from above by the decoherence factor of a single qubit at all times .",
    "the initial bell state considered suffers from esd when the xx bath is in its critical phase .",
    "we also obtain the disentanglement time in the sudden death region and find that esd always occurs earlier than the onset of decoherence in a single qubit .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce our model hamiltonian and describe how to obtain the exact qubit - bath time - dependent wavefunctions in the momentum space of the xx spin chain . the components of the bloch vector of the qubit are obtained by tracing out the bath degrees of freedom over these total wavefunctions . the results for the nonresonant and interacting cases are presented . in sec .",
    "iii , we study single qubit decoherence in a single qubit - bath system and disentanglement of two initially entangled qubits in two independent qubit - bath systems .",

    "[ decmin ] and [ esd ] , indicating that the decoherence dynamics of a single qubit and the entanglement dynamics of two noninteracting qubits are linked , especially when the qubits are strongly coupled to their respective baths .",
    "in this work , we studied the reduced dynamics of a specific qubit - spin - bath model . unlike the spin conserving ising - type qubit - bath coupling utilized in most previous works , we considered an xx - type spin - flip qubit - bath coupling , which complicates the analytical analysis , since the system - bath interaction term does not commute with the rest of the hamiltonian .",
    "in addition , we model interactions in the bath by introducing nearest - neighbor xx - type couplings among the bath spins . such a model may be more physical than the non - interacting ` spin star ' and homogeneously interacting spin baths which have been examined before , but is more difficult to treat analytically .",
    "however , by mapping this xx chain into momentum space via the jordan - wigner transformation , we have shown how to obtain the equations of motion for the time - dependent total wavefunctions in momentum space .",
    "the reduced dynamics of a single qubit is then obtained by tracing out the bath degrees of freedom .    using the above results",
    ", we first studied the rabi oscillations of the qubit with the bath initially prepared in a spin coherent state .",
    "interestingly , the interplay between off - resonance and intrabath interactions was found to produce conventional collapse and revival behavior even for a relatively small spin bath size .",
    "we further discussed the bath - induced decoherence of a single qubit with the bath s initial state taken to be its ground state .",
    "we found that the decoherence properties of the qubit depend on the internal phases of the xx bath .",
    "specifically , the short time decay rate of the decoherence factor only depends on the filling number of the bath ground state .",
    "this result was confirmed through second order time - dependent perturbation theory . finally , we considered two independent copies of such qubit - bath subsystems and studied the disentanglement dynamics of two initially entangled qubits .",
    "the two qubits are always entangled if the xx bath is in its polarized state , whereas entanglement sudden death appears in the critical phase .",
    "qualitative similarities were observed between the time dependence of the two - qubit entanglement and the single - qubit decoherence factor , and we showed that the concurrence is bounded from above by the decoherence factor of the single qubit .",
    "however , for spin - boson type systems , it has been shown that this is not the case when the two - qubits share a common bosonic bath  @xcite .",
    "we believe that such a relation between single - qubit decoherence and two - qubit disentanglement might also break down for two qubits coupled to a common xx bath .",
    "this deserves further study based on our model system .",
    "the xx spin chain in our model is equivalent to the one - dimensional bose - hubbard model in the hard - core limit  @xcite , which can be realized using a cold atomic gas contained in an optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the qubit - spin - bath coupling @xmath14 can be mapped to a conventional spin - boson coupling within the rotating - wave approximation , @xmath248 , where @xmath249 are bosonic operators . regarding the methodology used in this work",
    ", we note that the only requirement for our formalism is the conservation of the total magnetization @xmath53 .",
    "thus , our method can also be applied to the nonuniform heisenberg type qubit - spin - bath coupling  @xcite , where the total magnetization is conserved .",
    "our results suggest that turning on interactions among bath spins can have markedly different effects on the decoherence and entanglement properties of the central spins , depending on how strongly they are coupled to their environment .",
    "therefore , this work may be of relevance to all efforts aimed at using such systems to construct quantum information processing devices",
