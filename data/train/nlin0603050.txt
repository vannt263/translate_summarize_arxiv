    "it is commonly known that the dynamics of nonlinear lattices are drastically different in generic nonintegrable systems , a paradigmatic example being the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dnls ; see reviews @xcite ) and in exceptional integrable models , a famous example of the latter being the ablowitz - ladik ( al ) equation @xcite . only in the latter case",
    "are exact solutions for soliton families available . in nonintegrable systems solitons",
    "are sought in a numerical form @xcite or by means of a variational approximation @xcite . as the difference between the dnls and al equations is in the type of the nonlinear terms  onsite or intersite",
    " it was quite natural to introduce a combined model that includes the cubic terms of both types , and thus allows one to consider a continuous transition between the al and dnls equations .",
    "the combined equation , known as the salerno model ( sm ) @xcite , is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the complex field amplitude at the @xmath2-th site of the lattice , the overdot stands for the time derivative , and real coefficients @xmath3 and @xmath4 account for the nonlinearities of the al and dnls types , respectively .",
    "the sm was studied in a number of other works , see refs . @xcite-@xcite and references therein .",
    "it is known that it conserves the norm and hamiltonian , @xmath5 @xmath6    in the above - mentioned works , it has been demonstrated that eq .",
    "( [ salerno ] ) gives rise to static ( and , sometimes , moving @xcite-@xcite ) solitons at all values of the dnls parameter @xmath4 , and all _ positive _ values of the al coefficient , @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath4 is negative , one can make it positive by means of the _ staggering transformation _",
    ", @xmath8 , and then setting @xmath9 , by the rescaling @xmath10 ( unless @xmath11 ) .",
    "however , the sign of @xmath7 can not be altered .",
    "in particular , the al model proper ( @xmath11 ) with @xmath12 does not give rise to solitons .",
    "the latter circumstance suggests considering soliton dynamics in the sm with @xmath12 , i.e. , with _",
    "competing nonlinearities _ , which is the subject of the present work . in this connection , it is necessary to stress that expressions ( [ eq : norm ] ) and ( [ eq : salernoenergy ] ) for the sm s dynamical invariants remain valid if @xmath13 takes negative values at some sites , due to @xmath12 .    while the sm was originally introduced in a rather abstract context , it has recently found direct physical realization , as an asymptotic form of the gross - pitaevskii equation describing a bose - einstein condensate of bosonic atoms with magnetic momentum trapped in a deep optical lattice @xcite . in that case , the onsite nonlinearity is generated , as usual , by collisions between atoms , while the intersite nonlinear terms account for the long - range dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "note that the latter interaction may be attractive ( @xmath14 ) or repulsive ( @xmath12 ) , if the external magnetic field polarizes the atomic momentum along the lattice or perpendicular to it , respectively .",
    "this report is organized as follows . in section [ sec : ca ] we develop a continuum approximation ( ca ) , and investigate the corresponding solitons in an analytical form .",
    "it is found that , although they might exist in a semi - infinite band of frequencies , they actually occupy a finite band , with an exact peakon solution at the edge of the band . a family of discrete solitons is constructed by means of numerical - continuation methods in section [ sec : stationary ] .",
    "they form a family of regular solitons , including a peakon , similar to what was found in the ca , but the lattice solitons extend beyond the peakon in the form of cuspons . in section [ subsec : stability ] ,",
    "the soliton stability is explored by means of standard floquet analysis ( computation of perturbation eigenvalues or floquet multipliers ) and in direct simulations , with the conclusion that only a small part of the family is unstable .",
    "two - soliton bound states are reported in section [ subsec : bound ] , where it is demonstrated that stability exchange between in - phase and out - of - phase states occurs at a point where the bound solitons are peakons . moving solitons",
    "are considered in section [ sec : mobile ] , where it is found that they exist up to a critical strength of the intersite self - defocusing nonlinearity , and collisions between them always lead to fusion into a single soliton .",
    "the paper is concluded in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "to introduce the ca in eq .",
    "( [ salerno ] ) , we define @xmath15 , and expand @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is now treated as a function of the continuous coordinate @xmath18 , which coincides with @xmath2 when it takes integer values . after that , the continuum counterpart of eq .",
    "( [ salerno ] ) is derived , @xmath19 where we have set @xmath20 and @xmath12 , as stated above .",

    "this form of the equation shows that solitons exist in a _ finite _ band of frequencies , @xmath32 , rather than in the entire semi - infinite band , @xmath33 , where the linearization of eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) produces exponentially decaying solutions that could serve as the solitons tails .",
    "the reduction of the semi - infinite band to a finite one is typical for soliton families in models with competing nonlinearities , such as the cubic - quintic nls equation @xcite .",
    "further , it follows from the divergence of potential ( [ potential ] ) at @xmath34 that the solitons s amplitude @xmath35 , which is a monotonously increasing function of @xmath36 , is smaller than @xmath37 for @xmath32 , and @xmath38 at @xmath39 .",
    "solitons can be found in an explicit form near the edges of the existence band : at small @xmath40 ( i.e. , small @xmath41 ) , @xmath42 , while precisely at the opposite edge of the band , @xmath43 ( i.e. , @xmath39 ) , the exact solution is a _",

    "( [ psi ] ) is valid if the intrinsic scale of all continuum solutions , that may be estimated through the curvature of the soliton s profile at @xmath49 as @xmath50 , is large , @xmath51 ( recall the lattice spacing is @xmath52 in the present notation ) .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ peakon ] ) , the latter condition implies @xmath53 ( i.e. , strictly speaking , the ca applies in the case when the competing nonlinearities in the sm nearly cancel each other ) .",
    "it is relevant to note that , in the usually considered  non - competitive \" version of the sm , with @xmath54 ( i.e. , self - focusing intersite nonlinearity ) , the ca yields solitons in the entire semi - infinite band , @xmath25 .",
    "in order to find discrete solitons in a numerical form , we looked for solutions to eq .",
    "( [ salerno ] ) which are localized and time periodic with frequency @xmath55 @xcite ( that is related to @xmath45 in the continuum equation by @xmath56 ) .",
    "soliton solutions of this form are widely known for the dnls limit ( @xmath57 ) and hence it is posible to make a numerical continuation of such solutions for @xmath58 by adiabatic changes of the model parameter @xmath59 and successive applications of the shooting method @xcite . for this purpose",
    "we consider soliton solutions of the above form as fixed points of the map @xmath60 defined as @xmath61 _ i.e _",
    "@xmath62 is the time - evolution operator over @xmath63 of dynamics dictated by eq .",
    "( [ salerno ] ) .",
    "then , using usual techniques for finding fixed points of maps ( such as _ e.g. _ the newton - raphson algorithm ) we can find the numerically exact soliton for a given frequency @xmath64 and @xmath59 .",
    "in general all the soliton solutions were computed starting from the dnls limit , @xmath65 , and increasing @xmath66 at a fixed value of @xmath67 .",
    "the continuations were performed using the shooting method , with an increment @xmath68 at each step , or smaller if higher accuracy was needed .    as shown in the previous section",
    ", the soliton family in the continuum equation ( [ psi ] ) ends with the peakon  solution ( [ peakon ] ) . to compare the numerically determined shape of the discrete solitons with the feasible peakon limit",
    ", we fitted the solitons tails to the asymptotic form , @xmath69 , with constant @xmath35 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 , which follows from the linearized equation ( [ salerno ] ) for large @xmath72 .",
    "this procedure yielded the decay rate , @xmath73 , amplitude , @xmath74 ( and the center s position @xmath71 ) , as functions of parameters @xmath7 and @xmath67 of the soliton family . once @xmath75 and @xmath71 were found , we defined @xmath76 @xmath77 to measure a deviation of the true discrete soliton from a conjectured peakon shape obtained by formal extension of the tail inward .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) we show the evolution of @xmath78 produced by several continuations of the lattice - soliton solutions ( at different frequencies @xmath67 ) .",

    "[ fig:1](b ) we plot the evolution of the soliton s amplitude as the continuation is performed .",
    "it is observed that the amplitude increases with @xmath66 , reaching the predicted value , @xmath37 , at the exact peakon solution .    a noteworthy result , evident from fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , is the persistence of the discrete solitons _ beyond the peakon limit _",
    "( which means continuability of the solutions to @xmath82 ) .",
    "the apparent intersection of different curves at one point in fig[fig:1](a ) is a spurious feature ( see the inset in the figure ) : an accurate consideration shows that the curves actually intersect at close but different points .",
    "in contrast , the intersection of the curves in fig . [ fig:1](b ) indeed happens at a single point , which corresponds to the discrete solitons taking the peakon shape .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] displays typical examples of the numerically found discrete solitons .",
    "it demonstrates that the solutions corresponding to @xmath83 are _ cuspons _ , with a super - exponential shape , that do not exist in the continuum equation ( [ psi ] ) .",
    "the discrete character of the sm with the competing nonlinearities allows this new type of solution ( as happens with the quasi - collapsing states in the standard dnls equation in two dimensions @xcite ) .",
    "cuspon solutions continue into the region of @xmath27 , where the ca yields no solitons , but , due to the sharp change of the solution with the increase of @xmath66 , finding numerical solutions at larger values of @xmath66 becomes increasingly more difficult .",

    "[ fig:3](a ) we compare the line of the existence of the peakons in the continuum limit , and the actual location of discrete peakons .",
    "it is seen that the agreement between the ca and numerical findings is good for smaller @xmath84 ( in this case , the discrete solitons are broad ) , while at larger @xmath84 the discrete solitons are narrow , hence the agreement with the ca deteriorates .",
    "we have performed stability analysis of the discrete solitons by computing eigenvalues ( floquet multipliers , @xmath85 ) for modes of small perturbations @xcite , within the framework of the linearized equation of the sm ( [ salerno ] ) .",
    "the integration of a basis of initial perturbations over a period @xmath63 of the discrete soliton gives the floquet matrix that in our case is real and symplectic so that its eigenvalues come in quadruplets @xmath86 .",
    "then , the discrete soliton solution to eq.([salerno ] ) is linearly stable if all the floquet multipliers lie on the unit circle of the complex plane , @xmath87 .",
    "it is found that the solitons are linearly stable along the whole continuation , except for a relatively small region , as shown in fig . [ fig:4](a ) .",
    "the entire instability island in the @xmath88 plane is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](b ) .",
    "note , in particular , that the peakon and cuspon solutions are stable .",
    "the stability of the discrete solitons was also checked by direct simulations of perturbed solitons , using the full equation ( [ salerno ] ) , which corroborated the predictions of the linear analysis .",
    "cc    direct simulations of the evolution of perturbed unstable solitons , a typical example of which is displayed in fig .",

    "the pulsons are ( quasi-)periodic in time , and persist indefinitely .",
    "this behavior resembles that found in the ordinary two - dimensional dnls equation in quasi - collapsing states @xcite .    a necessary stability condition for soliton families in models of the nls type",
    "may be provided by the vakhitov - kolokolov ( vk ) criterion @xcite : if the norm @xmath89 of the soliton is known as a function of its frequency @xmath64 , the solitons can be stable against small perturbations with real eigenvalues , provided that @xmath90@xmath91 . although the applicability of the vk criterion to the present model has not been proven ( and counter - examples",
    "are known , when solitons predicted by the criterion to be unstable are actually stable @xcite ) , it is relevant to test the criterion here , numerically computing @xmath92 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : norm ] ) .",
    "the result is that the vk  criterion _ precisely _ explains the stability and instability of the discrete solitons , except for the cuspons ( see below ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](c ) .",
    "a noteworthy feature of the @xmath93 dependence is a divergence of the total norm due to the infinite contribution of the central site to expression ( [ eq : norm ] ) in the case of the exact peakon solution , with @xmath94 .",
