    "in the past decade , energy self - localization in nonlinear dynamical lattices , leading to the formation of soliton - like _ intrinsic localized modes _ ( ilms ) , has become a topic of intense theoretical and experimental research .",
    "much of this work has already been summarized in several reviews @xcite .",
    "it was proposed that this mechanism would be relevant to a number of effects such as nonexponential energy relaxation in solids @xcite , local denaturation of the dna double strand @xcite , behavior of amorphous materials @xcite , propagation of light beams in coupled optical waveguides @xcite or the self - trapping of vibrational energy in proteins @xcite , among others .",
    "ilms also have potential significance in some crystals , like acetanilide and related organics @xcite .",
    "the theoretical efforts were complemented by a number of important experimental works suggesting the presence and importance of the ilms in magnetic @xcite and complex electronic materials @xcite , dna denaturation @xcite , as well as in coupled optical waveguide arrays @xcite and josephson ladders @xcite .",
    "a ubiquitous model system for the study of ilms is the discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation ( see e.g. , the review @xcite and references therein ) . within the framework of this model and , more generally , for klein - gordon lattices , it has recently been recognized that physically realistic setups require consideration of the ilm dynamics in higher spatial dimensions @xcite . in the most straightforward two - dimensional ( 2d ) case , almost all of these studies , with the exception of refs .",
    "@xcite were performed for square lattices .",
    "however , it was stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite that non - square geometries may be relevant to a variety of applications , ranging from the explanation of dark lines in natural crystals of muscovite mica , to sputtering ( ejection of atoms from a crystal surface bombarded by high - energy particles ) , and , potentially , even to high - temperature superconductivity in layered cuprates .",
    "besides that , it has been well recognized that triangular ( ta ) and hexagonal ( or _ honeycomb _ , hc ) lattices are relevant substrate structures in a number of chemical systems @xcite and , especially , in photonic band - gap ( pbg ) crystals @xcite .",
    "notice that , in the context of the pbg crystals , the relevance of nonlinear effects has been recently highlighted for a square diatomic lattice @xcite .",
    "the above discussion suggests the relevance of a systematic study of ilms in the paradigm dnls model for ta and hc lattices .",
    "the aim of the present work is to address this issue ( including the stability of the ilm solutions ) , for the 2d lattices with both short - range and long - range interactions . in section",
    "ii we discuss the effects of the non - square lattice geometry on the fundamental ilm state ( the one centered on a lattice site ) , and then explore effects of long - range interactions on this state . in section iii , we expand our considerations to other classes of solutions , which are either more general ones , such as twisted modes , which are also known in square lattices , or represent states that are specific to the ta and hc structures , viz . , discrete vortices .",
    "we identify stable fundamental vortices in the ta and hc lattices with vorticity ( spin ) @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and with the hexagonal and honeycomb shape , respectively .",
    "additionally , a triangular vortex is found in the hc lattice , but it is always unstable .",
    "in this work we consider the two - dimensional dnls equation with the on - site cubic nonlinearity , @xmath2 the subscripts ( @xmath3 ) attached to the complex ( envelope ) field @xmath4 are two discrete spatial coordinates , @xmath5 is the constant of the linear coupling between nearest - neighbor sites , the summation over which is denoted by @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the coordination number ( i.e. , the number of the nearest neighbors ) , which takes the values @xmath8 for the ta lattice ( see the left panel of fig . [ hfig1 ] ) , @xmath9 for the square lattice , and @xmath10 for the hc one ( see the right panel of fig . [ hfig1 ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath11 represents a kernel of the long - range linear coupling , and @xmath12 is the lattice spacing .",
    "it is worth noting here that the ta network is a simple bravais lattice with the coordinates of the grid nodes @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( see also ref .",
    "the same is true for the most commonly used square lattice , which has @xmath15 , @xmath16 , but _ not _ for the hc structure , a simple representation of which ( for @xmath17 ) is @xmath18 , @xmath19 $ ] . more information on the latter structure ( which also represents , for instance , the arrangement of carbon atoms in a layer of graphite ) and its symmetries can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "first , we will look for ilm solutions of the nearest - neighbor version of the model , setting @xmath20 .",
    "stationary solutions with a frequency @xmath21 are sought for in the ordinary form ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath22 the substitution of eq .",
    "( [ heq2 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ heq1 ] ) leads to a time - independent equation for the amplitudes @xmath23 .",
    "the stationary solution being known , one can perform the linear - stability analysis around it in the same way as it has been done for the square lattice @xcite , assuming a perturbed solution in the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a perturbation with an infinitesimal amplitude @xmath26 .",
    "deriving the leading - order equation for @xmath25 , and looking for a relevant solution to it in the form @xmath27 ( where the eigenfrequency @xmath28 is , generally speaking , complex ) , one arrives at an eigenvalue problem for @xmath29 : @xmath30    the inclusion of long - range effects into the linear - stability equations is straightforward . as the long - range coupling is accounted for by a linear operator acting on the complex field , terms @xmath31 and @xmath32 are to be added to eqs .",
    "( [ heq4 ] ) and ( [ heq5 ] ) , respectively .",
    "fundamental ( single - site - centered ) ilm solutions to the stationary equations were constructed by means of a newton - type method , adjusted to the non - square geometry of the ta and hc lattice . for the results presented",
    "herein , we fix the frequency to be @xmath33 and vary the coupling constant @xmath5 , as one of the two parameters ( @xmath34 and @xmath5 ) can always be scaled out from the stationary equations .",
    "we started from obvious single - site solutions ( with @xmath35 ) at the anti - continuum limit corresponding to @xmath36 @xcite , and then continued the solution to finite @xmath5 .",
    "subsequently , the stability analysis was performed using eqs .",
    "( [ heq4])-([heq5 ] ) for the corresponding lattice .",
    "typical examples of stable and unstable fundamental ilms found in both the ta and hc lattices are displayed , by means of contour plots , in fig .",
    "[ hfig4 ] .",
    "the top panel of the figure shows , respectively , stable and unstable solutions , together with the associated spectral - plane diagrams ( showing the imaginary vs. real parts of the eigenfrequencies ) , for the ta lattice with @xmath37 ( top subplots ) and @xmath38 ( bottom subplots ) .",
    "stable and unstable solutions in the hc lattice are shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ hfig4 ] for @xmath37 ( top subplots ) and at @xmath39 ( bottom subplots ) .",
    "a natural way to understand the stability of the ilms is to trace the evolution and bifurcations of the eigenfrequencies and associated eigenmodes with the increase of the nearest - neighbor coupling @xmath5 .",
    "for the square lattice , we find , in line with results of refs .",
    "@xcite , that a bifurcation generating an internal mode from the edge of the continuous spectrum ( the edge is at @xmath40 ) in the corresponding ilm occurs at a critical value @xmath41 . as the coupling is further increased , the pair of the corresponding eigenfrequencies moves towards the origin of the spectral plane , where they collide and bifurcate into an unstable pair of imaginary eigenfrequencies at @xmath42 ( i.e. , at @xmath43 in the present notation ) , so that the ilm in the square lattice is unstable for @xmath44 .    in the ta and hc lattices ,",
    "the scenario is found to be quite similar .",
    "for the former lattice , the bifurcation of the two eigenfrequencies from the continuous band edge ( which is depicted by the dash - dotted line ) and their trajectory , as they change from real , i.e. , stable ( the solid line ) into imaginary , i.e. , unstable ( the dashed line ) , are shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ hfig2 ] .",
    "the bottom panel shows the same trajectory for the hc lattice . the pair of eigenvalues bifurcates at @xmath45 in the ta lattice , and they reach the origin , giving rise to the instability , at a point close to @xmath46 . in the hc lattice ,",
    "the bifurcation giving rise to the originally stable eigenvalues occurs at @xmath47 ; they collide at the origin and become unstable at @xmath48 .",
    "one can clearly identify the effect of geometry in these results .",
    "in particular , since the instability occurs beyond the critical values of the coupling , it is the linear interaction between the neighbors that drives it .",
    "consequently , since the coordination numbers for the different lattices are ordered as @xmath49 , the instability thresholds ( critical values of the coupling constant ) for these lattices should be ordered conversely , @xmath50 .",
    "a similar understanding of the effect of the coordination number on the norm of the solution , @xmath51 , justifies the results displayed in fig .",
    "[ hfig3 ] : the larger number of neighbors endows the ta branch ( solid line ) with a larger norm than the square one ( dash - dotted ) , which , in turn , has a larger norm than the hc lattice ( dashed ) .      recently , a lattice model with a long - range coupling , which is relevant to magnon - phonon , magnon - libron and exciton - photon interactions , was introduced in ref . @xcite . in the framework of this model , it has been concluded that the relevant coupling kernel [ see eq.([heq1 ] ) ] is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is an amplitude of the kernel , @xmath54 measures the range of the interaction , and @xmath55 is the modified bessel function .",
    "we will use this kernel below .    inserting the kernel ( [ heq6 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ heq1 ] ) , one can see how the behavior of the branch is modified as a function of @xmath53 for a given fixed value of the nearest - neighbor coupling @xmath5 .",
    "notice that similar results ( but on a logarithmic scale ) will be obtained if @xmath56 is varied , while @xmath57 is kept fixed , as it was detailed in ref .",
    "thus , we fix @xmath58 hereafter .    in fig .",
    "[ hfig5 ] , we show the evolution of the numerically found internal - mode eigenvalues of ilm as a function of @xmath53 , for fixed @xmath37 . it can be observed that the increase of @xmath53 leads to an instability for @xmath59 .",
    "the bottom panel shows the configuration and its internal - eigenmode frequency for @xmath60 , when the configuration is already unstable . carefully zooming into the ilm s in the case of long - range interactions ( data not shown here )",
    ", one can notice a `` tail '' of the ilm , much longer than the size of the ilm in the case of the nearest - neighbor interaction , which is a natural consequence of the nonlocal character of the interaction in the present case .",
    "for @xmath61 , we thus conclude that the long - range interaction `` cooperates '' with the short - range one , lowering the instability threshold . on the contrary ,",
    "numerical results for @xmath62 show that the onset of the instability is _ delayed _ when the long- and short - range interactions compete with each other ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    one can extend the above considerations to the case where both @xmath53 and @xmath63 are varied and construct two - parameter diagrams , separating stability and instability regions .",
    "an example is shown for the ta lattice in fig .",
    "[ hfig5a ] . for a fixed @xmath5 ,",
    "the critical value @xmath64 was identified , beyond which the ilm is unstable .",
    "thus , in fig . [ hfig5a ] ilm s are stable below the curve and unstable above it .",
    "we now turn our attention to solutions comprising many sites of the lattice . in this case too , the solutions are initially constructed in the anti - continuum limit @xmath36 , and then extended through continuation to finite values of @xmath5 .",
    "firstly , we examine the so - called twisted localized modes ( tlms ) , which were originally introduced , in the context of 1d lattices , in refs .",
    "later , they were studied in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , and their stability was analyzed in ref .",
    "they were subsequently used to construct topologically charged 2d solitons ( vortices ) in the square - lattice dnls equation in @xcite .    in the case of the square lattice , and",
    "subject to the same normalization as adopted above , i.e. , with @xmath33 , tlms are found to be stable for @xmath65 .",
    "if the coupling exceeds this critical value , an oscillatory instability , which is manifested through a quartet of complex eigenvalues @xcite , arises due to the collision of the tlm s internal mode with the continuous spectrum ( the two have opposite _ krein signatures _",
    "@xcite ) , as it has been detailed in ref .",
    "the same scenario is found to occur in the ta lattice .",
    "however , in the latter case the oscillatory instability sets in at @xmath66 , and the destabilization is a result of the collision of the eigenvalues with those that have ( slightly ) bifurcated from the continuous spectrum ( rather than with the edge of the continuous spectrum at @xmath67 , as in the square lattice ) .",
    "similarly , in the hc lattice , the instability of tlms sets in at @xmath68 . notice that the instability thresholds follow the same ordering as the ones discussed in the previous section .",
    "this can be justified by a similar line of arguments as given before .",
    "the tlm in the ta lattice ( and its stability ) is displayed in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ hfig6 ] for @xmath69 , which exceeds the instability threshold .",
    "the bottom panel of the figure shows the variation ( as a function of the coupling @xmath5 ) of the critical eigenfrequency .",
    "the real stable eigenfrequency , and the imaginary part of the unstable ones , after the threshold has been crossed , are shown , respectively , by solid and dashed lines .",
    "figure [ hfig6a ] displays analogous results for the hc lattice .",
    "the solution is shown at @xmath69 in the top panel .",
    "it should be remarked that , in the 2d lattice , the tlms are solutions carrying vorticity ( topological charge ) @xmath70 @xcite ( although they are different from vortices proper , see below ) . the simplest way to see",
    "this is by recognizing that tlm configurations emulate the continuum - limit expression @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the angular coordinate in the 2d plane , i.e. , the real part of @xmath73 , the latter expression carrying vorticity @xmath74 .",
    "it should also be added that , after the onset of the oscillatory instability , tlm solutions have been found to transform themselves into the fundamental ( single - site - centered ) ilm configurations , which is possible as the topological charge is not a dynamical invariant in lattices @xcite .",
    "going beyond tlms , it is appropriate to consider possible lattice solitons which conform to the symmetry of the ta or hc lattice .",
    "in fact , these are the most specific dynamical modes supported by the lattices .",
    "an example of this sort in the ta lattice are `` hexagonal '' ilms shown in fig .",
    "[ hfig8 ] .",
    "the top panel of the figure shows the profile of these modes in the anti - continuum limit , and the bottom panel displays two actual examples of these modes .",
    "the top subplot shows the hexagonal ilm for @xmath75 , when it is stable , while the bottom subplot shows the mode at @xmath76 , after the onset of three distinct oscillatory instabilities .",
    "the first and second instabilities set in at @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively , while the final eigenvalue quartet appears at @xmath79 .    measuring the topological charge of this solution around the contour in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ hfig7 ] , we find ( since each jump from @xmath80 to @xmath81 can be identified as a @xmath82 phase change ) that the whole solution has a total phase change of @xmath83 , hence its topological charge ( vorticity , or `` spin '' ) is @xmath0 .",
    "then , the presence of three oscillatory instabilities agrees with a recent conjecture @xcite , which states that the number of negative - krein - sign eigenvalues ( and hence the number of potential oscillatory instabilities ) coincides with the topological charge of the 2d lattice soliton .",
    "however , if one examines more carefully the stability picture , one finds that , due to the symmetry of the solution , two of these eigenvalues have multiplicity @xmath84 .",
    "hence , the conjecture needs to be refined , to take into regard the potential presence of symmetries .",
    "the thus revised conjecture states that the topological charge of the solution should be equal to the geometric ( but not necessarily algebraic ) multiplicity of the eigenvalues with negative krein signature .",
    "it is natural to ask then to what configuration this hexagonal ilm will relax once it becomes unstable . to address the issue , we performed direct numerical simulations for @xmath76 .",
    "results are shown in our subplots of fig .",
    "[ hfig8 ] .",
    "in particular , the top left panel shows the solution at @xmath85 ( the configuration at @xmath86 was the unstable hexagonal ilm ) .",
    "it can clearly be observed that the instability that sets in around @xmath87 ( according to the other three subplots ) transforms the hexagonal vortex into a fundamental ( zero - vorticity ) ilm ; recall that such an outcome of the instability development is possible because the vorticity is _ not _ conserved in lattice systems @xcite .    for the hc lattice ,",
    "a vortex soliton of a triangular form was found , see an example in fig .",
    "[ hfig9 ] for @xmath88 .",
    "we have found that this solution is unstable for _ all values _ of @xmath5 .",
    "another vortex soliton , with a honeycomb shape , was also found in the hc lattice , see fig .",
    "[ hfig10 ] .",
    "this one is _",
    "stable _ at a sufficiently weak coupling .",
    "if a contour is drawn around this solution ( shown in the top panel of the figure for the anti - continuum limit ) , the net phase change is found to be @xmath89 , hence the corresponding topological charge is @xmath1 . in accordance with",
    "the conjecture mentioned above , when the solution is stable , we find five internal modes with negative krein signature .",
    "these modes eventually lead , as the coupling is increased , to five oscillatory instabilities . in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ hfig10 ] , the top subplot shows the case with @xmath90 , when the honeycomb - shaped vortex soliton in the hc lattice is linearly stable .",
    "the bottom subplot features the presence of five eigenvalue quartets in the case @xmath91 , when all five oscillatory instabilities have been activated .",
    "the first instability occurs at @xmath92 , the second at @xmath93 , the third at @xmath94 , the fourth at @xmath95 , and the fifth sets in at @xmath96 .    to illustrate the result of the development of the instability of the latter vortex in the case in which it is unstable",
    ", we have again resorted to direct numerical integration of eq .",
    "( [ heq1 ] ) .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ hfig11 ] for @xmath91 . at @xmath97 ,",
    "only one main pulse is sustained .",
    "hence , in this case too , the multiply charged topological soliton is transformed , through the instability , into the stable ( for this value of @xmath5 ) fundamental zero - vorticity ilm .",
    "in this work , we have studied a paradigm nonlinear lattice dynamical model , namely the dnls equation , in two spatial dimensions for non - square lattices .",
    "the triangular and honeycomb networks were considered , as the most important examples of bravais and non - bravais 2d lattices , which are relevant to chemical and optical applications .    in the case of nearest - neighbor interactions , it was found that the instability thresholds for the fundamental solution centered at a single lattice site depend on the coordination number .",
    "the instability appears in the triangle lattice at a smaller value of the coupling constant than in the square lattice , while the opposite is true for the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the effect of the long - range interactions was also examined in this context .",
    "it was found that these interactions accelerate or delay the onset of the instability if they have the same sign as the nearest - neighbor coupling , or the opposite sign .",
    "diagrams in the two - parameter plane were constructed , identifying regions of stability and instability in the presence of both the short- and long - range coupling .",
    "more complicated lattice solitons , which essentially extend to several lattice sites , were also examined .",
    "a prototypical example of the extended solitons are twisted modes , for which the phenomenology was found to be similar to that in the square lattice , but with , once again , appropriately shifted thresholds .",
    "we have also examined solutions with a higher topological charge , which play the role of fundamental vortices in the triangular and honeycomb lattices , their vorticity being , respectively , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "stability of these vortices was studied in detail .",
    "when instabilities occurred , their outcome was examined by means of direct time integration , showing the transformation into a simple fundamental soliton with zero vorticity .",
    "further steps in the study of localized modes in these nonlinear lattices may address traveling discrete solitons , as well as generalization to the three - dimensional case . in terms of applications , a relevant object are nonlinear photonic band - gap crystals based on non - square lattices .",
