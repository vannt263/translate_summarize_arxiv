    "the tree - like phase is inside the linear region and the two lines are quite close in the area of interest ( near @xmath168 ) . using the phase line as an approximation to the location of the phase transition in the full model we can estimate the point at which it intercepts the boundary of the magnetized region .",
    "although we do not know exactly where the critical line separating the magnetized and unmagnetized phases lies , we have that @xmath169 for the single spin ising model  @xcite and we know from monte carlo simulations  @xcite that @xmath170 only increases slowly with @xmath0 .",
    "taking @xmath171 gives an estimate of @xmath172 , but this is likely to be an over - estimate since the phase line changes rapidly with @xmath32 and the value of @xmath32 that we are using is too small ( it corresponds to the critical coupling for @xmath173 ) .",
    "an estimate using our old criterion based on the knee would give a value of @xmath21 .",
    "overall then we conclude that @xmath21  @xmath5 and that the corresponding value of the central charge , above which there exists a tree - like phase in the full model , is @xmath6  @xmath7 .",

    "in fig  [ fig : phase ] we have drawn some possible forms for the phase diagram of model  i. the magnetized region is labelled m , the tree - like region t and the remaining unmagnetized non - tree - like region u. if the critical line in the two - term model were an accurate representation of that in the full model then the correct phase diagram would be fig  [ fig : phase]a .",
    "however , one expects that as more terms are included in the truncated model the location of the critical line will change and it is not entirely clear where point a will move to .",
    "it is possible that a tends towards the @xmath153 axis as more terms are added in which case fig  [ fig : phase]b would be the correct diagram .",
    "other possibilities , such as fig  [ fig : phase]c or the absence of a tree - like region , can not be entirely ruled out , but seem unlikely given the results presented in this letter and those due to wexler  @xcite .",
    "( 140,120)(0,0 )    the two - term model has a third order transition with @xmath174 on the critical line ac and the full model may well show the same behaviour .",
    "it is interesting to note that the model in reference  @xcite also has @xmath174 on the line separating the branched polymer and unmagnetized phases ( in this model @xmath175 at the point where the three phases meet ) .",
    "the order of magnitude estimate of @xmath21@xmath5 ( point c in fig  [ fig : phase ] ) is similar to the largest value of @xmath0 ( ie @xmath176 ) used in simulations so far .",
    "it is to be hoped that future simulations will manage to locate the onset of the branched polymer phase .",
    "one should note that our estimate of @xmath163 is not sufficiently accurate to exclude the possibility that @xmath177 , although numerical simulations seem to rule this out . in conclusion then , significant progress has been made in elucidating the nature of the phase diagram for the multiple ising model on dynamical planar 3 graphs , in particular in the large @xmath0 limit , but much work remains to be done before the nature of the @xmath9 barrier is fully understood .",
