    "<S> moreover , a number of authors have attributed a strong connection of instantons with chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite as well as the hadron and glueball spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> however , there are also very important short - distance implications   of qcd instantons :    they are known to induce certain processes which violate chirality in accord with the general axial - anomaly relation  @xcite and which are forbidden in conventional perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> of particular interest in this context is the deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) regime . here </S>",
    "<S> , hard instanton - induced processes may both be calculated   within instanton - perturbation theory and possibly be detected experimentally  @xcite . since an experimental discovery of instanton - induced events would clearly be of basic significance , our ongoing theoretical and phenomenological study of the discovery potential of instanton - induced dis events is well motivated .    on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> there has been much recent activity in the lattice community to `` measure '' topological fluctuations in lattice simulations  @xcite of qcd . </S>",
    "<S> being independent of perturbation theory , such simulations provide `` snapshots '' of the qcd vacuum including all possible non - perturbative features like instantons . </S>",
    "<S> they may be exploited to provide crucial support for important prerequisites of calculations in dis , like the validity of instanton - perturbation theory and the dilute instanton - gas approximation for small instantons of size @xmath7 fm . along these lines </S>",

    "<S> this fact illustrates the great importance of lattice simulations for @xmath8-induced scattering processes and largely motivates the present analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> * 3 . * before turning to our concrete analysis , we first have to address various topical problems associated with lattice data on instantons . </S>",

    "<S> however , in the raw data , ultraviolet fluctuations of wavelength @xmath73 dominate and completely mask the topological effects which are expected to be of much larger size . in order to make the latter visible , a certain `` cooling '' procedure has to be applied first . </S>",
    "<S> cooling is a technique for removing the high - frequency non - topological excitations of the gauge - field , while affecting the topological fluctuations of much longer wavelength @xmath74 comparatively little . after cooling , @xmath8 s and @xmath71 s </S>",
    "<S> can clearly be identified as bumps in the topological charge density and the lagrange density . by applying sophisticated pattern - recognition algorithms , various distributions characterizing the ensemble of @xmath8 s and @xmath71 s </S>",
    "<S> may be extracted .    </S>",
    "<S> however , during cooling instantons are also removed ; either if they are very small ( lattice artifacts ) or through @xmath75 annihilation . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , so called under - relaxed ( or slow ) cooling is used to reduce the latter problem . </S>",
    "<S> generically , the cooling procedure introduces substantial uncertainties in the extraction of physical information on the topological structure of the qcd vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> no objective criterium is yet available on the quantitative amount of `` vacuum damage '' introduced by it ( see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> since one is interested in the physics of the uncooled vacuum , it appears suggestive ( at first ) to try and extrapolate  @xcite the measured distributions to the limit of a vanishing number of cooling sweeps , @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> however , to do so would be to ignore the fact that the pattern - recognition procedures become increasingly unreliable near that limit , since the extracted instanton density appears to strongly increase for decreasing @xmath77 . below a certain minimal number of cools , @xmath78 , </S>",
    "<S> even the total topological charge @xmath79 starts to deviate from the _ plateau _ value it has for a whole range of larger @xmath77 .    </S>",
    "<S> in view of these objections , we follow the alternative strategy of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to extract information about the physical vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> the method incorporates certain scaling studies that are important for the continuum limit @xmath80 and consists in the following steps : first , at @xmath70 , say , one picks the smallest number of cooling sweeps for which the pattern - recognition starts to become reliable and the cooling history of the total topological charge enters a plateau . for straight cooling , one finds @xmath81 corresponding to @xmath82 under - relaxed cools  @xcite . the next step is to search for further , so - called _ equivalent _ pairs @xmath83 , for which shape and normalization of specific distributions ( expressed in physical unitsfor consistency and minimization of uncertainties , one should use only a single dimensionful quantity to relate lattice units and physical units . throughout our analysis , </S>",
    "<S> all dimensions are therefore expressed by the so - called sommer scale  @xcite @xmath84 , with @xmath85 fm , which we prefer over the string tension  @xcite . ] ) essentially remain the same ( see also ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the result of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite were the pairs @xmath86 . with these equivalent , _ scaling _ data sets , the continuum limit </S>",
    "<S> is then performed with hopefully little `` vacuum damage '' due to cooling .    yet </S>",
    "<S> , the crucial question remains at this point , whether the choice @xmath87 as a `` starting pair '' for the equivalent data is somehow distinguished , i.e. _ physically _ meaningful . in this context , let us present an intriguing line of arguments :    `` equivalent '' data should first of all be characterized by a similar amount of cooling . for @xmath77 cooling sweeps , an effective `` cooling radius '' @xmath88 in physical units@xmath89 </S>",
    "<S> may be defined , via a ( qualitative ) random walk argument , as @xmath90 the three equivalent pairs @xmath83 above , indeed , turn out to have a very similar value of @xmath88 ( see table  [ coolrad ] ) .

    "<S> [ scaling ] , we illustrate that the average instanton size @xmath96 in physical units from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , for _ all _ available values of ( @xmath91 ) , fits onto a _ </S>",
    "<S> single _    </S>",
    "<S> smooth curve as function of @xmath88 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rcool ] ) with @xmath97 small . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , one obtains three widely spaced curves , if @xmath98 is displayed as a function of @xmath99 alone for fixed @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the same scaling with @xmath88 holds practically for all quantities extracted in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , characterizing the instanton ensemble on the lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> perhaps the most striking feature of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ scaling ] is the clear indication of a _ plateau _ corresponding to @xmath102 fm . </S>",
    "<S> let us try to provide some interpretation for it . </S>",
    "<S> suppose , the localized fluctuations on the lattice are a mixture of two distinct ensembles , separated by a certain gap in their respective average sizes . for example , one expects fluctuations that are lattice artifacts typically located around smaller sizes @xmath103 , while the physical instanton sizes are peaking around @xmath104 fm . </S>",
    "<S> by gradually increasing the cooling radius @xmath88 , we first filter out the smaller artifacts , leading clearly to a corresponding increase in the effective @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> when the radius of our filter further increases , one then expects a _ plateau _ in @xmath96 to indicate that the small artifacts have been mostly wiped out , while the much larger physical instantons are not yet strongly affected . </S>",
    "<S> eventually , the instantons will also start to be erased , leading again to an increase in @xmath96 .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we think that the plateau region is the correct regime for extracting physical information about instantons . </S>",
    "<S> the _ equivalent _ data sets of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite are precisely located around the plateau .    </S>",
    "<S> our scaling variable @xmath88 allows to combine lattice data for a whole range of lattice spacings @xmath105 and cools @xmath77 , which strongly helps to increase the separation power between the @xmath105-dependent artifacts and the instantons of a certain _ physical _ size . in future analyses </S>",
    "<S> , it may be worthwhile to determine the unknown constant in the definition  ( [ rcool ] ) of @xmath88 , e.g. by means of calibration via cooling an isolated instanton until it disappears .    </S>",
    "<S> * 4 . * </S>",
    "<S> we are now ready to discuss the continuum limit of the ukqcd data for the size distribution of @xmath8 s and @xmath106 s , @xmath107 , and to compare it with the dilute - gas prediction @xmath108 of @xmath8-perturbation theory , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dens ] ) , for @xmath29 .    </S>",
    "<S> we note , first of all , that the ( small ) residual @xmath105 dependence of the _ equivalent _ data for the size distribution in physical units may be parametrized as @xmath109 the continuum limit of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ shapedist ] ) can thus be performed quite reliably , by simply rescaling the arguments @xmath110 . here </S>",

    "<S> as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , @xmath113 was extrapolated linearly in @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting continuum size distribution obtained by the above rescaling from the three equivalent data sets is displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ lattice ] . </S>",
    "<S> it scales nicely .    </S>",
    "<S> [ ht ]    we are now ready to perform a quantitative comparison with @xmath8-perturbation theory . the corresponding prediction ( [ dens ] ) is a power law for small @xmath38 , i.e. approximately @xmath115 for @xmath29 . due to its 2-loop rg - invariance </S>",
    "<S> the normalization of @xmath116 is practically independent of the renormalization scale @xmath24 over a wide range . </S>",
    "<S> it is strongly dependent on @xmath117 , for which we take the most recent , accurate lattice result by the alpha collaboration  @xcite , @xmath118 mevfm . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ lattice ]  ( a ) we display both this parameter - free prediction ( [ dens ] ) of @xmath8-perturbation theory and the continuum limit of the ukqcd data in a log - log plot , to clearly exhibit the expected power law in @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement in shape fm has been noted by us already previously  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here , we have extended the analysis to the continuum limit and , in particular , verified the agreement in normalization . ] _ and _ normalization for @xmath119 is striking , indeed , notably in view of the often criticized cooling procedure and the strong sensitivity to @xmath120 . </S>",
    "<S> one may argue that a choice @xmath121 is theoretically favoured , since it tends to suppress @xmath122 corrections . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , as apparent from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ lattice ]  ( b ) , the agreement extends in this case up to the peak around @xmath123 .    at this point , </S>",
    "<S> an interesting way to proceed is to define a non - perturbative `` instanton - scheme '' for @xmath11 by the requirement that the theoretical expression ( [ dens ] ) for the size distribution @xmath116 _ precisely _ reproduces the corresponding lattice data , @xmath124 by comparing in the perturbative regime with the @xmath125 form ( [ dens ] ) for @xmath126 , we arrive at a standard scheme conversion formula , @xmath127 with @xmath128 next , we note that as a function of @xmath129 , @xmath116 has a peak structure like the lattice data , with maximum at @xmath130 the scale factor @xmath131 of the @xmath8-scheme is non - perturbatively and uniquely determined by the peak value of the lattice data for the size distribution . using the very good gaussian fit to all data in fig .

    "<S> it is remarkable that in the non - perturbative long - distance regime , @xmath139 , @xmath140 from the @xmath141 size distribution tends to approach @xmath142 defined via the static @xmath143 potential , @xmath144 , @xmath145 with string tension @xmath146 . </S>",
