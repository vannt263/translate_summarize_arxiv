    "the spatio - temporal extension and evolution of the interaction region in heavy - ion collisions are not directly observable .",

    "however , the interpretation of the measured hbt correlations is in general model dependent , and the question arises to what extent their interpretational ambiguity can be reduced by a refined analysis of the data .",
    "in general , hbt radius parameters measure the gaussian widths ( second central moments ) of the source distribution in space - time @xcite .",
    "it is the finite lifetime of the particle source in heavy ion collisions which complicates their interpretation . for a static boson emitting source ,",
    "the hbt - radii have a _ unique _ interpretation in terms of geometrical source sizes . for dynamical sources like those created in heavy ion collisions , however ,",
    "the hbt - radii measure certain linear combinations of the lifetime , the geometrical sizes and other space - time correlations @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "if the source expands all hbt parameters become functions of the pair momentum @xcite .    for",
    "azimuthally symmetric sources , corresponding to heavy - ion collisions at zero impact parameter , there exist two different `` complete '' gaussian parametrizations for the correlation function : the cartesian parametrization with parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite , and the yano - koonin - podgoretski  ( ykp ) parametrisation with parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7  @xcite . in each case , for expanding sources , these parameters are functions of the pair momentum .",
    "the @xmath8-parameters have the dimension of a length while @xmath7 is a velocity .",
    "the cartesian parametrization has the additional difficulty that the value and the spatio - temporal interpretation of its parameters depend strongly on the longitudinal rest frame of the observer .",
    "the ykp radius parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , on the other hand , are independent of the longitudinal velocity of the frame in which the particle momenta are measured .",
    "the fourth ykp fit parameter , the yano - koonin velocity @xmath7 , singles out a specific longitudinal rest frame ( relative to the observer ) in which the spatio - temporal interpretation of the ( longitudinally boost - invariant ) ykp - radius parameters becomes particularly simple .",
    "in fact , for `` transparent '' sources ( i.e.  sources , for which particle emission occurs from the whole volume and is not surface dominated ) without collective transverse expansion , it was shown in @xcite that @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 give exactly the transverse , longitudinal and temporal widths respectively , of the source emission function in the yano - koonin frame where @xmath9 .",
    "we will show here that in this case , up to small corrections from asymmetries of the source rapidity profile due to longitudinal expansion flow , @xmath7 coincides with the longitudinal velocity of the fluid element around the point of highest emissivity in the source , such that @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 measure ( and cleanly separate ) the transverse , longitudinal and temporal lengths of homogeneity of the source in the rest frame of the emitter . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec4a ] , the pair momentum dependence of @xmath7 allows to measure the longitudinal expansion of the source in a very direct way .    for the class of models studied here",
    ", we will also show ( see sec .",
    "[ sec4d ] ) that in the absence of transverse collective expansion the ykp parameters show perfect @xmath10-scaling , i.e. , they are , for a given source , universal functions of the transverse mass @xmath11 of the particle pair , independent of the particle rest mass .",
    "this can be tested by comparing @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 correlations .",
    "the same is not true for the cartesian parameters which contain additional kinematic and frame dependent factors which distinguish between pairs of particles with different mass .",
    "this type of @xmath15 scaling of the ykp parameters is violated for sources with transverse collective expansion ; also other types of transverse @xmath16-@xmath17-correlations , like e.g. those occurring in opaque sources @xcite , and final state effects like resonance decays after freeze - out @xcite , can break this scaling . for a detailed discussion of these effects",

    "@xcite ( opaque sources ) and @xcite ( resonance decays ) .    one of the purposes of this paper is to investigate the specific effects on the correlator and the related corrections to the spatio - temporal interpretation of the ykp parameters introduced by transverse expansion flow in the source .",
    "these will in general depend on the particular source model , and such an investigation thus must necessarily involve an extensive model study .",
    "we investigate here numerically a simple parametrization of the source which implements the finite longitudinal , transverse and temporal extension and the longitudinal expansion of realistic heavy - ion generated sources and contains the transverse expansion flow as a tunable parameter .",
    "we will see that strong transverse flow affects the interpretation of the ykp parameter @xmath6 as the lifetime of the source ( in its own rest frame ) and thus renders the extraction of the duration of particle emission from the correlation data more difficult and less quantitatively reliable .",
    "on the other hand , it also spoils the @xmath10-scaling of the ykp radius parameters which opens the possibility for an independent estimate of the transverse flow velocity from comparison between pion and kaon correlations .",
    "clearly , such an estimate will remain somewhat model - dependent , but the mechanisms isolated in the present paper should still be very useful for qualitative consistency checks between data and theoretical interpretation .",
    "the investigation reported here has two aspects : an analytical and a numerical one . on the analytical level ,",
    "we study the connection between the ykp parameters and the second space - time moments of the emission function , discussing the dependence of the latter on various geometric and dynamical features of particle emission .",
    "this discussion is largely model - independent ; it is much more detailed than the short account given in @xcite and should thus serve as a general basis of understanding which can be used to qualitatively anticipate the behaviour of the ykp parameters also for other source models than the one studied here .",

    "we give a detailed discussion of the reference frame specified by @xmath7 and establish its relation to several other commonly used reference frames .",
    "their definitions are :    * * cms * : the centre of mass frame of the fireball , specified by @xmath149 . * * lcms * ( longitudinally comoving system @xcite ) : a pion ( kaon ) pair - dependent frame , specified by @xmath150 . in this frame",
    ", only the transverse velocity component of the pion ( kaon ) pair is non - vanishing . * * lsps * ( longitudinal saddle - point system @xcite ) : the longitudinally moving rest frame of the point of maximal emissivity for a given pair momentum . in general",
    ", the velocity of this frame depends on the momentum of the emitted particle pair . for symmetric sources the point of maximal emissivity ( `` saddle point '' ) coincides with the `` source centre '' @xmath34 defined in ( [ 1.4 ] ) . in this approximation , for a source like ( [ 2.1 ] ) , the lsps velocity is given by the longitudinal component of @xmath151 .",
    "* * yk * ( yano - koonin frame @xcite ) : the frame for which the ykp velocity parameter vanishes , @xmath152 .",
    "again , this frame is in general pair momentum dependent .",
    "these four frames are quite different in nature . the velocities ( or rapidities ) of the cms and lcms frames can be easily determined experimentally , the first from the peak in the single particle rapidity distribution , the second from the longitudinal momentum of the measured pion pair . however , the velocity of the lsps is in a sense more interesting : from its definition it is directly related to the longitudinal expansion velocity of the source .",
    "in fact , longitudinal expansion of the source leads to a characteristic dependence of the lsps velocity @xmath153 on the pair rapidity .",
    "this is most easily seen by considering two extreme fireball models :    \\(1 ) if the source does not expand , all its elements move with the same velocity ( rapidity ) , namely that of the cms . then there is no kinematic difference between different parts of the fireball , and the saddle point is @xmath65-independent and given by the peak of the space - time distribution of the source .",
    "thus the rapidity of the lsps , defined as @xmath154 $ ] , is _ independent _ of the pair rapidity @xmath155 and identical to the rapidity of the cms .",
    "this behaviour of @xmath156 arises automatically if the source has no @xmath157 correlations , i.e. if the emission function factorizes , @xmath158",
    ". then all space - time characteristics of the source , including the lsps velocity , are determined by @xmath159 alone and do not depend on @xmath65 .",
    "hence @xmath156 is independent of @xmath155 .",
    "factorization is , however , not necessary for this behaviour : non - vanishing @xmath160 correlations generated , e.g. , by temperature gradients do nt induce a @xmath155-dependence of @xmath156 as long as the source does not expand longitudinally .",
    "\\(2 ) if we set in eq .  ( [ 2.1 ] ) @xmath161 , we recover the bjorken model @xcite for a longitudinally infinite source with boost - invariant longitudinal expansion .",
    "the only @xmath162-dependence then comes from the thermal boltzmann factor , and the longitudinal saddle point obviously lies at @xmath163 .",
    "since for the bjorken scaling profile @xmath162 coincides with the longitudinal fluid rapidity , this implies that in this case the rapidity of the lsps is _ identical _ with the pair rapidity , @xmath164 , i.e. the lsps coincides with the lcms .",
    "it is obvious from this discussion that knowledge of the function @xmath165 would allow to distinguish between these two scenarios : a non - expanding source would yield @xmath166 while a source with boost - invariant longitudinal expansion gives @xmath167 .",
    "realistic models are expected to lie in between these two extremes .",
    "unfortunately , the lsps - velocity @xmath168 can not be measured .",
    "this is clear from its definition as the longitudinal flow velocity evaluated at the point of maximum emissivity .",
    "as discussed above , this point is approximately given by the source centre @xmath34 which itself is unmeasurable : it drops out @xcite from both the single and two - particle spectra which are invariant under a translation of the source centre ( even if @xmath35-dependent ! ) .",
    "the only velocity we can measure , namely from an ykp fit of the two - particle correlator , is the yano - koonin ( yk ) velocity @xmath104 resp .",
    "the associated rapidity @xmath169 $ ] .",
    "it is therefore very gratifying to know that for sufficiently rapidly expanding systems the two velocities are always closely related ( although in general not identical ) . in particular",
    ", we will show below that for the class of models ( [ 2.1 ] ) the function @xmath170 shares with @xmath165 the feature that it provides a direct signature for longitudinal expansion .",
    "the close relationship between the ( measurable ) yk - velocity and the ( theoretical ) lsps - velocity for certain source models has been known for years . in ref .",
    "@xcite a `` symmetric frame '' was introduced as the reference frame , in which the production process is symmetric in the beam direction . in this frame , the longitudinal extension and the lifetime of the source reach their extremal values  @xcite . for moving , but non - expanding azimuthally symmetric sources podgoretski  found in this way the parametrisation ( [ 1.11 ] ) , with @xmath35-independent parameters @xmath103 , @xmath102 , and @xmath6 , and with what we call the yano - koonin velocity @xmath7 being identical to the velocity of his `` symmetric frame '' . in this case",
    "the yk - system also coincides with the rest frame of the source as a whole ( cms ) as well as with the lsps .    that the coincidence between the yk and lsps systems is more generally valid for sources which are symmetric around their saddle point",
    "@xmath34 has been observed in refs .",
    "it thus holds for any emission function in the gaussian saddle - point approximation , due to the symmetry of the latter .",
    "as the following paragraph will show , differences between the yk - velocity and the velocity of the lsps are only due to asymmetries of the source around its saddle point .",

    "detailed dynamical studies of the freeze - out process have shown that the transverse gradients of the temperature across the freeze - out surface tend to be small @xcite .",
    "so the experimentally observed @xmath15-dependence of the transverse radius @xcite is presumably due to transverse flow @xcite .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the strength of the @xmath15-dependence of @xmath103 increases monotonously with the strength @xmath127 of the transverse expansion .",
    "alber @xcite has suggested to quantify the strength of collective flow by fitting the hbt radii to a power law in @xmath15 , @xmath256 and using the magnitude of the extracted ( negative ) power as a flow measure .",
    "he found @xmath257 for @xmath2 and smaller values for @xmath258 , with a tendency to increase for larger collision systems @xcite .",
    "he interpreted this as a signature for strong longitudinal and weaker transverse expansion , the latter becoming more important for larger systems .    in fig .",
    "[ f11 ] we study the possible conclusions from such an exercise when applied to the results from our model .",
    "the left column shows double logarithmic plots for @xmath103 and @xmath102 as functions of @xmath15 .",
    "obviously the assumption of a power law dependence is well justified for @xmath102 but somewhat marginal for @xmath103 .",
    "@xmath259 can not be approximated by a power law at all . in the right column",
    "we show the extracted powers as a function of @xmath127 , the scale parameter for the transverse flow .",
    "since @xmath103 is not well represented by a power law , the extracted slope depends somewhat on the fit region , as indicated for the two sets of curves in fig .",
    "altogether it is , however , clear that for pions the power @xmath258 increases approximately linearly with @xmath127 and for kaons somewhat more strongly .",
    "but even for large transverse flow rapidities @xmath260 the power remains below 0.2 .",
    "in contrast , the corresponding power @xmath261 in a fit @xmath262 is already 0.55 in the absence of transverse flow , reflecting the strong boost - invariant longitudinal expansion .",
    "( note that the decrease of @xmath102 with increasing @xmath15 is faster than the @xmath263-law suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite  see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of this point . ) as the transverse flow is switched on , @xmath261 changes much more weakly than @xmath258 , showing that @xmath102 is mostly sensitive to the longitudinal flow while @xmath103 is only affected by transverse expansion .",
    "again , kaons are affected by the transverse flow more strongly than pions .",
    "we have presented a numerical study of the yano - koonin - podgoretski   fit parameters for the two - particle correlation function .",
    "our starting point were the recently derived model - independent expressions for the ykp parameters in terms of second order space - time variances of the source emission function .",
    "these expressions allow for an easy evaluation of the ykp parameters as functions of the pair momentum @xmath35 and for detailed parameter studies .",
    "we exploited them for a class of hydrodynamic models describing locally thermalized and collectively expanding sources , and we studied the dependence of the ykp parameters on the longitudinal and temporal extension of the source as well as on its longitudinal and transverse expansion velocity .    in the context of such models it has been argued previously that in a certain approximation ( which becomes exact in the absence of transverse @xmath16-@xmath17-correlations of the source as , e.g. , induced by transverse expansion flow ) the ykp parametrisation achieves a perfect factorisation of the longitudinal and transverse spatial and the temporal extensions ( `` lengths of homogeneity '' ) of the source , in the comoving frame of the emitting fluid element .",
    "the velocity of this emitting fluid element is then given by the fourth ykp parameter ( the yk velocity ) .",
    "here we have shown numerically that , within these models , these features are preserved even in the presence of transverse flow .",
    "the transverse radius parameter @xmath264 gives the effective transverse size of the source , the longitudinal radius parameter @xmath265 its effective longitudinal size , both in the local rest frame of the emitter as seen by pairs with momentum @xmath35 .",
    "also , the ykp parameter @xmath266 provides a direct estimate of the effective emission duration for particles with momentum @xmath35 ; this estimate is quite accurate as long as the average transverse flow rapidity remains below 0.5 and the `` lifetime parameter '' @xmath228 is not too small ( @xmath267 fm/@xmath97 ) .",
    "we also showed analytically and numerically that the yk velocity obtained from the ykp fit is indeed approximately equal to the longitudinal velocity of the emitting fluid element ( the lsps velocity ) , and that the small differences between these two velocities can be understood quantitatively in terms of asymmetries of the source around the point of maximum emissivity ( its `` saddle point '' ) .",
    "this enables us to interpret the rise of the yk rapidity with the pair rapidity @xmath155 as a direct consequence of the longitudinal expansion of our source , and the @xmath15-dependence of the slope of the function @xmath170 as a signature for the thermal smearing of the particle momenta in the fluid rest frame . in ref .",
    "@xcite we further showed that the slope of the function @xmath170 is nearly independent of the transverse flow rapidity @xmath127 .",
    "thus the yk rapidity is manifestly dominated by the _ longitudinal _ expansion and hardly affected by the transverse expansion at all .",
    "the latter causes , on the other hand , an @xmath15-dependence of the transverse radius parameter @xmath103 , which in turn is completely unaffected by the longitudinal expansion . in the present model study , the ykp parametrisation thus not only leads to a factorisation of the ( transverse and longitudinal ) spatial and temporal aspects of the source _ geometry _ , but it also cleanly separates its transverse and longitudinal _",
    "dynamics_.    the sensitivity of the ykp radius parameters to the transverse expansion of the source was investigated quantitatively in sec .",
    "[ sec4d ] .",
    "while the longitudinal radius parameter @xmath102 is affected very little by the transverse flow ( its strong @xmath15-dependence arises from the strong longitudinal flow ) , the transverse radius shows a considerable dependence on @xmath127 ( but none to the longitudinal flow ) .",
    "furthermore , transverse flow breaks the exact @xmath15-scaling of the ykp radius parameters which we showed to exist for @xmath131 ( see also @xcite ) . as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec4d ] , both effects can be combined for a quantitative extraction of the mean transverse expansion velocity from the ykp radius parameters .",
    "the results from a comprehensive analysis @xcite of resonance decay contributions to the correlation function indicate that they do nt jeopardise such a program .",
    "we would not like to close without remarking that the class of source models studied here is restricted in one crucial aspect : if the source is `` opaque '' @xcite , ( i.e.  the particle emission is strongly surface dominated rather than being distributed over the whole emission region with a gaussian geometric weight as assumed here ) , the resulting differences between the variances @xmath91 and @xmath92 lead to much larger contributions in eqs .",
    "( [ 1.17 ] ) , ( [ 1.19 ] ) and ( [ 3.1 ] ) than found in the present study . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that this affects strongly the interpretation of measured ykp parameters , in particular of the `` temporal '' parameter @xmath75 , which typically becomes strongly negative for small @xmath130 due to the negative contribution from @xmath268 in this case . however , that study also shows that presently available data on ykp radii from pb+pb collisions @xcite do not show any such indications for opaqueness of the source and favor models with volume dominated emission .",
    "the na44 data @xcite for hbt radii from heavy ion collisions with pb targets at the cern sps , which within the standard cartesian parametrization seem to be consistent with @xmath269 , are more difficult to interpret because of the non - trivial shape of the acceptance window of this experiment in the @xmath270 plane and the lack of information on the @xmath65-dependence of these parameters .",
    "also , the important consistency relations ( [ 1.15 ] ) so far have only been checked by the na49 collaboration @xcite whose data are in qualitative agreement with the numerical results presented here @xcite . a quantitative comparison with the experiments will be presented as soon as finalized data become available .",
