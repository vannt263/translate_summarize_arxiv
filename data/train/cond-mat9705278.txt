    "walks @xcite , a description in terms of power of field operators seems to be ruled out by stability considerations @xcite . here we show that already a simple product of two power - of - field operators complies with both somewhat contrary requirements .",
    "we start from the theory of polymer stars , star - like arrangements of polymer chains with self and mutual excluded interaction @xcite .",
    "we generalize this concept to stars of chains of different polymer species which may differ in their self and mutual interactions .",
    "our formalism describes homogeneous polymer stars , stars of mutually avoiding walks ( maw ) , and the situation of two mutually interacting stars .",
    "polymers and polymer solutions are among the most intensively studied objects in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "the behavior of multi - component solutions containing polymers of different species is especially rich .",
    "systems of chemically linked polymer chains of different species like block copolymers are also of considerable experimental and technical interest . linking polymer chains of different or even contrary properties , like hydrophile and hydrophobe chains ,",
    "one receives systems with qualitatively new behavior . here , we concentrate on systems of chains in a solvent which , in a given temperature range , differ in their respective steric interaction properties .",
    "we generalize the theory of multi - component polymer solutions @xcite to solutions of copolymer networks , i.e. chains of different species linked at their endpoints in the form of stars or networks of any topology ( see figs.[fig1 ] - [ fig3 ] ) .    for solutions of polymer networks of a single species the scaling properties",
    "have been extensively studied by renormalization group methods ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "star polymers as the most simple polymer networks may be produced by linking together the endpoints of polymer chains at some core molecule ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .    in the same way networks of any given topology",
    "may be generated ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "randomly linked polymer networks are also obtained as a result of a vulcanization process by randomly linking nearby monomers of different chains to each other .",
    "the asymptotic properties of homogeneous systems of linear chain molecules in solution are universal in the limit of long chains .",
    "let us give a short account of the standard textbook results @xcite",
    ". for each system one finds a so called @xmath1 temperature at which the two point attractive and repulsive interactions between the different monomers compensate each other . as a result",
    "the polymer chains may be described by random walks ( up to higher order corrections ) : the mean square distance between the chains endpoints @xmath2 scales with the number of monomers @xmath3 like @xmath4 . above the @xmath5 temperature",
    "the effective interaction between the monomers is repulsive resulting in a swelling of the polymer coil which is universal for @xmath6 : @xmath7 where the correlation length exponent @xmath8 in space dimension @xmath9 .",
    "the number of configurations @xmath10 of a polymer chain of @xmath3 monomers grows for @xmath11 like @xmath12 with a non - universal fugacity @xmath13 and a universal exponent @xmath14 for @xmath9 . in the early 70-ies following the work of de gennes @xcite the scaling theory of polymers",
    "was elaborated in detail using the analogy between the asymptotic properties of long polymer chains and the long distance correlations of a magnetic system in the vicinity of the 2nd order phase transition ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this mapping allows one to receive the above defined exponents @xmath15 and @xmath16 as limits of the correlation length exponent @xmath15 and the magnetic susceptibility critical exponent @xmath16 of the @xmath17 - symmetric @xmath18-vector model in the formal limit @xmath19 @xcite",
    ".    on the other hand , if polymers of different species are present in the same solution the scaling behavior of the observables may be much more rich .",
    "let us consider a solution of two different species of polymers in some solvent , a so called ternary solution . depending on the temperature the system may then behave as if one or more of the inter- and intra- chain interactions vanish in the sense described above @xcite .",
    "this will lead to asymptotic scaling laws that may differ from those observed for each species alone @xcite .",
    "interesting new systems are obtained when linking together polymers of different species .",
    "the most simple system of this kind is a so called block copolymer consisting of two parts of different species .",
    "they are of some technical importance e.g. serving as surfactants @xcite . for our study",
    "they give the most simple example of a polymer star consisting of chains of two different species ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) which we will call here a copolymer star . for the homogeneous polymer star the asymptotic properties",
    "are uniquely determined by the number of its constituting chains and the dimension of space . for the number of configurations ( partition function ) @xmath20 of a polymer star of @xmath21 chains",
    "each consisting of @xmath3 monomers one finds @xcite : @xmath22 the second part shows scaling with the size @xmath23 of the isolated coil of @xmath3 monomers on some scale @xmath24 , omitting the fugacity factor .",

    "have no physical counterparts in the set of exponents describing magnetic phase transitions .",
    "nevertheless they can be related to the scaling dimensions of composite operators of traceless symmetry in the polymer limit @xmath19 of the @xmath17 symmetric @xmath18-vector model @xcite .",
    "the exponents @xmath28 have been calculated analytically in perturbation theory @xcite , by exact methods in two dimensions @xcite , and by monte carlo simulations @xcite .    it has been shown that the scaling properties of polymer networks of arbitrary but fixed topology are uniquely defined by its constituting stars @xcite , as long as the statistical ensemble respects some conditions on the chain length distribution @xcite .",
    "thus the knowledge of the set of star exponents @xmath28 or @xmath29 allows to obtain the power laws corresponding to ( [ 1.3 ] ) also for any polymer network of arbitrary topology .",
    "the partition function @xmath30 of a polymer network @xmath31 ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) of @xmath32 chains each of @xmath3 monomers scales with @xmath6 according to @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 the number of vertices with @xmath21 legs and @xmath35 is the number of loops in the network @xmath31 .    in this article",
    "we address a somewhat more complex problem : what happens to the scaling laws if we build a polymer star or general network of chains of different species ?",
    "in view of the above introduced ternary solutions , we thus study systems of polymer networks in which some of the intra and inter chain interactions may vanish .",
    "for instance , there may be _ only mutual _ excluded volume interactions between chains of the two different species in the copolymer star shown in [ fig3 ] while chains of the same species may freely intersect .",
    "each subset of chains of one species thus constitutes a star of random walks avoiding the second star of random walks .",
    "cates and witten @xcite have shown that this problem of a star of random walks avoiding a given fractal structure is the key to calculating the the multifractal spectrum of absorption of diffusing particles on this fractal .",
    "this calculation can be performed explicitly for the diffusion near absorbing polymers @xcite .",
    "the setup of our article is as follows . in section [ ii ]",
    "we introduce notation and relate the polymer model to a lagrangian field theory .",
    "this field theoretical formalism will be used throughout the paper . in section [ iii ]",
    "we define the renormalization group procedures .",
    "we present two alternative approaches : zero mass renormalization together with @xmath36- expansion ( see e.g.@xcite ) and massive renormalization at fixed dimension @xcite .",
    "section [ iv ] is devoted to the study of the renormalization group flow of the ternary model and its fixed points .",
    "series for critical exponents governing the scaling behavior of copolymer stars and stars of mutually avoiding walks are obtained in section [ v ] . in section [ vi ]",
    "we discuss the problem of resummation of the asymptotic series arising in this context .",
    "numerical results are presented in section [ vii ] .",
    "we close with concluding remarks and an outlook on possible applications of the theory in section [ viii ] and give some calculational details in appendices .",

    "let us first take a look at the model we use to describe polymers . in a first discrete version",
    "we describe a configuration of the polymer by a set of positions of segment endpoints : @xmath37 its statistical weight ( boltzmann factor ) with the hamiltonian @xmath38 divided by the product of boltzmann constant @xmath39 and temperature @xmath40 will be given by @xmath41 = \\exp\\{-\\frac{1}{4\\ell_0 ^ 2}\\sum_{j=1}^{n}(r_j - r_{j-1})^2    - \\beta\\ell_{0}^d \\sum_{i\\neq j=1}^n \\delta^d(r_i - r_j ) \\}.\\ ] ] the first term describes the chain connectivity , the parameter @xmath42 governs the mean sqare segment length .",
    "the second term describes the excluded volume interaction forbidding two segment end points to take the same position in space .",
    "the parameter @xmath43 gives the strength of this interaction .",
    "the third parameter in our model is the chain length or number of segments @xmath3 .",
    "the partition function @xmath10 is calculated as an integral over all configurations of the polymer divided by the system volume @xmath44 , thus dividing out identical configurations just translated in space : @xmath45 .\\ ] ] this will give us the ` number of configurations ' of the polymer ( [ 1.2 ] ) .",
    "we will do our investigations by mapping the polymer model to a renormalizable field theory making use of well developed formalisms ( see @xcite for example ) . to this end",
    "we introduce a continuous version of our model as proposed by edwards @xcite generalizing it to describe a set of @xmath21 polymer chains of varying composition possibly tied together at their end points .",
    "the configuration of one polymer is now given by a path @xmath46 in @xmath47 - dimensional space @xmath48 parametrized by a surface variable @xmath49 .",
    "we now allow for a symmetric matrix of excluded volume interactions @xmath50 between chains @xmath51 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath38 is then given by @xmath52 with densities @xmath53 .",
    "in this formalism the partition function is calculated as a functional integral : @xmath54 \\exp\\{- \\frac{1}{k_{\\rm b}t } { \\cal h}(r^a)\\ } .\\ ] ] here the symbol @xmath55 $ ] includes normalization such that @xmath56 for all @xmath57 . to make the exponential of @xmath58-functions in ( [ 2.4 ] ) and the functional integral well - defined in the bare theory a cutoff @xmath59 is introduced such that all simultaneous integrals of any variables @xmath60 and @xmath61 on the same chain are cut off by @xmath62 .",

    "the one particle irreducible vertex functions @xmath79 of this theory are defined by : @xmath80 the average @xmath81 in ( [ 2.9 ] ) is understood with respect to the lagrangian ( [ 2.7 ] ) keeping only those contributions which correspond to one - particle irreducible graphs and which have non - vanishing tensor factors in the limit @xmath78 .",

    "the vertex function @xmath87 is thus defined by insertion of the composite operator @xmath88 .",
    "its scaling properties are governed by the scaling dimension of this operator .",
    "when only one species is present one can also define @xmath89 by insertion of a composite operator of traceless symmetry @xcite .",

    "the composite operator in ( [ 2.11 ] ) reduces to the product of two power - of - field operators with appropriate symmetry @xmath93 each corresponding to a product of fields of the same ` species '",
    ". nevertheless , our results are easily generalized to the case of any number of polymer species .    the starting point for our calculations",
    "are the three loop expansions for the bare vertex functions of interest @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath87 .",
    "they involve the loop integrals @xmath96 .",

    "this is achieved by a controlled rearrangement of the series for the vertex functions .",
    "several asymptotically equivalent procedures serve to this purpose . here",

    "@xmath131 @xcite .",
    "it also gives quantitative results for the preasymptotic critical behavior @xcite .",
    "most authors tend to prefer one method and to exclude the other for non obvious reasons . the application of both approaches will enable us in particular to check the consistency of approximations and the accuracy of the results obtained .",
    "let us formulate the relations for a renormalized theory in terms of the corresponding renormalization conditions .",
    "though they are different in principle for the two procedures , we may formulate them simultaneously using the same expressions .",
    "note that the polymer limit of zero component fields leads to essential simplification .",

    "these are given by @xmath147 the renormalized couplings @xmath136 defined by the relations ( [ 3.1]),([3.2 ] ) depend on the scale parameter @xmath138 . by their dependence on @xmath136 also",
    "the renormalization @xmath148 - factors implicitly depend on @xmath138 .",
    "this dependence is expressed by the rg functions defined by the following relations : @xmath149 the function @xmath150 describes the pair correlation critical exponent , while the functions @xmath151 and @xmath152 define the set of exponents for copolymer stars and stars of mutually avoiding walks .",
    "note that @xmath153 renormalizes the vertex function with a @xmath123 insertion which coincides with @xmath121 .",

    "let us note here that the conventional resummation of the @xmath43- functions in the massive approach leads to a severe inconsistency which is the reason for us to take the pseudo-@xmath36 or @xmath187-expansion method .",
    "the distinct feature of the @xmath251-functions introduced here is that they are functions of different numbers of variables which leads to ambiguities in their analytical continuation via pad approximants or rational approximants of several variables ( see @xcite ) .",

    "the corresponding expressions read : @xmath252 with obvious expressions for @xmath253 . in order to obtain the analytical continuation of the borel transformed functions of one variable @xmath254 ( [ 6.7 ] )",

    "due to different analytical continuations for the borel transforms of the series ( [ 6.7 ] ) on one hand and of ( [ 6.8 ] ) on the other , solving the fixed - point equation for the resummed function @xmath264 we will never obtain a symmetrical solution @xmath265 .",

    "it is convincing that the two approaches and the different resummation procedures all lead to results which lie within a bandwidth of consistency , which is broadening for larger values of number of chains @xmath273 .",
    "this is not surprising as we have seen in section [ v ] that our expansion parameters are multiplied by @xmath101 and @xmath103 .",
    "rather it is remarkable that even for a total number of chains of the order of 10 ( see tables [ tab5 ] , [ tab6 ] ) we still receive results which are comparable to each other .",
    "it seems noteworthy that at least for low numbers of chains ( @xmath274 ) the non resummed @xmath187-expansion seems to give results which do not differ essentially from the resummed values .",
    "also the non refined pad - borel results of the @xmath187-expansion are closer to the refined summation of the @xmath36-expansion .",
    "does the data answer the question of convexity of the spectrum ?",
    "a close study of the matrix of values reveals , that for fixed @xmath101 both @xmath275 and @xmath276 are convex from above as function of @xmath103 , thus yielding ` mf statistics ' .",
