    "similar relation can be written in case of lithium produced in spallation processes .",

    "since larger mw type galaxies are the main source of star formation on lower redshifts , we can still approximate @xmath52 . in case of the mw",
    "we will use the same momentum power law source spectrum @xmath39 ( consistent with  @xcite for local gcr spectrum ) , but the propagation is done based on  leaky box  model just as in  @xcite , which allows the escape of the most energetic particles and leads to the change of spectral index on high energies ( where we get @xmath89 ) .",
    "abundances of c , n , o that we need in order to include spallation processes can be found in  @xcite ( we again assume that these abundances were constant throughout mw history and equal to the half of the present day value ) .",
    "the resulting differential gamma - ray intensity of mw - like galaxies is also plotted on fig .",
    "1 ( dashed line ) .",
    "it is in good agreement with the  @xcite results for the total gcr - produced gamma - ray spectrum of all unresolved star forming galaxies ( they have also assumed that mw is a typical star forming galaxy ) .",
    "we calculate the possible @xmath0 production by gcrs in the mw , and get that mw could produce around @xmath90 orders of magnitude more lithium than smc .",
    "compared to the solar abundance of lithium @xmath91  @xcite we get @xmath92 .",
    "this also means that if we assume that the entire solar @xmath0 abundance is produced by gcrs , the corresponding gamma - ray intensity of the mw - like galaxies would be larger and would violate the observed igrb , which is consistent with the conclusions in  @xcite .",
    "the difference in resulting lithium production when using smc and mw for normalization comes from a larger csfr in case of larger mw galaxy . also , the present star formation rate of the mw @xmath84  @xcite is around @xmath93 times larger than in the smc",
    "@xmath61  @xcite .",
    "our galaxy also has over an order of magnitude larger gas mass compared to the smc , which results in larger cosmic - ray lithium production and the resulting gamma - ray flux .",
    "there is also a difference in the slope of the cr spectra for these two galaxies , which will impact the mean production cross sections for lithium and gamma - rays .",
    "moreover , in  @xcite gamma - ray emissivity of the smc is compared to that of the mw and they argue that the local mw value is at least @xmath94 times higher then that of the smc , while  @xcite use an even higher value for the mw gamma - ray emissivity . also , in  @xcite it is shown that the observed gamma - ray flux in the smc implies that the average cr density in this galaxy is at most around @xmath95 of the measured mw value .",
    "all of this will result in a smaller lithium production in the smc compared to our galaxy .",
    "using the _ fermi_-lat gamma - ray detection of the smc we have estimated the amount of lithium that can be produced by gcrs which we assume to be the cosmic - ray population producing observed gamma - ray flux . even though , gcrs are expected to be the dominant cr population , our calculation shows that gcr - produced @xmath0 is less then @xmath96 of the observed abundance .",
    "we have included @xmath32 interactions , as well as spallation processes . in case of smcs metallicity and cr spectrum ,",
    "spallation is a subdominant production channel and most of the cr produced lithium in case of this galaxy is produced via fusion processes .    as the most extreme assumption",
    ", we can say that the _ fermi_-lat diffuse gamma - ray background  @xcite is entirely produced by gamma rays from unresolved smc - like galaxies . if we go through the same procedure as before , with this extreme assumption , we can explain @xmath97 of the observed @xmath0 abundance .",
    "on the other hand this extreme assumption can produce only @xmath98 of the observed @xmath5 abundance ( and @xmath99 without this extreme assumption ) , which is consistent with the fact that this lithium isotope , is in big part produced in the bbn .",
    "observed abundance of this isotope in the smc is consistent with the expected primordial abundance , so after removing gcr - produced @xmath5 that we get , we still wo nt deviate much from the expected primordial abundance .",
    "also , in  @xcite it was found that the observed lithium isotopic ratio of @xmath100 implies that crs in general could have produced @xmath101 of the observed @xmath5 abundance in the smc .",
    "all of this , leaves room for some additional cr component next to the gcrs .",
    "we can also use the observed lithium abundances in the smc and predict how much can smc - like galaxies contribute to the observed igrb if the entire observed lithium in smc was produce solely by gcrs .",
    "if this was the case , the resulting gamma - ray production would be @xmath102 times larger than the observed igrb in case of the propagated cr spectrum ( if we include both fusion and spallation processes ) .",
    "this would also mean that the present day gamma - ray flux of the smc should be @xmath90 orders of magnitude larger than the observed value .",
    "on the other hand , if an important part of the observed smc lithium is made by some other process , other than gcr interactions , it would be possible to produce the observed lithium abundances without producing that many gamma - rays .",
    "the isotopic ratio of lithium measured in the smc is consistent with the ratio measured in the mw gas  @xcite .",
    "since smc is a lower metallicity system and with a lower cr fluence than in the mw , if gcrs are the dominant cr species one would expect the isotopic ratio @xmath103 to be lower than in the mw . observed abundance of @xmath0 , which is larger than the one derived from our models , and the observed isotopic ratio work in favor of some other cosmic - ray acceleration mechanism being present in the smc , which could in turn produce more lithium .",
    "for example cosmic rays could be produced by large scale structure formation  @xcite , high - energy pulsars  @xcite , pulsar wind nebulae  @xcite or binary systems  @xcite .",
    "if any of these mechanisms is an important contributor to lithium production and accelerates crs for a long time , it would also enhance the gamma - ray flux of these galaxies .",
    "the observed igrb can constrain any of these mechanism , but since we are dealing with small galaxies ( and our gcr produced gamma - ray intensity is much lower than the observed igrb ) , there is still room for additional cr populations .",
    "also , smc might not be a typical small galaxy , corresponding to the csfr curve we have used .",
    "for example smc might have had periods of much larger star formation than the present one , triggered by close flybys with the mw and their tidal interaction  @xcite .",
    "this could also lead to the production of additional cr population , only present during galaxy interaction .",
    "this cr population would not be present for a long time compared to the life of a galaxy , so their gamma - ray production in all unresolved smc - like galaxies would not violate the observed igrb , nor would it affect the present day gamma - ray flux of the smc .",
    "also , these tidal interactions would impact smaller galaxies more , so more lithium would be produced in the smc , but not in the mw . in",
    "@xcite it was shown that tidal interactions could be a very effective mechanism for lithium production in the smc , and that even a single close fly - by of mw and smc could produce a non - negligible abundance of lithium .",
    "the observed gamma - ray flux and lithium abundances of the smc imply a more interesting galactic history of this galaxy in order to fully explain both measurements and understand how the cr flux inside the galaxy has changed during the lifetime of the smc , which is something we will consider in the follow - up work .",
