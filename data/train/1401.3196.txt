    "in spite of many years of research the origin of superconductivity in cuprates is still controversial .",
    "the superconducting critical temperature ( @xmath0 ) follows an universal dome - shaped behavior ( dsb ) where its maximum value takes place at optimal doping ( @xmath4 ) , which separates underdoped ( ud ) from overdoped ( od ) regions .",
    "another universal feature is the @xmath3-wave symmetry of the superconducting gap which has a maximum on the fermi surface ( fs ) point in the @xmath5-@xmath6 direction ( antinodal direction ) and vanishes upon approaching the brillouin zone diagonal ( nodal direction).@xcite in addition , ud and od regions show very distinct normal state properties as observed , for instance , by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) and transport experiments .",
    "several macroscopic and microscopic experiments support the point of view that in ud a pseudogap ( pg ) appears in the normal state at a temperature @xmath7 which is well above @xmath8 and , in contrast to @xmath8 , increases with decreasing doping.@xcite    in spite of the consensus about the existence of the pg , its origin and nature remain elusive .",
    "two major scenarios were proposed to explain the pg . in one scenario it originates from preformed pairs above @xmath8.@xcite in the second one ,",
    "the pg is distinct from the superconducting gap and associated with a certain order which competes with superconductivity.@xcite several phenomenological models for the two - gap scenario have been proposed , but invoking different orders : @xmath3-wave charge density wave ( @xmath3-cdw),@xcite @xmath3-wave fermi surface deformations,@xcite charge density wave@xcite including stripes,@xcite phase separation,@xcite and others such as resonating - valence - bond - type charge order@xcite and loop - current order.@xcite    one dispute about the origin of superconductivity is whether pairing is originated by non - retarded or retarded interactions.@xcite in the latter case , as in the electron - phonon ( e - ph ) conventional superconductivity , the excitations responsible for the pairing glue should be also present in transport and dynamical properties in the normal state ( see ref . [ ] and references therein ) . on the other side , in the former case transport and dynamical properties in the normal state",
    "are not affected by the pairing interaction.@xcite non - retarded interactions were proposed earlier@xcite and still firmly supported.@xcite recent experiments suggest that pairing may be certainly non - retarded.@xcite    the common belief is that superconductivity is entangled with the pg physics .",
    "thus , a model candidate for describing cuprates must show @xmath3-wave superconductivity following a dsb and its relation with properties observed in the pg phase .",
    "the @xmath1-@xmath2 model treated in large - n expansions shows , at low doping and low temperature , tendencies to several kinds of instabilities , being the flux phase ( fp ) the leading one.@xcite below a transition temperature @xmath9 the fp is developed and the translational symmetry broken .",
    "the fp can be associated to the @xmath3-cdw phase which was proposed phenomenologically for describing the pg phase in cuprates.@xcite @xmath3-cdw and fp are characterized by orbital currents flowing in a staggered pattern around each plaquette .",
    "although the fp bears several characteristics for being considered as a candidate for the pg , the breaking of the translational symmetry and the existence of a phase transition are not clear from the experiments . on the other hand , non - retarded @xmath3-wave superconductivity triggered by the antiferromagnetic exchange @xmath2",

    "we have shown that several aspects related to the fermi arc phenomenology and admr features can be described considering self - energy effects near the fp instability .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the possibility that in the proximity to the fp instability , self - energy effects and non - retarded paring play together and develop a dsb for @xmath0 . at the same time",

    "this fact shows that the dsb of @xmath0 is related to the properties of the incoherent metal near the instability , and not to the coherent metal at low temperature and large doping .",
