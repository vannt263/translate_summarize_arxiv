    "there are many evidences that electrons are accelerated in snrs from observations in radio and nonthermal x - rays . instead , direct observational proofs about acceleration of protons in snr shocks are difficult to obtain because of small radiative ability of these particles .",
    "photons emitted in hadronic collisions may be observed in @xmath2-rays only .",
    "however , photons from inverse - compton interactions with electrons have the same energies .",
    "hadronic @xmath2-rays should dominate in systems with rather high magnetic field ( in order to reduce efficiency of leptonic @xmath2-rays ) and with high density of cold protons which are targets for relativistic protons accelerated by the snr shock .",
    "such conditions naturally appear when the shock moves in the medium with the high density , e.g. it enters into a molecular cloud .",
    "therefore , snrs located near molecular clouds are promising sites to observe hadronic @xmath2-rays @xcite .",
    "thus , there is a reason for a systematic search for such snrs @xcite .",
    "the shock in snr interacting with the molecular cloud decelerates because of increased density . as a result ,",
    "the temperature of the post - shock plasma decreases and radiative losses become important .",
    "the shock gradually transforms from the adiabatic to the radiative one ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the physics of the shock and conditions for particle acceleration change considerably .",
    "picture of snr evolution consists typically of the three stages  free expansion , adiabatic and radiative  each with its own features .",

    "it is often assumed that these phases change one another very rapidly comparing to the duration of the phases themselves .",
    "however , the transition from the fully adiabatic to the fully radiative shock lasts almost the same time as duration of the adiabatic stage @xcite .",

    "it is expected that such flow reconstruction has to result in the prominent increase of the hadronic @xmath2-rays ( due to the high density of target protons ) and the decrease of the lepronic @xmath2-rays ( due to synchrotron losses of electrons in high mf ) .",

    "note , that this effect also explains why @xmath103 is typically larger than @xmath106 on fig .",
    "[ fig_rho_max_log ] : the perpendicular component of mf @xmath140 .",
    "the component of mf parallel to the shock normal does not affect the flow structure during the whole evolution of snr .",
    "the parallel field depends on the hydrodynamic structure rather than vice versa .",
    "[ fig_plasma_beta]a , c explains this effect : the plasma @xmath26 is less than unity everywhere inside snr .",
    "spatial distributions of the perpendicular mf ( fig .",
    "[ fig_mf_perpendicular ] ) correlate with distributions of density ( fig .",
    "[ fig_plot_full ] ) because mf is frozen into the plasma . at the beginning of the post - adiabatic stage ,",
    "when the radiative losses are not essential yet , the distributions for mf of the intermediate strength ( @xmath141 ) are close to the self - similarity in respect of the value of @xmath95 ( like in the case of the parallel field ) .",
    "however , this property is quickly violated due to different behavior of the radiative loses in the flows modified by mf of the different strengths .",
    "the tangential mf is important factor in dynamics of the flows with shocks , in accordance with the values of the plasma @xmath26 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_plasma_beta]b , d ) .",
    "the strength of the perpendicular mf may reach quite high values on the post - adiabatic and radiative stages , even for small values @xmath142 because if @xmath26 is small then mf does not prevent plasma from high compression and the perpendicular mf is compressed to similar values as density .",
    "mf with higher @xmath116 limits the compression and the maximum value of the strength is smaller ( fig .",
    "[ fig_rho_max_log ] ) .",
    "the numerical code pluto was adopted and used for magneto - hydrodynamic simulations of flows with shock waves in supernova remnants with the radiative losses of plasma .",
    "calculations are performed for the case of the one - dimensional flows under conditions of spherical symmetry , in the interstellar medium with the uniform distributions of density and magnetic field .",
    "the role of mf in formation of the flow structure is revealed .",
    "it is significant only in the post - adiabatic and radiative phases .",
    "the pressure of the tangential mf prevents large compression of plasma and limits the level of maximum density in the radiative shell .",
    "radiative shell is more extended behind the perpendicular shock .",
    "these effects are more significant for larger values of mf strength .",
    "parallel mf does not affect the flow dynamic because its energy density is much smaller than the thermal energy density .",
    "radiative losses affect mostly the thermal energy .",
    "the magnetic energy increases mostly by reducing the kinetic energy .    at oblique shocks of the post - adiabatic snrs ,",
    "the perpendicular component of mf increases and the parallel component decreases .",
    "this mechanism may be responsible for the predominantly tangential orientation of mf in old snrs , as it is known from observations of the radio polarization @xcite .    at late times ,",
    "when the shock decelerates a lot and the mach number becomes small , efficiency of particle acceleration by the fermi mechanism considerably decreases . on the other hand , at these times the tangential mf dominates over most of the snr surface , even in the regions where the parallel mf was large at previous stages ( quasiparallel shocks ) .",
    "this probably keeps more or less effective further acceleration of particles due to the drift mechanism . especially in the view of the rather small shock velocity",
    ": the particles tied to mf lines might spend more times for multiple crossings of the ( quasi-)perpendicular shock until the mf line will be swept up downstream .",
    "the old post - adiabatic snrs or regions of snrs interacting with the high - density medium may be promising sources of hadronic @xmath2-rays .",
    "radiative losses in these objects essentially affect dynamics of the shock and structure of the flow .",
    "they cause considerable increase of density and mf strength in the radiative shell .",
    "therefore , prominent emission of hadronic @xmath2-rays should be generated there whereas the competing leptonic @xmath2-rays has to be substantially reduced under such conditions .",
    "all simulations were performed on the computational cluster in institute for applied problems in mechanics and mathematics .",
