    "liouville theory @xcite plays an important role in several branches of physics and mathematics .",
    "it is deeply related to the problem of uniformization of riemann surfaces ; it plays a major role in 2 + 1 dimensional gravity also in presence of matter ; it appears in two dimensional gravity as an outcome of the conformal anomaly , in non critical string theory , in special models of 2d critical string theory and in the ads - cft correspondence @xcite and recently in some d - brane models @xcite .",
    "there are practically three approaches to the quantum problem : the hamiltonian , the functional and the conformal bootstrap approach .",
    "the hamiltonian approach ( minkowski space ) was first pursued by curtright and thorn @xcite and by dhoker , friedman and jackiw @xcite . in papers",
    "@xcite it was shown that in presence of a ground state the theory develops a spontaneous symmetry breaking of poincar invariance and in particular of translational invariance . as a result",
    "the theory is defined on the half - line and of the whole conformal group , present in the classical action , only the subgroup @xmath2 survives . in @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) the theory is compactified on a circle , there is no ground state , but by properly modifying the energy momentum tensor it is possible to show that the emerging quantum theory is invariant under the whole conformal group .",
    "the central charge of the theory turns out to be @xmath3 , where @xmath4 being @xmath5 the coupling constant ; the dimension of the vertex function @xmath6 is @xmath7 .",
    "the functional approach @xcite has been used mostly at the formal level in combination with the conformal bootstrap approach .",
    "one accepts a priori the invariance of the theory under the full conformal group .",
    "some results are borrowed from the hamiltonian approach ; the integral computed at some special point in the space of the charges and interpolation formulae devised to extend the treatment to the general case .",
    "four point functions on the sphere ( or two point function on the pseudosphere ) are computed when one of the vertex function is a degenerate field ( teschner trick ) .",
    "consistency with the formulation in the crossed channel originates some difference equation . after imposing a further symmetry on the result one gets the final answer .",
    "the most important results are the exact expressions for the three point function on the sphere @xcite , the one point function on the pseudosphere ( zz - brane ) @xcite , and several similar results in the case of boundary conformal liouville theory ( fzzt - brane ) @xcite .",
    "the subject of this talk is to widen the range of applications of the standard functional approach . by this",
    "we mean the formulation in which one first computes a stable background and then integrates over the fluctuations around it .",
    "we shall see that it is possible to develop techniques which allow the resummation of infinite classes of feynman graphs and compare such results with formulas derived in the conformal bootstrap approach .",
    "there is a more general aspect in this kind of research .",
    "it is well know that a quantum field theory is characterized non only by an action but also by a regularization and renormalization procedure .",
    "thus there is a non trivial question to answer i.e. : which is the correct action to start with and which regularization procedure has one to adopt in order the produce perturbatively result which are consistent with invariance under the full conformal group ? as we shall see not all regularization procedures give rise to a field theory satisfying such requirements .",

    "<S> we develop a functional integral approach to quantum liouville field theory completely independent of the hamiltonian approach . to this end on the sphere topology we solve the riemann - hilbert problem for three singularities of finite strength and a fourth one infinitesimal , by determining perturbatively the poincar accessory parameters . </S>",
    "<S> this provides the semiclassical four point vertex function with three finite charges and a fourth infinitesimal . </S>",
    "<S> some of the results are extended to the case of @xmath0 finite charges and @xmath1 infinitesimal . with the same technique </S>",
    "<S> we compute the exact green function on the sphere on the background of three finite singularities . turning to the full quantum problem </S>",
    "<S> we address the calculation of the quantum determinant on the background of three finite charges and of the further perturbative corrections . </S>",
    "<S> the zeta function regularization provides a theory which is not invariant under local conformal transformations . instead by employing a regularization suggested in the case of the pseudosphere by zamolodchikov and zamolodchikov we obtain the correct quantum conformal dimensions from the one loop calculation </S>",
    "<S> and we show explicitly that the two loop corrections do not change such dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we then apply the method to the case of the pseudosphere with one finite singularity and compute the exact value for the quantum determinant . </S>",
    "<S> such results are compared to those of the conformal bootstrap approach finding complete agreement . </S>"
