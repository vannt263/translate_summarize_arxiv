    "in this talk , we briefly outline the main ideas , approaches and results which we developed in high parton density qcd ( hdqcd ) .",
    "high parton density qcd involves a system of partons at short distances in which the qcd coupling constant @xmath0 is small , but the density of partons becomes so large that we can not apply the usual methods of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "in essence , the theoretical problems here are non perturbative , but the origin of the non perturbative effects does not lie in long distances and large @xmath0 , which are present in the confinement region .",
    "first , we need to answer the question :     _ 1 .",
    "which parton density is high ? _    the quantative estimates of which density is high , we can obtain from the @xmath1-channel unitarity @xcite which we can use in two different form :    \\1 .",
    "@xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the size of the target , @xmath4 is the fine structure constant ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for explanation why we have @xmath4 ) . this constraint can be rewritten as @xcite @xcite@xcite [ 1 ] = 1 .",
    "@xmath5 , where @xmath6 stands for diffractive dissociation .",
    "this inequality gives .",
    "therefore ,    \\1 .",
    "if @xmath7 is very small ( @xmath8 ) , we have a low density qcd in which the parton cascade can be perfectly described by the dglap evolution equations @xcite ;    \\2 . if @xmath9 , we are in the transition region between low and high density qcd . in this region",
    "we can still use pqcd , but have to take into account the interaction between partons inside the partons cascade ;    \\3 .",
    "if @xmath10 , we reach the region of high parton density qcd . which we are going to discuss here",
    "before doing this we want to make a remark on parton densities in a nucleus . taking into account that for nucleus @xmath11 and @xmath12 , we can rewrite as [ 2 ] _",
    "a==a^_n 1 .",
    "therefore , for the case of an interaction with nucleii , we can reach a hdqcd region at smaller parton density than in a nucleon ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "fig.1 gives the kinematic plot @xmath13 with the line @xmath14 , which shows that the hdqcd effect should be seen at hera .",
    "two different theoretical approaches _    to understand these two approaches we have to look at the picture of a high energy interaction in the parton model .",
    "in the parton approach the fast hadron decays into point - like particles ( partons ) long before ( typical time @xmath15 ) the interaction with the target .",
    "however , during this time @xmath16 , all partons are in the coherent state which can be described by means of a wave function .",
    "the interaction of the slowest ( @xmath17 ) parton with the target completely destroys the coherence of the partonic wave function .",
    "the total cross section of such an interaction is equal to @xmath18 where    * @xmath19= _ flux ( _ @xmath20 * ? ! * _ ) of  wee \" partons ; _ * @xmath21= _ the cross section of the interaction of one  wee \" parton with the target .",
    "_    one can see directly from fig.2 that the number of  wee \" partons is rather large and it is equal to [ 4 ] ne^ < n > = with < n > = _ 0 ( 1/x);_0=c _ s. we have to renormalize the flux of  wee \" partons , since the total cross section is the number of interactions and if one has several  wee \" partons with the same momenta they only give rise to one interaction .",
    "if @xmath22 , we expect that the renormalization of the flux will be small , and we use an approach with the following typical ingredients :    @xmath23 parton approach ; @xmath23 shadowing corrections ; @xmath23 glauber approach ; @xmath23 reggeon - like technique ; @xmath23 agk cutting rules .",
    "however , when @xmath24 , we have to change our approach completely from the parton cascade to one based on semiclassical field approach , since due to the uncertainty principle @xmath25 , we can consider the phase as a small parameter .",
    "therefore , in this kinematic region our magic words are :    @xmath23 semi - classical gluon fields ; @xmath23 wiezs@xmath26cker - williams approximation ; @xmath23 effective lagrangian for hdqcd ; @xmath23 renormalization wilson group approach .",
    "it is clear , that for @xmath27 the most natural way is to approach the hdqcd looking for corrections to the perturbative parton cascade . in this approach the pqcd evolution",
    "has been naturally included , and it aims to describe the transition region . the key problem is to penetrate into the hdqcd region where @xmath28 is large . let us call this approach ",
    "pqcd motivated approach \" .    for @xmath29 ,",
    "the most natural way of doing is to use the effective lagrangian approach , and remarkable progress has been achieved both in writing of the explicit form of this effective lagrangian , and in understanding physics behind it @xcite .",
    "the key problem for this approach was to find a correspondence with pqcd .",
    "this problem has been solved @xcite .",
    "the * hottest news * of this conference is that these two approaches give the same evolution equation for the gluon structure function as reported by a. kovner @xcite .",
    "fig.3 shows the current situation on the frontier line in the offensive on hdqcd .",
    "_ 3 . pluses and minuses of pqcd motivated approach _",
    "the goal of this talk is to show you how we derive this evolution equation and explain what physics we can recover using this approach .",
    "let me list here the main advantages and shortcomings of this approach .",
    "i believe that the honest report on them will lead us to a deeper understanding of the main theoretical problems in hdqcd .     * + * * -s : *    \\1 .",
    "clear physical meaning of everything what we are doing ;    \\2 .",
    "transparent parameters that we are using for a selection of the feyman diagrams ;    \\3 .",
    "obvious interrelation with usual dglap evolution and the reggeon calculus (  soft \" phenomenology ) ;    \\4 .",
    "understandable limitation of the approach which actually means that we guarantee the accuracy of our theoretical calculations .",
    "in other word , this approach has reached a stage of a normal theory with a regular procedure of how to calculate corrections with respect to small parameters .",
    "\\5 . it has a clear feedback for such interesting problems as higher twist contributions , violation of factorization and so on .     *",
    " * * : *    there is * no hope * to obtain any formal ( operator ) approach to the problem and , therefore , to find a formal justification of the resummation technique .",
    "it means , that we can prove everything only in the framework of the feyman diagrams and in the framework of the operation rules with them .",
    "however , it means that we ignore , at least partly , non perturbative effects and that we are not able to formulate a procedure of calculation of such effects .",
    "let me illustrate why it is very important an operator proof giving two examples .",
    "\\1 . in the pqcd motivated approach",
    "we heavily use the so called leading log ( 1/x ) approximation in pqcd ( ll(x)a ) .",
    "the operation rule for ll(x)a is : @xmath30 we used the gluon structure function as an example .",
    "shows that we changed the order of two operation : summation over @xmath31 and limit at @xmath32 .",
    "do we have a proof for this ? as far as i know , the answer is * no*. we consider as a strong argument in favor , the fact that the calculation in the next - to - leading order in ll(x)a gives a reasonable answer .",
    "the real proof has been done only recently @xcite in the effective lagrangian approach , which leads to the ll(x)a of pqcd .",
    "one of the main non perturbative observable which enters any pqcd motivated calculation is so called the size of the target @xmath3 ( see ) . we know",
    "the meaning of this parameter , namely , this is a correlation radius between two gluon inside a target at @xmath33 . in the effective lagrangian approach",
    "we will be able to find an operator expression for this number , and to ask our friends from lattice qcd to calculate this value .",
    "i think this is the only reasonable way of how to take non perturbative qcd into account , at least , at present time .",
    "_ 4 . the glr equation _    the first attempt to take into account the parton - parton interaction in the pqcd motivated approach",
    "was done long ago @xcite .",
    "it was based on the simple idea that there are two processes in a parton cascade ( see fig.2 ) : ( i ) the probability of the emission of an extra gluon is proportional to @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the density of gluon in the transverse plane , namely [ 6 ] = ; and ( ii ) the annihilation of a gluon , or in other words a process in which the probability is proportional to @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 can be estimated as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the size of the parton produced in the annihilation process . for deep inelastic scattering , @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , in the parton cascade we have @xmath41    at @xmath42 only emission of new partons is essential , because @xmath43 and this emission is described by the dglap evolution equations .",
    "however , at @xmath44 the value of @xmath45 becomes so large that the annihilation of partons becomes important , and so the value of @xmath45 is diminished .",
    "the competition of these two processes we can write as an equation for the number of partons in a phase space cell ( @xmath46 ): .[9 ] = -^2 , or in terms of the gluon structure function @xmath47 [ 10 ] = x g(x , q^2- ( x g(x , q^2))^2 .",
    "this is the glr equation which gave the first theoretical basis for the consideration of hdqcd .",
    "this equation describes the transition region at very large values of @xmath48 , but a glance at fig.1 shows that we need a tool to penetrate the kinematic region of moderate and even small @xmath48 .",
    "glauber - mueller approach _",
    "we found that it is very instructive to start with the glauber approach to sc.the idea of how to write the glauber formula in qcd was originally formulated in two papers ref.@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite . however , the key paper for our problem is the second paper of a. mueller , who considered the glauber approach for the gluon structure function .",
    "the key observation is that the fraction of energy , and the transverse coordinates of the fast partons can be considered as frozen , during the high energy interaction with the target @xcite @xcite .",
    "therefore , the cross section of the absorption of gluon(@xmath49 ) with virtuality @xmath48 and bjorken @xmath50 can be written in the form : [ 11 ] ^n_tot(g^*)= @xmath51^ * \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the fraction of energy which is carried by the gluon , @xmath53 is the wave function of the transverse polarized gluon , and @xmath54 is the cross section of the interaction of the @xmath55- pair with transverse separation @xmath56 with the nucleus .",
    "mueller showed that can be reduced to [ mf ] x g^mf(x , q^2 ) = ^1_x _ ^ _ 0^ 2 \\ { 1 - e^- _ n^gg ( x^,r^2_t ) s(b^2_t ) } with @xmath57 and profile function @xmath58 chosen in the gaussian form : @xmath59    obviously , the mueller formula has a defect , namely , only the fastest partons ( @xmath55 pairs ) interact with the target .",
    "this assumption is an artifact of the glauber approach , which looks strange in the parton picture of the interaction . indeed ,",
    "in the parton model we expect that all partons not only the fastest ones should interact with the target . at first sight",
    "we can solve this problem by iteration ( see ref .",
    "it means that the first iteration will take into account that not only the fastest parton , but the next one will interact with the target , and so on .",
    "why equation ?",
    "_    we would like to suggest a new approach based on the evolution equation to sum all sc .",
    "however , we want to argue first , why an equation is better than any iteration procedure . to illustrate this point of view ,",
    "let us differentiate the mueller formula with respect to @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "it is easy to see that this derivative is equal to [ der ] = d",
    "b^2_t \\{1-e^-(x , r^2_=)s(b^2_t)}. the advantages of are    * everything enters at small distances ; * everything is under theoretical control ; * everything that is not known ( mostly non perturbative ) is hidden in the initial and boundary condition .    of course , we can not get rid of our problems changing the procedure of solution . indeed , the non - perturbative effects coming from the large distances are still important , but they are absorbed in the boundary and initial conditions of the equation .",
    "therefore , an equation is a good ( correct ) way to separate what we know ( small distance contribution ) from what we do nt ( large distance contribution ) .",
    "equation _",
    "we suggest the following way to take into account the interaction of all partons in a parton cascade with the target .",
    "let us differentiate the @xmath62-integrated mueller formula of in @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "it gives [ eq ] = \\ { c + ( _ g ( x , q^2 ) ) + e_1 ( _ g ( x , q^2 ) ) } , where @xmath65 is given by [ kappa ] ( x , q^2 ) = x g(x , q^2 ) .",
    "therefore , we consider @xmath66 on the l.h.s . of as the observable which is written through the solution of .    can be rewritten in the form ( for fixed @xmath67 ) [ eqka ] + = \\ { c + ( _ g ) + e_1 ( _ g ) } f(_g ) .",
    "this is the equation which we propose .",
    "nice properties of the equation : _    this equation has the following desirable properties :    1 .",
    "it sums all contributions of the order @xmath68 , absorbing them in @xmath69 , as well as all contributions of the order of @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , this equation solves the old problem , formulated in ref.@xcite , and for @xmath71 gives the complete solution to our problem , summing all sc ; 2 .",
    "the solution of this equation matches with the solution of the dglap evolution equation in the dla of perturbative qcd at @xmath72 ; 3 .   at small values of @xmath7 ( @xmath73 ) gives the glr equation .",
    "indeed , for small @xmath7 we can expand the r.h.s of keeping only the second term .",
    "rewriting the equation through the gluon structure function we obtain the glr equation @xcite with the coefficient in front of the second term as calculated by mueller and qiu @xcite ; 4 .",
    "the first iteration of this equation gives the mueller formula ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; 5 .   in general , everything that we know about sc is included in ; 6 .",
    "as has been mentioned , was reproduced by the effective lagrangian approach ( see a. kovner talk at this conference @xcite .",
    "the theory status of the equation _    here , we list all small ( large ) parameters that have been used to obtain :    * @xmath74 + these equations ( - ) give the conditions when we can absorb all @xmath75 - terms in the gluon structure function both in and in . * [ 15 ] .",
    "this is the main limitation of our resummation which stems from the contribution of so called enhanced diagrams ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for detail ) . *",
    "[ 16 ] n_c1 .",
    "where @xmath76 is the number of colours .",
    "we follow the veneziano principle @xcite of large @xmath76 resummation : we select the diagrams in leading order with respect to @xmath77 in each topologic configuration ( see ref . @xcite and references therein for a detail discussion of this point ) .",
    "_ 10 . asymptotic solution _    a first observation is the fact that has a solution which depends only on @xmath78 .",
    "indeed , one can check that @xmath79 is the solution of the following equation [ asym ] = f(_asymp ) .",
    "the solution to the above equation is [ assol ] ^_asymp(y)__asymp(y = y_0 ) = y - y_0 .",
    "one can see that leads to & _",
    "asymp(y ) y(y ) aty1 ; & [ asymsol ] + & or x g(x , q^2)q^2r^2 ( 1/x)((1/x))atx0&we claim this solution is the asymptotic solution of . to prove this we have to consider the stability of the asymptotic solution .",
    "it means , that we solve our general equation looking for the solution of the form [ stab ] = _ asymp(y)+(y,- _ 0 ) , where @xmath80 is small ( @xmath81 ) but an arbitrary function at @xmath82 .",
    "we have to prove that will not lead to big @xmath80 ( @xmath83 ) at large @xmath84 .",
    "the following linear equation can be written for @xmath80 [ 109 ] + = |_= _ asymp(y)(y , ) . in ref.@xcite",
    "it was proven , that the solution of is much smaller than @xmath7 , since @xmath85 at large @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , the asymptotic solution has a chance to be the solution of in the region of very small @xmath50 . to prove this",
    ", we need to solve the equation in the wide kinematic region starting with the initial condition .",
    "we managed to do this only in the semiclassical approach .",
    "the semiclassical approach _    in the semiclassical approach the solution of is supposed to be of the form [ s1 ] = e^s , where @xmath86 is a function with partial derivatives : @xmath87 and @xmath88 which are smooth functions of @xmath78 and @xmath84 .    for an equation in the form",
    "@xmath89 we can introduce the set of characteristic lines @xmath90 , which satisfy a set of well defined equations ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite for the method ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite we developed a detailed calculation of the solution .",
    "the set of equations is : [ s3 ] = ; = ( s ) ; = s ; where @xmath91 .",
    "the initial conditions for this set of equations s_0 = ln _ in ( y_0 , _ 0 ) ; _ 0 = .",
    "[ s7 ] the main properties of these equations have been considered in ref.@xcite analytically . here ,",
    "however , we restrict ourselves mostly to the numerical solution of these equations .    fig .",
    "[ scn ] shows the behaviour of trajectories and @xmath92 value for the solution .",
    "one can see that the trajectories can be divided in two groups : ( i ) first with @xmath93 , and all of them approach the trajectories of the dglap evolution equation at large @xmath48 ; and ( ii ) second one with @xmath94 and the solution of on these trajectories tends to the asymptotic solution at @xmath95 .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we consider this figure as a nice illustration of our statement that the high energy ( low @xmath50 ) limit of the general solution to is the asymptotic solution .",
    "comparison with other approaches _    in fig.[scc ] we plot our calculation for the dglap evolution equation , for the glauber - mueller approach , for the glr equation and for the new evolution equation .",
    "we can conclude , that :    1 .",
    "sc even in the glauber - mueller approach are essential for the gluon structure function ; 2 .",
    "the glauber - mueller approach considerably underestimates the value of sc ; 3 .",
    "the glr equation leads to stronger sc than the solution to ; 4 .",
    "the new evolution equation does not reproduce the saturation of the gluon density in the region of small @xmath50 which the glr equation leads to .",
    "_ 13 . where are sc ? _",
    "the value of sc is rather large but only in the gluon structure function while their contribution to @xmath96 is rather small @xcite , and can not be seen on the background of the experimental errors ;      \\3 .",
    "the statement that sc have not been seen is also not quite correct .",
    "our estimates @xcite show that the contribution of sc is rather large in the @xmath96 slope and incorporating the sc one can describe the recent experimental data @xcite on @xmath98 ( see ref.@xcite for detail ) .",
    "i hope that i gave you a brief but to some extent full review of our approach .",
    "obviously , you can obtain more information from two large papers of ref .",
    "deeply in my heart , i firmly believe that there will be a bright future for the effective lagrangian approach in which one combines the physics of hdqcd , with the formal methods of the quantum field theory , and gives a way to incorporate the lattice calculation for the non - perturbative observables .",
    "however , the parameter or better to say a newscale @xmath99 which is the solution of the equation @xmath100 only can be found in the pqcd motivated approach , since the effective lagrangian was only derived and justified assuming this new scale . the fact that the correct equation was first found in this approach is also not accidental . since the pqcd motivated approach has a great advantage : clear understanding of physics of hdqcd .",
