    "recently , the need for increasing coherence times of superconducting qubits motivated new interest in searching for low - loss dielectric materials as well as understanding their loss mechanism . internal quality factors of several types of superconducting thin - film resonators@xcite have been measured in detail . the most common way to measure",
    "the internal quality factor is to measure the s - parameters of resonant circuits . for this purpose",
    ", a number of methods were developed to extract the quality factor of a single resonator from reflection or transmission measurements@xcite . in order to measure multiple resonators simultaneously ,",
    "methods@xcite based on frequency multiplexing have been developed .",
    "however , all the previous methods derive the scattering parameters ( s - parameters)@xcite by using equivalent coupled circuits in the vicinity of the resonance . in this paper",
    ", we present a consistent method to approximate the exact s - parameters by analyzing the algebraic properties of the s - parameter function .",
    "we start from a circuit model in which a lc resonator couples to a transmission line both inductively and capacitively .",
    "we develop the closest pole and zero method ( cpzm ) to reduce the transmission s - parameter @xmath0 , with @xmath1 the excitation frequency , of the circuit to a ratio of complex linear functions .",
    "the approximated @xmath0 only depends on four parameters : resonance frequency @xmath4 , internal quality factor @xmath5 , external quality factor @xmath6 and a parameter @xmath7 which is related to the resonance asymmetry .",
    "the internal quality factor @xmath5 can be extracted from fitting the data to the simplified @xmath0 function as opposed to the full circuit - dependent form .",
    "we also discuss another important aspect of dielectric loss characterization . in order to understand sources and mechanisms of the loss ,",
    "the dependence of dielectric loss on energy stored in the resonator is required .",
    "the energy dependence of loss can be characterized@xcite by measuring @xmath5 as a function of the voltage @xmath2 across the capacitor in the lc resonator .",
    "however , this is a nontrivial task since one usually does not have precise knowledge of all the circuit parameters needed to calculate @xmath2 .",
    "we show that the ratio @xmath8 , where @xmath3 is the forward propagating wave amplitude at the excitation port , can be calculated using parameters determined from the fit of the @xmath0 function and an additional scaling factor .",
    "the scaling factor depends on circuit parameters which can not be directly determined from the fit . however , it can be estimated based on circuit parameter simulations . an important point to note",
    "is that the knowledge of the voltage @xmath2 up to a fixed factor is still valuable for comparing experimental results with theoretical predictions of the loss mechanism .",
    "although the reduced @xmath9 fits the experimental data extremely well , in some measurements the resonance curve shows a pronounced asymmetry , which is inconsistent with realistic values of circuit parameters .",
    "we analyze a more complete model which takes the reflection of wire bonds and impedance mismatch into account .",
    "we find that for realistic circuits the asymmetric resonance primarily arises from wave reflection by the wire bonds used to connect the device and the measurement apparatus .",
    "we show that despite these non - idealities , our procedure for extracting @xmath5 based on the simplified @xmath9 form is still valid .",
