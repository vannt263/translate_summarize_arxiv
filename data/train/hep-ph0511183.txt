    "over the last decade much progress has been realized towards understanding the qcd dynamics at high energies .",
    "the successful operation of the desy @xmath1 collider hera has opened a new era of experimental and theoretical investigation into the deep structure of the proton and , in general , of hadronic interactions .",
    "some of the most important observations are the striking rise of the proton structure function @xmath2 for small values of the bjorken variable @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , the large contribution of diffractive processes in this kinematical range and the geometric scaling ( for a recent review , see e.g. ref .",
    "theoretically , at small @xmath3 , due to the large gluon density , we expect the transition of the regime described by the linear dynamics , where only the parton emissions are considered , for a new regime where the physical process of recombination of partons become important in the parton cascade and the evolution is given by a nonlinear evolution equation .",
    "this regime is characterized by the limitation on the maximum phase - space parton density that can be reached in the hadron wavefunction ( parton saturation ) , with the transition being specified by a typical scale , which is energy dependent and is called saturation scale @xmath5 ( for recent reviews see ref .",
    "although the hera experimental results have a natural interpretation in terms of the saturation physics , due to the kinematical limitations of the experiment none of these phenomena can be taken as a conclusive evidence for a new regime of the qcd dynamics .",
    "currently , the hera ii run has obtained much more precise experimental data , but they are limited at center of mass energies smaller than 300 gev , where deviations between linear and saturation predictions are small .",
    "consequently , our understanding of the correct qcd dynamics at high energies is still an open question . as hera will stop its operations , in principle , in 2007 , and",
    "the qcd dynamics must be known as precisely as possible in order to maximize the discovery potential for new physics at the next generation of colliders , the study of alternatives which could constrain the qcd dynamics is timely and necessary .    in this letter",
    "we study the photoproduction of heavy quarks and vector mesons in the coherent proton - nucleus ( @xmath0 ) interactions at rhic and lhc energies and analyze if these processes can be used to determine the qcd dynamics at high energies ( for similar studies on @xmath6 and @xmath7 collisions , see refs .",
    "the main advantage of using colliding hadron and nuclear beams for studying photon induced interactions is the high equivalent photon energies and luminosities that can be achieved at existing and future accelerators ( for a recent discussion see ref .",
    "lets consider the proton - nucleus interaction at large impact parameter ( @xmath8 ) and at ultrarelativistic energies . in this regime",
    "we expect the electromagnetic interaction to be dominant .",
    "when we consider the electromagnetic field associated to the proton and ion , we have that due to the coherent action of all protons in the nucleus , the electromagnetic field surrounding the ion is very larger than the proton one .",
    "this result can be easily understood if we use the weiszcker - williams method to calculate the equivalent flux of photons from a charge @xmath9 nucleus a distance @xmath10 away , which is given by ( for recent reviews see ref .",

    "@xmath9 is proportional to @xmath17 . due to asymmetry in the collision , with the ion being likely the photon emitter , we have that the photon direction is known , which will implicate an asymmetry in the rapidity distribution ( see below ) .",
    "the coherence condition limits the photon virtuality to very low values @xmath18 , which implies that for most purposes , these can be considered as real .",
    "therefore , coherent @xmath0 collisions can be used in order to study photon - proton interactions .    the requirement that photoproduction is not accompanied by hadronic interaction ( ultraperipheral collision )",
    "can be done by restricting the impact parameter @xmath10 to be larger than the sum of the proton and the nuclear radius .",
    "therefore , the total photon flux interacting with the target nucleus is given by eq .",
    "( [ fluxunint ] ) integrated over the transverse area of the target for all impact parameters subject to the constraint that the proton and the nucleus do not interact hadronically .",

    "the cross section for the photoproduction of a final state @xmath23 in a coherent @xmath0 collisions will be given by , @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the c.m.s energy of the proton - nucleus system .",
    "considering @xmath28 collisions at lhc , the lorentz factor is @xmath29 , giving the maximum c.m.s . @xmath30",
    "energy @xmath31 gev .",
    "therefore , while studies of photoproduction at hera are limited to photon - proton center of mass energies of about 200 gev , photon - proton interactions at lhc can reach one order of magnitude higher on energy .",
    "consequently , studies of @xmath32 interactions at lhc could provide valuable information on the qcd dynamics at high energies . in this work",
    "we consider that the produced state @xmath23 represents a @xmath33 pair or a vector meson @xmath34 .",
    "since photon emission is coherent over the entire nucleus and the photon is colorless we expect that the events to be characterized by one ( heavy quark production , with @xmath35 being the remaining of the proton ) or two ( vector meson production , with @xmath36 ) rapidity gaps .",
    "the photon - hadron interaction at high energy ( small @xmath3 ) is usually described in the infinite momentum frame of the hadron in terms of the scattering of the photon off a sea quark , which is typically emitted by the small-@xmath3 gluons in the proton . however , in order to disentangle the small-@xmath3 dynamics of the hadron wavefunction , it is more adequate to consider the photon - hadron scattering in the dipole frame , in which most of the energy is carried by the hadron , while the photon has just enough energy to dissociate into a quark - antiquark pair before the scattering . in this representation",
    "the probing projectile fluctuates into a quark - antiquark pair ( a dipole ) with transverse separation @xmath37 long after the interaction , which then scatters off the proton @xcite .",
    "the main motivation to use this color dipole approach , is that it gives a simple unified picture of inclusive and diffractive processes . in particular , in this approach the heavy quark photoproduction cross section reads as , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the light - cone wavefunction of the photon @xcite .",
    "the quark and antiquark helicities are labeled by @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the variable @xmath37 defines the relative transverse separation of the pair ( dipole ) and @xmath42 @xmath43 is the longitudinal momentum fractions of the quark ( antiquark ) .",
    "the basic blocks are the photon wavefunction , @xmath44 and the dipole - target cross section , @xmath45 .",
    "for photoproduction we have that longitudinal piece does not contribute , since @xmath46 , and the total cross section is computed introducing the appropriated mass and charge of the charm or bottom quark .    similarly ,",

    "the orders of magnitude are similar for rhic and lhc , with main deviations coming from different choices for the gluon pdfs and distinct factorization scale .",
    "our estimates considering cgc ( collinear ) for rhic are 142 ( 110 ) @xmath56b for charm and 0.15 ( 0.10 ) @xmath56b for bottom .",
    "the rapidity distributions can be also contrasted with estimations in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the heavy quark photoproduction in @xmath7 and @xmath6 collisions have been computed . to see what is difference in the order of magnitude among them",
    "let us perform a few parametric estimates .",
    "roughly , the photon flux on nuclei is approximately @xmath17 the flux on proton , @xmath83 .",
    "moreover , for heavy quarks have been not verified large nuclear shadowing @xcite such that @xmath84 .",
    "the ratio between @xmath0 production and @xmath6 ( or @xmath7 ) can be estimated as @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , using eq .",
    "( [ dsigdy ] ) , one obtains @xmath86 and the enhancement reaches a factor @xmath87 for heavy nuclei in the comparison between photoproduction on @xmath0 and in energetic protons . on the other hand , one obtains @xmath88 and then @xmath0 is suppressed in relation to @xmath7 by a factor @xmath89",
    "however , the larger @xmath0 luminosity , which is two order of magnitude higher than for @xmath7 , counteracts this suppression for the event rates .    concerning coherent meson production , in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] one presents predictions for the rapidity distribution on @xmath0 collisions at lhc energy considering both light ( @xmath90 ) and heavy ( @xmath91 ) ions .",
    "these theoretical predictions are original in the literature .",
    "the corresponding integrated cross sections ( event rates ) are shown in tab .",
    "[ tabhq ] , having high rates . for completeness",
    ", we have computed the estimation for typical light meson ( @xmath92 ) and a heavy one ( @xmath93 ) . for rhic ,",
    "the cross section are 13 mb ( 0.8 @xmath56b ) for @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) production .",
    "these results can be contrasted with those obtained in the refs .",
    "we can do a similar estimative of the ratio as for heavy quarks considering that for light mesons @xmath94 and for heavy mesons @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "therefore , an enhancement of @xmath17 for @xmath96 remains but now @xmath97 , respectively . for pb ions at lhc",
    "this is a factor 35 for @xmath92 and a factor @xmath98 for @xmath93 .",
    "it should be noticed that the coherent production of mesons is currently measured at rhic for the @xmath7 case .",
    "therefore , the present estimation could be tested in @xmath99 collisions with a good experimental feasibility . for comparison ,",
    "we also present in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] the prediction from the color transparency limit of the cgc model , which is obtained assuming that @xmath100 is given in all kinematic range by its value for @xmath101 .",
    "it is equivalent to disregard the saturation physics , which allows to estimate the importance of the cgc physics in the process .",
    "we have that the predictions for @xmath93 production are somewhat similar , which is expected , since the heavy vector meson production is dominated by small pair separations , where the saturation physics does not contribute significantly .",
    "on the other hand , the photoproduction of @xmath92 mesons is dominated by physics below saturation scale .",
    "the difference is huge , reaching 3 orders of magnitude in rapidity distribution , which demonstrate the importance of the saturation physics on this process .",
    "finally , lets comment on the uncertainties and model dependence for the results presented here . for the heavy quarks ( hq ) production , the main theoretical uncertainties are the higher order corrections in perturbative expansion and the quark masses . within the perturbative qcd collinear formalism , the higher order corrections for hq photoproduction are quite small ( a few percents ) in contrast to the hadroproduction case and they can be taken into account by a suitable choice for the quark mass @xcite . the color dipole formalism , which we use in our analysis , contains contributions of higher orders by definition as it is equivalent to the semihard factorization ( or @xmath102-factorization ) approach in leading logarithm approximation . the latter is well known to include higher order perturbative qcd diagrams in its formulation .",
    "concerning the dglap results ( collinear formalism ) , the uncertainties for different choices of the gluon distribution are small as it is probed at a relatively large scale @xmath103 ( approximately 9 gev@xmath104 for charm and 81 gev@xmath104 for bottom ) .",
    "those uncertainties are known to take place at low virtualities @xmath105 1 - 3 gev@xmath104 . moreover ,",
    "our results are an extrapolation of the photoproduction cross section for energies beyond energies of current accelerator regime using the physical parameters which describe correctly both the low energy ( fixed target ) and the hera data points .",
    "therefore , the present estimates should be reliable . concerning vector meson production , in general",
    "it is described by quite distinct approaches for light and heavy mesons . in the light meson case ,",
    "the old vector meson dominance ( vmd ) model is often adopted @xcite , whereas for the heavy mesons a leading logarithmic approximation of the collinear approach is considered @xcite . in this case , the hard qcd scale is given by the vector meson mass .",
    "we have used the unique theoretical formalism available describing simultaneously light and heavy vector meson production @xcite . once again , the parameters of the model are fixed in order to describe the experimental low energy and desy - hera datasets . the transition between light and heavy mesons is dynamically introduced by parton saturation effects ( via saturation scale ) in the proton target .",
    "the qcd dynamics at high energies is of utmost importance for building a realistic description of @xmath106 collisions at lhc . in this limit qcd evolution leads to a system with high gluon density .",
    "we have shown if such system there exists at high energies it can be proven in coherent @xmath0 collisions at lhc .",
    "we propose two specific final states ( heavy quarks and mesons ) where the experimental identification could be feasible .",
    "it should be noticed , however , that the predictions presented here were based on specific models / assumptions for the process and on recent phenomenological investigations .",
    "therefore , these assumptions should be tested in future @xmath0 experimental investigations .",
