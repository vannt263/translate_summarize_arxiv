    "it is well known that quantized vortices play an important role in understanding many phenomena of superfluid , superconductivity and even astrophysics . in the latest several years",
    "a remarkable experimental development has been made in the rapidly rotating bose - einstein condensate(bec ) .",
    "a large amount of angular momentum is imparted into the system and its rotation frequency becomes faster and faster .",
    "the ground state of the fast rotating bec was observed to be a regular triangular vortex lattice at nearly zero temperature .",
    "this provides a new stage of studying both the equilibrium and the dynamic properties of the vortex matter .",
    "recently two novel experiments were reported by cornell s group in jila.@xcite@xcite atoms in the hyperfine spin @xmath0 state , were rotated rapidly by the evaporative spin - up mechanism . about @xmath1 vortices",
    "were observed in the cloud and they were arranged into a regular lattice structure . and then , an atom removal laser , whose frequency was tuned to the transition energy between the @xmath0 state and the @xmath2 state , was applied to the center of the condensate , and the recoil from a spontaneously scatted photon blasts atoms out of the condensate . in this way , the atoms with lower angular momentum were selectively removed from the system .",
    "many exotic features were observed when this technique is applied . after the atom removal laser was applied continuously , the vortex number contained in the cloud increased form @xmath1 to about @xmath3 , and the vortices began to aggregate to the center of the condensate , eventually they formed a giant vortex .",
    "if the laser was applied for a short limited time , it was reported in ref.@xcite that a periodic formation and disappearance of the giant vortex core was observed after applying a strong atom removal pulse , and in ref.@xcite that the tkachenko oscillation of the vortex lattice would be found after a weak pulse .",
    "both kinds oscillation were found damped .",
    "@xcite@xcite    a number of questions are raised from these experiments , such as how to understand the vortex number increase and the vortices aggregating to the center of condensate , why the strong and weak laser strength will cause two different kinds of oscillations , how to understand the relation between the oscillation frequency and the initial conditions of the condensate , and which mechanism leads to the damping .",
    "we notice that recently there are lots of theoretical efforts around these experiments , some of them try to understand these observations numerically@xcite , and some of them focus on the tkachenko wave of the vortex lattice state@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "however , in this paper , we will present an explanation to these questions from another point of view , namely using a dual @xmath4-dimensional maxwell electrodynamic ( med ) description , and we will show that the main features observed can be understood naturally in this framework , although qualitatively in some aspects .",
    "this dual electromagnetic description of the interacting bosons model was obtained by the duality transformation early in the study of helium superfluidity,@xcite@xcite and then in the past decades it has been discussed in the contents of superconductivity and superfluid film by various authors.@xcite@xcite compared to the model discussed before , we would like to emphasize some important differences of the system studied here .",
    "first , a large amount of angular momentum have been imparted into the atoms and the rotational invariance is restored before the formation of condensate , therefore the total angular momentum of the condensate should be conserved to a non - zero value .",
    "the second , the atom removal laser violates the current conservation condition . and the third , the system is dilute and the interaction between atoms is weak , the sound velocity is consequently relatively small .",
    "we will show that these differences lead to these exotic phenomena in these experiments , in other words , these observed phenomena reflect some intrinsic properties of the rotating bec .",
    "in this section we will firstly make a brief description of the dual picture for the interacting bosons system , for the details we refer to the ref.@xcite@xcite@xcite . beginning with the coherent state path integral formulism,@xcite we write down the quantum mechanical propagator @xmath5\\exp\\{i\\int dt d^2\\vec{r } \\mathcal{l}\\ } } ,",
    "\\label{partition}\\ ] ] where the lagrangian @xmath6 @xmath7 is the interaction strength and equals to @xmath8 for ultracold atomic system , where @xmath9 is the @xmath10-wave scattering length between atoms . here",
    "@xmath11 is a complex field describing the bosonic many - body system , and @xmath12 is its complex conjecture",
    ". we can factor @xmath13 as @xmath14 .",
    "the field @xmath15 describes the density of bosons .",
    "the phase of @xmath11 contains two parts , @xmath16 is the smooth part free from singularity and @xmath17 is that caused by the presence of vortices .",
    "first of all , we can introduce an auxiliary field @xmath18 by performing a hubbard - stratanovich ( h - s ) transformation , the physical meaning of which is the superfluid current . by defining the three vectors @xmath19 and @xmath20 , in the low frequency and long wavelength limits",
    "one can neglect the second order gradient term @xmath21 , and obtain that @xmath22d[\\rho ] d[\\theta ] d[\\theta_{v } ] \\exp\\left\\{i\\int dt d^2\\vec{r } \\left(-\\tilde{j}\\cdot\\tilde{\\nabla}\\theta-\\tilde{j}\\cdot\\tilde{\\nabla}\\theta_{v } + \\frac{m}{2\\rho}|\\vec{j}|^2 -\\frac{g}{2}\\rho^2\\right)\\right\\}.\\nonumber\\\\\\label{hstransformation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] integrating over @xmath16 , one can naturally obtain a @xmath23-function constraint @xmath24 , which is just the conventional current conservation condition @xmath25    owing to this constraint , we can introduce a three - component gauge field @xmath26 defined as @xmath27 , which satisfies @xmath28 the density and the current of the bosons are thereby determined by the gauge field . hence , @xmath29 is compared to a magnetic field perpendicular to the 2-dimensional plane .",
    "we can expand @xmath15 as @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the average density which is compared to an external magnetic field , while @xmath32 is the density fluctuation which is compared to the electromagnetic wave . the electric field @xmath33 is defined as @xmath34 , and it is perpendicular to the boson current @xmath18 .",
    "therefore the eq.([currentconservation ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath35 which is just the maxwell equation in a monopole free space - time .    with replacing the @xmath15 by @xmath31 in the denominator , the last two terms in eq.([hstransformation ] )",
    "can also be reexpressed in terms of the gauge field @xmath26 , which is just the dynamic term @xmath36 of the gauge field as in the conventional med .",
    "it determines the dynamic properties of boson density fluctuation , i.e. phonon , and recovers the well - known result for the sound velocity @xmath37 , which plays the same role as the light velocity in @xmath4-dimensional med .",
    "the coupling between the vortices and bosons can be illustrated as @xmath38 here @xmath39 is defined as @xmath40 .",
    "it can be verified that the zero - component of @xmath39 , which is denoted by @xmath41 , represents the vortex density , and the other two spatial components represent the vortex current .",
    "the eq.([a14 ] ) indicates that the vortices can be viewed as charged particles , which are coupled to an electromagnetic field via gauge coupling . the coupling constant , that is the charge @xmath42 of the charged particles , is unit . in the coulomb gauge ,",
    "the scalar potential @xmath43 is instantaneous , one can integrate it out and obtain the mass of vortex @xmath44 , which is equal to @xmath45 for a uniform condensate , and the mutual logarithmic interaction between vortices described by @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the radius of the condensate and @xmath48 is the radius of vortex core .",
    "thus we have obtained a dual electrodynamic description of quantized vortices , which is briefly summarized in the following table . in the dual picture",
    "the vortex lattice state corresponds to the wigner crystal state of 2-dimensional electrons in the external magnetic field . +    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      +   + such a description can be directly applied to the confined bec when it is in the thomas - fermi regime .",
    "the average density here is therefore determined by the trapping potential , as well as the centrifugal repulsive force caused by rotating , and we will take it as inverted parabola in this regime . here",
    "we would like to point out that the main assumption leading to the electrodynamic description is that the vortices are treated as point - like particles , the physics inside the vortex core is not considered , as a consequence we take the mass of vortex as its electromagnetic mass throughout this paper@xcite .",
    "besides , in the following treatment we view the system as quasi - two dimensional and neglect the density inhomogeneity when estimating the vortex mass . in the quantum hall mean field regime@xcite , it is shown that the physics of vortex core will become important . however , before entering this regime , and when the thomas - fermi theory is still valid , these neglected effects will only slightly renormalize the vortex mass as well as the interaction between vortices .",
    "in jila experiments the rotational invariance is restored before condensation , therefore the condensate should obey the total angular momentum conservation constraint . such a system can be described by adding a lagrange multiplier term to the lagrangian . @xmath49",
    "it is obvious that one will obtain a @xmath23-function which means that the total angular momentum must always equal to @xmath50 after integrating @xmath51 out .",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath51 is in fact the effective rotation frequency . following the procedure discussed in above section",
    ", it is found that only three additional terms , namely @xmath52 , will be added to the lagrangian .",
    "one can see that only the zeroth component of the gauge field responds to the rotation .",
    "integrating @xmath51 out and neglecting the density fluctuation , we obtain @xmath53 following the same step which leads to eq.([log - interaction ] ) , integrating out @xmath43 , we can obtain a local chemical potential term in the following lagrangian @xmath54 here @xmath55 is the green s function for the @xmath43 field acquiring a very small mass @xmath56 , which will vanish in the large atom number limit . the first term in the eq .",
    "( [ chenmicalporential ] ) indicates that the vortex system can be viewed as an interacting coulomb gas system , and the second term defines a local chemical potential @xmath57 for vortices emerging from the angular momentum constraint , which is proportional to @xmath58 .",
    "the atom removal laser , which removes atoms with lower angular momentum , decreases the atom density @xmath15 with little change to the total angular momentum @xmath50 , leads to the increase of the vortex chemical potential .",
    "notice that the interaction energy @xmath59 depends quadratically dependence on vortex density @xmath41 , and the interaction between vortices are repulsive , so @xmath60 this shows the increase of vortex density .",
    "for simplicity we assume that the atom removal laser acts only at the center point .",
    "extension to the gaussian shape laser is straightforward and the qualitative results will not be changed .",
    "when the laser is applied , a centripetal atom current will be induced and the current conservation condition will be violated at the center . in the dual picture ,",
    "a circular electric field will be generated and the maxwell equation should be modified in the following way @xmath61 here the value of @xmath62 equals to the number of atoms removed from the condensate per unit time .",
    "therefore it is modelled as a monopole current running through the plane .",
    "the magnitude of the electric field is approximately @xmath63 nearby the center . for the case of continuous laser the vortices as charges will be accelerated azimuthally by the electric field , and the lorentz force will drive the vortices to aggregate toward the center , and eventually to form a giant vortex .      after a pulse laser which only acts for a short time @xmath64",
    ", the vortices will acquire a velocity @xmath65 and leave the balance positions of the lattice .",
    "for the vortices closest to the center , the magnitudes of their velocities can be approximated by @xmath66 @xmath67 is the vortex lattice spacing .",
    "therefore , there are two forces which can cause the oscillation motion , one is the lorentz force @xmath68 , and the other is the mutual interaction force between vortices @xmath69 .",
    "it is easy to obtain the ratio of the two forces : @xmath70 for these experiments we can naturally assume that the number of atoms removed from the condensate @xmath62 is an increase function of the power of removal laser . thus eq.([radio ] ) indicates that the lorentz force is dominant for a strong laser pulse , such as the pulse used in ref.@xcite . in this limit",
    ", the vortices will execute circumnutation .",
    "when the vortices move very close to each other , they will merge into a giant vortex , and separate into several single vortices again when they oscillate away from each other .",
    "the mutual interaction force will be dominant for the weak pulse case . in this limit",
    ", it will cause a collective oscillation of vortex lattice known as tkachenko oscillation .",
    "the oscillation frequency @xmath71 depends on the initial conditions of the condensate , such as the number of atoms and the rotation frequency @xmath51 . in the strong pulse limit , for the motion",
    "is mostly determined by the lorentz force , @xmath72 . because the density @xmath15 is proportional to the number of atoms @xmath73 and",
    "is a decreasing function of the rotation frequency @xmath51 , the oscillation frequency is linearly dependent on @xmath73 and increases with @xmath51 decreasing .    in the weak pulse limit ,",
    "the oscillation frequency @xmath71 is proportional to @xmath74 .",
    "it is not obvious to tell whether @xmath71 will decrease or not when the condensate rotates faster , because both @xmath15 and @xmath67 will decrease with the rotation frequency @xmath51 increasing .",
    "we make a rough estimate as following : for a fast rotating bec confined in a harmonic trap with trapping frequency @xmath75 , the effective confining potential is @xmath76 . using the thomas - fermi approximation",
    "we can obtain that the condensate density nearby the center @xmath31 is proportional to @xmath77 , and then using the formula @xmath78 , we can obtain that @xmath79 here @xmath80 is a complicated constant , which is related to the atom mass , vortex mass , trap frequency and the density distribution along the third spatial dimension .",
    "the eq.([fomega ] ) shows that @xmath71 is a decreasing function of @xmath51 when @xmath81 , which is shown in the left side of fig.([fig : f - omega])@xcite .     as a function of rotational frequency of condensate @xmath51(in the unit of @xmath75 ) .",
    "[ fig : f - omega],width=268 ]    from above discussion we can see the atomic current toward the center is of essential importance for causing oscillations . hence if there is any other ways to generate a similar atomic current , such as using optical dipole force to draw atoms into the middle of the condensate in the ref.@xcite , the similar oscillation of vortex lattice was observed .",
    "( in the unit of oscillation period @xmath82 ) [ fig : damping],width=268 ]      one feature of these oscillation motions shown in these experiments is that the oscillation amplitudes are heavily damped , especially for the tkachenko oscillation reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is quite natural in the view of the dual picture .",
    "because the coupling between the vortex current and the phonon field is a gauge coupling , an accelerated vortex will radiate sound wave in the same way as an accelerated electron radiating electromagnetic wave .",
    "in the view of hydrodynamic picture , when a vortex is accelerating , the circular current @xmath18 , as well as the singularities of field @xmath18 , can not be stationary in any inertial frame . due to the current conservation condition eq.([currentconservation ] ) , a time dependent density fluctuation @xmath32 will be generated .",
    "hence the oscillating vortices will induce sound wave , lose their energy and result in the damping of amplitude . in the dual picture",
    "this process can be calculated through a standard med calculation .",
    "the retarded green s function for @xmath83 med is @xmath84 and the gauge potential @xmath85 for the radiation field is @xmath86 here @xmath87 is the vortex @xmath88-current . unlike the @xmath89d case , the green s function contains the step function @xmath90 instead of dirac s @xmath23 function , so one can not easily find a general expression for the radiation energy of a charge with arbitrary acceleration.@xcite@xcite here we only consider two special cases , the linear oscillation @xmath91 , and circular motion @xmath92 . following the approximation made in ref.@xcite , we replace @xmath93 with @xmath47 and calculate the energy radiation along large circle @xmath94 .",
    "then we can perform an analytical calculation for the average energy radiated over one period , @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the poynting vector .",
    "for these two special cases , the result is @xmath97 the radiation rate is inverse proportional to the interaction strength @xmath7 , so the damping effect is remarkable for the weak interacting boson gases . recalling the approximate expression for the vortex mass @xmath98 , eq.([radiationpower ] ) can be reexpressed as @xmath99 hence @xmath100 this indicates that the oscillation energy exponentially decays as @xmath101 , and the ratio of the exponential damping time @xmath102 to the oscillation period @xmath82 is equal to @xmath103 . a typical oscillation curve in the current experiment conditions is schematically shown in the right side of fig.[fig : damping ]",
    ", one can see that the oscillation amplitude will decay rapidly within one period , and this is qualitatively coincident with the experimental observation@xcite@xcite . however , there are also a little quantitatively disagreement between the theoretical damping curve and the experiments , in ref.@xcite the amplitude vanishes within about three periods and in ref.@xcite it is about one and a half periods .",
    "this disagreement occurs because in the real case the vortex mass should be modified due to the spatial density inhomogeneity , the third spatial dimension effect and the edge effect .",
    "the mass of vortex , which is proportional to the self - energy , is therefore changed with the position of vortex.@xcite it is expected that the damping curve will agree better with the experiments when these subtle effects are carefully considered .",
    "according to the effective maxwell electrodynamic model the vortices in the bec can be viewed as an ensemble of classical charges moving in an external magnetic field .",
    "so far we have applied this description to understand the observed phenomena of vortices induced by selective removal atoms from a fast rotating bec .",
    "the atom removal laser applied to the center of the condensate will cause two leading effects in the view of dual picture .",
    "one is the increase of the vortex chemical potential and then subsequently the increase of vortex density .",
    "the other is that it will induce a circular electric field , and each vortex will acquire an azimuthal velocity .",
    "we clarified that there are two forces that can cause oscillation motion , and discussed the the relation between the oscillation frequencies and the number of atoms together with the effective rotation frequency .",
    "we showed that the dispersion mechanism for the vortices oscillation comes from the emission of phonon , which is the same as the radiation of the electromagnetic wave of an accelerated charge .",
    "and the damping effect is more remarkable in these experiments because the interaction strength is weak .    in this paper",
    "the dual description of vortices has been used to explain current experiments .",
    "although it is not yet a detailed quantitative description , it provides a natural physics picture of most key experimental observations , which convinces us to believe that this description is valid to the extent that the bec is fast rotated but still not entering the quantum hall mean field regime .",
    "we hope this will start a new route to study the issues in the rapidly rotating bec system .",
