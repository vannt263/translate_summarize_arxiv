    "we consider a quantum network which constitutes a periodic two - dimensional lattice , see fig .",

    "suppose we need to transmit some qubits from alice at node @xmath3 in the network to bob at node @xmath4 .",
    "we follow the standard protocol : first , we convert each entangled state represented by a bond to a maximally entangled state .",
    "the optimal conversion probability is @xmath5 , @xcite .",
    "the quantum network then is mapped to a classical network with each bond appearing probability @xmath6 , see ref . @xcite and fig .",
    "[ eqc ] ( a ) . secondly ,",
    "if the bonds of maximally entangled states can form a path connecting @xmath3 and @xmath4 , by entanglement swapping ( entanglement repeating ) , a maximally entangled state can be generated , which constitutes a quantum channel , between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "then alice can teleport a qubit to bob .",
    "the entanglement percolation describes well whether this protocol can succeed or not @xcite .",
    "however , different from classical case , the quantum channel can only be used once . after a qubit is teleported through a quantum channel ,",
    "the resource of entanglement is consumed .",
    "the bonds no longer carry the entanglement .",
    "so the number of eqc of a quantum network is a key quantity in describing the efficiency of quantum communication , see fig .",
    "[ eqc ] .",
    "we define the eqc as , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the expectation number of quantum channels connecting @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and @xmath9 which is actually the number of bonds connecting each node in one to one communication and thus is fixed for a lattice . by definition , eqc increases with @xmath6 , is upper bounded by 1 , and depends on the network and the protocol used .",
    "greater eqc means higher efficiency of qubit transmission .",
    "it is generally very hard to find eqc analytically .",
    "however , as we can see below , the regular structures of lattices allow us to build a rather simple model which can approximate eqc well .     after the singlet conversion . *",

    "the three quantum connections between alice and bob ( green points ) are highlighted in red ( also 1 , 2 and 3 ) . * ( d ) * the attractive circles in the network .",
    "each circle has 4 ` internal bonds ' .",
    "outside the effective circles the network can be regarded simply as an isotropic ` medium ' .",
    "so , whether a quantum channel can be formed or not mostly depends on how many ` internal bond ' is formed.,width=317 ]",
    "now , we consider a quantum network with square lattice configuration .",
    "we remark that our method is general and applicable for various quantum networks .",
    "we also assume that @xmath12 , which is clear above the percolation threshold of square lattices , @xmath13 .",
    "when @xmath6 is near the critical point , the quantum state transferring efficiency can be reasonably assumed to be low .",
    "the effective approximation method may not be applicable , so we will not discuss this situation .",
    "s. since the attractive radii pertain to relative change of eqc , we depict the relative eqc in which all eqc of @xmath14 are normalized as 1 . for the original image ,",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "the corresponding @xmath15s for @xmath16 are 1.2 , 1.7 , 10.6 , 10.9 , with @xmath17 .",

    "see @xcite for details .",
    "the corresponding @xmath15s for @xmath16 are 0.64 , 1.04 , 1.59 , 2.37 , with @xmath20.,width=328 ]    let alice and bob be on two lattice nodes with distance @xmath21 , which is defined as the linear distance and the distance of two nearest neighboring sites is assumed to be 1 .",
    "now alice would like to send some qubits to bob via the network .",
    "monte carlo estimations ( fig .",
    "[ mc ] ) shows that when @xmath12 , eqc between alice and bob decreases and converges quickly to its asymptotic value when @xmath21 increases .",
    "this fast convergence suggests us to define the attractive radius of an effective circle ,    the eqc can be fitted by an exponential function , @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 are parameters depending on @xmath6 .",
    "we then can relate the attractive radius with an exponent parameter , @xmath25 .",
    "when @xmath26 , i.e. the attractive circles are not overlap , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ fitfunc ] ) can be neglected since it is less than @xmath27 as we generally used physically .",
    "thus , we know that @xmath23 represents @xmath28 asymptotically when distance @xmath21 is large , this is what we are interested",
    ". we will present an estimation of @xmath23 below .",
    "this formula agrees well with numerical results , see fig.[mc ] . for @xmath12",
    ", we have a rough estimation for the attractive radius , @xmath29 .",
    "this means that the effective circle of alice or bob includes only their nearest neighboring sites on a square lattice .",
    "the physical interpretation of @xmath30 can be understood as the radius of an effective circle . when the distance of @xmath3 and @xmath4 is larger than @xmath31 , the eqc will be approximated being independent of their distance , @xmath32 which is a fixed value for a lattice .",
    "it seems like that the two nodes are connected by first connecting from their positions to the borders of their effective circle , and second the two circles are connected through the isotropic medium .",
    "this result is significant since it means that the number of qubits capable transmitted through a quantum network does not decrease with the increase of the distance .",
    "it avoids the usual exponential decaying probability for long - distance quantum communication .",
    "our result is also consistent with the conclusion that quantum percolation in quantum networks can succeed when @xmath6 is larger than a threshold .",
    "the eqc further quantifies the number of quantum channels available in a quantum network .",
    "when @xmath3 and @xmath4 are located near , it is possible that more quantum channels can be constructed",
    ". so the attraction will be beneficial which stimulates the name ` attractive radius ' .",
    "next , we consider a different scheme for quantum communication in quantum networks .",
    "the scheme is that alice and bob at different nodes would like to send qubits to someone at positions of infinity in the network .",
    "here we only concern about how many qubits can be sent out by alice and bob .",
    "a simple consideration is that if alice and bob are located near in the quantum network , their ability of sending out qubits will be influenced by each other .",
    "the problem is in what distance they can send out qubits independently .",
    "we name the radius of this circle as the repulsive radius .",
    "monte carlo estimations ( fig .",
    "[ mc ] ) show that when @xmath12 , eqc for alice and bob together to transfer states to someone at infinity increases and converges quickly to its asymptotic value when @xmath21 increases , similar as the case of the attractive circles .",
    "also , we fit the monte carlo data to an exponential function like eq .",
    "( [ fitfunc ] ) .",
    "we find that eqc of this type is also described well by an exponential function ( fig .",
    "[ mc ] ) , @xmath33 where @xmath34 are parameters similar to those in previous consideration of attractive radii .",
    "also we define the repulsive radius as , @xmath35 .",
    "we emphasize that the eqc here means that alice and bob both send qubits to infinity . for @xmath12 , we have a rough estimation , @xmath36 .",
    "it means that when distance of alice and bob is larger than @xmath37 , they can be considered independent in sending out qubits .",
    "the repulsive radius @xmath38 also has a clear physical interpretation .",
    "it describes the range of the bonds that have a significant influence to the quantum channels connecting a and b to infinity . for small @xmath21 , the paths which connect @xmath3 and @xmath4 with positions of infinity used to build the quantum channels will conflict with each other , which will decrease the number of quantum channels resulting in a smaller eqc .    the key feature of the eqc as a function of distance is its rapid convergence to a stationary value .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this is a universal feature for various lattices .",
    "now we can easily approximate eqc analytically by using the physical meanings of @xmath30 and @xmath38 .",
    "suppose alice needs to transmit qubits to bob .",
    "two situations are considered : ( i ) point - to - point quantum communication , alice and bob both can access only one node in the network ; ( ii ) multipartite - to - multipartite quantum communication , they each can access @xmath39 nodes . here",
    "we assume that each node is independent from other nodes .",
    "that is , any pair distance of those @xmath39 nodes possessed by alice ( bob ) is larger than 2@xmath38 . and alice s group nodes are far from bob s group nodes . within this situation ,",
    "our approach gives @xmath23 in eq .",

    "henceforth , all eqc we mentioned here are @xmath23 since distance is supposed large .     of triangle lattice(the proportion of nodes in the largest connected nodes ) @xcite",
    ". we may observe that @xmath40 ( red linep ) corresponding to entanglement percolation is like a ` jump function ' demonstrating only success or failure , while the behavior of the proposed eqc is different , it in general increases monotonically with @xmath6 and approaches 1 finally when @xmath6 takes the limit of 1 . because the exact expression of @xmath40 is an infinite series and we picks first 30 terms here , the zero point of the curve is slightly different from the exact percolation threshold @xmath41 @xcite . but the ` jump function ' property is maintained . *",
    "( b ) * lines with different symbols represent monte carlo estimation of eqc of square , triangle and hexagon lattices .",
    "red lines are fitted curves according to eq .",
    "p([fitform ] ) , with corresponding lattice indices @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44.,width=332 ]    here we still consider the case of square lattice firstly . for the first situation ( i ) ,",
    "when @xmath12 which means @xmath45 , the effective circle contains only 5 nodes , 4 internal bonds and 12 peripheral bonds connecting to the outside of the circle . when alice and bob are far away from each other , the quantum channels between @xmath3 and @xmath4 depend mostly on number of maximally entangled states induced by those 4 internal bonds for alice or bob",
    ". only pairs of internal bonds belonging respectively to two sides can possibly form independent quantum channels .",
    "the number of established pairs is denoted by @xmath46 which is a random number .",
    "thus the expectation of the number of pairs is ,    @xmath47    we remark that when @xmath48 is omitted , the above equation equals to @xmath49 . when @xmath50 , the medium can be seen as fully connected , and we have an asymptotic limit , @xmath51 .    for general @xmath12 ,",
    "notice that for a connected neighboring point of @xmath3 , the probability that at least one peripheral bond is connected to the outside is @xmath52 . under this consideration ,",
    "the probability that the quantum connection does not meet a dead end in the ` medium ' can be written as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is like an index of the medium depending only on lattice which can be fitted by numerical data . in this way",
    ", an estimated eqc can be written as follows , @xmath55 we can find that this formula agrees well with the data , see fig .",
    "[ fit ] . the fig .",
    "[ fit](a ) also shows difference between entanglement percolation and eqc .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the eqc also experienced a phase transition at the percolation threshold .",

    "the same reasoning can be applied , the eq.([exppairs ] ) can be generalized as , @xmath62 then we immediately have , @xmath63 the validity of this formula can be confirmed similarly as eq .",
    "( [ fitform ] ) , and it agrees well with numerical results .",
    "we remark that here we assume @xmath6 is far from the critical point .",
    "higher order of correction terms become significant and thus not negligible when the considered @xmath6 gets closer to the critical point .",
    "actually the number of correction terms tend to infinity in eq .",

    "( 7 ) when the estimation is carried out at the critical point of the network .    for comparison between eq .",
    "( [ kfit ] ) and monte carlo approach , see @xcite for figures .",
    "data shows that multipartite - to - multipartite quantum communication offers a higher eqc .",
    "this can be explained as that more bonds tend to be easier to be paired up , and the influence of the minimum function is weakened .",
    "another important kind of situation is that alice and bob can access different number of nodes .",
    "for example , alice can access one node while bob can access @xmath642 nodes .",
    "this resembles a ` distribution ' scenario .",
    "results show that eqc is very close to @xmath6 and is almost constant when @xmath65 .",
    "this can be explained similar to the previous case by noting that the four bonds within the attractive effective circle of alice can almost always be paired in this case , see @xcite for figures .",
    "lattice transformation by entanglement swapping at some nodes can enhance entanglement percolation properties @xcite .",
    "this is done by altering the lattice structure by carrying out first at some nodes the optimal entanglement swapping protocol and correspondingly changing the percolation threshold of the network . in this section",
    "we focus on the eqc of the networks undertaking various transformations and study whether the lattice transformations can increase or decrease the communication efficiency . for lattice transformation ,",
    "we need to modify the definition of eqc as @xmath66 where @xmath67 refers to the expectation number of quantum channels connecting @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the new network , and @xmath68 is that of the old network with @xmath69 , regarded as fixed initial entanglement resources .",
    "( if two or more bonds are connecting two neighboring nodes , consider the bond - separated situations ) .",
    "this modification takes lattice transformation effects into account , and the eqc can be compared to the previously defined one to evaluate the effect of the transformations .        by using monte carlo methods ,",
    "we observe two typical situations when lattice transformations may be beneficial .",
    "when the entanglement percolation have different thresholds for the corresponding lattices , however , the eqc curves may demonstrate two behaviors , * ( i ) * intersecting or * ( ii ) * non - intersecting . for the * ( i ) * non - intersecting case , lattice transformation can enhance the efficiency for all @xmath6 above the percolation threshold .",
    "in contrast for the * ( ii ) * intersecting case , the lattice transformation induced by entanglement swapping is beneficial in some regions while in other regions is not , i.e. the eqc may decrease after lattice transformation . in the following ,",
    "we consider two lattice transformations as examples .",
    "_ double - bond hexagonal lattice._ we know that a double - bond hexagonal lattice with @xmath6 slightly less than its percolation threshold @xmath70 can be transformed into a single - bond triangular lattice with @xmath71 greater than its percolation threshold @xmath72 via entanglement swapping @xcite .",
    "our approach by estimating eqc reveals that there is an intersection between two eqc curves .",
    "the corresponding @xmath6 of the intersection can be estimated by rewriting eq.([fitform ] ) for triangle and hexagonal lattices @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "we can substitute @xmath75 and @xmath76 into those equations .",
    "it is apparently that @xmath77 , while applying eq .",
    "( [ fitform ] ) to triangle lattice , we find @xmath78 , which demonstrates an intersection in the curves of eqc ( see fig . [ latticetransform ] ) .",
    "we also notice that for a network with more bonds connecting with one node , its eqc is closer to eq.(5 ) .",
    "monte carlo estimations confirm the intersection .",
    "our approach provides an explicit illustration for this lattice transformation : for @xmath79 , lattice transformation is beneficial not only for a lower critical point in entanglement percolation but a higher efficiency shown by eqc as well . but for @xmath80 , transformation will decrease the quantum communication efficiency represented by eqc .",
    "another lattice transformation involves separating double bonds and turns the network into two identical single - bond networks .",
    "this strategy can be applied for around @xmath81 by considering the eqc ( fig .",
    "[ latticetransform ] ) , in which two separately - used bonds can give a higher @xmath6 .",
