    "in a prescient paper , @xcite suggests that a stellar binary interaction with the milky way s central black hole could eject one member of the binary with a velocity @xmath6 km s@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite further develop hill s analysis and suggest two additional mechanisms to eject `` hyper - velocity '' stars from the galactic center : close encounters of two single stars and three - body interactions between a single star and a binary black hole .",
    "@xcite predict production rates for all three mechanisms .",
    "even the discovery of a single hyper - velocity star can place important constraints on the formation mechanism and the nature of the galactic center .    in our survey of faint blue horizontal branch candidates in the galactic halo",
    ", we have discovered a star , sdss j090745.0 + 024507 , traveling with a heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath0 km s@xmath1 .",
    "corrected to the local standard of rest and for the solar reflex motion , the galactic rest frame velocity of this star is @xmath7 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the observed radial velocity is only a _ lower _ limit to the star s true space velocity , but the radial velocity alone substantially exceeds the escape velocity from the galaxy .",
    "the distance to the hyper - velocity star ( hereafter hvs ) is @xmath2 55 kpc . at a galacto - centric distance of 50 kpc ,",
    "the mass of the milky way is 5.4@xmath8 m@xmath9 @xcite and the escape velocity is 305 km s@xmath1 .",
    "thus the hvs is moving well over _ twice _ the escape velocity and in a direction 173.8@xmath4 from the galactic center .    by comparison , traditional `` high - velocity '' and `` run - away '' stars",
    "are stars with peculiar velocities greater than 30 km s@xmath1 .",
    "high - velocity stars are typically early - type stars in the galactic disk moving away from star formation regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "run - away b - type stars have been observed up to @xmath215 kpc above the galactic plane and moving with radial velocities up to @xmath10 km s@xmath1 @xcite . the highest velocity halo star , to our knowledge ,",
    "was observed by @xcite moving through the solar neighborhood with a total galactic rest frame velocity of 490 km s@xmath1 . in all cases , these high velocity and run - away stars",
    "are very probably bound to the galaxy .    in  2",
    "we describe the target selection and the spectroscopic observations of the blue horizontal branch candidate sample .",
    "the hvs is a 6@xmath11 outlier from the distribution of radial velocities of this sample . in ",
    "3 we demonstrate the robustness of the radial velocity and discuss the hvs s stellar properties . in ",
    "4 we discuss the significance of the star s hyper - velocity .",
    "we have been using blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars to trace velocity structure in the milky way halo @xcite . in 2003 , as part of an effort to measure the dynamical mass of the milky way more accurately , we used sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) early data release and data release 1 photometry to select faint @xmath12 bhb candidates for spectroscopic observations .",
    "we identified bhb candidates by their a - type colors following @xcite : @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "figure [ fig : ugr ] shows this color selection box , and colors of the 36 observed bhb candidates .",
    "the density of bhb candidates in this color / magnitude range is 0.3 objects deg@xmath15 .",
    "our observational strategy was to observe objects well - placed in the sky at the time of observation .",
    "thus our sample of 36 stars is `` randomly '' selected from the area covered by the sdss early data release and data release 1 .",
    "we obtained spectra of the 36 bhb candidates with the 6.5 m mmt telescope during april , july , and december 2003 .",
    "we used the mmt blue channel spectrograph with a 832 line / mm grating in second order .",
    "this set - up provides 1.0   spectral resolution using a 1 arcsec slit . with a dispersion of 0.36  /",
    "pix on the 2688@xmath16512 ccd ,           our spectral coverage is 950  .",
    "all observations were made at the parallactic angle .",
    "on nights of good seeing @xmath17 arcsec , we obtained @xmath18 at 4,000   in one hour of integration .",
    "the 36 bhb / a stars are all located in the galactic halo with heliocentric distances ranging @xmath19 kpc .",
    "we measure heliocentric radial velocities using the cross - correlation package rvsao @xcite .",
    "we correct the velocities to the local standard of rest @xcite .",
    "we assume the stellar halo has no mean rotation , and correct the velocities for the reflex motion of the local 220 km s@xmath1 orbital motion .",
    "figure [ fig : veldisp ] plots a histogram of the radial velocities in the galactic rest frame for all 36 bhb / a stars . ignoring the hvs",
    ", the sample has a velocity dispersion of @xmath20 km s@xmath1 consistent with a halo population .",
    "the mean velocity of the sample ( ignoring the hvs ) is @xmath21 km s@xmath1 , consistent with our assumption of no rotation .",
    "the @xmath22 kms@xmath1 hvs , sdss 090745.0 + 024507 , is a @xmath23 outlier from the observed distribution of radial velocities .",
    "the hvs is located at @xmath24 @xmath25 ( j2000 ) . in galactic coordinates ,",

    "the spectrum represents 60 minutes of integration time , and has s / n=20 at 4,000  .",
    "the spectrum shows a raw heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath0 km s@xmath1 .",
    "corrected to the local standard of rest , the galactic velocity components are @xmath27 km s@xmath1 ( radially outwards ) , @xmath28 km s@xmath1 ( opposite the galactic rotation direction ) , and @xmath29 km s@xmath1 ( vertically upwards ) .",
    "the substantial radial velocity is evident even from inspection of the two - dimensional spectra .",
    "figure [ fig : twod ] shows the @xmath30 line of the hvs shifted nearly on top of the night sky line at 4358.34  .",
    "moreover , the spectrum in fig [ fig : spectrum ] is not based on a single observation , but on a series of three 20 minute observations obtained over 1 hour .",
    "the wavelength solution for the three observations is nearly identical to the wavelength solutions obtained throughout the rest of that night .",
    "we verify the wavelength solution by measuring the velocity of the night sky lines . the hg line at 4358.34   ( see fig [ fig : twod ] ) has the best s / n and a @xmath31 km s@xmath1 velocity consistent with zero .",
    "we conclude that the wavelength solution is robust .",
    "we measure radial velocities for the three individual observations and find that the velocities agree to @xmath32 km s@xmath1 .",
    "moreover , we measure radial velocities using three different stellar templates ( for b7 , b9 , and a1 spectral types ) and find that the velocities agree to @xmath33 km s@xmath1 .",
    "we conclude the radial velocity is accurate .",
    "if the hvs were a close binary , any systematic velocity offset is likely to be small fraction of the observed velocity .",
    "the hvs has de - reddened colors @xmath34 and @xmath35 , marked by the solid triangle in fig [ fig : ugr ] .",
    "these colors indicate it is probably a hot bhb star or a late b - type main sequence star .",
    "its apparent magnitude is @xmath36 .",
    "we classify the hvs s spectral type as b9.2 with an uncertainty of 1.2 spectral sub - types .",
    "this classification is based on line indices described in @xcite .",
    "the spectral type is in perfect agreement with the star s estimated effective temperature , @xmath37 k ( r.  wilhelm 2004 , private communication ) .",
    "we measure the hvs s metallicity based on the equiv-           alent width of the caii k line and the star s photometric colors . however , the caii k line provides little leverage on [ fe / h ] at high @xmath38 .",
    "thus there is considerable uncertainty in [ fe / h ] . interpolated tables @xcite",
    "show that [ fe / h ] can range from -0.4 to well over 0.0 ; we conclude that the star s metallicity is roughly solar [ fe / h]@xmath20.0 .",
    "solar metallicity suggests the hvs is probably a b9 main sequence star .",
    "however , given the uncertainty we can not rule out the star being a hot bhb star .",
    "we estimate the hvs s surface gravity by measuring the size and steepness of its balmer jump @xcite , and the widths and the shapes of its balmer lines @xcite .",
    "these independent techniques indicate that the star is a low surface gravity bhb star . however , classification by surface gravity is ambiguous at this @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath38 and @xmath39 of the horizontal branch crosses the main sequence around @xmath210,000 k. thus we can not reliably distinguish between a hot bhb or a b9 main sequence star based on its surface gravity .",
    "this uncertainty is problematic for estimating the star s distance : a hot bhb star and a b9 main sequence star with the same @xmath38 and @xmath39 differ in luminosity by a factor of @xmath24 .",
    "we estimate the hvs s distance first assuming it is a hot bhb star .",
    "we calculate luminosity using the @xmath40 relation of @xcite , which combines the @xcite _",
    "hipparcos_-derived @xmath41 zero point , the @xcite lmc - derived @xmath41-metallicity slope , and the @xcite @xmath41-temperature correction . if it is a hot bhb star , the hvs has @xmath42 and a heliocentric distance @xmath43 kpc .",
    "hot bhb stars are intrinsically less - luminous stars that hook down off the classical horizontal branch .",
    "we thus consider 39 kpc as a lower limit for the hvs s distance .",
    "we next estimate the hvs s distance assuming it is a b9 main sequence star . to estimate the luminosity of a b9 star we look at the @xcite stellar evolution tracks for a 3 @xmath44 star with @xmath45 .",
    "such a star spends @xmath46 yrs on the main sequence and produces 160 @xmath47 when it has @xmath48 k. we convert this luminosity to absolute magnitude using the bolometric corrections of @xcite .",
    "if it is a b9 main sequence star , the hvs has @xmath49 and a heliocentric distance of @xmath50 kpc .    for purposes of discussion , we assume the hvs has the average distance of these two estimates : @xmath51 kpc .",
    "this estimate places the star at @xmath52 = @xmath53 kpc above the galactic disk , and at @xmath54 = @xmath55 kpc from the           galactic center .",
    "remarkably , @xcite predicted the existence of hyper - velocity stars as a consequence of the presence of a massive black hole at the galactic center .",
    "other mechanisms fail to produce velocities as large as the one we observe for the hvs . for example",
    ", the star is not associated with the sgr stream , nor is its radial velocity consistent with any other member of the local group .",
    "association with high velocity clouds is unlikely given their low velocity dispersion @xmath20 km s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the hvs is also unlikely to be in the tail of the galactic halo velocity distribution : our target selection yields 10@xmath56 stars over the entire sky , and we should have to observe 10@xmath57 objects to find one 6@xmath11 outlier .",
    "supernova ejection @xcite and dynamical ejection @xcite are mechanisms thought to produce run - away b stars , but both mechanisms predict maximum ejection velocities of @xmath2300 km s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "@xcite predicts that tightly bound stellar binaries encountering the central black hole can eject one star with velocity @xmath58 km s@xmath1 from the galactic center . @xcite",
    "also predict that the close encounter of two single stars or the three - body interaction between a single star and a binary black hole can result in similar ejection velocities from the galactic center .",
    "@xcite show that the production rates for these mechanisms are : ( 1 ) 10@xmath59 yr@xmath1 for single star encounters , ( 2 ) 10@xmath60 yr@xmath1 for binary star encounters with the central black hole , and ( 3 ) 10@xmath61 yr@xmath1 for single star encounters with a binary black hole .",
    "thus the very existence of the hvs rules out the single star encounter mechanism .",
    "recent measurements of stellar orbits around the galactic center provide overwhelming evidence of a @xmath62 m@xmath9 black hole at the galactic center @xcite .",
    "although it is difficult to imagine a b star forming near the central black hole , many young , massive stars _ are _ observed within 1 pc of the galactic center ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , one of the stars used to measure the mass of the bh has a @xmath63 au periapse and an orbital eccentricity @xmath64 , giving it a periapse velocity @xmath65 km s@xmath1 @xcite .    the radial velocity vector of the hvs points 173.8@xmath4 from the galactic center , suggestive of a galactic center origin .",
    "even assuming that the observed radial velocity is the full space motion of the hvs , the travel time from the galactic center is @xmath580 myr .",
    "the lifetime of a b9 main sequence star , by comparison , is approximately 350 myr ; the age of a star on the horizontal branch is much longer .",
    "thus the star s solar metallicity , its direction of travel , and its travel time are all consistent with a galactic center origin .",
    "if the hvs is traveling on a radial path from the galactic center , we predict its proper motion is @xmath66 mas yr@xmath1 .",
    "the usnob1 @xcite and the gsc2.3.1 ( b.  mclean , 2005 private communication ) catalogs list the star with a proper motion of @xmath67 and @xmath68 mas yr@xmath1 , respectively , but in nearly opposite directions .",
    "the average of these proper motions is @xmath69 mas yr@xmath1 consistent with zero .",
    "we searched for the star on 50 to 100 year - old plates in the harvard plate archive to increase the observed time baseline , but the hvs was too faint .",
    "the _ gaia _",
    "mission should be able to observe 20 mag stars with 0.16 mas yr@xmath1 accuracy @xcite and thus may determine the full space motion of the hvs .",
    "we can use our sample to place an upper limit on the production rate of hyper - velocity stars .",
    "our sample of 36 bhb / a stars fills an effective volume of @xmath210@xmath70 kpc@xmath70 indicating an upper limit on the density of hyper - velocity bhb / a stars , @xmath210@xmath15 kpc@xmath71 . if it takes 10@xmath72 yr for a hyper - velocity star to leave the galaxy , the @xcite production rates imply a total of 10@xmath70 - 10@xmath56 hyper - velocity stars within the halo , a density of 10@xmath71 - 10@xmath15 kpc@xmath71 . at first glance",
    "there appears to be rough agreement between the observed and predicted density of hyper - velocity stars .",
    "however , bhb / a stars represent only a small fraction of the total population of halo stars , and there are essentially no constraints on the fraction of the binary population they might represent near the galactic center .",
    "the discovery of a hvs , as predicted by @xcite and @xcite , provides an interesting piece of new evidence for a massive black hole at the galactic center .",
    "ironically , this evidence comes from the radial velocity of a star @xmath260 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "we are now using the mmt hectospec spectrograph , a 300 fiber spectrograph with a 1@xmath4 diameter field of view @xcite , to observe additional @xmath73 bhb candidates over wide areas of sky .",
    "the identification of more hyper - velocity stars as a function of distance and position on the sky will place better constraints on the production mechanism and production rate of these unusual stars .",
    "observing hyper - velocity stars over a wide range of distances will allow us to measure the production history at the galactic center and could probe the history of the formation of the central black hole .",
