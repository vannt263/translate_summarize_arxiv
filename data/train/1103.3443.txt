    "the current development of nanomaterials for molecular electronics has triggerd the study of heat conduction in low - dimensional systems from new perspectives .",
    "it is well known that the derivation of the thermal properties in one and two dimensional systems is a controversial topic which has been deeply studied in the last two decades .",
    "@xcite in the case of perfect harmonic lattices , the lack of phonon - phonon interactions leads to no thermal resistivity , which gives rise to an infinite thermal conductivity in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this means , fourier s law is not valid in these systems and heat conduction exhibits anomalous behavior .",
    "nonintegrability and an external substrate potential constitute the sufficient conditions to completely change this scenario .",
    "@xcite in such a case , the conservation law of total momentum is violated and fourier s law reveals as valid .",
    "recently , the most studied proposals are the frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) ,  @xcite and the @xmath0 potentials .",
    "@xcite several authors have revisited the unusual thermal properties of one dimensional systems in order to propose different applications such as thermal rectifiers or thermal transistors .",
    "@xcite some of these studies have been extended to two and three dimensional structures  @xcite and complex networks  @xcite , where it has been addressed the relevant influence of the coupling among several one dimensional lattices .",
    "more interestingly , the analysis of the mechanisms mediating energy flow in low dimensional biomolecules is a fundamental issue for the understanding of many biologically relevant functions .",
    "the electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom of biomolecular systems , specially those containing helix structures , i.e. double - helix dna or @xmath1-helices in proteins , can be modeled as ladder structures of coupled one - dimensional lattices .",
    "@xcite recently , the thermal conductivity of double - stranded molecules has been studied in ref .   where the interchain interaction between two identical chains has revealed as a positive or negative effect on heat conduction , depending on the strength of the nonlinearity present in the system .",
    "in this paper we address some interesting issues about heat transport along double - stranded molecular systems which remain open .",
    "in particular , we consider a ladder - model where two different lattices , a harmonic and an anharmonic one , are coupled by harmonic forces . in view of the clearly different thermal properties of these two subsystems when they are isolated , our work analyzes how the coupled system behavior is affected depending on the coupling strength .",
    "in addition , due to the asymmetry present in the system , we address the possibility of heat rectification .",
    "in this section we will present the theoretical formalism we will be dealing with in our study on heat transport along double - stranded molecules . in particular , we consider a system conformed by a harmonic one dimensional lattice which is coupled by harmonic forces to an anharmonic one .",
    "the dimensionless hamiltonian of such a system is written as follows : @xmath2    @xmath3 and @xmath4 describe the dynamics of the subchains , the harmonic ( h ) and the anharmonic ( a ) one respectively , each one consisting of @xmath5 sites .",
    "both are affected by a harmonic potential @xmath6 and chain ( a ) is considered within the frenkel - kontorova model .",
    "thus , chain ( a ) is affected by an on - site potential @xmath7 , whose strength is defined by @xmath8 . for the sake of simplicity , we will consider the same elastic constant for both chains , @xmath9 , in terms of which the harmonic interchain coupling @xmath10 is expressed .",
    "the latter interaction is considered within the hamiltonian @xmath11 , whose characteristic oscillator frequency is @xmath12 . notice that hereafter the period of the external potential , @xmath13 , is taken as the length scale of the system and the magnitude @xmath14 will be the energy unit .  @xcite    fig .",
    "[ sketch ] presents a schematic view of the system under study .     and @xmath15 respectively.,width=264 ]",
    "our aim is to study the formation of a thermal gradient along this double - stranded structure by connecting two independent heat reservoirs at both ends of the harmonic lattice .",
    "heat baths effects will be included in the dynamics of the edge sites of the system , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , by using stochastic langevin equations .",
    "@xcite this will modify the newton s equations of motion of the affected sites , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , as follows : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the coupling between the system and the stochastic bath and the prime indicates derivative with respect to @xmath22 . random forces , which include temperature effects , are defined as : @xmath23    the relationship between this dimensionless temperature @xmath24 and the real one @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 refers to the boltzmann constant .",
    "@xcite the temperature of the baths @xmath24 will be different for the left cold ( @xmath28 ) and right hot ( @xmath15 ) sides of the chain .    exploiting the equations of motion ,",
    "the local heat flux is defined by the continuity equation as : @xmath29    molecular dynamics simulations are performed by the numerical method proposed by greenside and helfand as a correction to the runge - kutta method for stochastic equations ( 3o4s2 g ) ,  @xcite by considering a long enough integration time such that the stationary state is established .",
    "the time step is @xmath30 and the friction constant of the baths is set to @xmath31 in all simulations . in the final state the time averaged",
    "heat flux reaches a constant value along the system such that @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the thermal conductivity for a finite system can be calculated as @xmath33 .",
    "notice that @xmath34 will be size - independent in the case of normal heat transport .",
    "similarly , in the steady state the time averaged temperature calculated as @xmath35 will reach the stationary thermal profile .",
    "to better understand the influence of the coupling to nonlinear degrees of freedom , first we would like to perform a preliminary study of a single frenkel - kontorova chain connected to two independent heat reservoirs at temperatures @xmath36 and right @xmath37 at the left and right edges of the chain .",

    "we have performed molecular dynamics simulations for different values of @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",

    "[ singleu8](a ) demonstrates on the other hand that @xmath40 has to be high enough to be able to activate the vibrational states of the anharmonic band .",

    "figure  [ singleu8 ] shows from top to bottom that the anharmonicity shifts the dos to lower frequencies when @xmath58 is increased , as predicted by the scpt approach .",
    "however , it is well known that the scpt approximation is not able to predict the broadening of the frequency band when thermal effects become more relevant at higher temperatures , see fig .  [ singleu8](c ) . in view of these arguments",
    ", we want to stress two conclusions which will be taken into account hereafter . on one hand",
    "it is clear that @xmath58 in the system should be high enough to activate the anharmonic modes in order to create a well formed thermal gradient along the lattice in presence of the thermal baths .",
    "however , in order to have an accurate description of the thermal properties based on the scpt , @xmath58 should be low enough so that thermal effects are kept within this approach validity .",
    "for the sake of clarity we will focus on temperature regimes which fulfilled these two requirements hereafter .",
    "now that we have reviewed some of the characteristics of an anharmonic one dimensional lattice , we focus on the main system of interest in this work , the ladder - model presented in fig",
