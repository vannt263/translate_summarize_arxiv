    "however , since the temperature and excitation dependence of the relaxation dynamics in a kondo insulator smb@xmath7 is nearly identical to that of heavy fermion systems,@xcite it was naturally to assume that the origin of the bottleneck in the entire class of materials was in the presence of the indirect hybridization gap.@xcite    in this paper we report first systematic studies of photoexcited carrier relaxation dynamics in an intermediate - valence system yb@xmath0lu@xmath1al@xmath2 . in yb@xmath0lu@xmath1al@xmath2 concentration of local f moments can be continuously varied between 1 ( ybal@xmath2 is a heavy fermion with the kondo temperature of 600 - 700 k ) and 0 by replacing yb with open f - shell with lu with closed f - shell ( lual@xmath2 is a normal metal ) .",

    "the slowing down of relaxation is truncated and the relaxation rate becomes constant below @xmath10 .",

    "the fact that relaxation dynamics in this low perturbation experiment is found to be independent of excitation intensity effectively rules out this interpretation.@xcite alternatively , we can assume ( quite generally ) , that the relaxation of the excited state proceeds via two independent channels .",
    "in the case of two competing relaxation processes the recovery dynamics will always be governed by the fastest of the two .",
    "if one of the processes is slow and temperature independent , while the other shows strong temperature dependence , becoming slower and slower as the temperature is reduced , one would expect to observe a crossover from the temperature dependent to a temperature independent relaxation at the temperature where the two timescales become comparable .",
    "clearly , this scenario is consistent with the experimentally observed temperature dependence of the relaxation time .",
    "while at temperatures above @xmath10 the temperature dependence of both amplitude and relaxation time are in very good agreement with the relaxation bottleneck model - see fig .",
    "( 2 ) , where the bottleneck in relaxation is a result of the presence of the hybridization gap near the fermi level , the question arises which temperature independent relaxation process could lead to the observed crossover into t - independent relaxation below @xmath10 ?",

    "5 ) it follows that @xmath66 up to @xmath23 k , well into experimentally accessible @xmath5 range .",
    "hence one can expect that in addition to the recombination process with characteristic time @xmath22 a ballistic transport of hot electrons @xcite will take place on a timescale of @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the fermi velocity . from the dhva data @xcite one obtains @xmath69 @xmath70 ( @xmath71 @xmath72 )",

    "in fact , the fit is mainly governed by the @xmath67 ratio ( best fit gives @xmath99 ps in good agreement with the above estimate ) while @xmath100 can be anywhere between 5 - 100 ps .",
    "the situation is reversed at @xmath101 , where the fit is entirely governed by @xmath100 . since the mean free path quickly decreases below @xmath12 upon increasing t , e.g. in ybal@xmath2",
