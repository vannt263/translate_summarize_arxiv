    "group theory , as an instrument to explore the underlying structure of mathematical models describing the physical world , brings a layer of abstraction into physics that allows deeper insight . as such",

    "it is useful to decompose it into a unit matrix part and a traceless part , @xmath13 the traceless part can be written in terms of the special unitary group @xmath0 which is a household name in physics often related to the work of gell - mann @xcite and neeman @xcite , @xmath14 here , we have defined the auxiliary effective refractive index @xmath15/2 $ ] , @xmath16 , and used the following representation for the @xmath0 group @xcite , @xmath17 it is straightforward to relate matrices @xmath18 to the couplings between the first and second waveguides , matrices @xmath19 to the couplings between second and third waveguides , and matrices @xmath20 to the couplings between third and first waveguides .",

    "there is no apriori ordering of @xmath28 elements to write the propagator , however , the values of the @xmath31 functions do depend on the chosen order and different orderings have been studied in the quantum optics literature @xcite .",

    "non - linear differential equations are known to be hard to solve and finding a solution often requires intuition and knowledge of the system being analyzed . before delving into details",
    ", we would like to point out a key feature of passive , lossless optical models that we are analyzing , their mode - coupling matrices are real symmetric , @xmath40 where the operation @xmath41 stands for transposition , and , as a direct consequence , the propagator fulfills @xmath42 .",
    "this feature allows us to conclude that the propagator functions are symmetric , @xmath43 most of the time , numerical methods would be the only way to find these auxiliary functions but standard and matrix riccati equations are well known in the field of mathematical physics and control theory and we can rely on known solutions from those areas .",
    "an alternate approach can be followed if we write the propagator as a matrix , @xmath44 where , for reasons that will become apparent in a moment , we introduced a set of five auxiliary functions , @xmath45 , \\\\",

    "while we have provided a formal solution to propagation through the most general triangular waveguide coupler , considering a particular solution may help build further intuition .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , let us now consider the constant optical trimer , which is a triangular three - waveguide array with constant couplings and identical waveguides .",
    "we will introduce the dimensionless propagation parameter @xmath54 , such that the mode - coupling differential equation becomes @xmath55 with the mode - coupling matrix , @xmath56 given in terms of the dimensionless parameters , @xmath57 now , we can use the results above to build a particular solution , but it is well known that a set of linear first order differential equations is equivalent to a single linear differential equation of higher order . after some algebra , we can derive a third order differential equation for @xmath58 , @xmath59 with boundary conditions , @xmath60 note that the remaining auxiliary functions are straightforward to calculate , @xmath61    the main auxiliary function @xmath58 has the following solution , @xmath62 where the constant parameters @xmath63 are the eigenvalues of the mode - coupling matrix determined by the characteristic polynomial , a reduced cubic , @xmath64 it is straightforward to notice that there are three different real eigenvalues for real , positive , non - zero coupling parameters , @xmath65 .",
    "these proper values can be writen in a closed but non - compact form , so we will not write them explicitly . furthermore , the coefficients are given by @xmath66 thus , the propagator functions , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , will effectively contain terms involving the three eigenvalues as well as sums and differences thereof .",
    "figure [ fig : fig3 ] shows the trajectories described by the absolute value of the field amplitudes , @xmath72 , as they propagate through the constant optical trimer with random parameters and initial field distribution calculated provided by the group theory approach .      the discussion above focus on constant coupling terms , ie .",
    "terms that do not exhibit z - dependence . to unveil and demonstrate the true vigor of the wei - norman approach we will , in the remainder of this section , turn to a waveguide system with equal , z - dependent coupling terms and identical refractive indices .",
    "the effective mode coupling matrix for such a system is written as : @xmath73 the complex matrix riccati equation , eq.([eq : fstriccati ] ) , in this particular case is symmetric , suggesting that , taking initial conditions into account , the solution also is symmetric : @xmath74 where we have dropped the subscript @xmath75 for the sake of simplicity as a result of eq.([eq : symmcon ] ) . consequently , the complex matrix riccati differential equation , eq.([eq : fstriccati ] ) trims back to a single , complex riccati differential equation : @xmath76.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , the other riccati equation we need to solve , eq.([eq : sndriccati ] ) , reads , @xmath77.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in light of the symmetries , we have two remaining functions , namely @xmath48 and @xmath78 , to solve until we have a closed form complete solution that yields the propagator , eq([eq : prop ] ) .",
    "it is not difficult to see that eq.([eq : mu : min ] ) to eq.([eq : iota : min ] ) , combined , can yield functions @xmath48 and @xmath78 .",
    "it is important to note that care must be taken as the exponentials in eq.([eq : mu : min ] ) to eq.([eq : iota : min ] ) imply logarithms when solved for @xmath48 and @xmath78 .",

    "the auxiliary functions @xmath81 and @xmath82 are z - dependent , integer functions such that logarithmic discontinuities will cancel out . for the sake of completeness we state the propagator function , given that eq.([eq : symm : nuiota ] ) and eq.([eq : symmcon ] ) hold true , @xmath83",
    "as we just saw , the constant optical trimer and the propagation dependent equilateral optical trimer are simple enough to allow us the construction of a closed form solution and , to our advantage , both are experimentally feasible . now the obvious question is if there is a use for them . in the following , we will show that a judicious choice of coupling parameters provides different types of well - defined propagation of field amplitudes that can be used for the design of integrated photonic circuits .",

    "figure [ fig : fig4 ] shows the trajectories described by the absolute value of the field amplitudes , @xmath72 , as they propagate .",
    "all trajectories will lie on the surface of an octant of the sphere due to unitary propagation , @xmath8 .",
    "figure [ fig : fig4](a ) shows the response to impulse input , @xmath98 with @xmath99 and a fixed @xmath100 .",
    "figure [ fig : fig3](b ) shows the trajectories given by initial field superpositions of the more general form : @xmath101 with @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "note that the roots of the mode - coupling matrix , @xmath104 , are doubly degenerate and commesurate , @xmath105 thus , propagation involves just two commensurate eigenvalues and all the possible field amplitude propagation trajectories , @xmath106 , will be closed and well defined as those shown in fig.[fig : fig4 ] .      in the case of two equal coupling parameters",
    "the unitless mode - coupling matrix becomes , @xmath107 note that exchanging the first and second waveguides returns the same mode - coupling matrix ; in other words , it is @xmath108-invariant .",
    "this symmetry is reflected by the eigenvalues , @xmath109 with @xmath110 it is simply to see that @xmath111 and that the latter eigenvalue becomes the golden ratio for @xmath112 .",
    "again , due to the @xmath113-symmetry the propagator can be calculated directly using the group theory approach , @xmath114    obviously , when the eigenvalues are commensurate , the field amplitude propagation trajectories will be closed and well defined . however , this particular symmetry might allow further interesting states .",
    "note that the auxiliary functions @xmath58 and @xmath115 depend on only two of the three eigenfrequencies , @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "furthermore , a little bit of algebra considering an initial state without any field impinging at the zeroth waveguide , @xmath118 , reveals that propagation in the second waveguide , @xmath119 , only depends on those two auxiliary functions , @xmath58 and @xmath115 , @xmath120 now , we can hope that choosing a proper input will balance out one of the two eigenvalues that appear in the evolution of the field amplitude at the second waveguide .",
    "that is , if the evolution only depends on a single eigenvalue , it will only change in phase and the field amplitude at the second waveguide will remain immutable .",
    "this is fulfilled when @xmath121 are met as initial conditions . without loss of generality",
    ", we can give the propagated amplitude vector for the two possible initial vectors defined by @xmath116 and @xmath117 , @xmath122 up to a normalization constant @xmath123 .",

    "figure [ fig : fig6 ] shows the propagation trajectories of two random initial fields impinging at an equilateral coupler where all waveguides are getting closer together producing an effective coupling parameter that depends linearly on the propagation distance , @xmath135 .",
    "note that such an array protects the eigenstates of the initial configuration through propagation .",
    "finally , we want to show that a theoretical physics treatment of photonic lattices can go beyond the standard approach to the quantum mechanical analogy that considers an array of coupled waveguides as an array of coupled resonators , for the triangular waveguide coupler , @xmath136 where the operators @xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) annihilate ( create ) a photon in the @xmath2th resonator , and realizes that , with the single photon limit ansatz , @xmath139 with @xmath140 , it yields the same system of differential equations , @xmath141 as coupled - mode theory , eq.([eq : cmt ] ) , once we make the substitution @xmath142 . this analogy allowed us to pursuit a group theory approach in the previous sections for the propagation of the field amplitudes but it can also allow us to go further and derive equations of motion for different sets of variables .      for example , if we forget about the single - photon limit and take the classical limit , where the states of light can be taken as coherent states with a high number of photons , then , the canonical pair provided by the creation and annihilation operators can be replaced by the canonical pair of classical intensity , @xmath143 , and phase , @xmath144 , such that @xmath145 . as a result , we obtain a classical hamiltonian , @xmath146 that provides us with the following equations of motion for the classical canonical pairs , @xmath147 where we have already accounted for the switch from time to propagation distance .",
    "these six coupled differential equations for the three degrees of freedom can be reduced to two degrees of freedom if we substitute the intensity @xmath148 and use the phase @xmath149 as reference , such that we define the phase differences @xmath150 for @xmath151 , ending up with just four coupled differential equations .",
    "this result is the coupled mode theory description of the propagation of intensity and phase .",
    "we can also choose the standard classical mechanics canonical pair provided by the field quadratures , @xmath152 and , again , consider classical variables to obtain equations of motion for the field quadratures , @xmath153 where , again , we have used kets to represent column vectors , @xmath154 with @xmath155 , and made the change from time to propagation distance . before moving on ,",
    "let us focus on the absolute value of the field amplitudes that we have been using to plot the dynamics of our optical trimers , @xmath156 .",
    "these square roots of the intensities at the three waveguides can be understood as a poincar phase space in the classical mechanics sense .",
    "then , we can follow a standard classical mechanics approach to find the action - phase variables of the system @xcite .",
    "if the phases are commensurate , the trajectories in phase space will be periodic , and if the phases are incommensurate , the trajectories will be ergodic and fill a region of the phase space defined by the energy of the initial state , @xmath157 for mode - coupling matrices that do not depend on the propagation distance , if the eigenvalues are commensurable , the trajectories in phase space are well - defined and closed , otherwise they will fill a region defined by the initial energy .",
    "figure [ fig : fig7 ] shows propagation trajectories of the absolute field amplitudes for the numerical propagation of random parameter sets and initial conditions yielding incommensurate eigenvalues and , thus , ergodic trajectories .",
    "let us focus our attention now on the vast class of incommensurate trajectories and , for the sake of simplicity , keep using optical devices that do not change with the propagation distance . in many design circumstances ,",
    "the exact point - to - point evolution of the field amplitudes is not of primary importance and it suffices to gain information on the general region that will be traversed .",
    "this is characterized by the boundary which encompasses the very region .",
    "it proves viable to notice that for a given energy , @xmath158 , and a given set of parameters , @xmath159 and @xmath160 , an infinity number of distinct trajectories prevails .",
    "the conjunction of all these propagation trajectories pertaining to a given energy span a path - connected surface .",
    "we will now find the outer boundary , or envelope , of all propagation trajectories related to an initial energy @xmath158 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : clhamiltonian ] ) readily reveals that the energy is maximized for given intensities @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 when all three phases are zero .",
    "consequently , the boundary is defined by all triplets @xmath164 that fulfill the following condition , @xmath165 with @xmath166 due to our normalization requirements , @xmath167 , the three intensities are not independent and we can safely omit the third intensity in the following discussion , @xmath168 .",
    "numerically , once a given set of initial intensities or energy is chosen , the envelope is characterized by the following differential equation , @xmath169 figure [ fig : fig8 ] shows this envelope for all possible trajectories with a given energy @xmath158 as a solid black line .",
    "now , we can turn to calculating the envelope of a single trajectory .",
    "we have already discussed how to find the propagator for any given three - waveguide coupler . in the particular case at hand ,",
    "constant effective refractive indices and couplings , the propagated field can be written as , @xmath170 where the vectors @xmath171 are the three normal modes of the coupler with corresponding eigenvalues @xmath172 and the normal mode decomposition parameters are defined as the inner product between the normal mode and the initial condition , @xmath173 .",
    "we can introduce a phase relevant parameter that distorts the ratio between eigenvalues , @xmath174 the parameter @xmath175 offsets a given trajectory .",
    "however , this can not hold true at the envelope and , hence , we can establish the following condition for the envelope , @xmath176 which is identical to requiring a null determinant , @xmath177 accordingly , the envelope can be calculated from the following differential equation , @xmath178 figure [ fig : fig8 ] shows two examples of envelopes for individual trajectories with particular initial field amplitudes and the same energy @xmath158 as dashed blue and dotted red lines .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to approach the propagation of electromagnetic field through triangular three - waveguide couplers , in terms of the lie algebra @xmath28 .",
    "we derived a formal solution  la wei - norman in line with the idea of gilmore - perelomov coherent states . in order to provide practical examples , we focused our attention on a reduced class of structures where the waveguides are identical and the effective couplings are constant , independent of the propagation distance , and christened them constant optical trimers .",
    "we established a connection between the equilateral trimer , actually any circular array of waveguides with identical couplings , and the discrete fourier transform , and between the isoceles trimer and the golden ratio where it is possible to suppress the energy transfer to one of the waveguides .",
    "for the sake of providing a propagation dependent example , we studied a system where all the waveguides get symmetrically closer or further apart following a linear z - dependent effective coupling",
    ". our results for passive triangular three - waveguide couplers may be useful for a theoretical approach to linear and nonlinear active devices .",
    "we went beyond the standard classical - quantum analogy in the single photon limit and showed that , using the classical limit , it is possible to recover the coupled mode differential equations describing the propagation of intensity and phase .",
    "furthermore , we also showed that working with the classical mechanics canonical pair , which are the equivalent of the electromagnetic field quadratures , allows us to calculate the envelope of all possible trajectories with a given initial energy as well as individual envelopes for specific input field amplitude distributions .",
    "all these results may provide a working platform for the design of photonic integrated devices where the main interest is to generate a specific output from a set of particular inputs instead of studying point - to - point propagation through the devices .",

    "<S> , we go beyond the standard optical - quantum analogy to show that it is possible to derive coupled - mode equations for intensity and phase , and that it is also possible to calculate envelopes for the propagation of all possible inputs belonging to an energy class , as well as individual input field amplitudes , without the need of point - to - point propagation . </S>"
