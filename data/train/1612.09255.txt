    "supersymmetry is among the most compelling possibilities for beyond the standard model physics .",
    "it offers a natural solution to the hierarchy problem , the possibility of the unification of forces , dark matter candidates , and a panoply of new particles which may be discovered at the scale of current colliders .",
    "the low energy spectrum of the mssm is , of course , completely dependent upon the mechanisms of the communication of susy breaking .",
    "simple and elegant susy breaking schemes exist which are predictive , containing only a small number of new parameters , as well as being flavor blind . among these ,",
    "for example are anomaly mediation or minimal gauge mediation@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "many minimal mass giving mechanisms produce spectra with a the uniform feature that scalars and gauginos have roughly equivalent masses . in addition particles charged under qcd are generally heavy , and other particles light .",
    "a typical ratio between the squarks and the light neutralinos , for example is 8 to 1 .",
    "experimental signatures of such models , while having some special identifying features , show a large degree of uniformity . among the most prominent signals of such models for example",
    "is jets plus missing energy .",
    "the expectation is that the gluinos will be among the first susy particles to be observed , with a large production cross section , and that they will decay through on or offshell quarks down to the lsp which is most canonically the lightest neutralino .",
    "it is possible to generate mssm spectra which are extremely divergent from minimal predictions .",
    "slightly more general models allow for a significant departures from standard collider signals .",
    "for example , a generalized definition of gauge mediation is simply that the mssm particle masses go to zero if the standard model gauge couplings are turned off @xcite .",
    "there are a large variety of models that fit this definition . in the original incarnation of general gauge mediation , the mssm spectrum depended on six mass parameters and satisfied certain sum rules .",
    "there are three separate mass parameters for gauginos and three more for scalars , one each for the su(3 ) , su(2 ) and u(1 ) components of the fields . in principle",
    ", the masses of the gauginos and the scalars are completely independent in these models , and need nt follow any standard pattern",
    ". this incarnation of general gauge mediation may be even further generalized , allowing different operators which allow for modified sum rules and possibly adding even more parameters in the spectra , for example a terms @xcite .",
    "a variety of susy models exist which produce highly non - standard spectra , and many of the interesting features of these models come from introducing a hierarchy between the scalar and gaugino masses . in split supersymmetry ,",
    "the gauginos are accessible to colliders , while the scalars are extremely heavy - producing signatures such as extremely long lived supersymmetric particles @xcite .",
    "supersoft supersymmetry is a mechanism with extra chiral adjoint fields in which the gauginos are around a tev in mass , and the scalars are a square root of a loop factor below the gaugino mass @xcite .",
    "there is also the higgsino world and its variants , in which all superpartners are multi tev and only the higgsino - like gauginos and higgs sector scalar fields are light and accessible to colliders @xcite .",
    "i propose to analyze here the phenomenology of a general class of models i refer to , with deference to the source material , as antisplit supersymmetric models .",
    "these are models in which the gaugino masses are much heavier than the scalar sparticle masses .",
    "exemplary models in this class include gaugino mediation@xcite @xcite and r - symmetric models in which gauginos are dirac instead of majorana particles @xcite .",
    "this spectrum , however can also be found in general gauge mediated models and models with hybrid gravity - gauge mediation as i will discuss later in this article .",
    "i will introduce models which maximize the gaugino - scalar mass splitting .",
    "in particular , i will here study models where gauginos are of the scale a few to 10 tev and thus inaccessible to colliders , while the scalar superpartners remain weak or tev scale with a compressed mass spectrum .",
    "the phenomenology of these models is quite different from that of standard mssm spectra",
    ". one can expect several interesting features .",
    "first , gaugino mass parameters are quite large , of order 10 tev , but the mu term remains weakscale , thus the lightest neutralino and charginos are higgsino - like . as has been pointed out in ref @xcite regarding supersoft models , since gauginos are very heavy , the production cross section of pairs of mssm sfermions - for example squarks- is much lower than in standard susy scenarios .",
    "this means that mass limits on squarks and sleptons from standard searches like jets plus missing energy , are quite a bit lower than other susy scenarios , even assuming quite simple decay scenarios for scalars .",
    "further , the scalar decay chains may become quite non - standard , involving decays through on or offshell higgsinos , often leading to heavy flavor fermions as decay products .",
    "the phenomenology of such spectra has been explored only in a piecemeal fashion such as @xcite .",
    "if the susy breaking scheme is gauge mediation , we can expect that nlsp to decay , perhaps inside the detector and possibly with a displaced vertex .",
    "the lsp candidates i will consider here are stau , higgsino , or sneutrino .",
    "decays of nlsps can put interesting particles in the final state such as taus , higgses or z bosons .",
    "standard gauge mediation with bino - like nlsp produces photons in the final state , but higgsino - like gauginos favor other final states .",
    "i present below an illustration of a typical antisplit mass spectrum        though it may seem that getting a spectrum in which gauginos are extremely heavy is theoretically challenging , it follows quite naturally by modifying certain existing models of susy breaking communication .",
    "i will give several examples of implementations susy breaking which achieve an antisplit spectrum .",
    "the achieve this spectrum i will take advantage of a special version of gauge mediation which allows negative r - symmetric contributions to scalar mass squareds which do not contribute to gaugino masses .    in order to demonstrate that this general spectrum can be achieved with many forms of susy breaking communication",
    ", i will discuss two models of a generalized general gauge mediation .",
    "one model is simply one in which gauginos have normal gauge mediated masses set to the multi tev scale .",
    "the scalar mass contributions are then canceled by gauge mediated masses which follow from additional messengers with negative supertrace .",
    "the gaugino masses may either be majorana or dirac , however the choice of dirac masses for gauginos means tuning in the model is substantially less .",
    "i will outline both typed of models and calculate example a mass spectra based on the dirac - gaugino model . in this set of models ,",
    "the gauginos acquire dirac masses by marrying fields which are adjoint under the standard model gauge groups .",
    "the scalars then get a finite mass contribution due to loops of the scalar adjoint which is the square root of a loop factor below the gaugino masses .",
    "this is the building block of a scheme where the gauginos are naturally larger than the scalars . by adding to this scheme additional messengers with negative supertraces the result is a modified supersoft model in which i can make the gauginos arbitrarily large compared to the scalars .",
    "i will then explore the phenomenology of models with these spectra .",
    "i will produce example spectra for the cases of stau , higgsino , and sneutrino nlsps .",
    "i will then enumerate the most probably decay chains for these particles with these mass spectra , and discuss the final state topologies most likely to be discovery scenario for this type of model",
    ".    this paper proceeds as follows , section 2 reviews general gauge mediation and presents several model - types capable of producing an antisplit supersymmetric spectrum , section 3 presents the phenomenology of a stau nlsp in this scenario , section 4 presents higgsino lsp / nlsp phenomenology while section 5 present sneutrino lsp / nlsp phenomenology .",
    "section 6 concludes .",
    "in general gauge mediation the minimal mass - relations between gauginos and scalars do not hold .",
    "gaugino masses are independent of each other and scalars may get mass independent of the gauginos . this may be achieved by including multiple sets of messengers , including multiple susy breaking spurions , and/or having several distinct susy breaking sectors @xcite@xcite .",
    "i will present below two simple models which are generalized models of gauge mediation capable of producing spectra in which the gauginos are much heavier than the scalar particles of mssm .",
    "supersoft mediation is a very simple and interesting mediation mechanism which naturally has light scalars compared to gauginos . in this scenario ,",
    "the gauginos get large dirac masses arising from the coupling of the gauginos to new chiral adjoints and a hidden sector @xmath0 gauge field which gets a d term . in the low energy , one may write a superpotential term w = c_i where @xmath1 is the hidden sector u(1 ) gauge field and a is the adjoint .",
    "the index i runs over the three sm gauge groups . here",
    "the gauge indices are contracted between @xmath2 and the adjoint while lorentz indices are contracted between the w s .",
    "once the @xmath0 d term is inserted , the operator becomes a dirac mass for the gauginos    c_i _ i _ ai which has the value @xmath3 .",
    "all of the gauginos may have independent mass parameters as the coupling @xmath4 may vary for each gaugino .",
    "one can imagine generating the susy breaking d term by employing any number of dynamical models @xcite , or simpler oraigherty - like models in which u(1 ) is the only gauge group in the dsb sector @xcite @xcite .",
    "it is simple enough to ensure that the gaugino masses arise from a general gauge mediated mechanism .",
    "one can generate the above coupling of adjoint fields the mssm gauginos by employing a set of messenger fields , which are charged both under the standard model gauge groups and the new u(1 ) gauge symmetry .",
    "one may write a superpotential for messenger fields , here called t.    w_t= m_t t+ y_iat where the messengers have a supersymmetric mass term . a one loop mass diagram for gauginos",
    "is generated resulting gaugino a gaugino mass term    m__i =    note that this mass term does indeed comply with the definition of a general gauge mediated model , that is , the gaugino mass goes to zero if the standard model gauge coupling is turned off .    only after the gaugino has gotten mass",
    "are the scalar mass - squared s generated .",
    "these masses are finite and one loop level lower than the gaugino masses , involving the gauginos or real scalar adjoint in the loop .",
    "the scalar masses from the supersoft process are m_s^2= ( ) ^2 where @xmath5 are the gaugino masses , @xmath6 is the mass squared of the real part of the adjoint field and @xmath7 are the casimirs of the fields .",
    "one can see that in this model the scalars are naturally much lighter than the gauginos , the ratio between mssm scalar and gaugino masses is = under normal circumstances , the value of the log in the above equation is 4 , as the real part of the scalar adjoint is twice the gaugino mass .",
    "we then we expect 10 tev gauginos to yield roughly 1 tev scalar particles .",
    "however , if @xmath6 equals @xmath5 , the gaugino masses make no contribution supersoft scalar masses at all .",
    "as one changes the value of this log , the gauginos may be made arbitrarily heavier than the scalars .",
    "indeed both the scalar and pseudo - scalar adjoint fields receive corrections to their susy breaking masses through loop effects .",
    "the value of these corrections depends on the details of the model .",
    "for example , in gauge mediated implementations , the value of these operators will be determined by the specific number and masses of the messenger fields t. discussions of these operators may be found , for example , in @xcite @xcite @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one very simple way to achieve negative scalar mass contributions is though an r symmetric process .",
    "one adds to the model a new set gauge messengers with non - holomorphic masses .",
    "these then create two loop log divergent scalar masses which are proportional to the messenger supertrace .",
    "these mass contributions were first calculated by calculated in @xcite@xcite and are given by    m^2_i = - _ a s_q c_ai str m_mess^2 ( ) where s is the dynkin index of the messengers , @xmath8 is the casimir for the scalars , and m is the supersymmetric messenger mass .",
    "these masses have several interesting features , first note they are slightly uv sensitive as they are log divergent .",
    "second , the physics involved in generating these masses is r symmetric , it contributes to the scalar mass squareds without changing the gaugino masses . finally",
    ", the scalar mass squareds have signs which are the opposite of the sign of the messenger supertrace ; therefore messengers with positive supertrace will yield the negative mass contributions desired for adjoints without changing the gaugino masses .",
    "the messengers may participate in a two tiered system where themselves receive non - zero supertraces from gauge mediation as in @xcite , but they may perhaps get supertraces in some form of direct mediation , where the messengers themselves participate in susy breaking @xcite .",
    "the spectra generated for such a model are quite interesting .",
    "first there are three independent gaugino masses given by eqn .",
    "the scalar masses are given by two contributions ,    m_s^2=m_supersoft^2+m_supertrace^2 the supertrace mass term is given by eqn .",
    "7 , it is a contribution felt by all scalars , including scalar adjoint fields , as it arises due to the presence of a new set of gauge messengers charged under the standard model gauge groups . here",
    "the supersoft mass contributions to the mssm scalars(excluding the adjoints ) is given by ^2= ( ) ^2    where    _ i^2= ( 2_i)^2- _ a s_q c_ai str m_mess^2 ( )    is the mass squared of the real scalar adjoint fields , which itself gets mass contribution from additional supertrace - ful messengers . in the above equations additional contributions to the scalar adjoint mass are neglected .",
    "they themselves will not effect the spectrum too much as they are expected , at most , to be of the size @xmath9 , if the messenger sector has been so arranged to ensure their positivity .",
    "we can see that the addition of new messengers , themselves with positive supertrace , may subtract substantially from mssm scalar masses and drastically alter the scalar / gaugino mass ratio in eqn 6 . in order to make a substantial mass correction , the supersoft and supertrace terms in eqn .",
    "8 must cancel at order 1 . in order to make a mass contribution of order weak scale",
    ", we should demand that the messenger supertrace should be in the region of 10 to 100 tev .      a second method for generating",
    "an anti - split spectrum follows as a simple modification to normal gauge mediated models with majorana gaugino masses .",
    "i present here a model which is quite simple , but very tuned .",
    "the simplest incarnations of gauge mediation require only the presence of messengers charged under the standard model gauge groups , which also couple to a susy breaking spurion .",
    "the spurion has both a vev and an f term , generating a supersymmetric and non - supersymmetric mass for the messengers , one can write the messenger superpotential w = x",
    "m v m + ^2 f_x m where x is the susy breaking spurion and m are the messengers , in a fundamental and anti - fundamental of the sm gauge group su(5 ) .",
    "majorana gaugino masses are generated though a one loop process involving the messengers .",
    "the resulting gaugino mass is m_i = f / v",
    ".    note that in this case all gaugino masses are proportional to a single mass parameter .",
    "if one employs multiple susy breaking spurions and several sets of messengers whose su(2 ) and su(3 ) components couple differently to the spurion , similar one loop messenger diagrams can generate three distinct mass parameters for gauginos as in @xcite .",
    "generating multi - tev gaugino masses in this scenario simple requires the correct choice of the parameters @xmath10 .",
    "the problem with the spectrum is that scalar masses are generated at two loop order and are roughly of equivalent size the gaugino masses ,    m_s^2 ~^2 f^2/v^2    however one can see from the previous subsection , that it is possible to generate r symmetric negative contributions to scalar mass squareds by adding messengers with a positive supertrace .",
    "thus , to get an antisplit mass spectrum easily and without the addition of extra adjoint fields , one may simply cancel the normal gauge mediated scalar masses against the r symmetric gauge mediated scalar masses .",
    "m_i = f / v    m_s^2 ~^2 f^2/v^2 - _ a^2 s_q c_ai str m_mess^2 ( )    in this case , if one wished to generate 10 tev gauginos , then two loop gauge mediated diagrams will also generate 10 tev scalars . canceling the scalar masses down to the weak scale involves tuning the two mass squared parameters to cancel to one part in ten thousand , a simple but uncomfortable prospect .",
    "this would also require a fairly large messenger supertrace and would favor a higher energy susy breaking scale than the previous example .",
    "another quite simple way to get a spectrum in which the gauginos are heavy compared to the scalars is to use the gravity mediated formalism .",
    "this , most simply involves msugra . here",
    ", one usually gives the scalars and the gauginos universal masses at a very high scale .",
    "the masses are then run down to a the collider scale and the mass differences observed in the spectrum occur only due to running .",
    "the @xmath11 term is a parameter picked by hand .",
    "this can always be adjusted to ensure that the higgsino is much lighter than the gluino / weakinos .",
    "some of the work achieving an antisplit susy spectrum can be done by adjusting the ratio of the scalar mass @xmath12 to the gaugino mass parameter @xmath13 .",
    "one may also effect the phenomenology by choosing the value of the high energy scale , which controls how long the mass parameters are run .",
    "this alone , however is not enough . to achieve true flexibility of the spectrum one can add a bit of general gauge mediation , namely , the same negative mass contribution as the models above , gotten adding additional messenger fields with positive supertrace . in principle",
    "these type of messengers can also be added to deflected mirage mediation @xcite .",
    "in which one combined the mediation mechanisms of gravity mediation , anomaly mediation and normal gauge mediation . in standard",
    "deflected mirage mediation one picks universal scale @xmath14 from which sparticle masses evolve from the combination of gravity and anomaly mediation .",
    "in addition one adds sets of gauge messengers with an f term mass and supersymmetric mass v , from the vev of a dynamical field .",
    "one sets the scale of f / v just like in normal gauge mediation and this deflects the susy mass spectrum . in principle , one could instead add r - symmetric gauge mediation discussed above where messengers only get a non - holomorphic mass from susy breaking .",
    "one adds sets of messengers with supertraces @xmath15 the index i indicating su(3 ) , su(2 ) or u(1 ) messengers at some arbitrary susy breaking scale .",
    "as the theory runs this will generate negative mass squared contributions to the mssm scalar particles .",
    "this will subtract arbitrary mass contributions to the mssm scalars charged under the three gauge groups and many variant low energy spectra may be achieved .",
    "the decay chains in the case of an deflected msugra scenario are quite different than in the general gauge mediated scenarios as in msugra , the gravitino is not the lsp . in gauge mediation , the nlsp may decay to its superpartner and a gravitino inside the detector , which adds states to the decay chain . in the deflected msugra scenario however , the lsp may not be a stau but must be a neutral particle .    in the phenomenology section below , i am mostly concerned with gauge mediated signatures of antisplit susy and most of the discussion will involve the decay of the nlsp inside the detector .",
    "below i will describe the phenomenology of several benchmark spectra of antisplit models , classifying the models by lsp or nlsp as the case may be .",
    "general gauge mediated scenarios allow for a wide variety of nlsp candidates @xcite@xcite .",
    "in gauge mediated models the gravitino acquires a mass that depends on the susy breaking f term @xmath16 . there is a universal coupling of sparticle to their particle partners and to the gravitino .",
    "this decay width is suppressed by powers of the susy breaking scale f. for example the decay width of a sfermion into fermion and gravitino is _ = ( 1-)^4 in the case of low energy susy breaking , the gravitino is quite light and the nlsp will decay to the gravitino in short order .",
    "the limit for decay length @xmath17 inside the detector places an upper bound on the f term of roughly @xmath18 gev .",
    "we may demand that the sparticle decay take place inside the detector , for gauge mediated scenarios and demand that for antisplit models the gauginos lie in the multi to 10 tev range .",
    "this then limits the messenger mass m are at quite a low scale , not above @xmath19 gev with the f term not much below . for scenarios where the nlsp does not decay inside the detector , we may probe higher susy breaking and messenger scales .",
    "prospects for susy breaking in this scenario are quite interesting .",
    "first , for ggm models with prompt nlsp decay , we are impinging on the perturbative requirement that @xmath20 .",
    "this brings us into the realm of direct mediation , where the messengers themselves participate in susy breaking .",
    "models with dirac gauginos often require that susy breaking comes from a d term .",
    "however this is a field dependent d term , which comes from f - term susy breaking , often at a higher scale .",
    "it is , however possible to choose a susy breaking sector such that the d - term and the f - terms are roughly of the same order .",
    "this occurs , for example in the 4 - 1 model .",
    "this is , however , a further indication that the susy breaking sectors required for low scale f terms are complex .",
    "a second note is here in order , these models naturally demand an f term which is just on the edge of nslp decay inside the detector .",
    "this means that the models discussed naturally lend themselves to the nlsp decaying with @xmath17 in the mm to meter range , leaving a striking signal of displaced vertices and long lived particles .    in the case that the sparticle can not decay to a final state gravitino inside the detector or otherwise , the set of lsps is constrained to be neutral .",
    "stable charges particles are would cause a cosmological catastrophe , in addition collider bounds on neutral particles are quite weak .",
    "therefore i consider in this work relevant stable lsp / nlsps to be neutral , either the lightest neutralino or the sneutrino . in the case",
    "that the lightest sparticle is unstable , and gauge mediation obtains , the nlsp may be charged , as it decays to a final state charged standard model particle and gravitino .",
    "i will consider in this case the set of nlsps to be the @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 . in creating supersymmetric spectra for these cases ,",
    "i have pulled benchmark points from the modified supersoft model in the second section .",
    "i chose this model as it was the least tuned and most phenomenologically viable .",
    "an interesting point about these models is that they may be completed with a number of new higgs sector operators which aid in electroweak symmetry breaking , provide mu terms and substantially raise the higgs mass even for lower values of @xmath24 and lighter stop masses @xcite@xcite .",
    "i consider here the phenomenology of a gauge mediated model with a stau nlsp . in such a model the stau is the final sparticle in the mssm decay chains , which then decays promptly to a gravitino and a tau .",
    "i have created an example mssm mass spectrum using the modified supersoft model .",
    "here i have chosen gaugino mass parameters @xmath25=5tev @xmath26=@xmath27=6tev .",
    "the supertrace of the additional messengers was chosen in the 10 tev range .",
    "the spectrum appears below in table 1 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ fields ]    in have laid out the phenomenology of a general class as susy models where the gauginos are much heavier than the scalars .",
    "these models have highly non - standard phenomenology , with particles exhibiting complex decay chains .",
    "typical of these spectra in general are the fact that the only chargino and neutralinos capable of being produced at collider energies are the higgsinos , which means the final state topologies of many particle decays large likely to contain highly mass degenerate states and may prefer decay chains with taus .",
    "in addition multiple jets and leptons of varying flavor may occur in sparticle decays .",
    "these models are relatively easy to realize by turning to generalize versions of gauge mediation , here i have presented spectra by modifying models in which the scalars are naturally the square root of a loop factor below the gaugino masses .",
    "no doubt there are many other ways to implement this kind of phenomenology . one interesting question is whether other complete mechanisms for susy breaking communication can deliver similar anti - split spectra . for example , one may conceive of building anomaly mediated models in which the scale of @xmath28 is high , leading to heavy gauginos , while the scalar particles receive extra contributions , say by deflecting the anomaly mediated trajectory with gauge messengers- some kind of general deflected anomaly mediation .",
    "previous combination of anomaly mediation with dirac gauginos have lead to interesting spectra and complete , viable higgs sectors @xcite .    below i",
    "summarize phenomenological results with a table of most likely signal topologies for the most likely decay scenarios for pair production of sparticles in each of the three nlsp scenarios i presented . here , since i have picked spectra with modest @xmath24 values , i have presented the higgsino decays as higgs dominated .",
    "there are many explorations to be made concerning the phenomenology of anti - split models .",
    "the smoking gun signatures of such a scenario are quite different than what one expects to see in usual scenarios .",
    "some standard signals are almost completely absent , for example the tri - lepton signature of chargino / neutralino pair production . while other signatures , such the presence of multiple particle of heavy flavor , are present in many decay chains where they were not before .",
    "some decay chains in antisplit scenarios are quite surprising , for example , in the case of sneutrino lsp , the signal for lepton pair production only yields leptons plus missing energy a few percent of the time , the rest of the time the signal is jets .",
    "discovery signals in this scenario may be challenging and existing lower mass bounds on this model may be quite weak .",
    "this work was made possible with funds from doe grant de - sc0013529 .",
