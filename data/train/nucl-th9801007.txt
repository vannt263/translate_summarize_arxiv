    "a qcd - based space - time model that allows to simulate nucleus - nucleus collisions ( among other particle collisions ) , is now available as a computer simulation program called vni @xcite .",
    "it is a pqcd parton cascade description @xcite , supplemented by a phenomenological hadronization model @xcite , with dynamically changing proportions of partons and hadrons , in which the evolution of a nuclear collision is traced from the first instant of overlap , via qcd parton - cascade development at the early stage , parton conversion into pre - hadronic color - singlet clusters and hadron production through the decays of the clusters , as well as the fragmentation of the beam remnants at late times .",
    "( i will in the following refer to the parton - cascade / cluster - hadronization model as pcm , and to its monte carlo implementation as vni . ) the pcm description has been used @xcite to provide very useful insight into the dynamics of the evolution of the matter at energies likely to be reached at bnl rhic and cern lhc .",
    "the experimental data for these will , however , come only in the next millennium .",
    "recently , d. srivastava and myself have taken steps to investigate collisions at the cern sps and compare the model calculations with the increasing body of experimental data , thereby addressing the the question : _ can one really use the pcm picture already at the sps energies _",
    "( @xmath2 1720 gev / a ) ? recall that the parameters of the models were fixed by the experimental data for @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) cross - sections over @xmath5 = 101800 gev , and @xmath6 annihilation @xcite .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon energy reached at sps is well within this range . indeed , as shown in @xcite , this approach does remarkably well in comparison to the gross particle production properties observed at cern sps .",
    "this came as a surprise , since no attempt was made to fine - tune the model to the data .",
    "in figs . 1 and 2 , i have plotted examples of the results of @xcite , for the relatively ` light ' system @xmath7 and for the most ` heavy ' system @xmath8 .",
    "the first plot shows the rapidity distribution of negative hadrons in central collisions of sulfur nuclei , whereas the second plot shows the transverse mass spectra of negative hadrons in central lead - lead colisions . in comparison with the corresponding experimental data ,",
    "it is evident that a decent description is obtained , and this without any adjustments of parameters .",
    "the analysis of @xcite concluded :    \\(i ) the simulations of heavy - ion collsions give a good overall description of the cern sps data on rapidity and transverse energy distributions , the multiplicity distributions , as well as a reasonable description of the transverse momentum distribution of hadrons .",
    "this success may be taken as a ` post - hum ' justification of the applicability of a pqcd parton decription even at cern sps energies .",
    "\\(ii ) contrary to wide - spread belief , at cern sps energy the ` hard ' ( perturbative ) parton production and parton cascading is an important element for particle production at central rapidities - at least in @xmath8 collisions . in effect",
    "it provides almost 50 @xmath9 of final particles around mid - rapidity .",
    "` soft ' ( non - perturbative ) parton interactions on the other hand are found to be insignificant in their effect on final - state particle distibutions .",
    "let me now turn to the problem of the observed strong suppression of @xmath0 production in pb + pb collisions , following a recent work @xcite by b. mller and myself .",
    "in particular , i would like to discuss briefly the @xmath11-dependence of the absorption of the @xmath0 by comoving produced hadronic matter .",
    "the key element in the following arguments is the fact that , for most nuclear collision systems at the relatively low center - of - mass energy of the cern - sps experiments , perturbative mini - jet production is largely due to quark - quark scattering , because the typical value of bjorken-@xmath12 probed is @xmath13 , where the gluon density is small .",
    "this implies that shadowing effects are negligible as explained in @xcite and the critical momentum @xmath14 where these effects turn on , lies below the perturbatively accessible range of momenta @xmath15 gev at the sps energy , and may just begin to reach into it for the pb + pb system .",
    "if this is correct , then _ all _ mini - jet production involving momenta @xmath15 gev lies safely above @xmath16 . as immediate consequence , the density of comovers which can effectively interact and absorb the @xmath0 at the sps grows like @xmath17 , or @xmath18 in asymmetric collisions .",
    "this is a _ much stronger @xmath11-dependence _ than naively expected and embodied in most comover suppression models @xcite .",
    "it also implies a _ stronger impact parameter or @xmath19-dependence _ of comover suppression than predicted by existing models .",
    "quantitative support for these speculations comes from recent calculations of secondary particle production in the parton cascade model , usisng vni @xcite .",
    "the calculations predict that the energy density @xmath20 produced by scattering partons ( mini - jets ) at central rapidity grows by a factor of more than 2 between @xmath21 and @xmath22 , compatible with the scaling law @xmath23 , but much faster than expected in the usual glauber model approach which predicts @xmath24 , in which case @xmath20 increases only by 30 @xmath9 .      in @xmath22 collisions the initial partonic energy density @xmath20",
    "is predicted to reach 5 gev/@xmath25 at times @xmath26 fm/@xmath27 in the comoving reference frame ( fig .",
    "3 ) . for a thermalized gas of free gluons and three flavors of light",
    "quarks this corresponds to an initial temperature @xmath28 mev , clearly above the critical temperature @xmath29 mev predicted by lattice - qcd calculations @xcite shown in fig .",
    "4 . on the other hand , the parton density @xmath30 2 gev/@xmath25 predicted for @xmath21 collisions ( fig .",
    "3 ) , just lies at the upper end of the transition region in the equation of state from lattice - qcd .",
    "the temperature @xmath31 required for dissociation of the @xmath0 bound state due to color screening is known @xcite to be higher than @xmath32 , namely @xmath33 mev .",
    "the parton cascade model results are therefore compatible with the experimental finding that there appears to exist no significant comover - induced suppression of @xmath0 in @xmath21 collisions , but a large and strongly impact parameter dependent effect is observed in pb + pb collisions .",
    "it must be stressed that the model results do not contradict the experimental data collected at the sps , as one might suspect , since it is usually claimed that those are fully consistent with the glauber picture , in particular with the transverse energy production ( fig .",
    "5 ) and the linear @xmath34 relation ( fig .",
    "6 ) , both wich are in good agreement with the corresponding measured data @xcite .          9 k. geiger , comp .",

    "<S> there seems to be a general consensus now that a first glimpse of a qgp - like effect has become visible in the beautiful na50 data on @xmath0 production and the ` anomalous supression ' phenomenon . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> it is still widely believed that the dynamics of heavy - ion collisions at cern sps energy is predominantly governed by soft , non - perturbative physics . </S>",
    "<S> this is ironic : after all , it is unlikely that a qgp could be formed if the underlying dynamics were essentyially soft , rather than that it requires intense quark - gluon production with sufficient cascade - like reinteractions which drive the matter to large density and equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , i advocate in this contribution that for ultra - relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions a description based on the pqcd interactions and cascade evolution of involved partons can and should be used , owing to the claim that short - range parton interactions play an important role at sufficiently high beam energies , including cern energy @xmath1 a gev . here </S>",
    "<S> mini - jet production which liberates of quarks and gluons can not be considered as an isolated rare phenomenon , but can occur quite copiously and may lead to complex multiple cascade - type processes . </S>"
