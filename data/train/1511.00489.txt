    "a free quantum field theory ( qft ) can be treated as an infinite quantum system of simple harmonic oscillators , with its fundamental excitations interpreted as the associated particles .",
    "thus , the vacuum in qft is the state in which all quantum oscillators are in its ground state .",
    "but , as we know , the energy of the ground state of a quantum harmonic oscillator is not zero .",
    "consequently , the vacuum energy , being the sum of the energies of the ground states of these oscillators , is infinite .",
    "the qft offers several examples which show that this vacuum plays a fundamental role not only in the physics of microscopic phenomena , but also the physics of macroscopic phenomena .",
    "one of these phenomena the casimir effect @xcite .",
    "the casimir effect is one of the most notable consequences of vacuum quantum fluctuations . in its most general description ,",
    "the casimir effect is a consequence of the changes caused in the vacuum energy due to the presence of boundary conditions imposed on the fields .",
    "the effect was first predicted theoretically by h. b casimir in 1948 @xcite , and experimentally confirmed ten years later by m. j. sparnnaay @xcite . in the 90s ,",
    "experiments have confirmed the casimir effect with high degree of accuracy @xcite . in his original work casimir predicted that due to quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field , two parallel flat neutral ( grounded ) plates attract each other with a force given by : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the area of plates and @xmath2 is the distance between them .",
    "the casimir effect is traditionally studied by changing up the idealized effects of borders by boundary conditions .",
    "once the theory of relativity is the basis for qft , the lorentz symmetry is a fully conserved symmetry in this theory .",
    "however , other theories include models where the lorentz symmetry is violated . in the quantum gravity , horava - lifshitz ( hl )",
    "theory is a theory where the lorentz symmetry is broken in a strong manner .",
    "the space - time anisotropy caused by the breaking of lorentz symmetry , occurs due to different properties of scales in which coordinates space and time are set , so that the theory is invariant under the rescaling @xmath3 , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a number called the critical exponent @xcite .",
    "the space - time anisotropy in a given field theory model should certainly modify the spectrum of the hamiltonian operator given .    the hl approach , or ,",
    "as is the same , the idea of the space - time anisotropy , clearly can be applied not only to gravity , but also to other field theory models , including scalar , spinor and gauge theories .",
    "one of the main reasons for interest to hl - like generalizations of these theories consists in possible improvement of convergence of quantum corrections . among the most important results achieved within their studies",
    ", one can emphasize calculation of the one - loop effective potential in hl - like qed and hl - like yukawa model @xcite and study of different issues related to renormalization of these theories @xcite .",
    "therefore , the problem of study of the casimir effect in hl - like generalizations of different field theories seems to be quite natural .",
    "some preliminary studies in this direction , for a very particular case , were performed in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we intend to generalize the results obtained in @xcite through the analysis the influence of the combination of the two above mentioned effects on the vacuum energy associated with a real quantum scalar field , i.e. , by the imposition of specific boundary conditions on the fields and the lorentz - breaking symmetry .",
    "in fact , we want to study the quantum scalar field in two different configurations : between two parallel plates and inside a rectangular two - dimensional box . in section [ sect2 ]",
    "we briefly derive the equation of motion obeyed by the field in a lorentz symmetry breaking context . in section [ sect3 ]",
    "we explicitly develop the calculations considering the quantum system confined between two parallel plates and a two - dimensional rectangular box . in both situations we impose on the field dirichlet , neumann and mixed boundary conditions on the boundaries .",
    "finally we leave for conclusions [ concl ] our most relevant remarks found in this paper .",
    "the lorentz invariance , known as a cornerstone of the quantum field theory , began to be intensively questioned in recent decades , both within theoretical and experimental contexts . in 1989 , v. a. kostelecky and s. samuel @xcite described a mechanism in string theory which allows violation of lorentz symmetry at the planck energy scale .",
    "this mechanism is based on a spontaneous breaking of the lorentz symmetry implemented through acquiring non - zero vacuum expectation values by some vectors or tensors , which implies privileged directions and hence anisotropy in space - time .",
    "this effect is called _ condensation _ of tensors in vacuum .",
    "the breaking happened at the planck energy scale in a more fundamental theory , and the effects of this break manifest themselves for other energy scales in different field theory models , for example the standard model , were not detected up to now , because such effects are suppressed by powers of the planck mass .",
    "kostelecky and samuel also evaluated that this idea of lorentz symmetry breaking should be incorporated into the standard model ( sm ) , thus giving rise to the standard model extended ( sme ) . the proposed lorentz symmetry breaking is intensively tested through observations and experiments",
    "so , astronomic observations in the star spectrum , show an evidence that the fine structure constant @xmath6 , which is a measure of intensity of the electromagnetic interaction between photons and electrons , slowly varies @xcite .",
    "later studies indicated that other mechanisms for breaking of lorentz symmetry are also possible , such as space - time noncommutativity @xcite , variation of coupling constants @xcite and modifications of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "further , in the paper @xcite , the concept of large lorentz symmetry breaking , or , as it is mostly called , space - time asymmetry , has been introduced .",
    "following this idea , the time and space coordinates , and derivatives with respect to them , enter in the action in different degrees , so , the action continues to be quadratic in time derivatives to avoid arising the ghosts , but involves higher spatial derivatives , whose order is @xmath7 .",
    "namely these theories will be the main object of our study here .      in the seminal work @xcite horava called a great attention to theories with space - time asymmetry , since it revitalized a hope to solve the key problem of quantum gravity , that is , to find a renormalizable and ghost - free gravity theory .",
    "indeed , the four - dimensional hl gravity is power - counting renormalizable for @xmath8",
    ".    using the hl approach , in the next section we will discuss how the lorentz symmetry violation interferes in the vacuum structure of a quantum scalar field theory .",
    "we will study the casimir effect which has been well studied in the usual field theories . before that , we first need to see how the hl theory modifies the klein - gordon equation .",
    "we work with a theory which space - time coordinates no longer have the same _ weight _ , as in the case where lorentz symmetry is preserved . in this scenario",
    ", we consider the theory of a massless real scalar field , which is the simplest case .",
    "the action associated with this system is given by @xcite : @xmath9    in the case ( 3 + 1)-dimensions the equation of motion is : @xmath10\\phi = 0   \\    .\\ ] ]    the equation is the modified klein - gordon equation within the hl - like theory .",
    "it will be used in next section where we will study the changes that the breaking of lorentz symmetry implies on the casimir effect .",
    "in this section we will study how the space - time anisotropy generated by the hl theory modifies the results of the casimir effect associated with a massless scalar quantum field . in what follows ,",
    "we study two distinct cases . in the first one we consider this effect between two parallel plates and the second inside a two - dimensional rectangular box . in both cases we deal with three kinds of boundary conditions .",
    "we consider a massless scalar field inside two parallel plates , as it is shown in figure [ fig1 ] . as we saw in the previous section , the equation that a massless real scalar field must satisfy in the hl theory",
    "is given by :     separated by a distance @xmath11.,width=302,height=188 ]    @xmath12\\phi(x ) = 0 \\    .\\ ] ]    first we must obtain the solution for by imposing on the fields specific boundary conditions and thus obtain the hamiltonian @xmath13 operator .",
    "afterwords , we can calculate the total vacuum energy of the system and then determine the casimir energy .",
    "subsequently we will obtain casimir force . in the @xmath14-dimensional case",

    "moreover , we can write , @xmath152\\frac{\\partial f(x)}{\\partial x } \\ .\\ ] ]    we have seen then that the lorentz symmetry breaking , employed by hl theory , modifies the vacuum structure , resulting in a change in the casimir effects results .",
    "the hl theory parameter @xmath5 is the one that dictates what the outcome of the effect .",
    "we have seen that for @xmath5 even , the casimir force is always zero , while for @xmath5 odd the casimir force switches between an attractive and a repulsive ones .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the casimir effects associated to a massless scalar real quantum field in the theory with a space - time asymmetry . to do it , we used the modified klein - gordon equation to study the casimir effect in the hl - like theory .",
    "two different situations are considered : the field confined between two parallel plates , and the field confined in a two - dimensional rectangular boxes . in this case we have admitted that the field obeys specific boundary condition .",
    "first we study the casimir effect for two parallel plates of area @xmath197 separated by a distance @xmath97 .",
    "for this case , we imposed three different types of boundary conditions on field @xmath17 at the boundary : dirichlet , neumann and mixed conditions . in each case",
    "we obtained the casimir energy , and found that in all cases , it is given by a divergent sum .",
    "we evaluated this sum by using the abel - plana summation formulas .",
    "considering the dirichlet and neumann conditions , we observed that this sum has a three - term contribution : the free vacuum energy contribution ( borderless ) , vacuum energy contribution in the presence of only one plate , and finally the vacuum energy contribution in the presence of two plates . at the same time , for the mixed conditions , we saw that the sum is contributed by only two terms : vacuum energy contribution to the presence of only one plate and the vacuum energy contribution in the presence of two plates .",
    "both contributions , free vacuum energy and the vacuum energy in the presence of only one plate are infinite terms that are subtracted by the renormalization process , thus we obtained the finite casimir energy .",
    "after that we calculate the casimir pressures . as in the usual cases where the lorentz symmetry is preserved ,",
    "the casimir pressure to the dirichlet and neumann conditions of are equal and differ from the one to the mixed condition . in all three cases",
    "we have seen that the casimir pressure depends on the hl theory parameter @xmath5 .",
    "for @xmath53 we recover the usual results where the lorentz symmetry is preserved , for @xmath5 even we saw that the casimir pressure is always zero , while for @xmath5 odd the casimir pressure switches corresponding to an attractive or repulsive forces .",
    "we also consider the casimir effect in a two - dimensional rectangular box with edges `` @xmath138 '' and `` @xmath97 '' .",
    "again we impose three different types of boundary conditions to the field @xmath17 : dirichlet , neumann and mixed one .",
    "we found that the casimir energy for the three cases is given in terms of infinite sums . using the abel - plana formula to develop these sums",
    ", we saw that the casimir energy is again given by three contributions : the free vacuum energy , the vacuum energy at the presence only two edges of the rectangle and the vacuum energy in the presence of the rectangle .",
    "we have seen that the free vacuum energy and the vacuum energy at presence of only two edges of the rectangle are terms infinite , and these are subtracted in the renormalization process , so that we obtained the finite casimir energy .",
    "thus we calculate the casimir forces and see that they depend on the hl theory parameter @xmath5 , where for @xmath5 even the forces vanishes , while for @xmath5 odd , we have the forces that switches the signal , which can be an attractive or repulsive force depending on the value of @xmath5 .    in general , we can affirm that the hl - like modification change the equation of motion that a field must satisfy in a theory , and this change has a crucial implication on a very well known effect in the literature , the casimir one .",
    "moreover , the casimir force also depends also on the types of conditions and also depend on hl theory parameter @xmath5 .",
    "where once the casimir force depended only on the type of condition imposed on the field , we have that in this context the casimir force also depends on a theory parameter of in question .    the natural application of the results we obtained can be the following one .",
    "since the casimir effect now can be measured in a very precise manner , our corrections to the casimir effect arising from the lorentz - breaking modifications of the field theory action , calculated theoretically and then compared with the experiment , can serve for estimating the values of the lorentz - breaking parameters in the corresponding theory .",
    "a natural continuation of this study could consist , first , in consideration of casimir effect for other fields ; second , in studying of the casimir effect for small lorentz - breaking additive corrections whose actions are discussed in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
