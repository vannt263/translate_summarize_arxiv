    "within the quark - bag model , the @xmath0 dibaryon , a six - quark [ two up ( @xmath15 ) , two down ( @xmath16 ) and two strange ( @xmath17 ) ] state with spin - parity @xmath18 , and isospin @xmath19 , was predicted to be a stable system with a mass about 80 mev below the @xmath13 threshold , some 35 years ago  @xcite .",
    "later calculations , which included the center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "@xcite and pionic - cloud  @xcite corrections within this model , predicted this state to be much less bound or even unbound . around the same time calculations performed within",
    "a quark cluster model also found it unbound  @xcite .",
    "since then a lot of experimental effort has gone into searching for the @xmath0 dibaryon [ see , e.g. , the review  @xcite for references up to the year 2000 and refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite for more recent investigations done by japan s national laboratory for high energy physics ( kek ) and the star collaboration at the bnl relativistic heavy ion collider , respectively ] .",
    "these studies have led to the conclusion that the existence of this system as a deeply bound object is highly unlikely . at the same time , the observation of the double-@xmath6 hypernucleus @xmath20he ( nagara event ) and the precise determination of its binding energy at kek in the experiment e373 @xcite have put a lower limit of 2.224 gev to the @xmath0 dibaryon mass at a 90@xmath21 confidence level , which is just about 6.9 mev below the @xmath13 threshold .",
    "the interest in the @xmath0 dibaryon has been revived by the recent lattice quantum chromodynamics ( lqcd ) calculations of different groups .",
    "the nplqcd  @xcite and hal qcd  @xcite collaborations have reported that the @xmath0 particle is indeed bound at somewhat larger than physical pion masses .",
    "however , extrapolations of the calculations of these groups to the physical pion mass region suggest @xcite that this particle is likely to be in either a very loosely bound state or an unbound state near the @xmath13 threshold . in a very recent chiral constituent quark model calculation",
    "@xcite , the value extracted for the binding energy of the @xmath0 particle has been found to be compatible with the restrictions imposed by the nagara event .",
    "these results together with the previous experiments  @xcite that give an upper limit for the cross section of the @xmath0 production in the @xmath2c(@xmath22 reaction , have led to a proposal to look for this particle in a future experiment  @xcite at the japan proton accelerator research complex ( jparc ) using a high - intensity @xmath8 beam .",
    "this is expected to answer the long standing question about the existence of the @xmath0 dibaryon .",
    "furthermore , with the measurement of the exclusive @xmath23 production in the @xmath24 reaction at the jefferson laboratory  @xcite , a possibility has been opened for producing the @xmath0 dibaryon with a photon beam .",
    "the @xmath1 reaction leads to the transfer of two units of both charge and strangeness to the target nucleus .",
    "thus this reaction is one of the most promising ways of studying the production of @xmath25 systems such as @xmath26 hypernuclei and the @xmath0 dibaryon .",
    "recently , the production of cascade hypernuclei via the @xmath1 reaction on nuclear targets , has been investigated within an effective lagrangian model  @xcite .",
    "this is a new approach , where the @xmath5 production vertex is described by excitation , propagation and decay of @xmath6 and @xmath7 resonance intermediate states in the initial collision of the @xmath8 meson with a target proton in the incident channel .",
    "the @xmath23 hyperon gets captured into one of the nuclear orbits leading to the formation of the @xmath23 hypernucleus . in calculations of the @xmath23 hypernuclear production cross sections ,",
    "one requires the bound state spinors for the proton hole and @xmath23 particle bound states .",
    "these were obtained by solving the dirac equation with vector and scalar potential fields having wood - saxon shapes .",
    "their depths were fitted to the binding energies of the respective states . in ref .",
    "@xcite bound state spinors obtained in the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model  @xcite were also used .",
    "the cross sections for the hypernuclear production were found to be quite different from those calculated previously in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the parameters at the resonance vertices were determined by describing the available data on total and differential cross sections for the elementary process @xmath27h@xmath28 within a similar effective lagrangian model  @xcite , where contributions were included from the @xmath17-channel and @xmath15-channel diagrams , which have as intermediate states @xmath6 and @xmath7 hyperons together with eight of their three - and four - star resonances [ @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 with masses up to 2 gev .",

    "the region for beam momentum ( @xmath38 ) below 2.0 gev / c was found to be dominated by contributions from the @xmath17-channel graphs - the @xmath15-channel terms are dominant only in the region @xmath38 @xmath39 2.5 gev .",

    "the basic production mechanism considered in our work is depicted in fig .  1 , where this reaction proceeds in two steps .",
    "in the first step the @xmath45 production takes place by following the process as described above [ see , fig .",
    "1(a ) ] , while in the second step the @xmath23 hyperon fuses with another proton of the residual nucleus to form the @xmath0 dibaryon .",
    "a similar method was also used earlier in refs .",
    "@xcite in calculations of the production of this particle via @xmath1 .",
    "however , there are some differences between those calculations and the present work . in our method the amplitude for the @xmath46 reaction is calculated by employing the same method as that described in the previous paragraph .",
    "however , @xmath47 is treated as a bound particle and in the calculations of the corresponding amplitude a bound state spinor is used for the initial proton state ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "therefore , the dynamics of the @xmath48 production is intimately related to the wave function of the initial proton bound state [ see fig .",
    "on the other hand , in the procedure of refs .",
    "@xcite , the initial state is described by a product of the target wave function and the amplitude of the @xmath49 reaction .",
    "the latter is determined from a parametrization of the sparsely available experimental zero degree differential cross - section for this reaction [ see fig .",
    "1(a ) ]  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , while the previous calculations were limited to a very light @xmath14he target , we apply our method to @xmath2c .",
    "this makes it possible to compare our cross sections directly to the existing experimental results and to make predictions for future measurements .    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , there may be several higher order processes through which the @xmath0 dibaryon production can proceed .",
    "they lead to the @xmath0 dibaryon via @xmath13 or @xmath50 fusion .",
    "the latter are produced via the following reactions : @xmath51 , or @xmath52 .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the contributions of such terms are not expected to be large and they can be ignored .",
    "therefore , like these authors , we have also neglected such diagrams in our study .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , an alternative scheme of @xmath0 production has been discussed in which a tagged @xmath23 hyperon is first produced on a hydrogen target via the reaction @xmath3 ; it is then slowed down by passing through a moderator .",
    "after moderation , the slow @xmath53 are captured in a second target into an atomic orbit , and the @xmath0 is subsequently produced via , e.g. , the processes , ( @xmath23 p)@xmath54 , ( @xmath23 d)@xmath55 and ( @xmath23@xmath56he)@xmath57 . to ensure that an @xmath0 with sharply defined mass is indeed produced , the @xmath10 and monoenergetic @xmath58 , neutron or triton should be detected in coincidence .",
    "these authors have estimated the branching ratios ( @xmath59 ) of the three @xmath0 formation reactions relative to the total decay widths of the @xmath23 atoms .",
    "it has been found that @xmath59 has a sizable value ( in excess of 0.5 ) for ( @xmath60 ) and ( @xmath23@xmath56he ) atoms if @xmath0 mass ( @xmath61 ) is very close to the @xmath13 threshold .",
    "therefore , these processes have their merit for such values of @xmath61 . however , these estimates of @xmath59 are based on very poorly known amplitudes for the transitions @xmath62 at low momentum and are strongly dependent on the models chosen to calculate them .",
    "the virtue of the @xmath63 reaction studied in this paper is that @xmath0 production occurs through a second order process within a single nuclear target where all the components of the total amplitude can be calculated relatively more reliably . furthermore ,",
    "unlike the @xmath23 atom method , there are no weak decay losses of @xmath23 during moderation to low momentum .",
