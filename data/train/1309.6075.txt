    "the problem of the beginning of the universe in time ",
    "the problem of cosmological singularity ( pcs )  and the problem of invisible components of gravitating matter , dark energy and dark matter , remain as the most principal problems of relativistic cosmology built on the base of general relativity theory ( gr ) .",
    "many attempts were undertaken with the purpose to solve these problems in the framework of gr and existent candidates to quantum gravitation theory ( string theory / m - theory , loop quantum gravity ) as well as different generalizations of gr .",
    "radical ideas connected with the notions of strings , additional spacetime dimensions , spacetime quantization etc . were used .",
    "various hypothetical fields and particles with unusual properties as possible candidates to dark energy and dark matter were discussed in literature .",
    "it should be noted that many existent generalizations of einsteinian gravitation theory are based on ad hoc hypotheses and do not have solid theoretical foundation .    at the same time",
    "there is the gravitation theory built on the base of generally accepted field - theoretical principles including the local gauge invariance principle which is a natural generalization of gr and which offers opportunities to solve its principal problems : the poincar gauge theory of gravity ( pgtg )  the gravitation theory in 4-dimensional physical spacetime with the structure of riemann - cartan continuum @xmath0 .",
    "the formation of pgtg is inseparably connected with works @xcite , from which follows that gravitation theory in riemann - cartan spacetime is a necessary generalization of gr by including the lorentz group ( the group of tetrad lorentz transformations ) to gauge group corresponding to gravitational interaction .",
    "the simplest pgtg is einstein - cartan theory of gravity based on gravitational lagrangian in the form of scalar curvature of @xmath0 @xcite . in the case of spinless matter gravitational equations of einstein - cartan theory",
    "are identical to einstein gravitational equations of gr , and in the case of spinning matter the einstein - cartan theory leads to linear relation between spacetime torsion and spin momentum of gravitating matter . because of this fact the opinion that the torsion is generated by spin momentum of gravitating matter is widely held in literature .",
    "however , by taking into account that the torsion tensor plays the role of gravitational field strength corresponding to subgroup of spacetime translations connected directly with energy - momentum tensor , we can conclude that this fact discusses the degenerate character of einstein - cartan theory .",
    "the situation comes to normal by including to gravitational lagrangian similarly to the theory of yang - mills fields terms quadratic in gauge gravitational field strengths - the curvature and torsion tensors @xcite .    by using sufficiently general expression of gravitational lagrangian of pgtg including both a scalar curvature and quadratic terms in curvature ( @xmath1 ) and torsion ( @xmath2 ) tensors with indefinite parameters isotropic",
    "cosmology was built and investigated in a number of papers ( see refs . 7 - 15 and references herein ) .",
    "it was shown that gravitational interaction in the frame of homogeneous isotropic models ( him ) by certain restrictions on indefinite parameters is changed in comparison with gr and can be repulsive by certain conditions that allow solving the pcs and also to explain the acceleration of cosmological expansion at present epoch without using the notion of dark energy",
    ". from cosmological equations deduced in ref.@xcite follows that gravitational repulsion effect takes place at extreme conditions ( extremely high energy densities and pressures ) at the beginning of cosmological expansion by virtue of existence of limiting ( maximum ) energy density . as a result",
    "all cosmological solutions for him filled with gravitating matter satisfying standard energy conditions are regular , and they contain the compression stage before cosmological expansion stage .",
    "gravitational repulsion effect appears also when energy density in him is very small that leads to cosmological solutions for accelerating universe .",
    "repulsion effect in this case has the vacuum origin because the physical spacetime in the vacuum has the structure of riemann - cartan continuum with de sitter metrics and non - vanishing torsion @xcite .",
    "the change of gravitational interaction in the frame of pgtg in comparison with gr is connected with more complicated structure of physical spacetime , namely with spacetime torsion .",
    "the present paper is devoted to analysis of properties of him for accelerating universe at extreme conditions in the beginning of cosmological expansion .",
    "the principal relations of isotropic cosmology built in the frame of pgtg are given in section 2 .",
    "in the frame of pgtg any him is described by means of three functions of time : the scale factor of robertson - walker metrics @xmath3 and two torsion functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 determining non - vanishing components of torsion tensor @xmath6 @xcite : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , where spatial spherical coordinates are used . then non - vanishing components of curvature tensor are determined by means of the following functions @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the hubble parameter and a dot denotes the differentiation with respect to time .    isotropic cosmology was built by using the following expression of gravitational lagrangian ( definitions and notations of @xcite are used below ) : @xmath13    the lagrangian @xmath14 includes the parameter @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is newton s gravitational constant , the light velocity @xmath17 ) and a number of indefinite parameters : @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "gravitational equations of pgtg corresponding to gravitational lagrangian @xmath14 allow one to obtain cosmological equations generalizing friedmann cosmological equations of gr and equations for torsion functions given in general form in ref .",
    "these equations contain five indefinite parameters : @xmath22 and their mathematical structure and physical consequences depend essentially on restrictions on these parameters . as it was discussed in ref .",
    "14 , the simplest him possessing important physical properties take place if @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the first restriction @xmath23 leads to excluding of higher derivatives of the scale factor @xmath3 from cosmological equations @xcite , and the appearance of limiting energy density in the case of him with two torsion functions is connected directly with the second restriction @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "we also give the main relations of isotropic cosmology by using these restrictions on indefinite parameters .",
    "cosmological equations generalizing friedmann cosmological equations of gr take the following form : @xmath25,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath26,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the energy density , @xmath28 is the pressure , the parameter @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) has inverse dimension of energy density and @xmath31 .",
