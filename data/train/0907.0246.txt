    "irac images revealed a bright mid - infrared source whose brightness had not varied significantly over the four years preceding the outburst .",
    "the progenitor of sn2008s thus appeared to be enshrouded in a cloud of its own dust . from a 440  k blackbody fit to the ir fluxes , they estimated a pre - explosion luminosity of 3.5@xmath8  l@xmath0 and a modest mass of @xmath910  m@xmath0 for the progenitor star , close to the poorly defined boundary between agb and supergiant stars .",
    "they suggested that sn  2008s was an electron capture sn event by such a star .",
    "wesson et al . ( 2008 ) reported irac and mips _ spitzer _ observations of sn  2008s that were serendipitously obtained only 5 days after its discovery , fitting the photometry with a 500k modified blackbody with a luminosity of 2.1@xmath10  l@xmath0 .",

    "( 2009 ) , if a supernova event has not occurred , a relatively luminous star should be detectable once the 2008 outburst has faded sufficiently .",
    "the discovery that sn2008s had a dust - enshrouded progenitor led thompson et al .",
    "( 2008 ) to propose that it and two other recently discovered extragalactic transient sources were members of a new class of transient , formed when stars located near the upper mass limit for agb evolution go through a self - obscured phase shortly before exploding as electron capture sne .",
    "depending on the amount of dust produced in this phase , and the proportion of stars for which the phase occurs , objects such as sn  2008s could potentially contribute to the substantial amounts of dust observed in young high - redshift galaxies ( e.g. bertoldi et al .",
    "2003 ) , given that dust production by relatively massive stars ( @xmath135  m@xmath4 ) appears to be required in order to match the short timescales over which dust is inferred to have formed in the early universe ( morgan & edmunds 2003 ; dwek , galliano & jones 2009 )    the utility of light echoes from circumstellar dust as a probe into the prior evolution of supernova progenitors has been discussed and exploited by e.g. bode & evans ( 1980 ) , graham et al .",

    "we used this luminosity as a starting point from which to construct increasingly detailed models of the dust shell surrounding sn2008s , experimenting with both amorphous carbon and silicate grains , as well as mixtures of the two .",

    "we began with the simplest case of a homogeneous constant density shell , obtaining a match to the observed mid - ir fluxes by varying the inner and outer radii , r@xmath20 and r@xmath21 , and the dust mass .",
    "we assumed that the central source had a luminosity of 3@xmath2210@xmath23l@xmath0 and a temperature of 10000k .",
    "the high visual optical depth of the dust shell being considered means that the resulting sed is insensitive to the choice of central star temperature . for the amorphous carbon models",

    "these inner and outer radii are similar to those estimated by botticella et al .",
    "( 2009 ) for the progenitor s dust shell .",
    "we then constructed models in which the dust density in the shell was inversely proportional to the square of the radius .",
    "this would be expected if the dust was forming continuously in an outflow from the star .",
    "we varied the inner and outer radii , and the total dust mass in the shell , to obtain a good fit .",
    "we found that a standard mrn dust size distribution with grain sizes between 0.005 and 0.25@xmath14 m could not reproduce the steepness of the observed sed between 3.6 and 4.5@xmath14 m .",
    "prieto et al . ( 2008 ) suggested that the shape of the sed required the presence of large dust grains , and we found an improved fit by using an mrn distribution with grain sizes between 0.1 and 0.5@xmath14 m .",
    "the match to our observations is quite sensitive to the adopted inner radius , which is found to be 85  au .",
    "unfortunately , the constraints on the outer radius of the dust shell are weak , as this only significantly affects the sed at wavelengths of @xmath910@xmath14 m and longer .",
    "we therefore considered two alternative physically plausible models . in the first case , we considered a dust shell with an outer radius 5 times the inner radius . for an expansion velocity of @xmath2870  km  s@xmath5 ( consistent with the late - time [ ca  ii ] line widths ; see section 3.4 )",
    ", such an outer radius would correspond to an age of less than 30 years .",
    "thompson et al . ( 2008 ) estimated that the dust - enshrouded phase for a star similar to the progenitor of sn  2008s could last up to ten thousand years .",
    "we therefore constructed alternative models of the dust shell with the same inner radius but with outer radii of 20,000  au and 100,000  au , corresponding respectively to the distances from the star reached by a 70kms@xmath5 outflow after 1,500 years and 7,500 years .",
    "all of these models gave a good fit to the observed sed , and lie below the upper limit to the 24-@xmath14 m flux .",
    "the total dust mass is 1.2@xmath2210@xmath27m@xmath0 for r@xmath21 = 425  au , and 3.49@xmath2210@xmath29m@xmath0 for r@xmath21 = 100,000  au .",
    "henceforth we refer to the model with r@xmath21 = 425  au as the ` small ' dust shell , and the r@xmath21 = 100,000  au model as the ` large ' dust shell .",
    "figure  [ progenitor_models ] compares the seds predicted by these two models with the prieto et al .",
    "( 2008 ) optical and infrared observations of the progenitor .",
    "we also investigated whether silicate dust shells could account for the observed sed of the progenitor of sn  2008s . using the ` astronomical silicate ' optical constants of draine & lee ( 1984 ) , the dust mass required to approximately match the sed was considerably higher than for amorphous carbon grains , due to the greater transparency in the visible and near - ir of silicate grains .",
    "a full match to the observations was impossible because the dust masses required to match the steepness of the sed between 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath14 m give rise to a strong , broad silicate absorption feature at 10  @xmath14 m , which is inconsistent with the observed 8@xmath14 m flux .",
    "silicate dust shells with larger outer radii of 20,000au or 100,000  au also predicted a 24-@xmath14 m flux much higher than the observed upper limit for the progenitor of sn2008s ( figure  [ progenitor_models ] ) .    with silicaceous dust",

    "the removal of the inner edge of the shell would then expose more dust to the intense radiation field , and dust destruction could proceed rapidly outwards . to investigate",
    "how much of the shell could have been destroyed in this way , we ran a series of models with successively larger inner radii .",
    "a sublimation temperature of 2200k is often assumed for amorphous carbon .",

    "using this hollowed shell and varying only the source parameters , it was not possible to match the day 17 observations , as the optical depth was too high and gave too much reprocessed radiation .",

    "in which the dust density is proportional to r@xmath1 , each annulus of constant thickness contains the same mass .",
    "thus , hollowing out the shell to a new inner radius of 1250  au only removes a small fraction of the original mass .",
    "however , the optical depth is determined by the column density of the dust , proportional to r@xmath41 - r@xmath42 for an r@xmath1 shell , and so a dust shell hollowed out by a radiation flash can have a much lower optical depth but a similar mass to the pre - existing shell .",

    "the day  175 h@xmath46 intermediate component then yields an expansion velocity of 320  km  s@xmath5 , while the narrow h@xmath46 component and the forbidden [ ca  ii ] 7291 , 7324     lines , which may originate from lower density material , further out in the wind , yield expansion velocities of 70 - 80  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the intermediate - width velocity component may correspond to material in the innermost regions of the wind that has been accelerated by the radiation pressure pulse from the outburst .",
    "our analysis of sn2008s shows that both the progenitor sed and the day 17 and day 180 seds can be self - consistently fitted by the same r@xmath1 density distribution of amorphous carbon grains , whose pre - outburst inner shell radius of r@xmath20 = 85  au increased to 1250  au after the outburst , due to grain evaporation by the light flash . as a result of this vaporisation of the innermost grains , the visual optical depth of the dust shell ( @xmath47 r@xmath41 - r@xmath42 ) decreased from 13.5 to 0.76 , but",
    "the total mass of dust ( @xmath47 r@xmath21 - r@xmath20 ) decreased from its intial value by less than 2% .",
    "for an expansion velocity of 70  km  s@xmath5 , our derived parameters imply a dust mass - loss rate of 5.2@xmath6  m@xmath4  yr@xmath5 from the progenitor of sn  2008s .",
    "if the gas to dust mass ratio in the outflow is 100 - 200 , then this corresponds to an overall mass - loss rate of 0.5 - 1.0@xmath3  m@xmath4  yr@xmath5 .",
    "matsuura et al . ( 2009 ) find a high fraction of carbon - rich stars amongst the most luminous agb stars in the lmc , with over ten such stars having inferred mass - loss rates of 0.5 - 1.0@xmath3  m@xmath4  yr@xmath5 , similar to that inferred here for the progenitor of sn  2008s .",
    "the total mass of the dust shell around sn  2008s could be larger than the 3.5@xmath2210@xmath29m@xmath0 in our dust model of outer radius 100,000  au , since the total mass is proportional to the outer radius , which is not constrained by the available data . for our derived dust density at 1250",
    "au of 1.1@xmath48  g  cm@xmath29 , the gas particle density n@xmath49 there is ( 0.5 - 1.0)@xmath50  cm@xmath29 , implying that n@xmath49 = ( 1 - 2)@xmath51  cm@xmath29 at 10  au , the effective emitting radius of the central source on both day 17 and day 180 , and ( 1 - 2)@xmath52  cm@xmath29 at 85  au , the presumed dust condensation radius of the progenitor wind .",
    "the latter density is similar to that inferred by cherchneff et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for the region of dust formation in late - type carbon - rich wolf - rayet outflows .    while botticella et al .",
    "( 2009 ) adopted a model in which sn  2008s had undergone episodic mass loss and a sharp change in dust chemistry , fitting the pre - outburst sed with silicate grains and the post - outburst sed with carbon grains , we find that a featureless grain type such as amorphous carbon is required to fit both the pre - outburst and post - outburst seds of sn  2008s .",
    "this appears surprising at first sight , given that outflows from cool supergiants or super - agb stars might be expected to be oxygen - rich , thus favoring the formation of silicate grains .",
    "however , we find silicate models to be completely incompatible with the observed optical and ir seds , producing a strong 10-@xmath14 m absorption feature for high-@xmath30 pre - outburst models and a strong 10-@xmath14 m emission feature for lower-@xmath30 post - outburst models .",
    "comparison of our models for the july 2008 sed of sn  2008s with the _ spitzer _ and michelle mid - ir photometry and the _ spitzer _ irs spectrum constrain any silicate grain component to contribute significantly less than 10% of the overall dust mass .",
    "since cool m supergiant stars always show silicate dust features in the mid - ir , the absence of silicates in the outflow around sn  2008s and its progenitor may count as evidence against a supergiant precursor and in favor of a super - agb star progenitor .",
    "surface carbon enrichment of agb stars via the 3rd dredge - up can produce carbon stars .",
    "however , at the higher mass end of the agb mass distribution , envelope burning is predicted to convert dredged - up carbon to nitrogen , lowering the c / o ratio below unity and allowing silicate grains to form . given the absence of silicate grains around sn  2008s , a mechanism to suppress or bypass envelope burning in super - agb stars may be necessary , perhaps related to the severe mass loss stripping of the envelope .",

    "the progenitor of sn2008s is estimated to have had an initial mass in the range 610m@xmath0 ( prieto et al .",
    "2008 ; botticella et al .",
    "thompson et al . ( 2008 ) suggested that a dust - enshrouded phase may occur during the lives of a large fraction of all massive stars , which may indicate that this type of transient could be a significant additional source of dust in the early universe .",
    "thompson et al . estimated that the dust - enshrouded phase of sn  2008s - type objects could last for up to 2@xmath8 years , in which case our derived dust mass - loss rate of 5.2@xmath6  m@xmath4  yr@xmath5 implies that up to 0.01  m@xmath4 of dust could be ejected , along with 1 - 2  m@xmath4 of gas , a significant fraction of the total stellar mass .",
    "an ejected dust mass of 0.01  m@xmath4 is within a factor of two of the largest dust mass derived by any of the recent studies of young ccsne ejecta ( sn  2003gd ; sugerman et al .",
    "up to 1.0  m@xmath4 of cold dust was claimed to be present in the young galactic supernova remnants cas  a and kepler by morgan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and dunne et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , although their analysis was disputed by krause et al .",
    "recently dunne et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and gomez et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have returned to this issue with new observations , from which they still infer 0.1 - 1.0  m@xmath4 of cold dust in each remnant .    since the dust around sn  2008s is definitely not silicaceous , and is consistent with amorphous carbon , the atoms in the dust will have been freshly synthesised , with the outflow enriching the ism in this dust component .",
    "dwek et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have estimated that the 2@xmath40  m@xmath4 of dust in the @xmath53 galaxy j114816.64 + 5251 must have been created within a timescale of 400  myr .",
    "given that the lifetime of a 5  m@xmath4 star is only 100  myr ( maeder & meynet 1989 ) and that standard initial mass functions favour lower mass stars over high mass stars , then with some initial heavy element seeding from massive ccsne there could be scope for agb or super - agb stars with initial masses between 6 and 10  m@xmath4 , of which the progenitor of sn  2008s appears to be an example , to make a contribution to the dust enrichment of such galaxies .",
    "we estimate the possible contribution of such stars to the dust content of j114816.64 + 5251 as follows : for a salpeter imf with limits of 0.1 and 120  m@xmath4 , 0.20 per cent of stars have masses between 6 and 10 m@xmath4 , while a further 0.29 per cent have masses between 4 and 6 m@xmath4 .",
    "the star formation history of j114816.64 + 5251 is uncertain , with evidence for a current star formation rate of up to 3000 m@xmath0  yr@xmath5 ( dwek et al .",
    "2007 ) . as they noted , such a high sfr almost certainly could not have been sustained for 400 myr ; @xmath9 200 m@xmath0  yr@xmath5 is likely to be a more representative average .",
    "this would result in a total stellar mass of 8@xmath2210@xmath54 m@xmath0 , giving 6.6@xmath2210@xmath55 stars with masses between 4 and 6 m@xmath0 and 4.5@xmath2210@xmath55 stars with masses between 6 and 10 m@xmath0 .",
    "if each star in both these mass ranges produce 0.01 m@xmath0 of dust , then their total contribution would be 6.6@xmath2210@xmath36 and 4.5@xmath2210@xmath36 m@xmath0 for the low and high mass ranges respectively , before dust destruction is accounted for .",
    "a similar calculation can be made for ` normal ' supernovae ; assuming that all stars with initial masses greater than 8 m@xmath0 explode as supernovae , and that each produces 0.01  m@xmath0 of dust ( e.g. sugerman et al .",
    "2006 ) , their total contribution before accounting for dust destruction would be 6.0@xmath2210@xmath36  m@xmath0 .",
    "thus , the amount of dust produced by sn2008s - type events could be comparable to the contribution of ` normal ' supernovae .",
    "for both types of object , these results are sensitive to the lower bound of the imf ; raising the imf lower mass limit from 0.1  m@xmath4 to 0.2  m@xmath0 would approximately double the quantity of dust produced .",
    "another parameter that these estimates are sensitive to is the dust lifetime against destruction .",
    "some fraction of the dust produced by both sources would be destroyed during the galaxy s 400 myr life .",
    "the lifetime of dust in this environment , and hence the surviving fraction , is highly uncertain ; for a typical milky way dust lifetime of 5@xmath2210@xmath55 years ( dwek et al .",
    "2007 ) , the surviving fraction after 400myr would be 70% . for star formation bursts as high as 3000 m@xmath0",
    "yr@xmath5 , dust lifetimes could be as short as 25  myr ( dwek et al .",
    "however , such high star formation rates are unlikely to be sustained for periods longer than this , and sn ejecta dust from the massive stars that resulted from the burst would seem more at risk from destruction than dust from longer - lived high - mass agb stars , which would be further from the sites of active star formation .",
    "even for a dust lifetime of 500  myr , with 70% of grains surviving over 400  myr , 4 - 10  m@xmath0 agb stars and sne would respectively account for only 3.9 and 2.1 per cent of the 2@xmath2210@xmath55  m@xmath0 of dust observed in j114816.64 + 5251 .",
    "it seems difficult for either agb stars or core collapse sne to account for the masses of dust inferred for such galaxies , if current estimates for the galaxy dust masses , and for the dust injection rates by stars , are correct .",
    "if sn2008s was not a bona fide supernova event , then a star will remain at the centre of the dust shell , and could presumably explode later as a supernova .",
    "we investigated whether a subsequent supernova could vaporise the dust shell , using grids formed from simple geometric expansion of our derived dust distribution . adopting a representative type  ii supernova peak luminosity of 10@xmath56l@xmath0",
    ", we find that if a supernova occurred in the very near future , then dust within about 7500au of the star would be vaporised , reducing @xmath30 from 0.76 to 0.15 .",
    "the surviving dust shell would then have a mass of 3.2@xmath2210@xmath29  m@xmath0 , still 93% of the initial value .",
    "if the supernova does not occur within the next 500 years , then a 70kms@xmath5 outflow velocity will have carried the inner edge of the shell beyond the vaporisation radius for this luminosity , and the entire dust shell would survive the supernova light flash .",
