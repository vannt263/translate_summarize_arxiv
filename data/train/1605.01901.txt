    "intensity of involvement among actors in a social network and the types of actions and interactions that arise between them are a long active topic in sociological research .",
    "the analysis of group structures has started with the study of dyads and triads that was pioneered by german sociologist georg simmel at the end of the nineteenth century @xcite . in network analysis , the importance of triads has long been emphasized in many research studies , including the highly influential work of granovetter @xcite and , more recently , the work of watts and strogatz @xcite , where the notion of clustering ( formation of many triangles in networks ) is an integral part of the analysis .",
    "thus , both social and network analysis that represent actors as networks nodes and their interactions as ( un)directed links have shown that the network structural properties like reciprocity and cycles are very important when trying to explain processes like information spreading and network evolution",
    ".    however , retaining the perspective on different connections , i.e. granovetter s strong and weak ties , sheds additional light on the nature of connections between actors and provides deeper understanding of the triads formations and network clustering .",
    "thus , deeper understanding of the network properties , and therefore the processes that run on top of it , can be gained if it is viewed as a collection of multiple types of links wherein each set of link types represents a separate layer of the network .",
    "this multilayered representation has led to the introduction of the concept of multiplex networks which refers to systems in which nodes are connected through more than one type of edges , and therefore , belong to multiple interacting and co - evolving networks .",
    "the importance of multiplex networks in sociology has been emphasized by many scholars . in the seminal treatment of multiple networks as the foundation of social structure ,",
    "white , boorman and breiger @xcite and boorman and white @xcite argued that the patterning and interweaving of different types of ties are needed to describe and characterize social structures .",
    "it has been demonstrated that multiplexity is critical to diverse phenomena , such as the mobilization of social movements @xcite , the consolidation of political power @xcite , the emergence of trust in economic relationships @xcite , the creation of social bonds within civic networks @xcite , and the organization of party coalitions @xcite .",
    "multiplexity has been studied to understand scientific collaboration @xcite , structural logic of intra - organizational networks @xcite , formation of ties featuring both an economic and a social component in inter - organizational networks @xcite , and formation of relationships among producers in the multiplex triads @xcite .",
    "multiplex networks have also been recently subject of particularly intense research by the network science and physics communities .",
    "szell , lambiotte , and thurner @xcite worked on correlations and overlap between different types of links and demonstrated the tendency of individuals to play different roles in different networks .",
    "algorithmic detection of tightly connected groups of nodes known as communities in multiplex networks was studied in @xcite . a framework for growing multiplexes where a node can belong to a different networks",
    "was developed by nicosia et al @xcite , while kim and goh @xcite studied the possibility of growth of coevolving layers that can shape the network structure and showed analytically and numerically that the coevolution can induce strong degree correlations across layers , as well as modulate degree distributions .",
    "evolutionary game dynamics on structured populations in which individuals take part in several layers of networks of interactions simultaneously which accounts for the different kind of social ties each individual has was studied by gomez et al @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we aim to study social relations among actors ( strong and weak ties ) as they appear in real life face - to face ( offline ) and virtual via social network sites ( online ) communications using the apparatus of multiplex network analysis / analytics .",
    "real data was collected using an online survey / questionnaire given to two groups of students ( two classroom based social networks ) .",
    "the students answers were used to map their own perception of strong vs. weak offline and online connections , thus constructing several offline and online directed friendship networks that constitute the layers of our multiplex network .",
    "the primary goal of this research is to study the interrelationship of different social structures represented as multiplex networks .",
    "for this reason , we develop normalized actor characteristics for multiplex networks , including metrics for dyads ( such as reciprocity ) and triads .",
    "we found that normalized reciprocity , three cycles , and triplets of an actor can be expressed using an unifying framework that is based on the comparison of two sets associated with the actor : the set of her / his friends - out links and the set of actors that consider her / him as a friend - in links . by extending these metrics for multiplex networks",
    ", we were able to observe the relationship of strong and weak ties in the offline and online space . analyzing the collected data from two groups of undergraduate students we found that in offline communication strong and weak ties are ( almost ) equally presented , while in online communication weak ties are dominant .",
    "moreover , weak ties are a lot less reciprocal than strong ties . however , while reciprocities are preserved across layers , the triads ( measured using normalized three cycles and triplets ) are not significant on the different layers of the multiplex network .",
    "this is the outline of the paper .",
    "first , we describe the participants involved in the study and the procedure for collecting data .",
    "next , we address the network endogenous ( structural ) and exogenous factors .",
    "endogenous factors include graph characteristics such as reciprocity , three - cycles , transitive triplets , together with their normalized versions , as well as their generalizations for multiplex graphs .",
    "the section results summarizes our findings regarding the offline and online multiplex networks generated by collecting the data described in the section materials and methods .",
    "we conclude the paper with the section conclusions where we also discuss our future work .",
    "participants in this study were two groups of undergraduate students enrolled on two courses given at the faculty of computer science and engineering within the cyril and methodius university in skopje , macedonia . during the courses there was a dedicated lecture to explain the study and it s objectives in which the students were informed about the research experiment and only those who agreed to participate were part of the experiment .",
    "thus , the two groups represent two social networks of students that attend the same class during one semester of their studies .",
    "the total number of students in the first group , group 1 , is 171 , out of which 153 voluntarily participated in the study .",
    "the gender distribution is almost equal ; there were 86 female and 85 male students .",
    "the total number of students in the second group , group 2 , is 150 ( 118 male , 32 female ) , while only 80 participated in the at the end we summarize our findings regarding the offline and online multiplex networks generated from the collected datastudy .",
    "the students age for both groups ranges from 19 years to 22 years .",
    "additional data was also collected for each student via the university online electronic course enrollment system ( such as : gender , study program , gpa , accumulated credits ) .",
    "the online survey was developed by the research team .",
    "each student ( that participated in the study ) was asked to select from the presented list of classmates those with whom she / he was engaged in face - to - face ( offline ) communication and facebook ( online ) communication .",
    "each chosen contact was described as weak or strong according to the student s own perception by the means of pre - defined categories for frequency of communication . in the case of face - to - face communication a contact ( tie )",
    "is considered to be strong if the frequency of communication is higher than 5 interactions per month , while it is considered as weak contact ( tie ) if the number of interactions is larger than once in 3 months , but less than 5 interactions per month . when considering the online communication , strong contacts ( ties ) are those with whom the student interacts more than five times per week , while a weak contact ( tie ) is the one with whom there was facebook activity more than once a month , but less than five times per week",
    ". facebook was chosen as the online social network representative since it s use is extremely wide spread among the population .",
    "graphs provide a powerful primitive for modeling data in social science",
    ". nodes usually represent real world objects and edges indicate relationships between objects . in sociology",
    ", nodes may have attributes associated with them and graphs may contain many different types of relationships .",
    "the node attributes are used to describe the features of the objects that the nodes represent .",
    "for example , a node representing a student may have attributes that represent the student s gender and department .",
    "different types of edges in a graph correspond to different types of relationships between nodes , such as friends and classmates relationships .",
    "here we study friendship relations among @xmath0 actors : the existence of a tie @xmath1 will be described as @xmath2 calling @xmath3 a friend .",
    "the ties are represented as binary variables , denoted by @xmath4 . a tie from actor @xmath2 to actor @xmath3 , @xmath1 ,",
    "is either present or absent ( @xmath4 then having values 1 and 0 , respectively ) .",
    "the tie variables constitute the network , represented by its @xmath5 adjacency matrix @xmath6 $ ] ( self - ties are excluded ) .",
    "the graph is directed , where each tie @xmath1 has a sender @xmath2 , who will also be referred to as ego , and a receiver @xmath3 , referred to as alter , as it is common in social network analysis .",
    "we model different types of relationships among actors using the concept of multiplex graphs . in sociology ,",
    "multiplex graphs ( networks ) refer to the case when nodes ( actors ) are connected through more than one type of ( socially relevant ) ties . in mathematics ,",
    "such graphs are also called multi - graphs ( a multi - graph is a graph that is allowed to have multiple edges , that is , edges that have the same end nodes ) . we give a definition of multiplex graphs adapted for the study reported in this paper .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the set of nodes ; nodes are connected via @xmath8 different type of connections ( ties ) .",
    "each type of connection ( together with the set of nodes ) forms a ( directed ) graph with @xmath0 vertices .",
    "we denote with @xmath9 the graph which represents the connection type @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the set of @xmath10-type ties , @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 $ ] be @xmath5 adjacency matrix of the graph @xmath14 .",
    "a multiplex graph @xmath15 is then defined as a collection of all graphs @xmath14 and all edge - aggregated graphs of the form @xmath16 , where @xmath17 .",
    "we assume that the case @xmath18 is not excluded and thus write @xmath19 for the multiplex graph @xmath15 . in the study discussed here ,",
    "different types of edges correspond to the four types of friendship relations : online weak or strong connections and offline weak or strong connections .      in order to introduce an unifying framework for discussing graph characteristics",
    ", we use the jaccard index , also known as jaccard similarity coefficient .",
    "it measures the similarity between finite sets and is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sets : @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the cardinality of the set @xmath22 .",
    "if @xmath23 and @xmath24 are both empty , @xmath25 is defined as 1 .",
    "note that @xmath26 the jaccard distance , which measures dissimilarity between sets and is a metric on the collection of all finite sets , is complementary to the jaccard coefficient and is obtained by subtracting the jaccard coefficient from 1 . using jaccard index to introduce various actor - based characteristics",
    "is based on the following observation .",
    "let @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "then @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we consider a number of social network characteristics ; those depending only on the network are called structural or endogenous characteristics , while characteristics depending on externally given attributes are called covariate or exogenous characteristics .",
    "let @xmath31 be a directed graph and let @xmath2 be an arbitrary node ( actor ) in the graph .",
    "we denote @xmath32 and @xmath33 for the @xmath34-in - neighborhood of @xmath2 and @xmath34-out - neighborhood of @xmath2 , respectively , i.e. , for the set of vertices from where vertex @xmath2 can be reached and for the set of vertices that can be reached from @xmath2 in @xmath34 steps ( using @xmath34 directed edges ) .",
    "more formally , these sets are defined as @xmath35 the general case of arbitrary @xmath34 will be discussed elsewhere , here we consider only to the case when @xmath36 .",
    "for @xmath36 we use the shorter notations @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in other words",
    ", we consider the 1-hop - neighbor sets of node @xmath2 defined as : @xmath39 if the existence of a tie @xmath1 is being interpreted as @xmath3 is a friend of @xmath2 , then @xmath40 is the set of @xmath2 s friends , while @xmath41 is the set of nodes that consider @xmath2 as their friend . for the cardinalities of these sets , we write @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , @xmath44 is the number of @xmath2 s friends and @xmath45 is the number of nodes that consider @xmath2 as their friend .",
    "these two metrics are known as activity , i.e. tendency to establish friendships , and popularity , i.e. ability to gain friends , in social science . in this paper , we analyse several graph characteristics that can all be expressed using the jaccard similarity index for a given pair of node sets .",
    "out of the many different possible characteristics , here the focus is set on those that we consider most relevant for this study : reciprocity , three - cycles , and triplets .",
    "_ reciprocity _  one of the most basic properties of social networks is reciprocity , represented by the number of reciprocated ties of actor @xmath2 and defined as @xmath46 , which can be rewritten as @xmath47 here we consider normalized reciprocity defied as : @xmath48 the normalized reciprocity enables one to decide on the quantity of reciprocated ties when compared to the total number of ties of both actors .",
    "this normalization provides a perspective and places the phenomenon of reciprocity into context by comparing it to the total number of possibilities for reciprocated ties under the given circumstances .",
    "_ three - cycles _  next to reciprocity , an essential feature in most social networks is transitivity , or transitive closure which is represented by two metrics : three - cycles and triplets .",
    "a cycle of length 3 in a given graph is defined as a sub - graph that consists of a sequence of directed edges @xmath49 which connect a sequence of vertices @xmath50 , all distinct from one another .",
    "we discuss the first metric , three - cycles , defined as the number of three - cycles an actor @xmath2 is involved in , that is @xmath51 we introduce a normalized characteristic for the number of three - cycles an actor @xmath2 is involved in as follows : @xmath52 @xmath53 is the number of the common neighbors for both @xmath2 and @xmath54 or , the number of @xmath2 s friends that consider @xmath54 to be a friend as well .",
    "the jaccard index between these two sets @xmath40 and @xmath55 reflects how similar these sets are in terms of common versus non - common friends .",
    "moreover , @xmath56 is the number of three - cycles that actor @xmath2 is involved in .",
    "therefore , by summarizing the jaccard indexes @xmath57 for all @xmath58 one can obtain a measure ( metric ) @xmath59 that represents the status of common versus non - common friends of @xmath2 in the graph when considered in terms of transitive three - cycles .    _ transitive triplets _  a transitive triplet of length 3 in a given graph is a sub - graph that consists of a sequence of directed edges @xmath60 and @xmath61 which connect a sequence of vertices @xmath50 that are all distinct from one another .",
    "recall , the metric triplets is defined as the number of triplets an actor @xmath2 is involved in , that is @xmath62 in a similar fashion as for the three - cycles , one can define normalized metric for the number of triplets in the graph : @xmath63 note that the normalized reciprocity , normalized transitive triplets , and normalized three - cycles are related to reciprocity , transitive triplets , and three - cycles , respectively - quantities that are commonly used in social science and graph theory .",
    "the fact , shown here , that they can be expressed with jaccard similarity index not only brings novel understanding of these quantities , but also suggests how they can be extended for multiplex networks , which will be done in the next section",
    ". however , take into consideration that while using the jaccard similarity index to express the network characteristics , we define it as 0 when both considered sets are empty in order to reflect the social aspects of the interpretation , i.e. two nodes that have no friends at all are not reciprocated and are not part of any triplets or cycles .",
    "when considering a multiplex graph wherein @xmath10 and @xmath64 ( @xmath65 is not excluded ) represent two types of social relationships , the normalized reciprocity , normalized three - cycles , and normalized transitive triplets can be generalized as : @xmath66 by using these metrics we can analyze how different types of links interact and form mixed dyad and triad formations . recalling",
    "that in the general case a multiplex graph can consist of several different layers , the multiplex - graph extension of the reciprocity , cycles and triplets metrics enables us to study what type of links are stronger than others , as well as how the network characteristics change when considering only a subset of all existing interrelations among its nodes .",
    "we also consider the following two characteristics called overlapping indexes and defined as : @xmath67 these two metrics are introduced in order to create a contrasting view compared to the normalized multiplex graph characteristics as they are defined above . by analyzing the jaccard similarity of sets of links for a given node that belong to different layers of the multiplex graph , we are able to infer the consistency of the relationship intensity for different types of links . in other words",
    ", does the node have the tendency to have different types of relationship with the same set of friends in different environments ( for example , online and offline environment in our study case ) .",
    "we argue that the out overlapping index shows the node activity in creating and maintaining different types of links , while the in overlapping index represents the node popularity , i.e. ability to gain different types of relationships .",
    "nodes in a graph may have a set of associated attributes , also called exogenous actor covariates . in order to emphasize the completeness of the approach , in this section",
    "we show that our unified framework based on the jaccard similarity index can also be used for the analysis of the exogenous characteristics of the multiplex graph .",
    "the results for the exogenous characteristics will be presented elsewhere .",
    "let @xmath68 be the set of attributes associated to the node @xmath2 .",
    "there are two basic characteristics for the actor @xmath2 : the out - attributes characteristic , measuring whether actors with higher similarity - index values tend to nominate more friends and hence have a higher out - degree ; the in - attributes characteristic , measuring whether actors with higher similarity - index values will tend to be nominated by many others and hence have higher in - degrees .",
    "these two characteristics are defined as @xmath69 which will be compared to the average un - networked similarity value computed as @xmath70 the characteristic @xmath71 measures similarity of attributes of the pair of end - nodes @xmath2 and @xmath3 for all the friends of @xmath2 , that is , for all nodes in the set @xmath40 .",
    "the characteristic @xmath72 measures similarity of attributes of the pair of end - nodes @xmath2 and @xmath3 for those @xmath3 that consider @xmath2 as a friend , that is , for all nodes in the set @xmath41 .",
    "the quantities ( [ eq - eq ] ) and ( [ eq - al ] ) can be extended for multiplex networks as @xmath73 with this extension once can also analyze the similarity of the attributes for different pairs of nodes that are connected across different layers of the multiplex network .",
    "therefore , these metrics provide insight into how different types of links influence the attribute based node similarity .",
    "[ fig-1 ]        let @xmath74 be the set of all students enrolled on a given course ( group ) .",
    "for each group of students , there are four distinct directed graphs that have been generated based on the answers collected from the online survey : offline / online social network with strong ties and offline / online social network with weak ties , defined as : @xmath75 from these four ( basic ) graphs , five more aggregated graphs are constructed : @xmath76    two multiplex networks are studied for two groups .",
    "each network consists of nine layers or nine sets of ties : four basic - strong off , weak off , strong on , and weak on and five aggregated sets - strong , weak , on , off , and all , as described with the given equations . in fig .",
    "1 a partial visual representation of the multiplex network for group 2 is presented aiming to conceptualize the different types of links in each layer together with the possible ways for aggregation .    [ tab-1 ]    .*basic graph characteristics for all layers in the multiplex graph that represents the social interrelations between the students from group 1 * [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "by studying friendship relations among students enrolled on two different courses represented using a multiplex structure , a number of interesting conclusions regarding the strength of online and offline ties can be drawn : ( 1 ) strong ties are preferred in face - to - face ( offline ) communications ; ( 2 ) weak ties are equally presented in online and offline communications ; ( 3 ) in offline communication , strong and weak ties are ( almost ) equally included ; ( 4 ) in online communication weak ties are dominant ; ( 5 ) weak ties ( in three layers of the multiplex network : weak offline , weak online , and weak ) are much less reciprocal than strong ties ; ( 6 ) dyads ( that is , reciprocities ) are preserved , however triads ( measured with normalized three cycles and triplets ) are not significant in different layers of a multiplex network ; ( 7 ) activity and popularity patterns for some layers of the multiplex network are significant : out - degree and in - degree friends in one layer could also be out - degree and in - degree friends in another layer .",
    "these conclusions are supported by the data obtained from both groups .",
    "the number and consistency of the drawn conclusions have confirmed that by approaching the problem of different interrelationships between actors as a multiplex network problem , one can gain useful insight on the importance of each type of link within the social network as a whole , as well as on the interaction and overlapping between different link types , especially in the offline / online ( real / virtual ) environments as was our case of study .    in the future",
    ", we plan to study how exogenous characteristics influence the structure of the multiplex network and how the network structure dominates the actors ( students ) characteristics and their temporal evolution .",
    "in particular , we will address questions on : how student grades are distributed ; students commitment and progress to the studies ; how one could empower the students to obtain better grades or determine their specific areas of interest with greater success .",
    "are the students with better grades and habits more central to the network or not , and how changing the placement of these individuals could influence the structure of the network ?"
