    "we consider emission from the whole volume behind an adiabatic highly relativistic spherical blast wave expanding into a cold and uniform medium .",
    "the hydrodynamics is described by the blandford - mckee ( 1976 denoted bm hereafter ) self similar solution . for typical parameters , the evolution becomes adiabatic fairly early , about an hour after the initial burst ( @xcite , granot , piran & sari 1998a and 1998b , hereafter gpsa and gpsb , respectively ) .",
    "the bm solution is valid from this time , and as long as @xmath0 ( kobayashi et .",
    "al . 1998 ) , typically a few months after the burst .",
    "we assume that @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the peak frequency and @xmath3 is the self absorption frequency , which is reasonable for the first few months .",
    "the dominant radiation emission mechanism is assumed to be synchrotron radiation , while compton scattering and electron cooling are ignored .",
    "we denote quantities measured in the local rest frame of the matter with a prime , while quantities without a prime are measured in the observer frame .",
    "we assume that the energy of the electrons is everywhere a constant fraction of the internal energy : @xmath4 , and consider a power law electron distribution : @xmath5 for @xmath6 . the magnetic field is also assumed to hold a constant fraction of the internal energy : @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the energy density of the magnetic field .",
    "alternative magnetic field models were considered in gpsa and gpsb , and we obtained that our results are not sensitive to the assumptions on the magnetic field .",

    "a thin bright ring appears on the outer edge of the image , while the center is much dimmer ( only a few percent of the maximal surface brightness ) . for @xmath10",
    "the surface brightness at the center is @xmath11 of the maximal surface brightness , and @xmath12 of the average surface brightness . for @xmath13",
    "the surface brightness at the center of the image is @xmath14 of its average value , resulting in an almost uniform disk .",
    "the light curve and spectra of an afterglow are flat near the peak .",
    "the exact shape , and the value of the peak frequency and peak flux depend on the values of the physical parameters of the burst ( see gpsa ) . in figure [ light_curve ]",
    "we see the peak in the optical light curve of grb970508 ( sokolov et al .",
    "1997 , metzger et al .",
    "1997 ) , with three theoretical light curves .",
    "these light curves are for @xmath15 , which corresponds to the power law decay that follows the peak , and differ by the values of the remaining parameters .",
    "it is quit evident from figure [ light_curve ] that the shape of the optical peak displayed by grb970508 is not accounted for by the theoretical light curve arising from the model we used , and a different explanation should be considered .",
    "= 8.8 cm    the observed flux density near the self absorption frequency ( i.e. , @xmath16 ) can be approximated , with an accuracy better than 3% , by the following simple expression : @xmath17\\right ) \\quad,\\quad \\psi \\equiv \\nu/\\nu_a,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath3 are defined in figure [ spectra ] and depend on the values of the physical parameters ( gpsb ) .    in figure [ spectra ]",
    "we show a fit between our theoretical spectra near @xmath3 and radio afterglow observations of grb970508 ( shepherd et al .",
    "1998 ) , which were made about one week after the burst . extracting the values of @xmath18 and @xmath3 from this fit and comparing them to the theoretical values results in two constraints on the parameters of the burst ( gpsb ) .    using the values of @xmath19 and the cooling break frequency @xmath20 extracted from the broad band spectra of grb970508 , and comparing them to their theoretical values , wijers & galama ( 1998 ) calculated the parameters of this burst , using a simple broken power law theoretical spectra ( @xcite ) . making a similar calculation , using the more detailed description of the self absorption break and of the spectral peak , we obtained the following values for the physical parameters of grb970508 : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the total energy of the shell and @xmath23 is the ambient number density .",
    "we have calculated the light curve and spectra due to synchrotron emission from an extreme relativistic adiabatic blast wave , which is described by the blandford - mckee ( 1976 ) self similar solution .",
    "we obtained a flat peak for the light curve , which rules out the interpretation of the sharp optical peak of grb970508 as the expected peak of the light curve .",
    "the observed image of an afterglow has been calculated over a wide range of frequencies .",
    "the image at @xmath24 is quite homogeneous , while at higher frequencies there is a bright ring at the outer edge and the center is dim .    we have calculated the physical parameters of grb970508 based on detailed calculations of the spectra near @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "the values we have obtained are different by up to two orders of magnitude from the values obtained using a simple broken power law theoretical spectra ( ) .",
    "this stresses the sensitivity of this method to the exact details of the theoretical model .",
