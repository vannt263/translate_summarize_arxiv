    "<S> the energies of different angular momentum states of a heavy - light meson were measured on a lattice in @xcite . we have now repeated this study using several different lattices , quenched and unquenched , that have different physical lattice sizes , clover coefficients and quark  gluon couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the heavy quark is taken to be infinitely heavy , whereas the light quark mass is approximately that of the strange quark . by interpolating and extrapolating in the light quark mass </S>",
    "<S> we can thus compare the lattice results with @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson experiments . </S>",
    "<S> most interesting is the lowest p - wave @xmath1 state , since it is possible that it lies below the @xmath2 threshold and hence is very narrow . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , there are no experimental results on p - wave @xmath0 or @xmath1 mesons available at present .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the energy spectrum , we measured earlier also vector ( charge ) and scalar ( matter ) radial distributions of the light quark in the s - wave states of a heavy - light meson on a lattice @xcite . </S>",
