    "there has recently been great interest in what is called fractional quantum mechanics .",
    "laskin @xcite derived a fractional schrdinger equation from a fractional version of the path integral .",
    "the nature of the fractional quantum mechanics is determined by the lvy index @xmath0 and the requirement for the first moment s existence gives the restriction @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the author first solved the fractional schrdinger equation for the infinite potential well , the bohr atom and introduced a fractional oscillator @xcite .",
    "later he derived the fractional schrdinger equation for three - dimensional motion and solved it for the bohr atom and a one - dimensional oscillator by means of semiclassical approaches @xcite .",
    "guo and xu discussed the solutions of the fractional schrdinger equation for the free particle , the infinite well , and a simple model for barrier penetration , among other _ physical applications _ @xcite and dong and xu @xcite solved some other examples in the momentum representation .",
    "zoia et al @xcite addressed the problem of the boundary conditions in fractional laplacian equations and proposed a method for the accurate calculation of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions that overcomes the difficulty that had arisen in earlier approaches when @xmath2 . in particular , they considered absorbing and free boundary conditions and took advantage of the fact that the laplacian equations exhibit exact solutions when @xmath3 is an even integer in order to test their method .    the purpose of this paper is to show that a simple collocation method is suitable for the treatment of the fractional schrdinger equation . this approach has already proved successful in standard quantum mechanics as well as for several other physical problems @xcite .",
    "we think that it is most convenient to have a method that applies to a wide variety of problems and for this reason , in this paper , we propose the ubiquitous collocation method based on little sinc functions ( lsf ) that easily accommodate to a variety of boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "in section [ sec : fqm ] we outline the main features of fractional quantum mechanics and discuss the fractional laplacian operator in terms of well known operator methods . in section [ sec : method ] we describe the collocation method , develop the fourier decomposition of the sampling functions to be used , as well as calculate explicitly the effect of the fractional differentiation operators on such sampling functions . in section [ sec : applications ] , we apply our collocation method to two fractional differentiation problems .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] we present our conclusions .",
    "by means of the fractional path integral in which the lvy motion substitutes the brownian one , laskin @xcite derived the fractional schrdinger equation @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a generalized fractional diffusion coefficient .",
    "the author proved that the fractional schrdinger operator @xmath6 is hermitian or self  adjoint@xcite .",
    "the meaning of the fractional derivative is clear from its effect upon a plane wave @xcite @xmath7 laskin @xcite also considered a 3d generalization of the fractional derivative : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the laplacian operator .",
    "on the other hand , zoia et al @xcite considered the alternative definition @xmath10 that is consistent with the one above .",
    "clearly , the effect of the fractional derivative on an arbitrary function follows from the form of the standard fourier transform @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we resort to the standard definition of the function of an operator in order to define the fractional derivative .",
    "one advantage of this definition , which is consistent with the one just outlined above , is that it enables us to obtain several results without further proof .",
    "if @xmath11 is a hermitian operator with a complete set of eigenvectors @xmath12 , @xmath13 then we define the function @xmath14 by means of the spectral decomposition @xcite @xmath15 that makes sense if @xmath16 is well defined for all @xmath17 .",
    "the extension to a continuous spectrum is straightforward .",
    "notice that if @xmath16 is real then @xmath14 is hermitian .",
    "besides , if @xmath18=0 $ ] then , obviously , @xmath19=0 $ ] .",
    "for example , on the whole line we have the standard definition in terms of the  fourier transform @xcite @xmath20 and , in terms of the fourier series for periodic boundary conditions , @xmath21 in section [ sec : method ] we consider other functions and other boundary conditions .",
    "in addition to being the basis for the numerical method proposed in this paper , the well known general operator results outlined above enable us to derive several conclusions without further proof .",
    "for example , if we choose the domain of the operator @xmath22 so that it is hermitian , then its eigenvalues are real and positive .",
    "its obvious consequence is that @xmath23 is also hermitian @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the laplacian commutes with the operator that produces the inversion transformation @xmath24 ; therefore , @xmath25 also commutes with the inversion operator @xcite .",
    "every textbook on quantum mechanics shows that the nontrivial solutions to the eigenvalue equation @xmath26 with boundary conditions @xmath27 are given by @xmath28 , \\nonumber \\\\ \\lambda & = & \\lambda _ { n}=\\frac{n^{2}\\pi ^{2}}{4a^{2}},\\;n=1,2,\\ldots \\label{eq : part_box}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , it follows from the operator equations outlined above that @xmath29 in other words , it is not necessary to solve the time  independent fractional schrdinger equation explicitly @xcite because we already know that the eigenfunctions are exactly those of the particle in an infinite well .    as a final example , consider the time ",
    "dependent schrdinger equation @xmath30 with the boundary conditions @xmath31 .",
    "straightforward application of the method of separation of variables leads to @xmath32 that generalizes the result derived earlier for the same fractional model @xcite .",
    "notice that present definition of the fractional derivative avoids the problem of nonlocality of the riesz derivative pointed out by jeng et al @xcite .",
    "as stated above , our purpose is the application of a collocation method to fractional differentiation problems on bounded intervals , with a variety of boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "this collocation method starts by sampling a function @xmath33 on @xmath34 $ ] in a finite uniform set of points @xmath35 , and then interpolating by @xmath36 where the sampling functions @xmath37 , called _ little sinc functions _ ( lsf ) .",
    "they are defined as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the partial sum kernel for a complete orthonormal set of functions @xmath40 in @xmath41)$ ] , suitable chosen according to given boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "thus , for a given operator @xmath42 , we define @xmath43 on @xmath34 $ ] by @xmath44 which then can be calculated by interpolating , in turn , the function @xmath45 .",
    "as we are interested in the application of @xmath42 when given as a function of differentiation , it is convenient to decompose each sampling function @xmath37 in exponential functions .",
    "we therefore develop the fourier decomposition for the sampling functions @xmath37 , taken from the lsf sets in @xcite , in order to apply fractional differentiation .",
    "when given periodic boundary conditions , @xmath46 , we use as an orthonormal set the functions @xmath47 with sampling points @xmath48 , @xmath49 . we will denote the corresponding set of sampling functions @xmath37 as @xmath50 .    in order to obtain the fourier decomposition for @xmath37 ,",
    "we start by calculating @xmath51 one can verify that , for any @xmath52 $ ] , @xmath53 and hence @xmath54 therefore , since @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath55 note that we can write @xmath56 we prefer the use of the last expression , as it resembles the formulas below .      in the case of given dirichlet boundary conditions , @xmath57 , we use the complete orthonormal system @xmath58 with sampling points @xmath59 , @xmath49 .",
    "the corresponding set of sampling functions will be denoted by @xmath60 .",
    "now , we have @xmath61 and note that @xmath62 .",

    "we will denote the corresponding set of sampling functions by @xmath69 .",
    "this time we have @xmath70 since we are adding only on odd numbers . as @xmath71 for every @xmath52 $ ] , we have @xmath72      in the case of given neumann boundary conditions , @xmath73 , we consider the complete orthonormal system @xmath74 @xmath75 with sampling points @xmath76 , @xmath49 . we denote the corresponding sampling function set by @xmath77 .",

    "we now note that , after taking the derivative of each @xmath86 , we obtain @xmath87 so , if @xmath88 is the momentum operator @xmath89 , we obtain @xmath90 we then define , for a given function @xmath91 , the operator @xmath92 on the functions @xmath86 by",
    "@xmath93 i.e. , we define @xmath92 through the spectrum of @xmath88 .",

    "in this section we apply the present collocation method to the fractional versions of the anharmonic oscillator and the mathieu equation .",
    "our first example is the fractional oscillator = d_(-^2 ) ^/2 + q^2 ||^ , [ fho ] studied by laskin @xcite by means of the semiclassical wkb approach . in the one - dimensional case laskin obtained the following approximate analytical expression for the energies : e_n = ( ) ^ ( n + ) ^ , [ wkb ] where @xmath122 is the beta function .",
    "this problem is suitable for illustrating the application of the collocation method described above . for concreteness",
    "we choose a dimensionless model with @xmath123 and resort to the set @xmath124 because the dirichlet boundary conditions are suitable for this problem .",
    "we obtain reasonably accurate results with @xmath125 , that corresponds to @xmath126 sampling points .",
    "the lsf are defined on an interval @xmath127 .",
    "the unphysical parameter @xmath128 may lead to inaccurate results if it is not chosen properly .",
    "if it is too small the wave function will decay too rapidly .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath128 is too large then we would need an unnecessarily large number @xmath129 of sampling points in order to have sufficiently accurate results . in order to get a reasonable balance between those parameters of the lsf method we resort to the strategy followed in earlier applications of the collocation approach based on sinc functions @xcite and then extended to lsf @xcite .",
    "since the trace of the hamiltonian matrix is invariant under unitary transformations , and the actual eigenvalues are independent of @xmath128 , then it is reasonable to choose the value of @xmath128 close to a stationary point .",
    "this principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms )  @xcite gives the optimal value of @xmath128 for a given value of @xmath129 . in the present case",
    "the stationary point is a minimum that we will call @xmath130 from now on .    in table",
    "[ table-1 ] we report the three lowest eigenvalues of the fractional harmonic oscillator ( @xmath131 ) with @xmath132 for grids of varying size . we appreciate that the value of @xmath130 shown in the second column grows with @xmath129 in agreement with the argument above .",
    "the last row shows the energies obtained by application of exactly the same approach to the schrdinger equation in the momentum representation , where no fractional derivatives are present , for a much finer grid .",
    "notice that the rate of convergence of the present collocation method depends on @xmath133 . in order to appreciate this point",
    "more clearly we may compare present results for @xmath134 , which exhibit only @xmath135 exact digits , with identical calculation for the standard harmonic oscillator ( @xmath136 ) , where just @xmath137 enables us to obtain @xmath138 that is about @xmath139 off the exact value @xmath140 .",

    "we have chosen this example simply as a test ; however , one will notice the advantage of the collocation method in the case of an arbitrary periodic potential @xmath153 where the calculation of the matrix elements may not be so simple .",
    "we have devised a numerical scheme based on collocation which allows one to solve the fractional schrdinger equation on a uniform grid .",
    "we have applied this method to obtain accurate energies and wave functions of a fractional harmonic oscillator and compared the former with the wkb ones  @xcite .",
    "our results confirm that the wkb approach yields reasonable results for excited states . in the case of the fractional harmonic oscillator",
    "the wkb formula does not give the exact result for all quantum numbers as in the ordinary case @xmath154 .",
    "we have also studied a fractional anharmonic oscillator for which the wkb formula predicts equally spaced levels like the standard harmonic oscillator .",
    "our accurate results confirm this prediction beyond any doubt .",
    "finally we have solved a fractional mathieu equation , with periodic boundary conditions , and obtained the eigenvalues for different values of @xmath133 and potential strength .",
    "one of the main advantages of the collocation methods in general is that they bypass the problem of calculating the matrix elements of the potential .",
    "this feature is most welcome when the potential  energy function is rather complicated .",
    "this is not the case of the models chosen here because we have been mainly interested in the discussion of the fractional kinetic energy ."
