    "the pyrochlore lattice is a three - dimensional network of corner - sharing tetrahedra formed by b - cations in pyrochlore oxides a@xmath4b@xmath4o@xmath8 , in cubic spinel oxides ab@xmath4o@xmath5 and in cubic laves - phase intermetallic compounds ab@xmath4 .",
    "these compounds exhibit a wide variety of physical properties ranging from magnetic insulator through bad metal to superconductor with relatively high transition temperature .",
    "one of the most spectacular properties in this family of @xmath9-systems is the heavy fermion ( hf ) behavior found in liv@xmath4o@xmath5 and y(sc)mn@xmath4 at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite to understand the nature of hf quasiparticles in y(sc)mn@xmath4 , it was suggested @xcite that effects of geometrical frustration on the itinerant electron system in the pyrochlore lattice are of crucial importance .",
    "in fact , in the pyrochlore lattice with a single orbital on each site , a special lattice geometry manifests itself through a flat band on the top of the dispersive one - particle electron spectrum.@xcite in the half - filled case , the fermi level touches the flat band singularity from below . in actual band structure calculations of a multi - orbital @xmath9-system , this singularity is removed and , instead , a sharply peaked feature in the density of states is seen . by treating the problem of y(sc)mn@xmath4 within a single band pyrochlore hubbard model in a weak correlation limit and assuming proximity of the fermi level to the peaked feature in the density of states , the authors @xcite suggested a new scenario for the hf - like behavior of the frustrated system .",
    "in contrast , in liv@xmath4o@xmath5 the mean occupancy of the @xmath6-ion @xmath9-shell equals 1.5 and corresponds to the quarter - filling of the almost three - fold degenerate @xmath10 band.@xcite therefore , in this compound the fermi level is pushed down strongly from the flat - band peculiarity and the above arguments for the hf quasiparticle formation are not applicable any more . in this respect , even by taking into account strong on - site coulomb correlation effects , not included in the band structure calculations , one can not cure the situation .",
    "several scenarios for explaining hf properties in liv@xmath4o@xmath5 , including the one based on multi - component fluctuations@xcite , are proposed in the literature and reviewed briefly in ref .. while the strong on - site coulomb interaction @xmath11 is incorporated necessarily in most of these scenarios , effects of inter - site coulomb correlations on the hf properties in the pyrochlore lattice have been studied much less .",
    "the latter effects in the form of anderson s tetrahedron rule @xcite are used explicitly in ref . to build a physical picture of low temperature properties in liv@xmath4o@xmath5 . according to this picture ,",
    "coulomb repulsions of electrons on nearest neighbor sites suppress charge fluctuations appreciably and a state of slowly fluctuating and nearly decoupled chain - like and ring configurations of spins @xmath12 is formed to give a large low temperature spin entropy .",
    "however , the mechanism for suppressing charge fluctuations in the pyrochlore lattice has not been elaborated in detail .    in the present paper , we address this problem and concentrate on the study of charge degrees of freedom and their possible role in forming heavy quasiparticles . for this purpose , the potentially important role of inter - site electron coulomb interaction in the pyrochlore lattice",
    "is emphasized in a particular case of quarter band filling appropriate to liv@xmath4o@xmath5 .",
    "we use an extended single - orbital hubbard model composed of the kinetic term with a tight - binding nearest neighbor ( n.n . ) hopping amplitude @xmath13 , strong hubbard term @xmath11 and coulomb term describing n.n .",
    "electron repulsion @xmath1 of variable strength with respect to @xmath13 . in spite of its serious simplification ,",
    "this minimal model is believed to capture generic effects of strong inter - site coulomb correlations inherent to more realistic pyrochlore electronic models including several @xmath9-orbitals on each lattice site . noting that @xmath14 is the largest energy parameter",
    ", we simply put @xmath15 in our calculations . at @xmath15 and far away from half - filling , one expects the system to be in a metallic state at weak coupling @xmath6 .",
    "our aim is to show that in the strong coupling limit , @xmath16 , an effective electron bandwidth in the quarter - filled system can be strongly reduced due to short - range charge correlations .",
    "this regime of a strongly correlated metal can be understood as a state of almost localized electrons .",
    "short - range spin correlations are neglected here because the limit @xmath15 is assumed .",
    "instead , we concentrate completely on the problem of short - range _ charge _ correlations which are believed to provide the dominant mechanism for strong suppression of the electron kinetic motion in the pyrochlore lattice and , therefore , may contribute to the heavy quasiparticle formation .",
    "to conclude this section , we outline briefly the structure of the paper and the method used .",
    "we extend the gutzwiller variational approach to a form that allows us to treat the inter - site correlation problem . for completeness , we involve in our consideration also the 2d checkerboard lattice which is a planar analogue of the 3d pyrochlore lattice .",
    "our method is applicable equally to both cases and relies on a cluster character of the pyrochlore ( checkerboard ) lattice structure , which means that each tetrahedron ( plaquette ) is regarded as an elementary entity . in section ii , the underlying electronic model is defined and rewritten in a cluster representation .",
    "the ground state variational wave function of the interacting system is constructed by applying to the system of noninteracting electrons two kinds of projectors .",
    "the first is the gutzwiller projector taken in the limit @xmath17 to eliminate double occupancy of sites .",
    "the second projector is defined in terms of cluster occupancy operators in such a way that the weights of different charge configurations in each cluster are controlled by a correlation strength parameter @xmath18 which is the only variational parameter in our theory .    in section iii ,",
    "a variational ground state energy functional is defined and a factorization procedure of its approximate calculation is discussed in detail . within this context , the concept of the basic cluster in the pyrochlore ( checkerboard ) lattice is introduced and a mechanism for suppressing of inter - cluster charge fluctuations is explained . in section iv ,",
    "the calculations are performed and the resulting ground state energy as a function of the coupling @xmath6 is analyzed .",
    "this analysis shows that the mean kinetic energy in the system is strongly renormalized and tends to zero as @xmath6 approaches some critical value @xmath7 .",
    "also , our variational theory suggests , that electron localization transition occurs at @xmath19 , and for @xmath20 the electrons are in a fully localized insulating state for which quantum charge fluctuations are completely missed .",
    "the results are discussed in section v. by drawing a close analogy with the brinkman - rice localization transition predicted in the variational study@xcite of the standard hubbard model , we argue that improper description of the actual metal - insulator transition does not invalidate our cluster variational theory in all respects . in particular , the theory is still valid in describing a metallic strongly correlated ( the not yet localized ) regime for @xmath21 .",
    "concluding remarks can be also found in section v.",
    "let us start with an extended single - orbital hubbard model in the pyrochlore or checkerboard lattice @xmath22 where the summation in the first two terms is taken over the n.n .",
    "sites , each pair @xmath23 is counted once ; @xmath24 is the creation ( annihilation ) electron operator with spin @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we are interested in the model regime far away from the band half - filling in the limit @xmath2 .",
    "let us consider a plaquette in the checkerboard or a tetrahedron in the pyrochlore lattices as an _ elementary _ @xmath27-th cluster , each contains four sites numbered as @xmath28 .",
    "each lattice site belongs to two clusters and thus the neighboring clusters overlap .",
    "if @xmath29 is the number of the lattice sites , then @xmath30 is the number of overlapping clusters , i.e. @xmath31 .",
    "now , the first two terms in the hamiltonian ( [ a1 ] ) can be rewritten in the cluster representation @xmath32 since @xmath2 , the double occupancy of sites is forbidden and the unit operator on each @xmath33-th site is @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the projection operators onto the empty and singly occupied @xmath33-th site states , respectively ; @xmath37 .",
    "further , to distinguish cluster states with occupancies @xmath38 , we define the cluster projection operators @xmath39,\\nonumber\\\\ & & { \\mathcal p}_{\\mathcal{k}}(2)= \\sum_{k < k'}{\\mathrm{p}}_{k}(1){\\mathrm{p}}_{k'}(1 ) \\left[\\prod_{k''\\neq k , k'}{\\mathrm p}_{k''}(0)\\right],\\label{a4}\\\\ & & { \\mathcal p}_{\\mathcal{k}}(3 ) = \\sum_{k=1}^{4}{\\mathrm{p}}_{k}(0 ) \\left[\\prod_{k'\\neq k}{\\mathrm p}_{k'}(1)\\right],\\nonumber\\\\ & & { \\mathcal p}_{\\mathcal{k}}(4)=\\prod_{k=1}^{4}{\\mathrm p}_{k}(1 ) ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is implied . disregarding the spins",
    ", we note that the configurational space of a cluster contains in total 16 allowed charge configurations .",
    "for instance , the occupancy state @xmath41 is composed of 6 configurations .",
    "taking into account the frustration of the system , we suggest that the basic operators ( [ a4 ] ) and the associated cluster occupancies in the lattice suffice to capture the correlated metallic regime of the model , as suggested by the form ( [ a6 ] ) of @xmath42 term below .    in terms of the projection operators ( [ a4 ] ) , the kinetic and the coulomb terms in ( [ a2 ] ) can be presented as follows @xmath43 @xmath44,\\ ] ] where the diagonal form of @xmath45 occurs because any electron hopping within a cluster does not change its charge occupancy .",
    "finally , we define the cluster number operator @xmath46 , and note that the mean value @xmath47 corresponds to the quarter band filling .",
    "a trial ground state wave function of the interacting system is constructed below in two steps .",
    "first , in the limit @xmath48 , we introduce the gutzwiller projected fermi sea @xmath49 : @xmath50|\\phi_0\\rangle \\equiv|\\psi_0\\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is a single slater determinant describing a metallic state for @xmath52 noninteracting electrons ; @xmath53 is the norm . since the system is away from half - filling , the gutzwiller projectors @xcite in ( [ a10 ] )",
    "are expected to lead to a moderate renormalization of metallic properties .",
    "a regime of strongly correlated metal at quarter band filling may occur in an interacting system with strong inter - site coulomb repulsion @xmath6 .    to take into consideration electron correlations due to @xmath54 , we define below a product of generalized gutzwiller projectors @xmath55 acting in the occupancy space of the @xmath27-th clusters ( @xmath31 ) ; here @xmath18 is the variational parameter varying in the range @xmath56 . to justify the proper choice of @xmath55 ,",
    "let us start with the limit of extreme coupling , @xmath57 . in this limit ,",
    "the ground state cluster charge configurations are those obeying the tetrahedron rule , i.e. each cluster is occupied strictly with two electrons , and the ground state energy is @xmath6 per cluster .",
    "therefore , @xmath58 and our convention is that @xmath59 in this limit . at finite @xmath13 ,",
    "electron hopping processes create exited charge configurations of higher , @xmath60 and lower , @xmath61 , cluster occupancies . to ascribe optimal weights to the exited configurations , we use the following prescription .",
    "consider first a pair of clusters , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , occupied with @xmath64 and @xmath65 electrons . by noting that the potential energy of such a fluctuation is @xmath66 , which exceeds the energy @xmath67 of the dominant configuration of two electrons per cluster by @xmath6 , we ascribe to it a weight factor @xmath68 .",
    "the cost of the potential energy of the more extreme charge fluctuation of a pair of clusters , i.e. @xmath69 and @xmath70 , is @xmath71 , and therefore we associate the weight factor @xmath72 with this fluctuation .",
    "more complex many - cluster excited charge configurations can be easily recognized to be combinations of the elementary ones discussed above .",
    "these observations are comprised in the following form of a generalized cluster gutzwiller projector @xmath73 and of a trial ground state wave function defined as @xmath74 where @xmath75 . if @xmath76 , the projector @xmath55 becomes the unity operator , which corresponds to the limit of zero coupling , @xmath48 .",
    "note , the form ( [ a43 ] ) of a generalized gutzwiller projector and , hence , the trial wave function ( [ a18 ] ) are inspired by the form ( [ a6 ] ) of @xmath42 term and anderson s reasoning @xcite on a macroscopical degeneracy of the ground state charge configurations in the limit of the extreme coupling , @xmath77 .",
    "we expect the wave function ansatz ( [ a18 ] ) to be valid down to intermediate coupling values @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the pyrochlore ( checkerboard ) lattice coordination number .",
    "it is much less appropriate in the limit of a weak coupling @xmath80 , where the kinetic energy effects become dominant and the arguments based on the potential energy counting only are not sufficient .",
    "with definitions ( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) , the ground state energy of the lattice system @xmath81 can be written as a sum of cluster energies @xmath82 where the translational invariance of the wave function ( [ a18 ] ) , i.e. @xmath83 for @xmath84 , is taken into account . from now on , the expectation energy value calculation reduces to a local problem .    to evaluate @xmath85 ,",
    "an approximate procedure is developed and applied below .",
    "the starting point is to divide the lattice into two parts .",
    "the smaller one , which is refereed below to as the _ basic cluster _ ( @xmath86 ) , contains five connected elementary clusters , as explained in fig.1 for the checkerboard lattice .",
    "according to this picture , the same hopping parameter @xmath13 and coulomb interaction constant @xmath6 should be ascribed to the horizontal , vertical and diagonal bonds ( linear segments ) connecting neighboring lattice sites .",
    "one can easily realize that the basic cluster in fig.1 has its 3d counterpart formed by five corner - sharing tetrahedra in the pyrochlore lattice , the former being a planar projection of the latter .",
    "therefore , both cases can be treated on an equal footing . with this division , we suggest that the essential effects of the local interactions involved in @xmath85 are captured by a basic cluster .    below , a factorization procedure for the trial wave function ( [ a18 ] ) is used , which reduces the calculation of expectation value @xmath85 from the lattice to a basic cluster . in the present study ,",
    "we take advantage of another simplifying assumption which amounts to the neglect of the spatial charge correlations in the _ starting _ wave function ( [ a10 ] ) .",
    "such an approximation is inherent also to the gutzwiller approach study of standard hubbard model .",
    "actually , as shown in ref .",
    ", when calculating the hopping matrix elements ( the interacting @xmath14-term is accounted for exactly ) in the @xmath87-particle state @xmath51 of noninteracting electrons , the neglect of the configuration dependence at this stage is equivalent to all assumptions made by gutzwiller @xcite and leads to an identical result.@xcite the approximation is controlled by the parameter @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the lattice coordination number ; it gives an exact result in the limit of infinite spatial dimension and requires only very small corrections for three - dimensional lattices.@xcite though the wave function ( [ a10 ] ) describes an electron system with extremely strong on - site repulsion , we expect that foregoing arguments are still valid provided the electron concentration is sufficiently far away from the half filled band case .    after explaining the very essence of the approximation chosen to calculate the expectation energy value @xmath85",
    ", we proceed now with its evaluation .",
    "first , a basic cluster is selected as a lattice fragment composed of a central elementary @xmath90-cluster whose four sites are shared with four ( i, ...",
    ",iv ) side elementary clusters , as depicted in fig.1 . from now on , the trial state ( [ a18 ] ) can be written in the following form @xmath91 where @xmath92 is referred to the central @xmath90-cluster , @xmath93 is for four side clusters and @xmath94 is for the remaining system .",
    "the factorization procedure now reads as follows @xmath95 where the trial state @xmath96 in the cluster approximation is taken in the form @xmath97 and the labelling _ bc _ is due to a distinguished basic cluster either in the pyrochlore or in the checkerboard lattice .",
    "both , three- and two - dimensional basic clusters have the same lattice connectivity and , therefore , in our study are treated equally .",
    "we believe that the basic cluster chosen is inevitably a minimal one for the present problem .",
    "this means that it could not be reduced further , for instance , to the size of 4-site elementary cluster , otherwise the most important correlation effect of the kinetic energy reduction would be lost .",
    "actually , when calculating @xmath98 , one finds that the electron hopping processes involved in @xmath99 do not change an occupancy of the @xmath100 -th cluster , but any of them changes simultaneously occupation numbers of a pair of side clusters . as a result",
    ", the side cluster charges deviate from their mean value @xmath41 . with increasing coupling constant @xmath6 ,",
    "however , the cluster states of high , @xmath60 and low , @xmath61 , occupancies are suppressed , and thus the hopping processes within the @xmath100-th cluster are hampered . as a consequence , the expectation value of the kinetic term @xmath101 is reduced strongly in a way similar to that found in the standard hubbard model treated within the gutzwiller approximation . in the latter case ,",
    "a minimal basic cluster is 2-site one as suggested by razafimandimby .",
    "@xcite    in order to facilitate evaluation of @xmath85 , we resort to a new diagonal form of the operator product @xmath102 with respect to the occupancy number @xmath103 of the central cluster @xmath100 . for this purpose ,",
    "let us consider side clusters @xmath104 and their labels @xmath27 as composite ones , @xmath105 , for instance , @xmath106 , etc . here",
    "@xmath33 denotes a site common both to the @xmath27-th and the central @xmath100 clusters , while @xmath107 refers to the complementary 3-site fragment of the @xmath108th side cluster , as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "for the @xmath109th fragment , let @xmath110 be a quantum state with an electron occupancy @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the corresponding projection operators . in terms of @xmath113 ,",
    "the projection operators @xmath114 of side @xmath27-clusters can be now written in a split form @xmath115 , with the convention @xmath116 assumed . with this redefinition of @xmath117 , the projectors @xmath118 of side clusters",
    "are also split in two terms , each selecting one of two possible occupancies , @xmath61 , of the @xmath119th site common to a given @xmath27 and the central @xmath100 clusters : @xmath120 here @xmath121 and @xmath122 operate in the charge configuration space of the @xmath109th fragment @xmath123 with the following obvious properties , @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "it is not a difficult task to rewrite the operators @xmath113 and their linear combinations ( [ a27 ] ) through the site projection operators ( [ a3 ] ) , which is useful for further calculations .",
    "the weight factors in ( [ a27 ] ) serve as a measure of the correlation strength in dependence on the @xmath109th fragment charge occupancy .",
    "finally , we use the definition ( [ a43 ] ) for @xmath92 and the presentation ( [ a26 ] ) for @xmath118 to write down the following form of the product @xmath102 : @xmath126 where weight factors @xmath127 are found to be @xmath128 , and the operators @xmath129 discriminate the basic cluster charge configurations in accord with the central cluster occupancy @xmath103 : @xmath130    the factorization procedure ( [ a22 ] ) constitutes the first step of our approximation for calculating the expectation energy value @xmath85 . as mentioned before , the second approximation consists in the neglect of electron spatial correlations within the gutzwiller projected fermi sea state @xmath131 , eq.([a10 ] ) .",
    "for instance , when having a two - site electron density correlation function @xmath132 , we decouple it as follows @xmath133 : @xmath134 where @xmath135 is an electron concentration and the extra factor 1/2 in the right - hand side is due to spatially uncorrelated electron spins . since doubly occupied sites are forbidden , @xmath136 , in terms of site projection operators ( [ a3 ] ) , the decoupling ( [ a32 ] ) reads @xmath133 : @xmath137 where @xmath138 .",
    "multi - site density correlation functions are decoupled in the same manner .    to complete this section ,",
    "let us calculate the norm @xmath139 where the average @xmath140 is over the state @xmath141 .    by using the approximation ( [ a32 ] ) and ( [ a32bis ] ) for a given electron concentration @xmath142",
    ", one finds an intermediate result @xmath143 where @xmath144 is a binomial and both @xmath145 and @xmath146 are calculated to be @xmath109independent expectation values @xmath147 .    from eq.([a33 ] ) , the norm can be now written as @xmath148 ^ 5.\\ ] ]",
    "we start with the evaluation of an expectation value of the coulomb energy .",
    "since the procedure is similar to that used in the previous section , we present the resulting expression for the mean interaction energy per cluster @xmath149      v , \\quad \\eta=0    \\end{array } \\right.\\label{a45}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] both limiting values in ( [ a45 ] ) can be easily understood on a general ground .",
    "indeed , the value @xmath150 corresponds to spatially uncorrelated electrons homogeneously distributed over the lattice , while the value @xmath6 is in compliance with any lattice charge configuration having _ two _ electrons within each elementary cluster .",
    "the evaluation of the kinetic energy is much more involved . as a starting point ,",
    "one has to rely on a general expression @xmath151 where each pair of sites @xmath152 contributes equally to the sum ( [ a46 ] ) ; from now on we also use shortened notation @xmath153 . to make the calculation more transparent ,",
    "we introduce projected fermionic operators @xmath154 related to @xmath155 as follows @xmath156 when operating in a space with no double site occupancy , @xmath154 and @xmath155 are equivalent .",
    "let us consider a particular pair @xmath157 and insert into ( [ a46 ] ) the explicit form of @xmath158 coming from ( [ a31 ] ) .",

    "it is worth discussing shortly the physical content of expressions ( [ a48 ] ) .",
    "an electron hopping within the central cluster is affected by its charge surrounding , which may occur in many configurations . in our description ,",
    "all allowed configurations of the charge surrounding are comprised by a set of operators @xmath163 and @xmath164 involved in the hopping matrix elements ( [ a48 ] ) .",
    "this becomes more clear if one uses the explicit form of @xmath163 and @xmath164 , eq.([a27 ] ) , which breaks up a hopping amplitude from ( [ a48 ] ) into a sum of terms , each of them corresponds to a particular configuration weighted with some @xmath165dependent factor . in the uncorrelated limit , @xmath76",
    ", all these factors are unity , while for @xmath166 hopping amplitudes are suppressed due to short - range charge correlations .",
    "the neglect of spatial electron correlations in @xmath167 allows us to approximate the amplitudes ( [ a48 ] ) by using a decoupling procedure .",
    "for instance , the first expression in ( [ a48 ] ) is decoupled as follows @xmath168 and the remaining two amplitudes in ( [ a48 ] ) are approximated in the same way . in ( [ a49 ] )",

    "next , by collecting these results and with the reference to ( [ a46 ] ) , we obtain the following relation between hopping amplitudes in the correlated , @xmath175 , and uncorrelated , @xmath48 , states @xmath176 the latter hopping amplitude @xmath177 is obviously related to the expectation value of the kinetic energy per cluster calculated at @xmath48 : @xmath178 this leads to the final result @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the kinetic energy renormalization factor . note that in the uncorrelated limit , @xmath48 , the necessary condition @xmath181 is fulfilled .",

    "( [ a57 ] ) suggests the critical value @xmath188 . to check this suggestion ,",
    "let us minimize @xmath85 by solving the equation @xmath189 , which relates @xmath18 to @xmath6 and requires the only solution @xmath183 at @xmath190 . in the vicinity of @xmath191 ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath192 , the kinetic energy renormalization factor is given by @xmath193 which is checked numerically to describe the mean kinetic energy reduction with high accuracy in a wide range of coupling , @xmath194 .",
    "rather generally , one may estimate the value of @xmath195 to be @xmath196 , where the coefficient @xmath197 is of order unity .",
    "therefore , according to our convention , the solution ( [ a61 ] ) applies to the strong coupling regime of the model ( [ a1 ] ) , where the wave function ansatz in the form ( [ a18 ] ) is valid .",
    "we do not intend to discuss here the variational ground state energy in the weak coupling limit , @xmath198 . as argued in sections",
    "ii , in this limit kinetic energy effects dominate inter - site coulomb correlations , the wave function ansatz in the form ( [ a18 ] ) is not applicable any more and its complementary variational extension is required .",
    "the physical picture emerging from these results is discussed in the following section .",
    "the discussion is closely related to results of the brinkman - rice theory .",
    "based on a simple trial wave function ( [ a18 ] ) with a single variational parameter @xmath18 , we infer from the results ( [ a55 ] ) , ( [ a57 ] ) and ( [ a61 ] ) that in the strong coupling regime , @xmath199 , the mean kinetic energy per cluster , @xmath200 , of the quarter - filled pyrochlore electronic system is strongly reduced by the factor @xmath201 ( @xmath202 , as @xmath203 ) .",
    "this reduction means the increasing electron localization in real space and thus a strongly correlated metallic state is expected to appear for @xmath21 . for @xmath204 ,",
    "the mean kinetic energy is zero and the variational energy is @xmath6 per cluster , which describes an insulating highly degenerate state of fully localized electrons .",
    "such a description of the insulating state is correct , however , only in the limit of extreme coupling , @xmath77 . for finite ,",
    "however , still large @xmath205 , both in the pyrochlore and checkerboard lattices@xcite charge fluctuations to leading order in @xmath206 would lower the ground state energy by the value of order @xmath207 .",
    "it means that even in an insulating state , full electron localization can not be reached .",
    "this observation casts doubt on the very existence of the predicted localization transition .    in this respect ,",
    "our results are very similar to those obtained by brinkman and rice in their study @xcite of the hubbard model based on gutzwiller s wave function and approximation in the limit of a half - filled band .",
    "there , the driving force for electron correlations and localization , at a finite strength @xmath208 , is the strong on - site hubbard interaction @xmath14 , while in the present study of the quarter band filling the electron localization is due to inter - site coulomb interaction @xmath6 .",
    "the merits and failures of brinkman - rice theory are well understood and widely discussed in the literature ( see refs . , and references therein ) .",
    "it was realized , for instance , that the simple gutzwiller wave function@xcite is not rich enough to describe the true insulating state in the hubbard model and that at any finite dimension of a lattice the occurrence of the brinkman - rice localization transition is merely due to the gutzwiller approximation used .",
    "according to this approximation , the spatial correlations in the system of noninteracting electrons are neglected .",
    "( in the present study we neglect spatial correlations in the gutzwiller projected fermi sea ( [ a10 ] ) which is the starting wave function chosen before applying a generalized gutzwiller projector ( [ a43 ] ) ) .",
    "this finding , however , does not invalidate the general conclusion about the usefulness of the gutzwiller approximation which is known to give a proper physical description in a number of situations .",
    "indeed , as shown by vollhardt , wlfle and anderson@xcite , a hubbard lattice - gas model in the not yet localized regime ( @xmath209 ) describes ground state properties of normal liquid @xmath210he ( almost localized fermi liquid @xcite ) .    in view of the above discussion",
    ", our results suggest that in the quarter - filled pyrochlore lattice a metallic state of nearly localized electrons may occur mainly due to strong enough intersite coulomb interaction , i.e. for @xmath211 . to our knowledge",
    ", the present variational theory is the first one showing the importance of short - range coulomb interaction in forming a strongly correlated metallic state in the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "calculation of physical properties of such a state is , however , beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "therefore , many questions remain to be answered .",
    "for instance , whether the predicted state is the fermi liquid and , if it is so , may one relate the renormalization parameter @xmath201 to the discontinuity at the fermi vector of the momentum distribution function ?",
    "an answer would allow us to connect the inverse of @xmath201 to a charge quasiparticle mass enhancement in the strongly correlated regime of the model .",
    "concerning a description of the weak interaction case , @xmath212 , the trial wave function ( [ a18 ] ) must be extended , for instance , by introducing a second variational parameter , which would make the present theory more attractive .",
    "we believe , however , such an extension of ( [ a18 ] ) does not change our main results , and retain these problems for a further study .",
