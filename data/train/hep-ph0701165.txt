    "<S> we study the decays @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , with an eye towards measuring the cp - violating supersymmetric parameters contained in these processes . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath0 tends to have the largest cp asymmetry and width , and is perhaps the most favourable experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> these decays are sensitive primarily to @xmath4 , the phase of the trilinear coupling @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> supersymmetry ( susy ) is widely thought to be the physics that lies beyond the standard model ( sm ) . </S>",
    "<S> susy theories typically contain many new parameters , some of which are complex , and hence violate cp . </S>",
    "<S> should susy be found experimentally , we will want to find the values of all of these parameters . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it will be important to measure the cp - violating susy phases .    </S>",
    "<S> cp - violating susy effects have been studied extensively in meson mixing @xcite , in cp violation related to the @xmath6-meson system @xcite and in electric dipole moments ( edms ) @xcite . in particular , edms provide quite stringent constraints on the low - energy cp - violating susy phases of the superparticle couplings . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if sfermion masses are taken to be of order the weak scale and complex susy parameters have phases of order unity , theoretical predictions for edms are not generically in agreement with experimental limits . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the so - called susy cp problem can be avoided in several susy scenarios @xcite as calculations of edms are highly model - dependent . in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> all susy parameters used as inputs in the numerical simulations are assumed not to violate edm constraints . </S>",
    "<S> the approach adopted here is that our observables may offer an @xmath7 measurement of relevant cp - odd susy parameters .    in a recent paper @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we showed that the decay @xmath8 is particularly sensitive to @xmath9 , the phase of the trilinear coupling @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> ( the `` stops '' @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the two mass eigenstates of the scalar superpartners of the top quark , with @xmath12 . ) in the present paper , we examine how some other decay processes depend on the susy phases . throughout </S>",
    "<S> we assume that susy has been discovered , and that the cp - conserving parameters ( e.g.  masses of susy particles ) are known independently .    </S>",
    "<S> all effects which violate cp require the interference of ( at least ) two amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> for a given decay , there are two types of cp - violating signals . </S>",
    "<S> direct cp asymmetries ( spin - independent or spin - dependent ) are proportional to @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the relative strong ( cp - even ) phase between the interfering amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> triple - product ( tp ) asymmetries take the form @xmath15 ( each @xmath16 is a spin or momentum ) , and are proportional to @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> one can therefore have a nonzero tp even if @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> it is also possible to have a nonzero tp with only a single decay amplitude if , for example , the intermediate particle has both scalar and pseudoscalar couplings  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> strong phases can be generated in one of two ways . </S>",
    "<S> first , one can have the exchange of gluons between the particles involved in the decay , leading to qcd - based strong phases . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , we do not know how to calculate the strong phases in this case . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the strong phases can be generated by the ( known ) widths of the intermediate particles in the decay . </S>",
    "<S> given that we want to _ measure _ the susy cp phases , and not simply detect the presence of cp violation , we must consider decays in which the strong phases are generated in the second way . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the decay processes can not contain too many particles which couple to gluons .    </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore quite natural to consider the decays @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath3 , where @xmath22 is a neutral higgs boson . </S>",
    "<S> there are several points here which we should note in relation to these processes . </S>",
    "<S> first , susy theories involve two higgs doublets which contain ( in the gauge basis ) two neutral scalars and one pseudoscalar . in the mass basis , these particles mix and one obtains three mass eigenstates @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> all four decays receive contributions from several diagrams , including those with an intermediate @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes are typically dominated by those diagrams in which an intermediate particle can go on shell . in susy theories , </S>",
    "<S> the lightest mass is @xmath28 gev and we therefore take the final - state @xmath22 to be @xmath23 . when it appears as an internal line in a diagram , the @xmath23 is too light to decay ( on shell ) to @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 or @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we shall retain such diagrams since they can in principle give non - negligible contributions .    </S>",
    "<S> second , triple products are due to terms of the form @xmath33 $ ] in the square of the amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> since no fermions are involved in the decay processes , no cp - violating tp s can arise here , and we have only direct cp asymmetries . </S>",
    "<S> the final - state particles do not couple to gluons and any exchange of gluons between @xmath11 and @xmath34 only serves to renormalize the couplings of the stops . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the strong phase arises only due to the widths of the intermediate particles @xmath24 and @xmath25 . for a given set of susy parameters , the widths @xmath35 and @xmath36 are calculable ( as are the ` off - diagonal widths ' associated with transitions @xmath37  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the measurement of cp violation in these decays ( due to direct cp asymmetries ) will allow us to extract and/or constrain the susy parameters , including the cp - violating susy phases .    </S>",
    "<S> third , there can be significant interference between the two decay amplitudes only if the masses of @xmath24 and @xmath25 are similar . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , it is relatively common in susy theories that @xmath38  @xcite . since it is assumed that the masses are known , we will know beforehand whether or not cp violation is likely in these decays .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we make a comment regarding our previous work , which examined cp asymmetries in @xmath39 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the process @xmath40 is interesting since it is theoretically clean ( no strong phases from gluons ) and it can have large cp asymmetries while simultaneously having a moderately large branching fraction . </S>",
    "<S> this process is particularly attractive if the intermediate higgs bosons are too light to decay to heavier final states , such as those considered in the present work ( @xmath41 , etc . ) . nevertheless , as noted in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the simple rate asymmetry for @xmath39 is extremely small . </S>",
    "<S> thus , sizeable cp asymmetries are only expected in cases where the spin of one or both of the final - state leptons is measured . </S>",
    "<S> the processes considered in the present work have an advantage over @xmath39 in that they do not require the measurement of any spins  the regular rate asymmetries can have relatively large values </S>",
    "<S> .    there are five classes of diagrams that contribute to the four processes under consideration , although not every class of diagram contributes to each process . the first class is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : feyn_diag ] . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the heavier stop decays to the lighter stop and emits a higgs boson . </S>",
    "<S> the higgs then decays to the final state @xmath42 ( where @xmath43 , etc . ) </S>",
    "<S> this process can proceed resonantly if the intermediate higgs boson(s ) can go on shell . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : feyn_diag2 ] shows the other four possibilities . in diagram ( a ) </S>",
    "<S> the stop decays to particle @xmath44 and a squark @xmath45 ( either a stop or a sbottom ) , which subsequently decays into @xmath46 and the lighter stop . diagram ( b ) is a crossed version of diagram ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> diagram ( c ) is similar to that shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : feyn_diag ] , but with the intermediate higgs replaced by a @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , diagram ( d ) shows the contribution due to a possible quadrilinear vertex .    of all the diagrams shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : feyn_diag2 ] , there is only one case in which the process can proceed resonantly . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs for the decay @xmath48 ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) , in which case the intermediate squark in diagram ( a ) is a sbottom . </S>",
    "<S> when considering @xmath2 in our numerical work we choose parameters in such a way that the sbottom(s ) can not go on - shell . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in all cases the diagrams in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : feyn_diag2 ] contribute non - resonantly . while one might be tempted to ignore these diagrams compared to the resonant higgs contributions in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : feyn_diag ] , we have found that the non - resonant diagrams can sometimes give non - negligible contributions , so we include them in our calculation . </S>",
    "<S> we will discuss this point further below .    </S>",
    "<S> we turn now to a calculation of the width and rate asymmetry for the process @xmath51 , with @xmath52 and @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> we define two invariant masses as follows : @xmath53 where @xmath54 are the four - momenta of @xmath46 and @xmath44 , respectively , and @xmath55 is the four - momentum of the @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> all dot products that arise in the calculation may be written in terms of @xmath56 , @xmath57 and the various particle masses .    </S>",
    "<S> as noted above , there are no tp s in this process . in principle </S>",
    "<S> there are polarization - dependent cp - violating observables similar to the single - spin cp asymmetry defined in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that , in the limit in which one can neglect the non - higgs - mediated diagrams , such polarization - dependent observables are sensitive to the same combinations of underlying susy parameters as are the rate asymmetries . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in this limit , one gains no new information by measuring polarizations . in principle </S>",
    "<S> the cross terms of resonant and non - resonant amplitudes can give new contributions to polarization - dependent cp - odd observables , but such contributions are expected to be suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> given the difficulty of the related measurements , and the possible suppression , we will ignore such observables and sum over the polarizations of the final - state particles .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider first the `` processes '' @xmath58 ( as opposed to the `` anti - processes , '' involving the decay of a @xmath59 , which will be considered in a moment ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( note that the indices @xmath60 associated with the @xmath61 s indicate that they have charge @xmath62 . ) </S>",
    "<S> the higgs - exchange diagrams shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> our previous paper  @xcite contains an extended discussion of the behaviour of cp asymmetries as functions of the invariant mass @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis in the present case is complicated by the non - negligible contributions of diagrams that are not in the @xmath65-channel . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , one could still define differential widths as functions of @xmath103 , and these would still be expected to exhibit resonant peaks near @xmath104 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to a numerical investigation of rate asymmetries for @xmath105 and @xmath106 . in our numerical work </S>",
    "<S> we have made extensive use of the computer program cpsuperh  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that since we are using the widths of the higgs bosons to provide the required strong phase , the rate asymmetries will only be non - negligible if there is a significant overlap of the interfering resonances ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for further discussion of this point ) . fortunately , as noted above , it is not uncommon to have @xmath107 in susy .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : stop_hh_zz_ww_hz ] shows several scatter plots of the rate asymmetries for @xmath108 and @xmath106 . in these plots we have allowed several susy parameters to vary in specified ranges , taking @xmath109  gev , @xmath110 , @xmath111  gev ( without loss of generality , the @xmath112 parameter is taken to be real and positive  see ref .  </S>",

    "<S> ] we have insisted that the mass of the lightest higgs boson be greater than or equal to 100  gev and have chosen values for the charged higgs mass and @xmath132 that are consistent with the recent bound from belle , @xmath133 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have also insisted that all supersymmetric particles have masses greater than or equal to 100  gev and that the lighter stop be kinematically allowed to decay by at least one of the following two modes : @xmath134 or @xmath135 . for the purpose of these plots we have set the widths of intermediate stops and sbottoms to be 10  gev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( varying these widths does not seem to have a significant effect on the numerical values obtained for the asymmetries , as long as the sbottoms are not allowed to go on shell . ) </S>",
    "<S> the horizontal axes in these plots show the sum of the widths for the process and the anti - process . </S>",
    "<S> if we assume a typical stop width to be approximately 10  gev , we see that it is possible to have large rate asymmetries while simultaneously having relatively large branching ratios . for example , in @xmath136 it is possible to have an asymmetry with magnitude of order @xmath137@xmath138@xmath139 when @xmath140  gev . among the decays </S>",
    "<S> considered , @xmath136 is clearly favoured in that it tends to have a larger width for a given cp asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , however , some of the other decay channels may be favoured due to increased detection efficiencies . </S>",
    "<S> note that the @xmath93 final state has fewer data points compared to the other plots because parameter sets for which a sbottom would have gone on shell have been discarded for that plot .    in figure  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : stop_hh_zz_ww_hz ] we have allowed the phase of the trilinear coupling @xmath5 to vary , but have set all other phases to zero . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the results shown in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : stop_hh_zz_ww_hz ] , we have also performed a limited analysis of the effects on the cp asymmetries due to the phases of other susy parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the strongest effects come from @xmath141 and @xmath142 , the phases of the trilinear coupling @xmath143 and gluino mass @xmath144 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the phase @xmath141 can affect the asymmetries due to the involvement of @xmath143 in the mixing of the higgs bosons . </S>",
    "<S> the phase of @xmath144 comes into play through its effect on the higgs - bottom - bottom effective vertex . </S>",
    "<S> this could lead , for instance , to a larger overlap between the two heavier higgs bosons in the available phase space , giving rise to an enhancement of the cp asymmetries . ] . </S>",
    "<S> the phase @xmath141 only seems to produce a non - negligible effect when @xmath145 is greater than 5  tev ( due to the difference in the top and bottom yukawa couplings ) . allowing @xmath142 to assume a nonzero value can lead to changes in the cp asymmetries of order @xmath146 if @xmath147 is taken to be approximately 1  tev .    to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , many physicists believe that supersymmetry ( susy ) is the physics that lies beyond the standard model , and that it will be found at a future high - energy collider . assuming that this is the case , we will want to measure the cp - violating susy parameters . with this in mind , in a previous paper @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we studied the decay @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the cp asymmetries could be large , but that they require the measurement of the spin of one or both of the final - state @xmath148 s .    in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the decays @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath3 , constructing rate asymmetries that are sensitive to cp violation in the underlying susy theory . </S>",
    "<S> there are several ways in which the current work complements that performed in our previous study . </S>",
    "<S> first , as we have shown , the cp asymmetries considered here do not require the measurement of any spins  the rate asymmetries alone are measurable and they can be relatively large . </S>",
    "<S> second , we had found in our previous work that @xmath149 is sensitive primarily to @xmath9 , the phase of the trilinear coupling @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> as noted above , the decays considered in this work are also sensitive primarily to @xmath150 , although the phases associated with the trilinear coupling @xmath143 and the gluino mass @xmath144 can also affect the asymmetries . </S>",
    "<S> third , it is worth noting that the decays considered here tend to involve a different range of higgs masses than those considered in our previous work . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the present case we need to have @xmath151 in order for @xmath2 to yield an appreciable asymmetry along with a moderately large branching fraction . in our former work , </S>",
    "<S> non - negligible asymmetries and branching fractions could be obtained for lower higgs masses .    of the processes studied in this work , we find that @xmath19 tends to have the largest cp asymmetry and width , and so it is the process which is perhaps most amenable to study . </S>",
    "<S> ( note that experimental detection efficiencies may make other decay modes more favourable . ) </S>",
    "<S> as we have emphasized , the decays of stops depend primarily on @xmath9 , and so do not provide a sensitivity to a large number of phases . </S>",
    "<S> it would be of considerable interest to investigate cp asymmetries in analogous decays of sbottoms or staus to assess their sensitivity to various susy phases ( @xmath141 , @xmath152 , and probably also @xmath150 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we are currently beginning such a study to determine if such decays might provide complementary tools for the study of cp violation in susy .    </S>",
