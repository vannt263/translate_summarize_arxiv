    "the study of field theories with massless particles has led to remarkably compact expressions for on - shell amplitudes at both tree- and loop level , most notably in planar @xmath2 super yang - mills theory at the origin of moduli space  @xcite .",
    "it is natural to ask whether results for massless on - shell amplitudes can be `` recycled '' to compute scattering processes with _ massive _ particles .",
    "massive amplitudes are of interest for several reasons .",
    "not only are massive particles ubiquitous in phenomenologically relevant theories ; masses are also used in massless theories to regulate infrared divergences , and to facilitate the computation of rational terms by encoding the @xmath3 components of loop momenta in @xmath4-dimensional unitarity cuts  @xcite .    in this paper , we argue that massless planar on - shell amplitudes at the origin of moduli space of @xmath2 sym can be used to systematically compute the tree - level s - matrix of @xmath2 sym on the coulomb branch .",
    "massive amplitudes in the spontaneously - broken theory are thus determined by on - shell amplitudes in the massless , unbroken theory .",
    "we also propose that this relation extends to the loop integrand in a certain large-@xmath5 limit .    as a simple example , consider the coulomb - branch scattering of two adjacent massive ` w - bosons ' of mass @xmath6 , with an arbitrary number of massless particles . as the coulomb - branch",
    "is parameterized by vacuum expectation values @xmath7 of scalar fields , it is natural to expect that the coulomb - branch amplitude is related to soft - scalar limits of massless color - ordered amplitudes at the origin of moduli space  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we might naively guess @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are w - bosons and massless gluons , respectively , while @xmath11 is a massless scalar of momentum @xmath12 whose r - symmetry structure is oriented in the vev direction , @xmath13 .",
    "the ` @xmath14 ' in  ( [ guess ] ) denote arbitrary additional massless states in the amplitude .",
    "we inserted scalars @xmath15 between @xmath16 and @xmath17 on the right - hand side of  ( [ guess ] ) , because this is the only allowed position considering the color - trace structure of the coulomb - branch amplitude  @xcite .",
    "as the scalar vev determines the mass of w - bosons , @xmath18 , the proposal  ( [ guess ] ) can be interpreted as a mass expansion of the coulomb - branch amplitude .",
    "however ,  ( [ guess ] ) can not be quite right as it stands ; at the very least , additional information must be supplied to make it well - defined , as the following puzzles illustrate : ( 1 )  the on - shell momenta on lines @xmath19 and @xmath20 are massive on the left - hand side , but they are massless on the right - hand side . how are these momenta related to each other ? ( 2 )  while gluon helicities are lorentz invariant , the polarizations of massive vector bosons depend on the frame .",
    "how does this frame - dependence show up on the right - hand side ? ( 3 )",
    "the soft limit @xmath21 on the right - hand side depends on the momentum directions @xmath22 of the vev scalars ; how does this @xmath22-dependence reflect itself in the coulomb - branch amplitude ? ( 4 )  finally , there is another , even more worrisome obstacle : the soft - scalar amplitudes on the right - hand side generically suffer from soft divergences in the limit @xmath21 , which get worse as we increase the number of soft scalars @xmath23 . how can these divergences be avoided or treated ?    in  @xcite , the first three puzzles above were addressed and resolved as follows .",
    "one first introduces an arbitrary light - like reference vector @xmath24 .",
    "motivated by the ` massive spinor - helicity formalism '  @xcite , we decompose the momenta on the massive lines of the coulomb - branch amplitude as @xmath25 in this decomposition , @xmath26 is a light - like momentum that differs from the massive momentum @xmath27 only by an @xmath28 term .",
    "it is thus natural to pick @xmath29 as the massless momentum of the gluon @xmath30 on the right - hand side of  ( [ guess ] ) .",
    "we also use @xmath24 as the reference vector for the @xmath31-boson polarizations .",
    "the frame - dependence of the coulomb - branch amplitude then reflects itself in an explicit @xmath24-dependence on the left - hand side of  ( [ guess ] ) .",
    "we have thus specified how momenta and polarizations of massive and massless particles on both sides of  ( [ guess ] ) relate to each other ; for a more detailed dictionary , including the explicit polarization vectors , the interested reader can peek ahead at table  [ tabstates ] below .",
    "the left - hand side of  ( [ guess ] ) now depends on the choice of one light - like vector @xmath24 . for  ( [ guess ] ) to pass the basic consistency check of relating objects with the same parameters ,",
    "we are forced to pick all vev - scalar momenta on the right - hand side to be identical , @xmath32 .",
    "but this introduces a new problem : the right - hand side suffers from collinear divergences in this limit ! in  @xcite ,",
    "a remedy to this problem was proposed : since collinear divergences are anti - symmetric in collinear momenta , we need to symmetrize the right - hand side of  ( [ guess ] ) in all vev - scalar momenta @xmath22 before taking the limit @xmath32 .    in summary",
    ", this suggests a refined version of the proposal  ( [ guess ] ) : @xmath33 here , the subscript ` sym ' denotes a symmetrization of the scalars in their momentum directions @xmath22 before taking the collinear limit @xmath32 . in the coulomb - branch amplitude , the massive states have momenta @xmath27 and @xmath24-dependent polarizations ; they are mapped to massless particles with momenta @xmath29 .",
    "it was argued in  @xcite that  ( [ generalization ] ) can be used to compute the coulomb - branch amplitude _ to leading order in the mass_. beyond the leading non - vanishing term in the sum over @xmath23 , however , ( [ generalization ] ) generically suffers from soft divergences in the limit @xmath34 .",
    "we will argue in this paper that _ all soft divergences cancel for a judicious choice of the scalar momentum direction @xmath24 .",
    "_ for this choice of @xmath24 ,  ( [ generalization ] ) is valid to all orders , as we verify in several examples .",
    "we then generalize  ( [ generalization ] ) to amplitudes with arbitrarily many massive lines of arbitrary mass , and to the coulomb - branch loop integrand in a certain large-@xmath5 limit .",
    "one can actually deduce the special choice of @xmath24 for which  ( [ generalization ] ) holds from another point of view , without ever considering soft divergences .",
    "in fact , there is something puzzling about the proposal  ( [ generalization ] ) as we have stated it so far : the momenta @xmath29 of the particles in the massless amplitude on the right - hand side do not sum to zero !",
    "in fact , it follows directly from  ( [ decomp ] ) that momentum conservation is violated on the right - hand side by a term of @xmath28 .",
    "clearly , this violation is subleading in the mass expansion , and was thus irrelevant for the leading - order analysis of  @xcite . to get the correct coulomb - branch amplitude to all orders from  ( [ generalization ] ) , however , we can not neglect this subtlety : the subleading terms are ambiguous , and  ( [ generalization ] ) is thus generically ill - defined .",
    "there is a surprisingly simple cure for this problem : we simply demand that @xmath24 is chosen in such a way that the massless projections @xmath29 of the momenta in the coulomb - branch amplitude sum to zero . was used in  @xcite to simplify expressions for coulomb - branch superamplitudes . ]",
    "explicitly , we demand that @xmath24 satisfies @xmath35 for coulomb - branch amplitudes with two adjacent massive lines , which satisfy @xmath36 due to the coulomb - branch constraint @xmath37 , this special choice of @xmath24 is equivalent to the simple orthogonality condition @xmath38 ( while keeping @xmath39 ) .",
    "the condition becomes more complicated as we increase the number of massive lines , but a solution always is  ( [ spq ] ) problematic because , for example , @xmath40 implies @xmath41 so that @xmath24 is a singular choice of reference vector for line @xmath42 .",
    "] exists . in practice , we will not need to solve for a @xmath24 that satisfies  ( [ spq ] ) ; instead ,  ( [ spq ] ) simply provides an additional relation that can be used to manipulate amplitudes .",
    "remarkably , with the choice  ( [ spq ] ) for @xmath24 , _ all soft divergences cancel _ in the symmetrized soft - scalar amplitudes @xmath43 , for any number of vev scalars ! the proof of the cancellation of soft divergences in  ( [ generalization ] ) , and in the corresponding generalization to arbitrary coulomb - branch amplitudes , is one of the main results of this paper .",
    "this makes the proposal well - defined to all orders , and allows us to verify it in examples .",
    "as we stated above , the symmetrization in  ( [ generalization ] ) is intended to cancel the collinear divergences in the soft - scalar amplitudes .",
    "indeed , we will show explicitly below that all collinear divergences cancel after symmetrization in the momenta @xmath12 of the vev scalars .",
    "this symmetrization is actually quite natural , independent of its purpose to eliminate collinear divergences : as the color generators of scalars in the vev direction commute with each other , vev scalars should not be ordered with respect to one another .",
    "this `` unorderedness '' is accomplished by the sum over permutations in the color - ordered amplitude .",
    "however , one may fear that the summation over @xmath44 terms in the symmetrization of an amplitude with @xmath23 vev scalars is so cumbersome that it makes the proposal  ( [ generalization ] ) impractical to implement .",
    "as we will see , the exact opposite is the case : the _ sum over symmetrizations simplifies the amplitude _ for a convenient choice of representation . indeed ,",
    "choosing the mhv vertex expansion  @xcite with reference spinor @xmath45 $ ] , we will show that the symmetrization eliminates many diagrams from the expansion , and simplifies others .    to obtain the full coulomb - branch amplitude from the proposal  ( [ generalization ] ) ,",
    "the subleading terms on the right - hand side in  ( [ generalization ] ) in particular must reproduce the subleading terms in internal propagators @xmath46 . in field theory , it is well - known that the ` @xmath47 ' in a propagator can be built up as a sum over diagrams in which we treat the mass term in the lagrangian as an interaction vertex . in our case , however , there is a key difference : @xmath48 itself also contains an @xmath28 piece because @xmath49 .",
    "this is more than a technicality ; as we are only allowing ourselves to use _ on - shell _ amplitudes of the massless theory in the construction of the coulomb - branch s - matrix , both external and internal momenta differ between the massless and the massive scattering process .",
    "if the proposal  ( [ generalization ] ) is correct beyond the leading order , it must account both for ` @xmath47 ' _ and _ the shift of @xmath48 itself in the propagator .",
    "as we will see , the ` @xmath47 ' is indeed produced by attaching scalars directly to the internal propagator , while the @xmath28 piece in @xmath50 is reproduced in a much more interesting way : it comes from the finite term that remains after summing all soft - divergent diagrams in which soft scalars attach to the external lines !    in this paper , we use the mhv vertex expansion as a technical tool to analyze the soft - scalar amplitudes on the right - hand side of  ( [ generalization ] ) .",
    "it allows us to ` resum ' the infinite sum over soft - scalar amplitudes into expressions with a finite number of diagrams .",
    "the ` feynman rules ' for these diagrams are easily deduced , leading to a new csw - like expansion for coulomb - branch amplitudes .",
    "csw expansions for amplitudes in spontaneously - broken gauge theories were considered previously : in  @xcite , a csw expansion for the electro - weak theory was derived from a lagrangian  @xcite approach ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "it is quite curious that our construction of a csw - like expansion here neither relies on lagrangians nor on complex shifts , but instead follows directly from  ( [ generalization ] ) . despite the focus on csw expansions in this work",
    ", we emphasize that  ( [ generalization ] ) can be applied to any choice of representation for the soft - scalar amplitudes .",
    "other choices may lead to new interesting expressions for coulomb - branch amplitudes that make , for example , dual conformal symmetry manifest .    in section  [ sec2mass ] ,",
    "we verify the proposal  ( [ generalization ] ) in examples of coulomb - branch amplitudes with two massive lines . in section  [ csw2 ]",
    ", we derive the diagrammatic rules of the csw - like expansion for two - mass amplitudes , and use it reproduce various known coulomb - branch amplitudes . in section  [ secgeneral ] ,",
    "we present our proposal for coulomb - branch amplitudes with arbitrary masses , and prove that all soft divergences cancel in general .",
