    "the presence of liquid water on the surface of a terrestrial planet is a basic requirement for habitability in planetary systems .",
    "the questions one needs to answer in this connection are    * when the terrestrial planets formed how much was their content of water ? * why do nt we find water in the same quantities on the other terrestrial planets ? *",
    "what happended to the water when a mars - sized object hit the earth and the moon formed ? * what happened during the late heavy bombardement ( lhb ) * where from came water after the lhb ?",
    "* what is the role of the comets from the oort cloud ?",
    "a main problem in this context is to find out where the water came from in the early stages on the one hand ; on the other hand , when water was lost during special phases in later stages one needs to explain how it was replenished on the surface . at the end",
    "one should explain also how it could stay liquid on a terrestrial planet in the habitable zone for times up to billions of years .",
    "a central question in this respect is the collisional behaviour of small bodies regarding their content of water ; it has to be modelled with specially designed effective programs like the well known sph ( smooth particle hydrodynamics ) codes .",
    "the possible water loss of terrestrial like planets in our solar system ( ss ) and in extrasolar planetary system ( eps ) in general should be set in context with geophysical processes like the stop of outgassing due to rapid mantle and core cooling or lack of atmospheric protection by a planetary magnetosphere    * the stellar radiative environment of young active stars ( ss and eps ) * collisions of protoplanetary objects in general ( ss and eps ) , * the late heavy bombardement ( ss ) * the formation of the moon ( ss )    after the early stage the transport mechanisms in our ss from the main belt and also the edgeworth - kuiper - belt can adequately be computed taking into account the important role of all sorts of resonances : mean motion resonances , secular resonances and three body resonances .",
    "the water delivery of the comets from the oort cloud can be investigated statistically although it can only account for a fraction of the water on earth regarding their different d / h ratio .",
    "comets may have been brought into the inner ss by orbital changes due to passing stars , interstellar clouds and galactic tides leading to comet showers .",
    "although the water transport is the central question it is of fundamental interest to investigate how organic ( carbon - containing ) material could be delivered which then lead or may have lead to the development of life on earth - like planets in habitable zones .",
    "different scenaria will have formed very different architectures of the planets in an extra solar planetary system compared to our own system .",
    "the observed , close - in , jupiter like planets , which evolved into such orbits via migration processes , make it difficult to explain the continuous existence of terrestrial planets on stable orbits within the habitable zone .",
    "together with theoretical investigations on habitable planets , results from the existing satellite missions ( corot , kepler and herschel ) as well as future ones ( plato , james webb , gaia ) combined with the progress in earth - bound observations ( alma , eso ) will help to clarify the origin and presence of water ( and organic materials ) as a basis for life .",
    "from many articles concerning the formation of terrestrial planets and their content of water ( e.g. @xcite ) we can draw a coherent picture of those phases of planet - formation where the debris disk and a giant planet were already present .",
    "following current models , most of a planet s water - content can be regarded as being produced by collisions between the growing protoplanet and moon to mars - sized planetesimals originating from the asteroid belt . according to @xcite and",
    "also @xcite the accretion of planetary embryos from distant regions ( outside the snowline ) by terrestrial planets could have happened also without the presence of a jupiter - sized object .",
    "other studies claim that the early earth as well as the terrestrial planets were dry , just as the asteroids in the region of their formation , because only in the cold outer part of the early ss gas and water were present in big quantities ( @xcite ) .",
    "but in these phases collision events ( @xcite ) as well as the euv radiation from the early star could have reduced the water content in these regions ( e.g. @xcite ) . at any rate during a later stage water was brought onto the surfaces of the terrestrial planets and , whereas venus and mars could not keep their water on the surface , the earth s magnetosphere inticipated water loss ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "many scenarios try to explain the water transport onto earth ; the most plausible seems to be that the c - asteroids from the outer main belt of asteroids , main belt comets ( @xcite ) and small bodies from outer regions of the ss up to the scattered disk , consisting in big parts of frozen water contributed to the water content on earth .",
    "given the discovery of water and a subsurface ice reservoir on the asteroid 24 themis ( @xcite ) , and comet - like activity of several small asteroids it is clear that water is in fact abundant in many solar system bodies and may even lie well hidden inside a crust .",
    "collision probabilities , impact velocities and size distributions depend crucially on the orbits of the colliding objects as well as the perturbations of the planets on their motion respectively . regarding these topics , namely    *",
    "formation and early development of earth - like planets with respect to their water content , * the possible loss of water through collisions with other celestial bodies ( e.g. the impact of a mars - like body onto the earth with subsequent formation of the moon , ( @xcite , @xcite ) and * late water transport ,    can not be modelled by pure gravitational n - body simulations , but with sophisticated codes including accretion , the role of the disks , the collisional growth etc.(@xcite ) .",
    "numerous simulations concerning the formation of planets in the early solar system have been performed where the early formation of a gas giant ( jupiter ) is assumed .",
    "hereby the giant planets are playing a key role ; they formed when still there was a considerable amount of helium and hydrogen present in the early solar nebula .",
    "later accretion of terrestrial planets is closely connected to the perturbations due to these planets on planetesimals within the inner part of the disk ( @xcite , @xcite",
    ". the process of accretion of embryos by terrestrial planets may be possible for different giant planet configurations , and even without gas giants present in the system ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "although most of the discovered eps host at least one big planet ",
    "due to a biased sample because of the constraints in our observations  this may not be the rule for the formation of planetary systems in general ( e.g. corot-7b , c ) .",
    "a crucial factor for water - delivery scenarios onto terrestrial planets is the so - called snowline which is due to the outward diffusion of gas charged with vapour that condensates on existing particles during the period when its temperature changes .",
    "this change acts on the accumulation of particles that originate from further radial distances and have a faster inward migration because of to their small sizes . as a consequence",
    ", water can be present as water ice bound in icy planetary embryos in the outer parts ( respectively beyond the snowline ) of the protoplanetary disc .",
    "accretion of water from these bodies is a stochastic process , therefore planets may have different water content due to their different histories ( @xcite ) . in this article it is also claimed that such contributions to water on terrestrial planets may be minor because of the perturbations of jupiter .",
    "there exist quantitative estimates for the impact erosion of atmospheres and condensed oceans of planets during the lhb ( @xcite ) . but",
    "also the delivery of prebiotic organic matter ( c , h , o , n and p ) together with water by main belt comets and also comets from the oort cloud(@xcite ) has been established via hydrodynamic simulations . according to recent results of computations by",
    "@xcite some small amount of amino acids could even survive low impact velocities as subsurface habitats .",
    "one expects that the main source for water delivery to the earth are asteroids in the main belt between mars and jupiter ( as well as comets from the oort cloud ) .",
    "a water gradient in the protoplanetary disk such that at 1 au bodies were dry , whereas bodies at 2.5 au contain 5 percent of water is the usual assumption .",
    "it is well known ( @xcite ) that asteroid groups in the main belt with high inclination to the ecliptic plane can evolve to become mars crossers .",
    "such configurations seem promising candidates , if one was to look for possible mechanisms that can uphold a constant supply of material into the inner solar system .    in our preliminary approach we took a sample of fictitious small bodies in the region where now the hungaria family of asteroids is located .",
    "this family is believed to originate form a violent dynamical event ( @xcite , @xcite ) about 0.5 gyrs ago that caused an injection of the hungaria predecessors into orbits with an inclination of about 20 degrees .",
    "another interesting point is the proximity of these asteroids to the 4:1 mean motion resonance with jupiter as well as several secular resonances as their semimajor axes are mostly between 1.8 and 2 au ) . nowadays",
    "the hungaria group consists of more than 8000 known members with the largest objects with sizes up to 12 km .",
    "the membership of asteroids within this group to one or more families is still in debate ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , for our purposes , the existence of such bodies will be taken as a reasonable argument , that during dynamically more violent times in the lates stages of the solar system s formation , planetesimals could have been proliferated to this region of the main belt .",
    "we have undertaken numerical simulations up to 40 million years , in order to investigate the number of possible close encounters respectively impacts of our test population with the terrestrial planets in the inner solar system . as a dynamical model we chose to include the venus - earth - mars - jupiter - saturn system as it is now , with exception that we did not consider the moon explicitly .    using results by @xcite",
    "300 planetesimals were distributed in a phase space region of the hungaria group which has been shown to lead to an increased number of close encounters .",
    "another 648 were placed in the groups enclosing resonances .",
    "the goal was to see how quickly the respective populations become so - called near - earth - asteroids , where every now and then one might have close encounters respectively impacts on the earth ( and also mars and venus ) .",
    "the four different chosen regions , where the initial conditions for the four different samples were chosen , are given below :    * * s1 * : 300 hungarias clones with three different semimajor axes a = 1.90792307 , 1.91027822 , 1.90508465 au and equally distributed eccentricities in the range @xmath0 and inclinations in the range of @xmath1 .",
    "* * s2 * : 216 clones close to the @xmath2 secular resonance equally distributed with slightly larger semimajor axes than the hungarias @xmath3 au and the eccentricities and inclinations like in * s1*. * * s 3 * : 216 clones close to the @xmath4 secular resonance equally distributed with slightly smaller semimajor axes than the hungarias @xmath5 au and the eccentricities and inclinations like in * s1*. * * s4 * : 216 clones in the region of the @xmath4 secular resonance with semimajor axes @xmath6 au , the eccentricities like in the range of * s1 * but with significantly larger inclinations @xmath7 .    in fig.[sec - res",
    "] we depict the region of hungaria family in an plot @xmath8 versus the semimajor axes . note that the bodies in samples * s1 * , * s2 * and * s3 * have the same inclinations but their initial conditions are shifted to larger respecively smaller semimajor axes .",
    "the initial orbital elements for the fictitious bodies of * s4 * are distributed in semimajor axes @xmath6 and have large initial inclinations ( around @xmath9 ) . of the figure ) .",
    "[ sec - res ]       the results for the four different planetesimal samples are summarized in the following graphs 2 - 5 .",
    "we note that during our integrations the mutual perturbations between planetesimals was neglected and only close encounters with the planets were reported .",
    "[ f1 ]     depending on the close encounters we could extrapolate collision timescales which are crucial for estimates for a possible water transport onto the terrestrial planets ; we estimated the water content to be three percent of the small bodies masses .",
    "[ f3 ]     fig.[f1 ] shows the number of close encounters within the so - called hill s sphere where @xmath10 is the mass of the planet in solar masses .",
    "it can be regarded as a sphere of influence where inside the gravitation of the planet is larger than the one of the sun ] .",
    "we note that for venus the results do not agree with other studies with respect to the frequency of close encounters ( e.g.@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this is because of the relatively short integration time in our investigations .",
    "the transport of the asteroids from the hungaria region to the inner regions of the planetary system takes longer ( about several tenth of million years ) than for mars and the earth . in fig.[f3 ] we compare the closest encounters during the integrations for the four samples for all planets .",
    "one can see that counted in planetary radii only one real collision occured and that is one with jupiter . although no collisions are reported for the terrestrial planets we can extrapolate these results of the frequency of the close encounters and find ( see next chapter ) an estimation of the time interval of a single hungaria clone for an encounter .",
    "it is also visible from the graph that the ( biased , see former remark about the integration time ) tendency for collisions is getting larger from venus to jupiter ; this reflects the results shown in fig.[f1 ] where one can see the increasing number of close encounters from venus to jupiter .",
    "the larger values for the closest distances to saturn in planetary radii reflects also the smaller number of encounters to this planet .",
    ".impact times for the samples * s1 * -*s4 * ( columns 3 - 6 ) onto the terrestrial planets within 1 gyr [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab - prob ]    we need to say that in all our samples real collisions were very rare !",
    "we used the results of the many encounters to the planets to derive from there a value for possible impacts ( see figs .",
    "binned values of the encounters were plotted versus the number of such events .",
    "a logarithmic least square fit provided us with the desired value for the probability of collisions .",
    "we do not show this fit for venus because the results are biased because of the small number of events .",
    "it is evident that mars  as closest to the hungarias",
    " suffers from impacts first of all , whereas venus globally is the planet with the least such events ( due to the relatively short time scales of integrations ) .",
    "most impacts of the fictitious objects occured in * s1 * , which is a somewhat surprising fact , because shifting versus the secular resonances ( * s2 * and * s3 * ) should cause more perturbations on a body located there .",
    "totally insignificant for the transport of small bodies to the inner system seems to be the group * s4 * , which is probably due to the large inclinations we have chosen for the initial conditions .",
    "[ f6 ]     in fig.[f6 ] we plotted the mean values of the impact time scales which are the intersecting lines between the patterned and full bar segments .",
    "the mean values plus one standard deviation are denoted by the top of the bars , mean values minus one standard deviation by the bottom end of the patterned region .",
    "the large errors ( especially for venus and for all planets in * s4 * are caused by the poor statistics due to the choice of the integration time respectively the initial conditions .",
    "in addition to the former results we have undertaken numerical experiments with a fictitious planetary system consisting of more massive terrestrial bodies comparable to a recent study by @xcite . in our new study of the sample * s1 * , also for 300 clones representing small bodies , we have taken five times large masses for the terrestrial planets ] for these planets ; we expected many more impacts because of the higher gravitational perturbations .",
    "in fact in contrary to the former results for the real ss where only 1 real collision ( namely with jupiter ) was reported in this investigation the results are the following ones :    * 5 with venus at 8.9 , 8.58 , 19.1 , 34.7 and 38.6 myrs * 3 with earth at 33.9 , 43.13 and 46 myr * 2 with mars 18.1 37.8 myr * 1 with jupiter at 37.7 myr    these results agree much better with the ones we mentioned above , namely that venus is suffering the most of collisions .",
    "we can explain this ",
    "expected result  that the time scales of transport of the planetesimals to the inner ss are much faster in the case with @xmath11 .",
    "[ f4 ]     [ f5 ]",
    "the values from the former tab.1 can now be used to estimate not only the how many bodies from this region may hit the earth , it can also be used to estimate  in principle  how much water was transported from this region in the ss to our planet . because of the very small number of impacts ( see tab.1 ) the contribution to the water in the crust of the earth ( estimated to be several @xmath12 ) is for sure insignificant !",
    "another result is of interest in this context : by far mars suffers from most of such impacts and thus received a lot of more water even than earth .",
    "but where is the water now ?",
    "new results show that man structures on the surface of mars are due to floating water . during the development of the solar system this planet lost most of its water because the thin atmosphere , the much lower gravitation field and the absence of a protecting magnetosphere ( @xcite )    for the water on earth we can summarize that the phase space region around the hungaria asteroid group is capable of injecting planetesimals into the inner solar system but the total number is in fact far to low .",
    "the timescales necessary for a considerable number of impacts are too large to constitute an efficient water transport mechanism and to contribute to our actual water on our planet and thus this region can be excluded as source for water delivery to the earth .",
    "this preliminary study can be understood as a first step of investigation of the whole phase space between mars and jupiter with respect to the transport to terrestrial planet crossing regions ( region of near earth asterroids ) and thus to possible collisions of small bodies with different water content on these planets , especially on the earth .",
