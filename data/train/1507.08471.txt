    "since the discovery of the higgs - like particle by the atlas and cms collaborations at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) in 2012@xcite , the main task of the lhc program has shifted to the searches for new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "these searches cover a wide range of possible signatures , notably various combinations of jets ( with or without b - tagging ) , the missing transverse energy ( @xmath10 ) and/or leptons . in this direction ,",
    "the atlas collaboration has recently reported an intriguing excess at @xmath0 significance in the leptonic-@xmath11 channel@xcite .",
    "based on the full dataset in 2012 , which corresponds to about @xmath12 integrated luminosity at the 8 tev lhc , the collaboration observed 29 events for the on - z electron and muon pair channels in contrast with the expected sm background number @xmath13 , and no excess over the sm background was observed in any other signal region ( sr)@xcite .",
    "so far there have been several attempts to explain the excess by the production of new physics particles , which are needed to decay with a sizeable rate into jets as well as at least one z boson and one invisible particle @xcite . in the context of supersymmetric theories ( susy ) , in order to provide enough events after the rather tight cuts employed in @xcite , the production of a pair of moderately light gluinos was usually utilized for the explanation@xcite . the key point in doing",
    "this is to choose a lightest susy particle ( lsp ) with relatively suppressed couplings to squarks , so that the gluino prefers to decay first into the neutralino other than the lsp , and the neutralino subsequently decays into the lsp plus a z boson . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    ", a higgsino - dominated neutralino has very weak couplings to light flavor squarks , so one can naturally imagine a higgsino - dominated lsp and assume the decay chain @xmath14 ( @xmath15 represents a light flavor quark , and @xmath16 denotes a gaugino - dominated neutralino ) to interpret the excess .",
    "for this case , we note that the measured dark matter relic density is not easy to obtain if only the neutralino serves as the dark matter candidate ( see for example , fig.1 in @xcite ) . in the next - to minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm)@xcite",
    ", however , a singlino - dominated neutralino also has the property , and meanwhile if it acts as the lsp , the correct relic density can be achieved by multiple annihilation channels@xcite .",
    "so in this work we are interested in the interpretation of the @xmath7-excess in the nmssm with a singlino - dominated lsp .    in the framework of the nmssm with a singlino - dominated lsp , the gluino pair production with the three - body decay",
    "@xmath17 has been studied for the @xmath7-excess in @xcite .",
    "these works indicated that only with simple assumptions on the relevant model parameters can the nmssm explain the excess quite well . explicitly speaking ,",
    "it was found that after considering the constraints from the atlas searches for @xmath5 signal , the nmssm can reproduce the central value of the excess , and even if one further considers the constraint from the cms search for the leptonic-@xmath11 channel which observed no excess in all srs , the event number of the atlas on-@xmath7 signal can still reach 11 , which is about @xmath18 away from the measured central value@xcite . moreover ,",
    "as illustrated in @xcite the gluino explanation can reproduce well various distributions of the excess presented by the atlas collaboration .",
    "albeit these advantages , we still think that it is necessary to seek for other explanations since in the gluino explanation , the gluino mass is limited in a narrow range , and at same time the relevant sparticle mass spectrum must be rather compressed to escape the constraints ( see fig.2 of @xcite ) . in this work",
    ", we consider squark pair production as an explanation of the excess , and in order to compare it with the gluino explanation , we make similar assumptions on the model parameters to those of @xcite .",
    "we find that in the squark explanation the range of the squark mass can be significantly extended in comparison with the gluino explanation , and moreover the relevant sparticle mass spectrum may become less compressed .",
    "we also find that , just like the gluino explanation , the distributions of the excess can also be reproduced well in the squark explanation .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ] , we briefly introduce our scenario for the excess . in section",
    "[ sec : results ] , we perform a comprehensive analysis of the relevant parameter space and present the results of our simulations on the z - peaked excess . in section [ sec :",
    "compare ] , we choose some representative parameter points , and exhibit their predictions on various distributions of the excess in comparison with the corresponding data provided by the atlas collaboration . in section [ sec : test ] , we briefly discuss future test of our scenario at the 14 tev lhc . at last ,",
    "we draw our conclusions in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "as one of the most economical extensions of the mssm , the nmssm contains one gauge singlet higgs superfield @xmath19 in its matter content .",
    "the superpotential of the general nmssm is given by@xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the superpotential of the mssm without the @xmath22 term , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the @xmath25 doublet superfields , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are dimensionless coefficients , @xmath28 parameterizes the tadpole term and @xmath29 is a supersymmetric mass .    in this framework",
    ", the fermionic component field of @xmath19 which is usually called singlino @xmath30 will mix with the gauginos and the higgsinos of the mssm to form neutralinos . in the basis @xmath31",
    ", the corresponding mass matrix is given by @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are soft gaugino masses , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are vacuum expectation values ( vev ) of the higgs fields @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively , @xmath39 with @xmath40 denoting the vev of the singlet scalar field @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "this matrix can be diagonalized by a @xmath43 unitary matrix @xmath44 , and consequently neutralinos as mass eigenstates are defined by @xmath45 where the mass order @xmath46 is assumed .",
    "obviously , the matrix element @xmath47 measures the size of the @xmath48 component in @xmath16 state , and for the singlino - dominated and bino - dominated neutralinos , their masses are mainly determined by the combination @xmath49 and @xmath33 respectively . moreover , with the help of @xmath47 one can get the interactions of the neutralinos . as shown in @xcite , the @xmath50 coupling with @xmath15 denoting a light flavor quark",
    "is determined by the gaugino components of @xmath16 , and the @xmath51 coupling is determined by the higgsino components of the neutralinos . by contrast , the @xmath52 coupling with @xmath53 denoting the sm - like higgs boson depends on all components of the neutralinos , and there may exist cancelations among different contributions .",
    "these characters are helpful to understand our explanation of the @xmath7-excess .        in the following ,",
    "we intend to interpret the atlas on - z excess by squark pair production . to make our explanation as simple as possible",
    ", we have the following assumptions :    * only the first and second generation squarks are responsible for the excess . in our analysis , we assume a common mass @xmath9 for the squarks , then the cross section for the squark pair production depends only on @xmath9 and @xmath54 .",
    "we calculate the cross section at the nlo with the code prospino @xcite , and show its dependence on @xmath9 at the 8 tev lhc in fig.[crosssection ] . *",
    "the leptonic-@xmath55 signal is generated by the cascade decay @xmath56 . in order to maximize this signal rate , we require both @xmath57 and @xmath58 at roughly @xmath59 , where the former requirement can be satisfied if @xmath3 and @xmath4 are singlino - dominated and bino - dominated respectively , and only the two particles in the neutralino and chargino sector are lighter than the squarks , and the latter condition can be realized if @xmath60 or if the @xmath52 interaction is significantly suppressed ( see above discussion and also our previous work @xcite ) . * with the above assumptions , the parameters involved in our explanation are @xmath9 , @xmath54 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 . in our discussion , we vary these parameters freely , but noting that the process @xmath63 can also generate multi - jets @xmath64 signal , we limit these parameters by the atlas searches for the multi - jets signal , which were presented in @xcite .",
    "we also consider the cms search for the leptonic-@xmath55 signal @xcite as an alternative constraint on the parameters",
    ".    about our scenario for the @xmath7-excess , we have following additional remarks :    * we ad hoc require that only @xmath3 and @xmath4 among the neutralinos are lighter than the squarks .",
    "this will simplify our analysis , but on the other hand , since the rate and various kinematic distributions of the process @xmath65 are decided by few parameters , the capability of our scenario to interpret the excess is limited given that the scenario must satisfy the constraints mentioned above .",
    "in fact , as implied by the results of @xcite , allowing the squarks to decay in multiple ways facilitates susy to balance the atlas signal and the constraints , and is thus able to explain the excess in a better way .",
    "this , however , needs an intensive scan over a higher dimensional susy parameter space , and for each parameter point , simulations on various susy signals have to be done to compare with the corresponding experimental data .",
    "such calculations are very time - consuming , and are beyond the capability of our cluster .",
    "* again for the sake of simplicity , we do not consider the effect of the third generation squarks in our analysis .",
    "these squarks have been tightly limited by the sm - like higgs boson mass , and are preferred to be heavy@xcite .",
    "for some optimized points in fig.[fig2 ] for the @xmath7-excess , we once included their contributions to the leptonic-@xmath55 and the multi - jets @xmath64 signals by assuming the degeneracy of all squarks .",
    "however , we did not find any improvement on our explanation due to the constraints we considered . *",
    "the assumptions on the properties of the lsp and nlsp in this work are same as those of our previous work @xcite , where gluino pair production was used for the excess .",
    "this enables us to compare directly the two explanations .",

    "point p1 and p3 correspond to the best points after considering all the constraints in the squark explanation and the gluino explanation respectively , and contribute 11 and 10.5 events to the excess .",

    "we can not determine which explanation is preferred to account for the excess .",
    "considering that the squark pair production rate at the lhc-14 can be greatly enhanced in comparison with that at the lhc-8 , one may expect that the squark explanation will be tested very soon at the lhc .",
    "we investigate this issue by considering the lepton-@xmath125 signal of the production at the lhc-14 . for simplicity",
    ", we assume the same cuts as those of the atlas on-@xmath7 search at the lhc-8 , and estimate the sm background of the signal . in doing this",
    ", we suppose that the dominant background at the lhc-14 comes from the same processes as those at the lhc-8 , which include flavor - symmetric backgrounds , @xmath7 + jets , rare top and diboson@xcite .",
    "since it is hard to get accurate background events by directly simulating the processes at the lhc-14 , we simulate each background process at the lhc-14 and lhc-8 separately to get the ratio of their rates after cuts , then we scale the background at the lhc-8 , which was given in the atlas report @xcite , by this ratio .",
    "we realize that the results obtained in this way may deviate significantly from their true values , but without any detailed information of the atlas detector at the lhc-14 , our results may serve as a rough estimate of the background .",
    "once we know the signal and the total background after the cuts , we can calculate the expected significance by following formulae @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 denote the event numbers for the signal and the background respectively , and the coefficient @xmath114 parameterizes the effect induced by systematic errors . in our calculation , we set @xmath129 for 14tev lhc , which was adopted at the lhc-8@xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath130 integrated luminosity at the lhc-14 , we present in table [ table ] the predictions of the points on the event number of the signal as well as that of the background .",
    "this table indicates that the signals at the lhc-14 after cuts are enhanced by more than 9 times , and by contrast the background is enhance by only about 2 times . as a result , either the squarks / gluino predicted by the points will be discovered , or in case of the non - observation of the leptonic-@xmath125 signal , the points will be excluded .",
    "moreover , comparing the squark explanation with the gluino explanation , we note that the former is more readily tested at 14tev lhc .",
    "in this paper , we intended to explain the @xmath0 excess recently reported by the atlas collaboration in the search for the leptonic-@xmath1 signal . for this end",
    ", we considered the pair production of the first two generation squarks in the nmssm with the decay chain @xmath2 . in order to maximize the signal rate and also to simplify our analysis",

    "* for the squarks as heavy as about @xmath132 , the squark pair production can still account for the excess at @xmath69 level without conflicting with any constraints . *",
    "compared with the explanation by gluino pair production , the squark explanation allows for a significantly wider range of @xmath9 as well as a less compressed susy mass spectrum .",
    "moreover , we also investigated whether the squark pair production can reproduce the distributions of the excess reported by the atlas collaboration .",
    "we found that , quite similar to the gluino pair production , the squark pair production can fit the data quite well .",

    "<S> the atlas collaboration recently reported a @xmath0 excess in the leptonic-@xmath1 channel . </S>",
    "<S> we intend to interpret this excess by squark pair production in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the decay chain we employ is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the lightest and the next - to - lightest neutralinos with singlino and bino as their dominant components respectively . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations indicate that after considering the constraints from the atlas searches for @xmath5 signal the central value of the excess can be obtained for @xmath6 , and if the constraint from the cms on-@xmath7 search is further considered , more than 10 signal events are still attainable for @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> compared with the interpretation by gluino pair production , the squark explanation allows for a significantly wider range of @xmath9 as well as a less compressed susy mass spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the squark explanation will be readily tested at the initial stage of the 14 tev lhc . </S>"
