    "the generic properties of globular clusters , which are generally considered to be free of significant amounts of dark matter , are different from those of the dark - matter - dominated dwarf galaxies .",

    "new systematic surveys for globular clusters and dwarf satellites over the last few years have generated a shift in our understanding of the connection between those two classes of objects .",

    "* ) and andromeda ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the extended luminous star clusters are found to resemble the classical globular clusters in terms of their stellar population properties , i.e. , they are generally old and metal - poor , albeit with combined structures and luminosities unlike those observed for any other globular clusters in the local group or beyond @xcite . they are found to occupy the gap in parameter space between classical ( compact ) globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies @xcite .",

    ", we report the discovery of two faint , extended globular cluster candidates in the outskirts of ngc  5128 , one of which is a high - probability old globular cluster based on direct colour - magnitude photometry .",
    "the dataset used here was initially obtained to study the resolved stellar populations in the remote outskirts of ngc  5128 , allowing us to investigate the properties of the neighborhood of the extended faint star cluster to shed light on its origin .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows : section   [ data ] briefly describes the data set , while section   [ results ] presents the properties of the reported halo globular cluster . in   [ disc ] we will discuss the present work and its implications .   [ summary ] gives the summary .    throughout the paper we use an intrinsic distance modulus for ngc 5128 of@xmath9 following the recent synthesis of five standard - candle distance calibrations given by @xcite .",
    "the foreground reddening toward the field was estimated to be @xmath10 from the all - sky map of @xcite .",
    "we have neglected the effect of any possible differential reddening across the targeted field and along the line of sight from within ngc 5128 itself , since the target field is one located in its outer halo .",
    "the differential reddening due to the galactic foreground across the @xmath11 width of an hst / acs field at this galactic latitude ( @xmath12 ) is also likely to be negligible .",
    "the imaging data we use here is the single very deep pointing obtained by @xcite with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs / wfc ) camera on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) in program go-9373 .",
    "this field , imaged in @xmath13 ( wide @xmath14 ) and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , is located at a linear projected distance of approximately @xmath0 south of the ngc 5128 center .",
    "the target field was chosen to avoid any known surface brightness anomalies such as jet - induced star - forming regions @xcite , shells and arcs @xcite , and dust lanes @xcite . the total exposure consisted of of 12 full orbits in each filter , reaching @xmath17 , @xmath18 and making this material by far the deepest photometric probe into the stellar population of ngc 5128 . in terms of limiting absolute magnitude ,",
    "it is deep enough to resolve horizontal - branch stars in the halo and to show the structure of the `` red clump '' ( the core - helium - burning stars in the colour - magnitude diagram ) .",
    "the observations and reduction techniques are fully described in @xcite and we therefore only briefly summarize this information here .",

    "we further limited the catalogue to stars with @xmath22 .",
    "for an old simple stellar population , redder stars are more metal - rich than bluer ones , and the width of the red giant branch ( rgb ) at a given luminosity is a very direct indicator of the spread in the stellar metallicity .",
    "the analysis of the properties of the age - sensitive features of the asymptotic giant branch bump and the red clump of the stellar populations in the outskirts of ngc  5128 indicates that they are predominantly old . while we can not rule out a modest age spread in these halo stars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the colour spread of the rgb stars observed in the data is due primarily to a spread in metallicity at an old mean age and can be used to derive the halo metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "stars outside of the colour - magnitude range covered by these rgb tracks were flagged and not used in subsequent analysis ( i.e. , no extrapolation beyond the validity of the models was attempted ) .",
    "the metallicity of stars on the red clump can not be interpolated from rgb tracks ; we therefore imposed a faint cut - off at @xmath27 to retain only the brighter rgb stars , which also have the advantage of being clearly brighter than the completeness limits of the data .",
    "this limit corresponds to @xmath28 , or @xmath29 , where the @xmath16-band measurement uncertainty is @xmath30 .",
    "an additional quality cut of @xmath31 was imposed to ensure that the @xmath14-band measurements were also of good quality .",
    "the overwhelming majority of stars in this outer - halo pointing are the rather uniformly distributed halo field stars .",
    "however , the long dynamical timescales of regions this far out ( 38 kpc and above ) allow the possibility that identifiable substructures , such as extended globular clusters ( gcs ) or faint satellite dwarfs might be present as well .",
    "an efficient way for revealing the presence of these stellar ( sub-)structures in the presence of heavy field contamination , especially when integrating stellar populations along a line of sight , is to investigate differences in the spatial distribution of stars with different metallicities @xcite .",
    "figure[xy_map ] shows the spatial distribution of rgb stars over the field .",
    "the sample of all the field stars is shown as small dots , while _ metal - poor _ rgb stars , i.e. , those with photometrically determined abundances [ fe / h ] @xmath32 dex , are shown as larger solid dots .",

    "5128 gcs defined by @xcite and continued in @xcite , we name this new gc candidate gc0606 .",

    "pal 14 has a scale size ( half - light radius 24 pc ) and luminosity ( @xmath34 ) that are similar to our ngc 5128 candidates ( see below ) , demonstrating that these faint , extended gcs can be discovered readily with this technique .",
    "a powerful tool to investigate the nature of the candidate is the colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of its stars .",
    "a classical globular cluster with a half - light radius of a few parsecs would subtend only a small angle : a typical half - light radius of 3pc converts to 3 acs pixels , not much larger than the 2-px full width at half maximum of the stellar point spread function .",
    "the outer parts of normal , luminous gcs will have enough stars that a cmd can be obtained ; this was first done for ngc 5128 by @xcite for the cluster c44=gc0227 , an inner - halo cluster which turned out to have moderately low metallicity from its rgb locus .",

    "a surface brightness profile of the globular cluster was generated by carrying out aperture photometry of the cluster on both the @xmath14 and @xmath16 master images .",
    "we derived the profile from _",
    "daophot / apphot _ direct concentric - aperture photometry , using the flux differences between apertures of adjacent radii to derive the surface brightness in successive annuli .",
    "a problem we faced in this analysis was the presence of a nearby very bright star , which prevented the profile from being measured further out than 16 px radius ( @xmath41 ) in @xmath16 and 26 px ( @xmath42 ) in @xmath14 .",
    "the profile fitting code of @xcite was then used to fit @xcite and @xcite profiles , numerically convolved with the stellar psf as defined from nearby bright , uncrowded stars on the frames .",
    "the best - fit results for both model profiles are shown in figure [ brightprofile ] .",
    "as is evident from the figure , the cluster is very much more extended in characteristic size than the psf , so the fitting results are insensitive to the details of the psf or any small changes it might have across the field .",
    "the center coordinates are no more certain than @xmath43 px ( @xmath44 ) on each axis .",
    "the cluster is almost entirely dominated by a large , flat central core . in the sense defined by the king models",

    "the half - light radius @xmath47 was determined by numerically integrating the psf - deconvolved king profile solutions out to large radius and then finding the projected radius enclosing half the total luminosity .",
    "lastly , we estimated central surface brightness , which is also insensitive to the details of either the profile fit or the psf because the cluster has essentially constant surface brightness within 5 px .",

    "rgb fiducials are overplotted as before .",
    "no clear sequence of rgb stars is present , but the cmd contains a few stellar objects with luminosities and colours consistent with those expected for horizontal branch stars at the distance of ngc  5128 . for comparison , the handful of faintest known gcs in the milky way such as pal 13 , pal 1 , or am4 ( all of which lie at @xmath56 integrated luminosity ) are almost entirely lacking in rgb stars brighter than the horizontal branch , to such an extent that the addition or subtraction of just one rgb star would change the total cluster luminosity very noticeably .",
    "to determine the structural parameters of the cluster candidate , which is ( mostly ) unresolved , we used _",
    "stsdas / ellipse _ to construct the empirical radial profile of light intensity out to a radius of 30 px ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "note that the circular aperture photometry leads to the same results to within the errors .",
    "as before , the comparison profile of the stellar psf was measured from adjacent bright , unsaturated , uncrowded stars .",

    "the best - fit results are shown in the right panel of figure [ faintcluster ] , with the measured parameters listed in table [ list_gc_candidates ] .",
    "as for the first extended cluster , gc0607 is almost entirely dominated by a large , flat central core .",
    "again , the central concentration and central dimensionless potential are similar to the lowest - concentration globular clusters known in the milky way .",
    "the half - light radius , the central surface brightness , and the total luminosity in each photometric band were determined in the same manner as for the first faint extended globular cluster .",
    "the difference in @xmath58 colour between gc0606 and 0607 is surprisingly large , but can be at least partly attributed to the relative dominance ( or lack ) of rgb stars brighter than the horizontal branch .",
    "gc0606 has numerous rgb stars , as seen from the colour - magnitude diagram , while gc0607 has virtually none and so its colour ( if it is indeed a gc ) would be dominated by the bluer subgiant and turnoff stars .",
    "the integrated luminosity , colour , and scale size of gc0607 are all consistent with it being an extremely faint , diffuse gc .",
    "however , further and more definitive confirmation ( such as by radial velocity measurement ) will be exceptionally hard to obtain .",
    "although we suggest that gc0607 should be kept as a plausible cluster candidate , the possibility can not be ruled out that it is a faint background galaxy .",
    "fig.[rhmv ] shows the location of the two new gc candidates we have discovered here on the structural parameter plane of half - light radius versus v - band luminosity , compared to those of the milky way @xcite , m31 @xcite and ngc  5128 @xcite shown as solid dots , asterisks , and open circles respectively .",

    "the solid line shows the equation derived by @xcite who found that only two gcs lie above this line .",
    "a constant surface luminosity of @xmath60 within the half - light radius is also shown as the dashed line .",
    "this line seperates nicely the subpopulation of extended clusters from the rest of the gc population .",
    "the gc candidates we found in ngc  5128 appear different from the populations of extended clusters recently reported in the literature .",
    "those objects are bright , i.e. , @xmath61 , while the extended clusters of ngc  5128 are much fainter matching up well , particularly the g0606 cluster , with the faint and extended cluster population in the milky way .",
    "interestingly , the group of galactic gcs with luminosities and half - light radii comparable to those of g0606 are situated all at galacto - centric distances @xmath62kpc .",
    "only one galactic gc beyond 25kpc , i.e. , palomar 13 , is not in this group of clusters .",
    "it is worth to mention that the central surface brightness of the object of the group of galactic gcs with luminosities and half - light radii similar to those of g0606 that is not encircled , i.e. , pyxis , is not available .    by examining the distribution of old globular clusters in a number of different galactic systems in the size vs. luminosity diagram ,",
    "@xcite have argued that the distribution function of globular cluster sizes is most likely bimodal .",
    "a first dominant subpopulation has half - light radii peaking at @xmath63pc , but there is a secondary subpopulation with half - light radii peaking at @xmath64pc and a dearth of gcs with half - light radii around 5pc .",
    "they suggested that this indicates the presence of two distinct modes of star cluster formation , with the less common extended clusters being primarily formed in the gravitationally smoother environment of dwarf galaxies compared to larger galaxies . an intriguing implication of this correlation is that extended and diffuse gcs in large galaxies , which tend to be found predominantly in their outer regions @xcite , may be of accretion origin . by investigating the distributions of the milky way globular cluster properties , their spatial distribution , and by comparing with those of globular clusters in dwarf galaxies ,",
    "@xcite have suggested indeed that the faint extended globular clusters in the outer galactic halo originate most likely from the disruption of now defunct dwarf companions .",
    "could the diffuse and under - luminous globular cluster we have discovered in the outskirts of ngc  5128 be the counterpart of the potentially accreted galactic outer halo extended clusters ?    if a star cluster is of accretion origin , one would expect , if the accretion event is not too old and/or the accreted stars are not fully mixed yet , that the diffuse stellar populations in its close vicinity would be different from the average halo stellar populations .",
    "the depth of our acs imaging data resolving the stellar content of the halo down to the core helium burning stars gives us the opportunity to investigate the properties of the diffuse stellar populations in the immediate neighborhood of the extended globular cluster .",
    "the acs image contains many large background galaxies , as well as several bright stars ( see fig.1 of @xcite ) whose `` halos '' cause localised holes in the star - counts map .",
    "a mask was constructed by choosing suitably large elliptical areas around these problematic regions .",
    "we have binned the stars in a @xmath65 grid in order for each super - pixel to contain @xmath66 sources ( to have signal to noise ratio s / n@xmath67 ) .",
    "each superpixel is thus @xmath68 wide or 314 parsecs projected width .",
    "only stars outside of the masked regions were kept .",
    "a detailed and quantitative analysis of the spatial sub - structures over the acs field is deferred to a subsequent contribution , but it is worth mentioning here that the stellar surface density of rgb stars over the field shows no obvious coherent stellar structure that might indicate the presence of streams or shells of stellar debris .",
    "figure [ map_median_feh ] shows the two - dimensional map of the median values of metallicity of rgb stars calculated in the super - pixel grid . for reference , the extended globular cluster discussed in the present paper",
    "is located within the most metal - poor super - pixel , the dark blue spot of figure [ map_median_feh ] .",
    "the random errors on the median metallicities in the super - pixels , due to both photometric uncertainties and population sampling effects , estimated as described in full details in @xcite , are small , i.e. , typically @xmath69  dex .",
    "a striking feature of the median stellar metallicity map is the large pixel - to - pixel variation , much larger than the typical random uncertainties .",
    "it is worth noting that those small - scale chemical variations have no obvious correspondence in the stellar density map . due to the virtually negligible contamination from foreground or background sources ,",
    "the present observations are extremely sensitive to the presence of sub - structures .",
    "it is in principle possible with the acs to detect a population of @xmath70 rgb stars scattered over a volume of many hundred cubic kpc , making it much easier to detect sub - structures from spatial metallicity variations rather than from the enhancement they cause in the stellar density map ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details ) .",
    "the outer regions of ngc  5128 have been found to be predominantly populated by moderately metal - rich stars , with an average metallicity of @xmath71\\sim -0.5}$ ] and only @xmath72 of the stellar populations more metal - poor than @xmath71\\approx -1}$ ] @xcite .",
    "a gradient of the median metallicity is apparent in the median metallicity map , with the top half of the acs field being more metal - poor than the lower half .",
    "as discussed at length by @xcite , the metallicity distribution function of the overall stellar populations at @xmath73kpc is very similar in term of its shape , average metallicity , and metallicity dispersion , to those determined at @xmath74 and @xmath75 kpc respectively from the centre of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "no detectable radial metallicity gradient is present in the outskirts of ngc  5128 , at least in the range of radial distances probed .",
    "the detected median metallicity gradient within the acs field at @xmath73kpc from the centre of the galaxy should thus not reflect a global metallicity gradient , which would give unreasonably high metallicities if extrapolated inward .",
    "the median stellar metallicity gradient is most likely related to localised chemical variations that have not yet been fully blended into the diffuse smooth halo .",
    "the spatial correspondence and the similar metallicities between the small - scale chemical variations and the extended globular cluster suggest that this object is likely to be related to the same event that has led to the formation of the localised chemical variations .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a discovery and discussion of two new globular cluster candidates in the outer region ( @xmath76kpc from the centre ) of the nearest giant elliptical ngc  5128 using very deep hst / acs imagery .",
    "the first and brightest of these two objects is selected based on both the presence of a clear rgb sequence and its structural parameters .",
    "the second one was selected solely on basis of its morphological appearance , colour and luminosity , and its structural parameters .",
    "the properties of the bright cluster are consistent with its identification as an old , intermediate - metallicity globular clusters resembling in every way we can verify the faint and extended clusters populating the milky way outer halo .",
    "this is the first time a counterpart of this populations of galactic globular clusters has been reported for any other galaxy .",
    "the combined properties of the extended clusters and the diffuse stellar halo are consistent with the view that the reported clusters were once associated with dwarf galaxies that have disrupted .",
    "finally , our present work indicates that a search for faint , extended globular clusters in ngc 5128 is entirely feasible . by carefully searching just one deep acs / wfc imaging field  which in this context is essentially a random pointing in the halo",
    " we have successfully identified two very probable gc candidates and characterized their structural parameters .",
    "extrapolating from just this one field of area 11.5 arcmin@xmath77 to the entire ngc 5128 halo area would be extremely risky , but it is worth noting that the milky way has more than a dozen known gcs fainter than @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "ngc 5128 is a more luminous galaxy by an order of magnitude , so it seems quite likely that its vast outer halo should hold some hundreds of faint gcs awaiting discovery , along with their attendant substructures .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of an extended globular cluster in a halo field in centaurus a ( ngc  5128 ) , situated @xmath0 from the centre of that galaxy , imaged with the advanced camera for surveys on board the hubble space telescope . at the distance of the galaxy , the half - light radius of the cluster is @xmath1 , placing it among the largest globular clusters known . </S>",
    "<S> the faint absolute magnitude of the star cluster , @xmath2 , and its large size render this object somewhat different from the population of extended globular clusters previously reported , making it the first firm detection in the outskirts of a giant galaxy of an analogue of the faint , diffuse globular clusters present in the outer halo of the milky way . </S>",
    "<S> the colour - magnitude diagram of the cluster , covering approximately the brightest four magnitudes of the red giant branch , is consistent with an ancient , i.e. , @xmath3 , intermediate - metallicity , i.e. , @xmath4\\sim -1.0 dex}$ ] , stellar population . </S>",
    "<S> we also report the detection of a second , even fainter cluster candidate which would have @xmath5 , and @xmath6 if it is at the distance of ngc  5128 . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of the extended globular cluster and the diffuse stellar populations in its close vicinity suggest that they are part of a low mass accretion in the outer regions of ngc  5128 .    </S>",
