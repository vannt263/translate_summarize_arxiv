    "it is of great interest for solar as well as stellar astrophysicists to compare the activity of our sun to those of a number of other similar solar - type stars , since it may provide us with an opportunity to infer the trend of solar activity on a very long astronomical time scale ( i.e. , investigating the long - time behavior of a star may be replaced by studying many similar stars at a given time ) .",
    "baliunas and jastrow ( 1990 ) argued based on the results of mt .",
    "wilson observatory s hk survey project for 74 solar - type stars that the distribution of @xmath3-index ( nearly equivalent to @xmath4 ; i.e. , the ratio of integrated core - flux of ca  ii hk lines to the continuum flux ; cf .",
    "vaughan et al .",
    "1978 ) is bimodal , with about 1/3 showing appreciably smaller activities than the sun , which they interpreted as being in the `` maunder - minimum '' state of activity .",
    "if this is true , it may mean that the spotless phase of considerably low - activity such as occurred in late 17th century in our sun ( eddy 1976 ) may not necessarily be an unusual phenomenon in the long run .",
    "however , this result could not be confirmed by a similar analysis done by hall and lockwood ( 2004 ) , who reported based on many repeated observations of ca  ii h and k lines for 57 sun - like stars along with the sun at lowell observatory that such a bimodal distribution of @xmath3-index ( as suggesting the existence of a considerable fraction of appreciably lower activity stars than the current sun ) is not observed ; actually , even the @xmath3-values of 10 `` flat - activity '' stars turned out to be comparable with ( or somewhat larger than ) the typical solar - minimum value .    furthermore , wright ( 2004 ) pointed out an important problem in baliunas and jastrow s ( 1990 ) sample selection .",
    "he concluded by examining the absolute magnitudes of their sample based on hipparcos parallaxes that many of those `` maunder - minimum stars '' with considerably low @xmath3 indices are old stars evolved - off the main sequence , which suggests that their apparently low activity is nothing but due to the aging effect without any relevance to the cyclic or irregular change of activity in solar - type dwarfs .",
    "thus , fairly speaking , the original claim by baliunas and jastrow ( 1990 ) appears to be rather premature and difficult to be justified from the viewpoint of these recent studies .",
    "yet , the issue of clarifying the status of solar activity among sun - like stars does not seem to have been fully settled and further investigations still remain to be done : +  first , since understanding the activity of the sun from a comprehensive perspective is in question , comparison samples should comprise stars as closer to the sun as possible . admittedly , those authors surely paid attention to this point : baliunas and jastrow s ( 1990 ) hk project targets were in the @xmath5 range of 0.600.76 , while hall and lockwood s ( 2004 ) sun - like stars sample were chosen from stars of @xmath6 , both narrowly encompassing the solar @xmath7 of 0.65 ( cox 2000 ) .",
    "however , the homogeneity of these samples are not yet satisfactory .",
    "could they be made up of further more sun - like stars or solar analogs ? +  second , it appears that the precision of detecting low - level activity has been insufficient .",
    "although mt .",
    "wilson @xmath3 index reflects the core - emission strength ( equivalent width ) of ca  ii hk lines , it would not be a sensitive activity indicator any more , when the emission becomes weak , as it stabilizes at a constant value determined by the photospheric absorption profile . while an indicator for the pure - emission strength , @xmath8 ; where @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) , has also been introduced to rectify this shortcoming and widely used , the photospheric component @xmath11 is in most cases only roughly evaluated as a simple function of @xmath5 ( e.g. , noyes et al .",
    "1984 ) and thus its accuracy is rather questionable .",
    "wright ( 2004 ) also pointed out the importance of correctly subtracting this component , in view of its possible dependence on other stellar parameters ( i.e. , not only on @xmath5 or @xmath12 , but also on @xmath13 and [ fe / h ] ) .",
    "these requirements motivated us to conduct a new investigation on this subject , since we have been engaged these years with the extensive study of 118 sun - like stars selected by the criteria of @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ; cox 2000 ) , a quantitatively as well as qualitatively ideal sample of solar - analog stars .",
    "this project was originally started for the purpose of clarifying the behavior of li abundances ( @xmath17(li ) ) , and revealed that the rotational velocity ( @xmath18 ) is the most influential key parameter ( takeda et al .",
    "2007 ; hereinafter referred to as paper i ) . in a successive study , we investigated the activities of these solar analogs by using the residual flux at the core of the ca  ii 8542 line ( @xmath19(8542 ) ) , and confirmed a clear correlation between @xmath17(li ) , @xmath18 , and @xmath19(8542 ) , as expected ( takeda et al .",
    "2010 ; hereinafter referred to as paper ii ) .",
    "however , it turned out hard to discriminate the differences in @xmath19(8542 ) when the activity is as low as that of the sun , since it tends to get settled at @xmath20 and does not serve as a sensitive indicator any more . actually , test calculations of non - lte line formation suggested ( cf .",
    "appendix b in paper ii ) that the core flux of the ca  ii 8498/8542/8662 triplet lines are rather inert to the chromospheric temperature rise in the upper atmosphere when the activity is low , but that for the ca  ii 3934/3968 doublet ( h+k lines ) is still sensitive and thus more advantageous for detecting the low - level activity .",
    "then , we recently studied the be abundances of these sample stars by using the be  ii 3131 line based on the near - uv spectra obtained with subaru / hds ( takeda et al .",
    "2011 ; hereinafter referred to as paper iii ) .",
    "since these hds spectra fortunately cover the ca  ii h+k lines in the violet region , we decided to reinvestigate the activities of these 118 sun - like stars by measuring the core - emission strength of the ca  ii 3934 ( k ) line , in order to clarify the activity status of our sun in comparison with similar solar analogs , where special attention was given to correctly removing the background line profile computed from the solar photospheric model , while taking advantage of the fact that atmospheric parameters of all these targets are well established .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to report the outcome of this investigation .",
    "we use the same targets ( 118 solar analogs ) as used in papers i  iii , which were selected by the criteria of having @xmath5 and @xmath21 values sufficiently similar to those of the sun ( @xmath22  0.20.3 and @xmath23 ) . see",
    "section 2 in paper i for a detailed description about the sample selection .",
    "we also determined the atmospheric parameters ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath24 , and [ fe / h ] ) from the equivalent widths of fe lines , and the stellar parameters ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) by comparing the positions on the hr diagram with the theoretical evolutionary tracks ( cf . section 3 in paper i ) .",
    "these parameters for most of the targets were actually confirmed to proximally distribute around the solar values ( i.e. , @xmath27  k , @xmath28  dex , @xmath29  km  s@xmath30 , @xmath31}|\\ltsim 0.2 $ ]  dex , @xmath32 , and @xmath33  dex ; cf .",
    "figures 4 and 5 in paper i ) .    however , the following characteristics regarding the relations between these parameters are to be noted , which we had better bear in mind in discussing the behavior of stellar activities . +",
    " since the effect of a decreased metallicity on @xmath5 is compensated by a lowering of @xmath12 , several outlier stars with appreciably lower @xmath12 as well as [ fe / h ] ( @xmath34  k and [ fe / h ]  @xmath35  dex ) are included in our sample ( cf .",
    "figure 4c in paper i ) , such as hip  26381 , hip  39506 , hip  40118 , and hip  113989 ; and they belong to the oldest group ( @xmath36  yr ) .",
    "+  these parameters are not independent from each other and some correlations appear to exist between specific combinations ; such as @xmath26 vs. @xmath12 ( lower @xmath12 stars tend to be older ) , @xmath26 vs. [ fe / h ] ( lower [ fe / h ] stars tend be older ) , @xmath25 vs. @xmath26 ( lower - mass stars tend to be older ) , and @xmath24 vs. @xmath12 ( @xmath24 tends to decrease with a lowered @xmath12 ) , as recognized from figure 5 or figure 10 in paper i , though the existence of outlier stars mentioned above partly plays a role in these tendencies .    it should also be remarked that the data for hip  41484 given in paper i were incorrect , as reported in appendix a of paper ii , where the correct results derived from a reanalysis of this star are presented .",
    "the spectroscopic observations of these 118 solar analogs and vesta ( substitute for the sun ) were carried out on 2009 august 6 , 2009 november 27 , 2010 february 4 , and 2010 may 24 ( hawaii standard time ) , with the high dispersion spectrograph ( hds ; noguchi et al .",
    "2002 ) placed at the nasmyth platform of the 8.2-m subaru telescope atop mauna kea , by which we obtained high - dispersion spectra covering @xmath37  30004600  @xmath38 with a resolving power of @xmath39 .",
    "see section 2 of paper iii and electronic table e1 therein for details of the observations and the data reduction , as well as the basic data of the spectra ( e.g. , observing date , exposure time , s / n ratio at @xmath40 ) .",
    "the counts of raw echelle spectra ( including the effect of blaze function ) around @xmath41 ( the broad maximum between the two large depressions of ca  ii 3934 ( k ) and 3968 ( h ) lines ) are typically about @xmath42 times as large as those at the uv region of @xmath40 , while the counts at core of the ca  ii k line at 3934  @xmath38 is about @xmath43 of those at @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , the s / n ratio at the deep absorption core of the k line is not much different from the value at @xmath40 given in electronic table e1 of paper iii ; that is , on the order of s / n  @xmath44 .",
    "most activity studies of solar - type stars so far based on the core emission strengths of ca  ii resonance lines appear to utilize both k ( 3934  @xmath38 ) and h ( 3968  @xmath38 ) lines , presumably due to the intention of reducing the systematic errors by averaging both two , since measurements tend to be done rather roughly by directly integrating raw spectra at the specified wavelength regions .    in this investigation , however , we focus only on the former k line at 3933.66  @xmath38 , since ( 1 ) it is by two times stronger than the h line and thus comparatively more suitable as a probe of the condition at the optically - thin chromospheric layer , and ( 2 ) the latter ca  ii h line at 3968.47  @xmath38 is blended with the balmer line ( h@xmath45 at 3970.07  @xmath38 ) which would make the situation more complicated in simulating the photospheric profile to be subtracted .",
    "our spectra in the selected wavelength region ( 39303937  @xmath38 ) including the relevant ca  ii  k line are shown in figures 1 ( vesta / sun ) , 2 ( all 118 stars including vesta / sun ) , and 3 ( all stars overplotted ) , where the continuum levels of the observed spectra are so adjusted as to match the theoretical ones as explained below .",
    "we can see from these figures that the strengths of core emission considerably vary from star to star , while that for the sun is apparently weak .",
    "( 80mm,60mm)figure1.eps    ( 80mm,60mm)figure3.eps      given that the very strong ca  ii k and h lines with considerably extended damping wings are predominant at @xmath37  39004000  @xmath38 , it is hopeless to empirically establish the continuum position from the observed spectrum @xmath46 ( where an echelle order covers only @xmath47  @xmath38 ) .",
    "we thus `` adjusted '' the continuum position ( @xmath48 ) of the spectrum ( judged by eye - inspection ) in such a way that @xmath49 satisfactorily matches the theoretically calculated residual flux @xmath50 ) defined by @xmath51 , with which the effective temperature @xmath12 is related as @xmath52 ( @xmath53 : stephan  boltzmann constant ) . ] in the inner wing of the line ( within @xmath54  23  @xmath38 from the line center , excepting the core - emission region ) .",
    "an example of such an accomplished match is displayed in figure 1 for the case of the sun ( vesta ) .",
    "regarding the computation of theoretical spectra , we used kurucz s ( 1993 ) width9 program , which was modified by y. takeda to enable spectrum synthesis by including many lines .",
    "as to the atomic line data , we invoked kurucz and bell s ( 1995 ) compilation and included all available lines in the relevant region .",
    "in particular , the data for the ca  ii k line at 3933.663  @xmath38 of our primary concern are as follows : @xmath55 = 0.00  ev , @xmath56 , @xmath57 [ radiation damping width ( s@xmath30 ) ] , @xmath58 [ stark effect damping width ( s@xmath30 ) per electron density ( @xmath59 ) at @xmath60  k ] , and @xmath61 [ van der waals damping width ( s@xmath30 ) per hydrogen density ( @xmath59 ) at @xmath60  k ] . since the atmospheric parameters ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , [ fe / h ] , and @xmath24 ) are already established ( as summarized in table 1 ) , the model atmosphere for each star was generated by 3-dimensionally interpolating kurucz s ( 1993 ) atlas9 model grids ( lte , plane - parallel model ) in terms of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and [ fe / h ] . then , the synthetic spectrum was computed by using the relevant atmospheric model along with the metallicity - scaled abundances ( for all elements including ca ; i.e. , [ x / h ] = [ fe / h ] for any x ) as well as the microturbulence ( @xmath24 ) , and further broadened according to the macrobroadening parameter determined in paper iii .      now that the theoretical photospheric background profile ( @xmath62 ) used for subtraction",
    "has been successfully fitted with @xmath63 by appropriately adjusting the continuum position , we can calculate the absolute emission flux ( @xmath64 ) at the k - line core originating from the chromosphere ( i.e. , after subtraction of the photospheric component ) as @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 defining the integration range were chosen to be 3932.8 and 3934.6  @xmath38 , respectively ( cf . figure 1 ) . in order to demonstrate how this subtraction process works well , the photospheric profile ( @xmath62 ) at [ @xmath66 , @xmath67 ]",
    "is displayed by red dashed line ( along with the observed spectrum shown by symbols ) for each star in figure 2 .",
    "finally , we can obtain @xmath69 ( the ratio of the chromospheric emission flux at the k line to the total bolometric flux ) as @xmath70 the resulting @xmath71 values for each of the 118 solar analogs ( + sun ) are presented in table 1 , where other activity - related quantities ( @xmath19(8542 ) and @xmath18 ) determined in paper ii are also given , along with the li / be abundances and stellar parameters established in papers i and iii .",
    "we would like to remark here that the `` absolute '' values of @xmath69 are not very meaningful in the low - activity regime because of the uncertainties in its zero - point .",
    "that is , the theoretical profile we have computed for subtraction of the background photospheric component is by no means uniquely defined .",
    "actually , apparently different results may be obtained depending on how it is calculated .",
    "this situation is demonstrated in figure 1 for the solar case . the solar atmospheric model ( which was obtained by interpolating the grids of kurucz s atlas9 model atmospheres ) we adopted for calculating the lte photospheric profile ( red line ) has its surface at @xmath73 ( @xmath74  k ) .",
    "however , we note that the same but simply extrapolated model up to @xmath75 ( @xmath76  k ) yields an appreciably deeper core ( upper blue line ) , reflecting the fact that the residual flux at the center is determined by @xmath77 ( @xmath78 : photospheric temperature ) and very sensitive to @xmath79 in this violet region where wien s approximation nearly holds . moreover , the core of the non - lte profile ( simulated by using the departure coefficients computed in paper ii for the case of model e ; cf .",
    "appendix b therein ) gets even more deeper approaching a completely dark core ( lower blue line ) . besides , the core shape strongly depends on the turbulent velocity field in the upper atmosphere ; e.g. , compare the non - lte profile in figure 1 ( computed with a depth - independent microturbulence of 1  km  s@xmath30 ) with that for model e depicted in figure b.1(b ) of paper ii ( where a variable microturbulent velocity field increasing with height was adopted ) .    accordingly",
    ", @xmath69 values [ equation ( 2 ) ] may be uncertain by an arbitrary constant , because @xmath80 in equation ( 1 ) can have different values depending on how @xmath62 is computed , though `` relative '' differences between @xmath69 values of each star are surely meaningful as long as they are evaluated in the same system .",
    "therefore , we should keep in mind that comparison of absolute values of our @xmath69 with those of similar @xmath1 parameters derived by other groups , which we will try in subsection 4.1 , is not much meaningful when the low - activity region ( e.g. , @xmath81 ) is concerned .",
    "( on the other hand , such a zero - point problem should not be so serious for higher - activity cases , where @xmath71 tends to be dominated by the emission component and the role of @xmath62 subtraction is less significant . ) in any event , we consider that our choice of shallower @xmath62 is adequate , since it leads to smaller values of @xmath69 ( as a result of larger subtraction ) , which eventually realizes a larger contrast in the @xmath71 values of low - activity stars .",
    "the @xmath71 values determined in subsection 3.3 are compared with the equivalent activity indices and @xmath82 , we could convert their @xmath83 $ ] ( as clearly defined by them ) into @xmath84 which is directly comparable with our @xmath69 .",
    "meanwhile , the @xmath85 data derived by wright et al.s ( 2004 ) as well as isaacson and fischer ( 2010 ) appear to be essentially the _ average _ ( not the sum ) of @xmath86 and @xmath87 as judged by their extents . therefore , we should be cautious about different definitions in the meaning of @xmath85 .",
    "this situation is manifestly displayed in figure 7 of paper ii , where we can see that @xmath85(strassmeier ) is systematically larger than @xmath85(wright ) by 0.3  dex .",

    "these figures reveal almost the same tendency of correlation between our @xmath90 and those of three studies : the agreement at @xmath91 is mostly good , though our @xmath90 tends to be slightly larger by @xmath92  dex for high - activity stars of @xmath93 .",
    "meanwhile , a distinct difference is observed at the low - activity region where their @xmath90 values tend to settle down at @xmath94 , while ours are dispersed over @xmath95 .",
    "admittedly , there is not much meaning in comparing the absolute @xmath1 values of different systems with each other , as remarked in subsection 3.4 .",
    "the important point is , however , that we could detect the subtle difference in the low - level activity by measuring the weak core - emission at ca  ii k with a careful subtraction of the background photospheric profile , while such a precision for distinguishing the delicate difference in the weak emission strength could not be accomplished by comparatively rough measurements in those previous studies .",

    "this is just what we have expected ( cf .",
    "appendix b in paper ii ) , and demonstrates the superiority of the ca  ii hk core emission ( as long as correctly measured ) to the line - center residual flux of ca  ii 8542 when it comes to investigating the activities of solar - type stars as low as the sun .",

    "figure 5c of paper ii ) , the anti - correlation is more clearly ( or less unambiguously , to say the least ) recognized in the present case , thanks to the extended dynamic range of the activity indicator for low - activity stars , though the dispersion is still considerably large .    how the abundances of li and be depend on @xmath69 determined in this study",

    "however , since these 4 stars have appreciably different @xmath71 from each other ( @xmath103 ; cf . figure 6a@xmath104 ) and are not necessarily less active than the sun , this speculation does not seem likely .",

    "we note here that ( 1 ) three ( out of only five in our sample of 118 stars ) planet - host stars are included , ( 2 ) all these stars have low - scale li abundances ( @xmath17(li )  @xmath134 ) , and ( 3 ) their ages are similar to or older than that of the sun . combining these facts with the consequences in papers i and ii , we consider that these stars have actually low activities even compared with the solar - minimum level , and this is presumably attributed to their intrinsically slow rotation ( which is closely related with the li abundance as well as with the existence of giant planets ) .",
    "it is , therefore , interesting to investigate the variabilities of these low - activity stars by long - term monitoring observations , in order to see how their activities behave with time ( cyclic ? flat ? irregular ? ) .",
    "admittedly , activity observations for these stars have been reported in several published studies so far , for example : hip  7918 , 53721 , 64150 , and 96901 by duncan et al .",
    "( 1991 ) ; hip  53721 , 59610 , 64150 , and 96901 by wright et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ; hip  7918 , 53721 , and 96901 by hall et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ; hip  31965 , 59610 , 64150 , and 96901 by isaacson and fischer ( 2010 ) . however , as they are still quantitatively insufficient for establishing the long - term behavior of their activities , much more observations are evidently needed .",
    "there have been several arguments regarding the status of solar activity among similar sun - like stars . which began with the implication of baliunas and jastrow ( 1990 ) based on their mt .",
    "wilson hk survey project that a considerable portion ( @xmath135 ) of solar - type stars have activities significantly lower than the present - day sun , which they called `` maunder - minimum stars . ''",
    "however , their conclusion could not be confirmed by hall and lockwood s ( 2004 ) follow - up study , and wright ( 2004 ) criticized the reality of such considerably low - active solar - type stars by pointing out that most of them are not so much dwarfs as evolved subgiants .",
    "given this controversial situation , we decided to contend with this problem by ourselves based on carefully selected sample of 118 solar - analogs sufficiently similar to each other ( which we already investigated their stellar parameters as well as li / be abundances in a series of our previous papers ) , with a special attention being paid to reliably evaluating their activities down to a considerably low level .    practically , we measured the emission strength at the core of ca  ii 3933.663 line ( k line ) on the high - dispersion spectrogram obtained by subaru / hds , where we gave effort to correctly evaluating the pure emission component by removing the wing - fitted photospheric profile calculated from the classical solar model atmosphere , which enabled us to detect low - level activities down to @xmath101 .    a comparison of our @xmath71 results with the corresponding @xmath90 values of strassmeier et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , wright et al . ( 2004 ) , and isaacson and fischer ( 2010 ) revealed that low - active stars ( for which they derived @xmath136 at the minimum limit ) actually have a dispersion of @xmath137  dex ( @xmath138 ) in our measurement , suggesting that our @xmath71 has a higher sensitivity and thus advantageous .",
    "a similar situation holds regarding the comparison with @xmath19(8542 ) we used in paper ii ; i , e . , this index stabilizes at @xmath20 and becomes insensitive for low - active stars in contrast to @xmath71 .    as another merit of using @xmath71",
    ", we can state that the visibility of the @xmath17(li)activity relation as well as the age ",
    "activity relation becomes comparatively clearer , because this activity index turns out to have well diversified values for low - activity stars thanks to its high sensitivity , which can not be accomplished by using , e.g. , @xmath19(8542 ) .    from the distribution histogram of @xmath71",
    ", we could recognize a clear vaughan ",
    "preston gap between two peaks at @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "our result of @xmath139 manifestly suggests that the sun belongs to the group of the former peak and has a distinctly low - active nature among solar analogs .",
    "actually , a fraction of stars with @xmath140 is only @xmath43 .",
    "this consequence exclude the possibility for the existence of a considerable fraction ( e.g. , @xmath135 ) of `` maunder - minimum stars '' such that having activities significantly lower than the current solar - minimum level as once suggested by baliunas and jastrow ( 1990 ) .",
    "yet , some stars ( only a minor fraction of the sample ) do exist showing activities still lower than that of the solar - minimum level .",
    "having examined such 8 low - activity stars , we found that they tend to include planet - host stars and have low li abundances , from which we suspect that their activities are actually low as a result of intrinsically slow rotation .",
    "it would be an important task to clarify the behavior of their activity variations by long - term monitoring observations .",
