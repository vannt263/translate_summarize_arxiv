    "the currently preferred cosmological model , the @xmath6cdm model , is characterized by a pressureless dark - matter ( dm ) component with an energy density @xmath0 , which decays with the third power of the cosmic scale factor @xmath8 and a constant energy density @xmath9 , attributed to a cosmological constant @xmath6 .",
    "alternative models , as far as they remain in the context of friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) models , replace @xmath9 by a ( not necessarily constant ) @xmath1 , the energy density of dark energy ( de ) , equipped with an equation - of - state ( eos ) parameter @xmath10 which may be time dependent . together , dm and de form a  dark sector \" which makes up about 95% of the present cosmic energy budget and which therefore dominates the cosmological dynamics . in the simplest case , following the @xmath6cdm paradigm , dm and de are considered to be independent entities , governed by separate conservation laws .",
    "the more general case is , however , not to exclude the possibility of a non - gravitational coupling between these both components which results in a richer structure of the dark sector .",
    "moreover , it has been demonstrated , that ignoring a potentially existing interaction may lead to an incorrect interpretation of cosmological observations @xcite . since neither the physical nature of de nor",
    "that of dm are known , these models are necessarily phenomenological . since they differ from the standard @xmath6cdm model they are useful to test potential deviations from the latter . while for the homogeneous and isotropic background dynamics a lot of models do fit the observations , their different perturbation dynamics may serve to limit the number of seriously competing approaches .",
    "there exists a large body of literature in which non - gravitational interactions between de and dm are considered .",
    "a subclass of these activities is devoted to models of de which keep an eos parameter @xmath11 as in the standard model , but generalize the latter insofar as @xmath1 is admitted to be time dependent .",
    "these models are also called decaying @xmath6 models @xcite .",
    "our aim here is to study in this context the perturbation dynamics of a model in which dm and de interact in such a way that the ratio of their energy densities obeys a power - law in the scale factor , i.e. @xmath12 , where @xmath3 is a constant parameter .",
    "such model was proposed by dalal et al .",
    "@xcite to address the coincidence problem .",
    "independently of whether or not one considers this problem to be really a problem , the ansatz by dalal et al . gives rise to a testable alternative cosmological dynamics which contains the standard model as a limiting case .",
    "various aspects of the background dynamics of this model have been studied so far and were confronted with observational data @xcite .",
    "this model is different from most other interacting models insofar as the interaction term is proportional to the product of the energy densities of de and dm , i.e. , the interaction is nonlinear .",
    "most approaches in the literature deal with an interaction linear in the energy density of one of the components ( see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "but in its original form its validity is restricted to the homogeneous and isotropic background .",
    "the dynamics depends directly on the scale factor which is not a covariant quantity . here",
    "we present a covariant generalization of this model and complement previous investigations by a gauge - invariant perturbation analysis . to this purpose",
    "the scale factor is replaced by a general , covariantly defined length scale which under the conditions of homogeneity and isotropy reduces to the scale factor .",

    "unified models continue to be discussed as potential alternatives to the @xmath6cdm model . in our case",
    "@xmath205 is a free parameter and we shall discard models for which @xmath205 is larger than the mentioned threshold value @xmath218 .",
    "now , the @xmath227 in the expression ( [ chi2 ] ) represent the lss dr9 data @xcite , while @xmath181 is the theoretically calculated matter power spectrum @xmath226 .",
    "the set of free parameters is @xmath228 .",
    "we have used the publicly available dr9 data covariance matrix and restricted the wavenumber to the range @xmath229 for which a linear approximation seems appropriate .    to avoid the mentioned unwanted and non - observed oscillations very small values of @xmath205 are required . for our calculations",
    "we take @xmath230 .",
    "such value will ensure the absence of oscillations until @xmath231 , equivalent to a scale of @xmath232 .",
    "hence , we continue our analysis with only two free parameters , namely @xmath70 and @xmath3 . minimizing the @xmath172-function under this condition we find the best - fit values visualized in the @xmath70-@xmath3 plane of fig .",
    "the continuous contour lines represent the @xmath200 and @xmath201 confidence levels .",
    "we performed also a joint analysis by using the combined snia + lss data where @xmath233 .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] as well , where the grey color represents the region between the @xmath200 and @xmath201 cls .",
    "the best - fit values for the combined analysis are summarized in table 1 .",
    "there is a tendency for @xmath152 , i.e. , for an energy transfer from dm to de . while the jla data alone show a big degeneracy , the latter is largely removed by the large - scale - structure data . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we present four different curves .",
    "curve 1 is the best - fit model for the dr9 data set .",
    "it has @xmath234 , @xmath235 and @xmath236 .",
    "curve 2 represents the best - fit model for the combined dr9+jla data .",
    "the best - fit values are @xmath234 , @xmath237 and @xmath238 . note that curve 1 and curve 2 are indistinguishable . to countercheck these results",
    "we have also chosen two parameter combinations from outside the @xmath239cl solid contour : curve 3 is based on @xmath240 and @xmath241 and has a @xmath242 for the joint dr9+jla data .",
    "the same model has a @xmath243 when only dr9 data are considered .",
    "curve 4 is constructed with @xmath244 and @xmath245 and has a @xmath246 when the combined dr9+jla data sets are used . for dr9 data",
    "only one has @xmath247 .",
    "the fit to these values outside the @xmath201 contour is indeed considerably worse which supports our analysis .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally , with the known best - fit values we can infer the upper and lower bounds for the interaction strength . these values are presented in the outer right column of table 1 .",
    "as already mentioned , there is a tendency to values @xmath152 which corresponds to @xmath248 , equivalent to a transfer of energy from dm to de .",
    "qualitatively , this is in accordance with the results in @xcite and @xcite which are based on an interaction linear in the de energy density . on the other hand ,",
    "thermodynamic considerations prefer @xmath52 to be positive @xcite .      but not for smaller values.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]",
    "with the intention to quantify and , possibly , to soften the coincidence problem , @xcite introduced a phenomenological parameter @xmath3 that governs the dynamics of the ratio of the energy densities of dm and de .",
    "independently of whether one takes the coincidence problem seriously , the resulting cosmological dynamics represents a simple , testable modification of the standard model .",
    "-@xmath3 plane for the scaling model .",
    "continuous contour lines represent the @xmath200 and @xmath201 cl based on the dr9 data sample .",
    "for comparison we have also included the results for the jla sample ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the grey region represents the @xmath200 and @xmath201 cl for the joint analysis jla+dr9.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    starting point of this approach is not , as usual , an expression for the interaction between dm and de but the mentioned dynamics of the energy - density ratio which can be compared with that of the @xmath6cdm model in a transparent manner . any deviation from the standard dynamics",
    "is then traced back to a specific coupling between dm and de .",
    "different from most models discussed so far , this coupling is nonlinear , i.e. , the interaction quantity @xmath52 contains a product of the energy densities of dm and de .",
    "most other interacting models are just linear in the de density . for @xmath56 and @xmath11 the @xmath6cdm model is recovered .",
    "any combination @xmath249 corresponds to a non - gravitational interaction between dm and de .",
    "any value @xmath250 is considered to make the coincidence problem less severe .",
    "this model was tested against observational data in @xcite . however , in its original form and in the studies so far its validity is restricted to the homogeneous and isotropic background dynamics .",
    "here we generalized this model to enable a study of the perturbation dynamics as well . to this purpose",
    "we replaced the scale factor in the model defining relation by a more general covariantly defined length scale which reduces to the scale factor in the appropriate limit .",
    "we performed a gauge - invariant first - order perturbation analysis which enabled us to obtain the fractional matter density perturbations as a combination from a coupled system of equations for the total and relative perturbations .",
    "like in other de models , the effective non - adiabatic sound velocity has to be smaller than a certain threshold value to avoid ( unobserved ) oscillations in the matter perturbations . within a @xmath251 analysis and focusing on the case of perturbed vacuum energy @xmath11",
    ", the resulting matter power spectrum was confronted with data from the sdss dr9 survey .",
    "we studied the dependence of the power spectrum on the values of the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the results for the background dynamics were improved considerably compared with a previous study .",
    "using the jla data alone results in a large degeneracy in the @xmath70-@xmath3 plane which does not allow for a definite conclusion concerning the sign of the interaction .",
    "this degeneracy is substantially reduced by the dr9 large - scale - structure data which prefer @xmath252 .",
    "this corresponds to an energy transfer from dm to de .",
    "the @xmath6cdm model with @xmath56 is compatible with our analysis at the @xmath201 confidence level .",
    "finally we remark that for a more realistic study of matter clustering on smaller scales in the presence of de and for a better understanding of the role of @xmath205 in structure formation a nonlinear treatment is necessary .",
    "processes as virialization and spherical collapse which were outside the scope of the present paper have necessarily to be considered .",
    "we hope to come back to this in future work .",
    "further constraints on our nonlinear model are expected from cmb data .",
    "this is currently under investigation .      for several values of @xmath3 ,",
