    "the activity of magnetars is explained by their crustal motions that twist the neutron star magnetosphere ( thompson et al .",
    "2002 ) and ignite electron - positron discharge ( beloborodov & thompson 2007 ) . the continual @xmath0 flow around the magnetar generates the observed hard x - ray emission ( beloborodov 2013 ; an et al . 2013 ; hascot et al .  2013 ) .",
    "magnetospheric twisting also explains the variable spindown rate and may be responsible for triggering flares ( thompson & duncan 1996 ; lyutikov 2006 ; parfrey et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "theoretical calculations show that a magnetospheric twist dissipates in a few years , in agreement with the timescale of flux decay in transient magnetars ( e.g. mereghetti 2008 ) and observations of slowly shrinking hot spots ( gotthelf & halpern 2007 ; beloborodov 2011 ) .",
    "the twist injection must occur faster than dissipation , so the twist is created by crustal motions with vorticity @xmath1  rad  yr@xmath2 .",
    "this is orders of magnitude faster than the accumulation of internal stresses due to ambipolar diffusion or hall drift ( goldreich & reisenegger 1992 ; thompson & duncan 1996 ) , and hence a quickly developing instability is involved in the crust yielding to the stresses .",
    "how this instability occurs is an open question .",
    "cracks are impossible because the crust has huge pressure ( jones 2003 ) .",
    "large slips are forbidden by the presence of strong magnetic fields , unless they are aligned within @xmath3  radian with magnetic flux surfaces ( levin & lyutikov 2012 ) .",
    "one plausible yielding mechanism is a plastic flow .",
    "this possibility is especially attractive for the inner crust , which may have an alloy - type lattice ( kobyakov & pethick 2014 ) .",
    "the internal stresses gradually accumulate over the lifetime of the star ( vigan et al .",
    "they cause elastic crustal deformations until the stress exceeds a critical value @xmath4 .",
    "a significant plastic motion can be initiated at this point .",
    "its development is assisted by heat generated by the plastic flow .",
    "we will show below that this leads to an instability launching a thermo - plastic wave ( tpw ) resembling a deflagration front .",
    "the propagating wave dissipates the magnetic energy inside the crust and creates the external magnetic twist .",
    "we will describe the mechanism of tpw using the simplest configuration where the crust is a slab with density @xmath5 threaded by uniform vertical magnetic field @xmath6 .",
    "the hydrostatic balance between two strong vertical forces ( gravity and pressure gradient ) constrains possible crustal displacements to the horizontal @xmath7-@xmath8 plane .",
    "the crust is almost incompressible , and therefore @xmath6 remains constant .",
    "the model is effectively one - dimensional : the horizontal components of magnetic field @xmath9 , @xmath10 and displacement @xmath11 , @xmath12 are functions of @xmath13 only .",
    "furthermore , for simplicity we take @xmath14 .",
    "an axisymmetric generalization will be briefly described in  5 .",
    "the plastic flow velocity is much smaller than the alfvn and shear speeds in the crust .",
    "therefore the elastic and magnetic forces are nearly balanced , ( -)=0 , where @xmath15 is the shear stress of the crustal lattice .",
    "this gives [ eq : balance ] b-= , where , b , and @xmath16 describes the magnetic field above the crust .",
    "below , we demonstrate the tpw mechanism with @xmath17 ; the effect of @xmath18 is considered in  5 .",
    "if the crust deformation was purely elastic , its strain @xmath19 would be given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the lattice shear modulus .",
    "when @xmath22 exceeds some critical value @xmath4 , a plastic shear flow is produced .",
    "this may occur either due to the activation of motion of microscopic lattice defects ( e.g. mason 1960 ) , or due to the nucleation of a multitude of magnetically - constrained micro - cracks ( levin & lyutikov 2012 ) .",
    "the total strain has two parts , [ eq : spl ] s = s_el+ , where @xmath23 is given by equation  ( [ elastic ] ) and @xmath24 is the plastic part of the strain .",
    "we will use the bingham - norton model of an elastic perfectly viscoplastic solid ( see e.g. irgens 2008 ) .",
    "it gives the plastic flow rate in the form , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is assumed , @xmath27 is the heaviside function , and @xmath28 is the effective dynamic viscosity .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath4 has been studied in detail for terrestrial alloys .",
    "two features are common : ( 1 ) strain hardening : @xmath4 may increase with @xmath29 due to the trapping of dislocations at the boundaries between the alloy grains . on the other hand",
    ", recrystallization can occur  the nucleation of new domains that introduce new dislocations .",
    "both effects are neglected below .",
    "( 2 ) thermal softening : @xmath4 decreases with temperature , due to the increased mobility of dislocations . in terrestrial alloys",
    ", this leads to the formation of shear bands  narrow bands with high @xmath30 . in a magnetically stressed neutron - star crust thermal softening leads to a tpw .",
    "we model the thermal softening in the linear approximation , [ eq : sigcr ] = _ 0-(-u_0 ) , where @xmath31 is the thermal energy density of a current state , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the thermal energy density and critical stress of some initial state , and @xmath34 is a positive constant . its value may be estimated as follows . at melting temperature @xmath35",
    "one expects the transition to fluid behavior , @xmath36 .",
    "the corresponding thermal energy density is @xmath37 .",
    "the ratio of coulomb lattice energy @xmath38 to its thermal energy at the melting point @xmath39 is @xmath40 .",
    "this gives an order - of - magnitude estimate for @xmath34 , [ eq : zeta ] ~ ~ ~s_0 .",
    "here @xmath41 is the maximum elastic strain of the cold crust at which it must yield , so @xmath42 . at low @xmath43 , in the absence of mobile dislocations",
    ", one would expect @xmath44 , comparable to the yielding threshold for an ideal crystal ( chugunov & horowitz 2010 ) .",
    "using @xmath45 ( e.g. chamel & haensel 2008 ) , one finds @xmath46 .",
    "( [ eq : sigcr ] ) can be replaced by more realistic models of thermal softening ( chugunov & horowitz 2010 ) . the true @xmath34 is a function of temperature @xmath47 ; it is sensitive to the behavior of heat capacity @xmath48 and depends on neutron superfluidity .",
    "in contrast to an elastic response , the plastic flow is an irreversible dissipative process .",
    "it is accompanied by the heating rate per unit volume @xmath49 .",
    "heating happens only where the plastic flow occurs , and this can lead to a strong temperature gradient @xmath50 and significant heat conduction .",
    "the thermal equation for the crustal material then reads [ eq : th1 ] = -+ , where @xmath51 the heat diffusion coefficient . here",
    "the simplest model assumes @xmath52 ; using the estimates of thermal conductivity @xmath53 and heat capacity @xmath54 ( e.g. gnedin et al .",
    "2001 ) , one finds the characteristic @xmath55  @xmath56  s@xmath2 in the deep crust .",
    "( [ eq : th1 ] ) neglects neutrino cooling ; it is assumed to be small compared with plastic heating and heat conduction on the timescales of interest .",
    "the crust is an excellent conductor , and we consider its dynamics on timescales much shorter than the timescale for ohmic dissipation . the field is therefore advected by horizontal displacement of the crust so that @xmath57 [ eq : sb ] b = s - s_0+b_0 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 at the onset of plastic flow .",
    "equations ( [ elastic])-([eq : sigcr ] ) , ( [ eq : th1 ] ) , and ( [ eq : sb ] ) specify the plastic flow dynamics .",
    "suppose @xmath10 is quickly dissipated above the crust , leaving no residual external stress .",
    "then @xmath17 and  ( [ eq : balance ] ) gives [ eq : balance1 ] = b. the density of `` free '' energy ( elastic + magnetic ) is given by + = + , and the stress balance  ( [ eq : balance1 ] ) implies [ eq : en_ratio ] = -=.    using  ( [ eq : balance1 ] ) , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , one obtains the following expression for the heat generated by the plastic flow : [ eq : heat ] dq =- d =- d .",
    "it expresses energy conservation : @xmath64 .",
    "for example , consider a magnetar with @xmath65  g , which corresponds to @xmath66  erg  @xmath67 . in the deep crust ,",
    "the shear modulus @xmath68  erg  @xmath67 exceeds @xmath69 . in this case , in a magneto - elastic equilibrium the stored elastic energy is negligible compared to the energy stored in @xmath10 : @xmath70 and @xmath71 ; hence @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "it is useful to first consider the plastic flow neglecting heat conduction ; this approximation will be relaxed in  4 .",
    "then the plastically generated heat remains stored locally in the crust , @xmath74 , and [ eq : uth ] -u_0= ( = 0 , ) .",
    "for definiteness , we assume @xmath75 ; then @xmath76 and @xmath77 .  (",
    "[ eq : plastic ] ) , ( [ eq : sigcr ] ) , and ( [ eq : uth ] ) give [ eq : sdot1 ] -= -_cr = b-_0 +",
    ". the plastic flow starts ( and stops ) at @xmath78 ; @xmath79 during the flow .",
    "the flow is initiated at @xmath80 and shears the crust so that @xmath60 is reduced .",
    "it is instructive to rewrite  ( [ eq : sdot1 ] ) in the following form , [ eq : sdot ] = ( b - b_0)(b - b_1 ) , where we used @xmath81 and b_0= , b_1=-b_0 .",
    "two conclusions can be drawn from  ( [ eq : sdot1 ] ) and ( [ eq : sdot ] ) :    \\(1 ) @xmath82 due to heating with decreasing @xmath60 , and a quick plastic relaxation of the magnetic stress is triggered at @xmath58 if @xmath83 .",
    "then a plastic deformation reducing @xmath60 results in @xmath79 , which continues to drive @xmath60 away from @xmath58 with an increasing rate ; this rate is controlled by viscosity @xmath28 : @xmath84 . the condition for this instability , @xmath85 , can be re - written as [ eq : inst ] > . in our simple model with the linear @xmath86 this condition becomes @xmath87 , which is equivalent to @xmath88 .",
    "if this condition is not satisfied , the stress relaxation through the thermoplastic instability does not occur ; instead there is a slow creep with @xmath78 .",
    "the magneto - elastic balance at the onset of instability gives @xmath89 (  [ eq : en_ratio ] ) .",
    "one can see that @xmath90 as long as @xmath91 , and hence the condition @xmath92 can be easily satisfied in the deep crust .",
    "\\(2 ) two final states are possible for the unstable plastic flow .",
    "if @xmath93 , the flow stops when @xmath60 is reduced to @xmath94 ; then it freezes with @xmath77 . the total energy density dissipated by the plastic flow",
    "is then given by q=(b_0",
    "^ 2-b_1 ^ 2 ) , ( b_1>0 ) . if @xmath95 , @xmath4 vanishes at some @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) . in this case , the crust melts during the plastic flow and becomes fluid , with negligible elastic stress ; the magnetic field will then relax to the stress - free state with @xmath98 .",
    "then all free energy is converted to heat , @xmath99 .",
    "the temperature achievable by converting magnetic energy to heat is @xmath100 . using the heat capacity @xmath101  erg  @xmath67  k@xmath2 ( its exact value depends on neutron superfluidity , gnedin et al .",
    "2001 ) , one finds @xmath102  k. it may exceed the melting temperature .    the characteristic timescale of the unstable flow may be estimated from  ( [ eq : sdot ] ) . besides time @xmath103 , it contains only two quantities of non - zero dimension , @xmath69 and @xmath28 .",
    "their ratio defines the timescale for the local energy release , [ eq : time ] t ~.",
    "a tpw is analogous to a deflagration front .",
    "both phenomena operate on two essential ingredients : ( 1 ) local heating / burning rate increases with temperature . for deflagration",
    "this is a chemical reaction while for tpw this is the temperature - sensitive plastic flow .",
    "( 2 ) heat conduction helps the burning to spread . in our case , the horizontal magnetic field plays the role of unburned fuel ; it is `` consumed '' by the induced plastic flow .",
    "consider a crust that is stressed by a slowly evolving magnetic field so that @xmath22 gradually approaches the critical value @xmath4 .",
    "it first reaches @xmath4 at some @xmath104 .",
    "the plastic flow initiated at @xmath104 generates heat , which is conducted to the neighborhood of @xmath104 where @xmath105 is initially smaller than @xmath106 .",
    "the spreading heat reduces @xmath4 and can lead to @xmath107 so that the region of plastic flow can spread upward and downward . when the characteristic thickness of the heated layer reaches @xmath108 estimated below , heat conduction is marginally able to cool it",
    ". then the thermoplastic instability launches a wave resembling the deflagration front in combustion physics .",
    "the propagation speed of the tpw is determined by the heat diffusion coefficient @xmath109 and viscosity @xmath28 .",
    "recall that @xmath28 sets the characteristic timescale of  burning \" the magnetic energy density @xmath110 (  [ eq : time ] ) while the characteristic width of the burning front @xmath108 is related to @xmath109 by l ~(t)^1/2 .",
    "the front velocity is [ eq : v ] v~~()^1/2 .",
    "the parameters of the crust ahead of the front vary with @xmath13 on the hydrostatic scale @xmath111 .",
    "the heating front with the characteristic thickness @xmath112 is a quasi - steady propagating structure where all parameters are functions of @xmath113 .",
    "the front structure is described by the plastic stress  ( [ eq : plastic ] ) and the thermal  ( [ eq : th1 ] ) . using @xmath114 and @xmath115 ,",
    "these equations give [ eq1 ] v=(b - b_0 ) + ( -u_0 ) , [ eq2 ] = -v , where we used  ( [ eq : heat ] ) for the generated plastic heat .",
    "we choose @xmath116 where the flow is initiated ; @xmath117 at this point .",
    "far ahead of the front the crust is cold ( @xmath118 ) and stable , @xmath119 .",
    "the ratio @xmath120 determines how much preheating ( through heat conduction ) occurs ahead of plastic flow zone .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) can be solved as follows .",
    "we divide them and obtain one equation for @xmath121 as a function of @xmath60 , [ eq ] = -p , p. this equation has a critical point where the numerator and denominator must vanish simultaneously . as long as @xmath122 , this point is reached at b_1=. we will assume @xmath93 .",
    "note that @xmath123 and @xmath124 as @xmath60 approaches @xmath94 , and hence @xmath94 represents the asymptotic downstream state of the crust behind the front .",
    "for any given parameter @xmath125  ( [ eq ] ) can be integrated from @xmath80 towards smaller @xmath60 , which gives a solution @xmath126",

    "we find the required @xmath125 and the corresponding solution @xmath126 numerically , using iterations .",
    "this determines the front velocity @xmath127 .",

    "a sample solution is shown in figure  3 .",

    "consider now an axisymmetric crustal plate in a cylindrical coordinate system @xmath130 .",
    "if gradients along @xmath13 are much greater than gradients along @xmath131 ( the depth of the crustal plate much smaller than its radius ) our plate is locally approximated by the slab model described in  2 - 4 with @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 .",
    "dissipation of toroidal field @xmath135 by the thermoplastic front propagating vertically inside the plate causes its rotation in the @xmath136 direction ( figure  2 ) .",
    "once the pair of upward and downward fronts are launched from the plastically heated region , the upper crust starts to rotate with respect to the static lower crust . each crustal layer crossed by the front",
    "is sheared by @xmath137 , and propagation of the two fronts in time @xmath138 rotates the upper crust by @xmath139 .",
    "this gives the rotation velocity of the plate , v_==-2(b_0-b_1 ) v , which twists the external magnetosphere attached to it .",
    "the magnetosphere is force - free , i.e. electric current @xmath140 associated with @xmath135 must flow along @xmath141 .",
    "the magnetospheric current penetrates the plate only where rotation is differential in the horizontal plane , @xmath142 ; in the region of rigid rotation the circuit closes horizontally along the plate surface ( beloborodov 2009 ) .",

    "heating is concentrated in the thin front , @xmath172  m , and neutrino emission cools the heated crust _ behind _ the front before it propagates a distance comparable to the crust thickness .    creating the external twist by the tpw is inevitably accompanied by dissipation at large depths where heat is drained by neutrino emission ( kaminker et al .",

    "the duration of these events is controlled by the speed of the tpw , which determines the shear rate of the crust .",
    "this rate can not be smaller than @xmath175  rad  s@xmath2 and is likely much higher .",
    "however , it is not high enough to explain the duration of magnetar bursts @xmath176  s. the bursts must be triggered in the magnetosphere , like solar flares , or by a faster failure mode of the crust that is yet to be identified .",
    "the burst duration is likely set by the mechanism of energy dissipation taking significantly longer than the alfvn crossing time of the magnetosphere .",
    "our description of a tpw delivering external twists works for a broad range of viscosity @xmath177  erg  s  @xmath67 .",
    "a weak lower bound @xmath178  erg  s  @xmath67 is provided by electron viscosity ( chugunov & yakovlev 2005 ) .",
    "a more relevant estimate may come from phonon viscosity , as the phonon gas exerts drag on the thermally activated dislocations ( mason 1960 ) .",
    "our future work will extend the tpw model to explicitly include the build up of magnetic stresses due to hall drift .",
