    "in game theory , coordination games are a class of games with multiple pareto - ranked equilibria in which players choose the same or corresponding strategies  @xcite . for those macroeconomists who believe that an economy may become mired in a low - output equilibrium , the coordination game is a particularly important paradigm  @xcite .",
    "it is also worth noting that coordination game has a potentially important application to evolutionary biology  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the coordination model helps to explain the puzzle why cooperative behavior can emerge when only the fittest survive : for example , punishment , an important mechanism that restricts selfish behavior , in fact transforms social dilemmas ( such as prisoner s dilemma game or public goods game ) into coordination games  @xcite .    in the minimum - effort coordination game ( mecg ) , which captures key features of the kinds of coordination problems faced by firms ,",
    "the common part of the payoff is determined by the minimum decision  @xcite .",
    "two players choose `` effort levels '' from an available strategy set and both have to perform a costly task to raise the joint production level .",
    "each player s payoff is the minimum of the two efforts minus the cost of its own effort .",
    "when a player with an effort level @xmath0 encounters an opponent with @xmath1 , the former gains the payoff @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a cost parameter .",
    "apparently , any common effort constitutes a nash equilibrium , and without further refinement the nash equilibrium concept provides little predictive power  @xcite .",
    "the lowest effort level corresponds to the least efficient or risk - dominant equilibrium and the highest effort level corresponds to the pareto - optimal or payoff - dominant equilibrium  @xcite . in the classic game theory ,",
    "the set of nash equilibria is obviously unaffected by changes in the effort cost or the number of players  @xcite .",
    "however , in the mecg experiments , the observed behaviors deviate from the results predicted by game theory  @xcite . in general , the cost parameter @xmath4 plays a decisive role in the effort level : behavior is concentrated close to the highest effort level when @xmath4 is low , whereas high values of @xmath4 lead to a dramatic declining of the mean contribution level . in some behavior experiments , although coordination can be improved by introducing other interaction mechanisms  @xcite , large cost continuously obstructs the stabilization of high level efforts .",
    "it is noteworthy that standard deterministic evolutionary game theory  @xcite , as well as classic game theory , can not present explanations for this paradoxical results either , since any common effort level is a strict nash equilibrium and hence a stable equilibrium point for the replicator equations  @xcite . to explain the behavior found empirically in the mecg , a variety of theoretical approaches have been proposed .",
    "stochastic learning models were investigated to explain the anomalous behavior observed in the mecg  @xcite .",
    "anderson  @xcite extended rosenthal s analysis  @xcite to a mecg with a continuum of actions and used the logit probabilistic choice framework to determine a unique `` logit equilibrium '' .",
    "recently , iyer and killingback studied the evolutionary dynamics of these games through individual - based simulations on complex networks , showing that the evolutionary behaviors are in good agreement with those observed experimentally  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we study the mecg with mixed strategies  @xcite from the perspective of the evolutionary balance between selection and mutation .",
    "drawing lessons from coalescence theory  @xcite , we can well resolve the problem which effort levels are more abundant than others under any mutation rates . in the well - mixed situation ,",
    "analytic results show that high effort levels can be favored when the effort cost is small , and the opposite is true when the cost is large , which is in accordance with behavior experiments and does not require extra notion of cognition or rationality .",
    "more importantly , human society is organized in forms of various sets  @xcite , and the outcome of an evolutionary process in a structured populations ( such as games on variety of networks  @xcite , sets  @xcite or phenotype space  @xcite ) can be very different from that in well - mixed populations .",
    "therefore we utilize evolutionary set theory to investigate the extended model that individuals only interact with others who are in the same set .",
    "it seems that more sets always enhance effort levels with all other conditions equal .",
    "this is ascribed to the fact that group structure supports the evolution of `` within - group helping ''  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , moderate extent of random migration between sets effectively boosts mean contribution level  @xcite .",

    "within this work , the basic model is a minimum - effort coordination game ( mecg ) .",
    "here we consider the two - person game with a strategy set @xmath5 . without loss of generality , we set @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "we specify an individual @xmath7 s strategy as @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 be the payoff that strategy @xmath0 gets from strategy @xmath1 , @xmath10 .",
    "more specifically , @xmath9 is given by the function : @xmath11 where @xmath4 is the cost parameter .",
    "at first we consider the simple but general situation of well - mixed population without any structure . in the population that consist of @xmath12 individuals",
    ", each one plays the mecg with every other one and they all get payoffs according to the function above .",
    "we express the fitness of player @xmath7 as an exponential function of the total payoff , i.e. , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the intensity of selection and @xmath15 is @xmath7 s total payoff accrued through pairwise interactions with all others once . in this frequency - dependent moran process",
    "@xcite , at each time step an individual @xmath7 is selected for reproduction proportional to its @xmath16 .",
    "reproduction is subject to mutation : the offspring inherits the strategy of the parent with probability @xmath17 and with probability @xmath18 it adopts a strategy selected uniformly at random .",
    "a strategy @xmath19 is favored overall in the mutation - selection equilibrium if its abundance exceeds the mean .    in well - mixed population , we only concentrate on the situation that strategies are continuous .",

    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , we find the condition for strategy @xmath19 in mecg to be favored by selection to be @xmath29 p+ ( \\frac{\\kappa}{2}-\\frac{1}{3 } ) nu+(\\kappa-\\frac{1}{2})>0.\\ ] ] we can obtain the most common strategy @xmath19 by maximizing @xmath28 in inequality ( 4 ) .      in this extended model , a population of finite size @xmath12",
    "is distributed over @xmath30 sets and each individual belongs to one set .",
    "the sets could be geographical islands but they could also be phenotypic traits or tags  @xcite .",
    "two individuals interact only if they are in the same set ( have the same tag ) .",
    "successful sets attract more individuals .",
    "in addition , in the mutation - selection analysis , besides strategy mutation @xmath18 , a set mutation rate @xmath31 is introduced to represent individuals random migration between sets .",
    "the update rule is similar to that in well - mixed population .",
    "it is useful to consider the rescaled mutation rates , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , in the theoretical analysis .",
    "when available strategies in the evolutionary process are discrete and the total number is @xmath34 , for simplicity , we utilize the @xmath35 payoff matrix @xmath36 $ ] ( @xmath37 ) to describe payoffs between any two discrete strategies .",

    "each individual s strategy is initialized randomly at the beginning of the simulation , and the strategies of all individuals are recorded over @xmath50 generations .",
    "in the weak selection limit where all individuals have roughly the same reproductive success , it is possible to analytically derive which strategy is most frequent . in the well - mixed populations without any structure , by maximizing @xmath28 in condition ( 4 ) , we find that the most common strategy @xmath51 follows : @xmath52 as is shown in fig .",
    "1 , the effort cost @xmath4 plays the decisive role in determining @xmath51 : for small @xmath4 ( @xmath53 ) , natural selection most favors individuals who are willing to contribute a higher level ( @xmath54 ) ; whereas large @xmath4 ( @xmath55 ) leads to the prevalence of low @xmath51 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "@xmath51 monotonically increases with the decreasing of effort cost , according with economic intuition and patterns in laboratory data  @xcite . for low mutation rates , at most two strategies are involved in the population .",
    "when @xmath53 the fully contribution strategy @xmath57 behaves better than any another strategy , thereby remaining the most abundant ; when @xmath55 , the risk - dominant strategy @xmath58 prevails .",
    "conversely , for high mutation rates , all strategies have almost equal frequencies throughout evolution , and the strategy contributing @xmath59 occupy a position of prominence in this strategy - coexistence state .",
    "intrudingly , despite the strategy mutation rates , @xmath51 sustains at the level of 0.5 for the critical cost value @xmath60 , resembling a `` neutral state '' .",
    "we next evaluate the impact of selection intensity @xmath14 on the strategy distributions in the low mutation case .",
    "sufficiently small @xmath18 assures that a single mutant vanishes or fixes in a population before the next mutant appears , therefore the population is homogeneous most of the time  @xcite .",
    "thus besides individual - based simulations , embedded markov chain  @xcite can be utilized here to describe the evolutionary dynamics .",
    "simulation results , in good agreement with the analytical results , show that strengthening @xmath14 does not alter the most common strategy @xmath51 , but enhances the advantage of @xmath51 . when @xmath55 the average contribution level of the whole population decreases with the increment of @xmath14 ( see fig.2 ( a ) , ( b ) ) , and the opposite is true for @xmath53 ( see fig.2 ( c ) , ( d ) ) .",
    "if the imitation strength is considered to be a measure of how precise people s information is in learning  @xcite , it seems that information transparency drives the majority of individuals to make a choice between the `` worst '' nash outcome @xmath61 and the `` best '' equilibrium @xmath62 , critically , relying on whether the effort cost is large .",
    "drawing support from individual - based simulations , we have further studied how the average effort evolves across a wide range of selection strengths and mutation rates .",
    "some view points above have been strengthened in this more general case . as shown in fig .",
    "3 , for small @xmath14 , all the average strategies are close to 0.5 , their neutral values . as @xmath14 increases , the average efforts are determined primarily by cost parameter @xmath4 . @xmath53",
    "leads to the fact that the mean contributions are always more than a half and ascends as @xmath14 rises . on the contrary ,",
    "@xmath55 causes a detrimental effect to whole populations efforts with increasing @xmath14 .",
    "strategy mutation , introducing randomness into selection , always inhibits the mean strategy from converging to the extreme states `` fully cooperation''(@xmath57 ) or `` complete defection '' ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "furthermore , we are interested in how individuals behave in the mecg if they are located in different groups and they do not play with out - group members . here , successful sets attract members , and individuals may adopts a random set with probability @xmath31 , called migration rate , similar to strategy mutation @xmath18 . this extended model can be investigated using evolutionary set theory  @xcite .",
    "initially , we concentrate on the simple case of only two strategies @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where @xmath63 . in well - mixed populations , irrespective of any choosing intensity @xmath14 or mutation rate @xmath18",
    ", @xmath55 determines that @xmath0 always performs worse than @xmath1 .",
    "however , `` in - group favoritism '' may greatly facilitate @xmath0 , if @xmath64 which can be obtained by substituting eq .",
    "( 1 ) into condition ( 5 ) when the total number @xmath34 of available strategies is @xmath65 ( correspondingly the size of matrix @xmath66 is @xmath67 ) . for small strategy mutation ( @xmath68 )",
    ", @xmath69 can be further simplified as @xmath70 as shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) , for large effort cost @xmath71 and high migration rate @xmath72 , condition @xmath73 leads to @xmath74 showing the minimum requirement for @xmath30 to ensure that @xmath0 prevails over @xmath1 .",
    "as @xmath75 increases , more sets are required for sustaining @xmath0 at a higher level than @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "4 ( b)-(d ) ) . in this sense , for large cost parameter",
    "@xmath4 either elevating @xmath75 or @xmath76 ( when @xmath76 is large ) undermine the evolution of contribution level , but increasing @xmath30 always boosts effort . this can be attributed to the fact that more sets enhance the opportunity of the clustering of higher level strategy ( @xmath0 ) to resist against the invasion from the lower level strategy ( @xmath1 ) , even under unfavorable conditions ( @xmath55 ) .    moreover , in the weak selection limit , we investigated the mecg with continuous strategy set @xmath6 $ ] . a global mutation model , in which an offspring mutant adopts a strategy randomly and uniformly drawn from the unit interval @xmath5 , is utilized to arrive at the analytical results .",
    "using inequality ( 9 ) , we deduce that natural selection favors strategy @xmath19 if and only if @xmath77p \\cr    & -&\\frac{1-\\kappa}{2}\\lambda_1 + \\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\lambda_2+(\\frac{\\kappa}{2}-\\frac{1}{3})\\lambda_3>0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similarly , the most abundant strategy @xmath51 can be obtained by maximizing @xmath78 .",
    "interestingly , for small strategy mutation @xmath79 , the fully contribution behavior ( @xmath62 ) is most favored if @xmath73 ( inequality ( 12 ) ) holds ; otherwise the majority choose to invest nothing ( @xmath61 ) . the optimum level @xmath51 is presented in fig . 5 across a wide range of @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath30",
    "obviously , @xmath4 also plays the key role in determining @xmath51 ( compare fig .",
    "5(a)-(c ) with ( d)-(f ) ) .",
    "the evolution of @xmath51 is prominently promoted by increasing @xmath30 , especially for large @xmath4 , as shown in fig .",
    "5(a)-(c ) .",
    "however , low values of set mutation rate @xmath76 , which can be treated as failure in distinguishing sets , keeps individuals from adopting high effort levels ( note the lower parts of fig .",
    "5(a)-(c ) ) . in addition , moderate @xmath76 , equipped with small @xmath75 , is capable of maximizing @xmath51 even when @xmath55 ( see the left parts of fig .",
    "5(b)(c ) ) .",
    "we are also interested in whether the average strategy frequency @xmath80 of the whole population can exceed the neutral level for large @xmath4 . drawing supports from ref .",
    "@xcite , we can conclude that the condition which ensures @xmath81 is @xmath82 which also leads to @xmath69 ( inequality ( 11 ) ) , coinciding with the two strategies case .",
    "the feasible regions of combinations of @xmath30 and @xmath76 , where the whole population incline to contribute a higher level on average , are also presented in fig .",
    "4 .    last , under moderate selection intensity , by computer simulations we show the impacts of @xmath30 and migration rate @xmath76 on average effort respectively .",
    "low @xmath4 facilitates effort , in accordance with above analysis . for @xmath55",
    ", the average effort ascends sharply with @xmath30 when @xmath83 , then stabilizes at a level slightly above @xmath84 . as shown in fig .",
    "6(b ) , there is an optimal level of @xmath76 promoting the effort level . as mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , without flexibility in group identity ( @xmath85 ) individuals reside in the same sets forever . on the other hand ,",
    "excessively high values of @xmath76 make the association between strategy and group membership breaks down .",
    "in the minimum - effort coordination game , any common effort constitutes a nash equilibrium . without further refinement ,",
    "the nash equilibrium concept provides little predictive power .",
    "however , experimental data show that efforts are much lower when effort is more costly , or when there are more players  @xcite .",
    "to explain the inconsistency , we bring together ideas from coalescence theory and evolutionary game dynamics , to investigate how effort levels evolve in a mutation - selection process .    in the well - mixed situation ,",
    "analytical results show that effort cost is the primary factor in determining contribution levels , which is in accordance with experimental data .",
    "meanwhile , changing imitation intensity can not alter the most common strategy here , different from the case in the tdg  @xcite .",
    "when selection is weak , the dynamics depends greatly on the strategy mutation rate @xmath18 .",
    "the most common strategy adopted by players converges from the highest contribution level ( when @xmath53 ) or the lowest contribution level ( when @xmath55 ) to @xmath86 as @xmath18 increases .",
    "furthermore , populations are structured by geography or other factors  @xcite .",
    "individuals usually can only interact with those in the same set or group .",
    "therefore evolutionary set theory is utilized to study evolutionary dynamics of mecg in structured populations .",
    "it seems that more sets and moderate migration rate can effectively promote effort levels , especially when the costs are large .",
    "since higher effort levels in mecg may be considered to represent more cooperative strategies  @xcite , our finding strengthens the viewpoint that the structure of the population allows `` cooperative '' strategies to `` cluster '' in certain sets to resist the invasion of the `` defective '' ones .",
    "this also helps to explain why optimal coordination level is sometimes achieved even if the cost is very large in human society .",
    "the mecg is of considerable practical importance since many interesting and significant real - world situations can be modeled by such games  @xcite .",
    "we hope our observations could help to explain how coordination behaviors evolve in a variety of real life situations .                                                                                                          ) in the weak selection limit .",
