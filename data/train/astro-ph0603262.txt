    "circumstellar discs play an important role in the formation and early evolution of low - mass stars .",
    "there is ample empirical evidence that the majority of stars are born with circumstellar discs @xcite .",
    "it has also become clear that dust discs are removed relatively quickly , likely within 10myr @xcite . as the building blocks for planetary systems , it is imperative that we understand disc processes . in particular",
    "the timescale for disc dissipation is crucial in determining whether planets form and on what timescales @xcite and might control exoplanet growth and migration @xcite .",
    "it is also not well understood how the star formation environment might condition disc evolution and consequently planet formation .",
    "recently , a huge observational effort has been channelled into determining the disc frequency in star forming regions , in order to empirically constrain the disc destruction timescale .",
    "circumstellar dust discs are cooler than the stellar photospheres , therefore they irradiate mainly at infrared ( ir ) wavelengths . in particular , a @xmath6 colour excess is a robust disc indicator @xcite , at least for the first few myr ; for older associations the inner disc becomes optically thin and dust excesses are only detected at longer wavelengths @xcite .",
    "using @xmath6 excess as a disc indicator , @xcite determine that within the first 3myr approximately half of the dust discs disappear and that at 6myr most low - mass stars have lost their discs .",
    "this timescale relies on few clusters with rather uncertain ages ; observations of more clusters in the crucial 3@xmath15myr age range are essential .",
    "the @xmath2orionis association was first identified in _",
    "rosat _ images as a concentration of bright x - ray sources around the massive multiple system @xcite .",
    "photometric surveys @xcite identified a score of pre - main - sequence ( pms ) candidates well into the brown dwarf regime and @xcite discovered several objects with masses below the deuterium burning limit ( for ongoing surveys on very - low - mass cluster candidates see * ? ? ?",
    "optical spectroscopy has been used to confirm membership for many cluster candidates @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigate variability and rotation in very low - mass cluster members while @xcite analysed the xmm-_newton _ x - ray properties of pms stars within the central 30arcmin area .",
    "the age of the cluster is 3@xmath15myr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for an hipparcos distance ( to the central star ) of 352pc .",
    "the reddening towards the cluster namesake is low , @xmath7 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have been investigating the ir properties of the @xmath2ori cluster members . @xcite and @xcite use mid - ir imaging and spectroscopy to confirm several objects as classical ttauri stars ( ctts ) and therefore likely members of the @xmath2ori cluster .",
    "@xcite use @xmath3 excesses for a sample of 24 cluster members to constrain the cluster disc frequency ; they found that @xmath8% of cluster members retain their discs .",
    "we have since expanded that thermal - ir survey ; we here present new imaging observations of an additional 59 cluster members in the k- and l@xmath0-bands .",
    "we compute the disc frequency for the complete sample of 83 cluster members and investigate the mass dependence of disc dissipation across a wider mass range .",
    "targets were selected from several samples from the literature .",
    "objects from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have been confirmed as cluster members using a combination of spectroscopic indicators : the presence of the lii 6708  line , a weak nai ir doublet and radial velocity measurements .",
    "we did not choose members identified on the basis of strong h@xmath9  emission in order not to bias the sample towards objects with accretion discs . to complement the sample at the higher mass end we selected high photometric probability ( @xmath1070% ) members from the optical and near - ir sample of @xcite .",
    "there are also 2 targets from the photometric sample of @xcite .",
    "fig.[cmd ] shows the @xmath11 colour - magnitude diagram of the observed sample as well as the sample from @xcite , together with isochrones and evolutionary tracks from @xcite , adopting the hipparcos distance of 352pc .",
    "@xcite investigated whether differential reddening should be taken into account ; they found that the only objects to exhibit significant reddening also display an ir excess .",
    "we could use the reddening determination towards @xmath2ori itself , but it is rather small ( @xmath7 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in particular at ir wavelengths ; therefore we follow @xcite and do not de - redden targets magnitudes and colours .",
    "the masses of the cluster members are then in the range 0.04@xmath11.0m@xmath4 , with 6 objects below the brown dwarf boundary .",
    "the median age of the sample is 4.2myr , consistent with previous determinations , e.g. , 4.2@xmath12myr from @xcite .",
    "if a larger distance of 440pc is adopted , the isochronal age of the cluster decreases to 2.5myr @xcite  and the computed pms masses are only slightly increased . in any of these studies",
    "the presence of hitherto unidentified binaries can cause the age determination to be biased towards younger ages .",
    "a small average reddening would also cause the cluster to appear younger , but in the case of the @xmath2ori cluster this effect is negligible . from the absence of lithium depletion in the cluster members ,",
    "@xcite estimate an upper limit to the cluster age of 8myr .",

    "k@xmath13-band magnitudes from 2mass ( two micron all sky survey , @xcite ) were used to set the exposure times in this band , while evolutionary models from @xcite provided estimates of the l - band photospheric magnitudes of the targets , in the absence of circumstellar emission .",

    "we use tabulated relations between colours and spectral type from @xcite , converted to the appropriate photometric system .",
    "we estimate the spectral type that corresponds respectively to the observed @xmath17 and @xmath18 colours  for objects with no obvious @xmath18 excess , sect.[acc ] .",
    "these two quantities are then averaged to compute the values listed in table[excess_table ] ( indicated by @xmath19 ) .",
    "these spectral type determinations are uncertain by about a subclass ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a full discussion ) ; spectral types measured from optical spectroscopy typically have quoted uncertainties of half a subclass . accordingly , the excess error listed in the table combines in quadrature the photometric errors with this spectral type error .",
    "fig.[spt ] shows the spectral types ( both estimated and known from the literature ) for the sample , plotted against i - band magnitude .",
    "a similar diagram ( effectively a colour - magnitude diagram ) can be found in @xcite .",
    "for each spectral type , the `` scatter '' in magnitude is similar between objects with published and estimated spectral types , suggesting reliable spectral type determinations .",
    "both @xmath17 and @xmath18 colours can be affected by the disc itself and interstellar reddening .",
    "however , we find good agreement between spectral types computed by this colour method and derived directly from spectroscopy .",
    "furthermore , a mere glance at the @xmath20 diagram in fig.[ccd ] shows that the disc frequency determined in this way is not very sensitive to spectral type ( e.g. , @xmath17 ) uncertainties ( see next paragraph ) .",
    "therefore we are confident these spectral type determinations are appropriate , _ as an aide for the disc frequency determination and as long as spectral type uncertainties are taken into account_.            of the 83 cluster members in the sample ( iras sources excluded ) , 27 objects have 2-@xmath2 significant @xmath3 excesses , indicating a disc frequency of ( 33@xmath56)% . this value is consistent , at the 1-@xmath2 level , with ( 46@xmath514)% computed by @xcite for a subset of 24 objects ( but see sect.[mass ] ) .",
    "these figures are conservative , as we demand a 2-@xmath2 significant detection as a disc indicator .",
    "furthermore , for fainter targets increasing l@xmath0-band uncertainties mean that we might be unable to detect a small excess .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath20 diagram in fig.[ccd ] confirms that all 2-@xmath2 detections are reliable and it also suggests that more objects might have a @xmath3 excess , just not statistically significant . thus this disc frequency should be taken as a lower limit .",
    "most of our sample has supporting spectroscopic evidence of cluster membership ( i.e. their spectra show spectroscopic indicators of youth and their radial velocities are consistent with cluster membership , see sect.[target_sample ] ) but 19 objects are selected only on the basis of their photometry . because contaminating field stars would be unlikely to have circumstellar emission it is important to assess the level of this contamination and determine its effect on our derived disc frequencies .",
    "as young stars are ( on average ) much more x - ray luminous than any older contaminating field objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we can use x - ray luminosities as another membership indicator .",
    "@xcite have recently analysed xmm-_newton _ observations of an epic field centered on the o - star @xmath2ori ( area of diameter @xmath1430arcmin ) . from our sample ,",
    "51 targets lie within the epic field of view .",
    "cross - correlating these targets with the x - ray data we find 30 objects with x - ray detections and 3-@xmath2 upper limits for the rest .",
    "the x - ray luminosities are presented as a function of @xmath21 colour in fig.[lx ] .",
    "of the 19 photometric candidates , 8 are in the epic field and 5 are detected with x - ray luminosities greater than @xmath22ergs@xmath23 .",
    "it is highly unlikely that contaminating field m - dwarfs would have x - ray luminosities as high as this ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein for an analysis of x - ray luminosity evolution with time ) , and so these 5 young m stars are highly probable cluster members .",
    "the 3 non - detections are at colours of @xmath24 where the lack of an x - ray detection does not adequately discriminate between very young stars and field m - dwarfs because the x - ray survey is not sensitive enough .",
    "indeed , many spectroscopically confirmed members are not detected in x - rays at these colours ( fig.[lx ] ) . according to @xcite ,",
    "almost all objects in photometrically selected cluster samples with @xmath25 are revealed as genuine cluster members when spectroscopic indicators are used , so we have little doubt that the contamination among these cool photometrically selected candidates is very small .",
    "even if we were reasonably conservative and use the published photometric membership probabilities of @xcite  i.e. ignoring the x - ray evidence  we estimate that 17% of the 19 photometric candidates might be contaminants .",
    "even if these @xmath26 objects are assumed not to have discs and are removed from the sample it can not raise the deduced disc frequency significantly . alternatively , we can simply ignore the 11 photometric cluster candidates that lie outside the epic field of view and therefore have no supporting x - ray evidence for their membership .",
    "the resulting disc frequency is still 32% , consistent with our estimates in the previous section .",
    "we have also confirmed that such a procedure would not affect our conclusions regarding any mass dependence of the disc frequency ( see next section ) .",
    "the disc frequency for objects in the epic field is ( 33@xmath58)% while the disc frequency for objects outside this central area is ( 31@xmath59)% . these estimates are indistinguishable from the total disc frequency of ( 33@xmath56)% , thus we find no evidence for any spatial segregation of objects with and without circumstellar discs .",
    "one of the main goals behind the @xmath2ori cluster survey was to investigate the possibility of a mass dependence in the disc frequency . using the colour - magnitude diagram and isochrones from fig.[cmd ] ,",
    "we have determined the masses and ages of the cluster members .",
    "we have divided the sample in 3 mass bins and determined the disc frequency in each bin .",
    "the mass bins are m@xmath270.5m@xmath4 , 0.5m@xmath4@xmath10m@xmath270.1m@xmath4 and 0.1m@xmath4@xmath10m@xmath270.04m@xmath4 ; the respective disc frequencies are 11/26 or ( 42@xmath513)% , 13/45 or ( 28@xmath58)% and 3/12 or ( 25@xmath514)% .",
    "thus , there is a hint of a decrease in disc frequency towards lower masses that could also explain the slightly higher disc frequency determined by @xcite .",
    "however this result is not conclusive and these disc frequencies are entirely consistent with no mass dependence . in particular in the lower mass bin , objects have redder intrinsic colours and with increasing uncertainties in the l@xmath0-band photometry , the measurements are less capable of identifying excesses .",
    "it is still not clear whether disc frequencies or disc dissipation time scales are mass dependent .",
    "@xcite find high disc frequencies from f to late m spectral types for the 1myr - old trapezium cluster , suggesting that the probability of disc formation around a star is both high and essentially mass independent .",
    "however , in their more recent work , @xcite find a hint that the disc frequency around brown dwarfs in the trapezium cluster might be lower than around stellar objects , but completeness issues make this result inconclusive . for ic348 ( 2@xmath13myr )",
    "@xcite suggest a disc frequency decrease from spectral types g down to m. recently , @xcite analysed spitzer near- and mid - ir photometry of ic348 and they find that the disc frequency peaks for late - k to early - m spectral types , suggesting that disc dissipation is mass dependent .",
    "the disc frequencies we have determined for the different mass bins are consistent with the ic348 result but are also statistically consistent with a single disc frequency for the @xmath2orionis cluster across the mass range . to settle this question in a conclusive way",
    ", it would be necessary to gather a larger sample of very low - mass cluster members with better signal - to - noise ratio measurements in the l - band .",
    "strong h@xmath9 emission and broad line profiles were the classical indicator of young stars with discs , but we now know that they only identify actively accreting discs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our sample",
    ", 33 objects have h@xmath9 equivalent width measurements ( ew[h@xmath9 ] ) or have been identified as accretors based on the width of the h@xmath9 profile @xcite ( table[excess_table ] and fig.[halpha ] ) . using the @xcite criterion of ew[h@xmath9 ] as a function of spectral type , we can identify stars with a h@xmath9 `` excess emission '' , i.e. objects that exhibit emission strong enough to indicate active accretion onto the star  the @xcite criterion could also be used , yielding the same results . out of these 33 cluster members ,",
    "10 stars have accretion discs ; a fraction of @xmath29% consistent with previous results ( 30@xmath140% , @xcite and @xmath30% , @xcite ) . of the 10 objects with an accretion disc , 8 objects have 2-@xmath2 significant @xmath3 disc detections , while 2 fainter objects have @xmath3 excesses at a significance level @xmath101.5-@xmath2 ( marginal disc detections ) .",
    "thus , probably all h@xmath9-identified accretors have circumstellar discs indicated by a @xmath3 excess .",
    "however , 6 objects show a @xmath3 excess but no h@xmath9 excess emission , i.e.  as expected not all objects with discs are actively accreting .    of the total sample of 87 objects , 11 stars or about",

    "the comparison of these indicators reinforces the `` hierarchy '' of disc identifiers . in a sample of young objects with measurements of all three disc indicators : a @xmath3 excess identifies most ( if not all ) circumstellar discs , h@xmath9 excess emission identifies those discs actively accreting , while @xmath33 excesses identify discs with higher accretion rates , with factors like system geometry and stellar parameters also playing a role @xcite .",

    "is uncertain ( values between 2.5myr and 8myr can be found in the literature ) we are unable to derive firmer conclusions on the disc dissipation timescale , but an older age for the @xmath2ori cluster would imply a slower rate of disc dispersal .",
    "we find no evidence of spatial segregation of objects with or without circumstellar discs .",
    "we have investigated a possible mass dependence of the disc frequency .",
    "we find that for stars more massive than 0.5m@xmath4 the disc frequency is ( 42@xmath513)% , decreasing to ( 28@xmath58)% and ( 25@xmath514)% respectively for stars with masses in the range 0.5m@xmath4@xmath10m@xmath270.1m@xmath4 and 0.1m@xmath4@xmath10m@xmath270.04m@xmath4 .",
