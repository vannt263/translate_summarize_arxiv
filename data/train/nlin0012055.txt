    "the two - centre coulomb problem , that is , the problem of solving the schrdinger equation for the motion of an electron with the charge @xmath8 @xmath9 in the field of two fixed coulomb centres with charges @xmath10 and @xmath11 at the distance @xmath12 from each other , plays an important role in several fields of theoretical physics , for example in the theory of diatomic molecules , in scattering theory , and in the three - body problem .",
    "the two - centre coulomb problem has therefore been the subject of extensive studies both by numerical and by approximate analytical methods , and hence the literature on this problem is very comprehensive . in spite of this fact it is still of interest to continue the treatment of this problem for arbitrary values of @xmath13 and @xmath12 .",
    "one reason for this is that the numerically exact solution of the problem meets with difficulties when @xmath14 increases .",
    "there appear also numerical difficulties for large values of @xmath12 . for a general review of the problem",
    "we refer to eyring _",
    "@xcite , herzberg @xcite , slater @xcite and rosen @xcite .    ignoring the finiteness of the mass of the protons , bates _",
    "et al._@xcite obtained important numerical results for the hydrogen molecule ion .",
    "corresponding numerical results were obtained by wallis and hulburt @xcite for the homonuclear one - electron two - centre problem , by bates and carson @xcite for the ion @xmath15 , by wind @xcite for the ground state of the hydrogen molecule ion , by peek @xcite for the states @xmath16 and @xmath17 of the hydrogen molecule ion , and by ponomarev and puzynina @xcite for several states of the coulomb two - centre system with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "hunter and pritchard@xcite used a numerical procedure to compute nonadiabatic energies for the first few rotation - vibration levels of @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 . for the hydrogen molecule ion rosenthal and e. bright wilson , jr . , @xcite calculated an accurate value of the ground state energy which is in agreement with the values obtained by wind @xcite and peek@xcite .",
    "for different internuclear distances bates and reid @xcite , murai @xcite and murai and takatsu @xcite calculated electronic energies for various states of the hydrogen molecule ion under the assumption of infinite proton mass . for a large range of internuclear distances winter _",
    "et al._@xcite made very accurate calculations for the lowest 20 states of the molecule ion @xmath23 .",
    "klaus@xcite studied the electronic energy of the ground state of the hydrogen molecule ion for small internuclear separation @xmath12 and confirmed the remarkable discovery by byers brown and steiner @xcite that the electronic energy can not be expanded in powers of @xmath12 alone , but that powers of ln@xmath12 must also be included .",
    "klaus @xcite also obtained for the hydrogen molecule ion further terms in the series given by byers brown and steiner @xcite for the general two - centre coulomb problem .",
    "there exist also various approximate analytical methods for solving the quantal two - centre coulomb problem . in one of them",
    "one uses the quasiclassical approximation , that is , the first order of the phase - integral approximation . in using this method ,",
    "one encountered in the early papers difficulties associated with the divergence of the phase - integral due to an inappropriate choice of the phase - integrand ( also called the quasimomentum ) , which is not determined quite uniquely .",
    "different authors have mastered these difficulties in different ways , but no single unifying method has until now been proposed for the two - centre coulomb problem .",
    "an essential feature in our method is the use of the phase - integral approximation generated from an unspecified base function ; see the appendix .",
    "the semiclassical quantization of the low - lying electronic states of the hydrogen molecule ion was treated by strand and reinhardt @xcite .",
    "pajunen @xcite calculated the energy levels of the hydrogen molecule ion ( under the assumption of infinitely heavy nuclei ) in the first and the third order of the phase - integral approximation .",
    "although he refers to one of the papers ( his reference 10 ) in which the phase - integral approximation generated from an unspecified base function was introduced , he does not use the freedom to choose optimal expressions for the functions that he denotes by @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and that in the present paper correspond to the more general base functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively . in the present paper",
    "we shall make full use of the possibility to choose @xmath26 and @xmath27 most conveniently .    the phase - integral method , in which one uses the phase - integral approximation generated from an unspecified base function @xcite , offers a method for mastering the previously mentioned difficulties in a unified way for an arbitrary order of the phase - integral approximation . in the present paper we shall apply this method to the quantal two - centre coulomb problem with fixed coulomb centres .    for the convenience of the reader a short review of the phase - integral method and formulas to be used",
    "are given in the appendix .",
    "the present paper will be the basis for further work , in which convenient transformations to complete elliptic integrals will be used , analogously as in papers by lakshmanan and kaliappan@xcite and lakshmanan _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "thereby the contour integrals , occurring in the quantization conditions , will be expressed in terms of complete elliptic integrals .",
    "we start by quoting some well - known results . the time - independent schrdinger equation for the motion of an electron of mass @xmath28 and charge @xmath8 @xmath9 in the field of two fixed coulomb centres with charges @xmath10 and @xmath11 takes the following form    @xmath29    where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the distances of the electron from the two centres , @xmath32 is the position vector of the electron , and e is the electronic energy . to obtain",
    "the total energy one must add the potential energy of the two fixed charges , getting @xmath33 where @xmath12 is the distance between the two centres .",
    "the differential equation ( [ e1 ] ) is separable in elliptic coordinates . if one introduces the variables    @xmath34    @xmath35    and puts @xmath36 where @xmath2 is the magnetic quantum number ( positive or negative integer or zero ) , and @xmath37 is the corresponding angle , the separation yields , in atomic units @xmath38 , the two differential equations    [ e2 ] @xmath39 @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the separation constant and    @xmath42",
    "@xmath43    @xmath44    putting    @xmath45    @xmath46    we can transform the differential equations ( [ e2 ] ) into    [ e3 ] @xmath47 @xmath48    where    [ e4 ] @xmath49 @xmath50    with @xmath51 the differential equations ( [ e3 ] ) are of the schrdinger type . by solving them simultaneously under the boundary conditions that @xmath52 and @xmath53 , one can obtain the energy and the separation constant as functions of the distance @xmath12 and the quantum numbers .",
    "when @xmath54 every bound - state wave function @xmath55 is either an even or an odd function of @xmath56 , and when @xmath32 is reflected at the centre of symmetry for the two - centre coulomb problem , the wave function ( [ wf ] ) remains unchanged when @xmath55 and @xmath2 are both even or both odd , while the wave function ( [ wf ] ) changes sign when one of @xmath55 and @xmath2 is even and the other is odd .",
    "the essential features of the phase - integral method are briefly sketched in the appendix .",
    "the phase - integral solutions of the differential equations ( 2.8a ) and ( 2.8b ) , respectively , are linear combinations of the phase - integral functions    @xmath57    and @xmath58    respectively , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively , are generated according to ( a5a , b ) , ( a6a , b , c ) , ( a3 ) and ( a2 ) in the appendix , with @xmath61 replaced by the appropriate functions @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively , the quantities pertaining to the @xmath64-equation being characterized by a tilde .      as is seen from ( 2.9a , b ) , the functions @xmath65 and @xmath66 have poles at @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively ; these poles are of the second order if @xmath69 , but of the first order if @xmath70 .",
    "furthermore , we note that when @xmath71 the coefficients of the second - order poles differ from @xmath72 , while for @xmath73 they are equal to @xmath72 .",
    "there are two main alternatives , discussed in the appendix for the case of the radial schrdinger equation , for choosing the base functions generating the phase - integral functions ( 3.1a ) and ( 3.1b ) .",
    "unifying these two alternatives , we choose the squares of the base functions to be    @xmath74    @xmath75    where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are parameters , the choice of which we shall discuss below .",
    "the introduction of these parameters increases essentially the flexibility of the phase - integral formulas to be obtained .    by choosing @xmath76 one obtains in the limit when @xmath77 the energy e and the reduced separation constant @xmath78 correctly from the first - order phase - integral quantization conditions ( to be derived in section 3.2 ) . for arbitrary values of @xmath12",
    "it is most appropriate to determine @xmath6 and @xmath7 as functions of @xmath12 such that one obtains the same value of @xmath79 ( i.e. , of the energy ) and also of @xmath78 in the first and in the third order of the phase - integral approximation .",
    "one thereby achieves the optimal accuracy obtainable from the first - order quantization conditions .",
    "we emphasize that this can be achieved by the use of the phase - integral approximation generated from an unspecified base function ( described in the appendix ) , but can not be achieved by means of the jwkb approximation .",
    "the decisive properties of the phase - integral approximation in question versus the jwkb approximation have been explained in some detail by dammert and p.o .",
    "frman @xcite and by frman and frman @xcite .",
    "when @xmath4 is not too small , we choose @xmath80 , but when @xmath4 is sufficiently small we choose @xmath81 . for @xmath82",
    "one should always choose @xmath83 .",
    "the two alternatives @xmath80 and @xmath81 yield solutions with different properties . when @xmath80 the phase integral solutions of the differential equations ( 2.8a ) and ( 2.8b ) remain valid as @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "when @xmath81 the phase - integral solutions of the differential equations in question break down as @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively , but the regular solutions of the @xmath64- and @xmath56-equations can be obtained at some distances from those points by the use of the connection formula described in subsection a.2.b of the appendix , when one there replaces @xmath88 by @xmath89 ; cf .",
    "( 2.9a , b ) .",
    "the wave functions obtained in that way are expected to be the more accurate the stronger the coulomb singularities of @xmath65 and @xmath66 at @xmath90 and @xmath91 are . however , even if the coulomb singularities are strong , these wave functions are not expected to be good if @xmath4 is too large , in which case one should use @xmath92 , as mentioned in the beginning of this paragraph .    using the terminology classically allowed region and classically forbidden region in a generalized sense , _ viz .",

    "the phase - integral wave function is not good at @xmath114 , but for the physically acceptable wave function one can obtain a phase - integral expression in the interior of the classically allowed region , when @xmath112 and the classically forbidden region between @xmath108 and @xmath103 is sufficiently large , by means of the arbitrary - order connection formula given by ( a13 ) and ( a14 ) in the appendix , and when @xmath113 by means of the connection formula presented in subsection a.2.b of the appendix .    both when @xmath115 and when @xmath83 the wave function , obtained in the classically allowed region to the left of @xmath98 as described above , can be joined to the physically acceptable wave function traced from the classically forbidden region to the right of @xmath98 into the classically allowed region to the left of @xmath98 with the aid of the arbitrary - order connection formula given by ( a13 ) and ( a14 ) in the appendix .",
    "in this way alternative quantization conditions , corresponding to @xmath80 and @xmath81 , can be obtained .",

    "1 illustrates the two possible situations that the classically allowed region is delimited either by @xmath103 and @xmath98 [ fig .",

    "it can be shown that in a local region of the complex @xmath217-plane , where the absolute value of @xmath218 is small , the differential equation ( a1 ) has the approximate solutions                      the choice of the function @xmath211 does not affect the expressions for @xmath182 in terms of @xmath218 and @xmath229 ; only the expressions for @xmath218 and @xmath229 as functions of @xmath217 are affected .",
    "it is an essential advantage of the phase - integral approximation described above versus the carlini@xcite ( jwkb ) approximation in higher order that the former approximation contains the unspecified base function @xmath211 , which one can take advantage of in several ways .",
    "a criterion for the determination of the base function is that the function @xmath218 be in some sense small in the region of the complex @xmath217-plane that is relevant for the problem under consideration .",
    "however , this criterion does not determine the base function @xmath211 uniquely ; it turns out that , within certain limits , the results are not very sensitive to the choice of @xmath211 , when the approximation is used in higher orders . with a convenient choice of @xmath211",
    "already the first - order approximation can be very good .",
    "on the other hand an inconvenient , but possible , choice of @xmath211 introduces in the first - order approximation an unnecessarily large error that , however , in general becomes corrected already in the third - order approximation .",
    "however , the replacement of ( a7a ) by @xmath232 where the coefficient of @xmath233 should be comparatively small , does not destroy the great accuracy of the results usually obtained with the phase - integral approximation in higher orders .",
    "there is thus a whole set of base functions that may be used , and there are various ways in which one can take advantage of this nonuniqueness to make the choice of the base function well adapted to the particular problem under consideration . for instance , by adapting the choice of @xmath230 to the analytical form of @xmath234 one can sometimes achieve the result that the integrals occurring in the phase - integral approximation can be evaluated analytically . to give an example we assume that @xmath234 contains only @xmath235 but not @xmath217 itself . in this case",
    "it is convenient to replace the choice ( a7b ) by the choice @xmath236 by a convenient choice , for instance of the unspecified coefficient in ( a7b ) or ( a7c ) , one can sometimes attain the result that , for example , eigenvalues or phase - shifts are obtained exactly for some particular parameter value in every order of the phase - integral approximation . by making this exactness fulfilled in the limit of a parameter value , for which the phase - integral result without this adaptation would not be good , one can actually extend the region of validity of the phase - integral treatment ; see p. 12 in @xcite .",
    "when the differential equation contains one or more parameters , the accurate calculation of the wave function may require different choices of the base function @xmath211 for different ranges of the parameter values . to illustrate this fact we consider the radial schrdinger equation . for sufficiently large values of the angular momentum quantum number @xmath88",
    "we obtain an accurate phase - integral approximation ( valid also close to @xmath237 ) if we choose @xmath230 according to ( a7a ) or ( a7b ) . if the value of @xmath88 is too small , this phase - integral approximation is not good .",
    "it can be considerably improved ( except close to @xmath237 ) , when the absolute value of the coefficient of @xmath233 in @xmath234 is sufficiently large , if one chooses instead @xmath238    the corresponding phase - integral approximation is not valid close to @xmath237 , but the wave function that is regular and tends to @xmath239 as @xmath240 can be obtained sufficiently far away from @xmath237 by means of the connection formula that will be presented in subsection a.2.b of this appendix .",
    "the appearance of the unspecified base function @xmath211 in the phase - integral approximation is thus very important from several points of view . in our treatment of the two - centre coulomb problem",
    "we use two essentially different kinds of base function [ corresponding to @xmath115 and @xmath241 in ( 3.2a , b ) ] , which yield approximate solutions with different regions of validity .",
    "when the first - order approximation is used , it is often convenient to choose the constant lower limit of integration @xmath221 in ( a4b ) to be a zero or a first - order pole of @xmath230 .",
    "this is , however , in general not possible when a higher - order approximation is used , since the integral in ( a4b ) would then in general be divergent . if @xmath221 is an odd - order zero or an odd - order pole of @xmath230 , it is therefore convenient to replace the definition ( a4b ) of @xmath242 by the definition      where @xmath244 is a path of integration that starts at the point corresponding to @xmath217 on a riemann sheet adjacent to the complex @xmath217-plane under consideration , encircles @xmath221 in the positive or in the negative sense , and ends at @xmath217 .",
    "it is immaterial for the value of the integral in ( a8 ) if the path of integration encircles @xmath221 in the positive or in the negative sense , but the endpoint must be @xmath217 .",
    "for the first - order approximation the definitions ( a4b ) and ( a8 ) are identical .",
    "it is useful to introduce a short - hand notation for the integral in the right - hand member of ( a8 ) by the definition @xmath245 for the first order of the phase - integral approximation one can replace @xmath246 by @xmath221 in the left - hand member of ( a9 ) and thus get an ordinary integral from @xmath221 to @xmath217 instead of half of the integral along the contour @xmath244 . in analogy to ( a9 ) one defines a short - hand notation for an integral in which the upper limit of integration is an odd - order zero or an odd - order pole of @xmath230 . when one has two transition points of that kind as limits of integration , the definition of the short - hand notation with both limits within parentheses implies that the integral is equal to half of the integral along a closed loop enclosing both transition points .",
    "the simplified notation in the left - hand member of ( a9 ) for the integral in the right - hand member of ( a9 ) was introduced by frman _",
    "@xcite , pp 160 - 161 .",
    "it makes it possible to use , for an arbitrary order of the phase - integral approximation , a similar simple notation and almost the same simple language ( although in a generalized sense ) as for the first order of the phase - integral approximation .",
    "one thus achieves a great formal and practical simplification in the treatment of concrete problems , when an arbitrary order of the phase - integral approximation is used .",
    "we remark that the notations used above differ from the notations in the original papers published up to the beginning of the eighties in the respect that @xmath230 and @xmath247 in those papers correspond in the present paper to @xmath234 and @xmath230 , respectively .

    "<S> the present paper concerns the derivation of phase - integral quantization conditions for the two - centre coulomb problem under the assumption that the two coulomb centres are fixed . with this restriction we treat the general two - centre coulomb problem according to the phase - integral method , in which one uses an _ a priori _ unspecified _ base function_. we consider base functions containing three unspecified parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 . when the absolute value of the magnetic quantum number @xmath2 is not too small , it is most appropriate to choose @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> when , on the other hand , @xmath4 is sufficiently small , it is most appropriate to choose @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> arbitrary - order phase - integral quantization conditions are obtained for these choices of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 are determined from the requirement that the results of the first and the third order of the phase - integral approximation coincide , which makes the first - order approximation as good as possible .    in order to make the paper to some extent </S>",
    "<S> self - contained , a short review of the phase - integral method is given in the appendix . </S>"
