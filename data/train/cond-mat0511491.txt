    "recently , the spontaneous emission spectrum of qds embedded in a semiconductor p - n junction has been proposed as a generator of single photons , which is important in the application of quantum cryptography@xmath2 .",
    "the antibunching feature of a single photon source was demonstrated by optical and electrical pumping , respectively@xmath3 .",
    "thus far , the implementation of a single photon source has used short wavelengths ( near @xmath4 ) .",
    "for such a short wavelength photon can be generated by electron - hole recombination in the excitations including exciton , negative trion , positive trion and biexciton states@xmath5 .    in some applications of quantum communications , a long - wavelength single photon near a @xmath6 infrared wavelength",
    "is useful owing to its advantage of high transmission in the atmosphere .",
    "note that a long wavelength infrared single photon passes through the atmosphere in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands@xmath9 , the atmospheric transmission is near @xmath10 in the infrared range from @xmath11 to @xmath12 . to generate a long - wavelength single photon",
    ", we can employ electron intraband transitions .",
    "one way of realizing such photon source is to use single electron transistors ( sets ) , which consists of two leads and one qd . owing to coulomb blockade effect and pauli principle ,",
    "the sets can be utilized not only as a single photon emitter , but also a single photon detector .    to date",
    ", many nanostructure materials such as silicon ( si ) and germanium ( ge ) qds can be miniaturized by using advanced fabrication technology . furthermore , recently , the ge / si sets have been demonstrated at room temperature@xmath13.due to si and ge are multi - valley semiconductors , we propose to embed a single self - assembled inas qd into gaas slab ( with width w ) which is then placed in contact with electrodes to form n - i - n structure . in the fabrication of optoelectronic devices such as single - photon generators and single - photon detectors , material for single valley semiconductors",
    "are preferred .",
    "even though it is difficult to align a single dot with the source and drain electrodes , this difficulty may be solved by the selective formation method@xmath14 , which can improve position control and minimize the size fluctuation of self - assembly quantum dot ( saqd ) . to produce a single photon near a @xmath15 infrared wavelength",
    ", first we need to know the energy levels of a single inas qd , which depend on the shape of qds . here",
    "the pyramid - shaped inas qds with the base length b and height h will be considered since this shape is commonly observed in many experiments .    within the effective mass model@xmath5 ,",
    "the lowest three energy levels for electrons as a function of base length are shown in fig .",
    "1 , where the ratio of @xmath16 is considered . the first excited state @xmath17 is a fourfold degenerate state including spin , whereas this degenerate state will be lifted as @xmath18 and @xmath19 if the x - y axis symmetry of qd is destroyed .",
    "fano interference could be occurred due to coupling of these states to the same reservoir@xmath20 .",
    "the main purpose of this article is to theoretically investigate fano interference effect on the transition spectrum of single photons near a @xmath21 ( or @xmath22 infrared wavelength .",

    "the new hamiltonian takes the form    @xmath36    where the renormalized energy levels of qd are @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we see that the time - dependent phase in the inter - level hamiltonian vanishes",
    ". however , the hopping terms are time dependent , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , in which the energy and time dependence of the coupling are factorized .",
    "this factorization leads to time - independent tunneling rates . even though the effect of electron correlation is significant in small semiconductor qds",
