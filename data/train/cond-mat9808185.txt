    "orbital dynamics in a number of heavy - fermion systems has recently attracted great interest @xcite . in the presence of orbital degeneracy , orbital ( electric ) tensors in addition to spin ones",
    "have an opportunity to be active , and shows rich phenomena resulting from entanglement with spin ( magnetic ) degrees of freedom .",
    "the orbital degrees of freedom couple with lattice ones , and often lead to the jahn - teller effect .",
    "in other cases , a quenching mechanism for these degrees of freedom such as the orbital kondo effect prevents static distortion of the lattice .",
    "hence study of the coupled spin and orbital fluctuations should be important for understanding heavy - fermion systems as a whole .    under a high symmetry such as the cubic one , there are chances for the orbital degeneracy to remain .",
    "a typical example is the cubic compound ceb@xmath2 : its crystal - field ground state is the @xmath6 quartet which consists of two degenerate kramers doublets .",
    "the excited doublet @xmath7 is well separated by about 540k @xcite and plays little role in low - energy physics .",
    "ceb@xmath2 exhibits curious phase diagram at low temperature in magnetic field @xcite . the phase boundary between the paramagnetic phase , called i , and the antiferro - quadrupolar phase called ii shows unusual dependence on magnetic field : transition temperature increases as magnetic field increases .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the phase ii has been ascribed either to the intersite interactions between higher - order multipoles @xcite , or the quadrupolar fluctuations @xcite .    in the course of systematic dilution study @xcite , a strange phase , called iv ,",
    "is observed recently in ce@xmath0la@xmath1b@xmath2 .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility shows a cusp on entering the phase iv from the paramagnetic phase i with decreasing temperature .",
    "this suggests that the nel state is present here .",
    "in contrast to the phase iii which has both antiferromagnetic and quadrupolar orders , the phase iv has a very small magnetic anisotropy in the susceptibility@xcite and almost no magneto resistance@xcite . in realizing this phase the interplay between intersite correlation and on - site kondo effect seems to be essential .    in a previous paper @xcite ,",
    "one of the present authors noted the importance of the orbital kondo effect in understanding the phase iv ; the orbital kondo effect can be active even in the presence of a spin ordering .",
    "then a new method was proposed to perform perturbative renormalization to arbitrary higher orders . in order to quantify the idea ,",
    "however , one must estimate actual magnitude of relevant interactions under the realistic point - group symmetry .",
    "up to the present , investigation of the kondo - type interaction in the presence of crystalline - electric - field ( cef ) effects has been made by various methods @xcite .",
    "it has turned out essential to take into account the splitting of the localized states in accordance with the point - group symmetry @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the effective exchange interaction needs many parameters for characterization . in the conventional field",
    "theoretical scaling procedure , it is tedious to deal with such large number of parameters .    in this paper",
    "we generalize the scaling method of ref .",
    "@xcite so as to be applicable to arbitrary point - group symmetry .",
    "the scaling equations for symmetry adapted coupling constants are written down generally in terms of structure constants of the relevant lie algebra . as a specific case , the third - order scaling for the cubic symmetry is performed explicitly with minimum amount of intermediate steps .",
    "we show that the pseudospin representing the orbital moment has an anisotropic exchange interaction as a result of scaling . on the other hand",
    "the magnetic pseudospin remains isotropic in the case where the @xmath3-@xmath5 fluctuation dominates the @xmath3-@xmath4 one .",
    "since the third - order scaling does not work for a strong - coupling fixed point , the local fermi liquid can not be identified by the present approach as it stands . however , with available knowledge from various sources , we can almost certainly classify all the fixed points of the model .",
    "it turns out that there is an unexpected symmetry in the exchange interaction which interchanges both the spin and orbital indices simultaneously .",
    "we show that this hidden symmetry is specific to the su(2)@xmath8su(2 ) symmetry which is relevant to the @xmath6 cef state .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the following section , we describe the method to derive the effective exchange interaction starting form the anderson model .",
    "this section is mainly adaptation of earlier treatment @xcite to respect the point group symmetry from the beginning .",
    "the details of explicit derivation are given in appendix a. in section iii we derive the third - order scaling equation in the most general case of the point group . in section",
    "iv we apply the general result to the specific case of the ce@xmath0la@xmath1b@xmath2 system and give detailed analysis of the scaling equations .",
    "the final section summarizes the present paper with implication to identifying the mysterious phase iv .",
    "the atomic structure of a single magnetic ion with @xmath9 electrons is treated by the cef theory together with the russell - saunders ( @xmath10 ) coupling scheme . in this scheme the local state",
    "is specified uniquely by the following quantum numbers : the number of @xmath9 electrons @xmath11 , the orbital , the spin and the total angular moments @xmath12 , and the irreducible representation @xmath13 ( abbreviated as irrep ) of the double point - group with time - reversal operation and its component @xmath14 together with the branching multiplicity label @xmath15 , which is required for the case where the irrep @xmath13 occurs more than once ( e.g. @xmath16 for tetragonal symmetry ) .",
    "we often abbreviate the local states @xmath17 as @xmath18 for notational simplicity . in the same manner",
    "the one - particle state of @xmath9 electron is described as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the abbreviation of @xmath21 with @xmath22 being the multiplicity label , and @xmath23 specifying the irrep of the one - particle state .",
    "the corresponding creation operator is written as @xmath24 .",
    "it is useful to express a bloch state conduction operator @xmath25 using @xmath26 with the symmetry adapted basis around the impurity    the anderson hamiltonian then takes the form : @xmath27,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we restrict the hybridization between the local and the conduction electrons to the same set of symmetry ( not only @xmath28 but also @xmath29 ) .",
    "we regard the label @xmath20 as the channel index of independent scattering processes and @xmath30 as the internal degrees of freedom which is responsible for the kondo effect .",
    "if the most stable configuration @xmath11 is well separated from @xmath31 ones , one can restrict the model space @xcite to the multiplet @xmath32 by integrating out the virtual charge fluctuations to the @xmath31 configurations .",

    "the exchange process via the excited configurations is shown schematically in fig.[fig1 ] .",

    "these are natural extensions of the @xmath52 and @xmath53 symbols of wigner .",
    "it is clear that the tensor operator @xmath54 transforms like the ket @xmath55 , or equivalently like the bra @xmath56 , under the point - group operations .",
    "the irreps of the localized - state tensors are determined so as to have the finite @xmath49 symbols .",
    "namely , decompositions of the direct product @xmath57 contains @xmath58 .",
    "similar decomposition also determines the irreps of the conduction - electron tensors .",
    "we write the exchange interaction @xmath59 as another matrix @xmath60 in the invariant form . namely eq.([eq1 ] ) is equivalently written as @xmath61 here the @xmath48 symbol is inserted in the exchange interaction . with the rotational symmetry , eq.([eqexe ] )",
    "reduces to the known result involving the spherical tensors @xcite .",

    "moreover , both the initial and the final states belong to the ground - state cef multiplet @xmath70 . then the localized - state tensors become hermitian and all have definite signs with respect to the time - reversal operation .",
    "the conduction - electron tensor does not have the definite sign in general , since the time - reversal operation interchanges @xmath71 with @xmath20 .",

    "is automatically imposed for the different channels .",
    "this property was essential to derive the two - channel kondo hamiltonian for tetragonal and hexagonal symmetries @xcite .",

    "the renormalization evolution is shown in fig.[fig4 ] for the initial coupling constants @xmath206 with various values of the ratio @xmath207 .",
    "the two different characteristic energies corresponding to @xmath208 and @xmath203 merge together as @xmath41 approaches unity .    before closing this section",
    ", we discuss the hidden symmetry @xmath209 .",
    "let us consider the following particle - hole transformation for the conduction electrons : @xmath210 where the matrices @xmath211 and @xmath212 are unitary .",

    "the spin operators @xmath213 and @xmath214 are transformed respectively as @xmath215 where the minus signs come from the anticommutation of conduction - electron operators . the transformed spin operators with bars are given by @xmath216^t,\\;\\;\\ ; \\bar{\\rho}^\\alpha=[s^\\dagger\\rho^\\alpha s]^t.\\ ] ] let us assume the presence of unitary transformations @xmath211 and @xmath212 which make the transformed spin operators proportional to the original one .",

    "there indeed exist such transformations in the case of the su(2 ) symmetry ; the matrices are given by @xmath224 which give @xmath225 . however , in the case of su(@xmath226 ) symmetry with @xmath227 , such transformations can not be found since the rank of the su(@xmath226 ) symmetry is higher than 2 .",

    "in this paper we have proposed a systematic procedure to derive the exchange interaction and the scaling equations up to third order with maximum use of the point - group symmetry .",
    "various moments are described by the irreducible tensors with proper time - reversal property .",
    "then the exchange interaction is obtained in the scalar - product form of the irreducible tensors .",
    "the third - order scaling equations for symmetry adapted coupling constants are written down generally in terms of structure constants of the relevalnt lie algebra .",
    "the procedure is applied to the case of ce@xmath0la@xmath1b@xmath2 where the cef ground quartet @xmath6 shows rich phenomena resulting from the entanglement of electric and magnetic tensors .",
    "we derive the exchange interaction integrating out the charge fluctuations to @xmath5 or @xmath4 configurations .",
    "we discuss the nature of scaling for the case where the @xmath3-@xmath5 fluctuation dominates over the @xmath3-@xmath4 one . in this case , main contribution to the kondo screening comes from the partial waves with @xmath151 , @xmath6 symmetry of conduction electrons .    as a result of scaling ,",
    "the effective exchange interaction is described by the @xmath174-@xmath175 double exchange model with the exchange anisotropy in @xmath175 space . the anisotropy comes from the fact that one of three components of the orbital pseudospin @xmath124 has different time - reversal property from others .",
    "the effective exchange model has non - fermi - liquid fixed points in the absence of the @xmath174-@xmath175 coupled term . in the presence of the coupled term",
    "the system flows to the local fermi - liquid fixed point .",
    "the different characteristic energies corresponding to the exchange couplings for either @xmath174 or and @xmath175 rapidly merge together with increasing magnitude of the coupling .",
    "if one considers only the time - reversal difference , the system has also two different characteristic energies corresponding to the electric and the magnetic exchange interactions .",
    "we identify the special symmetry of su(2 ) , which plays an important role to reject the non - fermi - liquid fixed point resulting from the argument of su(@xmath226)@xmath8su(@xmath228 ) exchange model in the large limit of @xmath226 and @xmath228 @xcite .",
    "concerning the physical quantities in the intermediate regime toward the fixed point , magnetic and electric quantities can have different energy scales .",
    "therefore , conventional argument with the single kondo temperature has to be revised in the presence of the orbital degeneracy .",
    "this should affect previous analysis of the resistivity and magnetic susceptibility .",
    "for this purpose , quantitative argument is required beyond the perturbative scaling analysis . in the forthcoming paper",
    "we use the numerical renormalization group @xcite to derive physical quantities at finite temperature .    in the presence of intersite interactions ,",
    "the orbital and spin degeneracies can be split by a molecular field associated with the long - range order .",
    "it is known that ce@xmath0la@xmath1b@xmath2 has at least four different phases . of these the phase ii",
    "is characterized by the orbital ( or quadrupole ) order without magnetic order .",
    "the magnetic order present in the phase iii seems to accompany the orbital order .",
    "if the molecular field corresponds to the internal magnetic field , not only spin but orbital degeneracy are lifted because zeeman splitting depends on each orbital .",
    "provided that the intersite spin exchange interaction is stronger than the orbital one , we can think of the situation where the spin kondo effect gives way to the long - range order but the orbital kondo effect does not .",
    "in such a situation the magnetically ordered phase should keep the nearly isotropic magnetic property as in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "we expect that a detailed quantitative study with the scenario described above will provide us with understanding the nature of the curious phase iv in ce@xmath0la@xmath1b@xmath2",
