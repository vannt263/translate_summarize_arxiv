    "the existence of dark matter was discovered in galaxy clusters where the velocity dispersions are nearly an order of magnitude higher than expected from the gravitational binding provided by the stellar masses of their visible galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "clusters are gravitationally bound , quasi - equilibrium systems assembled over a hubble time via the infall of the mass in the surrounding field ( @xcite ) , which implies that both the dark matter and the galaxies within clusters have their origins in the field . because clusters are large systems that draw their mass and galaxy content from regions 20  across , measurements of cluster @xmath1 values should be representative of the field value , although not necessarily identical to it because of differential galaxy evolution .",
    "the product of the field @xmath1 with the field luminosity density , @xmath17 , is equal to the mean mass density of the universe , @xmath18 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cosmological density parameter , @xmath19 , is therefore estimated as the ratio of the cluster @xmath1 ( corrected to the field ) to the @xmath20 for closure ( @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath21 estimate has no dependence on @xmath22 for dynamically measured cluster masses ( @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is mainly to correct our cluster virial mass - to - light ratio , @xmath0 , ( carlberg ,  1996 , hereafter @xcite ) to the field @xmath1 .",
    "cluster dynamical masses are usually calculated from the virial mass estimator , @xmath11 , which has the drawback that it makes explicit assumptions about the dynamical state of the clusters .",
    "its reliability is critically dependent on the galaxy population being in dynamical equilibrium with the cluster potential and the galaxy distribution having the same spatial distribution as the total mass distribution of the cluster .",
    "measured virial mass - to - light ratios of clusters , @xmath0 , are generally in the range @xmath23 ( @xcite ) which , in ratio to @xmath24 ( @xcite ) indicates @xmath25 .",
    "cluster @xmath26 values have not generally been accepted as conclusive because there are a number of uncontrolled sources of possible systematic error .",
    "for instance , cluster galaxies with blue colors are known to have a higher velocity dispersion and are more extended than the red galaxies ( @xcite ) leading to virial mass estimates that are about a factor of four different for our dataset .",
    "the substantial color difference between cluster and field galaxies opens up the possibility that their luminosities per unit mass are quite different . the assumptions which go into the cluster @xmath21 calculation need to be tested for their validity for a specific sample .",
    "the possibility that the mass distributions of galaxy clusters are more extended than their constituent galaxy populations has been recognized for many years ( @xcite ) .",
    "the detection problem is that dynamical mass estimators do not have any useful sensitivity to cluster mass outside the orbits of the galaxies .",
    "a specific situation which leads to this bias is found in n - body simulations of cluster buildup in an @xmath27 cosmology with a realistic amount of substructure ( @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the simulated `` galaxies '' become more concentrated within the cluster than its mass .",
    "that is , the virial mass calculated from the `` galaxies '' systematically underestimates the total mass of the cluster in these simulations by as much as order of magnitude .",
    "there are some observational indications of the possibility of a higher @xmath21 than that calculated from virial masses .",
    "detailed mass modeling for the coma cluster gives a projected mass of @xmath28 within @xmath29 of the center ( with a normal mass - to - light ratio , @xcite ) , whereas the virial mass is generally taken to be @xmath30 for the same region .",
    "however , this can also be ascribed to the substantial cluster to cluster variations in the shape of the velocity dispersion profile ( @xcite ) due to the asphericity and substructure within individual clusters .",
    "another indication comes from substructure , which is a complication in the analysis of clusters as individuals , but can be turned to advantage as an indirect , model dependent , @xmath21 estimator .",
    "the results of substructure analysis remain controversial : some workers favor @xmath31 ( @xcite ) , while others suggest much smaller @xmath21 values ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cnoc ( canadian network for observational cosmology ) cluster redshift survey is designed to derive a cluster @xmath26 within a homogenous , self - contained , sample where we can explicitly test for systematic errors .",
    "the catalogues contain @xmath322600 redshifts in the fields of 16 clusters ( @xcite ) from which @xcite ) derived an average @xmath33 ( calculated with @xmath10 ) .",
    "the clusters are consistent with having a universal @xmath0 value ( within the errors of about 25% ) independent of their velocity dispersion , mean color of their galaxies , blue galaxy content , or mean interior density .",
    "the field galaxies in the dataset , with the same corrections , over the same redshift range , yield the closure mass - to - light ratio , @xmath34 , to be @xmath35 .",
    "consequently the virial mass - to - light ratio implies @xmath36 at a mean redshift of 0.32 , where the error is the formal @xmath16 random error .",
    "in @xcite the derived @xmath21 was erroneously corrected to a redshift zero @xmath26 .",
    "the calculation uses a co - moving volume element ( @xmath37 dependent ) and hubble constant which are both redshift zero values which do not need further corrections .",
    "testing the accuracy of the virial mass was a primary consideration in the design of the cnoc observations .",
    "the data allow us to derive a radially resolved projected number density profile , @xmath38 , and a projected velocity dispersion , @xmath39 ( in the following , @xmath40 is used for projected radius ; whereas @xmath8 denotes the spherical co - ordinate ) .",
    "the sample meets the two main requirements for deriving a radially resolved mass profile which are , first , accurate control of the background , and second , enough clusters to average over the aspherical complications of individual clusters . in section 2",
    "we review the properties of our sample .",
    "we define scaling velocities and radii which we use in section 3 to combine all but two `` binary '' clusters to create an `` ensemble cluster '' .",
    "this averaging increases the signal - to - noise ratio of our measurements , and is sufficient to justify the assumption of an equilibrium , spherical , cluster in the analysis .",
    "the clusters are sampled to densities in redshift space that are comparable to the field density , requiring a background subtraction which is discussed in section 4 .",
    "the mean surface density profile of galaxies within the cluster is derived in section 5 , and fitted with a spatial density profile .",
    "the projected velocity dispersion profile is derived in section 6 , and fitted to a radial velocity dispersion function for a variety of orbital shape assumptions . using these results",
    "the mass - to - light profile is derived from jeans equation in section  7 . in section  8",
    "we examine the relative colors and luminosities of field and cluster galaxies as a measurement of the differential evolution of the two populations .",
    "the corrections and error budget are presented in section 9 , followed by our conclusions and discussion in section 10 .",
    "the cnoc sample is designed to create a dataset that allows as complete internal control of all aspects of the cluster @xmath21 estimate as possible .",
    "it is essential that the sample be useful for a test of the equilibrium hypothesis and whether the virial mass is biased in some way .",
    "furthermore the sample is used to measure differential luminosity evolution between cluster and field galaxies . on the basis of some n - body simulation data ( @xcite )",
    "it was argued that these could be best met within the constraints of available observational resources with a set of a dozen or so clusters at @xmath41 with a total of 3000 or so accurate redshifts .",
    "the cluster sample was chosen from the einstein medium sensitivity survey catalogue of x - ray clusters ( @xcite ) to have a high x - ray luminosity , @xmath42 erg  s@xmath43 , which helps guarantee that the clusters are reasonably virialized and have relatively high masses , making them easier to study .",
    "the clusters chosen , table  [ tab : r200 ] , are at moderate redshifts , @xmath44 , which has a number of advantages for mass estimation .",
    "they are sufficiently distant that they have a significant redshift interval over which the density of foreground and background galaxies are nearly uniformly sampled in redshift . at @xmath14 , a typical cluster diameter of",
    "@xmath45  ( comoving ) spans an angle of about 12 , which is sufficiently small that uniformity of photometry and sample selection is relatively easily assured .",
    "this angle is also comparable to the field size of the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) multiple - object - spectrograph ( @xcite ) , approximately 10  square .",
    "observations were made at cfht in 24 assigned nights in 1993 and 1994 , of which 22 were usefully clear .",
    "the sample and observational techniques are described in detail elsewhere ( @xcite ) .",
    "the primary catalogues contain gunn @xmath8 magnitudes and @xmath46 colors for 25,000 objects , of which about 2600 have velocities , on the average accurate to about 100  .",
    "about one - third of the sample is cluster galaxies .",
    "the other two - thirds are field galaxies , although less than half of them are within the fair sample region defined by the band - limiting filter s passband and a @xmath47 buffer zone added to the upper and lower cluster redshift range . for reasons of observational efficiency , the survey is not `` complete '' in the usual sense .",
    "hence , each object with a redshift has calculated weights which are the inverse of the magnitude selection function and the magnitude - dependent geometric selection function ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are small changes in the cluster dynamical parameters of table  [ tab : r200 ] from those in the global analysis ( @xcite ) .",
    "the values here are derived using the final survey catalogues which accounts for the small changes from those given in earlier papers .",
    "all calculations in this paper assume @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , although these choices do not affect our main conclusions in any significant way .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to measure any systematic biases in @xmath0 as an estimator of the field value .",
    "this is done by independently measuring the mass and constraining differential luminosity evolution of cluster and field galaxies .",
    "we adopt the virial mass , @xmath51 as the standard estimator , where 1  and @xmath52 are defined below in equations  [ eq : sig ] and [ eq : rv ] .",
    "the drawback of the virial mass is that it is a statistically `` inefficient '' estimator ( @xcite ) .",
    "its positive features are that it is completely independent of the distribution of orbital shapes and it is not unduly sensitive to background contamination .",
    "an alternate estimator is the projected mass ( @xcite ) , which we calculated but do not report .",
    "its main drawback is that it is quite sensitive to background contamination of the data at large radii . for the standard velocity ellipsoid shape",
    "the projected mass is always larger than the virial mass , which we find below already overestimates the cluster mass .",
    "hence , we adopted the virial mass as our standard estimator .",
    "the first step in testing the accuracy of @xmath11 is to construct a low - noise , effectively spherical , `` ensemble '' cluster , which averages over internal substructure and the variation of projected quantities with viewing angle .",
    "our clusters span about a factor of two in velocity dispersion and hence are not a uniform set of physically identical objects . simply overlaying all the clusters onto a common center of mass in physical velocity and position units has some significant advantages ( an approach that will be pursued in another paper ) , but has the disadvantage that any gradients of density or velocity dispersion tend to be blurred out .",
    "the natural scaling parameters are each cluster s rms velocity dispersion and the characteristic radius at which the cluster is expected to be in an effective equilibrium , which turns out to be a function of the rms velocity dispersion , alone , within our approximation .",
    "deciding which galaxies in redshift space are cluster members is fundamentally ambiguous .",
    "that is , a cluster galaxy with a completely reasonable line - of - sight velocity of @xmath53 appears in redshift space at 10  from the cluster s center of mass , far outside the virialized cluster and overlaying field galaxies .",
    "this complication increases in severity at large distances from the cluster center , which our sample is specifically designed to probe .",
    "one straightforward solution to this problem , which we adopt , is to explicitly subtract the mean density of field galaxies in redshift space from the cluster distribution .",
    "the internal kinetic energy of the cluster is calculated from the characteristic velocity dispersion , @xmath54 .",
    "we iterate the classical estimator @xmath55 where the @xmath56 are the peculiar velocities in the frame of the cluster and @xmath57 is the weighted mean redshift of the cluster .",
    "the weights are calculated from the redshift and photometric catalogues to allow for statistical incompleteness of sampling ( @xcite ) .",
    "the key to the use of this estimator is to have an objective choice of the galaxies that are likely to be cluster members .",
    "the adopted method ( @xcite ) is as follows .",
    "first a choice of the cluster redshift range is made from which a trial 1  is calculated .",
    "then all galaxies between 5 and 15 1  are used to make a background estimate , which is subtracted from the weights of the galaxies selected to be in the cluster .",
    "if the 1  calculated from the background subtracted weights is within the 68% bootstrap confidence range of the trial 1  ( @xcite ) , then the procedure is stopped ; otherwise , the redshift limits are increased or decreased to find a convergence .    precisely the same galaxies as determined to be `` in the cluster '' from our 1  calculation",
    "are given to the iterated bi - weight estimator ( @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting estimates of the velocity dispersion are , on the average , @xmath58 times larger than from our method .",
    "we find below that the global mean velocity dispersion of the combined dataset , normalized with our 1  values , is @xmath59 , whereas it should be unity , which is consistent with either scheme for calculating the velocity dispersions .",
    "since the outcome of this investigation is that @xmath11 is biased upwards , the bi - weight calculation would lead to a further increase in the bias .    for each cluster",
    "a `` ringwise '' estimate of the virial radius of the observed distribution is calculated ( see @xcite for details ) : @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind in legendre s notation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the angular extent of the sample is set by the observed field size .",
    "the redshift range is as found in the velocity dispersion calculation .",
    "the goal is that our data will include the entire virialized mass of the cluster .",
    "analytic models ( @xcite ) and simulation data ( @xcite ) find that the virialized mass is generally contained inside the surface where the mean interior density is @xmath63 at the redshift of the cluster . the mean interior density within our measured @xmath52 is @xmath64 in terms of the measured dynamical parameters",
    "this is @xmath65 where the hubble constant at @xmath66 is @xmath67 $ ] ( @xcite ) .",
    "normally we take @xmath49 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 for an open frw model .",
    "the mean density inside @xmath52 serves as a check as to whether the radial extent of the cluster is sufficiently sampled to determine a virial radius that includes most of the virialized mass .",
    "table  [ tab : r200 ] gives the values for @xmath52 , @xmath54 , and @xmath70 , in columns 3 , 4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "the sampling over - density @xmath70 varies substantially from cluster to cluster , which mainly indicates the radial extent of our coverage of a given cluster .",
    "the observations used here extend beyond 200 for most clusters .",
    "the exceptions are ms1006@xmath7112 , ms1008@xmath7212 , and ms1455@xmath7122 where the data extend to about 2/3 to 3/4 of 200 .",
    "the cluster s virial mass to k - corrected gunn @xmath8 luminosity , @xmath0 , and its errors are given in columns 6 and 7 of table  [ tab : r200 ] .",
    "the numbers are slightly different than those found in @xcite because these results are based on the finalized catalogues .",
    "to calculate 200 , the radius where the mean interior density is @xmath73 , requires an assumption as to how the mass is distributed .",
    "one possibility is that the mass is strongly concentrated to the center of the cluster such that all the mass measured by @xmath11 is inside the measured @xmath52 , in which case , @xmath74^{1/3}. \\label{eq : rp200}\\ ] ] this definition of @xmath75 is not particularly appropriate when @xmath76 , as it is for our best sampled clusters , because the cluster galaxies , and presumably the mass as well , extend beyond @xmath75 .",
    "a superior 200  is calculated assuming a density - radius model which is extrapolated to the desired overdensity . simplicity , and a great deal of work on clusters of galaxies and the properties of dark halos in general",
    ", suggests that the first approximation for the density - radius relation is the singular isothermal sphere , @xmath77 , in which case we define , @xmath78^{1/2},\\ ] ] or equivalently , @xmath79 note that @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "that is , 200  is independent of the angular extent of the sampling , in so far as the cluster s 1  value has no radial dependence , which for the shallow gradients of the velocity dispersion profile found below is effectively true . at @xmath82 a low density , flat universe gives a value of 200  about 13% larger than in a open universe .",
    "values of @xmath83 and 200  are given in columns 8 and 10 of table  [ tab : r200 ] in units of physical  for our cluster sample .",
    "for our sample these two 200  estimates have very similar values , so the results are not sensitive to the mass model .",
    "the jacknife error estimates for @xmath83 and 200  in  are given in columns 9 and 11 , respectively .",
    "all of the following analysis will use 200  as the scaling radius .",
    "two of the clusters , ms0906 + 11 and ms1358 + 62 , are strong binaries , the first having an ill determined velocity dispersion and the second having a massive substructure on one side moving at 1000 relative to the cluster center .",
    "these are dropped from all further use in this paper .",
    "the scaled velocity - radius data for the remaining clusters are displayed in figure  [ fig : cvt ] plotted using the brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) as the projected center and the weighted average redshift as the velocity center .",
    "all of the cluster properties presented in this paper are measured using galaxies with redshifts .",
    "the clusters typically extend over a velocity range of @xmath84 , which in redshift space causes orbitting cluster galaxies to be intermingled with field galaxies within a 50  distance interval around the cluster .",
    "background and foreground galaxies that are projected into the redshift space of the cluster must be statistically removed .",
    "this survey was deliberately placed at moderate redshift to give a field sample over a considerable redshift column from which the background density can be accurately measured .",
    "the background density is measured in the normalized velocity - radius space of figure  [ fig : cvt ] .",
    "it should be noted that the sampling in figure  [ fig : cvt ] varies substantially with both velocity and radius which is addressed with redshift cutoffs and magnitude and position dependent weights ( @xcite ) .",
    "the background and foreground are folded on top of one another within the unbiased redshift sample range of the band limiting filters which removes any linear gradients present in the redshift distribution .",
    "there are two approaches to background subtraction used in the following calculations . for the surface density calculation we use the straightforward average over the sky area",
    "the velocity dispersion calculation takes a more cautious approach to background subtraction .",
    "a resolved background is derived in precisely the same range of projected radii for which @xmath85 is calculated .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that the contamination of the cluster velocity profile with various nearby groups of galaxies is subtracted in the range of projected radii where they contribute to the background .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath85 calculated from non - overlapping radial ranges are completely independent of each other .",
    "the surface number density profile of the average cluster , @xmath38 , is the projection over velocity onto the radius axis , @xmath40 , of the data of figure  [ fig : cvt ] . to find @xmath38 , we sum the statistical weights ( which correct for nonuniform sampling , @xcite ) for objects within 31  of zero velocity , divide by the bin area , and subtract the mean background .",
    "we prefer the bcgs as the projected centers ( @xcite ) , but repeat most of the analysis using the peak of the smoothed density profile as the centers , which gives a useful view of systematic effects in the analysis .",
    "the mean background volume density in velocity space , @xmath86 , is calculated by summing over the entire range of @xmath87 using the background in the velocity range of 5 to 25 1 .",
    "we find that @xmath88 , in units of the normalized total numbers per 1 per @xmath89 .",
    "figure  [ fig : back ] shows the variation of the average background density with velocity separation ( in normalized units ) from the cluster . between 3 and 61 , the background calculated from the full sample ( left panel ) is higher than expected for a high velocity tail like a gaussian .",
    "this excess is statistically significant at about the 3 standard deviation level , and results from various small groups that happen to be behind the low redshift clusters .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : back ] shows the background calculated after the 7 clusters with @xmath90 are dropped .",
    "the rapid decline of clustering with redshift leads to a smoother distribution in redshift in the right panel .",
    "the mean background is calculated over the entire 5 to 251  interval for the full sample , so a local excess makes little difference . as a sidelight we note that near the cluster center , 1 - 31 , the velocity distribution is possibly somewhat `` squarer '' than a gaussian distribution .",
    "that is , for a gaussian the ratio of the numbers between 1 and 21  and 0 to 11  is about 1/3 , whereas we have more than 1/2 .",
    "this is likely an indicator that the cluster velocity ellipsoids are somewhat radially anisotropic ( @xcite ) .    to check the sensitivity of the derived @xmath38 to the assumed background level we repeat the calculation using values for @xmath86 of 0.0048 and 0.0082 , which are 2 standard deviations from the mean value .",
    "the only part of the profile substantially affected is beyond 200 , with alternate values being just within the 1 standard deviation range of the estimated density at that point .",
    "that is , for our adopted bin widths the statistical error due to sample size generally exceeds the uncertainty in the background subtraction .",
    "the fitted profiles described below have scale radii altered by 1.5% for a 26% variation of the background .",
    "we conclude that the background subtraction is not a dominant source of error for @xmath38 .",
    "the background subtracted @xmath38 are displayed in figure  [ fig : surf ] and tabulated in table  [ tab : surf ] .",
    "the vertical normalization of @xmath38 is a fixed , but arbitrary , value . in table",
    "[ tab : surf ] the number density @xmath91 ( column 2 ) is measured about the bcg , and @xmath92 ( column 4 ) is measured about the peak of the 45  gaussian smoothed density map . within @xmath93 of the center",
    "the density profile is strongly dependent on the choice of center . because there is usually no galaxy at the point of peak density",
    ", there is a slight dip in the central surface density when measured about the peak of the smoothed density distribution .",
    "the choice of center makes little difference to the measured @xmath38 at radii beyond @xmath93 , approximately 100 , but it does affect fits to a specific model .",
    "the point of peak density generally has sufficiently large errors that it could be consistent with being at the bcg , hence we always prefer the bcg center for physical reasons ( @xcite ) . outside of @xmath6",
    "the surface density is comparable to the background but the data are very sparse , which together cause the surface density at large radius to be quite uncertain .",
    "no data beyond @xmath6 are used in the velocity dispersion analysis .",
    "the surface luminosity density profile was also derived ; but , being weighted to the brightest galaxies , it is a noisier quantity than the number density .",
    "we find that the luminosity density profile shape is essentially the same as the density distribution .    the spatial galaxy number density as a function of radius , @xmath94 , is needed to compare the galaxy number profile with the cluster mass profile .",
    "the relation between the volume density and the surface density is , @xmath95 a statistically adequate , analytically convenient , model that describes these data is the hernquist ( alternatively designated as an @xmath96 ) model ( @xcite ) .",
    "we fit the data centered on the bcg of figure  [ fig : surf ] to the projection of the volume density model , @xmath97 this procedure for finding a @xmath94 consistent with the @xmath38 data is not unique , there being both the minor variation of using one of several other entirely reasonable fitting functions , or , adopting a completely different approach such as the non - parametric , maximum likelihood method ( @xcite ) modified to allow for background subtraction .",
    "the function @xmath98 ( @xcite ) is also a statistically acceptable fit with a slightly increased @xmath99 .",
    "our measured @xmath38 falls faster than this function predicts at large @xmath40 , but at these radii our measurement is relatively uncertain .",

    "using the @xmath38 measured about the peak light gives a considerably larger scale radius , @xmath103 , with @xmath104 .",
    "this larger value of @xmath105 is at least in part due to a blurring of the density profile by statistical errors in measuring the position of peak number density .",
    "although we believe it is a less appropriate choice for the cluster centers for these data , we carry it along in the analysis as an indicator of systematic errors .",
    "the measurement of @xmath85 is a second moment of the velocity distribution about the local mean velocity at projected radius @xmath40 , although the choice of central moment makes essentially no difference to the result .",
    "the projected velocity dispersion at @xmath40 , @xmath85 , is calculated using an iterative clipping of the high velocity dispersion tails with a technique similar to that used for the rms velocity dispersion in @xcite , where @xmath54 is calculated from the background subtracted data within @xmath106 of zero velocity , where @xmath107 .",
    "the iteration begins with @xmath108 in the 1  normalized velocities . for the next four iterations the @xmath85 from the previous iteration",
    "is used for clipping . for a 10% change in the clipping level , @xmath109 , the resulting velocity dispersion changes about 1% at large radii .",
    "the error flags are calculated from a full bootstrap resampling of both the cluster and field data .    rather than radially binning the data",

    "the random errors of the derived @xmath85 of the ensemble are dominated by cluster to cluster fluctuations . within an individual cluster ( for instance a2390 )",
    "the random errors are substantially smaller , but there are large differences in velocity dispersion profiles from cluster to cluster ( @xcite ) which we attribute to projection effects and substructure . at large radii ,",
    "dynamical measurements from a single cluster likely do not give reliable enclosed masses because of the complications of infall , triaxiality and substructure .",
    "the idea of creating the ensemble cluster is of course to diminish these systematic variations to the level where an effectively spherically symmetric average profile emerges .    to derive a @xmath111 which is consistent with the observed @xmath85 we use the same approach as we used for the density profile",

    "in addition , radial models are usually dynamically unstable to the radial orbit instability ( @xcite ) . however , the galaxies are only tracers , so in principle they could be on much more radial orbits than the underlying dark matter . on the other hand , it seems likely that galaxies orbiting past the center may be tidally destroyed or simply well mixed so that the galaxy velocity ellipsoid near the center may become less radial than the dark matter .",
    "equation  [ eq : jeans ] is integrated with the boundary condition that @xmath129 as @xmath130 .",

    "the galaxy number density profile , which we will call the light profile , is normalized to a mass using a mass - to - light ratio calculated in the same manner as done for our clusters individually .",
    "there are two complications in this calculation which need to be examined .",
    "first , the clusters are not all sampled to the same fraction of 200 .",
    "second , both the @xmath52 and the total light are calculated without any allowance for background contamination . to investigate these effects we calculate @xmath147 using the mean profile , both with and without background subtraction , limiting the data at various @xmath148 .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : mlrad ] .    remarkably , the ratio @xmath147 is almost entirely independent of background contamination and sampling radius , once @xmath149 .",

    "because the gradient is small the exact radius used does not make a big difference .",

    "the gradients are sufficiently small that for a wide range of @xmath114 they are consistent with there being no gradient of @xmath1 . in no case",
    "are the gradients sufficiently large that there is any possibility that the cluster has a dark matter halo that is significantly more extended than the visible galaxies .      we have found that the virial mass , as we have calculated from the data , is about a 20% overestimate of the true mass .",
    "the origin of this factor needs to be quantitatively understood .",
    "we believe that this bias is simply the approximation that the surface pressure term in the virial equation is zero . for our fitted functional forms for the density profile and the velocity dispersion profile , ( equations [ eq : nu ] and [ eq : sigfit ] , respectively ) , we can provide an estimate of the expected `` truncation bias '' .",
    "truncating a density profile of the form eq .",
    "[ eq : nu ] , @xmath162 , will cause the true mass contained within that radius to be overestimated , as quantified below .",
    "the potential energy scalar , @xmath163 , of the density distribution truncated at @xmath164 is , @xmath165 calculating the virial radius as @xmath166 we find that @xmath167 the estimated virial radius is @xmath168 if the distribution is sampled to infinity distribution , whereas for our combined clusters we have measured the virial radius to be @xmath169 ( using the @xmath105 found from the fit of the distribution with background subtraction ) .",

    "the usual assumption for dynamical systems is that @xmath172 is evaluated as @xmath175 , where it is zero .",

    "this estimated mass is greater than the true global value . at @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath182 and @xmath183 it evaluates to 8/5 , 5/4 , 8/7 and 35/32 , respectively .",
    "that is , the mass estimated from the averaged distribution is expected to overestimate the true value by about 10 to 20% .",
    "clusters that are not sampled to large radii will have a larger truncation bias but smaller background contamination in the projected quantities .",
    "the data in most of our clusters extend to 1 to 2 200 , roughly consistent with the measured @xmath156 .",
    "a crucial step in the derivation of @xmath21 from cluster @xmath1 values is to correct for any differential luminosity evolution between the cluster and field galaxies .",
    "the luminosities of galaxies per unit total mass can , in principle , either increase or decrease depending on what happens when galaxies fall into a cluster .",
    "the empirical evidence is that once galaxies have spent some time in rich , high x - ray luminosity clusters like those in our sample , star formation largely ceases .",
    "however , there are at least two routes to this end point for a gas rich disk galaxy .",
    "galaxies entering the cluster could have their gas largely stripped away , or , a burst of star formation upon cluster entry could boost luminosity prior to depleting the gas . in either of these cases , lowering the star formation rate leads to a decrease in a galaxy s luminosity by an amount that depends on its entire star formation history .",
    "galaxy merging always decreases numbers , but can lead to luminosity increases if accompanied by star formation .",
    "all these possibilities are testable in one way or another , and some substantial constraints on differential evolution can be imposed using the data at hand .",
    "it is well known that the fraction of cluster galaxies with blue colors is a strongly increasing function of redshift , the butcher - oemler effect ( @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted that cluster galaxies are , on the average , never bluer than field galaxies , implying that , on the average , star formation always declines into a cluster .",
    "if the infall of field galaxies into clusters induces a temporary increase star formation and hence increases cluster galaxy luminosities relative to the field , then it should be apparent as a change in the color distribution ( and the strength of the [ oii ] lines ) .",
    "this is not seen in our data (  @xcite ) .",
    "on the basis of these considerations we expect that cluster galaxies are of intrinsically lower luminosities than the field galaxies .",
    "our sample of galaxies extends from the cluster center to the distant field , allowing population gradients to be examined as a function of a redshift space radial variable , @xmath184 .",
    "a convenient definition of such a variable is based on our normalized co - ordinates , where velocity differences are scaled to 1  and projected radial co - ordinates are scaled to 200 , so that the dimensionless redshift space separation from the center is @xmath185 , where @xmath40 is the projected radius from the center and @xmath186 is the rest - frame velocity difference from the average redshift .",
    "note that at large @xmath184 the galaxies come exclusively from the redshift direction .",
    "figure  [ fig : czr ] shows the color - radius relation of the full sample .",
    "all galaxies with k - corrected absolute @xmath8 magnitude , @xmath187 , brighter than @xmath188 mag are plotted .",
    "the colors are corrected to an empirically normalized redshift - independent color , @xmath189^{-1 } \\label{eq : gr}\\ ] ] ( @xcite ) .",
    "we note that there is no color gradient in the field , but one appears at @xmath190 , where we expect galaxies to enter the virialized region of the cluster .",
    "there is no evidence in the colors for excess star formation at the edge of the cluster ; indeed , there are no cluster galaxies systematically bluer than field galaxies . hence , the distribution of galaxy color with radius ( fig .",
    "[ fig : czr ] ) is consistent with infalling galaxies terminating their star formation with little or no `` starbursting '' once they enter the cluster , as detailed analysis of the cnoc data for a2390 has demonstrated ( @xcite ) .    a sample extending to a larger projected radius is needed to directly demonstrate kinematic evidence for infall of galaxies into the clusters .",
    "however , given the gravitational mass of the cluster , the turnaround radius is straightforwardly derived ( @xcite ) such that field galaxies must be falling into the cluster out to the turnaround radius , approximately @xmath191 for the model profile here . to a significant degree",
    "the cluster must be composed of former field galaxies .",
    "in such an infall scenario the cluster galaxies statistically share the star formation history of the field , prior to cluster entry .    the only gross difference between clusters and field",
    "is that clusters contain an unusual population of luminous central galaxies .",
    "the bcgs only make a difference at small @xmath184 , and generally contribute well less than 10% of the light . in spite of the substantial radial color gradient of figure  [ fig : czr ]",
    "there is very little change in the @xmath8 band luminosity distribution of figure  [ fig : lzr ] .",
    "measurements of the surface brightness evolution of both disks and bulges arrives at the conclusion that the amount of differential evolution between the field and the cluster luminosities is relatively small ( @xcite ) .",
    "there is no significant difference in the field galaxy luminosities or colors at any radius beyond @xmath6 , as shown in figure  [ fig : lzr ] .",
    "that is , the field galaxies near the cluster appear to be indistinguishable from those far away .",
    "a generic prediction of `` natural bias '' models of cluster galaxy formation is that the galaxies that eventually fall into the cluster should form earlier because the overdensity of the incipient cluster speeds up the local time scale relative to the mean universe .",
    "possibly this leads to a higher rate of conversion of gas to stars , causing cluster galaxies to be more luminous than their counterparts in the field .",
    "the color gradient appears at about @xmath6 , approximately where one expects cluster x - ray gas to be encountered .",
    "any fading or brightening of galaxies as they fall into the cluster can not be large . without the bcgs we measure a mean @xmath187 in the average cluster , @xmath192 , which is statistically identical to the field .",
    "however , this averages together blue and red galaxies , which contribute differently to the field and cluster , masking a real fading . splitting at @xmath193 ( eq .  [ eq : gr ] ) finds that both the blue and red galaxies show a decline in their mean brightness , above our limit , of @xmath194 mag ( @xmath195 for red , @xmath196 for blue ) between field and cluster . splitting the sample into a low and high redshift sample shows that the fading between red galaxies in cluster and field increases to about 0.2 mag at low redshift .",
    "a full luminosity function fit ( h.  lin , private communication ) finds a 0.2 mag field to cluster fading , but with large errors correlated with the faint end slope . in any case",
    "there is no evidence within these data for an excess in stellar luminosity per unit dark matter in cluster galaxies over field galaxies .",
    "the corrected @xmath8 band mass - to - light ratio in the field and these clusters does not vary much simply because there is so much `` old '' red light which is not altered during cluster infall .",
    "the @xmath26 estimate ( @xcite ) from cluster virial masses and the conversion of the cluster luminosity ( or numbers of galaxies ) to an equivalent co - moving volume in the field depends critically on the accuracy of the virial mass and the average luminosity of field and cluster being identical or having a measurable differential evolution .",
    "the expression for @xmath21 that we used as our best estimator is @xmath197 .",
    "the field luminosity was estimated to be @xmath198 where the errors were determined from a jacknife analysis .",
    "the value and random errors of @xmath199 were estimated as @xmath200 . from these results we concluded that the virial mass estimator gives @xmath36 .",
    "however , this result needs to be corrected for errors in @xmath0 relative to the field .",
    "we find that the virial mass needs to be multiplied by @xmath201 to give the shd mass at 200 .",
    "the correction is a consequence of measuring the virial mass from a truncated distribution and using data beyond 200 .",
    "the values of @xmath156 for @xmath202 are all within the errors of this value .",
    "we also find a significant mean luminosity differential between field and cluster which requires that the cluster luminosity be boosted by @xmath7 mag to give the field value .",
    "together these corrections reduce @xmath0 to a field @xmath203 and hence @xmath204 .",
    "the errors in the various quantities are given in table  [ tab : err ] , along with their quadrature and linear sum .",
    "the main errors in our result are simply the statistics of the luminosity density and the average cluster @xmath0 values .",
    "the systematic errors are estimated from the extreme versions of the analysis that we find for alternative @xmath114 values , choice of center , and color and redshift samples of the galaxies . to obtain an @xmath26 value accurate to about 10%",
    "would require a sample approximately four times larger .",
    "the total random error , 30% , is estimated from the quadrature sum of the individual errors",
    ". some of the component errors could be partially correlated which would increase the total error somewhat .",
    "the worst case possibility is if all the errors are completely correlated , in which case the error is the linear sum of the errors , 73% .",
    "this must be a substantial overestimate because many of the errors come from completely uncorrelated sources .",
    "the systematic errors in table  [ tab : err ] are harder to estimate .",
    "other choices of density centers and @xmath114 values give answers that allow error estimation for these parameter variations .",
    "the least satisfactory situation is the estimate of fading between cluster and field .",
    "our observations contain no evidence for excess star formation between cluster and field , so we feel that an increase in the average light can be ruled out .",
    "similarly , fading of much more than 0.5 mag in our @xmath8 band light would lead to such gross differences between cluster and field that it would be immediately visible .",
    "furthermore , for such a large fading to occur would likely require a stellar population weighted towards short lived luminous stars . to constrain further the differential luminosity evolution requires more detailed observations of the individual galaxies .",
    "the overall goal of the cnoc survey is to use clusters of galaxies to derive a value of @xmath26 with a well determined error budget with particular emphasis on eliminating systematic errors .",
    "the major innovations of our analysis are that it is completely self - contained , with most assumptions being testable , and that the error estimates are derived from the data themselves .",
    "the dominant source of error is random cluster - to - cluster variations due to projection and substructure , rather than the internal error from individual clusters .",
    "the global mass - to - light ratio ( in our photometric system ) of our sample clusters is constant within our typical errors of 20 - 30% at a value of @xmath200 . over the same redshift range we measure the closure value , @xmath34 to be @xmath205 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have shown that at 200  that the ratio of the dynamical mass to the cluster light , @xmath206 , with essentially no dependence on assumptions about velocity anisotropy . after allowing for the fading of cluster galaxies relative to the field , @xmath7 mag , and the bias in estimating @xmath11",
    ", we estimate that @xmath1 field is @xmath207 , implying @xmath204 .",
    "the objectively evaluated random errors and estimated systematic errors are given in table  [ tab : err ] .",
    "a strength of these data is that they cover the entire virialized cluster , extending out to where the overdensities are low , about @xmath208 , and hence reach to sufficiently large radii that the cluster @xmath1 should represent the @xmath1 of the infalling material .",
    "if segregation of dark matter mass and galaxies somehow occurs during infall , prior to to virialization in the cluster , then that could produce an artificially low @xmath1 .",
    "we find that the galaxy population outside the cluster has no measurable gradients .",
    "a benefit of this redshift range is that the galaxy populations in clusters more strongly resemble the field than they do at low redshift , tightening the @xmath1 argument .",
    "our @xmath26 estimate is similar to the least action principle result of @xmath209 ( @xcite ) which probes larger scales which have much smaller density contrast .",
    "our result is inconsistent with an @xmath26 of unity in any `` cold '' matter ( less than about 1000 ) that falls into clusters .",
    "furthermore the result is well below the @xmath210 interpretation of the large scale streaming velocity results ( @xcite ) . in particular",
    "our result in combination with the cosmic virial theorem estimates of @xmath211 ( @xcite ) implying that these galaxies are relatively unbiased mass tracers .",
    "because clusters assemble their mass from regions approximately 20  across , the difference between the streaming results and our determination is substantial .",
    "that is , there is little room for extra matter which supports density perturbations on larger scales but does not enter clusters over our range of observed redshifts .",
    "the @xmath26 we derive is a reasonably comfortable 3 standard deviations above the upper end of the fraction universe in baryons , @xmath212 , ( @xcite ) , as the x - ray mass measurements also indicate ( @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray analyses for the ratio of the x - ray gas mass , @xmath213 , to the total mass , @xmath214 , find @xmath215 ( approximately adjusted to @xmath216 , but see @xcite )",
    ". in combination with our results for @xmath26 this line of reasoning gives @xmath217 with an error of about 35% .",
    "consequently cluster baryons are consistent with other bbn indicators for @xmath218 , although with a fairly large error range .    the fact that the galaxy numbers and the cluster mass are distributed in an identical manner rules out any significant velocity bias between the cluster galaxies and the dark matter .",
    "that is , a small ( say 20% ) decrease in the velocity dispersion of cluster galaxies relative to the dark matter would lead to a substantial segregation of the cluster galaxies relative to the cluster mass ( @xcite ) .",
    "the conclusion to be drawn is that the galaxy tracers selected in @xmath27 n - body simulations do not form like the galaxies in the real universe .",
    "the implications of this are unclear .",
    "it is possible to identify relatively unbiased galaxy tracers in n - body simulations ( @xcite ) so the problem may be within the simulations .",
    "a more interesting possibility is that the understanding of galaxy formation and mass clustering that is incorporated into the simulations has some substantial deficiencies .",
    "there are several improvements in this analysis that could be made with more data , mainly at large radii .",
    "more data at large radii would reduce the variance resulting from substructure and sample all the clusters to similar 200 , diminishing the complications of the @xmath199 bias correction . with data extending beyond",
    "@xmath219 one enters the infall regime and expects to see the `` compression effect '' in the redshift space density contours of the ensemble cluster ( @xcite ) , which would empirically demonstrate that infall is occurring , and would give a measurement of @xmath220 in the nearly linear regime . with many more velocities in the cluster bodies",
