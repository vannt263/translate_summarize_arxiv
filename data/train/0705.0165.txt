    "observations of distant supernovae ( sne ) , galaxies , clusters of galaxies , and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) have shown that , surprisingly , the cosmic expansion is accelerating .",
    "this reveals that fundamentally new physics is missing from our understanding of the universe  @xcite .",
    "the cosmic acceleration may arise either from `` dark energy , '' a mysterious yet presently dominant component of the total energy density , or from `` modified gravity , '' a modification of general relativity ( gr ) on large scales .",
    "the first case includes , for example , einstein s cosmological constant or quintessence , a dynamical scalar field  @xcite .",
    "the second case includes modifications of four  dimensional gr due to the presence of extra dimensions , scalar ",
    "tensor theories , and others  @xcite .",
    "current efforts focus , within the dark energy paradigm , on improving the constraints on the dark energy density @xmath12 , its equation of state ( eos ) @xmath13 and its time evolution @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 is the scale factor ) , by using observational data that bear on geometrical distances and the growth of structure . as first emphasized by  @xcite and subsequently discussed by many others  @xcite",
    ", gr predicts a definite relation between geometrical distances and growth which is generically violated by modified theories of gravity . to the extent current data ( that are sensitive to different combinations of geometry and growth ) yield consistent dark energy constraints , one can interpret this as a confirmation of the dark energy + gr framework . the simplest dark energy model , the cosmological constant , has passed this kind of consistency test so far  @xcite .    in this paper , we sharpen the consistency test .",
    "our method goes by the name of `` parameter splitting '' as proposed by  @xcite .",
    "let us illustrate the technique using the cosmological constant ( @xmath16)cold dark matter ( cdm ) model . instead of fitting the suite of observational data with a single cosmological constant density parameter @xmath0 ( in addition to , of course , other non  dark energy parameters ) , we fit them with two parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    ": one determining the geometrical distances , and the other controlling the growth of structure .",
    "the conventional approach is to assume the two parameters are equal . here",
    ", they are allowed to vary separately .",
    "we employ the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) technique  @xcite to derive the marginalized constraints on both parameters .",
    "if the @xmath16cdm model is correct , these two parameters should agree within their uncertainties .",
    "this technique of splitting a conventional parameter into two `` meta  parameters '' can of course be applied to any other parameter . in this paper",
    ", we will consider the splitting of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that parameter splitting checks for consistency not only between different data sets , but also for internal consistency within any single data set that is sensitive to both geometry and growth . in some sense ,",
    "the conventional approach of obtaining constraints on , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath0 separately from sne , cmb , lensing and so on , and checking that they are consistent , is itself a simple form of parameter splitting , _",
    "i.e. _ , splitting @xmath0 into @xmath0(sne ) , @xmath0(cmb ) , @xmath0(lensing ) , etc .",
    "the parameter splitting that we employ here represents a more stringent , and theoretically better motivated , consistency test .",
    "it is also useful to note that there is a wide variety of modified gravity theories .",
    "our splitting of @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be thought of as a crude way to parametrize the space of such theories .",
    "for instance , in the dvali ",
    "gabadadze  porrati ( dgp ) theory  @xcite where gravity becomes weaker on large scales , structure growth is slowed and therefore one expects qualitatively @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "we caution that should an inconsistency be discovered via parameter splitting , modified gravity is not the only possible interpretation .",
    "systematic problems with the data , as well as complications in the dark energy model ( such as a time varying @xmath1 or nontrivial dark energy clustering  @xcite ) , are also possible .",
    "additional parameters need to be introduced to check for the latter case .",
    "parameter splitting can be applied to the new parameters as appropriate .",
    "all geometrical distances in cosmology , such as the luminosity or angular diameter distance , are related to the radial comoving distance ( z ) = ^z_0 , [ eq : chi ] setting the speed of light @xmath19 .",
    "the hubble parameter @xmath20 as a function of redshift @xmath21 , _ i.e. _ , the expansion history , can be parametrized as follows : = _ m ( 1+z)^3 + _ r ( 1+z)^4 + _ de ( 1+z)^3(1+w ) , [ eq : hist ] where @xmath22 km s@xmath23mpc@xmath23 is the hubble constant today . throughout this paper , we assume that the universe is spatially flat , the dark energy has a constant eos parameter @xmath1 and all three species of neutrinos are massless .",
    "@xmath24 is the radiation density today , in units of the critical density , including photons and massless neutrinos ; @xmath12 is the present dark energy density , denoted as @xmath0 for the cosmological constant model ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "note that for a flat universe , the dimensionless matter density @xmath26 can be replaced by @xmath27 .",
    "we will use a superscript `` ( geom ) '' to denote the dark energy parameters appearing in the expressions of geometrical distances .",
    "inhomogeneities grow under gravitational instability according to the prevailing structure formation paradigm .",
    "the dynamics within the gr framework is described by a set of boltzmann ",
    "einstein equations well documented in the literature  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use the publicly available code _ camb _  @xcite to evolve these equations . for the purpose of illustrating our method , and",
    "purely for this purpose , let us consider the special case of subhorizon matter fluctuations in the late universe .",
    "they evolve according to @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the matter overdensity , @xmath30 is the average matter density , @xmath31 is the newton constant and the dots denote proper time derivatives .",
    "we ignore the dark energy perturbations here for simplicity .",
    "the growth equation can be rewritten as + = _ m , [ eq : grow ] where @xmath32 is the scale factor .",
    "therefore , the expansion history [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : hist ] ) ] that determines geometrical distances also determines the growth of structure , in a way that is uniquely predicted by gr .",
    "it is not surprising that , in order to match existing data , viable theories of modified gravity often predict an expansion history ( and therefore geometrical distances ) that is similar to the one in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hist ] ) .",
    "such theories , however , generally predict a relation between expansion history and growth that is different from the one in eq .",
    "( [ eq : grow ] ) .",
    "given the wide variety of these theories , and in the absence of a particularly compelling candidate  @xcite , a crude way to test for such a possibility is to allow the dark energy parameters to take different values in the growth equation [ eq .  (",
    "[ eq : grow ] ) ] from their values in the expression for distance [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi ] ) ] , _ i.e. _ , parameter splitting .",
    "we use a superscript `` ( grow ) '' to denote the dark energy parameters characterizing the evolution of inhomogeneities .",
    "note that one has some freedom in exactly how the parameter splitting is performed .",
    "for instance , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : grow ] ) , the dark energy parameters show up in two places : the second term on the left hand side of the equation ( @xmath33 ) and the term on the right hand side ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "one could choose to assign all of them to the `` growth '' category which is what we do , or one could assign some to the `` geometry '' category and the others to the `` growth '' category .",
    "ultimately , there are many possible consistency tests , and here we have chosen to perform one that is particularly simple to implement , _",
    "i.e. _ , assigning all dark energy parameters that enter the fluctuation equations to the `` growth '' category .",
    "it is worth noting that in a lot of modified gravity theories , the equivalent of the poisson s equation is often modified without modifying energy ",
    "momentum conservation . in that case",
    ", one could argue assigning the term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : grow ] ) alone to the `` growth '' category might make more sense .",
    "we hope to investigate this in the future .",
    "the exact boltzmann ",
    "einstein equations for the evolution of structure , allowing for multiple components , photons , neutrinos and so on , are more complicated than eq .",
    "( [ eq : grow ] ) .",
    "the same parameter ",
    "splitting scheme can nevertheless be applied to the exact equations , which is what we do .",
    "this means , for example , the shape of the transfer function , such as the radiation ",
    "matter equality peak of the power spectrum , is determined by the growth parameters  recall that the transfer function is completely determined by the dynamics of fluctuation growth .",
    "the conversion of a feature , such as the radiation ",
    "matter equality length scale to an observed angle , on the other hand , involves the geometry parameters .",
    "to illustrate how the splitting of dark energy parameters into the `` geometry '' and `` growth '' categories is done in our analysis , we start with the weak lensing ( wl ) observables",
    ". there exists a natural division between the two categories for each term involved in the calculation  @xcite .",

    "the three  dimensional matter power spectrum @xmath42 and the mean matter density @xmath26 ( @xmath43 , where the contribution of radiation is neglected at low redshifts ) sitting outside the integral both describe the foreground inhomogeneities through which photons travel .",
    "therefore they go into the `` growth '' category and are calculated using @xmath44 . all @xmath45 s within the integral fall naturally in the `` geometry '' category .",
    "this includes the @xmath45 in the wavenumber @xmath46 , which reflects the conversion between the observed angle and the physical length scale .",
    "these geometrical distances are all calculated using @xmath47 .",
    "a similar split can be applied to @xmath1 in the context of the quintessence ( q)cdm model .    with the wl example in mind",
    ", we next consider the cmb .",
    "the temperature anisotropy power spectrum is given by c^tt_= k^2 dk  p_(k ) ||^2 , where @xmath48 is the primordial metric perturbation ( in conformal newtonian gauge ) , @xmath49 is the power spectrum of @xmath50 , and @xmath51 is given by  @xcite _ ( k , z=0 ) = _",
    "0^dz  _ t(k , z ) j_. [ eq : cmb ] where @xmath52 is the spherical bessel function and @xmath53 denotes some source function .",

    "we perform the geometry  growth split of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cmb ] ) as follows  @xcite : @xmath53 falls under the `` growth '' category and the rest ( namely @xmath55 in the argument of @xmath52 ) falls under the `` geometry '' category  @xcite .",

    "@xmath58 is the dirac delta function with @xmath59 being the redshift of last scattering , and @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the temperature monopole and metric perturbations at last scattering .",
    "therefore , the sachs ",

    "it is straightforward to generalize the above splitting scheme to similar expressions describing the polarization spectrum . in the case of sne ,",
    "parameter splitting is trivial since sne constrain only the geometry parameters .",
    "the splitting for galaxy clustering is done as follows . as discussed earlier , the growth ( as opposed to geometry ) parameters determine the transfer function for the matter power spectrum . on the other hand , to measure the three  dimensional power spectrum of galaxies as a function of comoving spatial scale , one has to adopt a cosmological model in order to convert the observed redshifts and angular separations into comoving distances .",
    "this conversion is trivial for low  redshift surveys ( involving only @xmath64 ) such as the two  degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) , but is nontrivial for moderate redshift samples , such as the luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . for the lrgs",

    "the extension of the likelihood contours in the large negative direction of @xmath88 reflects the fact that a very recent dark energy domination is actually acceptable as far as the growth of structure is concerned .",
    "this does not imply the data is consistent with the absence of dark energy , however . on the contrary ,",

    "[ fig : qcdm ] , lies beyond the @xmath11 contour for constraints from all the data sets ; varying @xmath26 in the dgp model within its @xmath11 limits has little effect on the position of the point .",
