    "currently there is an heightened interest in geometric and topological properties of _ open _ quantum systems where finite temperature , dissipation , and non - equilibrium transport play a key role . for closed",
    "quantum systems topological properties are generally appreciated for their robustness against perturbations , assuming these perturbations keep the system closed .",
    "this robustness , for example , underlies the successful topological classification of phases of closed quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "it is a pressing question how this scheme is affected when one opens up the system , allowing for finite temperature , dissipation , and nonequilibrium  @xcite . to address this issue recently topological numbers for dissipative systems",
    "have been discussed  @xcite starting from the uhlmann connection for _ mixed _ quantum states  @xcite .",
    "one may also utilize topological robustness for _ controlling _ quantum systems .",
    "for example , in the area of quantum information processing this is exploited in geometric quantum computing  @xcite and in topological error correction  @xcite .",
    "ultimately , topological properties stand in the foreground because of their superior robustness as compared to geometric properties .",
    "however , as for classical mechanics  , also for quantum systems a deep understanding of the underlying _ geometric _ properties is always a prerequisite for such control .",
    "one of the reasons why the geometric properties of open quantum systems are more complex than for closed systems is that they are described by mixed states rather than pure states  .",
    "however , as this paper will emphasize , this is not the only important difference .",
    "there are also important geometric properties associated with",
    "_ observables _",
    "@xcite , including _ nonsystem _",
    "observables  @xcite defined ( partly ) on the system s environment and their transport currents .    indeed ,",
    "geometric effects appear naturally in open quantum systems when considering _ pumping _ , which has been studied extensively in electronic systems . in the long - time limit the transport through a mesoscopic system exhibits steady - state pumping when its external parameters are periodically modulated in time  @xcite .",
    "for example , in highly - tuneable mesoscopic quantum - dot systems one can drive local system properties via electrical gates , modulate the coupling to external reservoirs@xcite by tunnel barriers , or vary the external electro - chemical potentials  @xcite or temperatures  @xcite .",
    "such time - dependent control has been experimentally demonstrated even for atomic - scale junctions  @xcite and is also of interest for realizing molecular motors  @xcite .    when slowly driving an open quantum system there are two effects to consider .",
    "first , one generically obtains a nonequilibrium current at every instant in time if there is an instantaneous ( possibly time - dependent ) bias applied , either electrochemical or thermal or both .",
    "this survives even in the adiabatic limit of vanishing driving frequency @xmath0 .",
    "the net transported after one cycle then generically contains an average over these instantaneous currents ( `` sum of snapshots '' ) .",
    "since this part of the current is invariant under inversion of the parameter driving , its effect can always be canceled out experimentally or extracted theoretically .",
    "however , there is also the _ pumping _ contribution which _ only _ derives from this time - dependent driving  @xcite .",
    "physically , this contribution clearly differs from the instantaneous one : it arises because the state of the open system can not instantaneously follow the driving but lags behind .",
    "it derives from the time - average of the nonadiabatic part of the current that is linear in driving frequency @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , this pumping effect is often referred to as `` adiabatic pumping ''  @xcite which we will emphatically avoid here . in this paper",
    "we focus on this _ adiabatic - response pumping _ in open quantum systems which has the hallmark of a _ geometric _ quantity@xcite in its simplest meaning : it depends on the driving parameter curve alone and not on the driving frequency , in contrast to the nongeometric , instantaneous part of the transported charge per cycle . pumping thus arises as an adiabatic - response to driving@xcite ( `` lag '' ) and is inherently a ( first - order ) _ _ non__adiabatic geometric effect , in contrast to the more commonly considered geometric phases associated with adiabatic dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the interest in the geometric nature of pumping also lies in robust control of transport of quantities like charge , spin , or energy .",
    "for example , for applications to charge - current standards@xcite the robustness of the geometric pumping with respect to frequency - fluctuations is relevant .",
    "therefore , it is of practical importance to be able to separate clearly this frequency independent adiabatic - response pumped observable responsible for `` clocked '' electron transfer  @xcite from the driving - frequency dependent nongeometric adiabatic contribution .",
    "this paper shows that a separate consideration of the adiabatic - response part is also of theoretical importance for identifying the physical origin of the gauge freedom underlying pumping .",
    "further motivation is provided by the interest in _ topological _ pumping mentioned at the beginning : namely , topological pumping arises when geometric quantities depend only on the `` type '' of the driving cycle ( homotopy class ) .",
    "for example , one characteristic is the number of windings of the parameter cycle around a `` hole '' in parameter space ( similar to the aharonov - bohm effect ) . as long as this characteristic stays unchanged",
    ", the pumped quantity is even protected against continuous deformations of the geometric properties of the driving cycle .    in this work",
    "we are particularly interested in identifying the geometric nature of the pumping contribution in systems where _ strong interactions _",
    "play a role .",
    "this is largely motivated by experiments on quantum dot systems   in which one can exploit strong coulomb interactions to gain control over a _",
    "single _ electron as already shown in early experiments on pumping  @xcite .",
    "more recently , accurately clocked sources of single charges  @xcite or spins  @xcite have been implemented .",
    "this illustrates the high degree of control over single electrons in a quantum - dot system _ in time_.    the last point of interest going beyond the aspects of robustness and control is the use of pumping as a _",
    "`` spectroscopic '' _ tool . in this paper",
    "we discuss how pumping effects can shed light on properties of an open quantum system that remain hidden when considering only non - driven , stationary transport .",
    "this has use as an experimental tool , since one can infer , for example , the tunnel - coupling asymmetry and the spin - degeneracy of a quantum dot just by using the qualitative features of an _ interaction - induced _ charge pumping  @xcite effect .",
    "however , it may also function as a theoretical tool similar to the usual linear - response to a perturbation : in models that are theoretically hard to analyze , physical characteristics that are not revealed by stationary properties ( e.g. , due to renormalization effects ) may well appear in an adiabatic - response calculation of pumping effects  @xcite .",

    "for open systems _ without _ interactions ( beyond the mean - field level ) , brouwer s generalization of the bttiker - thomas - prtre scattering theory for time - dependent setups provides a now standard framework  @xcite for pumping . within this approach , the geometric nature of charge pumping",
    "is associated with unitary transformations of the scattering matrices  @xcite .",
    "this has played an important role , for example , in recent theoretical work on current - induced forces in nanoscale systems  @xcite and nanoscale motors  @xcite .",

    "this is a primary topic of the present paper .",
    "several geometric frameworks have been formulated based on the reduced density operator , including contexts unrelated to pumping .",
    "we will tie together three of these formulations , found in , and , and , , , respectively . here , we outline these three geometric approaches , taking note of many other density - operator based works  .",
    "\\(i ) _ adiabatic state - evolution ( ) approach . _",
    "a perhaps intuitive , but wrong expectation is that the geometric nature of pumping in open systems arises from the dynamics of the quantum state .",
    "however , in the following it is still important to consider such geometric phases .",
    "the geometric nature of this adiabatic _ mixed - state _ evolution has been worked out by sarandy and lidar@xcite .",
    "this closely follows the analogy to the adiabatic berry - simon phase for adiabatic evolution of a pure state of a closed quantum system . in the approach the mixed - state density operator @xmath4 is considered as a ket vector @xmath5 in liouville ( or hilbert - schmidt ) space evolving according to a time - local master equation @xmath6 here , the kernel @xmath7 takes over the role of the evolution generator played by the hamiltonian @xmath8 in the berry - simon case based on the schrdinger equation @xmath9 .",
    "the time dependence enters entirely through the instantaneous values of the driving parameters @xmath10 .",
    "another similarity between these approaches is that in both cases the gauge freedom consists of multiplying the nondegenerate eigenvectors of @xmath11 by a number .",
    "in contrast to the berry - simon case , these are nonzero complex numbers ( nonunitary , noncompact gauge group ) , rather than phase factors ( unitary , compact ) .",
    "the solution of the master equation for slow driving follows the instantaneous eigenvectors of @xmath11 and after a driving period @xmath12 exhibits a jump in these numbers resulting in @xmath13 .",
    "this discontinuity derives from complex - valued jumps each given by an open - system analog of the unitary berry - simon geometric phase factor .",
    "several points discussed in this paper can be understood as a formal application of this generalization of the berry - simon phase .",
    "however , the approach does not deal with _ steady - state _ pumping and the ase phase essentially differs from the simple geometric pumping phase that we work out here : in our contexts the former is identically zero , even when accounting for the first nonadiabatic correction ( adiabatic - response ) to the state .",
    "this quenching of the berry - simon type phase forms the starting point for the considerations of geometric steady - state pumping .",
    "\\(ii ) _ full - counting statistics ( ) approach to pumping . _ within the density operator framework the geometric nature of _ pumping _ of observables was first clarified when sinitsyn and nemenmann@xcite applied the well - established fcs approach to pumping ( `` stochastic pumping '' ) as introduced in more detail in . in the one",
    "uses a generating function depending on a `` counting field '' variable @xmath2 to obtain the statistics for all moments of a selected observable and its dynamics .",
    "this generating function is obtained from a `` generating operator '' @xmath14 , which is the `` adiabatic '' solution of a master - type equation similar to and exhibits a geometric phase .",
    "this elegant and powerful approach has been applied to various pumping problems and is reviewed in : applications range from molecular reactions  @xcite , to heat transport through strongly anharmonic molecules  @xcite , and strongly interacting quantum dots  @xcite .",
    "it was also used to demonstrate that thermodynamic _",
    "vector _ potentials arise in slow but nonadiabatic transformations between non - equilibrium steady - states  @xcite accounting for _ geometric _ heat and excess entropy production .    in a recent paper  @xcite , nakajima et al . addressed a possible point of confusion in the approach",
    ": how can an `` adiabatic '' approach include physically nonadiabatic pumping ? in the last part of the present paper we will further clarify this issue by extending the observations made in along a different route . especially , we focus on the question what the conditions for `` adiabaticity '' are .",
    "the approach put forward in the main part of our paper emphasizes that pumping is physically speaking nonadiabatic , i.e. , it is a result of the retarded response of the current through the driven system ( `` lag '' ) .",
    "importantly , we show how _ within _ this physical nonadiabatic picture of pumping its geometric nature can be fully understood independent of the formulation thereby avoiding the `` adiabaticity '' issue mentioned above .",
    "our detailed comparison sheds further light on several important aspects of the approach that are of general interest .",
    "\\(iii ) _ adiabatic - response ( ) approach .",
    "_ finally , avron et al . studied  @xcite pumping in the density operator approach also starting from .",
    "interestingly , they considered pumping for both unique and nonunique frozen - parameter stationary states .",
    "however , they restricted their analysis to pumping of _ system _ observables ( i.e. , with current operators related to particle transfer between parts _ within _ the open subsystem ) and considered only a single reservoir . in the present paper we study _ nonsystem _ observables and their currents to _ multiple _ reservoirs , which is crucial for describing the transport _ through _ an open quantum system that enables a geometric spectroscopy .",
    "also , our approach works if there are no conservation laws , which is relevant , e.g. , for spin - transport . for a unique stationary state ,",
    "adiabatic - response pumping of system - observables was calculated in , relating to berry - robbins `` geometric magnetism ''  @xcite .    of these three approaches",
    "the approach is of special importance for our work .",
    "the present paper was inspired by a discussion in of the nonuniqueness of currents in relation to their observables , reaching back to earlier works  @xcite .",
    "following up on an earlier remark in ( p. 8)",
    "we combine this idea with landsberg s approach  @xcite [ cf . also ] to dissipative systems with symmetry .",
    "the key point is the consideration of the physical role of the meter registering the pumping signal .",
    "this results in an intuitive and clear physical picture that does not seem to have been worked out so far . however , the other two approaches are also relevant ( cf . ) and are actively used in the present paper . the approach and approach we show to be exactly equivalent for the first moment@xcite and both fit into the framework of the approach .",
    "_ adiabatic - response approach based on real - time kernels .",
    "_ the three mentioned approaches are all based on a master equation of the simple type .",
    "having in mind an extension  @xcite of our results beyond the scope of the approaches outlined above , the present paper builds upon a more general density - operator framework which we now briefly outline . for pumping in",
    "slowly driven open systems an adiabatic - response approach was developed  @xcite , based on the exact time - nonlocal kinetic equation for the density operator , @xmath15     + \\int_{-\\infty}^t dt ' w(t , t ' ; \\{\\vec{r}(\\tau)\\ } ) \\rho(t ' )    ,    \\label{eq : kineq - general}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here written for the time - dependent steady - state limit , i.e. , switching on the system - reservoir coupling at @xmath16 and starting from an initially factorizing system - reservoir state .",
    "this approach to pumping is close in spirit to the approaches mentioned above under ( iii ) .",
    "however , it goes beyond these by incorporating the fact that the open - system evolution has a _ functional _ dependence on the entire driving - parameter history , indicated by the dependence on @xmath17 of the kernel @xmath11 .",
    "this is accomplished by systematically accounting for processes of higher order in the coupling as well as the laplace - frequency dependence of both the kernel and the density operator . from this point of view , the superoperator @xmath11 in only accounts for the zero - frequency ( @xmath18 ) part of the laplace - transform of @xmath19 of the kernel in after freezing its parameters at the latest time @xmath20 .",
    "expectation values of nonsystem observables @xmath21 e.g .",
    "reservoir observables or reservoir - system currents are described by a similar time - nonlocal equation : @xmath22 with an _ observable - specific memory - kernel _",
    "@xmath23 that in general needs to be calculated separately in addition to @xmath11 in .",
    "a key point of the paper is that this equation requires careful consideration in order to ensure explicit physical gauge covariance of the formalism .    for strongly interacting open systems",
    "the real - time diagrammatic technique provides a general framework  @xcite for calculating the time - nonlocal kernels that are required in - but also those required for noise  @xcite , correlation functions  @xcite , and   for the full counting statistics  @xcite .",
    "the flexibility of this approach is illustrated by the possibility of formulating a nonequilibrium renormalization group scheme for calculating @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "for example , this enabled a nonperturbative adiabatic - response analysis  @xcite of interaction effects on the universal charge - relaxation resistance  @xcite for strong tunnel coupling and low temperature .",
    "however , in this more general setting so far little attention has been paid to the geometric aspects of pumping .",
    "we address two questions questions relevant to this : first , where in the formalism does the gauge freedom responsible for geometric pumping arise ?",
    "what is its concrete physical meaning ?",
    "second , the general approach to pumping is based on real - time memory - kernels for nonsystem _ observables _ [ ] .",
    "the role of these kernels for the geometric nature of pumping has not been considered at all within the other formulations outlined under ( iii ) above . what is this role ?    as we will show , these questions are intimately related and will lead to the insight that _ observables _ , rather than mixed quantum states , accumulate a geometric phase that is responsible for steady - state pumping . to see this ,",
    "it is necessary but not sufficient to account for generically _ time - dependent _ observables , even when interested in the expectation values of _ time - constant _ ones .",
    "this is the fundamental difference to the approaches listed under ( iii ) and turns out to provide the link to the approach ( ii ) .",
    "fortunately , this can already be addressed in the much simpler setting of instead of the general density - operator approach based on . in this paper",
    "we thus start from essentially the same kind of master equation as the approaches ( i)-(iii ) reviewed above .      in summary ,",
    "our aim is to set up a geometric framework for pumping through strongly interacting open systems that can deal with nonsystem observables , that is more direct than the approach ( when targeting only the first moment ) , and that is a more suitable starting point for generalization to evolutions more complicated than .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows :    in we review how the kernels for the evolution of the state [ ] and for the observable expectation values can be derived .",
    "we pay attention to issues related to inadverted gauge - fixing by the common procedure of normal - ordering expressions with respect to the reservoirs .",
    "the key formula is the heisenberg equation for the current superoperator _",
    "after _ the reservoirs have been integrated out . at the end of this section",
    "we formulate the guiding questions for the remainder of the paper .    in we",
    "then show that in the setting of pumping a gauge freedom emerges that is related to the physical calibration of the meter registering the transport of a nonsystem observable ( reservoir charge , spin , heat , etc . ) .",
    "the pumping problem precisely fits into the general geometric framework of landsberg  @xcite for driven dissipative systems with a continuous ( gauge ) symmetry .",
    "the solution determines a geometric connection ( gauge potential ) on a simple fiber bundle of _ observables _ over the manifold of driving parameters .",
    "this connection is essentially the nonadiabatic current response and is closely related to a meter calibration .    in",
    "we analyze the expression for the corresponding geometric curvature ( gauge field ) essentially the measurable pumped observable and determine necessary conditions for a nonzero pumping effect .",
    "we explain how under quite general circumstances pumping can be used to perform a _ geometric spectroscopy _ of a weakly coupled open system .",
    "finally , in the extensive we compare the landsberg - approach in detail with the approach , when applied only to the first moment of the pumped . despite the quite different formulation , we show that this approach is equivalent to the simpler and more direct landsberg - approach on all levels : gauge freedom , connection ( gauge potential ) , geometric pumping formula for the curvature ( gauge field ) , as well as the limits of applicability .",
    "our formulation highlights the physical role of the meter and allows us to further clarify the puzzling fact noted in   that the `` adiabatic '' approach produces _ _",
    "non__adiabatic contributions .",
    "the adiabatic - response approach to pumping that we describe in this section and whose geometric content we identify in applies to very general open quantum systems .",
    "we consider a quantum system with discrete energy spectrum coupled to multiple noninteracting reservoirs indexed by @xmath24 .",
    "whereas the reservoirs are assumed to be made up of either fermions or bosons , the system can be of mixed type as well .",
    "we allow for possibly strong nonequilibrium conditions due to nonlinear biasing of the reservoirselectrochemical potentials ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "of central importance is that our findings also apply to a quantum system that is locally strongly interacting , in contrast to several existing pumping approaches  @xcite .",
    "for example , coulomb interaction is crucial if one wants to describe driven transport through quantum - dot devices , such as semi - conductor heterostructures  @xcite , but also molecules  @xcite and single atoms  @xcite",
    ". however , the approach applies equally well to bosonic models of pumping in chemical reactions between strongly interacting molecules  @xcite and heat pumping using anharmonic  @xcite molecules .",
    "the total system has the generic form of the hamiltonian @xmath26 with @xmath27 describing the system .",
    "@xmath28 accounts for the reservoirs including a driving term @xmath29 for each reservoir @xmath24 . finally , @xmath30 is the coupling of the system to multiple reservoirs where @xmath31 describes the particle and energy exchange with reservoir @xmath24 .",
    "we denote the energy scale of the coupling by @xmath32 , having in mind that for quantum - dot pumps this corresponds to the tunnel rate of particles . in this case",
    ", @xmath33 is the scale of the electron lifetime on the quantum dot . to achieve pumping , we allow that all hamiltonians in are driven time - dependently through a set of parameters .",
    "for example , for a quantum dot coupled to metallic electrodes , this means that besides the reservoir electrochemical potentials and couplings , any of the dot s parameters can be driven through applied voltages : the single - particle energy levels , but also the two - particle interaction  , etc .    at the initial time where the driving and the coupling to the reservoirs are switched on the initial equilibrium density operator of all reservoirs @xmath34 ,",
    "is :    @xmath35    [ eq : rhores ]    it is characterized by the constant temperatures @xmath36 , the electrochemical@xcite potentials @xmath37 and the initial hamiltonians @xmath38 without driving . in the following",
    "we will use the form in which we eliminated the undriven @xmath38 in favor of the driven hamiltonian governing the dynamics , @xmath39 , by introducing a ( cancelling ) time - dependence through driven electrochemical potentials @xmath40 . the theory below",
    "can then be expressed entirely in terms of these _ parametrically _ time - dependent quantities is actually advantageous . ] .",
    "we gather all driving parameters in one dimensionless vector @xmath10 , i.e. , each parameter is taken relative to a relevant scale .",
    "for example , in driven quantum dots , @xmath10 would include the applied voltages divided by temperature , see the explicit example in [ ] .",
    "this ensures that @xmath41 has unit energy setting @xmath42 [ ] and that later on the pumping curvature [ ] has the direct physical meaning of pumped per unit area of the driving parameter space .",
    "the parameters are cyclically driven in time at the frequency @xmath0 .",
    "we denote the period by @xmath43 and the traversed oriented closed curve in the parameter space by @xmath44 .",

    "like the adiabatic phase in @xmath676 , also this relative geometric phase is quenched when we take the steady - state limit : in the rotating frame @xmath686 also remains trace - normalized : @xmath687 in the second line we have used that @xmath688 is a left eigenvector of @xmath689 to eigenvalue zero and therefore @xmath690 .",
    "hence we know that @xmath691 is a left eigenvector of @xmath692 to eigenvalue zero .",
    "thus , the continuity is enforced by probability normalization , even when including the adiabatic - response , @xmath693 .",
    "clearly , we can continue this argument to find , that in each iteration step @xmath497 this is a left eigenvector of the corresponding generator @xmath694 .",
    "one then finds that the geometric and dynamic phases @xmath695 and @xmath696 , which remain in the steady - state limit , are zero assuming the steady state at each iteration to be unique : for the dynamical term this results trivially from the zero - eigenvalue @xmath697 . for the geometric part this follows from the biorthonormality of @xmath698 for all @xmath195 with @xmath195-independent @xmath699 :    @xmath700    thus the geometric phase relative to the previous iteration is quenched and we can say that the nonadiabatic steady - state density operator `` exhibits no geometric phase '' .",
    "hence , a unique mixed steady - state will always return to itself after one driving period , i.e. , it is continuous in the parameters [ ] .",
    "_ reduction to the steady state .",
    "_ finally , we now show explicitly that to order @xmath701 the steady - state solution after one iteration coincides with the result of the more practical _ sum _ expansion of the approach in the main text .",

    "correction to the dynamics _ also _ corresponds to a geometric phase in the quantum state , the first - iteration phase @xmath710 , which is however zero in the steady state on general grounds .",
    "this is the starting point for landsberg s phase to emerge from the observable .",
    "in this section we illustrate the relation of the kernel @xmath314 to the time - evolution kernel @xmath11 , , and to the observable current kernel @xmath244 , .",
    "in particular , we show that the redundant @xmath358 [ ] , which obscures the relation of the @xmath2-linear part to the current kernels , is nonzero even in a simple application .    the explicit kernel for the generating operator is taken from taken from [ eq . ( 68 ) and eq .",
