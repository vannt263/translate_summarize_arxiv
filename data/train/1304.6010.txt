    "the oscillation amplitude increases linearly with temperature due to hooke s regime for the atomic vibrations leading to a linear increase of the lindemann index with t. at higher temperature , the * anharmonic vibrations * ( non - linear effects ) become important and the lindemann index exhibits a nonlinear dependence on t. the particle oscillation amplitude increases faster than linear with t , but the system does not melt yet , since the arrangement of atoms have still some ordered structure , i.e. solid - liquid coexistence state . for small nano - clusters",
    "the latter is related to not well defined small three dimensional structures . in general , melting occurs when the lindemann index increases very sharply with t over a small t - range . in this study",
    "we will assume that the melting point is around the sharp jump in @xmath8 , i.e. when the system becomes almost a random coil .",
    "we will show that the lindemann index * adequately indicates the structural * deformation ( melting - like transition ) of carbon nano - clusters .",
    "the obtained linear regime in @xmath8 is smoother than some of the previous studies  @xcite for small nano - clusters .",
    "therefore , we will not only use the critical value of @xmath8 to determine the melting point but we will also pay particular attention to the temperature dependence of the lindemann index when identifying the melting temperature .",
    "in addition to the lindmann index , the total energy ( caloric curve ) and specific heat variation versus t are two common quantities which can be used to determine the phase transition .",
