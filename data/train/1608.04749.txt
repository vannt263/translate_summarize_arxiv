    "scalar and vector mesons are intimately connected .",
    "the vector ward - green - takahashi ( wgt ) identity , typically associated with electromagnetic current conservation , ensures that , in the presence of a nonzero difference between the current - masses of a given channel s two valence - quarks @xmath3 , a scalar vertex , including all its associated poles ( scalar mesons ) , is indistinguishable from the longitudinal projection of the related vector vertex .",
    "consequently , notwithstanding the potential complications @xcite , even light scalar mesons should contain a measurable component with standard mesonic character , _ i.e_.  generated by a leading - twist quark - antiquark interpolating field @xcite .    in the rest frame ,",
    "the quark - antiquark component of light - quark scalar mesons is predominantly @xmath4-wave in character @xcite .",
    "although this conclusion conflicts with notions derived from quantum mechanical two - body models , which describe scalar mesons as @xmath5 states , it should not be surprising because : the class of contact - interaction theories generate a @xmath6-meson as the chiral partner of the pion @xcite , also an @xmath4-wave state ; and a vector@xmath7vector contact - interaction produces bethe - salpeter amplitudes that are independent of @xmath8-@xmath9 relative momentum @xcite , in which case orbital angular momentum within the bound - state is greatly suppressed .",
    "on the other hand , a @xmath0-wave component in the scalar meson grows with increasing current - quark mass , so that the quark - model description of scalar mesons is valid for @xmath10 . analogously , light - quark vector - mesons contain both @xmath4- and @xmath11-wave components of commensurate size , but the @xmath11-wave component diminishes with increasing current - quark mass , so that these states may be described as @xmath12 systems in the heavy - heavy limit @xcite .",
    "consequently , a given scalar meson may be understood as a @xmath13 orbital excitation of a related vector meson when @xmath10 .",
    "there is at least one significant difference between scalar and vector mesons , however .",
    "namely , when @xmath14 , vector mesons possess two nonzero decay constants , one of which describes the bound - state s leptonic decay , but the analogous scalar - meson decay constant is identically zero : @xmath15 .",
    "this follows from the wgt identity and is simply the statement that a @xmath16 current can not connect a @xmath17 bound - state to the @xmath17 vacuum .",
    "these observations translate into the result that whilst the two leading - twist vector - meson parton distribution amplitudes ( pdas ) possess a nonzero leading mellin moment at any finite renormalisation scale , this moment vanishes for all scalar mesons whose valence degrees - of - freedom satisfy @xmath14 , irrespective of the size of the common current - mass , large or small .",
    "this feature must entail considerable differences between the leading - twist pdas of scalar and vector mesons .    amongst other things ,",
    "leading - twist meson pdas play an important role in the analysis and understanding of hard exclusive processes , such as pseudoscalar meson electromagnetic form factors @xcite and diffractive vector - meson production @xcite , and also in the study of @xmath18-violation via nonleptonic decays of heavy - light mesons @xcite .",
    "additionally , they provide deep insights into the structure of hadron bound - states , revealing , _",
    "e.g_.  how mass is distributed @xcite and momentum is shared amongst an hadron s constituents .",
    "substantial value is therefore attached to their computation in frameworks with a traceable connection to qcd .",
    "using qcd s dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) @xcite , low - twist pdas of pseudoscalar- and vector - meson ground - states and pseudoscalar - meson radial - excitations have recently been computed @xcite ; and , where a meaningful comparison is possible , the results agree with those determined via numerical simulations of lattice - regularised qcd @xcite . hence , given the features highlighted above , we consider it interesting to use this approach to compute the leading - twist pdas of scalar - meson ground - states and radial excitations , and the radial excitations of vector mesons , all constituted from light quarks .",
    "the complete body of results thus obtained should prove useful in both developing novel insights into hadron structure and constraining phenomenological applications of hard scattering formulae in a wide variety of processes .",
    "we provide the background for our calculations in sec.[secscalars ] , including details of the gap and bethe - salpeter interaction kernels , and a description of the manner by which we recover pdas from their mellin moments .",
    "this leads naturally to the presentation and discussion of results for the pdas of a range of @xmath19 quark - antiquark systems .",
    "the same methods are employed in sec.[secvectors ] to analyse the pdas of radially - excited light - quark vector mesons .",
    "we summarise and outline some future prospects in sec.[epilogue ] .",
    "all scalar mesons that possess nonzero overlap with the interpolating field @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a @xmath22 identity matrix acting on spinor indices , appear as poles in the bethe - salpeter equation whose inhomogeneity is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a matrix specifying the flavour structure of the system . denoting the total momentum flowing into the scalar vertex by @xmath0 , a pole at @xmath25 need not lie on the real-@xmath26 axis . ; @xmath27 ; @xmath28 , tr@xmath29=-4 \\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}$ ] ; @xmath30 $ ] ; @xmath31 ; and @xmath32 timelike @xmath33 @xmath34 . ]",

    "pseudoscalar- and vector - mesons are considered to be @xmath4-wave states in the two - body quark model . when @xmath81 , the pda peaks at zero relative momentum , so eq . can be seen to indicate that the valence - constituents of a @xmath17 bound - state possess a maximal amount of relative light - front momentum .",
    "it is now a small step to appreciate that small light - front relative momentum ensures minimal light - front angular momentum , hinting at @xmath4-wave primacy in pseudoscalar- and vector - mesons on the light - front , whilst maximal relative momentum promotes maximal angular momentum and hence points to an enhanced role for @xmath0-waves in @xmath17 bound - states on the light - front .      in order to determine the pdas of light - quark scalar - meson ground - states and first radial excitations , we use the direct method introduced in ref.@xcite and exploited in ref.@xcite .",

    "the vector meson is an eigenstate of the charge - conjugation operation with two non - vanishing decay - constants , so its pdas take the form @xmath255^{\\alpha_-^{\\mathpzc p } } \\sum_{z=0,2,\\ldots}^{z_{\\rm max } } a_{\\mathpzc p}^z \\,c_z^{\\alpha^{\\mathpzc p}}(x-\\bar x)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath256 and the values of @xmath257 are fixed by eqs .. with three even ( independent ) moments known accurately , we choose @xmath258 and determine @xmath259 via a least - squares fit that requires the moments of @xmath260 in eq . to match those in table  [ tablemellinmoments ] , with the results listed in table  [ pdaparams ] .",
    "the associated curves reproduce the moments with a rms - relative - error of less - than 2% .",
    "( in this case , pdas of almost equal quality are obtained by fixing @xmath261 and fitting only @xmath262 : @xmath263 , @xmath264 . )    the computed pdas of the vector meson s first radial excitation are plotted in fig.[figpdavector1 ] . at this renormalisation scale ,",
    "@xmath200 , each exhibits two zeros on @xmath198 .",
    "in fact , at @xmath265 , the number of zeros in the leading - twist pda of a @xmath242 bound - state is @xmath266 , where @xmath56 is the radial quantum number .",
    "the same things are true of the pdas describing the radial excitations of pseudoscalar mesons @xcite . however , whereas the chiral - limit pda of a radially excited pseudoscalar meson always has at least two zeros on @xmath198 @xcite , in the case of vector mesons , even in the chiral limit , there is an @xmath202 and a domain @xmath203 such that @xmath204 , the pda for each excitation with @xmath205 is positive definite on @xmath198 , _",
    "viz_.  the pda is a positive , concave function , which approaches the conformal limit form ( @xmath267 ) under further erbl evolution , just like the ground - state pdas .    in fig.[figpdavector2 ]",
    "we provide a different depiction of the vector meson pdas .",
    "this figure highlights that , as found for the ground - state , the pda describing a transversely polarised vector meson exhibits greater dilation ( is broader ) than that of the longitudinally polarised system .",
    "based on refs.@xcite , we expect this ordering to persist with increasing current - quark mass .",
    "we calculated the leading - twist parton distribution amplitudes ( pdas ) of @xmath268 , @xmath269 mesons , where @xmath56 is the radial - excitation quantum number , and @xmath270 , @xmath242 mesons , and found that , although bound - states in these channels are related by vector ward - green - takahashi identities , their pdas are very different .",
    "in fact , associating @xmath271 with the scalar systems and @xmath272 with the vector states , then the leading - twist pdas possess @xmath273 zeros on @xmath198 .",
    "we argued that this is also true for @xmath274 when the pdas are computed at an hadronic scale .",
    "notably , too , the dilation characterising ground - state pdas is also manifest in the pdas of radial excitations .",
    "we also considered the impact of @xmath2-flavour symmetry breaking . this is a little stronger in @xmath19 systems when compared with @xmath275 states , but the size of the effect is still primarily determined by the flavour - dependence of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking , as it is in all systems studied previously .",
    "it is worth remarking that in comparison with the leading - twist pdas of light - quark - antiquark @xmath19 mesons computed using sum rules in ref.@xcite , our functional forms are qualitatively in agreement .",
    "however , we find that the decay constants reported therein are too large by a factor of two .",
    "our predictions for the decay constants agree with both earlier dyson - schwinger equation results @xcite and other estimates made using sum rules @xcite .",
    "it seems , therefore , that pdas and decay constants based on those provided herein should prove valuable in any future analyses of the nonleptonic decays of heavy mesons .",
    "we would like to highlight that our results were obtained using the simplest symmetry - preserving truncation of the two - valence - body problem .",
    "they will not change qualitatively with the use of a more sophisticated truncation , but it is nevertheless worth documenting the quantitative changes , and delivering predictions in future that may reasonably be considered to be definitive .",
    "other systems , too , deserve study . for example , it is straightforward to show , using charge - conjugation properties , that the leptonic decay constant of @xmath276 mesons must vanish , just like that of scalar mesons , but the tensor decay constant need not . on the other hand , for @xmath277 mesons",
    "it is the other way around , _",
    "i.e_.  the tensor decay constant must vanish , but the leptonic decay constant need not .",
    "these features will naturally constrain the behaviour of the leading - twist pdas connected with the longitudinally and transversely polarised mesons in the associated , complementary channels to have contrasting behaviour : @xmath278 these expectations are qualitatively consistent with results of an existing sum rules analysis @xcite , but they should be checked .",
    "light - quark tensor mesons also appear in the decays of heavy mesons , but little is known about the shape of their pdas at the hadronic scale @xcite , so the techniques we described herein should also be employed in the study of tensor bound - states .",
    "it is natural to ask whether our methods can be employed to study heavy mesons in all accessible quark - antiquark channels .",
    "so far as attainable heavy - heavy systems are concerned , the answer is `` yes , reliably '' , because the rainbow - ladder ( rl ) truncation is quantitatively accurate for compact states in this limit @xcite - diagram is a generator @xcite . ] and one knows how it should sensibly be implemented @xcite . on the other hand , one can not depend upon rl truncation for analyses of the arguably more interesting case of heavy - light systems . for reasons that are well understood , connected with an imbalance between the importance of gluon - quark vertex - dressing for light - quarks as compared with heavy - quarks @xcite , rl truncation provides poor results for many qualities of heavy - light systems @xcite .",
    "it is anticipated that the use of modern dcsb - improved kernels will remedy this problem with the continuum study of these important bound - states , whose decays provide a crucial window onto the standard model and its possible extensions",
    ". however , such kernels are more difficult to use .",
    "it may therefore be worth searching for a judicious modification of the rl kernels ( as , _",
    "e.g_.  in refs.@xcite ) so as to obtain semi - quantitatively reliable predictions for the leading - twist pdas of heavy - light systems in the near term",
