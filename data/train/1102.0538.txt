    "experimental demonstration of the phenomenon of negative index of refraction first in the microwave  @xcite and latter in the optical regime  @xcite has stimulated growing interest in nonlinear properties of negative index materials  @xcite .",
    "this interest is motivated by specifics on the interaction of electromagnetic waves with negative index materials . in combination with a nonlinear response of the optical material to electromagnetic radiation",
    ", this iteration leads to a new nonlinear optical phenomena .",
    "study of these phenomena is of considerable importance both for better understanding of fundamentals of electrodynamics of negative index materials and their applications .",
    "one of the most fundamental property of negative index material is an opposite directionality of the poynting vector , characterizing the energy flux , to the wave vector @xmath0 . on the other hand",
    ", the negative index property can be realized only on particukar wavelength intervals .",
    "these two features are offering a very unusual type of multi - wave interactions , if frequencies of interacting waves correspond to frequency intervals where optical material has different signs of refractive index .",
    "multi - wave interaction must satisfy a phase matching condition , which is possible only when all wave vectors are pointed in the same direction  @xcite .",
    "therefore energy fluxes of the waves with frequencies corresponding to a negative sign of refractive index will propagate in opposite direction to those with frequencies corresponding to a positive sign of refraction index .",
    "such effect was suggested for the first time in  @xcite , which considered the particular case of three waves interaction - second harmonic generation .",
    "a solution of the equation describing second harmonic generation in the case of exact phase matching was given in  @xcite .",
    "the feasibility of parametric amplification using three - wave interaction for compensation losses in negative index materials was studied in  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of interacting wave packets propagating in negative index materials in the case of second harmonic generation was considered in  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that in contrast to a weak intensity of pump field , at high intensities a second harmonic pulse can be trapped by the pump pulse and forced to propagate in the same direction .    in this paper",
    "we investigate second harmonic generation in the presence of phase - mismatch @xmath1 .",
    "this is an important case since phase - mismatch is more relevant to realistic experimental conditions .",
    "additionally , it introduces two types of spatial distribution of second harmonic field intensity along the sample : monotonic and periodic 1 on the coordinate .",
    "both cases are considered in this paper .",
    "we also studied second harmonic generation near a critical phase - mismatch value , when the material becomes transparent for the pump wave .",
    "the system of equations describing three wave interactions ( one dimensional case ) in a @xmath2 - medium for the slowly varying envelope and phase approximation can be written in the following form  @xcite : @xmath3 where wave numbers @xmath4 are defined as follows @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the sign of the square root of @xmath7 and @xmath8 for the case of second harmonic generation eqs .",

    "this plot illustrates the dependence of the output field intensity @xmath50 , as a function of @xmath51 ( the amplitude of the fundamental field pumped into the medium ) . as shown in fig.[figmvse ] , the formal solution of equation   has multiple branches . however , only the lower branch presented by a solid curve has physical meaning .",

    "both @xmath53 and @xmath53 corresponding to these branches have singularities on the interval @xmath54 which is inconsistent with conservation of energy .",
    "note that the lower ",

    "the first type corresponds to mismatch values @xmath86 and in this case @xmath77 is not bounded from above .",

    "the second type of solutions correspond to mismatch values @xmath88 ; in this case the amplitude @xmath77 is bounded from above @xmath89 .",
