    "broad emission lines are one of the prominent properties of type 1 active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "however , due to the limit of the resolution of present , and even forseeable astronomical instruments , we have no way to resolve the geometric structure of broad emission line regions ( blrs ) by direct observations . throughout this paper",
    "we shall use the term size of blrs as equivalent of distance of the blrs to the central source . as the result of efforts of hundreds of astronomers during more than ten years",
    ", the sizes of the blrs have been estimated for more than 30 agn by the reverberation mapping technique ( blandford & mckee 1982 ; peterson 1993 ; kaspi et al .",
    "2005 ) . using a sample of 35 objects , 15 pg quasars and 21 seyfert 1 galaxies , a strong correlation between the size of blrs and",
    "the continuum luminosity has been found ( kaspi et al . 2000 ; 2005 ) .",
    "the empirical relation @xmath7 indicates that both the ionization continuum and the electron density of the blrs for normal agn are not much different , and provides a convenient way to estimate the central bh masses for agn under the assumption of virialization ( greene & ho 2005b ; ovcharov et al .",
    "2005 ; wu et al .",
    "2004 ; mclure & jarvis 2004 ; 2002 ; marziani et al .",
    "2003 ) , especially for objects with low and intermediate redshifts and high s / n spectra ( sulentic et al .",
    "2006 ) . due to the difficulty to measure the stellar velocity dispersion , the relation @xmath8 which can be extrapolated for intermediate bh masses in the range of @xmath9 ( barth et al . 2005",
    "; greene & ho 2004 ) , can not be applied to higher luminosity and higher redshift agn ( tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ; ferrarese & merritt 2001 ; gebhardt , bender et al .",
    "2000 ) .    in paper",
    "i we have shown that the empirical relation @xmath10 is not valid for a special kind of agn : low luminosity active galaxies with @xmath11 selected from ho et al .",
    "( 1997a , 1997b ) , and called dwarf agn by them .",
    "the deviation of this empirical relation for low luminosity agn may be explained in terms of a lower ionization parameter and/or lower electron density of blrs in these type of agn ( although see discussion paper i ) .",
    "broad emission lines ( often only @xmath12 ) can be detected in the spectra of these type of galaxies indicating the presence of activity in their nuclei , and there is also other evidence for the presence of massive black holes in low luminosity agn ( nakai et al .",
    "1993 ; sarzi et al .",
    "2001 ) . in the case of low luminosity agn with intermediate bh masses@xmath13 , however , several objects have been studied individually in order to check if they follow the correlation @xmath8 : pox 52 ( barth et al .",
    "2004 ) , ngc 4395 ( kraemer et al . 1999 ; filippenko & ho 2003 ) , ngc4051 ( shemmer et al . 2003 ) and various objects selected from sdss ( greene & ho 2004 ) . the consistency between the bh masses estimated using the relation @xmath8 and estimated under the assumption of virialization , indicates that the size of blrs for these agn with intermediate bh masses must obey the empirical relation @xmath14 .",
    "thus the question of whether all the sizes of blrs of low luminosity agn obey the empirical relation is an interesting one . in this paper , we use a larger sample of low luminosity agn to further investigate this question , in order to find a more consistent explanation for the deviation of the empirical relation for low luminosity agn reported in paper i. the next section presents the sample . the results are shown in section iii .",
    "section iv gives the discussion and conclusion . in this paper ,",
    "the cosmological parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 have been adopted .",
    "in a spectroscopic survey of more than four hundred nearby galaxies , there are 34 agn , of which the broad emission lines have been detected with confidence , and 12 agn with less certainty ( ho et al .",
    "1997a , 1997b ) . in paper",
    "i , we selected 22 low luminosity agn with broad emission h@xmath5 , 4 seyfert galaxies and also 18 liners selected from the sample of ho et al .",
    "( 1997a , 1997b ) , to study the size of blrs .    as in paper",
    "i , we select low luminosity agn according to the criterion that @xmath0 ( see also ho et al .",
    "1997a ; 1997b ) .",
    "we first select 42 low luminosity agn from ho et al .",
    "( 1997b ) , including the objects ngc4051 and ngc4395 , for which the galactic and internal reddening have been corrected using the values given by ho et al .",
    "( 1997a ) : the internal color excess can be found in their table 4 , the galactic color excess can be found in their table 11 .",
    "although there are 46 objects for which broad h@xmath5 lines have been detected , there are four objects ngc1275 , ngc4151 , ngc3516 and ngc5548 with a luminosity of h@xmath5 larger than @xmath18 , thus , we reject them for our sample . furthermore , in paper i , there are 7 objects with double - peaked broad low - ionization emission lines ( dbp emitters ) , we excluded these objects from our new sample . finally , we also selected low luminosity agn from the literature according to the above defined criterion for @xmath19 . we find four additional objects which can be selected as candidate , pox 52 ( barth et al .",
    "2004 ) , sdss j024912.86 - 081525.6 , sdss j143450.62 + 033842.5 and sdss j233837.10 - 002810.3 ( greene & ho 2004 , 2005b ) . in order to estimate the bh masses , we compile the velocity dispersion of the bulge for each object .",
    "if there are no data for the velocity dispersion of the bulge , we use the line width of the strong narrow emission line [ nii]@xmath20 .",
    "the strong correlation between the line width of the narrow emission lines and the stellar velocity dispersion of the bulge has been studied by several authors ( e.g. nelson & whittle 1996 ; greene & ho 2005a ) .",
    "the sample objects are listed in table 1 .",
    "finally , we select the 35 objects with accurate determinations for the sizes of their blrs estimated from reverberation mapping technique , in order to compare the difference for the two kinds of agn , low luminosity and normal agn .",
    "the 35 normal agn can be found in kaspi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and peterson et al .",
    "we do not list them again .",
    "as described in paper i , we estimate the size of blrs of low luminosity agn using :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the line width of broad h@xmath5 , and @xmath23 is a factor related to the orbits of the emission clouds .",
    "it is also pointed out that @xmath24 is the most convenient value discussed in the literature . in more recent literature , however , onken et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found that @xmath25 and peterson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found the mean value of @xmath26 .",
    "thus , here we take @xmath27 rather than @xmath28",
    ".    there are 38 low luminosity agn , for which the stellar velocity dispersions can be compiled from the recent literature .",
    "there is one object , ngc4395 , of which the upper limit value of stellar velocity dispersion , @xmath29 , can be selected from fillippenko & ho ( 2003 ) . in order to estimate the bh masses for the other seven",
    ", we first check the correlation between the stellar velocity dispersion and the line width of narrow emission lines .",
    "we adopt the [ nii]@xmath20 measurements of ho et al .",
    "( 1997a ) .",
    "we show this correlation in fig 1 .",
    "the spearman rank correlation coefficient is 0.77 with @xmath30 .",
    "the mean value of @xmath31 is about @xmath32 . here",
    ", we do not consider the object ngc 1068 , because of the special geometric structure of its narrow emission line region ( nlr ) , which has been observed with hst .",
    "the nlr of ngc 1068 consists of a large set of clouds ( macchetto et al .",
    "1994 ; capetti et al .",
    "1995 ; dietrich & wagner 1998 ; cecil et al . 2002 ) which leads to a larger than mean value of line width for narrow emission lines .",
    "the strong correlation seen in fig 1 indicates that we can confidently estimate the bh masses for the eight low luminosity agn without velocity dispersions using the line width of [ nii]@xmath20 .",
    "somewhat larger stellar velocity dispersions than those derived from @xmath33}$ ] are perhaps due to a larger distance of the [ nii ] emission line clouds to the central source .",
    "thus , the sizes of blrs for these eight low luminosity agn can also be estimated .",
    "the sizes of the blrs are listed in table 1 .",
    "notice the case of the low luminosity agn ngc 4395 ( because the size of blrs has been measured by reverberation mapping technique by peterson et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , thus we list the object individually ) for which the bh mass estimated from the upper limit of stellar velocity dispersion is about @xmath34 ( we think the upper limit of stellar velocity from keck high - resolution spectra is more reliable than the upper limit of line width of [ nii ] ) , which is about four to six times smaller than the bh mass @xmath35 derived recently under the assumption of virialization and using reverberation mapping by peterson et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "we can now compare the empirical relation @xmath6 for low luminosity agn to that of normal agn . as we can see from figure 2 , the result from paper",
    "i is confirmed .",
    "the size of blrs of low luminosity agn is larger than the prediction of the empirical relation @xmath6 .",
    "the mean value of @xmath36 is about @xmath37 for low luminosity agn except ngc4395 .",
    "the spearman rank correlation coefficient is 0.06 with @xmath38 . for ngc 4395 , the object mentioned above",
    ", the size of the blrs is about 0.04 light - days derived directly from the variation of the civ emission line , which is much smaller than the upper limit value derived from the upper limit bh masses using broad h@xmath5 : 1.28 light - days .",
    "however , the emission regions of high - ionization civ should be nearer to the central black hole than the regions of low - ionization h@xmath5 .",
    "we do notice , however , that there are some low luminosity agn including four objects with intermediate bh masses , for which the sizes of the blrs do obey the empirical relation @xmath6 .",
    "thus , it is important to further investigate which parameter dominates the size of blrs of both low luminosity and normal agn .      due to the strong correlation between bh mass and the continuum luminosity , there is also a strong correlation between bh mass and the size of blrs for normal agn .",
    "we investigate if the same holds for low luminosity agn , which can be somehow expected given that the sizes of the blrs are also calculated from bh masses .",
    "the correlations between @xmath39 and @xmath40 are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the spearman rank correlation coefficient is -0.09 with @xmath41 for low luminosity agn except ngc4395 , and it is 0.87 with @xmath42 for normal agn .",
    "thus , we see that the correlations are different .",
    "next , we show the correlations between @xmath39 and @xmath43 in figure 4 .",
    "the spearman rank correlation coefficient is 0.94 with @xmath44 for low luminosity agn except ngc4395 , and 0.90 with @xmath45 for the 35 normal agn .",
    "the unweight linear relations for low luminosity agn except ngc4395 and normal agn are :    @xmath46    a correlation between @xmath39 and @xmath43 can be expected , because of the fundamental formula @xmath47 .",
    "however , the results above show that there is no simple linear relation @xmath48 , instead @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "thus we can still say that there is a correlation between bh masses and line width .",
    "we shall next define and calculate a parameter related to the dimensionless accretion rate , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the bolometric luminosity for normal agn ( wandel et al .",
    "1999 ; kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ) and @xmath53 is the eddington luminosity @xmath54 .",
    "it is difficult to determine accurately the continuum luminosity of the nucleus for low luminosity agn , because of the dominant component from stellar light and the lack of big blue bump .",
    "unfortunately , it was also shown by ho ( 1999 ) that for low luminosity agn , the bolometric luminosity can not be estimated as @xmath55 , since for example the ratio of bolometric luminosity to continuum luminosity at 5100@xmath56 for the low luminosity agn m81 ( ngc 3031 ) is about 10 , whereas the same ratio for another low luminosity agn , ngc 4261 , is more than 500!. greene & ho ( 2005b ) found a strong correlation between the optical continuum luminosity and the luminosity of h@xmath5 ( including both broad and narrow components ) using a sample of normal agn selected from sdss , but we can not be sure that the same correlation applies to low luminosity agn . in what follows , we use the total ( broad + narrow ) luminosity of h@xmath5 to define and calculate another dimensionless accretion rate : @xmath3 : @xmath57 .",
    "the correlation between the size of blrs and the dimensionless accretion rate @xmath3 is shown in figure 5 .",
    "the spearman rank correlation coefficient is -0.71 with @xmath58 for low luminosity agn except ngc4395 . for the normal 35 agn , we select",
    "the 12 objects with measured stellar velocity dispersions to calculate the dimensionless accretion rate @xmath4 , and the luminosities of h@xmath5 for the 12 objects are estimated from the continuum luminosity by the correlation found by greene & ho ( 2005b ) : @xmath59 the correlation coefficient is 0.76 with @xmath60 for the 12 normal agn .",
    "the unweighted linear relation for low luminosity agn is : @xmath61 due to the small number of normal agn , we can not confirm whether the different correlation between @xmath43 and @xmath3 for low luminosity and normal agn is really true .",
    "however , we can confirm that the few low luminosity agn for which the sizes of the blrs are consistent with the empirical correlation @xmath10 , have large values of @xmath3 than @xmath62 .",
    "these low luminosity agn have been marked with names or shown as triangles in figure 2 .",
    "bh masses estimated from stellar velocity dispersion are reliable for low luminosity agn .",
    "if the size of the blrs of low luminosity agn with bh masses larger than @xmath63 would obey the correlation @xmath64 , their lower continuum luminosity would lead to at least one order of magnitude larger width of broad lines than what is observed in our sample .",
    "such broader emission lines can not be detected in high resolution spectra of hst .",
    "with respect to the issue of the detectability limit of broad emission lines for ground based observations , we wish to point out as an example that barth et al .",
    "( 2001 ) observed the blrs for one low luminosity liner : ngc 4579 , with the stis on hst , and detected broad h@xmath5 with the same width , @xmath65 , as the value detected by ho et al .",
    "( 1997b ) . in the following section",
    ", we will see that the line widths of broad h@xmath5 in our sample selected from ho et al .",
    "( 1997b ) are not much less than 2300@xmath66 , thus we think these line widths are not limited by the palomar spectra detection capability .",
    "we can not rule out however , the possibility that there may be two distinct blrs for at least some low luminosity agn : the one observed in the reported objects , and a very broad one near to the black hole , possibly emitting double peaked lines , which is presently undetectable .    in this paper",
    "we have investigated the role of luminosity in the structure of the blr . in paper",
    "i it was found that low - luminosity agn have abnormally large blrs for a given luminosity , compared to more luminous normal agn .",
    "the current paper expands the sample of low - luminosity agn to include not only massive bhs in low accretion states , but also intermediate - mass black holes radiating close to their eddington limits .",
    "the latter , with possibly one exception , despite their comparably low luminosities , appear to have normal - sized blrs .",
    "the dependence of blrs structure on luminosity and eddington ratio may have important implications for bh mass measurements and agn physics in general . according to the high accretion rate of @xmath3 of ngc4395",
    ", we can expect that the size of blrs , particularly the emission regions of low - ionization braod h@xmath5 should be consistent with the value from the empirical relation of @xmath6 .",
