    "the observational properties of stars near the main sequence turn - off ( msto ) have a natural primacy in studies of the star - forming history ( sfh ) of galaxies .",
    "however , with the exception of stars that formed within the past few hundred myr , crowding and the intrinsic faintness of the msto restrict its use to local group galaxies .",
    "core helium - burning stars provide an alternate means of probing the stellar content of more distant systems ( e.g. mcquinn et al .",
    "2011 ) , although these stars can only be resolved in relatively low surface brightness areas of galaxies in the nearest groups .",
    "stars evolving near the tip of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) are among the most luminous objects in a galaxy , and so offer another means of investigating stellar content .",
    "the stars on the upper few magnitudes of the agb can have a wide range of ages , extending back @xmath7 gyr for solar metallicities , and so have the potential to provide constraints on the sfh over a large fraction of the age of the universe .",
    "the red colors of the most luminous agb stars make them well - suited for study with adaptive optics ( ao)-equipped ground - based telescopes , since the corrections delivered by ao systems improve towards longer wavelengths .",
    "because they are very bright and have colors that are much redder than the majority of other luminous stars in a galaxy , agb stars will be resolved in the near and mid - infrared with future space - based facilites  such as the jwst  in systems that are well outside of the local group .",
    "still , given their highly evolved nature , models of agb stars can be uncertain ( e.g. discussion by marigo et al .",
    "2008 ) , and there has been mixed success matching observations with model predictions ( e.g. zibetti et al . 2013",
    "; melbourne et al .",
    "2012 ; girardi et al .",
    "this has motivated recent efforts to characterize the behaviour of agb stars in dwarf galaxies that span a broader range of metallicities than is sampled by the magellanic clouds and the milky - way , which have heretofore been the key calibrators of agb properties ( e.g. rosenfield et al .",
    "2014 ; melbourne et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the local group compact elliptical ( ce ) galaxy m32 is a fundamental laboratory for probing agb evolution and investigating the role that these stars play in stellar content studies .",
    "m32 is close enough to allow the msto stars that probe the early phases of its evolution to be resolved , so that its sfh can be probed in detail ( e.g. monachesi et al . 2012 ) . at the same time , m32 is also far enough away and has a high enough stellar density that integrated spectra that are not subject to stochastic sampling effects can be recorded in its high surface brightness central regions . that a rich population of agb stars in m32 can be resolved over a wide range of radii ( e.g. davidge & jensen 2007 )",
    "also means that the problems associated with low number statistics that plague studies of agb stars in more diffuse and/or less massive systems are avoided .",
    "the utility of m32 for testing techniques to probe stellar content has been amply demonstrated in the past .",
    "m32 has been the target of numerous spectroscopic studies , and these have revealed signatures of a substantial  possibly even dominant  population with an age of a few gyr .",
    "absorption lines originating from the balmer series of hydrogen  most noteably h@xmath8 ( e.g. oconnell 1980 ; bica et al .",
    "1990 ; rose 1994 ; schiavon et al .",
    "2004 )  and the first - overtone co bands ( davidge 1990 ) have depths in the integrated spectrum of m32 that are indicative of a large intermediate age population .",
    "this has been confirmed by the subsequent study of resolved agb ( e.g. davidge 2000 ; davidge & jensen 2007 ) and msto ( monachesi et al . 2012 ) stars .",
    "spectroscopic studies also reveal a near solar luminosity - weighted metallicity .",
    "this is consistent with the metallicities of individual agb stars in the central regions of m32 ( davidge et al .",
    "2010 ) and the mean photometric properties of red giant branch ( rgb ) stars at large radii ( grillmair et al . 1996 ; monachesi et al . 2012 ) .",
    "the origins of m32 are enigmatic . while the structural characterics of m32 are reminiscent of a classical elliptical galaxy ( e.g. kormendy 1985 ) , its near - solar metallicity is consistent with it being the remnant of what was once a much larger galaxy .",
    "in addition to having a relatively high mean metallicity for its mass , the location of m32 on the fe @xmath9 mg@xmath10 plane is indicative of a [ mg / fe ] that is lower than in most early - type galaxies ( worthey et al .",
    "this hints that sne i played a significant role in the chemical enrichment of m32 .",
    "this is not expected for spheroidal systems that experienced rapid chemical enrichment , but is associated with disks that are stable over time scales of at least a few hundred myr .",
    "m32 and m31 are in close physical proximity at present , with a projected separation of only a few kpc ( e.g. evans et al . 2000 ; sarajedini et al .",
    "this raises the prospect of past interactions between them , and bekki et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggest that m32 is the remnant of a disk - dominated galaxy that was threshed by tidal interactions with m31 .",
    "if the progenitor of m32 was a disk galaxy then this could explain the chemical mixture of m32 .",
    "the tidal threshing model could also explain other properties of m32 , such as the lack of a globular cluster system , its low gas content ( sage et al .",
    "1998 ; grcevich & putman 2009 ) , and the uniform mixing of rr lyraes with other stellar types ( sarajedini et al . 2012 ) .",
    "there may have been more recent encounters between m31 and m32 .",
    "block et al .",
    "( 2006 ) argue that a satellite of m31  presumably m32  passed through the inner regions of its disk a few hundred myr ago .",
    "such an encounter is consistent with the complex dynamical state of the ism near the center of m31 ( e.g. melchior & combes 2011 ) .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 2012 ) find that the dust properties of the central few kpc of m31 may also have been affected by an interaction , and note that the dust mass within the central 3 kpc is comparable to that expected in a dwarf galaxy .",
    "the concentration of bright agb stars along one arm of the m31 major axis ( davidge et al .",
    "2012 ; davidge 2012 ; dalcanton et al .",
    "2012 ) may also have formed during this event . a basic prediction of the block et al .",
    "( 2006 ) model is that the interaction with m32 triggered disturbances in the ism of m31 that are propogating outwards , spurring star - formation as they go .",
    "the presence of such a propogating density wave is not consistent with the long - lived nature of the star - forming rings ( davidge et al .",
    "2012 ; dalcanton et al .",
    "2012 ) , and may have difficulties explaining related shell - like structures in the outermost regions of the disk ( fritz et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "monachesi et al .",
    "( 2012 ) use deep images of the outer regions of m32 to resolve stars near the msto and examine the sfh .",
    "they conclude that m32 is not coeval .",
    "there is a dominant component that is older than 5 gyr , and a significant population with an age 2  5 gyr .",
    "the msto of the oldest stars is not detected , and so firm constraints can not be placed on the mass fraction that formed during very early epochs .",
    "a population of stars that is younger than 2 gyr and accounts for a few percent of the total stellar mass was also detected .",
    "while msto stars are primary probes of stellar age , blue stragglers , and contamination from clusters of young stars in the outer disk of m31 add uncertainties to age estimates obtained from the msto , and may account for at least some fraction of this relatively young component .",
    "obtaining agreement between the sfhs deduced from agb and msto stars in nearby galaxies is an important step if agb stars are to be considered as probes of more distant systems .",
    "there are challenges inherent to detecting the most evolved agb stars in the visible , even though this is a wavelength region that has been explored in detail and is where space - based facilities typically deliver their best angular resolution .",
    "the most evolved rgb and agb stars with moderate and higher metallicities have cool photospheric temperatures that are conducive to the formation of deep absorption bands of tio and zro at visible and red wavelengths , and blanketing from these species forces the rgb and agb sequences in the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) at visual wavelengths to slump over ( e.g. see discussion in ortolani et al .",
    "this complicates efforts to measure the luminosities of the brightest agb stars , while also making agb - tip stars more susceptible to blending with sources that have lower intrinsic luminosities .",
    "the detection of highly evolved agb stars at visible wavelengths may also be affected by obscuration from circumstellar dust .",
    "many of the challenges that are inherent to the detection of bright agb stars at visible wavelengths are eased when observing in the near- and mid - infrared ( nir and mir ) .",
    "the effects of line blanketing and circumstellar obscuration are significantly reduced at these wavelengths . in addition ,",
    "cool agb stars are significantly brighter in the infrared than the bulk of the underlying population that contributes most of the stellar mass . when observed in the nir and mir , the coolest agb stars",
    "are thus less susceptible to blending and can be used to probe regions in galaxies where msto stars can not be detected . in the particular case of m32 , agb stars have been resolved in @xmath11 and @xmath1 by ao - equipped ground - based telescopes to within a few arcsec of the galaxy center ( e.g. davidge et al . 2000 ,",
    "davidge & jensen 2007 ; davidge et al .",
    "this is a part of the galaxy where there is no hope of resolving stars near the msto in the foreseeable future .",
    "the high emissivity associated with ground - based facilities is a formidable obstacle for studying all but the brightest sources in the mir . while deep mir observations are the exclusive purview of space - based facilities , these same facilities have poorer angular resolution than ground - based facilities due to their modest apertures .",
    "the superior angular resolution offered by ground - based facilities provides a niche that can be exploited , at least at the shortest mir wavelengths .    in the present study ,",
    "data obtained with the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) , gemini north ( gn ) , and the spitzer satellite are used to investigate the nir and mir photometric properties of ( 1 ) the most luminous stars in m32 and ( 2 ) the isophotal properties of the integrated light .",
    "the data sample wavelengths where a significant fraction of the light from the coolest stars is emitted .",
    "the sample of resolved stars is comprised mainly of objects evolving on the upper agb , as crowding in the mir data effectively prevents the detection of rgb stars ( section 4.2 ) .",
    "the gn observations are of particular interest for isophotal studies as they explore the central regions of the galaxy between 3 and @xmath12 m with sub - arcsec angular resolution , which is not possible with the current generation of space - based infrared facilities .",
    "wavelength - dependent differences in isophotal characteristics such as eccentricities and fiducial radii could point to age gradients and/or distinct structural components .    a distance of @xmath13 kpc for m32 , measured from the brightness of the rgb - tip by evans et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and corresponding to a distance modulus @xmath14 , is adopted here .",
    "our conclusions would not change if the distance modulus were varied by @xmath15 magnitude .",
    "a foreground reddening of a@xmath16 , taken from the schlafly & finkbeiner ( 2011 ) re - calibration of the schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) maps , is also used throughout this paper .",
    "the absence of warm and cool interstellar dust ( gordon et al .",
    "2006 ) and the colors of rr lyraes ( sarajedini et al . 2012 ) suggests that there is no internal reddening . finally , the ` average ' reddening law listed in table 1 of indebetouw et al .",
    "( 2005 ) is adopted for mir wavelengths .",
    "details of the observations and their reduction are described in section 2 , while the procedures used to construct , calibrate , and characterize the photometric measurements are discussed in section 3 .",
    "the cmds obtained from these data are presented in section 4 , and the nir and mir luminosity functions ( lfs ) are compared with models in section 5 .",
    "the isophotal properties of m32 in the nir and mir are examined in section 6 .",
    "the paper closes in section 7 with a brief discussion and summary of the results .",
    "post basic calibrated dataset ( pbcd ) mosaics of irac ( fazio et al . 2004 ) images in [ 3.6 ] , [ 4.5 ] , [ 5.8 ] , and [ 8.0 ] from program i d 3400 ( pi rich ) were downloaded from the nasa / ipac infrared science archive . the [ 5.8 ] mosaic of m32 and the surroundings is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the data were recorded with on - sky offsets to cover a field that is larger than that sampled by a single exposure , and the total exposure time varies across the mosaiced field . only the area in the mosaics that has the largest effective exposure time , and hence the deepest and most uniform photometric characteristics , was considered for this study .",
    "the extracted m32 field covers a @xmath17 arcmin@xmath18 area that is centered near @xmath19 = 00:42:56 , @xmath20 = 40:45:48 ( e2000 ) .",
    "the images in all four irac channels were used to obtain the brightnesses of individual bright stars in and around m32 , thereby allowing mir cmds and lfs to be constructed . in addition , the [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] images were used to examine the isophotal properties of m32 .",
    "the [ 5.8 ] and [ 8.0 ] images were not considered for this latter analysis as the isophotal properties of m32 could not be traced to radii @xmath21 arcmin in those images .",
    "the geometry of the irac detector arrays allows parallel [ 3.6 ] and [ 5.8 ] observations to be recorded of a field that samples the outer disk of m31 directly to the east of m32 .",
    "this field also overlaps with moderately deep archival wircam data ( section 2.2 ) .",
    "a sub - section of this field that covers a @xmath22 arcmin@xmath18 area and is centered near @xmath19 = 00:42:56 , @xmath20 = + 40:45:48.3 ( e2000 ) was used to assess contamination from the m31 disk in the m32 irac data .",
    "the location of the m31 outer disk field is indicated in figure 1 .",
    "parallel observations that sample a field to the west of m32 were also recorded in [ 4.5 ] and [ 8.0 ] .",
    "this parallel field samples an area that is closer to the main body of m31 than m32 .",
    "the stellar content is less homogeneous in this field because of increased contamination from the main disk of m31 , raising the concern that it may not be representative of the m31 disk near m32 .",
    "therefore , this parallel field was not considered when assessing disk contamination .",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath1 photometry of stars in m32 and the outer disk of m31 were obtained from archival cfht wircam ( puget et al . 2004 ) images .",
    "the detector in wircam is a mosiac of four @xmath24 hgcdte arrays arranged in a @xmath25 format with 45 arcsec gaps between arrays .",
    "each wircam pointing covers a @xmath26 arcmin@xmath18 field with 0.3 arcsec pixel@xmath27 sampling .",
    "the images used here are of pointings m31 - 401 and m31 - 405 from programs 2009bc29 ( pi : sick ) and 2009bh52 ( pi : tully ) .",
    "twenty - five 20 sec @xmath23 exposures and twenty - six 20 sec @xmath28 exposures that had been processed with the iiwi pipeline were downloaded from the cfht archive at the canadian astronomical data centre .",
    "these were aligned to correct for on - sky offsets and the median of the pixel intensity distribution , which serves as a proxy for the mean sky level , was subtracted from each frame .",
    "the results were then stacked by finding the median intensity at each pixel location , trimmed to the area of common angular coverage , and transformed to the orientation of the irac images using the geomap and geotrans tasks in iraf .",
    "stars in the final images have 0.7 arcsec fwhm .",
    "ground - based observations in the mir are hampered by high levels of emissivity , which mushrooms in size at wavelengths longward of @xmath29 m to produce noise of monumental proportions .",
    "the high background levels hinder efforts to study all but comparatively bright objects in the mir with ground - based telescopes .",
    "this severe handicap notwithstanding , the large apertures of ground - based facilities results in angular resolutions that surpass those delivered by space - based telescopes , providing a niche for ground - based mir observing .",
    "ground - based observations are at present the only means of obtaining sub - arcsec angular resolution images in the mir .    the central regions of m32 were observed with niri ( hodapp et al .",
    "2003 ) through @xmath28 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 filters as part of queue program gn-2006b - q-64 ( pi : davidge ) .",
    "the niri detector is a @xmath32 insb array .",
    "the f/32 camera was used for these observations , and each exposure thus samples a @xmath33 arcsec@xmath18 field with 0.022 arcsec pixel@xmath27 sampling .",
    "the @xmath28 images were corrected for wavefront distortions using the gn facility ao system altair ( herriot et al .",
    "altair was used in natural guide star ( ngs ) mode , with the semi - stellar nucleus of m32 serving as the ngs .",
    "twenty images , each consisting of three coadded 5 sec exposures , were recorded .",
    "a dither pattern that samples the corners of a @xmath34 arcsec square was used to facilitate the identification and suppression of cosmic rays and cosmetic defects .",
    "five exposures were recorded at each dither position .",
    "the telescope was offset to one of four background fields that are located 90 arcsec to the north , south , east , and west of the galaxy nucleus after each dither position was observed .",
    "these background fields monitor the sky level , and allow a calibration frame to be constructed that can be used to remove thermal emission from warm sources along the optical path ( see below ) .",
    "the reduction of the @xmath28 images followed standard procedures for nir imaging , and utilized three calibration frames .",
    "the first of these monitors the dark current , and this was constructed by median - combining frames taken of the unilluminated array that have the same exposure times as the science data .",
    "the resulting dark frame was subtracted from each image .",
    "the second calibration frame monitors flat - field variations , and was constructed from a series of exposures that involve the gemini facility calibration unit ( gcal ) .",
    "a series of images with the gcal light source turned on were recorded , and these were followed by another sequence in which the gcal light source was turned off .",
    "the first set of images contain signatures of the flat - field pattern ( multiplicative in nature ) combined with thermal emission ( additive in nature ) , whereas the second set contains only signatures from thermal emission .",
    "taking the difference between the two sets of exposures thus removes the thermal emission , leaving behind the flat - field information .",
    "the difference between the two sets of images was normalized to unity and the dark - subtracted images were divided by the resulting flat - field frame .",
    "a third calibration frame was constructed to remove thermal signatures that are produced by warm objects along the optical path , such as dust on exposed optical surfaces .",
    "such objects glow in the infrared and are out of focus , producing diffuse signatures that usually become evident only after flat - fielding .",
    "flat - fielded images of the background fields were median - combined after the mean sky level was subtracted from each image to remove variations in the sky brightness to construct a thermal contamination calibration frame .",
    "the result was subtracted from the flat - fielded m32 images .",
    "the images that were corrected for thermal emission were aligned and combined by taking the median intensity at each pixel location .",
    "the result was trimmed to the area common to all exposures .",
    "stars in the final @xmath28 image have fwhm = 0.09 arcsec .",
    "altair could not be used for the @xmath30 and @xmath31 observations as it has transmissive optical components that introduce background signal at wavelengths longward of @xmath29 m that saturates the niri detector . even without altair ,",
    "the high ambient background in @xmath30 and @xmath31 necessitates the use of short exposures to prevent saturation .",
    "a single observation at each dither position in @xmath30 consisted of 30 co - added 0.6 sec exposures , while a single observation in @xmath31 consisted of nine exposures , each of which was made up of 34 co - added 0.5 sec exposures .",
    "the @xmath30 and @xmath31 observations were recorded with a 5 point dither pattern that samples the four corners and the middle of a @xmath35 arcsec square .",
    "the dither pattern was repeated seven times in each filter , and the total on - source exposure times are 630 sec in @xmath30 and 5355 sec in @xmath31 .",
    "one of four background fields located along the cardinal axes was observed following each complete observation at a dither position .",
    "the construction of flat - field frames in @xmath30 and @xmath31 is problematic given the high levels of thermal emission in the mir . in any event , thermal noise dominates in these filters , and so the primary processing step is the removal of thermal emission signatures .",
    "the mean intensity and noise pattern in the background field observations varies from exposure - to - exposure , with the largest variations in @xmath31 . to account for this variability ,",
    "a calibration image was constructed for each m32 exposure by linearly interpolating between successive background field observations .",
    "the interpolated images were then subtracted from the m32 exposures .",
    "the resulting background - subtracted images have substantially lower residual noise than those constructed using either the preceeding or subsequent background observation .",
    "even so , residual thermal signal at the few percent level remains , indicating that the variations in the thermal background vary in a manner that is more complicated than the linear trend assumed here .",
    "the background - subtracted @xmath30 and @xmath31 frames were aligned and the median intensity at each pixel was found after a residual mean sky level , which was measured near the edges of the field , was subtracted from each image .",
    "the @xmath31 images were aligned using the nucleus of m32 , which is the only source detected in individual frames .",
    "the relatively modest signal from the center of m32 in @xmath31 introduces @xmath36 arcsec ( i.e. a few pixels ) uncertainties in the alignment of the individual @xmath31 exposures .",
    "the final processing step was to trim the stacked @xmath30 and @xmath31 images to the area that is common to all pointings .",
    "individual stars are seen in the final @xmath30 image , and these have fwhm = 0.18 arcsec .",
    "as for the @xmath31 images , these were recorded over two nights during only fair seeing conditions , and individual stars are not detected .",
    "the angular resolution of these data , measured from observations of standard stars that were observed throughout the m32 observing sequence , is 0.40 arcsec fwhm .",
    "the irac instrument handbook advises against the use of point spread function ( psf)-fitting to extract photometry from irac images , with non - uniformities in pixel sensitivity and the undersampling of the psf cited as concerns .",
    "still , numerous studies of the stellar contents of nearby galaxies have used psf - fitting to extract photometry from irac images ( e.g. meixner et al .",
    "2006 , mcquinn et al . 2007 ;",
    "mould et al .",
    "2008 ) , as it is an accepted means of performing photometry in crowded environments . to assess the best means of measuring stellar brightnesses in the current study , two sets of photometric measurements",
    "were made from the [ 3.6 ] and [ 5.8 ] images : ( 1 ) aperture photometry with brightnesses obtained from the phot routine in the daophot ( stetson 1987 ) package , and ( 2 ) psf - fitting photometry using allstar ( stetson & harris 1988 ) .",
    "sources within 90 arcsec of the center of m32 were not photometered , as surface brightness fluctuations in this high - density region can masquerade as individual stars . both sets of photometry",
    "were calibrated using flux zeropoints calculated by reach et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "crowding is an obvious concern when conducting aperture photometry in external galaxies . to mitigate against crowding ,",
    "the aperture measurements were made with a comparatively narrow 3 pixel ( 1.8 arcsec ) radius .",
    "final brightnesses were then obtained by applying an aperture correction that was measured from stars in uncrowded parts of the images .",
    "an additional concern for crowded extragalactic environments is that non - uniformities in the integrated surface brightness can occur over angular scales that are comparable to the area where the local sky level is measured , and these introduce errors into both aperture and psf - fitting measurements . to correct for localized sky structure ,",
    "a running boxcar median filter with dimensions that are sufficient to suppress stars was applied to the images , and the resulting smoothed image was subtracted from the data .",
    "psfs were constructed using tasks in daophot ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "a single psf was constructed for each filter , and faint objects close to psf stars were subtracted out using progressively improved versions of the psf . once",
    "a final psf was obtained then the final photometric measurements were made with the psf - fitting routine in allstar ( stetson & harris 1988 ) .",
    "the phot and allstar routines estimate the uncertainty in photometric measurements using the properties of the source and the surrounding background .",
    "the photometric measurements of objects that are in crowded environments and/or that are non - stellar in appearance have higher uncertainties than those in uncrowded environments that have a star - like light profile . to remove sources with problematic photometry , objects that depart from the general trend on the error @xmath9 magnitude relation for each filter were removed from the photometric catalogue .",
    "this parallels the procedure applied by davidge ( 2010 ) to psf - fitting photometry , where objects were rejected using the uncertainty computed by allstar .",
    "davidge ( 2013 ) found that the properties of the final sample culled using photometric error are similar to those that result when other object characteristics , such as image sharpness , are used to identify sources with problematic photometry .",
    "the @xmath37 , [ 3.6 ] - [ 5.8])$ ] cmds obtained from aperture and psf - fitting measurements for sources in m32 and the m31 disk field are compared in figure 2 .",
    "the standard deviation about the mean [ 3.6][5.8 ] for objects with [ 5.8 ] between 15.75 and 16.25 , @xmath38 , is shown for each cmd .",
    "this brightness interval samples agb stars in a heavily populated part of each cmd , and is well above the faint limit .",
    "an iterative @xmath39 rejection filter was applied to suppress outliers when computing @xmath38 .",
    "the cmds constructed with psf - fitting sample a larger number of objects and go significantly fainter than those obtained from aperture measurements . while the differences between @xmath38 computed from the aperture and psf - fitting photometric measurements are modest , the agb sequence when [ 5.8 ] @xmath40 in the psf - fitting cmd of m32 is better defined than in the aperture photometry cmd . given ( 1 ) the differences in the number of objects between the two sets of cmds , and ( 2 ) the tightness of the bright end of the m32 cmd obtained with psf - fitting , then psf - fitting",
    "is adopted as the prefered photometry technique .",
    "the psf - fitting program allstar was used to obtain photometric measurements from the wircam and niri images .",
    "as with the irac observations , the psfs were constructed from bright , isolated stars , and an iterative scheme was applied to suppress faint neighboring stars .",
    "no attempt was made to photometer objects within 90 arcsec of the galaxy center in the wircam images , as crowding confounds efforts to resolve individual stars there unless the data have an angular resolution @xmath41 arcsec fwhm ( e.g. davidge et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the wircam photometry was calibrated using zeropoints obtained from standard star observations that were recorded during the same semester , and this information is available on the cfht web site .",
    "the niri photometry was calibrated using zeropoints obtained from standard star observations that were recorded as part of the baseline calibration set for this program .",
    "the irac observations have angular resolutions that are significantly poorer than the wircam data .",
    "the wircam data can then be used to assess in a preliminary way the effect of crowding on the mir data .",
    "emphasis is placed on the [ 3.6 ] data for these experiments , as ( 1 ) this passband is closest in wavelength to the wircam observations , and ( 2 ) at longer wavelengths crowding is expected to become less of an issue because of the increased contrast between the brightest agb stars and the vast majority of other stars in m32 .",

    "the light profiles are compared in the top panel of figure 15 .",
    "a cluster of bad pixels causes a gap in the radial coverage of the wircam observations , and the affected interval is indicated . the surface brightness profile in the central 150 arcsec of m32 can be fit with an r@xmath85 law ( e.g. choi et al .",
    "2002 ) . the effective radius , r@xmath86 , and surface brightness , @xmath87 , obtained by fitting an r@xmath85 law to the wircam and spitzer images are listed in table 1 .",
    "the r@xmath86 measurements made by kent ( 1987 ) and choi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) at visible / red wavelengths are also listed for comparison .",
    "the errors in r@xmath86 are @xmath88 random uncertainties that reflect the scatter about the fitted relation .",
    "systematic effects , which are not included in the error estimates , have the potential to introduce uncertainties that are much larger than the random errors .",
    "for example , choi et al . ( 2002 ) and kent ( 1987 ) measure r@xmath86 at similar wavelengths , but their results differ by 3 arcsec .",
    "this suggests that a more realistic total uncertainty in r@xmath86 may be @xmath89 arcsec , which is @xmath90 larger than the random uncertainties .",
    "still , it is encouraging that the r@xmath86 values measured in @xmath1 , [ 3.6 ] , and [ 4.5 ] agree within their random uncertainties , while the [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] r@xmath86 measurements agree with the r@xmath86 measured in the @xmath91 filter by kent ( 1987 ) at the @xmath82 level .",
    "given the uncertainties in r@xmath86 , the entries in table 1 suggest that r@xmath86 is constant with wavelength , at least to within a few arcsec . the spatial distribution of the components that dominate the light at visible wavelengths , which includes a substantial contribution from main sequence stars , is thus not greatly different from the spatial distribution of the red stars that contribute significantly to the unresolved nir and mir light .",
    "additional insights into the evolution of m32 can be gleaned from isophote shapes .",
    "the ellipticities measured from the wircam and spitzer images are compared with ellipticity measurements from table iii of kent ( 1987 ) in the middle panel of figure 15 .",
    "the error bars show @xmath88 uncertainties that reflect the scatter about the fitted ellipses .",
    "these are internal errors , and the point - to - point jitter in the eccentricity measurements in a given filter suggests that at large radii the actual uncertainties may be a few times larger than those computed by _",
    "ellipse_.    there are no systematic differences between the nir , mir and r - band ellipticities at radii @xmath92 arcsec . however , between 16 and 45 arcsec the r - band ellipticities consistently fall below those measured at longer wavelengths , suggesting that the nir and mir isophotes at these radii are flatter than at visible wavelengths . the uncertainties in the ellipticities computed by _ ellipse _ would have to be in error by almost an order of magnitude to overlap with the @xmath91 eccentricity measurements .",
    "in fact , the ellipticities measured in @xmath23 and @xmath1 from the wircam data agree with those obtained by peletier ( 1993 ) in the same filters , while the ellipticities measured by kent ( 1987 ) agree with those measured by choi et al .",
    "hence , the differences found here are consistent with other independent measurements .",
    "the ellipticity measurements suggest that at least some of the unresolved nir and mir light originates from objects that have a flatter distribution on the sky than the objects that dominate the light at shorter wavelengths .",
    "such a distribution is suggestive of a disk , and evidence of a disk in the outermost regions of m32 has been found by choi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and graham ( 2002 ) .",
    "the coefficient of the fourth order cosine term in the fourier expansion of the isophotes is a sensitive indicator of isophote shape ( e.g. carter 1978 ) . if this coefficient @xmath93 then the isophote is  boxy , whereas if it is @xmath94 then the isophote is ` disky ' .",
    "the fourth order cosine coefficients",
    " b4  measured from the nir and mir data are plotted in the lower panel of figure 15 .",
    "the b4 values typically have only modest departures from zero , and to suppress random errors the points that are plotted in the lower panel of figure 15 are the averages of coefficients from three adjacent isophotes .",
    "the entries in the lower panel of figure 15 indicate that when @xmath5 arcsec the b4 coefficient tends to be predominantly negative , indicating a boxy morphology .",
    "however , at larger radii there is a higher incidence of positive b4 values .",
    "the mean b4 values at @xmath5 arcsec and at @xmath6 arcsec are compared in table 2 , and it is evident that b4 changes with radius in @xmath23 , [ 3.6 ] , and [ 4.5 ] .",
    "in fact , ( 1 ) the mean b4 entries in these filters in a given radial interval all agree , and ( 2 ) at @xmath6 arcsec the b4 coefficient in these filters exceeds zero at the @xmath82 or greater level .",
    "still , the b4 measurements made from the @xmath28 images differ from those in the other three filters . those measurements notwithstanding , the b4 values from the other three filters provide tantalizing evidence that the structural properties of m32 when @xmath5 arcsec is different from that at @xmath6 arcsec .",
    "the center of m32 samples the deepest part of the gravitational potential well , and so may harbor signatures of past events that shaped its evolution .",
    "the angular resolution of the niri @xmath95 and @xmath31 observations allow the light distribution near the center of m32 to be investigated on spatial scales @xmath96 parsec .",
    "the central regions of m32 have been examined previously at sub - arcsec resolutions , although not at wavelengths @xmath97 m .",
    "lauer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and corbin et al .",
    "( 2001 ) find no evidence of radial color variations in the visible and nir , while peletier ( 1993 ) and davidge ( 2000 ) find that the narrow - band co index in m32 may strengthen with decreasing radius in the central 3 arcsec .",
    "the @xmath70 and @xmath30 niri observations were smoothed to the angular resolution of the @xmath31 data , and the resulting light , color , and ellipticity profiles are shown in figure 16 .",
    "the central structural properties of m32 change substantially over small angular scales , and subtle variations in the character of the outer wings of the psf may significantly affect colors in these regions .",
    "therefore , no effort is made to examine the isophotal properties of the central 0.2 arcsec of m32 .",
    "the light profiles in the top panel of figure 16 have similar slopes , and the @xmath98 and @xmath99 colors are more - or - less constant .",
    "the ellipticities measured from the @xmath70 and @xmath30 images are similar out to 1.3 arcsec . however , between 0.5 and 0.7 arcsec the @xmath31 ellipticities fall below those in @xmath70 and @xmath30 .",
    "while the centroiding of the individual @xmath31 images was subject to @xmath100 arcsec jitter ( section 2 ) , this can not explain the dispersion in ellipticities at these radii .",
    "uncertainties due to centroiding errors were assessed by conducting simulations involving a mock @xmath31 image that was constructed using the isohophotal analysis of the actual @xmath31 image . as the final @xmath31 science image was the result of median - combining 35 individual images ,",
    "this mock image was replicated 35 times , with each replicant randomly offset by @xmath100 arcsec in radius .",
    "the 35 images with simulated image jitter were then median - combined , and @xmath101 was run on the result .",
    "a number of such realizations were run , and a comparison of the ellipticities measured from all of these indicates that a @xmath100 arcsec centroiding error introduces @xmath102 error in the ellipticities at a radius of 0.2 arcsec , and @xmath103 error at 0.4 arcsec .",
    "uncertainties in image centroiding thus can not explain the difference between the @xmath31 and shorter wavelength ellipticity measurements near 0.5 arcsec radius .",
    "it would be of interest to obtain additional images near @xmath12 m to investigate further the mir ellipticities between 0.5 and 0.7 arcsec .",
    "the isohotal properties of the @xmath70 and @xmath30 images , with the @xmath70 image smoothed to the angular resolution of the @xmath30 image , are compared in figure 17 .",
    "the angular resolution of the data used to construct figure 17 is thus 0.2 arcsec , as opposed to the 0.4 arcsec resolution of the data used for figure 16 .",
    "the @xmath70 and @xmath30 surface brightness profiles have similar slopes , and this is reflected in the flat @xmath98 profile , shown in the middle panel .",
    "the @xmath70 and @xmath30 ellipticity measurements are also similar at radii @xmath104 arcsec .",
    "the tendency for ellipticity to decrease at radii @xmath105 arcsec is likely due  at least in part  to seeing effects ( e.g. erwin & sparke 2003 ) .",
    "the comparisons in figures 16 and 17 indicate that the ` stubborn normalcy ' in stellar content near the center of m32 noted by lauer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) is evident at angular resolutions 0.2  0.4 arcsec in the nir and mir .",
    "the stellar content of the local group ce galaxy m32 has been investigated using ground and space - based images that span the @xmath0 m wavelength region .",
    "a goal of this study is to use m32 as a foil to consider the utility of mir observations for investigating the stellar contents of more distant galaxies .",
    "m32 is a favorable target for checking models and developing techniques that might be applied to trace the evolution of more distant galaxies as it is relatively nearby , allowing stars near the msto to be resolved , and has been extensively studied .",
    "it is demonstrated that accounting for the lpv nature of bright agb stars in m32 is an essential element of successfully modelling the nir and mir photometric properties of these objects . in the current study",
    "this has been done by convolving model lfs with an amplitude distribution that is based on galactic lpvs .",
    "while variability smooths out features in the lf , it does not completely obliterate information that can be used to probe the sfh .",
    "indeed , the overall shape of the smoothed [ 5.8 ] lf can be used to investigate the contributions made by stars with intermediate and old ages .",
    "comparisons between the nir and mir lfs and models constructed from the bressan et al .",
    "( 2012 ) sequences indicate that m32 is not a ssp , and must contain an old , metal - rich stellar component .",
    "model @xmath1 and [ 5.8 ] lfs that assume the sfh found by monachesi et al .",
    "( 2012 ) match the observations in both filters .",
    "the potential limitations imposed by stellar variability notwithstanding , the results in this paper indicate that observations of more distant systems in the mir , such as those that will be conducted with facilities such as the jwst , will prove useful for constraining the fraction of old and intermediate age stars in galaxies where other moderately bright age indicators , such as core helium burning stars , can not be resolved .",
    "it would be of interest to investigate the nir and mir lfs of local group galaxies that contain agb stars with ages and/or metallicities that differ from those in m32 .",
    "models predict that the rate of mass loss on the upper agb , and hence the size of circumstellar envelopes , depends on progenitor mass and metallicity ( e.g. bowen & willson 1991 ) , although there is still not extensive observational evidence to support a metallicity - dependence ( e.g. lagadec 2010 ) .",
    "the models predict that more massive , metal - rich agb stars will have thicker , dustier circumstellar envelopes than less massive , more metal - poor objects , and the former are expected to be brighter in the mir than the latter . hence , a different fraction of the mir light might be expected to originate from circumstellar sources in galaxies with mean metallicities that differ from that of m32 .",
    "we close the paper by briefly considering the origins of m32 , as the analysis of the nir and mir data provides information that is relevant to this issue .",
    "the nir and mir images suggest that m32 may be structurally complex .",
    "the isophotal analysis discussed in section 6 reveals a flattened structure in the unresolved nir and mir light that can be traced to within 16 arcsec of the galaxy center .",
    "the coefficient of the fourth order cosine expansion of the mir isophotes is also indicative of a disky morphology at @xmath6 arcsec .",
    "these results are interesting given that graham ( 2002 ) and choi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) find evidence for a diffuse disk - like distribution in the outer regions of m32 .",
    "if a disk is present then clues to its origins will be found in its stellar content .",
    "for example , a diffuse remnant of a once - larger progenitor disk might be expected to show a sfh that was truncated at the time of the events that disrupted the disk , and there might be evidence for elevated galaxy - wide star - forming activity . on the other hand , a diffuse disk that formed during cosmologically recent epochs from the accretion of high angular momentum gas that was able to cool and",
    "form stars might show a star - forming history that is distinct from the main body of the galaxy , and that continued to relatively recent epochs .",
    "the changes in structural characteristics found here are not accompanied by an obvious radial change in stellar content .",
    "there are no large - scale gradients in absorption line strengths in m32 , although fortuitous gradients in age and metallicity that conspire to negate absorption line gradients can not be ruled out ( davidge 1991 ; worthey 2004 ; rose et al .",
    "while in section 4 it is shown that there is a radial gradient in the mean @xmath43 color of the m32 agb sequence , this trend is consistent with progressively larger fractional contamination from stars in the outer disk of m31 towards larger distances from the center of m32 , rather than a gradient in  say ",
    "mean metallicity within m32 .",
    "more rigorous constraints on stellar content variations are placed by the specific frequency of bright agb stars , which does not vary with radius out to very large radii when normalized according to either visible or nir surface brightnesses ( davidge & jensen 2007 ) . the peak @xmath106 m brightness of agb stars in m32 also does not change over offsets from 2 arcsec to 176 arcsec from the galaxy center ( section 4 ) , underscoring previous studies at shorter wavelengths that have found that the brightest agb stars are distributed throughout the galaxy .",
    "if there is a diffuse disk around m32 then it has a stellar content that is not greatly different from that of the underlying body of the galaxy .",
    "could m32 be a fossil remnant of a major merger ?",
    "hammer et al .",
    "( 2010 ) investigate the possibility of a major merger between m31 and another galaxy a few gyr in the past .",
    "in addition to producing multiple tidal features around m31 , such an event can also explain episodes of elevated star formation that are evident in the age distribution of m31 globular clusters ( e.g. puzia et al .",
    "2005 ) , and the diverse nature of the m31 globular cluster system ( e.g. beasley et al .",
    "it has been demonstrated in this paper that the nir and mir photometric properties of agb stars in m32 are consistent with significant extended periods of star - forming activity in m32 during intermediate epochs , and this is in qualitative agreement with the interaction modelled by hammer et al .",
