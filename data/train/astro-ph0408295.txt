    "the spectroscopy modeling analysis and reduction tool ( smart ) is a software package written in idl for the analysis of data acquired with the infrared spectrograph(irs ) on the spitzer space telescope @xcite .",
    "the code has been developed for the unix / linux operating systems .",
    "the irs comprises four separate spectrograph modules covering the wavelength range from 5.3 to 38 @xmath0 m  with spectral resolutions , r @xmath1 and 600 .",
    "the modules are named after their wavelength coverage and resolution as short - low ( sl ) , short - high ( sh ) , long - low ( ll ) and long - high(lh ) .",
    "the sl includes two peak - up imaging cameras that have band - passes centered at 16 @xmath0 m  ( `` blue '' ) and 22 @xmath0 m  ( `` red '' ) . for details of the irs instrument see @xcite and chapter 7 of the spitzer observers manual(som7 ) .",
    "smart has been designed specifically for irs data and in particular to extract spectra from observations of faint or extended sources .",
    "it has been written with an understanding of both the available spitzer irs observing modes and a knowledge of how the contents of various files generated by the spitzer science center ( ssc ) irs pipeline can be used to maximize the signal - to - noise in the extracted spectrum .",
    "these three design factors make it a comprehensive and powerful software package for the extraction and analysis of irs data .",
    "smart is primarily intended to operate on the basic calibrated data ( bcd , see som7 ) delivered by the ssc pipeline , but will also operate on the browse quality data ( bqd , including both images and wavelength and flux calibrated spectral tables ) and 2-d data products from intermediate stages of the ssc pipeline , for example , the un - flatfielded data .",
    "smart aims to provide the routines necessary for the processing and scientific analysis of irs data .",
    "the main goal is to simplify the tasks of visualizing , organizing , optimally combining and extracting data .",
    "the result of this processing are fully flux and wavelength calibrated spectra .",
    "further analysis is available within smart .",
    "additionally , the spectra can be easily exported ( in either fits , ascii or idl save set format ) to other analysis packages written , for example , in idl or iraf .",
    "smart includes software developed by two of the spitzer legacy teams .",
    "the molecular cores to planet - forming disks ( c2d ) team has developed a code to remove fringes caused by interference in the detector substrate material @xcite .",
    "this software is an enhanced version of the code developed for the infrared space observatory ( iso ) short wavelength spectrometer @xcite .",
    "the formation and evolution of planetary systems ( feps ) team have adapted the idp3-nicmos package @xcite to analyze image data from the irs peak - up cameras .",
    "the spectral analysis code is based on the inherited iso spectral analysis package ( isap)@xcite . the isap software is available at http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/iso/isap/isap.html    the present paper is as an introduction to smart .",
    "a smart web site at http://isc.astro.cornell.edu/smart/ serves as the repository for the full listing of all functions available in smart and details of the algorithms used .",
    "this website includes a comprehensive smart users guide ( sug ) and a set of data reduction recipes aimed at the new user .",
    "each recipe outlines the steps required to produce wavelength and flux calibrated spectra .",
    "both the website and the software will be publicly available in december 2004 . in the following section we introduce the main graphical user interfaces ( guis ) used for the interactive analysis of irs data and briefly",
    "describe the experienced user and batch - mode capabilities .",
    "before starting a smart analysis session the observers need to fetch their irs data from the spitzer archive .",
    "smart is designed to operate on the ssc pipeline basic calibrated data ( bcd ) fits files .",
    "a bcd is a calibrated , flatfielded 2-d image .",
    "the observer obtains a bcd image for each irs exposure ( for observing mode and pipeline details , see som7 ) .",
    "in addition to the bcd file smart also needs two associated files for each exposure .",
    "these files are the uncertainty data and the bad pixel mask .",
    "the bad pixel mask has a 16 bit integer assigned to each pixel .",
    "each bit corresponds to a given warning / error condition detected during the pipeline processing .",
    "for example a pixel may have suffered a cosmic ray hit or may be saturated .",
    "a perl script searches the local directory for these 3 files and builds a new fits file ( ` * bcd3p.fits ' ) for each exposure .",
    "each new fits file contains the data plane and two extensions : the uncertainty plane and the bad pixel mask plane .",
    "ssc pipeline products are read into the project manager and either proceed directly or via image analysis into the isap - based data evaluation and analysis gui ( idea ) .",
    "figure 1 presents a flow chart outlining the main graphical user interfaces ( guis ) available in smart . at first glance",
    "some of the guis may appear complex , but we remind the reader that the sug will be available at the smart website .    figures 2a & 2b show the project manager and dataset guis .",
    "these form the base for launching different applications and storing the resulting data products .",
    "the project manager allows the spitzer observer to load files by browsing a local directory containing the 2-d images and spectral table files from the archive or import files from an existing local data base .",
    "it is designed to handle large data sets by grouping them into sets called `` projects '' .",
    "bcds within one project may or may not come from the same irs module or astronomical target .",
    "for example , consider the simple case of a low - resolution observation of a point source covering the full wavelength range ( 5.3 @xmath2 38 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "this requires the use of both the sl and ll modules .",
    "each module covers its nominal spectral range in two orders via two sub - slits .",
    "the default observing mode will obtain two spectra of the target source per sub - slit resulting in eight separate exposures .",
    "the resulting spectra from this observation would consist of two sets of four spectra from 5.2 - 8.7 @xmath0 m  ( sl2 ) , 7.4 - 14.5 @xmath0 m  ( sl1 ) , 14.0 - 21.3 @xmath0 m  ( ll2 ) and 19.5 - 38.0 @xmath0 m  ( ll2 ) of the target source .",
    "the irs low resolution observations always obtain data simultaneously in the two sub - slits , so there are an additional two sets of four spectra , with the same wavelength coverage as above , of the background sky .",
    "entire projects can be saved to disk as idl save sets , which can be imported into new smart projects .",
    "alternatively individual files can be exported from the project to disk in either fits or ascii table format .",
    "the main applications launched from the project manager are described in the following sections .",
    "we have enhanced a version of the image display program atv , to work with our irs spectral 2-d images .",
    "the atv code was developed to visualize both 2-d and 3-d images @xcite .",
    "figure 3 shows an example of data displayed in atv - irs .",
    "we have enhanced the code so that an over - plot tracing the curved spectral orders and the boundaries of the individual resolution elements can be displayed .",
    "the cursor position is reported in terms of pixel position ( x , y ) and flux ( pixel value ) as well as sky coordinates ( right ascension , declination ) and spectral wavelength .",
    "this is very useful for assessing whether weak features in a spectrum are emission lines or are caused by cosmic - ray hits to the detectors .",
    "the viewer can also display the uncertainty and bad pixel mask planes , returning the same information for the cursor position .",
    "additional pixels may be flagged at this stage by editing the bad pixel mask .",
    "in addition to displaying a single bcd , one can make a movie of a stack of images or make a single mosaiced image .",
    "a table containing the pixel information can also be inspected .",
    "if a stack of images is selected the statistics on the cube of pixel data can be displayed in a table .",
    "images from an external archive can also be added to the project manager and viewed in atv - irs .",
    "the image display paradigm 3 ( idp3 ) is a sophisticated photometry software package .",
    "it is written in idl and is designed for the analysis of the hubble nicmos data .",
    "the irs has imaging capabilities provided by the two peak - up cameras , each with an @xmath3 1 arcmin@xmath4 field of view .",
    "the blue irs peak - up camera fills a gap in the wavelength coverage of the spitzer imagers at 16 @xmath0 m .",
    "both the red ( 22 @xmath0 m ) and blue cameras are used for many observations .",
    "elizabeth stobie at the university of arizona provided a modified version of idp3 , known as idp3-irs , which is optimized for analyzing sources observed with the irs peak - up mode .",
    "quick look takes a bcd file and collapses the spectral orders along the dispersion direction to produce an average intensity profile across the source .",
    "this provides a convenient tool to search for either extended emission or weak secondary point sources in the low resolution data , which have slits that are 57 @xmath5 ( sl ) and 168 @xmath5 ( ll ) in the cross - dispersion direction .",
    "figure 4 shows an example of a serendipitous detection of a weak source located close to the slit center in ll1 .",
    "the negative stripes in ll2 are caused by the sky subtraction in ll1 using data which has the target source in ll2 , see section 2.4 for a discussion of sky subtraction .",
    "the standard image operations - averaging , median filtering , division , addition and subtraction - are available in smart .",
    "in addition to operations weighted by the uncertainty data , pixels can be discarded according to their bad pixel mask value .",
    "this offers a powerful means for discarding corrupted data and improving the signal to noise .",
    "for example , consider the median of ten bcds .",
    "first the pixels flagged by a bad pixel mask value are excluded from the calculation of the median value for each pixel in the 128x128 array .",
    "a new bad pixel mask is generated for the median data using the or operator on all the bad pixel mask values associated with the data used to estimate the median .",
    "automatic co - adding and differencing are available for sl and ll data .",
    "the images are sorted by slit and position within the slit ( i.e. , nod position ) and then co - added .",
    "the co - added `` on - source '' and `` off - source '' images may then be differenced .",
    "there are currently four extraction routines available in smart .",
    "all methods use a look - up table supplied by the ssc , which traces the spectral orders on the bcd image .",
    "this table is converted into an idl structure known as the `` wavesamp '' .",
    "the extraction routines use the wavesamp in order to sub - set the relevant group of pixels in each resolution element on the array .",
    "an example of the wavesamp trace is shown in figure 3 , where the curved spectral order has been sub - divided into spectral resolution elements .",
    "the curvature results in fractional pixels being assigned to a given resolution element .",
    "the value of each fractional pixel is scaled by its geometrical area .",
    "the bcd data is in units of electron / sec .",
    "each routine estimates the total number of electron / sec in each individual resolution element .",
    "the final step is to apply the flux calibration ( i.e. , electron / sec to janskys ) and stitch the orders together into a single spectrum , using the pipeline `` fluxcon '' tables .",
    "this is the standard extraction method for sh and lh data .",
    "it can also be used for extended objects that fill the sl and ll apertures .",
    "the pixel values in each resolution element , as defined by the wavesamp , are summed , while accounting for fractional pixels .",
    "prior to extraction , pixel values set to nan ( not a number ) in the pipeline or flagged by the bad pixel mask are replaced with an average value , which is estimated from the values of the pixels in the same resolution element as the bad pixel .      for sl and ll observations of point sources",
    "the standard extraction method is column extraction .",
    "a column of pixels centered on the point source is extracted .",
    "figure 5 is an example of the aperture used for a column extraction in ll2 .",
    "the column traces the spectral order and its width in the cross - dispersion direction is scaled with the instrumental point spread function .",
    "the user should over - ride the default width only after careful consultation of the manual and help pages ( see http://isc.astro.cornell.edu/smart/ ) .",
    "the user defined width is scaled with wavelength , and requires additional `` on - the - fly '' calibration , see section 3 .",
    "the pixels in the column in each resolution element are summed , while accounting for fractional pixels .",
    "prior to extraction pixel values set to nan or flagged by bad pixel mask values are replaced with an average value , which is estimated from the pixels in the column within the same resolution element as the bad pixel .",
    "a column of pixels centered on the extended source is extracted .",
    "the column traces the spectral order and its width is constant with wavelength . again",
    ", the pixels in each resolution element within the column are summed , while accounting for fractional pixels .",
    "pixel values set to nan or flagged by bad pixel mask values are replaced using the method outlined above for column extraction .",
    "gaussian extraction should only be used with care as it requires additional on - the - fly calibration , see section 3 .",
    "the data from the pixels in each individual resolution element are collapsed in the dispersion direction .",
    "the resulting 1-d trace is fit with a gaussian profile .",
    "the gaussian center and width can be frozen to aid the extraction of weak sources .",
    "pixel values set to nan or flagged by bad pixel mask values are excluded from the fit .",
    "the bcd images include sky emission and possible detector artifacts , which can be removed in smart .",
    "the first method is applied before extraction and the remaining two methods are akin to removing a baseline before measuring a line flux .",
    "if no sky image data are available a zodiacal model can be subtracted from the spectra in idea .",
    "the sky emission is removed by differencing an `` on - source '' and `` super - sky '' image prior to extraction .",
    "a super - sky image can be created by co - adding multiple `` off - source '' ( i.e. , sky ) bcds together .",
    "this can be done in smart using either the image operations gui or using one of the available scripts .",
    "this method is applicable to all four modules . for low resolution data",
    "the `` super - sky '' image may simply be the median of the `` off - source data '' , which is acquired as part of the standard staring mode observation . for high resolution data",
    "separate sky observations are required .",
    "the sky emission is removed during the extraction process .",
    "an `` off - source '' bcd is used for the sky estimate .",
    "this can be done in two ways .",
    "the first method calculates the median sky pixel value in each resolution element of the off - source bcd . in the second method ,",
    "the pixel values in each resolution element of the off - source bcd are plotted as a function of cross - dispersion distance from the center of the slit .",
    "a first - order polynomial is fit to the resulting intensity profile to estimate the sky level . for full aperture extraction",
    "the sky value is scaled with the area of the resolution element . for column extraction the sky value",
    "is scaled to the area of the column with in a given resolution element .",
    "for gaussian extraction the sky value is scaled to the width of the gaussian .",
    "the scaled sky value is then subtracted from each respective summed resolution element , column or integrated gaussian profile in the source spectrum .",
    "the single - sky methods are applied to the data .",
    "however in this instance the sky is calculated from the same bcd that contains the source data .",
    "the pixels in a given resolution element that are not part of the source column or gaussian are used to estimate the sky value .",
    "an example of a selection of suitable sky regions is shown in figure 5 .",
    "idea , the isap - based data evaluation and analysis program , is a comprehensive 1-d spectral analysis package .",
    "the code includes the inherited isap software .",
    "isap was developed for the analysis of spectral data from iso ( sws / lws / pht - s / cam - cvf ) and provides a wealth of routines embedded in an easy - to - use graphical environment .",
    "the ability to analyse iso spectra has been preserved so that direct comparisons may be made between data from the two satellites .",
    "figure 6a shows the idea gui , which has been enhanced to fit the special needs of irs data .",
    "the applications gui is shown in figure 6b .",
    "processing routines include shifting , zapping low signal - to - noise or corrupted data , defringing , re - binning , unit conversion , combining spectra with weighted means or medians , filtering and smoothing .",
    "analysis routines include line fitting , line identification , continuum - fitting , synthetic photometry ( including the iras , iso and spitzer filter profiles ) , zodiacal light modeling , blackbody fitting , de - reddening and template fitting routines .",
    "the spectra can be imported / exported as fits , idl save sets or ascii tables .",
    "smart is supplied with a default set of calibration files from the ssc , which can be inspected in the calibration gui .",
    "however the experienced user can create her / his own set of calibration files and import them into smart via the calibration gui .",
    "the extraction routines can be tailored to specific source profiles to maximize the signal to noise .",
    "intermediate pipeline products , for example , the un - flatfielded data , can be substituted for the bcd image files .",
    "this can be beneficial for the extraction of faint sources and sources that have weak features .",
    "when un - flatfielded data are used the flux calibration is performed on - the - fly using a default set of calibration sources .",
    "both the target and the flux calibrator are extracted using the same parameters .",
    "the extracted calibration source is then used to flux calibrate the extracted target spectrum .",
    "only an experienced user should over - ride the default calibration file selection .",
    "smart is also designed for efficient batch mode processing .",
    "many of the gui functions are available in batch mode and we are developing a suite of scripts for the most commonly used functions .",
    "for example , both full aperture , column and gaussian extraction are available in batch mode .",
    "the script includes two sky removal options .",
    "the first option is to subtract the sky during extraction .",
    "alternatively , the sky can be removed using the super - sky method .",
    "the data from a given slit and nod position are co - added and then the co - added `` on - source '' and `` off - source '' images are differenced .",
    "a single spectrum is then extracted from the median filtered , sky - subtracted image .",
    "smart is currently being tested by the irs team and the participating legacy teams . in december 2004",
    "we will have a public release of smart .",
    "the code will be available at our website , http://isc.astro.cornell.edu/smart/ , where the irs observer can find detailed instructions for downloading and installing smart .",
    "the site includes a smart users guide and recipes for reducing irs data .",
    "we plan to update and add new functionality to the code as our understanding of the irs data analysis evolves .",
    "for example , we are currently working on an optimized extraction algorithm for both high and low resolution data .",
    "updates will be posted at the web site .",
    "we would like to thank the following people , the irs team and the ssc for their dedicated work in generating the pipeline processed data and for ongoing calibration work ; the isap team for allowing us to inherit and modify the isap code and the referee , eckhard sturm , for his swift endorsement of this paper .",
    "this work is based [ in part ] on observations made with the spitzer space telescope , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology under nasa contract 1407 .",
    "support for this work was provided by nasa through contract number 1257184 issued by jpl / caltech .",
