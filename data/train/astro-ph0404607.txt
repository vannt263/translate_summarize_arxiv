    "while the operation of the solar dynamo is still far from understood ( @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) , it is now generally believed that the strong toroidal magnetic field responsible for solar activity is generated and stored in the tachocline layer .",
    "this transitional layer between the differentially rotating convective zone ( cz ) and the rigidly rotating solar interior is characterized by a strong radial shear , and is thus an ideal candidate for the production of the toroidal field .",
    "the site and physical nature of the toroidal@xmath0poloidal flux conversion ( @xmath1-effect ) , needed to close the cycle , is much less clear .",
    "one popular possibility is the interface dynamo ( @xcite @xcite  hereafter p93,@xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) where @xmath1 is concentrated in the deepest part of the cz , immediately above the layer of strong shear .",
    "helioseismic inversions ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) indicate that at low latitudes the solar tachocline lies immediately below the adiabatically stratified cz .",
    "this implies that the turbulent diffusivity in the tachocline is significantly suppressed in comparison to the layers immediately above it , resembling the situation envisaged in interface dynamo models .",
    "an attractive feature of these models is that the sharp diffusivity contrast between the two layers gives rise to quite strong toroidal magnetic fields , in agreement with the requirements of flux emergence calculations . if the sign of @xmath1 is negative on the northern hemisphere , as expected near the bottom of the cz , then the parker ",
    "yoshimura sign rule predicts an equatorward propagating dynamo wave at low latitudes and a poleward propagating wave at high latitudes , with the two belts departing at the corotation latitude of @xmath2 .",
    "it is tempting to identify these waves with the two well known branches of the extended butterfly diagram ( e.g.@xcite @xcite ; cf .",
    "also @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of a meridional circulation , however , significantly complicates the picture . as a poleward meridional flow of amplitude @xmath3@xmath4 m/s",
    "is clearly detected in the shallower layers of the cz ( @xcite @xcite ) , continuity seems to require a counterflow in the deep cz ( though a two - cell pattern is at present also not excluded ) .",
    "as this velocity amplitude is comparable to the speed of migration of the activity belts , the question arises whether the meridional flow can invalidate the parker  yoshimura sign rule , reversing the propagation of a dynamo wave .",
    "indeed , in flux transport models of the solar dynamo ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) , a deep equatorward meridional flow is responsible for the migration of sunspot - forming latitudes during the solar cycle .    as the effect of a homogeneous flow",
    "can obviously be described by a galilean transformation of the solution with no flow , it is indeed to be expected that an equatorward meridional flow pervading the whole dynamo region near the bottom of the cz ( as assumed in flux transport models ) will reverse the poleward propagation of the dynamo wave if its speed is higher than the phase velocity .",
    "( in these models , @xmath1 is concentrated near the surface and is positive in the northern hemisphere , leading to poleward propagation at low latitudes hence the need for a reversal . )",
    "the actual situation is , however , more complex , as a meridional flow of significant amplitude can not be expected to penetrate below the adiabatically stratified cz .",
    "the strong subadiabatic stratification of the tachocline represents a serious obstacle in the way of meridional circulation .",
    "the timescale of any meridional flow here can not be shorter than the ( turbulent ) heat diffusion timescale , allowing downmoving fluid elements to get rid of their strong buoyancy .",
    "heat diffusivity in the subadiabatic layer is clearly much lower than above , so the same must be true for the amplitude of the poloidal flow .",
    "a more realistic representation of the meridional flow pattern in the dynamo layer , then , is an interface - type model with no meridional flow in the strongly sheared , low - diffusivity lower layer , and a homogeneous meridional flow in the highly diffusive upper layer .",
    "this paper addresses the problem of how a meridional flow influences the properties of the dynamo wave by considering the arguably simplest nontrivial case : the effect of a homogeneous meridional flow in the top layer of parker s interface dynamo .",
    "section 2 describes the analytic model , section 3 presents some solutions for important special cases .",
    "finally , in section 4 the implications of our findings are discussed for the problems outlined above .",
    "our model is a generalization of parker s cartesian interface dynamo ( p93 ) .",
    "the model describes dynamo activity occurring in two adjacent layers , say @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "this cartesian model can be considered a local approximation of the true spherical system , with the @xmath7 and @xmath8 coordinates corresponding to colatitude and longitude , respectively .",
    "the magnetic field is written in the form @xmath9 while the zonal flow is written in terms of a shear rate @xmath10 : @xmath11 the parameters are homogeneously distributed in each layer , and change discontinuously across the interface . in the upper part , we assume @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , while in the lower part , we have @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "( here and in what follows , the indices @xmath19 and @xmath20 refer to values in the @xmath6 and @xmath5 sublayers , respectively . )",
    "the @xmath21-dynamo equations in the two layers read @xmath22 @xmath23 with the appropriate boundary conditions ensuring conservation of magnetic flux applied at the interface ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "following p93 , the solution of equations ( [ eq : poldynamo ] ) and ( [ eq : tordynamo ] ) is now sought in the form @xmath25   \\\\ & \\\\ b_\\downarrow= ( l+mz)\\,\\exp(\\sigma t+sz)\\,\\exp[i(\\omega t+kx+qz ) ]   \\\\ & \\\\ a_\\uparrow= ( d+ez)\\,\\exp(\\sigma t - sz)\\,\\exp[i(\\omega t+kx - qz ) ]   \\\\ & \\\\",

    ", we find the complex dispersion relation @xmath29 \\nonumber\\\\ & & -z^2\\mu^2[(\\mu^2 - 1-ir)^3+i(1+\\mu^2)(\\mu^2 - 1-ir)n ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\mu^4n^2/16=0 , \\label{eq : disp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath30 . by separating equation ( [ eq : disp ] ) into real and imaginary parts ,",
    "one arrives at the dispersion relations to be solved for the real quantities @xmath31 and @xmath32 . while these relations can be given in a closed form , they are rather lengthy and awkward to handle in the general case . however , the dispersion relations simplify significantly for some important special cases . in",
    "what follows , we will consider each of these cases in turn .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the dispersion relation ( [ eq : disp ] ) now simplify to @xmath34 @xmath35 multiplying equation ( [ eq : mu1disp1 ] ) by @xmath36 and equation ( [ eq : mu1disp2 ] ) by @xmath37 , and taking the difference we have @xmath38 from this , for the frequency @xmath32 we have the explicit result @xmath39 while for the growth rate @xmath40 we a quadratic equation in @xmath41 : @xmath42    in figure  [ fig : mu1 ] , the wave period @xmath43 , the phase speed @xmath28 , and the growth rate @xmath40 , computed from relations ( [ eq : mu1nu ] ) and ( [ eq : mu1beta ] ) , are plotted for @xmath44 .",
    "the critical dynamo number for @xmath45 is @xmath46 , so this corresponds to a moderately supercritical case .",
    "it is apparent that for high negative values of @xmath47 the phase speed becomes slightly negative , indicating that the dynamo wave is reversed .",
    "nevertheless , the minimal flow speed needed for this , @xmath48 , is significantly higher in modulus than the phase speed for @xmath45 ( @xmath49 ) , in contrast to the case of a uniform flow .",
    "this confirms that with the nonuniform flow considered here the properties of the dynamo differ significantly from the case of a uniform flow that simply advects the dynamo wave . in particular , the parker - yoshimura sign rule @xmath50 that determines the sense of dynamo wave propagation when @xmath45 , is not as easy to violate as in the case of a uniform flow .",
    "this is further borne out in figure  [ fig : turnaround ] , where the wedge - shaped region marked `` reverse wave '' denotes that portion of the @xmath36-@xmath47 plane in which the sign rule is violated . for a uniform flow ,",
    "this region should clearly extend down to the dotted line indicating the negative of the phase speed in the @xmath45 case .",
    "it is apparent that the growth rate is maximal for @xmath45 , and otherwise independent of the direction of the flow ( as only even powers of @xmath47 appear in equation [ [ eq : mu1beta ] ] ) .",
    "this symmetric behaviour of the @xmath51 curve is , however , specific to the case @xmath33 . indeed , expanding the dispersion relation in terms of @xmath52 and @xmath47 around the case @xmath53 , after considerable algebra one finds @xmath54 @xmath55 being the growth rate for @xmath53 . from this",
    "it is clear that for @xmath56 , in models with @xmath57 , the growth rate is increased by a finite negative @xmath47 , while with @xmath58 the reverse is true .",
    "we now turn to the case more relevant to the sun , when the shear layer is characterized by a lower value of the diffusivity than the layer above . again following p93",
    ", we consider the limit @xmath60 while @xmath61 remains finite , and restrict our attention to unstable modes with @xmath62 .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the dispersion relation ( [ eq : disp ] ) can then be written as @xmath63 + \\beta^2(\\beta-1)^2 \\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\beta r(\\beta r+{{\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}}}\\tilde",
    "n ) -{{\\textstyle\\frac{1}{16}}}{\\tilde n}^2 = 0 , \\label{eq : mu0disp1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath64[\\tilde n-8(\\nu+r)(\\beta-{{\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}}})+4\\beta r ] = 0 .",
    "\\label{eq : mu0disp2}\\ ] ] the latter relation implies that either @xmath65^{1/2}\\ } , \\label{eq : mu0nu}\\ ] ] or @xmath66 substituting either of the last two relations into ( [ eq : mu0disp1 ] ) yields the other , so by combining them we obtain a relation that gives the growth rate implicitly @xmath67^{1/2}\\}(\\beta-{{\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2 } } } ) -4\\beta r. \\label{eq : mu0beta}\\ ] ] upon solving this for @xmath31 , @xmath32 can be calculated from equation ( [ eq : mu0nu2 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath68 it is the @xmath69 sign , while for @xmath70 it is the @xmath71 sign that corresponds to growing modes in the case @xmath45 .",
    "the other sign will not lead to growing modes for any value of @xmath47 .",
    "the dependence of the wave period @xmath43 , the phase speed @xmath28 , and the growth rate @xmath40 on @xmath47 is plotted in figure  [ fig : mu0 ] for the growing mode ( @xmath71 sign ) , in a moderately supercritical case with a negative dynamo number .",
    "inspection of figure  [ fig : mu0 ] and , more importantly , the analysis of equations ( [ eq : mu0nu])-([eq : mu0beta ] ) also indicates that @xmath72 for all values of @xmath47 for growing modes ; that is , the sign rule ( [ eq : signrule ] ) seems to hold unconditionally in the limit considered here .",
    "indeed , while a parallel flow of relatively moderate speed @xmath73 ( @xmath74 in the case considered ) can quench the dynamo completely , an antiparallel flow ( @xmath75 ) can apparently neither quench the dynamo wave , nor turn it around , for any finite speed .",
    "however , a caveat is in order when applying these findings to the case of a small but finite @xmath76 .",
    "as the results were derived assuming @xmath62 , their applicability is limited to a limited range in @xmath47 , the limits of which are determined by the condition @xmath77 . however , from equation ( [ eq : mu0beta ] ) in the case of an antiparallel flow one finds the condition @xmath78 ( for @xmath70 ) , the order of magnitude of @xmath79 being at least 100 , much higher than any realistic estimate of @xmath47 in the solar case .",
    "thus we can safely conclude that _ in the case of high diffusivity contrast and meridional flow limited to the upper regime ( cz ) , a meridional flow can not reverse the direction of propagation of the dynamo wave , _ unless its amplitude is unrealistically high .",
    "we have studied by analytical methods how a meridional flow limited to the upper ( i.e.  unsheared ) layer affects kinematic interface dynamos .",
    "we found that the growth rate and period of the dynamo wave have a nontrivial dependence on the flow amplitude . in the case of",
    "strongly reduced diffusivity in the lower layer , relevant for the sun , a flow parallel to the direction of propagation of the dynamo wave reduces the growth rate until , at a finite critical flow speed , it completely suppresses dynamo action .",
    "an antiparallel flow , in contrast , first increases the growth rate ; then , after reaching a maximum , the growth rate tends to zero as @xmath80 .",
    "contrary to intuition , an antiparallel flow can neither suppress nor revert the direction of propagation of the dynamo wave .",
    "this conclusion is apparently at odds with flux transport models ( @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) where an equatorward flow near the bottom of the cz can turn the direction of propagation of the dynamo wave towards the equator at low latitudes .",
    "there is , however , no real contradiction here , as in those models the flow is assumed to penetrate quite deep into the layer of strong shear . in terms of the simple cartesian model studied here , a closer counterpart of the flux transport models would be a case with @xmath81const . throughout the region : then an antiparallel flow exceeding the phase speed can trivially turn around a dynamo wave . in section  1",
    "we argued that it is more realistic to assume that the meridional flow is limited to the adiabatic upper layer .",
    "in fact , the more recent flux transport model of @xcite admits that the circulation must be limited to the adiabatic layer .",
    "therefore , in order to make the model work , they need to assume that a significant fraction of the tachocline overlaps the adiabatic scz .",
    "this may indeed hold at high latitudes , but at low latitudes , where a meridional transport of toroidal fields is most needed , it does not seem to be supported by helioseismic data ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "these arguments indicate that our simplified models may have more relevance to the solar dynamo than many complex nonlinear spherical models where the assumed geometrical distribution of the flows and transport coefficient does not reflect the situation in the solar interior .",
    "nevertheless , owing to the simplified 2d cartesian geometry and the kinematical nature of our models our conclusions should be taken with proper reservation . in this context",
    "it may be mentioned that that details of the physical structure , such as the precise form of the rotation law , were shown to have a profound effect on the behaviour of dynamo models ( @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "extensions of this work to spherical geometry and to the 3d nonlinear domain are clearly needed to tell whether the present results remain valid in more realistic situations .",
