    "the numerical simulation of the quantum dynamics of strongly correlated many - body systems is a topic of widespread and pronounced interest .",
    "such simulations represent a tough task in general due to the exponential scaling of the state space : taking an interacting @xmath0-particle system for example , and allowing each particle to occupy @xmath1 single particle states , the many - body hilbert space turns out to be @xmath2 dimensional for a system of distinguishable particles .",
    "when going to higher particle numbers , one , hence , has to truncate the hilbert space in one or another way .",
    "moreover , this scaling problem has serious consequences for the simulation of the dynamics : in the course of time , the system state will move through different subspaces of the total hilbert space in general . if one now tries to expand the systems state with respect to a time - independent basis ,",
    "many basis states will be needed in order to span the relevant subspace for the whole propagation time .",
    "so for reducing the number of basis vectors , one should better employ a time - dependent , moving basis , in which the instantaneous system state can be optimally represented .    in the multi - configuration time - dependent hartree method ( mctdh ) ,",
    "such a co - moving basis is provided by time - dependent hartree products @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion for the single particle functions ( spfs ) building up the time - dependent hartree products as well as for the expansion coefficients are obtained by means of the dirac - frenkel variation principle , which ensures a variationally optimal representation of the total wave function at any instant . using hartree products as the many - body basis states , mctdh is well suited for dealing with distinguishable particles . originally developed in the context of quantum molecular dynamics , mctdh has successfully been applied to an enormous diversity of problems concerning the vibrational and wave packet dynamics of molecules ( cf .",
    "@xcite and reference therein ) . moreover , mctdh turned out to be also powerful for simulating strongly correlated few - body systems of ultracold , indistinguishable bosonic atoms in traps , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "mctdh has been extended for dealing with higher particle numbers in several ways : in multi - layer mctdh ( ml - mctdh ) , degrees of freedom are combined to higher - dimensional ones .",
    "the mctdh expansion scheme is then applied to theses combined modes and their constituting degrees of freedom in a cascade @xcite .",
    "this scheme is particularly fruitful for scenarios where there are strong correlations within certain subsystems while the inter - subsystem correlations are relatively weak @xcite .",
    "especially , many system - bath problems are of this type . in such a situation",
    ", the necessary number of time - dependent basis functions can be reduced by combining the strongly correlated degrees of freedom in an ml - mctdh expansion . as mctdh , ml - mctdh",
    "is based on expansions in terms of hartree products and , thus , ignores possible particle exchange symmetries of the system . when considering an interacting bosonic bath , the resulting redundancies in the configuration space limit the feasible numbers of the indistinguishable degrees of freedom and spfs .",
    "in contrast to this , the mcdth method for fermions ( mctdhf ) and for bosons ( mctdhb ) reduce the number of expansion coefficients by expanding the total wave function in terms of slater determinants and permanents @xcite , respectively .",
    "mctdhf has been applied in the context of quantum chemistry as well as for molecules in strong laser fields @xcite .",
    "the crossover from the gross - pitaevskii to the many - body regime has been studied for several ultracold bosonic systems by means of mctdhb ( see ref . @xcite and the refs . therein ) .",
    "there is even a formalism , which unifies mctdhb and mctdhf for dealing , @xmath3 with bose - bose , bose - fermi and fermi - fermi mixtures @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an extension for considering particle conversion , @xmath4 chemical reactions , in a multi - species system has been developed @xcite .",
    "ml - mctdh features a high flexibility with respect to the wave function expansion : any way of combining degrees of freedom to higher dimensional ones in a cascade is allowed and leads to a specific wave function ansatz . as , in the case of indistinguishable particles , many of these mode - combination schemes do not reflect the indistinguishability of the particles , the particle exchange symmetry can , in general , not be incorporated in ml - mctdh , making ml - mctdh incompatible with mctdhb and mctdhf .",
    "there is , however , an exception : in @xcite , a second quantization representation of ml - mcdth ( ml - mctdh - sqr ) has been derived , which has been applied to charge transport problems @xcite , for example .",
    "the ml - mctdh - sqr method is based on the factorization of the fock space for @xmath5 single particle modes into @xmath5 sub - fock spaces corresponding to just one single particle mode each , which leads to the product structure required by ml - mctdh . by the virtue of this product structure ,",
    "the @xmath5 modes can be identified with the `` lower dimensional '' dof of a ml - mctdh setting and any mode combination of these dof to higher dimensional dof in a cascade becomes possible . in this way ,",
    "ml - mctdh - sqr benefits from the flexible cascade scheme of ml - mctdh while keeping the spf , constituting the fock states , time - independent .    in this work ,",
    "an alternative symbiosis employing the bosonic symmetry and a multi - layer ansatz is presented , in which the spfs of the bosons are time - dependent .",
    "the price one has to pay for this is that only two expansion schemes ( and any combination thereof ) are possible : ( i ) a multi - layer expansion with respect to the different bosonic species for optimally taking account inter- and intra - species correlations and ( ii ) a particle multi - layer expansion in which the single particle functions are further expanded in the mctdh form for efficiently simulating bosons in two- and three - dimensional traps .",
    "this method , termed multi - layer mctdhb ( ml - mctdhb ) , manifests itself as a numerically exact ab - initio tool for the quantum dynamics as well as stationary properties of bosonic ensembles consisting of arbitrary many species in various dimensions .",
    "this paper is devoted to the detailed derivation of the underlying theory , the description of the implementation , as well as the account of algorithmic features of the method .",
    "while ref @xcite contains a brief account of the theory of ml - mctdhb and focuses on its applications to the nonequilibrium quantum dynamics of mixtures of ultracold atoms , the present work provides the complete theoretical framework necessary for the reader to thoroughly understand and apply the theory .",
    "furthermore we provide relevant technical aspects , address the strategy of an efficient implementation and demonstrate the efficiency of ml - mctdhb by comparing the number of expansion coefficients with the existing methods such as mctdhb for bose - bose mixtures by applying it to some relevant example systems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec_theo ] , we introduce two different schemes of ml - mctdhb , the species ml - mctdhb ( in section [ subsec_species ] ) and the particle ml - mctdhb ( in section [ subsec_par ] ) , which are for bosonic mixtures and bosonic systems in high dimensions , respectively .",
    "the combination of these two schemes leading to the general ml - mctdhb theory is then introduced in [ subsec_intg ] . in section [ subsec_scaling ] and [ subsec_symm ] , we comment on the scaling property and the symmetry preservation of ml - mctdhb , respectively . in section [ sec_impl ]",
    "we discuss some details of the implementation of the method , including the implementation of the second quantization scheme ( [ subsec_ns ] ) and the applicabilities of the method ( [ subsec_app ] ) . in section [ sec_exampl ] ,",
    "the application of ml - mcdthb is illustrated by two examples .",
    "we conclude with a summary , discussing also an extension of ml - mctdhb to fermionic species in section [ sec_concl ] .",
    "ml - mctdhb is designed for the most general bosonic mixtures containing an arbitrary number of bosonic species , with all possible types of single particle potentials for each species as well as intra-/inter - species interaction potentials .",
    "the bosonic species can refer to different bosonic quasi - particles , chemical species , isotopes or atoms of the same element prepared in different hyperfine bosonic states , which have been widely realized in experiments @xcite .",
    "ml - mctdhb can treat bosons with various degrees of freedom ( dof ) , including one- to three - dimensional spatial dof as well as spatial plus internal ( e.g. the spinor ) dof .",
    "the hamiltonian of such bosonic mixtures can be expressed in the general form of @xmath6 the first term of the hamiltonian contains the single particle hamiltonian for all the bosons in each species with @xmath7 , and @xmath8 as well as @xmath9 refer to the kinetic energy and single particle potentials of the @xmath10 species bosons , respectively .",
    "particularly @xmath9 can be a spatial potential and also a spin - orbit coupling potential for bosons with spin dof .",
    "the second and third terms of equation ( [ ham_1st ] ) are the intra- and inter - species interactions .",
    "the intra-/inter - species interactions , @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively , can be of arbitrary form such as the contact interaction , the dipolar interaction or the coulomb interaction , which are widely studied in various physics and chemistry fields . in this work ,",
    "the interactions are restricted to the two - body interactions . moreover , since ml - mctdhb is a variational ab - initio method for the time - dependent schrdinger equation , all the potentials can be time - dependent in ml - mctdhb .",
    "ml - mctdhb applies a multi - layer ansatz for the bosonic mixture of arbitrary many species . to introduce the multi - layer ansatz",
    ", we consider a general bosonic mixture containing s species , and bosons of each species evolve in a fixed single particle hilbert space , which is spanned by a set of time - independent basis functions , @xmath3 , @xmath13 for the bosons of species @xmath10 , which we call @xmath10 bosons for brevity in the following .",
    "the hilbert space of the total system is chosen as the direct product of a given hilbert space of each species , as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 refer to the hilbert space of the total system and the @xmath10 species , respectively .",

    "a more efficient treatment of high - dimensional systems with ml - mctdhb will be introduced in the following section .",
    "let us summarize the species ml - mctdhb with the introduction of the tree diagram notation , in analogy to @xcite .",

    "the tree diagram is composed of various nodes and links connecting the nodes .",
    "the nodes in the tree refer to the primitive as well as logical dof , and the links indicate the expansion relation between corresponding dof . in figure [ tree_sketch ] , the top node refers to the state vector of the whole system @xmath17 , and it forms the top layer of the tree .",

    "one layer below , @xmath4 the third layer , is the particle layer , of which each node refers to a particle logical dof with the particle spfs @xmath46 . the nodes below the particle nodes relate to the primitive spatial dof , which are indicated inside boxes .",
    "it now becomes clear that a circle node refers to a logical dof associated with time - dependent basis vectors , and a square refers to a primitive dof associated with time - independent basis vectors .",
    "the links between nodes in adjacent layers refer to the expansions given in equations ( [ mlb_ansatz]-[par_spf ] ) , for instance , the three branches leading out of the top node correspond to the expansion of @xmath17 by equation ( [ mlb_ansatz ] ) .",
    "particularly , the multiple vertical lines linking the species and particle nodes indicate that the species node represents a logical dof to which many bosons rather than a single one are combined .",
    "the number given along each link denotes the number of spfs or primitive vectors of the node at the bottom side of the link . moreover",
    ", the + sign in the species node indicates the related node as a logical dof of a bosonic species , and the number on the left side of each species node indicates the number of bosons of this species . in this way",
    "the tree diagram offers the complete information of the ml - mctdhb ansatz , in a visualized manner , and the superscripts of the spfs and expansion coefficients , @xmath57 and @xmath58 indicate that the corresponding dof is the @xmath10-th node on the @xmath59-th layer .    , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",

    "the method can handle both the weak and strong correlation regimes , simply by adjusting the number of the spfs of related dof .",
    "for instance , when the intra- and inter - species interactions are weak , we can take few particle and species spfs , and the extreme case is that we take only one particle and one species spf for each species , which reduces to the mean - field treatment .",

    "a single - species system , ml - mctdhb and mctdhb @xcite coincide for one - dimensional bosons without internal degrees of freedom .",
    "when considering a single species of bosons living in a higher - dimensional configuration space , @xmath3 with both spatial and internal dof , ml - mctdhb reduces to mctdhb if all the primitive modes are directly combined to the particle node . for bosonic mixtures",

    "the state vector of the total system is expanded in standard mctdhbs as the summation over the products of the permanents states belonging to each species , while in species multi - layer mctdhb the state vector is firstly expanded with respect to hartree products of species spfs , and the species spfs are then expanded within the permanents basis of each species . hence , ml - mctdhb recovers the standard mctdhbs treatment if as many species spfs are provided as there are configurations for each species .",

    ", one needs @xmath200 coefficients . finally , the species ml - mctdhb ansatz consists of @xmath201 coefficients .",

    "the ml - mctdhb wave function ansatz consists of three orders of magnitude less coefficients than the corresponding mctdh - bb ansatz . for large numbers of species",

    "to illustrate this idea , we focus on the particle ml - mctdhb and assume that the hamiltonian @xmath241 has some symmetry group @xmath242 and let @xmath243 be an element of the unitary representation of @xmath242 in the many - body hilbert space , i.e. @xmath244=0 $ ] .",

    "@xmath243 can be further represented as a product of operators acting on the @xmath10-th logical dof of the @xmath59-th layer : @xmath247 .",
    "let us assume that initially the total wave function and all spfs are invariant under the respective symmetry operators , @xmath4 @xmath248 and @xmath249 .",
    "then the hamiltonian matrix @xmath250 in ( [ eq_parml ] ) does not allow transitions from the permanent state @xmath251 with @xmath252 to @xmath253 with @xmath254 and @xmath255 , when propagating the coefficients for a small time step @xmath256 , i.e. @xmath250 vanishes for such permanent states .",
    "hence , we are left to show that the spfs preserve their symmetry up to @xmath257 when propagating them for a small time step .",
    "we note that the mean - field operator matrices of a hamiltonian containing at most @xmath258-body terms can be expressed by the @xmath258-body reduced density matrices and one - body operators . now the initially well defined many - body symmetry , @xmath259 , implies that the @xmath258-body reduced density matrix elements @xmath260 can only be non - vanishing if @xmath261 up to integer multiples of @xmath262 .",
    "this can be seen implicitly from the mean field matrices ( [ mf_pot_inter ] ) in the example of two - body interactions .",
    "if we further group the initial spfs @xmath263 into classes of the same @xmath264 , the inverses of the one - body reduced density matrices in ( [ dmat_pml ] ) are initially block diagonal . with these two observations",

    "please note that this symmetry conservation property can not be expected _ a priori _ due to the truncation of the many - body hilbert space and the complicated integro - differential equations for the spfs and to the best of our knowledge this has not been shown previously .",
    "possibly this symmetry conservation can be employed for specifying the configuration selection in selected configuration mctdh type methods ( cf .",

    "in this section we briefly comment on some technical details of the ml - mctdhb algorithm , and we mainly focus on two issues : the permanent state sequencing and the second - quantization calculations , which manifest themselves as a major challenge in the numerical treatment of the bosonic systems .    a permanent state of @xmath273 can be naturally viewed as an array of m integers with the constraint @xmath274 .",
    "taking a single species bosonic system for instance , the coefficients of all @xmath275 , @xmath3 , @xmath276 are normally stored in a one - dimensional array , and the index @xmath93 , @xmath4 the position , of @xmath276 in the array is given by an indexing function of @xmath277 . due to the constraint of @xmath274 , we make use of the so - called combinadic numbers @xcite for the indexing .",
    "the combinadic numbers can be characterized as follows : firstly @xmath142 is related to an integer @xmath278 , then all @xmath142 are sorted by the descending order of this integer , and @xmath277 is defined as the sequence number of @xmath142 in the sequence . for example , we have @xmath279=1 $ ] , @xmath280=2 $ ] and @xmath281=\\binom{n+m-1}{m-1}$ ] . in the ml - mctdhb implementation",
    "the more important function is actually the inverse function of @xmath277 , named as @xmath282 .",
    "we build a table @xmath283 of a @xmath284 matrix to represent @xmath282 , of which the element of @xmath285 stores the occupation number in the @xmath30-th orbital of the @xmath88-th permanent state in the descending order . this table only needs to be built once at the beginning of the calculation with an overall negligible cpu time",
    ".    the second - quantization calculations mainly appear in the equations of motion for the species coefficients and also the mean - field operators of the particle layer . here",
    "we demonstrate the strategy applied in ml - mctdhb for such second - quantization calculations with the example of the equations of motion .",
    "the equations of motion for @xmath276 can be summarized as @xmath286 the first term on the rhs of the equation is related to the one - body operator , and the second term is related to the two - body operator .",
    "equation ( [ eq_looping ] ) must be applied to all permanent states . to calculate the rhs of ( [ eq_looping ] ) ,",
    "firstly we need to loop over all the permanent states of @xmath142 , and for each permanent state two more loops over the orbitals @xmath287 and @xmath288 are required for the one - body and two - body operators , which ends up with a loop of the total number @xmath289 . in each loop unit , the function @xmath290 or @xmath291 must be calculated , and this leads to huge numerical costs . the second quantization calculation for the mean - field operators",
    "are done in the same way as the equations of motion .",
    "however , in the ml - mctdhb implementation , we use another strategy which can not only reduce the total amount of loops but meanwhile avoid the calculation of the index function @xmath290 or @xmath291 . to illustrate this ,",
    "we rewrite the equation ( [ eq_looping ] ) as @xmath292 the equation ( [ eq_loop2 ] ) can be interpreted as follows : we generate a one - dimensional array of length @xmath293 , which stores the value of @xmath294 for all the permanent states . to fill in the array , @xmath4 , to calculate the time derivative of all the permanent states , we start with the one - body operators and loop over the permanent states @xmath295 for @xmath296 bosons instead of those for @xmath0 bosons and calculate @xmath297 to put the value in the position of @xmath298 . for the two - body operators , we loop over the permanent states @xmath299 for @xmath300 bosons , calculating @xmath301 and putting it in the position @xmath302 of the array . in this way",
    "the total number of loops reduces from @xmath289 to @xmath303 .",
    "the strategy of equation ( [ eq_loop2 ] ) can also help to avoid calculating the indexing function @xmath277 , as @xmath277 is only an intermediate step linking two permanent states , which can be done by means of two pre - build tables , named @xmath304 and @xmath305 , of @xmath306 and @xmath307 arrays , respectively . in @xmath304 , the element @xmath308 stores the index of the permanent state @xmath309 , where the integer @xmath310 is the combinadic number of @xmath311 . similarly ,",
    "the element @xmath312 stores the index of the permanent state @xmath313 , with @xmath310 being the combinadic number of @xmath311 .",
    "these two tables take almost negligible cpu time in the initialization step of the calculation . with equation ( [ eq_loop2 ] ) ,",
    "the total loops amount is greatly reduced and simultaneously the time - consuming calculations of the index functions is avoided , which leads to a great reduction of the cpu time of the overall calculations .    in this section",
    "we have presented how we face the major challenge of the ml - mctdhb implementation , namely how to deal with the initialization and calculations within the second quantization formalism .",
    "we demonstrate that by introducing three indexing tables @xmath283 , @xmath304 and @xmath305 , we have an efficient solution to the difficulties in the second - quantization treatment , which both reduce the looping times and the calculation cost in each loop unit . moreover , the @xmath304 and @xmath305 are particularly constructed for the one - body and two - body operators , and such a strategy also enables us to conveniently extend to f - particle interactions , simply by generating a table containing the mapping from permanent state @xmath314 to @xmath315 .      having introduced the theory of ml - mctdhb , we now turn to a brief introduction to our code .",
    "our ml - mctdhb code is based on the general ml - mctdh implementation @xcite in its recursive formulation @xcite .",
    "we have developed our code based on the multilayer machinery of the heidelberg mctdh85 package @xcite , and equipped it with the machinery of dealing with bosonic ensembles . since this ml - mctdh implementation is capable of handing arbitrary ml - mctdh wave function expansions , we have extended the scheme to species and particle ml - mctdhb as well as mixtures of both .",
    "hence , in principle an arbitrary number of bosonic species in arbitrary dimensions can be treated .",
    "as introduced in the previous sections , the ml - mctdhb scheme is divided into various separate functional bricks , such as the initialization of the tree structure with the permanent tables @xmath283 , @xmath304 and @xmath305 , the construction of the hamiltonian , the mean - field operators and the density matrices of different layers , and the combination of all these components to the rhs of the equations of motion to perform the integration .",
    "our ml - mctdhb code is then designed in a systematic structure , consisting of various modules , which accommodate the requirements of different functional bricks of the method .",
    "the code can now carry out propagations in the real and imaginary time , which correspond to the calculation of the dynamics and the relaxation to the ground state , respectively . moreover , improved relaxation @xcite is also implemented in our code , in which the non - top node coefficients are still propagated in imaginary time while the top - node coefficients are obtained by direct diagonalization . in the improved relaxation ,",
    "the imaginary time propagation of non - top node coefficients and the diagonalization of top node coefficients are done recursively .",
    "when convergence is reached , both the top - node and non - top node coefficients become constant in the diagonalization and imaginary time propagation , respectively , which corresponds to a stationary state of the system , @xmath4 an eigenstate . by carefully choosing the initial state of the improved relaxation ,",
    "we can obtain different eigenstates of the system , which lie in the truncated hilbert space given by the ml - mctdhb ansatz .    at the moment , our ml - mctdhb scheme can deal with arbitrary two - body interactions - an extension to three- or four - body interactions would be straightforward .",
    "we adopt the product form of the interactions , as introduced in section [ subsec_species ] , and this allows a recursive construction of the hamiltonian expressed and also the mean - field operators on different layers .",
    "ultra - cold bosonic atoms constitute an important class of systems , which can be attacked by the ml - mctdhb theory . in this particular context",
    ", the contact interaction turns out to be very relevant . approximating the delta interaction potential by a narrow gaussian",
    ", the potfit machinery can be applied for obtaining the desired product form ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . for one - dimensional settings , we have also developed an exact implementation of the contact interaction @xmath316 _ without _ reshaping it into the product form in order to liberate the simulations from the artificial length scale induced by the gaussian approximation of the delta function .",
    "moreover , the direct implementation of the contact potential has speeded up the simulation by one order of magnitude in comparison to a product representation of the same accuracy .",
    "the main difference in the derivation of the equations of motion lies in the fact that one can not separate the mean - field operators into a scalar matrix and a operator valued factor anymore , which breaks the recursive multi - layer formulation ( cf .",
    "the appendix ) . for the explicit equations of motion with the efficient treatment of the contact interaction we refer the reader to @xcite .    depending on the concrete problem",
    ", we employ an appropriate discrete variable representation ( dvr ) of the spfs @xcite , such as the ( radial ) harmonic oscillator dvr , the sine dvr , the exponential dvr and the legendre dvr , which have been implemented in our code .",
    "so in the case of the exact implementation of the delta interaction , the grid point spacing defines the smallest length scale , thus an ultraviolet cutoff .    for integrating the equations of motion ,",
    "we employ either zvode , a variable - coefficient ordinary differential equation solver with fixed - leading - coefficient implementation @xcite , or dopri , an explicit runge - kutta method of order five with step size control and dense output @xcite .",
    "we can also use the ml - mctdhb scheme to calculate the expectation values of the combination of one - body and two - body operators .",
    "for instance , we can calculate the total energy or separately the kinetic energy and potential energy evolution , the one - body density and the two - body density matrices .",
    "especially , the two - body density matrices are already calculated during the propagation as a building brick for the mean - field operators , so that such quantities can be obtained for free in terms of computational time ( cf .",
    "also @xcite ) .",
    "in the following , we focus on the tunneling dynamics of ultra - cold bosonic atoms in a one - dimensional double well trap made of a harmonic trap superimposed with a gaussian at the trap centre , i.e. @xmath317 in harmonic oscillator units @xmath318 .",
    "firstly , we will compare the single species tunneling results of our ml - mctdhb implementation with the results of the implementations of mctdh @xcite .",

    "applications of particle ml - mctdhb will be presented somewhere else .    in both examples ,",
    "we prepare the initial state by modifying the trapping potential such that it becomes energetically favorable for the bosons to be in the left well .",
    "the bosonic ensemble is then relaxed to the many - body ground state by propagating the equations of motion in imaginary time .",
    "the resulting many - body state is finally propagated in real time in the original double well trap .      as a first application",
    ", we simulate the tunneling dynamics of a single - species bosonic ensemble in the double well .",

    "the simulations based on the single - band approximation predict that the tunneling is suppressed for interaction strengths above some critical value , while the extended model predicts the weakening of such a suppression in the strong interaction regime , where higher bands effects can not be neglected . in this way",
    "the double well potential manifests itself as a proper test bed for the higher band effects . in this section",
    "we will simulate the double well tunneling with ml - mctdhb , and perform a detailed analysis to resolve the higher bands effects .        here",
    "we present the tunneling dynamics of four and ten bosons in a double well potential .",
    "a sin - dvr is employed , which intrinsically introduces hard - wall boundaries at both ends of the potential ( cf .",
    "appendix of @xcite ) .",
    "firstly we show the simulation of the four - boson tunneling , in comparison with the mctdh simulation using the heidelberg mctdh package @xcite . to have a direct comparison between ml - mctdhb and mctdh results , we adopt in both simulations a narrow gaussian interaction to model the contact interaction , and the interaction is written as @xmath320 , with @xmath321 .",
    "next we extend the simulation to the ten - boson case , and the contact interaction is modeled by the exact delta function .",
    "the simulation of the tunneling of ten bosons becomes impractical with mctdh , and we only perform the simulation with ml - mctdhb .",
    "figure [ tunneling-4b ] summarizes the population evolution of 4 bosons in the double well for different interaction strengths .",
    "when the interaction strength is zero , the system undergoes rabi oscillations , as shown in figure [ tunneling-4b](a ) . as the interaction strength increases to 0.5",
    ", the oscillations almost vanish on a relative long time scale , which indicates the delayed tunneling behaviour .",
    "when the interaction strength increases to 2.0 , as shown in figure [ tunneling-4b](c ) , the amplitude of the population oscillations is increased from less than 0.06 in delayed tunneling ( figure [ tunneling-4b](b ) ) to around 1.0 , which is referred to as enhanced tunneling . as the interaction increases even further to 4.0 , the quasistationary state is approached during tunneling , where the populations of the left and the right well approach the value of two with only small fluctuations , as shown in figure [ tunneling-4b](d ) .",
    "summarizing , figure [ tunneling-4b ] illustrates the tunneling transition from rabi oscillations through delayed tunneling and enhanced tunneling to the quasistationary state as the interaction strength increases from zero to the strong interaction regime .",
    "the ml - mctdhb results show a very good agreement with the mctdh calculations . only for the interaction strength @xmath322",
    ", deviations occur , which can be explained by the different implementations of the potfit algorithm in mctdh and ml - mctdhb .",
    "nevertheless , we still observe qualitatively the same behaviour of the emergence of the quasistationary state in both simulations .",
    "moreover , more orbitals are needed to achieve good convergence in the strong interaction case of @xmath322 , and we supply ten orbitals to this case , where good convergence can be deduced from the natural populations discussed in the following .",
    "the natural populations can confirm the convergence of the calculation and also manifest themselves as a measure of the fragmentation of the system @xcite , which is defined as the depletion of the population of the highest occupied natural orbital from unity . to uncover the fundamental effect giving rise to the enhanced tunneling and quasistationary state",
    ", we plot the natural populations and one - body density profiles of the four - boson ensemble at different time instants during the tunneling process in figures [ density-4b ] .",
    "figure [ density-4b](a ) and ( c ) show the natural populations and one - body densities for @xmath323 . in figure [ density-4b](a ) , firstly we see the lowest natural population saturates to a value less than @xmath324 , which confirms the convergence of the simulation . in figure [ density-4b](c ) , we observe that the profile in the left well remains as a gaussian packet , while the profile in the right well presents a two - hump structure . the two - hump profile is a signature of the occupation of the first excited state in the right well , and this indicates that the enhanced tunneling is due to the higher band occupation , @xmath4 the interband tunneling . in the 2-boson ensemble @xcite",
    "the enhanced tunneling only takes place in the fermionization regime , @xmath4 for the interaction strength approaching infinity , while as the number of bosons increases , it becomes easier to excite higher bands , and the enhanced tunneling arises even in an interaction regime far below the fermionization limit .",
    "the natural populations for @xmath322 , as shown in figure [ density-4b](b ) show a good convergence of the simulation with the lowest natural population saturating well below 1 percent , and at @xmath322 more natural orbitals contribute to the tunneling process , which suggests that fragmentation of the system and the presence of multiple tunneling channels in the dynamics .",
    "figure [ density-4b](d ) shows the one - body densities at different times for the interaction strength @xmath322 , where the quasistationary state dominates the tunneling . during the tunneling ,",
    "the one - body density profile presents multiple oscillations in both the left and right wells , which indicates multiple higher - band excitations in the tunneling process . in the exact quantum dynamics study of the double well system @xcite ,",
    "the quasistationary state is explained by the quick loss of coherence of the system , and the multiple excitation of higher energetic levels in the left and right well suggests that the tunneling process involves a large number of higher band number states , and in consequence multiple tunneling channels .",
    "the dephasing between these tunneling channels can be a source of the loss of coherence of the bosons in the two wells .",
    "figure [ tunneling-10b ] shows the tunneling evolution of a system of ten bosons in the double well with varying interaction strength .",
    "we focus on the enhanced tunneling and quasistationary state for a sufficiently large interaction strength .",
    "enhanced tunneling is observed with an interaction strength as weak as @xmath325 , as shown in figure [ tunneling-10b ] , and at @xmath326 the system slowly evolves to the quasistationary state .",
    "figures [ density-10b](a ) to ( d ) show the natural populations and one - body densities at different time instants during the tunneling process of figures [ tunneling-10b](a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "the fact that the lowest natural population saturates to relatively small values of the order of 0.1% and 1% in figures [ density-10b ] ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively , illustrates the well - controlled behavior of the convergence of the simulation . in figure [ density-10b](c ) , the two - hump profile in the right well indicates that the enhanced tunneling is again a result of interband tunneling , and the multi - mode oscillatory structure in figure [ density-10b](d ) suggests that multiple tunneling channels are involved and this can lead to the decoherence between the two wells , and consequently to the appearance of the quasistationary state .",
    "to summarize , in this section we presented the tunneling dynamics of single species bosons in a one - dimensional double well potential .",
    "we supply the cross check with results obtained by the heidelberg mctdh , which indicates the stable performance of ml - mctdhb , and also the check of convergence by the natural populations .",
    "further , we also demonstrate the ability of the method for various and extended investigations , via different analysis routines , such as the population evolution and the one - body density evolution for larger systems .",
    "let us now consider the tunneling dynamics of two bosonic species , called the a and b species which are loaded in the left well of the double well trap .",
    "all species shall have the same mass , which is set to one , and shall experience the same double well potential @xmath327 .",
    "the intra - species interaction strengths @xmath328 of the contact interaction potentials @xmath329 @xmath330 , however , are assumed to be different for different species @xmath331 .",
    "furthermore , the inter - species interaction is also modelled by a pseudo - potential : @xmath332 .",
    "all delta potentials are implemented numerically exactly as explained in @xcite .",
    "the choice @xmath333 and @xmath334 provides us with three bands below the barrier energy with two single particle eigenstates each .",
    "the energetic separation of the lowest band to the first one amounts to 1.63 , while the level spacing of the lowest band equals 0.23 resulting in a rabi - tunneling period of 27 . for preparing the initial state of the mixture , we modify the double well trap by letting @xmath335 for @xmath336 .",
    "we consider a binary mixture made of 2 a and 2 b bosons . with @xmath337 , @xmath338 and @xmath339 . due to the not too different intra - species interaction strengths , we provide for each species the same number of species spfs , @xmath340 , and particle spfs , @xmath341 . in the following ,",
    "we compare simulations done with ml - mctdhb and ml - mctdh @xcite .",
    "although the initial state for the relaxation run is - from a mathematical perspective - perfectly symmetric with respect to particle exchange within each species , one has to pay attention to the initially unoccupied species spfs in ml - mctdh .",
    "these have to be symmetrized by hand because otherwise the ml - mctdh propagation will not preserve the exchange symmetry within each species .",
    "mctdh and its derivative methods are proven to preserve both the norm and the total energy exactly ( cf .",
    "appendix of @xcite ) . using the zvode integrator with an absolute and relative tolerance of @xmath342 and integrating @xmath343 harmonic oscillator time units",
    ", the norm of the total wave function deviates from unity by @xmath344 and the total energy is conserved up to @xmath345 for both ml - mctdh and ml - mctdhb .    before discussing the convergence of the simulations with respect to the number of particle and species spfs ,",
    "we first summarize the results for the different one- and two - body observables .",
    "figure [ fig_2x2_tunnel_prob ] shows the time evolution of the probability for finding an a ( b ) boson in the left well .",
    "one clearly sees that the tunneling period of the a bosons is enlarged in comparison to the rabi - tunneling period .",
    "in contrast to this , the probability evolution of finding a b boson in the left well qualitatively resembles a first rabi - cycle but afterwards also features a delay .",
    "this observation is quite plausible : since both the @xmath346 and @xmath347 are smaller than @xmath348 , one expects that the b bosons require a longer interaction time in order to show an interaction - induced effect .",
    "the impact of the different interaction strengths can also be seen in figure [ fig_2x2_tunnel_jointprob ] : while the probability for finding two a bosons in the same well is well above 0.5 for most of the propagation time , showing a binding tendency , the b bosons tend to stay in the same well less likely . on the contrary , the probability for finding an a and a b boson in the same well fluctuates around 0.5 indicating that the bosons of each species tunnel independently .    ,",
    "@xmath338 and @xmath339 . @xmath207 and @xmath349 spfs for both calculations .",
    "the dashed vertical lines : the first three rabi - tunneling periods of a single particle.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    : the blue ( red ) solid line : probability of finding both a ( b ) bosons in the same well ; the green solid line : the probability of detecting an a and an b boson in the same well .",
    "solid lines : ml - mctdhb .",
    "crosses : ml - mctdh . dashed vertical lines : the first three rabi - tunneling periods.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    for judging the convergence of the simulations , we present the natural populations for different subsystems . figure [ fig_2x2_natpop_spec ] shows the natural populations corresponding to the reduced density matrix of the whole species a ( or b ) .",
    "one clearly sees that after about 25 time units three species states contribute to the total wave function with weights of the order of 89% , 10% and 1% .",
    "the fourth state contributes so little that it could be neglected without affecting the results .    .",
    "the solid lines refer to the ml - mctdhb and the crosses to the corresponding ml - mctdh calculation.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the natural populations of the reduced density matrix corresponding to an a and a b boson , respectively , are plotted in figure [ fig_2x2_natpop_part ] . here",
    "again , we notice that the lowest natural population stays well below 1% , meaning that its natural orbital , the corresponding eigenstate of the respective reduced one - body density matrix , has only marginal influence on the result .",
    "furthermore , we observe that two natural orbitals contribute with almost equal weight during certain time intervals .",
    "hence , a mean - field approximation would be improper , which was to be expected for such a few - body system . in terms of the numerical correctness of our implementation",
    ", we note that the ml - mctdhb results excellently agree with the simulations performed with ml - mctdh .    in this section",
    "we have demonstrated the correctness of the implementation of ml - mctdhb in comparison with mctdh and ml - mctdh , with an excellent agreement being observed .",
    "it is worth pointing out that ml - mctdhb is not only more efficient , but allows us to treat more complicated systems with more particles , more species and for stronger correlations . for an application of ml - mctdhb to a more involved tunneling scenario of a bosonic mixture ,",
    "we refer the reader to ref @xcite .",
    "the ab - initio methods mctdhb and ml - mctdh for the investigation of many - particle quantum systems possess different emphases and foci : while mctdhb aims at employing the bosonic particle exchange symmetry for obtaining a better performance , ml - mctdh focuses on how to obtain a more compact ansatz for the many - body wave function by employing physical knowledge about correlations within and between _ subsystems_. in general however , the high flexibility of the ml - mctdh wave function ansatz is incompatible with the generic correlations due to the bosonic exchange symmetry in a mctdhb wave function expansion .    in this work",
    ", we have shown that one can benefit from the advantages of both the mctdhb and the ml - mctdh concept if one restricts oneself to two - quite natural - classes of wave function expansion schemes ( and any combination thereof ) :",
    "( i ) in species ml - mctdhb , the total wave function of a bosonic multi - component system firstly is expanded in hartree products made of states with each of them corresponding to a state of a whole species . then each of these species states is expanded in permanents like in mctdhb .",
    "( ii ) in particle ml - mctdhb , a single component bosonic system is considered with the bosons living in two or three dimensions and/or having internal degrees of freedom . there , the total wave function is expanded in terms of permanents and a ml - mctdh expansion is applied to all the orbitals underlying those permanents .",
    "summarizing , the bosonic exchange symmetry is exactly and efficiently taken into account in ml - mctdhb as any state of indistinguishable bosons is expanded in permanents .",
    "the multi - layer concept is then employed for obtaining an optimized wave function ansatz guided by the correlations between different species ( intra- versus inter - species correlations ) or between different spatial directions ( e.g. in quasi two- or quasi three - dimensional systems ) or internal degrees of freedom . by comparing with other methods of the mctdh family",
    ", we have demonstrated the beneficial scaling of ml - mctdhb .",
    "like in all mctdh type methods , the convergence of a simulation with respect to the number of provided states in the wave function ansatz can be judged by the eigenvalue distributions of the reduced density matrices corresponding to different subsystems .",
    "we have implemented ml - mctdhb on the basis of the ml - mctdh scheme @xcite in such a general way that , in principle , we can deal with an arbitrary number of species in arbitrary dimensions with different types of interactions , such as the contact as well as the dipolar interactions - only limited by the number of states needed for a converged simulation , which depends on the system details , of course .",
    "furthermore , the scheme can in principle also deal with hybrid systems such as a single ion coupled to an environment of indistinguishable bosons like liquid @xmath350 as long as all the interactions can be efficiently brought into the potfit product form .",
    "finally , we note that both conceptually and practically it is relatively straightforward to generalize the presented method to fermionic systems , i.e. to ml - mctdhf , or to mixed bosonic - fermionic systems , i.e. to ml - mctdhbf : similar to equation ( [ spc_spf ] ) , one could start with an appropriate ml - mctdh expansion in which all indistinguishable particles of one kind are grouped into a species node , and expand the species spfs with respect to the permanent states and slater determinants for bosonic and fermionic species , respectively .",
    "this approach is in particular compatible with our ml - mctdhb method and its implementation , and would lead to a highly efficient algorithm for simulating the most general composite systems consisting of subsystems with indistinguishable constituents .",
    "the authors would like to thank hans - dieter meyer and jan stockhofe for fruitful discussions on mctdh methods and symmetry conservation .",

    "<S> we develop the multi - layer multi - configuration time - dependent hartree method for bosons ( ml - mctdhb ) , a variational numerically exact ab - initio method for studying the quantum dynamics and stationary properties of general bosonic systems . </S>",
    "<S> ml - mctdhb takes advantage of the permutation symmetry of identical bosons , which allows for investigations of the quantum dynamics from few to many - body systems </S>",
    "<S> . moreover , the multi - layer feature enables ml - mctdhb to describe mixed bosonic systems consisting of arbitrary many species . </S>",
    "<S> multi - dimensional as well as mixed - dimensional systems can be accurately and efficiently simulated via the multi - layer expansion scheme . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a detailed account of the underlying theory and the corresponding implementation . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate the superior performance by applying the method to the tunneling dynamics of bosonic ensembles in a one - dimensional double well potential , where a single - species bosonic ensemble of various correlation strengths and a weakly interacting two - species bosonic ensemble are considered . </S>"
