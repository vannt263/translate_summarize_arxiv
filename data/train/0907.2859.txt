    "they are all random variables at time @xmath0 .",
    "we can conduct this hypothesis testing in several ways based on different criterions and different assumptions",
    "@xcite-@xcite :    1 .",
    "energy detection @xcite-@xcite : energy detection is widely considered due to its simple complexity and no need of _ a priori _ knowledge of ps .",
    "however , due to noise and interference power uncertainty , the performance of energy detection severely degrades @xcite@xcite , and the detector fails to differentiate ps from the interference .",
    "cyclostationary detection @xcite-@xcite : stationary ps signal can be exploited to achieve a better and more robust detector .",
    "stationary observation coupled with the periodicity of carriers , pulse trains , repeating spreading code , etc .",
    ", results in a cyclostationary model for the signal , which can be exploited in frequency domain by the spectral correlation function @xcite@xcite , with high computational complexity and long observation duration .",
    "3 .   locking detection @xcite@xcite : in practical communication systems , pilots and preambles are usually periodically transmitted to facilitate synchronization and channel estimation , etc .",
    "these known signals can be used for locking detection to distinguish ps from noise and the interference . however",
    ", locking detection requires more _ a priori _ information about ps , including frame structure , modulation types , and coding schemes , etc .",
    "covariance - based detection @xcite-@xcite : because of the dispersive channels , the utility of multiple antennas , or even over - sampling , the signals from ps are correlated and can be utilized to differentiate ps from white noise .",
    "the existence of ps can be determined by evaluating the structure of covariance matrix of the received signals .",
    "the detector can be implemented blindly @xcite by singular value decomposition , that is , it requires no _ a priori _ knowledge of ps and noise , but needs good computational complexity .",
    "wavelet - based detection @xcite : the detection is implemented by modeling the entire wideband signals as consecutive frequency subbands where the power spectral characteristic is smooth within each subband but exhibits an abrupt change between neighboring subbands , at the price of high sampling rate due to wideband signals .    however , above spectrum sensing mechanisms , focusing on physical layer detection or estimation at cr - tx , ignore the spectrum availability at cr receiver .",
    "we could illustrate the insufficiency of traditional spectrum sensing model , especially to network crs .",
    "due to existence of fading channels and noise uncertainty along with limited sensing duration @xcite , even when there is no detectable transmission of ps during this venerable period , the receiver of this opportunistic transmission ( i.e. cr - rx ) may still suffer from collisions from simultaneous transmission(s ) , as fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] shows .",
    "the cr - rx locates in the middle of cr - tx and ps - tx and ps activities are hidden to cr - tx , which induces a challenge to spectrum sensing .",
    "we can either develop more powerful sensing techniques such as cooperative sensing @xcite-@xcite to alleviate hidden terminal problem , or a more realistic mathematical model for spectrum sensing what we are going to do hereafter .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "we elaborate a realistic definition of link availability and system model in section ii and present general spectrum sensing with / without cooperation in section iii an iv respectively . in section",
    "v , realistic operation of crn is suggested to investigate impacts of spectrum sensing and cooperative scheme on network operation .",
    "numerical results and examples are illustrated in section vi .",
    "finally , conclusions are made in section vii .",
    "from a viewpoint of information theory , spectrum sensing can be modeled as a binary channel that transmit cr link availability ( one bit information in link layer ) to cr - tx with transition probabilities representing spectrum sensing capability , probability of missing detection and probability of false alarm .",
    "therefore , traditional spectrum sensing mechanisms could be explained by a mathematical structure of defining link availability .    cr link availability , between cr - tx and cr - rx , is specified by an indicator function @xmath6    [ d1 ] cr - tx senses the spectrum and determines link availability based on its observation as @xmath7    [ l5 ] traditional spectrum sensing for cr link suggests @xmath8 .",
    "the definition of link availability is pretty much similar to the clear channel assessment ( cca ) of medium access control ( mac ) in the ieee 802.11 wireless local area networks ( wlan ) , or the medium availability indicator in @xcite .",
    "we may have a correspondence between link availability in dynamic channel access of cognitive radio networks ( crn ) , and the cca in mac of wlan .    as we explain in figure [ fig_1 ] and/or take interference into testing scenario",
    ", we may note that * lemma [ l5 ] * is not generally true . to generally model spectrum",
    "sensing , including hidden terminal scenarios , we have to reach two simultaneous conditions : ( 1 ) cr - tx senses the link available to transmit ( 2 ) cr - rx can successfully receive packets , which means no ps signal at cr - rx side , nor significant interference to prohibit successful cr packet reception ( i.e. beyond a target sinr )",
    ". in other words , at cr - rx , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the sinr threshold at cr - rx for outage in reception over fading channels , @xmath11 is the received power from opportunistic transmission from cr - tx , @xmath12 is the power contributed from ps simultaneous operation for general network topology such as ad hoc , @xmath13 is the total interference power from other co - existing radio systems @xcite , and @xmath14 is band - limited noise power , with assuming independence among ps , cr , interference systems , and noise .    based on this observation , cr link availability should be composed of localized spectrum availability at cr - tx and cr - rx , which may not be identical in general .",
    "the inconsistency of spectrum availability at cr - tx and cr - rx is rarely noted in current literatures .",
    "however , this factor not only suggests spatial behavior for cr - tx and cr - rx but also is critical to some networking performance such as throughput of crn , etc .",
    "@xcite developed a brilliant two - switch model to capture distributed and dynamic spectrum availability .",
    "however , @xcite focused on capacity from information theory and it is hard to directly extend the model in studying network operation of crn .",
    "actually , two switching functions can be generalized as indicator functions to indicate the activities of ps based on the sensing by cr - tx and cr - rx respectively @xcite .",
    "generalizing the concept of @xcite@xcite to facilitate our study in spectrum sensing and further impacts on network operation , we represent the spectrum availability at cr - rx by an another indicator function .",
    "the true availability for cr - rx can be indicated by @xmath15    please note that the activity of ps estimated at cr - rx in @xcite may not be identical to @xmath16 .",
    "that is , even when cr - rx senses that ps is active , cr - rx may still successfully receive packets from cr - tx if the received power from cr - tx is strong enough to satisfy ( [ e28 ] ) .",
    "we call this rate - distance nature @xcite that is extended from an overlay concept @xcite . therefore , we consider a more realistic mathematical model for cr link availability that can be represented as multiplication ( i.e. and operation ) of the indicator functions of spectrum availability at cr - tx and cr - rx to satisfy two simultaneous conditions for cr link availability .    [ p1 ] @xmath17    to obtain the spectrum availability at cr - rx ( i.e. @xmath18 ) and to eliminate hidden terminal problem , a handshake mechanism has been proposed by sending request to send ( rts ) and clear to send ( cts ) frames .",
    "however , the effectiveness of rts / cts degrades in general ad hoc networks @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since crs have lower priority in the co - existing primary / secondary communication model , crs should cherish the venerable duration for transmission and reduce the overhead caused by information exchange and increases spectrum utilization accordingly .",
    "therefore , the next challenge would be that @xmath18 can not be known _ a priori _ at cr - tx , due to no centralized coordination nor information exchange in advance among crs when cr - tx wants to transmit . as a result , general spectrum sensing turns out to be a composite hypothesis testing . in this paper",
    ", we introduce statistical inference that is seldom applied in traditional spectrum sensing to predict / estimate spectrum availability at cr - rx and to regard it as performance lower bound in general spectrum sensing .    further examining * proposition  [ p1 ] *",
    ", we see that prediction of @xmath18 is necessary when @xmath19 , which is equivalent to prediction of @xmath20 . in this paper",
    ", we model @xmath18 when @xmath19 as a bernoulli process with the probability of spectrum availability at cr - rx @xmath21 .",
    "the value of @xmath22 exhibits spatial behavior of cr - tx and cr - rx and thus impacts of hidden terminal problem .",
    "if @xmath22 is large , cr - rx is expected to be close to cr - tx and hidden terminal problem rarely occurs ( and vise versa ) .",
    "the prediction of @xmath18 at cr - tx can be modeled as a hypothesis testing , that is , detecting @xmath18 with _ a priori _",
    "probability @xmath22 but no observation . to design optimum detection ,",
    "we consider minimum bayesian risk criterion , where bayesian risk is defined by @xmath23 in ( [ e30 ] ) , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 denotes the normalized weighting factor to evaluate costs of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 represents prediction of @xmath20 .",
    "we will show that the value of @xmath30 relates to the outage probability of cr link in section v.    since @xmath18 is unavailable at cr - tx , we have to develop techniques to `` obtain '' some information of spectrum availability at cr - rx . inspired by the crn tomography @xcite@xcite , we may want to derive the statistical inference of @xmath18 based on earlier observation .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that cr - tx can learn the status of @xmath18 at previous times when @xmath19 , which is indexed by @xmath31 .",
    "that is , at time @xmath31 , cr - tx can learn the value of @xmath32,\\mathbf{1}^{rx}[n-2],\\ldots$ ] .",

    "inference - based spectrum sensing at cr - tx thus becomes @xmath40 where @xmath41 is in ( [ e1 ] ) .",

    "otherwise , cr - tx is prohibited from using the link even when cr - tx feels free for transmission because it can generate unaffordable cost , that is , intolerable interference to ps or collisions at cr - rx .",

    "that is , for one cr link with @xmath348 ( e.g. cr - rx is close to cr - tx or spectrum utilization of ps is low ) , large @xmath176 is preferred to achieve low risk .",
    "however , from network perspective , to achieve high number of cr links that are admissive to cr - tx ( i.e. to achieve large neighborhood and low @xmath281 ) and thus high throughput of crn , small @xmath176 is preferred .      for multiple cooperative nodes , with six nodes in our simulation ,",
    "we show the performance of cooperative spectrum sensing with limited statistical information @xmath234 due to limited sensing duration .",
    "we first find least - favorable joint pmf @xmath349 by ( [ e35 ] ) and then compute corresponding bayesian risk , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_7 ] under different order of known marginal pmf @xmath138 ( i.e. capability of observation ) .",
    "that is , cr - tx only acquires pmf of @xmath138 out of six cooperative nodes .",
    "the risk is compared to that with the optimum sensing rule ( [ e14 ] ) and that with assumption of independent spectrum availability ( [ e34 ] ) .",
    "obviously , bayesian risk decreases and approaches to that in the optimum case as the order of known marginal pmf @xmath138 increases because more information is acquired to generate @xmath349 closer to the true one @xmath350 .",
    "we observe that when the order @xmath138 is greater than 3 , robust spectrum sensing outperforms the case of traditional independence assumption",
    ". therefore , if cr - tx would like to select six cooperative nodes , cr - tx only requires statistical information about spectrum availability among three out of six cooperative nodes , i.e. @xmath351 , to achieve better performance than the case according to reliability criterion .        in fig .",
    "[ fig_4 ] , we illustrate neighborhood of cr - tx ( `` @xmath352 '' in the figure ) without blocking .",
    "the neighborhood boundary with / without a cooperative node ( `` @xmath353 '' in the figure ) is depicted by a thick and a thin line respectively .",
    "the parameters are set as follows : @xmath354 , @xmath355 , @xmath356 , @xmath357 , @xmath358 , @xmath359 , @xmath360 , and @xmath361 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_4](a ) , ps ( `` @xmath362 '' in the figure ) is placed near to cr - tx ( @xmath363 ) .",
    "we observe that cr - tx almost perfectly detects the state of ps , i.e. , @xmath316 and @xmath317 , and @xmath364 by ( [ e38 ] ) .",
    "therefore , neighborhood of cr - tx approaches to its coverage and the cooperative node is not necessary in this case from a viewpoint of network operation .",
    "however , when ps is apart from cr - tx ( @xmath365 ) as we shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] , the neighborhood at ps side shrinks and is no longer circularly shaped because ps is hidden to cr - tx and hence probability of collision at cr - rx increases when @xmath255 .",
    "[ fig_4](b)@xmath366(d ) illustrate the neighborhood under different locations of the cooperative node .",
    "we observe that neighborhood area decreases when the cooperative node moves away from ps and there even exists a region where cooperative sensing can not help .",
    "therefore , the cooperative node in fig .",
    "[ fig_4](b ) is the best among these three nodes according to maximum neighborhood area criterion in * proposition [ p5]*.    we present an example of existence of unidirectional link in crn . in fig .",
    "[ fig_4](b ) , assume one cr is located at @xmath367 .",
    "obviously , the cr - tx is not connective to the cr and therefore is prohibited from forwarding packets to the cr .",
    "however , by fig .",
    "[ fig_4](a ) , the cr is connective to cr - tx , which makes the link unidirectional ( only from the cr to cr - tx ) . as * proposition [ p6 ] * , this also shows asymmetric connective relation even under rather ideal radio propagation . with the aid of a cooperative node located at @xmath368 , the link returns to a bidirectional link .",
    "alternatively , we consider effects of shadowing due to blocking , as we illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] .",
    "we set shadowing parameters @xmath369 and parameter of obstacle size @xmath370 and @xmath371 in fig .",
    "[ fig_5](a)(b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig_5](c)(d ) respectively .",
    "we observe that small obstacles size ( i.e. small @xmath270 ) can result in more substantial shrink of the neighborhood , compared to large obstacles size ( i.e. large @xmath270 ) .",
    "the reason is : if @xmath270 is small , only a small region around cr - tx falls in deep shadowing and the state of ps can be successfully detected outside that region .",
    "therefore , this leads to high probability of collision at cr - rx as @xmath255 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath270 is large , crs are likely separated from ps by obstacles , which results in large `` distance '' between cr and ps . here , `` distance '' is measured by received signal power @xcite@xcite . in comparison of the capability of a cooperative node , the one in small @xmath270 has good capability to recover the neighborhood to its coverage even when the node is at opposite side of ps .",
    "however , for large @xmath270 , the cooperative node may also be in deep shadowing and becomes useless to recover neighborhood of cr - tx .",
    "in this paper , we showed that cr link availability should be determined by spectrum availability at both cr - tx and cr - rx , which may not be identical due to hidden terminal problem ( fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] and [ fig_2 ] ) . in order to fundamentally explore the spectrum sensing at link level and its impacts on network operation , we established an indicator model of cr link availability and applied statistical inference to predict / estimate unknown spectrum availability at cr - tx due to no centralized coordinator nor information exchange between cr - tx and cr - rx in advance .",
    "we therefore expressed conditions for cr - tx to forward packets to cr - rx under guaranteed outage probability . these conditions , along with physical channel models ,",
    "define neighborhood of cr - tx , which is no longer circularly shaped as coverage .",
    "this results in asymmetric or even unidirectional links in crn , as we illustrated in section vi .",
    "the impairment of cr links can be alleviated via cooperative scheme .",
    "therefore , spectrum sensing capability determines network topology and thus throughput of crn .",
    "several factors with impacts on spectrum sensing are analyzed , including :    1 .",
    "correlation of spectrum availability at cooperative nodes 2 .",
    "capability of observation at cr - tx ( i.e. available statistical information at cr - rx ) 3",
    ".   locations of cooperative nodes and environment ( i.e. obstacles )    furthermore , limits of cooperative scheme were also addressed in link level and network level .",
    "in addition , to measure sensing capability and then to select cooperative nodes is an important issue because we would like to minimize information exchange to increase spectrum utilization .",
    "criterions from link level ( maximum reliability or minimum bayesian risk ) and network level ( maximum neighborhood area ) perspectives were accordingly proposed .",
    "we numerically demonstrated existence of trade - off in designing systems in different layers .",
    "in addition , robust spectrum sensing was proposed to deal with local and partial information due to no centralized coordination and limited sensing duration in crn .",
