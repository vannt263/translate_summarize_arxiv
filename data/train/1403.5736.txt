    "recently , the raman scattering in the half - metallic cos@xmath0 was studied @xcite in the wide temperature region . the @xmath1 @xmath2 raman line , observed previously at room temperature in ref .",
    "@xcite , demonstrates a particular behavior nearby the ferromagnetic transition at @xmath3 k. the unusual large raman linewidth and shift of the order of 10 @xmath2 were observed .",
    "the reflectivity singularities of cos@xmath0 were explained in ref .",
    "@xcite by the temperature variation of the electronic structure .",
    "another example of the electron - phonon interactions is given in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to explain the phonon singularity at the @xmath4 point in graphene .",
    "the electron - phonon interactions should be considered as well in the interpretation of the observed raman scattering around the curie temperature .",
    "thermal broadening of phonon lines in the raman scattering is usually described in terms of three - phonon anharmonicity , i.e. by the decay of an optical phonon with a frequency @xmath5 in two phonons .",
    "the simplest case when the final state has two acoustic phonon from one branch ( the klemens channel ) was theoretically studied by klemens @xcite , who obtained the temperature dependence of the raman linewidth .",
    "the corresponding lineshift was considered in refs .",
    "this theory was compared in works @xcite with experimental data for si , ge , c , @xmath6sn .",
    "a model was also considered with the phonons in the final state from different branches .",
    "it was found that anharmonic interactions of the forth order should be disregarded at high temperatures @xmath7 k.    the situation is more complicated in substances with magnetic ordering .",
    "the interaction of phonons with magnons in antiferromagnets was discussed in the review article @xcite and more recently in the analysis of the thermal conductivity @xcite , the spin seebeck effect @xcite , high - temperature superconductivity @xcite , and optical spectra @xcite .",
    "the magnon - phonon interaction results in the magnon damping @xcite , however , no effect for phonons was observed .",
    "the influence of antiferromagnetic ordering is considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the line shift was only calculated .",
    "damping of the optical phonons was found @xcite to become large in the rare - earth gd and tb below the curie temperature achieving a value of 15 @xmath2 , which is much greater than the three - phonon interaction effect .    despite attracting considerable interest for half a century since the pioneering work by frhlich , the problem of electron - phonon interaction is still far from being solved .",
    "migdal @xcite developed a consistent many - body approach based on the frhlich hamiltonian for interaction of electrons with acoustic ( sound ) phonons .",
    "as migdal showed ( `` the migdal theorem '' ) , the vertex corrections for acoustic phonons are small by the adiabatic parameter @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the electron and ion masses , respectively . the theory described correctly the electronic lifetime , renormalization of the fermi velocity @xmath11 and acoustic phonon attenuation but resulted in a strong renormalization of the sound velocity @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the dimensionless coupling constant . for sufficiently strong electron - phonon coupling @xmath14 ,",
    "the phonon frequency approached to zero marking an instability point of the system .",
    "instead , one would intuitively expect the phonon renormalization to be weak along with the adiabatic parameter .",
    "this discrepancy was resolved by brovman and kagan @xcite almost a decade later ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "they demonstrated the shortcomings of the frhlich model that gave an anomalously large phonon renormalization . employing",
    "the born  oppenheimer ( adiabatic ) approximation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , they found that there are two terms in the second order perturbation theory , which compensate each other making a result small by the adiabatic parameter .",
    "namely , when calculating the phonon self - energy function @xmath15 with help of the diagram technique , one should eliminate an adiabatic contribution of the frhlich model by subtracting @xmath16 .",
    "the interaction of electrons with optical phonons was first considered by engelsberg and schrieffer @xcite within migdal s many - body approach for dispersionless phonons .",
    "they predicted a splitting of the optical phonon at finite wavenumbers @xmath17 into two branches .",
    "ipatova and subashiev @xcite calculated later on the optical phonon attenuation in the collisionless limit and pointed out that the brovman - kagan renormalization should be carried out for optical phonons in order to obtain correct phonon renormalization . in the paper @xcite , alexandrov and schrieffer corrected the calculational error of ref.@xcite and argued that no splitting was found in fact .",
    "instead , they predicted an extremely strong dispersion of optical phonons , @xmath18 , due to the coupling to electrons .",
    "the large phonon dispersion is a typical result of migdal s theory @xcite using the frlich hamiltonian .",
    "no such a dispersion has ever been observed experimentally .",
    "the usual dispersion of optical phonons in metals has the order of the sound velocity .",
    "reizer @xcite stressed the importance of screening effects which should be taken into account .",
    "the works @xcite are limited to the case of collisionless both electron and phonon systems . moreover ,",
    "only the phonon renormalization was considered with no results available for the attenuation of optical phonons .    a different from many - body technique semiclassical approach based on the boltzmann equation and",
    "the equations of the theory of elasticity was developed in the papers by akhiezer , silin , gurevich , kontorovich , and many others ( we refer the reader to the review @xcite ) .",
    "this approach was compared with various experiments , such as attenuation of sound waves , effects of strong magnetic fields , crystal anisotropy , and sample surfaces on the sound attenuation , and so on .",
    "it can be applied to the problem of the electron  optical - phonon interaction @xcite as well .    in the previous paper @xcite",
    ", we have developed a quantum theory for the optical phonon attenuation and shift induced by the interband electron transitions and tuned with a temperature variation .",
    "now we consider the optical phonon renormalization as a result of the electron - phonon interaction taking into account ferro - magnetic ordering .",
    "we argue that the reasonable phonon damping and shift can be obtained using the semiclassical boltzmann equation for electrons and the motion equation of phonons coupled by the deformation potential .",
    "we assume that the electron bands in cos@xmath0 have a form shown in fig .",
    "[ bands ] .",
    "the ferromagnetic ordering results in the spin splitting @xmath19 of the unfilled half - metallic band @xmath20 in the effective weiss field @xmath21 . while the temperature decreases , the magnetization , determined in the mean field approximation as @xmath22 appears according to experimental data in cos@xmath0 at @xmath3 k approximately , and the spin splitting is proportional to the magnetization .",
    "we write the interaction of electrons with the optical phonon @xmath23 as the deformation potential @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a number of cells in the volume unit and @xmath26 is the interatomic distance . for the acoustic phonon  electron interaction , we should substitute the strain tensor @xmath27 instead of the displacement @xmath23 in order to satisfy the translation symmetry of the lattice .",
    "the boltzmann equation for the nonequilibrium part of the distribution function @xmath28 has the form @xmath29\\,,\\label{df}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the equilibrium distribution function .",
    "we omit in the boltzmann equation ( [ df ] ) the spin index @xmath31 , which determines all the electron parameters .",
    "the electron collision frequency @xmath32 takes into account the collisions with impurities and phonons .",
    "the collision frequency is calculated for cos@xmath0 in the debye model with the temperature @xmath33 k. one can see from eq.([df ] ) that the condition @xmath34 have to be satisfied in order to obey the current continuity equation , where the brackets mean averaging over the fermi surface for temperatures @xmath35 .    in the ferromagnetic phase while the temperature changes , the carriers overflow from one spin state in another , but the total number of carriers @xmath36 remains to be constant .",
    "this condition determines the chemical potential and the carrier concentration with the spin up and spin down , shown in fig.[rho ] .",
    "all figures correspond here and what follows to the carrier concentration @xmath37 @xmath38 in the considered band with the fermi energy @xmath39 ev above the curie temperature .",
    "let us write the motion equation for the phonon mode in a form @xmath40 where @xmath10 is the reduced ion mass of the cell , @xmath41 is the charge corresponding to the optical vibration , and @xmath42 is the frequency of the considered mode . here",
    ", the last term represents the electron - phonon interaction . using the boltzmann equation ( [ df ] )",
    ", we rewrite this term as follows @xmath43 the term with electric field in the boltzmann equation disappears in the integration over @xmath44 due to the velocity inversion @xmath45 .",
    "the term with the wave vector @xmath46 has to be omitted for the raman phonon , as the vector @xmath46 is determined in this case by the laser frequency @xmath47 and the optical phonon frequency satisfies the condition @xmath48 .",
    "the electric field does not excited in the to vibrations .",
    "therefore , supposing @xmath49 and integrating over the energy @xmath50 instead of @xmath51 , we find from eqs .",
    "( [ ph ] ) and ( [ ph1 ] ) the lineshift @xmath52 and linewidth @xmath53 determined by the electron - phonon interaction as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is an element of the fermi surface , @xmath56 is the fermi velocity .",
    "estimating @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the typical electron energy in metals , we obtain @xmath61    the equations ( [ ph ] ) and ( [ ph1 ] ) allow to express the phonon displacement @xmath62 in terms the electric field @xmath63 and to calculate the phonon contribution @xmath64 into the polarization .",

    "one finds the frequency of the lo mode as follows @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the ion plasma frequency squared .    using eq .",
    "( [ eps ] ) , we find the lo frequency in the presence of carriers as @xmath70 where the electron plasma frequencies squared @xmath71 is supposed to be large in comparison with @xmath72 .",
    "we can put also @xmath73 in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ lo ] ) . here",
    "the last term describes the electric field screened by the free carriers .",
    "the main role plays the first term , which coincides with the result for the to mode , eq .",
    "( [ to ] ) , shown in figs .",
    "[ pos4 ] and [ width4 ] , the results for the klemens channel are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we should emphasize that the temperature dependence of the linewidth and shift , eq .",
    "( [ to ] ) , is determined mainly by the electron collision rate @xmath32 involving also , for instance , in the dc conductivity .",
    "thus , for a cubic crystal , the dc conductivity , i.e. at @xmath74 , writes @xmath75 the details of the electron density of states and of the deformation potential are responsible for peculiarities of the raman line temperature dependence .",
    "the klemens formula describes the optical phonon width due to three - phonon anharmonic interactions . the corresponding lineshift matches with the linewidth . in such ferromagnets as cos@xmath0 with the low curie temperature",
    ", these interactions are found to be too weak to describe quantitatively the experimental data and to explain the very large raman linewidth and shift .",
    "therefore , we propose the mechanism of the electron - phonon interaction attended with the effect of the ferromagnetic ordering on the electron bands .",
    "the deformation potential couples together the boltzmann equation for electrons and the motion equation for phonons producing the renormalization of the phonon frequency . the corresponding raman line width and shift are in agreement with experiments in ref . @xcite .",
