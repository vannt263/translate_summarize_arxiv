    "* geometry of interaction . *   a geometry of interaction ( goi ) construction ,",
    "i.e. a construction that fulfills the goi research program @xcite , is in a first approximation a representation of linear logic proofs that accounts for the dynamics of cut - elimination .",
    "contrarily to denotational semantics , a proof @xmath0 and its normalised form @xmath1 are not represented by the same object , but they remain related through a semantic interpretation of the cut - elimination called the _ execution _ @xmath2 : @xmath3 .",
    "a goi construction hence represents both the proofs and their normalisation ; it is in some ways an untyped variant of game semantics @xcite .",
    "the further aim of geometry of interaction is to reconstruct logical operations from such a dynamic representation of proofs .",
    "the objects of study in a goi construction are actually a generalisation of the notion of proof  sometimes called paraproofs .",
    "this point of view allows a reconstruction of logic as a description of how these objects interact in the same spirit as realisability @xcite : a program is of type @xmath4 because it produces a natural number when given a natural number as an argument . as in game semantics and classical realisability",
    ", one can however describe a necessary condition for being the interpretation of a proof , and defines _ winning paraproofs _ as those objects satisfying it . in spite of their seemingly deep abstraction ,",
    "the goi constructions provide mathematical models which are very close to actual computing . as an illustration of this fact ,",
    "let us mention the _ geometry of synthesis _ program initiated by ghica @xcite .",
    "this research program , inspired by geometry of interaction , aims at obtaining logical synthesis methods for vlsi designs .",
    "* quantitative semantics .",
    "*   quantitative semantics find its origins in girard s work on functor models for lambda - calculus @xcite .",
    "this work , which predates its seminal work on linear logic @xcite and actually inspired it , exhibits for the first time a decomposition of the semantic interpretation of lambda - terms as taylor series .",
    "these series capture a number of information about the time , space , resource consumption of the programs it represents .",
    "quantitative semantics are therefore more involved than so - called _ qualitative _ semantics , since they mirror more information about the programs that are interpreted . recently ,",
    "quantitative semantics has been used to give denotational semantics for various algebraic extensions of lambda calculus such as probabilistic @xcite or differential lambda calculi @xcite .",
    "work by laird , manzonetto , mccusker and pagani on weighted relational models @xcite provides a uniform account of several denotational models accounting for quantitative notions , using a refinement of the relational model .",
    "* interaction graphs .",
    "*   interaction graphs were first introduced by the author @xcite as a combinatorial approach to girard s hyperfinite geometry of interaction @xcite , restricted to the multiplicative fragment of linear logic .",
    "an extension capable to deal with additive connectives was then defined @xcite and shown to abstract not only the ( additive fragment of the ) hyperfinite goi model but all previously introduced goi constructions as well .",
    "both papers proposed a model construction in the spirit of girard s goi construction where proofs were interpreted by graphs instead of infinite operators .",
    "dealing with exponentials however needs one to consider infinite objects .",
    "this is why a third paper @xcite showed how the construction on graphs can be applied when working with a generalisation of graphs named _",
    "graphings_. graphings are in some sense _ geometric realisations _ of graphs on a measure space @xmath5 which were first introduced in the context of ergodic theory @xcite .",
    "this allows not only to consider infinite graphs ( which can be used to define exponentials in the same way as the original goi constructions ) , but also graphs acting on continuous , thus infinite but finite - measure spaces .",
    "this general construction on graphings was shown @xcite to improve on girard s hyperfinite goi @xcite since it allows a satisfactory treatment of second - order quantification .",
    "lastly , a fourth paper @xcite showed how the consideration of graphings can be used to define `` quantitative '' exponential connectives for elementary linear logic @xcite , a fragment of linear logic that captures elementary time computation @xcite .",
    "* unbounded exponentials and quantitative aspects .",
    "*   the author s work on interaction graphs should be understood @xcite as a _ dynamic counterpart _ of weighed relational models by laird _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , i.e. its relation to standard dynamic models ( geometry of interaction , game semantics ) is comparable to weighted relational models relations with standard relational models .",
    "indeed , it provides a uniform construction of models which not only captures all of girard s goi models , but also extends them : while girard s constructions can be understood as interpreting proofs as graphs which , by considering the right basis for @xmath6 correspond to graphs .",
    "] , we here interpret proofs as _ weighted graphs _",
    ", i.e. graphs with weighted edges .",
    "furthermore , interaction graphs models can reflect these quantitative information at the level of types since the latter are built from an _ orthogonality relation _ which can take those weights into account .",
    "indeed , the orthogonality relation is defined through a measurement of cycles @xcite by means of an integral over a finite - measure space  the _ support _ of the cycle . in the simplest cases one",
    "measures a cycle @xmath0 of suppport @xmath7 and weight @xmath8 , along a measurable map @xmath9 , by the following integral : @xmath10    since interaction graphs provide a generalisation of girard s constructions , one could easily adapt the interpretation of exponential connectives from girard s first constructions @xcite to obtain a model of full linear logic .",
    "this adaptation would extend to danos interpretation of pure lambda - calculus in goi @xcite .",
    "however , this interpretation of exponential connectives corresponds to defining @xmath11 as a ( countable ) infinite family of copies of @xmath12 .",
    "thus , even if @xmath12 is represented by a graphing acting on a space of finite measure , its exponentiated version @xmath11 acts on a space of infinite measure .",
    "this fact hinders the quantitative aspects of our model since it creates cycles @xmath0 whose support @xmath7 are spaces of infinite measure . as a consequence ,",
    "the integral defining the orthogonality relation ( definition [ integral ] ) diverges as soon as the weight is not mapped to @xmath13 , i.e. as soon as @xmath14 .",
    "the resulting model is therefore no longer capable of depicting quantitative information .",
    "* contributions . *   we define , in the framework of interaction graphs , exponential connectives for full linear logic in a way that preserves the quantitative aspects of the construction , providing the first dynamic model of second - order linear logic accounting for quantitative aspects . indeed , to the author",
    "s knowledge , there exists no game semantics or goi models for this logical system which include quantitative features .",
    "indeed , although girard s so - called goi3 construction @xcite provides a model of this same logical system , the treatment of exponential connectives in the latter work prevents from any generalisation accounting for quantitative information , as already explained . on the side of game semantics , the quantitative game semantics for linear logic of dal lago and laurent @xcite does not deal with additives and quantifiers and moreover seems more limited than our own models in the range of quantitative features it can accommodate .",
    "moreover , we are able to pinpoint the computational principles ( represented as measurable maps ) that are essential to interpret digging and dereliction , providing new insights on constraint linear logic and their semantics .",
    "formally , this is obtained by exhibiting a single map ",
    "the _ exchange _ @xmath15  which turns a model of into a model of . indeed , as discussed after definition [ microdef ] , removing the exchange restricts our model to the model of based on graphings @xcite .    * outline of the paper .",
    "*   we define exponential connectives along the same lines as in our work on ( thus bounded ) exponentials @xcite , avoiding the involvement of infinite - measure sets . with this definition of exponential connectives , one would however expect only a restriction of linear logic , such as . to bypass this restriction ,",
    "we relax the notion of states .",
    "indeed , the interpretation of proofs in interaction graphs makes use of so - called _ thick graphs _  or _",
    "thick graphings _ in the general framework  , which can be understood as graphs with states .",
    "while previous work considered only finite sets of states , we loosen this definition to allow for infinite yet finite - measure ( actually continuous ) sets of states .",
    "this modification impacts slightly on the basic notions notions and constructions considered in previous work @xcite , for which we introduce adequate generalisations .",
    "these changes , however , do not raise any technical difficulties .",
    "the resulting model is then shown to model digging and dereliction in addition to the principles of elementary linear logic , thus interpreting full linear logic . finally , we discuss the issue of the representation of cut - elimination in the model .",
    "we start by a discussion meant to give intuitions about the basic principles at work in the interaction graphs models .",
    "we illustrate those principles by explaining the notion of _ thick and sliced graphs _ @xcite .",
    "this discussion is quite informal in that we will only provide explicit and complete definitions of the objects and operations that are essential for the understanding of this paper , to avoid overloading the reader with non - essential definitions .",
    "indeed , the actual model uses thick and sliced _",
    "graphings _ , a generalisation needed to accomodate both exponentials and quantifiers . before providing the formal definition of those at the end of the section ,",
    "we discuss the notion of `` graphs with states '' and how it can be generalised to continuous sets of states .",
    "the term `` graph '' will stand for `` directed weighted graphs '' , i.e. directed graphs with a weight function from the set of edges to a monoid of weights @xmath16 .",
    "given a graph @xmath17 , we will always denote @xmath18 its set of edges , @xmath19 its set of vertices , @xmath20 and @xmath21 its target and source maps , and @xmath22 its weight map .",
    "the notion of _ thick _ graphs generalises that of graphs by introducing a set of ( control ) states  called a dialect .",
    "a graph @xmath17 with dialect @xmath23 is nothing more than a graph whose set of vertices is of the form @xmath24  the set @xmath25 is called its _ support_.",
    "@xmath23 then acts as a set of control states when considering the operation of _ execution _ , which represents the cut - elimination procedure . when working with ( non - thick ) graphs ,",
    "this operation is represented as the computation of a graph of alternating paths ; the notion of alternating path between thick graphs gives a particular role to the dialects .",
    "indeed , an alternating path between thick graphs @xmath26 and @xmath27 , with respective dialects @xmath28 and @xmath29 , is a finite sequence of edges @xmath30 and a sequence of triples @xmath31 such that :    ( alternation ) : :    @xmath32 if and only if    @xmath33 ; ( states ) : :    if @xmath34 then    @xmath35 ;    the interpretation of the dialect as a set of ( control ) states comes from the way its elements are dealt with in the above definition . now , given two thick graphs @xmath36 , the intersection of their supports represent a _ cut _ ; the result of the elimination of this cut is called the _ execution _ of @xmath17 and @xmath37 .",
    "it is defined as the thick graph @xmath38 , of support the symmetric difference @xmath39 , of dialect the product @xmath40 , whose edges are exactly the alternating paths between @xmath17 and @xmath37 whose source and target lie outside of the cut .",
    "this is reminiscent of game semantics _ composition and hiding _ : composition corresponds here to the computation of all alternating paths , while hiding corresponds to the restriction to those paths starting and ending outside the cut .",
    "the formal definition of execution , in the framework of graphings , is given at the end of this section .",
    "now , _ thick and sliced graphs _ further extend this notion of thick graphs by considering finite formal weighted sums @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a finite indexing set , the coefficients @xmath43 are real numbers and @xmath44 is a set of thick graphs sharing the same support ( but not sharing the dialects ) .",
    "this notion is crucial for treating additive connectives @xcite .",
    "the operation of execution is then extended `` by linearity '' ( although the sums are not linear combinations ) , letting : @xmath45      interaction graphs models dealing with exponential connectives of linear logic are based on the notion of _ thick and sliced graphings _ , obtained by a second layer of generalisation over this notion of thick and sliced graphs @xcite . while graphings will be introduced formally in the next section ( definition [ graphing ] ) , we provide an intuitive description to discuss this generalisation .",
    "this discussion can be skipped in a first read , as only the formal definition of microcosm is needed to follow the next section .",
    "graphings are in some sense _ geometric realisations _ of graphs on a measure space @xmath5 .",
    "specifically , a graphing @xmath17 is defined as a graph such that for each edge @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are measurable subsets of @xmath5 , and there is a measurable map @xmath49 which _ realises _ @xmath50 . as for graphs , one can define _ thick and sliced graphings _ by first defining thick graphings  graphings with a dialect , then consider formal weighted sums of those .",
    "it is natural , while working with graphings , to consider dialects themselves as measure spaces , and more precisely ( finite ) discrete probability spaces . a thick graphing of dialect @xmath51 is then easily described as a graphing over the measure space @xmath52 .",
    "the purpose of the current work is to extend this definition to allow for _ continuous dialects _ ,",
    "i.e. continuous measure spaces in place of discrete ones .",
    "we will show how to define in this setting the interpretation of second order linear logic without hindering the `` quantitative '' features of the interaction graphs construction .",
    "this however comes with a small drawback in the form of a minor complexification of the framework , which we now explain .",
    "we did not dwell on this point earlier , but thick graphs ( graphs with dialects ) are considered _ _ up to _ _ renaming of their dialect ; a thick graph @xmath17 which is a dialect - renaming of a thick graph @xmath53 is called a _",
    "variant _ of @xmath53 ( definition [ variant ] ) . to define correctly this notion of variant",
    "one needs to consider bijections between the dialects .",
    "however , when considering graphings and replacing the dialects with possibly continuous probability spaces , we face a problem when considering the following two probability spaces : @xmath54 with discrete measure , and @xmath55}$ ] with lebesgue measure . indeed , any thick graphing @xmath17 with dialect @xmath56 has a variant @xmath37 with dialect @xmath55}$ ] : each element @xmath57 is represented by the interval @xmath58 $ ] , and an edge of source @xmath59 and target @xmath60 realised by a map @xmath61 in @xmath17 is realised in @xmath37 by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the translation @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the map @xmath66 underlying is discrete , any measurable map @xmath67 is defined from a measurable map @xmath68 by @xmath69 . ]",
    "however , this can not be formalised through an adequate notion of bijection : here we would expect _ borel isomorphisms _ since we work with measure spaces , but no such isomorphism exists between @xmath56 and @xmath71}}}$ ] . to avoid these troubles",
    ", we will therefore consider all our dialects to be isomorphic to @xmath71}}}$ ] with its lebesgue measure .",
    "since , as we just explained , a graphing with discrete dialect always has a `` variant '' with @xmath71}}}$ ] as dialect , and since thick graphings are considered _ up to _ renaming , this restriction is seamless .",
    "the second change from earlier work @xcite is that we need to consider an extension of the notion of _ microcosm_. a microcosm @xmath72 was defined as a monoid of measurable maps @xmath73 used to consider `` restrictions '' of the model to @xmath72-graphings : graphings whose realisers ",
    "i.e.  the maps that realises edges  are restrictions of maps in @xmath72 .",
    "this original notion of microcosm did not incorporate the dialect .",
    "this is explained by the fact that the latter was discrete , and therefore any measurable maps realising an edge in a thick graphing could be described as a product of a measurable maps from @xmath5 to @xmath5 with a partial bijection on the dialect .",
    "now that we allow for continuous dialects , one can consider realisers of edges that do not simply arise in this way from ) and which is needed to interpret both digging and dereliction . ]",
    "a map @xmath73 .",
    "the following definition therefore adapts ( in fact extends ) the previously considered notion of microcosm in a very natural way in order to incorporate this change .",
    "let us stress that for technical reasons discussed in earlier work @xcite , the measurable maps considered should be non - singular transformations be a measure space .",
    "a measurable map @xmath74 is non - singular when @xmath75 . ] which are measurable - preserving , i.e. map measurable sets to measurable sets .",

    "this section is meant to recall the main results of previous work @xcite , to which we refer the reader for a complete picture .",
    "we first define weighted ( thick ) graphings , a generalisation of the homonymous notion considered by adams @xcite and later by gaboriau @xcite .    [ graphing ]",

    "morally , graphings are sort of graphs which offer richer combinatorics since two vertices might have a non - trivial intersection without being equal .",
    "in particular , when considering paths , one should be careful about the sources and targets : a path in a graphing @xmath17 is a sequence of edges @xmath97 in @xmath18 such that not only @xmath98 is non - negligible for every @xmath99 , but also verifying that every sequence @xmath100 is of strictly positive measure .",
    "this path is then naturally realised as the composite @xmath101 , and is considered with its _ maximal domain _",

    "we can then define _ alternating path _ between thick graphings as in the case of graphs , and introduce the operation of _ execution _ between thick graphings , the semantic counterpart to the cut - elimination procedure .",

    "one of the key aspects of interaction graphs is their ability to accomodate quantitative aspects .",
    "formally , recent work by the author @xcite relates the models ( for multiplicative linear logic ) obtained by the interaction graphs construction to so - called weighted relational models by laird _ et al .",
    "it is thus natural to expect interaction graphs models of various classical quantitative models of computation such as probabilistic computation .",
    "it appears however that the construction is flexible enough to allow for the study of a much larger class of `` quantitative aspects '' , as illustrated by two quite different examples that we now discuss : kennedy s units of measure @xcite , and ghica and smith s bounded linear types @xcite .",
    "we will limit the discussions of these examples here either to simply typed lambda - calculus , although the model is more expressive .",
    "detailed study of the models in whole would lead us out of the scope of this paper , and should be the subject of future work .",
    "one of the most straightforward examples is the work by kennedy @xcite introducing types systems dealing with the notion of _ units_. here , the set of units one wants to deal with , e.g. meters , seconds squared , meters per second , is represented as an ( abelian ) group @xmath275 .",
    "then , types are considered dependent upon elements of this group , and one is allowed to consider the type of meters @xmath276 $ ] or the type of functions from masses to energies ( such as multiplication by a squared velocity for instance ) .",

    "for instance , multiplication of natural numbers could be typed as @xmath277\\times\\nat[u']\\rightarrow\\nat[uu']$ ] .",
    "now , if one considers the interaction graph model described in this paper in which the monoid @xmath16 is replaced by the chosen abelian group of units @xmath275 , then we can easily interpret unit - dependent types and quantification over units .",
    "a very naive way to do so consists in appending to the interpretation of a term a single edge on a measurable subset used and reserved for the sole purpose of interpreting units , and weight this edge with the appropriate unit . for instance , a natural number of type @xmath278 $ ] ( resp . of type",
    "@xmath276 $ ] ) will just be the usual interpretation of the natural number extended by a single edge of weight @xmath279 ( resp . of weight @xmath128 ) .",
    "moreover , polymorphism is here something we get for free , using the same methods as for second - order quantification : the type @xmath280 $ ] is simply interpreted as the conduct @xmath281 $ ] .    further to this limited setting of kennedy s unit of measures type system , this same interpretation also provides models of bounded linear types",
    ". bounded linear types were introduced by ghica and smith @xcite as a generalisation of girard , scedrov and scott s bounded linear logic @xcite , a variation of linear logic that accounts for polynomial time computation .",
    "the definition of a bounded linear type system is dependent upon a resource semiring @xmath282 .",
    "it is clear that the underlying monoid @xmath283 could be chosen as the weight monoid in our models without hidering the naive interpretation considered above .",
    "thus , the only real challenge lies in the interpretation of the sum of the semiring , which is used only in the contraction rule .",
    "but one can choose to represent the sum through a splitting of the dialect @xmath207 $ ] .",
    "this leads to a correct interpretation of the ( exponential ) contraction rule since @xmath173 will map an element of the tensor in @xmath284 to an element of @xmath285 .",
    "in particular , it will take the two single edges encoding the elements of @xmath286 and superimposing them using the dialect , creating the exact situation we chose for interpreting the sum .",
    "another way of thinking about this naive interpretation is that all that is needed to interpret these type systems is a single conduct @xmath287 which possesses subconducts ( i.e.  subtypes ) that can be used to simulate algebraic operations in the group @xmath275 ( for units of measure ) or in the semiring @xmath286 ( for bounded linear types ) . using notations from previous papers",

    "in particular , the possibility to restrict or expand the ways map can act on the dialect through the microcosm can be of interest in terms of computational complexity .",
    "indeed , while the weight monoid and the measurement of weights seem to be related to different computational paradigms and can be used , for instance , for representing probabilistic computation , the microcosm can be used to restrict the computational principles allowed in the model and characterise in this way various complexity classes @xcite .",
    "all characterisations considered in the cited work were based on variants of exponential connectives satisfying at least the contraction principle . in the more general construction explained here , we are now able to consider models of exponentials that do not satisfy this principle . in this line of work , it would be interesting to understand if one can adapt mazza and terui s work on parsimonious lambda - calculus @xcite , and obtain an interaction graph model for it .",
