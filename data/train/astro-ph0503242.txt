    "the recent observations of high redshift supernovae @xcite , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropies @xcite and the shape of the matter power spectrum @xcite consistently support the idea that our universe is currently undergoing an epoch of accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "currently , the debate is centered on when did the acceleration actually start and what agent is driving it .",
    "a variety of models based on at least two matter components ( baryonic and dark ) and one dark energy component ( with negative pressure ) have been suggested -see @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9cdm model , where a vacuum energy density or cosmological constant provides the negative pressure , was the earliest and simplest to be analyzed .",
    "while this model is consistent with the observational data ( high redshift supernova @xcite , cmb anisotropies @xcite , galaxy cluster evolution @xcite ) , at the fundamental level it fails to be convincing : the vacuum energy density falls below the value predicted by any sensible quantum field theory by many orders of magnitude @xcite , and it unavoidably leads to the _ coincidence problem _ ,",
    "i.e. ,  why are the vacuum and matter energy densities of precisely the same order today ? \" @xcite .",
    "more sophisticated models replace @xmath9 by a dynamical dark energy either in the form of a scalar field ( quintessence ) , tachyon field , phantom field or chaplygin gas .",
    "these models fit the observational data but it is doubtful that they solve the coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been proposed that dark matter and dark energy are coupled and do not evolve separately @xcite .",
    "in particular the interacting quintessence ( iq ) models of references @xcite , aside from fitting rather well the high redshift supernovae data , quite naturally solve the coincidence problem by requiring the ratio of matter and dark energy densities to be constant at late times .",
    "the coupling between matter and quintessence is either motivated by high energy particle physics considerations @xcite or is constructed by requiring the final matter to dark energy ratio to be stable against perturbations @xcite .",
    "since the nature of dark matter and dark energy are unknown there are no physical arguments to exclude their interaction . on the contrary , arguments in favor of such interaction have been suggested @xcite . as a result of the interaction ,",
    "the matter density drops with the scale factor @xmath10 more slowly than @xmath11 .",
    "a slower matter density evolution fits the supernovae data as well as the @xmath9cdm concordance model does @xcite .",
    "the interaction also alters the age of the universe , the evolution of matter and radiation perturbations and gives rise to a different matter and radiation power spectra .",
    "all these effects will be used to set constraints on the decay rate of the scalar field using cosmological observations . in this paper",
    ", we shall further constrain the chimento et al .",
    "@xcite model by using the recently wmap measurements of the cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropies .",
    "as it turns out , a small but non - vanishing interaction between dark matter and dark energy is compatible with the wmap data with the advantage of solving the coincidence problem . to some extent ,",
    "this was already suggested in a recent analysis that uses the position of the peaks and troughs of the cmb @xcite to constrain a general class of interacting models designed not to strictly solve the coincidence problem , but to alleviate it @xcite .",
    "briefly , the outline of the paper is : in section ii we summarize the cosmological model , in section iii we derive the equations of dark matter and dark energy density perturbations and find the range of parameter space that best fits the observations ; finally , in section iv we discuss our main results and present our conclusions .",
    "the iq model considered here has been constructed to solve the coincidence problem by introducing a coupling between matter and dark energy ; their respective energy densities do nt evolve independently . in this paper , we shall simplify the chimento _",
    "model @xcite in the sense that the iq will be assumed to decay into cold dark matter ( cdm ) and not into baryons , as required by the constraints imposed by local gravity measurements @xcite the baryon ",
    "photon fluid evolves independently of the cdm and quintessence components . unlike @xcite",
    ", we do not include dissipative effects . in @xcite",
    "this scaling was considered only during matter domination , so the scalar field would evolve independently of the cdm component until it started to decay at some early time .",
    "these assumptions facilitate the numerical work while they preserve its essential features .",
    "specifically , the quintessence field ( denoted by a subscript @xmath12 ) decays into pressureless cdm ( subscript @xmath13 ) according to @xcite + @xmath14 + where @xmath15 is the equation of state parameter of the dark energy and @xmath16 is a small dimensionless constant parameter that measures the intensity of the interaction .",
    "approaches similar ( but not identical ) to ours have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "( [ cont ] ) were not derived assuming some particle physics model for the interaction , where quintessence is described as an scalar field with a given potential .",
    "we followed a phenomenological approach and instead we have required the interacting quintessence model to solve the coincidence problem .",
    "we have imposed the dark matter to dark energy density interaction to give a dark matter to dark energy ratio constant at late times and stable against perturbations . as a result ,",
    "the shape of the scalar field potential is also fixed .",
    "( [ cont ] ) can be solved by laplace transforming the system .",

    "interacting models have larger dark energy density in the past than non - interacting models , achieving the same rate of accelerated expansion today with a smaller @xmath21 .",
    "our best model also requires larger baryon fraction since the matter density is smaller prior to recombination than in the concordance model , therefore dark matter potential wells are shallower and a higher baryon fraction is required to reproduce the amplitude of the first acoustic peak @xcite .",

    "the discrepancy among the models is clearer at the first acoustic peak .",
    "this rigging introduces a high degeneracy among cosmological parameters since very different models fit the data with similar @xmath119 per degree of freedom . when adding other data sets , like the supernovae in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour]c , the fraction of dark energy increases dramatically .",

    "there is a significant difference between the concordance model and our best fit model .",
    "since the latter requires lower hubble constant and dark energy density , it generates a smaller integrated sachs wolfe effect , responsible for the rise of the radiation power spectrum at @xmath124 .",
    "this is a generic feature of this type of iq models and , therefore , the low amplitude of the measured quadrupole and octupole is less of a problem in models with decaying dark energy than in the concordance model .",

    "the best model , @xmath125 , fits the data significantly better than models with no interaction .",
    "our best fit model requires cosmological parameters , in particular @xmath23 and @xmath78 , that are very different from the concordance model .",

    "[ fig : contour ] ) but including prior information from supernovae data shifts this parameter close to the concordance model @xmath127 .",
    "we wish to emphasize that the non - interacting model ( @xmath128 ) is only compatible with wmap data at @xmath129 confidence level , but when the supernovae data are included this is shifted to @xmath130 confidence level .",
    "we have shown that the bayesian information criteria , that strongly disfavors increasing the parameter space to describe data sets of @xmath131 points , provides positive evidence in favor of the existence of interaction .",
    "other iq models have been proposed @xcite and even if their results are not directly comparable to ours , two interacting models , constructed with different motivations , suggest a value of the dark energy density smaller than in the concordance model , signals a need to investigate this type of models . as we have discussed , the quality of the fit and the cosmological parameters that can be derived by fitting cosmological models to observations depend on the parameter space explored .",
    "the fact that iq models appear to be favored by current observations suggests that dark energy and dark matter might not be so different entities after all .",
    "this is in line with recent ideas involving the chaplygin gas .",
    "there , a single component plays the dual role of cold dark matter ( at early times ) and vacuum energy ( at late times ) and it interpolates between the two as expansion proceeds @xcite",
    ". the matter power spectrum could also be an important test of iq models .",
    "a preliminary study shows that for the range of parameter space compatible with wmap , the effect of the scalar field decaying into cdm has little effect @xcite .",
    "to summarize , the interacting cosmology model fits the wmap data significantly better than the @xmath9cdm model does , and in fact alleviates the isw effect at large angular scales , has no coincidence problem and provides a unified picture of dark matter and dark energy .",
    "it predicts lower values of hubble constant , dark energy density and higher baryon fraction .",
    "it is to be expected that the next generation of cmb experiments @xcite and large scale surveys will enable us to constrain @xmath16 even further and discriminate between the different variants .",

    "<S> we determine the range of parameter space of a interacting quintessence model that best fits the recent wmap measurements of cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropies . </S>",
    "<S> we only consider cosmological models with zero spatial curvature . </S>",
    "<S> we show that if the quintessence scalar fields decays into cold dark matter at a rate that brings the ratio of matter to dark energy constant at late times , the cosmological parameters required to fit the cmb data are : dark energy density @xmath0 , baryon fraction @xmath1 , slope of the matter power spectrum at large scales @xmath2 and hubble constant @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the data prefers a dark energy component with a dimensionless decay rate parameter @xmath4 and non - interacting models are consistent with the data only at the 99.9% confidence level . using the bayesian information criteria we show that this extra parameter fits the data better than models with no interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the quintessence equation of state parameter is less constrained ; i.e. , the data sets an upper limit @xmath5 at the same level of significance . </S>",
    "<S> when the wmap anisotropy data are combined with supernovae data , the density parameter of dark energy increases to @xmath6 while @xmath7 augments to @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> models with quintessence decaying into dark matter provide a clean explanation for the coincidence problem and are a viable cosmological model , compatible with observations of the cmb , with testable predictions . </S>",
    "<S> accurate measurements of baryon fraction and/or of matter density independent of the cmb data , would support / disprove these models . </S>"
