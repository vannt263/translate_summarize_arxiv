    "since its first observation by kohlrausch in 1847  @xcite , stretched - exponential relaxation has been observed in the time - dependent relaxation of several ( elastic , dielectric , electronic ) macroscopic observables in nearly all structurally disordered solids .",
    "ultimately , this behaviour represents one of the most common hallmarks of irreversibility in disordered systems . over the last century , stretched - exponentials have been used in countless experimental settings to fit experimental data .",
    "although it is common knowledge that stretched - exponential relaxation relates somehow to spatially heterogeneous many - body interactions or to heterogeneous distribution of activation energy barriers  @xcite , only very few models or theories are able to predict stretched - exponential relaxation from first - principle dynamics  @xcite .",
    "in fact , strictly speaking , only two models recover stretched - exponential relaxation in well - defined specific situations .",
    "one is a model of electronic relaxation via non - radiative exciton - hole recombination where holes are randomly distributed traps that `` eat up '' the diffusing excitons  @xcite . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , according to this model the density of not - yet trapped excitons decays at long times as @xmath1 , which gives a kohlrausch exponent @xmath2 in 3d . in spite of the elegance of this model",
    ", it is not straightforward to apply it to elucidate kohlrausch relaxation in glasses .",
    "the other model is the mode - coupling theory ( mct ) of supercooled liquids , which gives a solution that can be approximated with a stretched - exponential for the intermediate scattering function at temperatures well above the glass transition  @xcite",
    ".    clearly , these two models are quite specific and limited in their applicability  @xcite . for example , starting with kohlrausch original experiment using the leyden glass jar , most of the physical systems where stretched - exponential behaviour has been observed are represented by disordered solids , well below the glass transition where mct is no longer applicable .",
    "this is a very important topic in electrical engineering , where dielectric insulators in the solid state are typically employed for all high - voltage transmission applications  @xcite .",
    "hence , while stretched - exponential relaxation is ubiquitous in the solid - state , it has not been possible to trace it back to a well - defined mechanism in the many - body dynamics , or to a well - defined microscopic descriptor of the dynamics . in this letter , we re - examine the problem from the point of view of lattice dynamics , suitably evaluated for a model of disordered solids .",
    "focusing on the paradigmatic case of dielectric relaxation , it is shown that stretched - exponential decay of the dielectric modulus over many decades in time is recovered by the numerical solution to the lorentz sum - rule with a dos that takes into account the crucial role of so - called boson - peak modes over the debye @xmath3 law .",
    "since the origin of these modes lies in the ioffe - regel crossover  @xcite at which phonons are scattered off by the disorder ( in particular , by the absence of inversion - symmetry of the lattice  @xcite ) , it is possible to establish a direct link between stretched - exponential relaxation and the quasi - localization of phonons by the disorder at the boson peak .",
    "in the following , we work within the assumption of disordered elastically bound classical charges , which is the same as the goldhaber - teller model originally developed to explain the giant dipole resonance in atomic nuclei  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "schematically depicted in fig.1 , two types of charges , positive and negative ( or , equivalently , positive and neutral , as in the goldhaber - teller model for nuclei ) , are inter - dispersed randomly in space .",
    "every positive charge is surrounded by nearest - neighbours ( which are negative , or neutral ) , to each of which it is bound by an attractive harmonic potential . in a dielectric solid or in a supercooled ionic liquid  @xcite ,",
    "an attraction minimum around which harmonic approximation can be taken , may come from a superposition of electrostatic attraction and van der waals attraction , competing with short - range steric repulsion ( while in the original goldhaber - teller model the attraction comes , evidently , from the strong nuclear force ) .        in order to evaluate the dielectric response ( below ) on the basis of lattice dynamics , we make use of a dos @xmath4 obtained by numerical diagonalization of a model random lattice of harmonically - bound spherical particles .",
    "this random network is obtained by driving a dense lennard - jones liquid into a metastable glassy energy minimum with a monte - carlo relaxation algorithm , and then replacing all the nearest - neighbour pairs with harmonic springs all of the same spring constant , and with a relatively narrow spring - length distribution  @xcite .",
    "springs are then cut at random in the lattice to generate random lattices with variable mean coordination @xmath5 , from @xmath6 down to the isostatic maxwell limit @xmath7 .",
    "it is important to notice that this simplified model dos is applicable only to systems where the building blocks are spherical and interact with central - force potentials .",
    "the dos obtained from numerical diagonalization of the simulated network is expressed in terms of dimensionless eigenfrequencies @xmath8 .    in this random assembly of particles , only nearest - neighbour interactions are present , and the number @xmath5 represents the average coordination number or average number of nearest - neighbours per particle . also , the dos obtained from diagonalization of the model random networks , depends sensitively on the average coordination number @xmath5 .",
    "for example , the boson peak frequency drifts towards lower values of @xmath8 upon increasing @xmath5 , according to the scaling @xmath9 , as observed also in random packings  @xcite .",
    "this behaviour is also consistent with the common observation that in glasses the boson peak frequency shifts to lower frequency upon increasing the density or the pressure  @xcite .",
    "hence , @xmath5 is the crucial control parameter of the relaxation process , which , in a real e.g. molecular glass , changes with @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , in order to use our numerical dos data in the evaluation of the dielectric function , we need to find a physically meaningful relation between @xmath5 and @xmath10 at the glass transition .    in all experimental systems which measure the @xmath10-dependent material response , the temperature is varied at constant pressure , which implies that thermal expansion is important .",
    "following previous work , we thus employ thermal expansion ideas  @xcite to relate @xmath5 and @xmath10 . upon introducing the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath11 and replacing the total volume @xmath12 of the sample via the volume fraction @xmath13 occupied by the molecules",
    "( @xmath14 is the volume of one molecule ) , upon integration we obtain @xmath15 .",
    "approximating @xmath16 locally , we get @xmath17 . imposing that @xmath18 , as for fcc crystals at @xmath19 in accordance with nernst third - law principle",
    ", we finally get , for the example of glycerol , @xmath20 when @xmath21 .",
    "this is very close to the reported @xmath22 for this material   @xcite . for @xmath23 and @xmath24 ,",
    "the corresponding temperatures are calculated to be @xmath25 and @xmath26 .     at @xmath27 , i.e. close to the marginal stability limit @xmath28 that we identify here as the solid - liquid ( glass ) transition , @xmath29 , which are marked as solid , dashed , dotdashed and dotted lines respectively.,width=328,height=215 ]",
    "law , for ( from bottom to top ) : @xmath30 , which gives evidence of the boson peak at low @xmath31 .",
    "the eigenfrequency of boson peak scales as @xmath32 as known from work for disordered systems with cental - force interactions  @xcite.,width=328,height=215 ]    it is seen in fig.2 that for the case @xmath27 , i.e. very close to the solid - liquid rigidity transition that occurs at @xmath28 , a strong boson peak is present in the dos .",
    "the continuum debye regime @xmath3 is not visible or absent , whereas an infinitesimal gap between @xmath33 and the lowest eigenfrequency exists . hence , under conditions close to the glass transition , the vibrational spectrum is dominated by soft modes at low frequency . upon increasing @xmath5 , the extent of soft modes at low frequency decreases markedly while the debye @xmath34 regime extends to higher frequencies . at the highest @xmath5 values , the relics of van hove singularities that characterize fcc crystals become visible , because medium - range order has to increase upon increasing the coordination @xmath5",
    "@xcite , towards the fcc limit @xmath35 .",
    "in particular , the local degree of centrosymmetry of the nearest - neighbours is the crucial form of order which increases upon increasing @xmath5 and correlates directly with the boson peak  @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath36 for fcc is independent of density only if the thermal fluctuations are neglected ( as is the case at @xmath19 or for athermal systems , e.g. hard spheres ) . at a finite @xmath10 , defects are created by thermal excitations which may lower the total average @xmath5 . upon further increasing @xmath10 ,",
    "amorphous regions are formed with @xmath37 , until the fcc crystal either melts or undergoes a transition into a fully amorphous glass ( crystal - glass transition ) . in fig.3 , the increase of the boson peak ( normalized by the debye level @xmath3 ) upon decreasing @xmath5 is plotted , and the boson - peak frequency dependence on @xmath5 is shown in the inset .",
    "in order to determine the dependence of the polarization and of the dielectric function on the frequency of the field , we have to describe the displacement @xmath38 of each molecule from its own equilibrium position under the applied field @xmath39 . upon treating the dynamics classically",
    ", the equation of motion for a charge @xmath40 under the forces coming from interactions with other charges and from the applied electric filed , is given by the following phenomenological lorentz damped oscillator equation  @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the ( effective ) mass of the charged group , and @xmath43 is its net electric charge .",
    "the hessian @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the total potential energy of the system , represents the restoring attractive interactions from oppositely - charged nearest - neighbour charges , that tend to bring the charge @xmath40 back to the rest position that @xmath40 had at zero - field .",
    "@xmath46 is a phenomenological damping coefficient due to local frictional collisions in the dense glassy environment . to solve this equation ,",
    "the first step is to take the fourier transform : @xmath47 , resulting in the equation : @xmath48    we then implement normal - mode decomposition : @xmath49 , where the hat is used to denote the coefficient of the projected quantity , and @xmath50 denotes an eigenvector of the hessian matrix .",
    "thus the equation of motion is rewritten as @xmath51 where @xmath8 denotes the @xmath52-th normal mode frequency .",
    "the equation is solved by @xmath53    upon multiplying through by the eigenvector @xmath50 , we go back to a vector equation for the fourier - transformed displacement of particle @xmath40 : @xmath54    each particle contributes to the polarization a moment @xmath55 . in order to evaluate the macroscopic polarization , we need to add together the contributions from all microscopic degrees of freedom in the system , @xmath56 . in order to do this analytically",
    ", we use the standard procedure of replacing the discrete sum over the total @xmath57 degrees of freedom of the solid with the continuous integral over the eigenfrequencies @xmath8 , @xmath58 , which gives the following sum rule in integral form for the polarization in glasses @xmath59\\widetilde{\\uline{e}}(\\omega).\\ ] ]    here , @xmath4 is the vibrational dos , and @xmath60 is the cut - off debye frequency arising from the normalization of the density of states .",
    "the complex dielectric permittivity @xmath61 is defined as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the dielectric susceptibility which connects polarization and electric field as  @xcite : @xmath64 . hence , we obtain the complex dielectric function expressed as a frequency integral as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is an arbitrary positive constant , @xmath67 , and @xmath60 is the debye cut - off frequency ( i.e. the highest eigenfrequency in the vibrational dos spectrum ) . as one can easily verify , if @xmath4 were given by a dirac delta , one would recover the standard simple - exponential ( debye ) relaxation  @xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that , in eq.(5 ) , low - frequency soft modes which are present in @xmath4 necessarily play an important role also at low applied - field frequencies @xmath68 , because of the @xmath69 term in the denominator . as we will see below",
    ", this fact in our theory implies a direct role of the boson peak on the @xmath70-relaxation process ( i.e. on the so - called @xmath70-peak which is the main resonance peak of the loss dielectric modulus ) .    since we are using a dos obtained numerically from a system with a finite ( @xmath71 ) number of particles in our numerical simulation of the model system , it is important to correctly take care of finite size effects in eq.(5 ) . in numerical simulations of a finite system ,",
    "the dos @xmath4 is not a continuous function , but discrete .",
    "thus , we rewrite eq.(5 ) as a sum rule over a discrete distribution of @xmath31 : @xmath72 where @xmath66 has absorbed the scaling constant and we have replaced the density of states by the discrete sum of @xmath73functions . since the dielectric function is a complex quantity , we can split it into its real and imaginary parts , i.e. @xmath74 : @xmath75 here , @xmath76 are re - scaling constants that have to be calibrated to adjust the height of the curves . + as remarked above and as observed in numerical calculations of the dos in the vicinity of the mechanical stability point of disordered solids , there exits a lowest non - zero eigenfrequency @xmath77 and a vanishingly small gap between @xmath33 and @xmath78 for @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath79 , @xmath80 becomes @xmath81",
    "we now present our theoretical predictions based on the goldhaber - teller model evaluated with the dos of fig.2 , and compare them with the response calculated based on the best - matching kohlrausch stretched - exponential function . in fig .",
    "4 - 5 using eq .",
    "( 7)-(8 ) .",
    "we plotted the comparisons for @xmath82 at @xmath27 , ( @xmath83 , i.e. slightly below @xmath22 , obtained by implementing the numerical dos of fig.2 ) @xmath84 and @xmath6 in eq.(7 ) .",
    "the scaling parameters for @xmath27 are chosen such that @xmath82 calibrates with experimental data for glycerol at the glass transition from ref .",
    "@xcite ( presented elsewhere ) .",
    "the parameters that control the height of curve ( the @xmath66 parameters ) for other @xmath5 values are selected such that the curves height is the same .",
    "for the other parameter in the model like @xmath85 , the values are the same for all @xmath5 .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "4 that , as @xmath5 increases , the curves of @xmath82 shift towards the right hand side , with the stretched exponential character of the response decreasing accordingly .",
    "importantly , for @xmath27 the stretched - exponential character of the response is very well recovered by our model over the entire time - domain . in fig .",
    "5 we present fittings of the dielectric loss , @xmath80 . also , in this case , the @xmath70-relaxation wing typical of stretched - exponential relaxation with the paradigmatic exponent @xmath86 well within the range observed in many systems  @xcite , is perfectly reproduced over 6 orders of magnitude in frequency . on the left - hand ascending side of the peak ,",
    "our model is dominated by the vanishingly small gap between the zero - modes and the lowest boson - peak eigenmode @xmath77 , which leads to the power - law , @xmath87 as derived in eq.(9 ) , for the ascending part of the peak . on the high-@xmath68 side of the peak , where the dynamics is dominated by the soft boson - peak modes ,",
    "the dos is approximately flat as a function of @xmath8 in fig.2 .",
    "let us now consider the dielectric loss modulus @xmath80 .",
    "upon increasing @xmath5 , the stretched - exponential character of the response also in this case shrinks in the frequency axis and the response deviates from stretched - exponential at higher frequencies .",
    "this general trend , of stretched - exponential character becoming confined to smaller frequency range upon increasing @xmath5 , can be explained by recalling that upon increasing @xmath5 our model random lattice becomes increasingly more ordered , as reflected in the growing of the debye - law regime in the dos and also in the emergence of relics of van hove singularities . in particular , in this model the increase of @xmath5 is accompanied by a marked increase of the local degree of centrosymmetry of nearest - neighbours around a tagged particles as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .     of the applied field .",
    "solid lines are our theory , eq .",
    "the dashed lines are the real part of the fourier transform when we consider the best - fitting stretched - exponential function with @xmath88 respectively . from left to right , each relates to @xmath89 and @xmath24 .",
    "we have taken @xmath90 .",
    "rescaling constant is used to adjust the height of the curves.,width=321,height=215 ]     respectively . from left to right , each relates to @xmath89 and @xmath24 .",
    "we have taken @xmath90 .",
    "rescaling constant is used to adjust the height of the curves.,width=321,height=215 ]    finally , we consider the dielectric response in the time domain .",
    "the time dependent dielectric function @xmath91 and complex dielectric function @xmath92 are related as : @xmath93    by using the fourier inversion theorem , we can write the analytical form of @xmath91 as follows : @xmath94 where @xmath95 , while @xmath96 is a re - scaling constant .",
    "this equation is a key result : it provides a direct and quantitative relation between the macroscopic relaxation function of the material and the dos .",
    "as we show below , the presence of a boson peak in @xmath4 directly causes stretched - exponential decay in @xmath91 via eq.(12 ) .",
    "further , if the dos is nothing but a dirac delta centered at a given einstein frequency @xmath97 ( as in the einstein model of solids  @xcite ) , then the integral of eq .",
    "( 5 ) gives , for the imaginary part , a simple lorentzian curve with a symmetric peak centered on @xmath97 which is the resonance frequency of the system . upon performing the inverse fourier transform ,",
    "one recovers a simple exponential relaxation in the time domain , i.e. @xmath98 with some characteristic time @xmath99 , as in debye relaxation  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "6 , we plot predictions of eq.(12 ) with the parameters calibrated in the glycerol data fitting , along with the kohlrausch function  @xcite , for the relaxation in the time domain .",
    "it is seen that for @xmath27 our theory based on soft modes is able to perfectly recover stretched - exponential relaxation , with stretching - exponent @xmath86 , over the entire time - domain . without the boson - peak modes in the dos , we have checked that stretched - exponential relaxation can not be recovered at all , and the decay is simple - exponential .",
    "hence , our eq.(12 ) provides the long - sought cause - effect relationship between soft modes and stretched - exponential relaxation . for higher values of @xmath5 , also in this case the stretched - exponential character of our theoretical model decreases , although for e.g. @xmath100 the relaxation predicted by our theory is still very close to stretched - exponential .     respectively , that are closest to our theoretical curves . from right to left side , @xmath101 .",
    "rescaling constants are used to adjust the height of the curves.,width=321,height=215 ]",
    "we have studied a classical goldhaber - teller model of a disordered dielectric where particles are placed at random in the lattice and interact harmonically with nearest - neighbours of opposite charge by making two assumptions in our model system : ( 1 ) electric charges are elastically bonded by harmonic springs .",
    "( 2 ) the damping force with constant damping coefficient is assumed in the particle motion .",
    "the assumption ( 1 ) of electric charges being bound to other nearby opposite charges via harmonic springs is essential to describe the dynamics via the hessian matrix and normal modes .",
    "this assumption is an approximation for dielectrics , e.g. organic glasses , where the partially negatively charged segments ( which bear a partial negative charge ) are elastically bound to the partially positively charged segments via attractive interactions . in particular , a partially negatively charged segment is bound via covalent bonding plus electrostatic attraction to a positively charged segment of the same molecule .",
    "it can also be attracted to a positively charged segment of a different molecule via either electrostatic attraction or van der waals attraction , or both .",
    "these attractive interactions are typically longer ranged ( e.g. screened - coulomb attraction ) , whereas repulsive steric interaction due to closed - shell electron pauli repulsion are short - ranged and typically decay exponentially according to quantum mechanics .",
    "hence a charged segment occupies a local minimum of interaction energy . in the linear response regime , where only small displacements from the minimum are considered ,",
    "the charge can be approximated as a harmonic oscillator , independently of the precise shape of the interaction energy landscape but provided that the minimum is steep enough .",
    "the same approximation may apply to ionic liquids .",
    "the assumption ( 2 ) , which introduces a damping coefficient in the equation of motion , is an assumption of the lorentz oscillator model in electrodynamics .",
    "this assumption accounts for the drag force that a charge encounters while it oscillates in the potential minimum well .",
    "this drag force , which effectively dampens the motion , is due to the collisions and to the coupling with other molecular segments or other vibrating molecules nearby . clearly , this is a phenomenological coefficient , which however can be derived from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics , e.g. from so - called caldeira - leggett models .",
    "the vibrational density of states of disordered solids is dominated by an excess of low - energy modes that contributes the so - called boson - peak above the debye law in the dos .",
    "working with the standard lorentz sum rules and implementing the dos of a model disordered solid , we have derived expressions for the dielectric function and the dielectric relaxation which account for the disordered structure . in this model , the coordination number @xmath5 controls the extent of the boson peak and the vicinity to the maxwell rigidity transition @xmath28 ( that could be identified with a glass transition if @xmath5 is related to temperature , e.g. via thermal expansion ) . for the condition closest to the transition that we studied",
    ", we found strikingly that the dielectric response of our model system exhibits perfect kohlrausch stretched - exponential behaviour in both frequency and time domain , over the entire range of frequency and time .",
    "the stretched - exponential character decreases with increasing the average number of nearest - neigbours @xmath5 and gets confined to smaller range of frequency / time due to the fact that structural order ( in particular , the local centrosymmetry  @xcite ) increases upon increasing @xmath5 in our model .",
    "this framework shows , for the first time , that stretched - exponential relaxation in glasses is directly caused by the quasi - localized boson - peak modes contribution to the lattice dynamics .",
    "these results open up new opportunities to understand the crucial link between @xmath70-relaxation , boson peak and dynamical heterogeneity in glasses .",
    "the response in the time domain is related to the response in the frequency domain  @xcite @xmath102 the relaxation function is related to the response in the time domain via  @xcite : @xmath103 where @xmath104}$ ] .",
    "predictions of this equation have also been plotted for comparison in fig . 2 - 3 , for the frequency - dependent response , and in fig . 4 for the time - dependent response , together with the predictions of our theory .",
    "note that the parameters in the kohlrausch model have been also adjusted to match with the experimental data ."
