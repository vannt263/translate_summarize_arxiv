    ", some real physical systems that display synchronized phenomenon ( e.g. the coupled double planar pendulums , the two - state quantum system , etc . ) can not be properly described by the simply kuramoto model . actually , the kuramoto oscillator is equal to the left - invariant flow on the simplest nontrivial lie group @xmath1 ( see the refs .",
    "@xcite for the fundamental knowledge of lie group ) . accordingly ,",
    "in this paper , by extending the concept of kuramoto oscillator to left - invariant flow on general lie group , we investigate the generalized phase synchronization on networks .",
    "in particular , the left - invariant flows corresponding to non - abelian lie groups are named non - abelian oscillators , which can be applied on some non - abelian dynamical systems like quantum systems .",
    "this paper is organized as follow : in section 2 , the concept of synchronization of non - abelian oscillators is introduced . in section 3 ,",
    "the analyses and simulations on some typical examples are given , including the @xmath0-dimensional torus @xmath2 , the identity component of 3-dimensional general linear group @xmath3 ( i.e. @xmath4 ) , the special unitary group @xmath5 and the special orthogonal group @xmath6 .",
    "finally , we sum up this paper and discuss the relevance of phase synchronization of non - abelian oscillators to the real world in section 4 .",
    "some mathematic remarks are given in the appendix .",
    "first of all , we review the simple oscillator : @xmath7 it is obvious that @xmath8 is the solution of the equation @xmath9 which relates to the dynamical system @xmath10 on the circle @xmath11 .    in terms of lie groups",
    ", @xmath12 is an abelian lie group with its lie algebra @xmath13 and the map @xmath14 is the exponential map of @xmath15 .",
    "the system ( 3 ) is also called the left - invariant flow , of which the tangent vector field is called left - invariant vector field on @xmath15 .",
    "this fact motivates the idea that the left - invariant flows on the general lie groups can be considered as _ general oscillators_. in particular ,",
    "the left - invariant flows on the non - abelian lie groups can be considered as _ non - abelian oscillators_. let @xmath16 be a lie group and @xmath17 its lie algebra .",
    "if @xmath18 , then the left - invariant flow determined by @xmath19 on the @xmath16 is @xmath20 different from those defined on the linear euclidean spaces , the above dynamical system ( 5 ) is defined on the manifold @xmath16 .",
    "next we consider the synchronization of network , of which each node is located a general oscillator on the lie group @xmath16 with its lie algebra @xmath17 .",
    "the collective synchronization behavior of the coupled general oscillators starts by randomly choosing an element @xmath21 in @xmath17 and an initial phase @xmath22 for each node @xmath23 . in the case of the general oscillator",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 correspond to the frequency @xmath26 and @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , respectively .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that , in general , the phase space of our general oscillator is both non - abelian group in algebra , and non - linear space , which is a manifold , in geometry .",

    "are the average over 100 independent runs corresponding to the case of @xmath31.,title=\"fig : \" ]    for a dynamical system on the manifold @xmath16 , its equations of motion should be written in a local coordinate system because , generally , there does not exist a global coordinate system on a manifold .",

    "note that , the multiplication functions are the local representation of the multiplication in the lie group , and the matrix valued function ( 8) is the map induced by multiplying by @xmath48 at left .",
    "this map translates every vector in the lie algebra to @xmath48 .",

    "then , by the theory of lie groups , this solution can be extended to an one - parameter subgroup , which corresponds to a left - invariant flow .",
    "in this section , we will show some analyses and simulations on several typical examples .",
    "all the simulations are obtained based on the watts - strogatz ( ws ) network @xcite , which can be constructed by starting with one - dimensional lattice and randomly moving one endpoint of each edge with probability @xmath30 .",

    "1 displays the relations between the phase order parameter and the coupling strength for various values of the rewiring probability @xmath30 , where @xmath31 .",
    "since the dynamical behaviors in different dimensions are independent , and each one is equal to a simply kuramoto oscillator , the synchronization behavior in each dimension is the same as that of a kuramoto oscillator @xcite . in a word ,",
    "the small - world effect ensures the global synchronization for sufficiently large coupling strength , and the higher disorder ( i.e. larger @xmath30 ) will enhance the network synchronizability .",
    "this example can be used to describe the collective behavior of the coupled double planar pendulums in a network .",
    "furthermore , according to the liouville - arnold theorem , the phase space of a integrable system , if it is compact , is a @xmath0-torus .",

    "it is worthwhile to emphasize that the order parameter of different systems can not compare to each other directly , since their definitions are not the same .",
    "@xmath91 , the special unitary group , is a connected compact lie group consisted of all anti - hermitian traceless matrices .",

    "it is worthwhile to emphasize that the behaviors of this dynamical system is independent to the local coordinate systems .",
    "it follows that the local coordinates ( 14 ) in @xmath5 can be replaced by @xmath101 which is convenient for the description of two - state quantum systems since the matrices @xmath102,@xmath103 , and @xmath104 are relative to pauli matrices as : @xmath105    note that , a one - parameter subgroup @xmath106 can be considered as the time - evolution in the quantum mechanics . since the subgroup @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is an arbitrary real number , represents the same time - evolution as @xmath109 does , we call two different nodes @xmath23 and @xmath85 are synchronous if they are only differ in a phase factor @xmath110 , that is @xmath111 therefore , if the equation @xmath112 is hold for every @xmath113 , the completely global synchronization is achieved .",
    "consequently , for each pair of nodes @xmath23 and @xmath85 , define the dynamical  distance \" between them as @xmath114 where @xmath115 signifies the modulus of the complex number .",

    "analogously , this system can approach to the global synchronized state for sufficiently large @xmath29 when @xmath30 is large enough .",
    "note that , @xmath117 for @xmath118 . thus in the uncoupling case ( i.e. @xmath119 ) , the order parameter @xmath90 approaches to 0.37 .    in terms of the hopf bundle @xmath120 ,",
    "the base space @xmath121 is the set of states of a two - state quantum system ( see the ref .",
    "@xcite and appendix b for details ) .",
    "therefore , let a two - state quantum system be located at each node of a small - world network , the whole system can achieve the synchronized state if the coupling strength is large enough . note that , the special orthogonal group @xmath6 has an isomorphic lie algebra to @xmath93 for the existence of the double covering @xmath122 , which is a homomorphism .",
    "therefore , the dynamical system @xmath6 has the same synchronized behavior as that of @xmath5 .",
    "the case where each node is located with a top can be represented by the system @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we extended the concept of kuramoto oscillator to the left - invariant flow on general lie group , and studied the generalized phase synchronization on small - world networks .",
    "the left - invariant flow on lie group can be used to represent many significant physical systems , such as the integrable systems ( e.g. the double planar pendulums ) , the two - state quantum systems ( e.g. ising model ) , the motions of top , and so on . in particular , the dynamics of two - state quantum systems on complex networks are extensively studied recently @xcite , the present work can provide us a theoretical frame to investigate their collective synchronized behaviors .    it is intuitive that the low - dimensional systems are more easily to synchronize .",
    "however , one may note that in the regular networks ( i.e. @xmath123 ) , the system @xmath124 does not exhibit synchronized behavior while the obvious synchronization is observed in the higher dimensional systems @xmath4 and @xmath5 when the coupling strength gets large .",

    "( 9 ) numerically .",
    "because of the using of local coordinate system , a question rises : does the eq . ( 9 ) express the behavior of the system in the whole manifold @xmath16 ?",
    "the answer is as follows .",
