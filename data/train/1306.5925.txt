    "recently the fcc - fe / ir(001 ) overlayer system has attracted both experimental and theoretical attention .",
    "thin overlayers were grown successfully with negligible fe - ir intermixing . a metastable unreconstructed monolayer ( ml ) of fe on the ir(001 )",
    "surface could be prepared @xcite and studied theoretically by ab initio methods @xcite .",
    "both theoretical investigations predicted a complex magnetic ground state .",
    "it should also be noted that complex chiral magnetic structures were also observed for a related bcc - fe / w(001 ) system @xcite .",
    "concerning adsorption , oxygen and hydrogen are the two most likely adsorbates to exist on fe / ir(001 ) surfaces .",
    "the investigation of their influence on the structural , electronic , and magnetic ground state is thus an interesting and relevant problem .",
    "we like to mention here a related recent experimental and theoretical study of an oxygen covered bcc fe(001 ) surface @xcite , where experiment confirms the formation of a well - defined monolayer where the oxygens occupy the four - fold coordinated hollow positions and stabilize the ferromagnetic ( fm ) state .",
    "the situation is richer and even more interesting in the present fcc fe / ir(001 ) case because oxygen adsorption can influence the fe - ir distance and thus also the magnetic ground state which sensitively depends on it @xcite .",
    "in contrast , hydrogen which is likely to be present due to the preparation of the fe / ir(001 ) samples @xcite , adsorbs and hybridizes differently from oxygen .",
    "the ground state structure including possible layer relaxations is determined by conventional ab initio tools ( the supercell vasp method@xcite , for more details see the next section ) .",
    "the magnetic ground state is predicted on the basis of the heisenberg model with exchange interaction parameters , determined from first - principles .",
    "two approaches are used : ( i ) in the first one , two effective pair interactions are obtained utilizing the total energies of the ferromagnetic ( fm ) and two antiferromagnetic ( afm ) configurations ( c(2@xmath02 ) and p(2@xmath01 ) ) for the respective relaxed structural models calculated by vasp ; and ( ii ) the disordered - local moment ( dlm ) state is used as a reference state for the extraction of exchange interactions as done in a previous paper @xcite for the clean fe / ir(001 ) system . the input electronic structure for the dlm state employs a realistic semi - infinite geometry and the tight - binding linear muffin - tin orbital ( tb - lmto ) method in the green function formulation .",
    "the dlm state is simulated in the alloy analogy approximation ( for more details see ref .   and references there ) .",
    "we used the geometry as obtained by the atomic force minimization of vasp and chose the radii of the atomic spheres in order to minimize their overlap .",
    "the above two approaches for the estimation of the exchange interactions are complementary to each other , the former one is more accurate , but since it employs only three magnetic configurations , its predictions are limited to the simplest magnetic structures and more complex configurations may thus be missed .",
    "we demonstrate this for a monolayer of fe on the ir(001 ) surface .",
    "the latter approach , based on the dlm method , does not assume any specific magnetic structure and takes into account a large number of exchange integrals ( which in two - dimensional case decay more slowly with distance than in the bulk case@xcite ) .",
    "the dlm approach using the tb - lmto method is , however , less accurate , in particular for the case of small interlayer adsorbate - iron distances .",
    "finally , stm images simulating the constant current measuring mode of stm were calculated using the tersoff - hamann approximation@xcite , where tip - sample interactions are neglected and thus the tip is supposed to follow contours of constant density of states contained in an energy interval given by @xmath1 and the applied bias voltage @xmath2 .",
    "first principles density functional theory calculations were performed using the vienna ab - initio simulation package vasp @xcite , using the projector augmented wave scheme @xcite and local density approximation ( lda ) as given by perdew - zunger ( ceperly - alder ) @xcite .",

    "three top layer distances have been relaxed , the remaining interlayer distances were fixed to the bulk experimental value for the ir crystal ( 1.92  ) .",

    "]    we see an overall good agreement between both approaches , nevertheless in the full dlm approach ( 90 shells ) the ground state moves from the antiferromagnetic c(2@xmath02 ) state ( the @xmath45-ordering vector ) to a more complex magnetic state with an ordering vector lying on the @xmath46 - @xmath45 line .",
    "we also note that both the p(2@xmath01 ) afm state ( the @xmath46-ordering vector ) and c(2@xmath02 ) afm state are energetically close while the ferromagnetic state ( the @xmath47 ordering vector ) is energetically higher ( due to the adopted convention for the heisenberg hamiltonian @xcite the lowest energy corresponds the maximum of the @xmath43(@xmath48 curve ) .",

    "the oxygen atoms occupy fourfold fe hollow sites . ]",
    "we see that 1ml oxygen induces a p(2@xmath01 ) antiferromagnetic state ( the @xmath46-ordering vector ) in contrast to the c(2@xmath02 ) antiferromagnetic state ( the @xmath45-ordering vector ) originally considered for the clean surface . the high stability of the p(2@xmath01 ) state is strongly reduced for a half - monolayer oxygen coverage .",
    "interestingly the ferromagnetic state is energetically rather close to the ground state , which can be ascribed to the interplay between fe - o hybridization which promotes p(2@xmath01 ) state and the increase of the fe - ir distance upon o adsorption .",
    "the ferromagnetic state is the ground state for large fe - ir interlayer distances in the fe / ir(001 ) system @xcite .",
    "the energetic ordering can be understood , at least qualitatively , by applying the kanamori - goodenough - anderson @xcite rules in a simple way .",
    "these rules predict that fe - o - fe bond angles of 90@xmath49 favor a ferromagnetic ( fm ) coupling of the fe atoms while fe - o - fe bond angles of 180@xmath49 favor an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) one .",
    "we apply now these rules for the 1  ml o overlayer as depicted in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_eno ] .",
    "the preferred magnetic coupling is a result of magnetic interactions between neighboring fe atoms ( fe - o - fe bond angles 85@xmath49 ) and next - neighboring fe atoms ( fe - o - fe bond angles 146@xmath49 ) .",
    "for the present purpose , the values of 85@xmath49 and 146@xmath49 for the calculated minimum energy geometry are sufficiently close to the ideal values of 90@xmath49 and 180@xmath49 . summing up neighboring and next - neighboring fe couplings",
    "one easily finds that for the most stable afm p(2@xmath01 ) state one half of the 85@xmath49 couplings are favorable while the other half is unfavorable , whereas both 146@xmath49 couplings are favorable . in case of the fm configuration",
    "the favorable 85@xmath49 couplings are offset by unfavorable 146@xmath49 fm couplings .",
    "for afm c(2@xmath02 ) all couplings are unfavorable , indicating a predominance of fe - o - fe induced couplings over the substrate related c(2@xmath02 ) afm coupling of the fe atoms , which is also offset by the increased fe / ir distance upon o adsorption . in summary",
    "one can safely state that oxygen adsorption on the fe / ir(001 ) surface strongly influences the magnetic ordering in the fe monolayer .",
    "turning now to the influence of hydrogen adsorbed at the preferred fe - bridge sites on the magnetic state , the results for the lattice fourier transform are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig_jqh ] .    , @xmath43(*q@xmath44 * ) , for the fe / ir(001 ) system covered by half a monolayer of hydrogen ( 0.5 ml h e 2 ) .",

    "the hydrogen - free clean antiferromagnetic c(2@xmath02 ) fe / ir(001 ) system ( 0 ml h e 2 ) is shown for comparison . ]    a weak preference for the antiferromagnetic p(2@xmath01 ) state ( @xmath46-ordering vector ) is seen , as expected from the total energy calculations but the antiferromagnetic c(2@xmath02 ) state ( @xmath45-ordering vector ) is energetically quite close .",
    "these results suggest , that the effect of h - adsorption on the magnetic state of fe / ir(001 ) is weaker as compared to the o - adsorption .",
    "this is also accompanied by a weaker influence on the geometrical structure .      in this subsection we present results for the magnetic stability of the oxygen monolayer as determined from the dlm model .",
    "we wish to point out that the tb - lmto - dlm model employs the spherical charge approximation which is less accurate as compared to the full potential methods like vasp .",
    "we have shown , however , that for layer relaxations up to 15% of the interlayer distance ( the case of fe / ir(001 ) @xcite ) the results obtained using the total energy and tb - lmto methods are in a good agreement ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_jqref ] and discussion there ) . however , the situation for an o - monolayer is , worse as the o - fe interatomic distance amounts to only 2.01    ( as compared to the host interatomic distance of 2.72   ) .",
    "the problem in our tb - lmto model consists in the division of the space into vacuum , oxygen , and iron spheres which is not unique .",
    "we have therefore used the same approach as in our previous work @xcite . a similar approach used recently for the oxygen adsorption on bcc - fe(001 ) has lead to a qualitative agreement with experiment . in fig .",

    "compared are two different tb - lmto based dlm approaches , one with just two exchange integrals ( lmto li 2 ) and the other with all 90 calculated exchange integrals ( lmto li 90 ) . ]    like in fig .",
    "[ fig_jqref ] , we tested the dependence of the magnetic stability on the number of shells included in calculations of the lattice fourier transform . the most important conclusion , namely , that the oxygen monolayer stabilizes the antiferromagnetic p(2@xmath01 ) ground state for fe / ir(001 ) ,",
    "was unambiguously obtained in both approaches .",
    "in addition , even quantitative agreement is satisfactory although the differences for various number of shells included in the dlm method are larger as compared to the oxygen free case ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_jqref ] ) . on the other hand , there is no indication for a more complex magnetic state if the number of included exchange interactions is increased .",
    "surprisingly , the simulated constant current stm images shown in fig .  [ fig_stm ] resolve the p(2@xmath01 ) afm magnetic ordering of the fe atoms even for a simulation assuming an unpolarized tip in the tersoff - hamann model .",

    "<S> simulated scanning tunneling images using the simple tersoff - hamann model hint that the proposed p(2@xmath01 ) antiferromagnetic order could be detected even by non - magnetic tips . </S>"
