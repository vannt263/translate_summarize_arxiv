    "although the localization of light inside pcs doped by microcavities is a global phenomenon due to the photonic band gap effect and the broken symmetry of the lattice , both resonant wavelengths and localized modes may be well approximated using a local representation of the electromagnetic field .",

    "the domain of validity of the  infinitely conducting cavity  model depends on the strength of the localization of the light with respect to the conicity angle .",
    "for example in our case , decreasing the conicity angle induced the shift of the localized modes toward the lower edge of the band gap .",
    "therefore the localized mode is delocalized out of the microcavity hence the model of  the infinitely conducting cavity  is no more valid .",
    "this behavior explains why equation ( [ reson ] ) must be applied for low inclinations of the wave vector with respect to the plane defined by the cross section of the fibers ( i.e. for @xmath97{0xb0}}% % beginexpansion { { } ^\\circ}% % endexpansion $ ] ) .",

    "$ ] demonstrates that the optical interactions of the pc and the cylinder sheath modify strongly the photonic band structures .",
