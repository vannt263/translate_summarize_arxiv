    "one  dimensional quantum wires provide an interesting opportunity to study mesoscopic physics in an interacting system . on the one hand , it is well established theoretically that interactions give rise to unique electronic properties in one dimension , described by the so called tomonaga ",
    "luttinger liquid ( tll ) model.@xcite a detailed comprehension of the remarkable interplay between interactions and disorder has been achieved.@xcite on the other hand , little attention has been paid to the role of the contacts which are known to influence strongly the transport properties of mesoscopic structures and quantum wires . in this respect ,",
    "two simplified models were proposed recently .",
    "either one connects a finite wire to the reservoirs by tunneling barriers,@xcite leading to the suppression of the ballistic conductance at low temperature due to the dramatic effect of the interactions .",
    "alternatively , in the opposite situation , the wire is perfectly connected to one ",
    "dimensional leads,@xcite yielding a perfect conductance independent on the interactions of any range less than the wire length.@xcite the latter result contradicts the conductance reduction by the interactions predicted in a wire without contacts,@xcite and is in agreement with recent experiments on micron  length quantum wires.@xcite the perfect conductance can be explained through an extension of landauer s approach to the interacting wire.@xcite the reservoirs are taken into account by the flux they inject which acts as an initial condition for the equation of motion of the density.@xcite the incident flux is perfectly transmitted for any range of interactions .",
    "but reservoirs inject electrons which are not the proper modes of the wire .",
    "this leads us to introduce intermediate noninteracting leads so that we can properly identify the injected and transmitted electronic flux . under theses circumstances an incident electron undergoes multiple internal reflections at the contacts due to change in interactions , leading to a perfect transmission into a series of spatially separated charges.@xcite    while the ballistic conductance of a quantum wire can not reveal the tll character of the wire , the natural question one asks is if the other spectacular manifestations of the tll model , that are the signature of its non  fermi  liquid behavior , can be still observed .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to study these features .",
    "some have already been addressed in the literature,@xcite but new interesting effects of the leads will be seen to appear .",
    "we will also discuss recent experiments on quantum wires.@xcite    beyond these points , in the present paper we develop a formal framework to deal with the properties of any inhomogeneous tomonaga  luttinger liquid ( it ll ) .",
    "an it ll can occur in circumstances more general than contact effects .",
    "for example , a spatially varying effective interaction can be due to a varying width of the wire or to a nearby gate with a peculiar geometry .",
    "one can also think of another ideal system , the edge states in the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe).@xcite the it ll model might be relevant to describe transitions between edges at different filling , or an edge state connected to a fermi liquid.@xcite this motivates us to investigate not only electrons with spin but also spinless electrons with external interacting leads .",
    "let us now summarize our main results .",
    "a typical feature of a tll is the separation of the charge and spin dynamics .",
    "imagine that one injects a spin polarized flux of electrons into one external lead , and detects transmitted spin and charge on the second external lead .",
    "since the latter is noninteracting , one might suspect that charge and spin recombine .",
    "but we show that this is not the case : the charge and spin parts are separated even in the noninteracting leads .",
    "such process has been first studied in refs . for spinless electrons .",
    "the propagation is defined in terms of a quasiparticle current ( corresponding to laughlin quasiparticle in the fqhe ) , and to a superposition of electron - hole excitations in a quantum wire .",
    "the basic buildingblock in the description of this effect is the scattering matrix of one quasiparticle at the contact between a tll of parameter @xmath12 and a second one of parameter @xmath13.@xcite the reflection coefficient is @xmath14 , thus is negative when @xmath15 .",
    "such exotic result indicates an analogy with andreev@xcite reflection even for repulsive interactions .    in connection with this andreev reflection",
    ", we are here led to show a second aspect , the manifestation of proximity effects.@xcite it is known that a typical feature of the tll is the nonuniversal algebraic decay of correlations of different types , reinforcing the tendency towards a cdw or superconducting order which can not be of long range due to the importance of quantum fluctuations in one dimension .",
    "it is important to know the effect of the finite size and of the leads on the fluctuations .",
    "we will show here that the dominant tendency in the wire extends towards the external leads .",
    "a new aspect of the `` mutual proximity effect '' manifests itself when the wire has a tendency towards a wigner crystal ( @xmath16 cdw ) .",
    "this happens usually for coulomb interactions@xcite but also for very repulsive short range interactions . for electrons with spin with charge interaction parameter @xmath3 ,",
    "the wigner crystal dominates the @xmath1 cdw at any temperature in an infinite wire , while the inverse holds at @xmath7 . with external leads connected to a wire with parameter @xmath3",
    ", we show the existence of a crossover temperature depending on position @xmath17 below which the @xmath1 cdw dominates the wigner crystal .",
    "@xmath17 has a non  trivial powerlaw dependence on both the distance to the contacts and the wire length .",
    "the behavior of density correlations can be probed through coupling to a backscattering potential .",
    "the effect of weak impurities on the conductance of the wire with leads was found to be qualitatively similar to that without leads,@xcite and this seems in agreement with experiments.@xcite but compared to the usual tll , the conductance is affected in a nontrivial way by the contacts , especially when isolated barriers are considered.@xcite we show here that for electrons with spin this dependence becomes more crucial for very repulsive interactions because , as mentioned above , the external leads obscure the tendency towards the formation of a wigner crystal at low temperature .",
    "apart from the specific model we consider , we improve the study of weak impurities .",
    "usually , the renormalization equations in the presence of one barrier@xcite are derived for both the thermal length , @xmath18 , and the wire length , @xmath19 , infinite : their finite values are accounted for semi  empirically by introducing @xmath20 as a cutoff . here , the renormalization equations are explicitly derived for finite lengths @xmath19 and @xmath21 . besides",
    ", they are extended to a backscattering potential whose total spatial extension is less than @xmath21 and @xmath19 .",
    "another important question concerns the fluctuations of the conductance in the presence of a random potential distribution .",
    "this question can arise in experiments even if the mean free path is much larger than the wire length due to the imperfection and roughness on the boundaries . here",
    "we show that the conductance is self - averaging at high temperature , more precisely @xmath8 is of the order @xmath22.@xcite but this ratio saturates at @xmath10 at temperatures low compared to @xmath23 .",
    "this has to be taken seriously into account when one tries to infer precise powerlaws from the experimental value of @xmath24 .",
    "let us now give the plan of our paper which does not follow the above sequence of results .",
    "instead , we separate the paper in two parts : the first deals with spinless electrons which are also relevant for the fqhe , while we restore spin in the second part . for spinless electrons ,",
    "we begin by describing the formalism and the inhomogeneous luttinger liquid model .",
    "we discuss the discontinuous interaction case which is suitable to understand qualitatively the results ; it might be relevant for edge states in fqhe , but is has to be taken with some caution for quantum wires .",
    "we then study the density ",
    "density correlation functions for two reasons .",
    "first , in order to show how the dominant tendency in the wire extends towards the external leads , in analogy with proximity effects .",
    "next , to investigate the role of backscattering . in particular",
    ", the nonlocal correlation functions at finite temperature and at low frequencies are computed .",
    "any extended non ",
    "random weak potential is then considered , for which the leading renormalization equation is derived explicitly at finite temperature .",
    "the conductance is expressed perturbatively in the backscattering potential .",
    "we discuss the random  impurity case where the most important new result concerns the conductance fluctuations .",
    "in the second part dealing with electrons with spin , most of the spinless treatment can be extended except for two important points .",
    "first , the transmission process is studied explicitly .",
    "secondly , we show in which way leads affect the tendency towards the wigner crystal that exists for very repulsive short range interactions .",
    "this induces different regimes for the correction to the conductance in the presence of a backscattering potential .",
    "finally , we discuss the experimental results obtained in quantum wires .",
    "in a strictly one  dimensional system with short range interactions between spinless electrons the low  energy properties can be fully parameterized by two parameters @xmath25 and @xmath4 . without interactions @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the hamiltonian can then be expressed as @xmath28,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is related to the long - wavelength component of the electron density through @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the canonical momentum conjugate to @xmath29 , @xmath32=i\\pi\\delta(x - y)$ ] . taking into account the discreteness of the electrons , haldane derived the representation of the total electron density in terms of @xmath29:@xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath35 obey @xmath36 .",
    "for the noninteracting case only @xmath37 and @xmath38 are nonzero , however in the presence of interactions higher coefficients appear .",
    "the @xmath35 then can be calculated perturbatively , as done implicitly in ref ..    consider now an interacting wire delimited by @xmath39 $ ] whose length will be denoted by @xmath40 connected perfectly to non  interacting leads .",
    "the global system is described by the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) with spatially varying parameters @xmath41 , and @xmath42.@xcite we require @xmath25 and @xmath4 to be uniform on the external leads , i.e. for @xmath43 , taking values @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "even though the most relevant situation of noninteracting leads corresponds to @xmath26 and @xmath46 , it is interesting to keep @xmath45 for other possible applications , for instance the fqhe.@xcite    we note that the absence of translational invariance in the quantum wire gives rise to an inhomogeneous chemical potential @xmath47 that can be incorporated by a translation in @xmath29.@xcite then one has to replace , in eq.([representation ] ) , @xmath48    let us discuss the microscopic arguments for the it ll model .",
    "if one assumes that the screening does not take place in the same way in the two  dimensional gas into which the wire opens and inside the wire we can argue that interactions are described by a function @xmath49 which is not translationally invariant .",
    "but then the electronic momentum is not conserved anymore in the vicinity of the contacts .",
    "indeed , this appears when one bosonizes the interaction hamiltonian @xmath50 , using @xmath51 from eq.([representation ] ) : the exponential terms in @xmath29 can not be ignored in general , and those terms violate momentum conservation .",
    "but if @xmath52 where @xmath53 varies slowly on scales @xmath54 , one can reduce the hamiltonian to a quadratic form.@xcite strictly speaking , this condition is required to find a perfect conductance , as discussed in ref ..",
    "if this condition is not met , and for not too strong interactions , the perfect conductance is recovered in the high temperature limit , but is reduced due to the abrupt change in interactions at low temperature .",
    "for instance , when @xmath55 and @xmath56 are constants for @xmath57 , exponential terms in @xmath58 can not be ignored , and give rise to effective barriers determined by the jump of the interactions . nevertheless , due to the symmetry of the structure , and since one needs @xmath59 to be able to use the tll model , one can easily achieve resonances that suppress the role of these terms .    for quantum wires opening adiabatically into a two  dimensional gas ,",
    "the situation of abrupt variations is not realistic ; it is adopted for mathematical convenience , and the results can be be trusted only far from the contacts compared to @xmath54 where the behavior should not depend on the profile of variations at the contacts .",
    "we shall however look at the behavior at the contact because it is very similar to that in the strong tunneling limit of two coupled luttinger liquids:@xcite the effective parameter at the contact , yielding the local conductance @xcite and controlling the correlation functions@xcite is exactly the same as the parameter for the equivalent tll liquid in ref ..    the situation for edge states in the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) might be different .",
    "quadratic terms arise from tunneling between edge states , which is more difficult to achieve due to their spatial separation .",
    "recently , the model with discontinuous parameters was shown to be suited to describe transitions between edges with different filling,@xcite or the connection between an edge state and a fermi liquid.@xcite in any case , most of the results we derive here can be extended to any profile of variations of the parameters .",
    "it is well known that symmetry breaking phase transitions can not occur in one dimension .",
    "but the interactions in an infinite wire enhance charge density or superconducting fluctuations depending on whether they are repulsive or attractive .",
    "the natural question is to know whether such tendencies persist in the presence of leads .",
    "in the present subsection , we would like to compute the correlation functions not only to answer this question , but also to explain the proximity effect,@xcite and to give the necessary tools for studying the role of backscattering in the next section , closely related to the tendency towards formation of a charge density wave .",
    "let us write the density  density correlation function , using eq.([representation ] ) : @xmath60}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is given in terms of the fundamental bosonic green function@xcite @xmath62 as @xmath63 @xmath64 is a cutoff different but in general of the order of @xmath65 .",
    "we impose on the imaginary time @xmath66 , so that @xmath67 can be computed at finite temperature , without dependence on @xmath64.@xcitethe consequence of this cutoff procedure on analytic continuation is elucidated in appendix [ correlation ] .    in eq.([rhorho ] ) @xmath68 is given by eq.([phi0 ] ) , and @xmath69 note that the first term ( in @xmath61 ) in eq.([rhorho ] ) can be obtained from the limit @xmath70 of @xmath71",
    ".    instead of writing out explicitly @xmath71 the imaginary part of its fourier transform in the low frequency limit @xmath72 will be of more use : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a dimensionless function .",
    "the function @xmath75 can be obtained from @xmath76 by multiplying @xmath42 by @xmath77 , thus we will often study @xmath76 , denoted @xmath78 for simplicity .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath61 being due to the nonlocal part @xmath79 in eq.([utau ] ) , we can write ( for details see appendix [ correlation ] ) @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 is a dimensionless time integral , eq.([gint ] )",
    ". we can find the properties of @xmath83 for general smooth variations of @xmath4 and @xmath25 , and we have computed it explicitly for any @xmath84 in the discontinuous interaction case and at finite temperature . by deforming the contour of integration in the complex plane , the computation is made much easier , especially in the low temperature limit . in the high temperature limit ,",
    "more steps are needed .",
    "the results are given explicitly in appendix [ correlation ] .",
    "in an infinite wire with uniform parameter @xmath4 , @xmath85 is a function of @xmath86 , and we denote it by @xmath87 .",
    "it decreases exponentially at separations larger than @xmath88 , @xmath89 , while its local value has the typical powerlaw in temperature @xmath90 that diverges in the zero temperature limit when @xmath91 , indicating an enhancement of the density fluctuations compared to the noninteracting case .    for interaction parameters",
    "@xmath92 constant in the bulk of the wire and reaching their asymptotic values @xmath93 on the external leads , four general properties of @xmath78 can be shown .",
    "the first and second one hold at high temperature , where comparison can be made with @xmath94 .    1 .   at @xmath95",
    ", we have @xmath96 where @xmath87 is the value of @xmath78 in an infinite wire with parameter @xmath4 .",
    "thus we recover the translationally invariant behavior for any @xmath84 far from the contacts compared to @xmath21 .",
    "2 .   again , at @xmath95 , but for any location of @xmath84 , we have @xmath97 for @xmath98 , while the inverse inequality holds for @xmath99 .",
    "3 .   at any temperature , and for small separations compared to @xmath21 , @xmath78 factorizes : @xmath100 this is due to the fact that @xmath101 [ eq.([chic ] ) ] , up to corrections of order @xmath102 .",
    "the local value of @xmath78 is almost constant on segments much less than the wire length and the thermal length .",
    "if we denote @xmath103 then @xmath104 these equalities hold up to corrections of the order of @xmath105 .",
    "let us now specialize to the case of discontinuous parameters .",
    "first we introduce the quasiparticle density @xmath106 for @xmath107 which are the right and left  going proper modes in a uniform tll .",
    "they correspond to laughlin quasiparticle currents in edge states of the fqhe .",
    "as we said before , the basic quantity for understanding the physics is the scattering matrix@xcite of quasiparticles at the contact of two perfectly connected tll with parameters @xmath4 and @xmath45 .",
    "it acts in the space @xmath108 and is given by @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the reflection coefficient @xmath111 the matrix @xmath112 relates the outgoing flux to the injected flux , defined not in term of wavefunction amplitudes as in usual scattering approaches , but directly in terms of the quasiparticle current @xmath113 .",
    "the local effective parameter ( yielding a local kubo conductance@xcite ) is given by @xmath12 multiplied by the transmission coefficient,@xcite @xmath114    let us first discuss the high temperature limit .",
    "it is worth noting that a lower ( upper ) bound to @xmath85 , completing eq.([majoration ] ) , is given by @xmath115 for @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) . in eq.([chic ] ) , the nonlocal part @xmath83 is given by eq.([cf1 ] ) in the limit @xmath95 , while it simplifies to a constant [ eq.([clow ] ) ] in the limit @xmath118 , in accordance with property ( [ decouple ] ) .",
    "the green function @xmath67 is given by eq.([apgz ] ) .",
    "instead of writing explicitly the factor @xmath119 that enters in eq.([chic ] ) , we use the local value of @xmath78 .",
    "this is equivalent as far as the dominant behavior is concerned because @xmath120 is a slowly varying function of @xmath121 ( cf .",
    "appendix [ correlation ] ) .",
    "thus we drop it from @xmath122 in the high temperature limit @xmath123 ) , the multiple reflections caused by the change in interactions do nt affect the correlation functions due to the lack of thermal coherence along the wire .",
    "only one reflection is felt within a thermal length @xmath124 from the contacts .",
    "we now define @xmath125 the time it takes for a quasiparticle emanating at @xmath121 to reach the closest contact , measured in units of @xmath64 . for @xmath126 [ eq.([tx ] ) ] , we find @xmath127 again , for points far from the contacts compared to @xmath21 , this expression coincides with that obtained in an infinite tll with parameter @xmath4 , @xmath128 .",
    "at the contacts , we find @xmath129 [ cf eq.([chia ] ) ] ( this amounts to setting @xmath130 in eq.([vrenorm ] ) , using @xmath131 ) .    in the limit of temperatures low compared to @xmath132 , the multiple reflections affect the correlation functions , thus the external leads with parameter @xmath45 determine the temperature dependence .",
    "but there is a nontrivial dependence on the wire length as well as on the distance of the barrier from the contacts : @xmath133 this gives the behavior for @xmath126 .",
    "@xmath134 can be obtained by setting @xmath130 in this expression .",
    "remember that one obtains @xmath135 from @xmath136 ( in both temperature limits ) by multiplying both @xmath4 and @xmath45 by @xmath77 , which leaves @xmath110 [ eq.([gamma ] ) ] unchanged . clearly , the @xmath137 cdw is less important than the @xmath1 one .",
    "further , if electrons in the external leads are non interacting , @xmath46 , the @xmath137 cdw are suppressed in the zero - temperature limit because @xmath138 [ eq.([integration ] ) ] .",
    "let us first recall an exotic phenomena emanating from this model , the analogy with andreev reflection.@xcite    [ [ andreev - reflection ] ] andreev reflection + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the reflection coefficient of a quasiparticle from a tll with parameter @xmath12 incident on another one with parameter @xmath13 is given by @xmath110 , eq.([gamma ] ) , and is _ negative _ for @xmath15 , i.e. a partial quasi - hole is reflected back .",
    "this is similar to andreev reflection of an incident electron on a normal  superconductor interface .",
    "the similarity is the closest for @xmath139 and @xmath140 , because the wire has a tendency towards superconductivity , but it holds more generally even for repulsive interactions , for instance for a quasiparticle in the wire with @xmath91 incident on the noninteracting lead .",
    "it is worth noting that in the case of two semi ",
    "infinite wires with @xmath12 and @xmath13 as parameters , and @xmath15 , the local kubo conductance at the interface is given by the transmission coefficient from @xmath141 to @xmath142 multiplied by @xmath12 , i.e. by @xmath143 .",
    "this verifies @xmath144.@xcite this is very similar to the inequalities for an n - s interface , if one interprets @xmath12 as the conductance ( kubo ) of the normal side , @xmath145.@xcite    finally , let us comment on a recent paper@xcite based on the model in ref . of two tlls connected by a tunneling term .",
    "the bosonized theory was associated with conformal field theories to describe quasiparticles in term of soliton states .",
    "interestingly , in the strong tunneling limit , the scattering matrix for these states at the interface turns out to be the same as eq.([scattering ] ) .",
    "this gives a stronger foundation of the quasiparticle scattering scheme we introduced previously.@xcite    [ [ proximity - effect-1 ] ] proximity effect + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the reflection at the contact gives rise to a proximity effect for both superconducting or cdw correlations.@xcite this can be seen computing the correlation functions on the external leads .",
    "in particular ,",
    "when @xmath95 , there is no coherence between the endpoints of the wire , and it is sufficient to consider half the system .",
    "the wire and one lead have a symmetric role ; it is sufficient to permute @xmath4 and @xmath45 in eq.([vrenorm ] ) in order to find @xmath78 for @xmath146 , and to take @xmath147 . by the way ,",
    "this situation is relevant for the fqhe , if two edge states with different filling are connected.@xcite    at @xmath148 , instead of eq.([integration ] ) inside the wire , outside the wire one has @xmath149 up to @xmath150 . beyond a distance of the order of @xmath19 in one external lead ,",
    "we recover the simple law @xmath151 .    for clarity",
    ", we discuss the consequence for noninteracting leads , @xmath46 .",
    "then if @xmath91 , the density  density correlations in the bulk are similar to those in an infinite wire , but are reduced when one goes to the contacts because @xmath152 decreases for @xmath153 .",
    "besides , this enhancement extends in the external leads up to a distance @xmath154 [ eq.([lmin])].@xcite for @xmath155 , the pairing correlation function , which can be obtained from @xmath78 if one replaces @xmath4 by @xmath156 and @xmath45 by @xmath157 , is enhanced up to a distance @xmath158 .",
    "this increases with @xmath4 , i.e. where interactions are more attractive .",
    "this is reminiscent of the proximity effect.@xcite    in general , we can show that the proximity effect extends up to the minimum length scale at hand .",
    "we must note that this holds even for a smooth profile of @xmath25 and @xmath4 , as for instance the properties of @xmath78 exposed before are general .",
    "we study now the role of impurities in the wire .",
    "the conductance with impurities was shown to depend on the interactions and is generally affected by the external leads.@xcite the main goal of this part is to give a general scheme to treat the effect of a weak backscattering potential @xmath159 in a non  translational invariant system and at finite temperature .",
    "the coupling of the conduction electrons to impurities with potential @xmath159 is @xmath160 , where @xmath51 is given by eq.([representation ] ) .",
    "it is then convenient to do an integration by parts giving @xcite @xmath161 the forward scattering term @xmath162 is absorbed by a translation of @xmath29 by @xmath163 which has to be included in the scalar function @xmath68 , eq.([phi0 ] ) .",
    "note that the impurity hamiltonian ( [ nouvelle ] ) is similar to that considered usually if we replace our @xmath164 by @xmath165 .",

    "this is not the coulomb interaction but an infinite series of logarithmic terms related to the transmission process discussed earlier ( see eq.([apgz])).@xcite the renormalization procedure is implemented by increasing the cutoff to @xmath175 , where @xmath64 is the bare cutoff @xmath176 , and modifying the parameters in order to keep @xmath167 invariant .",

    "this gives the leading - order flow equations for @xmath159 _ explicitly at finite temperature _",
    "@xmath183 note that in the limit of zero temperature , an infinite uniform wire with parameter @xmath4 , and a purely local @xmath166 , the fourier transform of this equation yields the well - known flow equation for @xmath184 , @xmath185,@xcite provided @xmath186 is independent on the cutoff as we required .",
    "in general , one expects @xmath159 to renormalize the interactions . in the extreme case of a local barrier ,",
    "it was shown by integrating out degrees of freedom away from the barrier that the interactions are not renormalized.@xcite we can both recover and generalize this result in a different way , by using the expansion above at finite temperature and in the finite wire : new interaction terms @xmath187 between the charges are generated by the renormalization , but they decay faster than @xmath188 at long time scales . for instance , in the zero - temperature limit , and for a barrier in the center of the wire , @xmath189 is corrected by @xmath190 , where @xmath191 is renormalized by @xmath166 . at finite temperature , we have @xmath192 , i.e. @xmath187 is still decaying faster than @xmath61.@xcite    let us now discuss a more extended potential than one barrier , but whose total extension obeys @xmath193 [ eq.([lmin ] ) ] .",
    "it turns out that when one goes to a cutoff such that @xmath194 , the partition function ( [ zprem ] ) becomes identical to that of a local barrier.@xcite this is related to the property ( [ chiloc ] ) .",
    "then it is tempting to assume that the effect of such a potential would be similar to that of a local barrier at length scales larger than the potential extension @xmath195 .",
    "but one has to check that the renormalization from the bare cutoff up to @xmath195 does not modify the local interaction parameter , i.e. @xmath42 at points where @xmath196 .",
    "this would induce non translational invariant effective interactions even if the bare @xmath4 is uniform .",
    "we can for instance show that @xmath68 [ eq.([phi0 ] ) ] is renormalized by a complicated complex function , whose equation is rather lengthy to write .",

    "using the boson green function properties on the external leads ( restricting ourselves to the case @xmath310 with spin ) , the temperature dependence of the correlation function corresponding to the @xmath137 cdw at @xmath148 has a term @xmath435 .",

    "we however find a more complex dependence of @xmath222 on the temperature and the location of the barriers .",
    "for instance , if the backscattering is merely due to the contacts , the exponent @xmath441 would correspond to the local parameter @xmath442 , thus to @xmath443 .",
    "of course we do nt expect the same combination of parameters to appear in the case of smooth variations of @xmath4 , but this serves as an illustration ; as we discussed in section [ secgeneral ] , the effective parameter that controls the powerlaw increases when one gets closer to the wire .",
    "probably the potential configuration depends on each wire , and more precise fit and evaluation of @xmath444 are required .",
    "even more caution is needed if the potential is random . while the conductance is self  averaging at high temperature ( eq.([ratiohight ] ) ) , its fluctuations become more important at low temperature , of the order of the reduction @xmath222 , eq.([ratiolow ] ) ; then one has not to measure simply the absolute value of @xmath222 , but also its fluctuations .    on the other hand , yacoby _",

    "@xmath67 depends on the temperature and the wire length , but is reproducible for different wires made in wells of the same width .",
    "this indicates that the reduction in the conductance is not due to potential fluctuations , but rather to the backscattering of electrons from the two  dimensional gas when entering the wire . in the high temperature limit , the one - channel wire conductance is @xmath235 , ( @xmath447 ) in accordance with theoretical results .",
    "but @xmath67 decreases when one lowers temperature , or increases the wire length , in a way similar qualitatively to the law @xmath448 or @xmath449 for an interacting wire with parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the main objection of yacoby _ et al .",
    "_ against this tll interpretation is that temperature is scaled by the fermi energy which varies with electron density , in contradiction with the observed plateaus which are density independent .",

    "the importance of these two effects is however not so obvious to assess .",
    "first , energy scales different from the fermi energy might play the role of the cutoff .",
    "second the way @xmath4 depends on the density ( i.e. the gate voltage ) is difficult to estimate : a fully microscopic calculation of @xmath4 would be necessary , including the capacitive effects of the gates .",
    "we have however also to remark that our model is not the best suited to describe the complicated geometry of the experiments .",

    "are enhanced in the bulk of the wire , and decrease , while staying enhanced compared to the noninteracting case , when one goes beyond the contacts .",
