    "even though pion - nucleon scattering has been extensively studied for many years , there still remains a number of interesting problems to be explored , especially with the construction of powerful new facilities such as tjnaf ( thomas jefferson national lab ) in virginia , usa . in this brief paper",
    "we analyze pion nucleon scattering up to 700 mev laboratory kinetic energy of pion using a simple , covariant and unitary model of @xmath6 scattering@xcite .    in this work",
    ", the @xmath6 scattering amplitude is obtained as a solution of a relativistic wave equation in which the pion and eta is restricted to their mass shell in all intermediate states . the rationale for this approach has been discussed by gross and surya@xcite .",
    "the kernel of the relativistic integral equation includes undressed delta ( @xmath7roper@xmath8 and @xmath2 poles in addition to the undressed nucleon @xmath9 pole .",
    "the kernel also includes contributions derived from crossed @xmath10and @xmath2 diagrams , as well as from @xmath11- and @xmath12-like exchange terms . to keep the model simple the crossed terms",
    "are approximated by contact interactions as described in reference [ 1 ] .",
    "the @xmath13 coupling is taken to be the superposition of both pseudoscalar and pseudovector coupling and the @xmath14 coupling is taken as a superposition of both scalar and vector coupling .",
    "however for simplicity we take only scalar coupling for the @xmath15 coupling ( the results obtained also show this tendency ) .",
    "the feynman rule for the @xmath13 and @xmath16vertex are given as follows ,    @xmath17    @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 is the pion momentum , @xmath21 is a mixing parameter that is determined by the requirement that the nucleon mass be unshifted by the interaction @xcite , @xmath22 @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the coupling constants adjusted to fit data and @xmath25 is the nucleon mass .",
    "the @xmath13 coupling @xmath26 is chosen to be equal to 13.5 the same as in the reference [ 1 ] .",
    "the model has been described in detail in reference [ 1 ] except for the @xmath27 resonance .",
    "figure ( 1 ) shows additional kernels that one needed to describe the @xmath2 resonance .",
    "consistent with the previous model , the crossed diagram is approximated as a contact interaction .",
    "figure ( 2 ) shows the self energy of @xmath28 @xmath29 is the infinite sum of iterated the contact diagrams .",
    "the @xmath30and@xmath31 are treated as a coupled channel .",
    "due to the contact interactions approximation , the model allows us to fit the spin @xmath32and spin @xmath33 phase shifts separately .",
    "our fit to @xmath34 and @xmath35 phase shifts are given in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "the fit is good .",
    "the @xmath2 phase shifts are particularly interesting .",
    "figure 5 shows how the total is built up from individual contributions , the curves in the figures show the result when the kernel @xmath36 includes only the direct nucleon pole term and the contact term derived from crossed nucleon exchange @xmath37 the combined @xmath11- and @xmath12- like contact terms ( the dot line ) , @xmath38 the terms in ( @xmath39 ) @xmath37 the additional @xmath12-like @xmath40 contact term ( the dot - dashed line ) , @xmath41 the terms in ( @xmath42 ) plus roper driving terms ( dashed line ) and finally @xmath43 the total result , which includes the terms in ( @xmath44 ) plus @xmath2 driving terms ( solid line ) .    from our calculation",
    "the contribution from @xmath2 ( including @xmath45channel ) plays an important role to pion nucleon interaction at energies above 600 mev as shown in figure 5 .",
    "table 1 shows parameters that are used to fit the data  ( column 2 ) .",
    "the table includes effective masses @xmath46 and widths@xmath47 of the resonances ( column 3 ) . in the table , @xmath48represents the baryon cut off mass , @xmath49 is the inelastic coupling in the roper channel .",
    "we found the @xmath2 width is smaller compared to particle data group ( @xmath50100 to 250 mev)@xcite .",
    "this maybe is related to our smaller value of g@xmath51as compared to effective models results @xcite or qcd sum rules using interpolating field results @xcitewhich is around 2 .",

    "we have successfully extended the relativistic , simple and unitary model of pion nucleon scattering @xciteto analyze the pion nucleon scattering up to 700 mev which includes the @xmath2 resonance .",
    "we find that the model works well despite of our meson on - shell approximation in all intermediate states .",
    "we also find that the inclusion of @xmath68 channel tends to give the correct high energy behavior .",
    "the coupling of pion and eta to the nucleon and @xmath2 is smaller than expected .",
