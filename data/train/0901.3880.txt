    "in a pioneering work of @xcite , gupta and kumar have studied the sum - rate scaling of wireless ad hoc networks as the number @xmath1 of randomly located source - destination ( s - d ) pairs increases in a fixed area .",
    "they showed that the sum - rate scales as @xmath6 using a nearest multihop transmission . the hierarchical cooperation scheme was recently proposed in @xcite improving the sum - rate scaling drastically . specifically , the sum - rate scales almost linearly in @xmath1 that is well matched with the information - theoretic upper bound .",
    "then a natural question is how the sum - rate scales if the number of sources and the number of destinations are not balanced . as extreme cases",
    ", we can consider a single source sending messages to the rest of the nodes or a single destination collecting messages from the rest of the nodes in the network .",
    "the work in @xcite has considered the single - destination network and proved that the capacity scales as @xmath7 , which is also true for the single - source network .",
    "notice that this result indicates that adding more nodes in the network only provides a marginal gain , that is , the per - node rate tends to zero .",
    "one of the promising approaches to resolve the unbalanced network topology is to adopt multiple antennas at the source ( or at the destination ) .",
    "the works in @xcite show that having multiple antennas increases the capacity of a point - to - point link proportionally to the minimum number of transmit and receive antennas when the channel state information ( csi ) is available at the receiver .",
    "this result can be directly extended to the single - destination network in which the destination has @xmath0 antennas and @xmath1 sources have a single antenna each .",
    "thus , the sum - rate increases proportionally to @xmath0 if @xmath8 . for the single - source network ,",
    "achieving linear scaling becomes much more challenging because the source should acquire csi in order to apply the transmit beamforming techniques such as the dirty paper coding with optimal beamforming @xcite or zero - forcing beamforming @xcite . from a practical point of view , it is hard to obtain csi at the transmitter ( csit ) due to the time - varying channels and feedback overhead , especially for a large wireless network with many antennas at the source .    in this paper , we study the capacity scaling of the single - source network having multiple antennas at the source when csi is available only at the receiver side .",
    "we mainly focus on the feasibility of the linear increase of the sum - rate proportional to the number of source antennas by using receiver cooperation only .",
    "thus , we address the questions regarding the minimum number of required nodes in the network to achieve this linear scaling and the type of receiver cooperation that can achieve the optimal scaling law . to answer these questions",
    ", we first derive an information - theoretic upper bound and propose a cooperative multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) scheme achieving the same scaling as the upper bound .",
    "in this section , we define the underlying network and channel models and explain the performance metric used in the paper .",
    "the matrix and vector operations used in the paper are summarized in table [ table : simbols ] .",
    "we consider a single - source wireless network .",
    "there exists a single source having @xmath0 antennas at the center of the network and @xmath1 destinations each having a single antenna are uniformly distributed over a unit square area .",
    "the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath11 denote the position of the source and @xmath12 denote the position of the @xmath13-th destination , where @xmath14 .",
    "we consider a far - field channel model .",

    "now consider the channel from the @xmath13-th to the @xmath20-th destinations at time @xmath16 that is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the phase at time @xmath16 from the @xmath13-th to the @xmath20-th destinations .",
    "we assume fast fading in which @xmath19 and @xmath23 are uniformly distributed within @xmath24 independent for different @xmath13 , @xmath20 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath16 .",
    "we further assume that csi is available only at the receivers .",
    "the received signal of the @xmath20-th destination at time @xmath16 is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the @xmath29 transmit signal vector of the source , @xmath30 is the transmit signal of the @xmath13-th destination , and @xmath31 is the noise of the @xmath13-th destination that is independent for different @xmath13 and @xmath16 .",
    "note that not all destinations transmit simultaneously at a given time and some @xmath30 s in ( [ eq : input_output ] ) may be zero .",
    "the source and each destination have power constraints @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "thus @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath14 . for notational convenience",
    ", we will omit time index @xmath16 in the rest of the paper .      throughout the paper",
    ", we will analyze the capacity scaling of the single - source wireless network , which could be a function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we define the individual rate @xmath36 such that for suffuciently large @xmath0 the source can transmit with at least @xmath36 bps / hz to each of @xmath1 destinations with high probability ( whp ) .",
    "then the achievable sum - rate is simply given by @xmath37 .",
    "for notational simplicity , ` whp ' used in the paper means that an event occurs with high probability as @xmath38 , @xmath1 also tends to infinity as @xmath38 . ] .",
    "in this section , we obtain an upper bound on the sum - rate , which will be compared to the achievable sum - rate derived in the next section .",

    "the sum - rate is upper bounded by mimo capacity .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the @xmath44 normalized input covariance matrix given by @xmath45 .    [ thm : rate_upper ] suppose the single - source wireless network . for sufficiently large @xmath0 , @xmath46 scales as @xmath47 whp .    for @xmath48 , from ( [ eq :",

    "thus the upper bound scales as @xmath2 whp .    for @xmath61",
    ", we obtain @xmath62 where we use generalized hadamard s inequality for the first inequality and set @xmath63 for the second inequality .",
    "thus @xmath64 whp that scales as @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , theorem [ thm : rate_upper ] holds .",
    "in this section , we propose a cooperative mimo scheme and analyze its achievable rate . we define a small region around the source , and serve the destinations in that region using a small fraction of time . notice that it is possible to set the area of the region and time fraction such that it does not affect the overall rate scaling while making the distance between the source and the destinations outside the region as @xmath66 .",
    "thus the proposed scheme is about the transmission to the destinations outside the region . for simplicity , we assume all destinations are located outside the region in the rest of the paper . as mentioned before , due to the lack of csi , the source can not perform a coherent beamforming .",
    "instead , we apply the cooperative mimo to induce the cooperation among the destinations .",
