    "magnetic fields can greatly influence stellar winds by guiding the outflowing plasma along field lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the extent of this influence depends largely on the magnetic field strength and the wind mass loss rate .",
    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) simulations of axisymmetric hot - star winds with no rotation show that the competition between the wind and the field can be quite well characterized by a single wind magnetic confinement parameter , @xmath3 , as defined by @xcite , and described further in  [ sec : alfven ] below .    for significant confinement ( i.e. , @xmath4 ) , material driven from opposite footpoints of closed magnetic loops is forced to collide near the loop tops , leading to a _ magnetically confined wind shock _ ( mcws ) scenario for production of intermediate - hardness x - rays @xcite . for the magnetic hot star @xmath5  ori  c , which is inferred to have both a moderately strong wind ( with mass loss rate @xmath6@xmath7/@xmath8 ) and a large - scale , dipole field of strength @xmath9 @xcite , recent mhd simulations based on this mcws paradigm provide quite good agreement with the x - ray spectrum observed by _",
    "indeed , because @xmath5  ori  c  is a relatively slow rotator ( with period @xmath10  15  days ) , even the observed rotational modulation can be well accounted for by simply varying the observational perspective within a _ non - rotating _ dynamical simulation model .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to report on initial mhd simulation results for more rapidly rotating hot stars , in which the rotation can have a direct dynamical effect on the overall evolution of the wind outflow and its confinement .",
    "the results have particular relevance in the context of two proposed models for rotating , magnetic hot stars , known generally as the _ magnetically torqued disk _ ( mtd ) model @xcite and the _ rigidly rotating magnetosphere _ ( rrm ) model @xcite . the mtd has been proposed as a scenario for producing _ keplerian _ decretion disks , such as inferred from the balmer line emission of classical be stars .",
    "the rrm leads instead to _ rigid - body _ disks or clouds that provide a promising way to explain the rotationally modulated balmer emission from strongly magnetic ap / bp stars like the b2pv star @xmath2  ori  e  @xcite .    after first casting the relative importance of magnetic confinement vs.  rotation in terms of characteristic alfvn vs.  kepler corotation radii (  [ sec : alfven ] ) , we show in  [ sec : keplerian ] that even for parameters fine - tuned to optimize the chances of a producing a keplerian disk , our 2d mhd simulations for rotationally aligned , dipole fields instead produce a combination of inflow and outflow for material below and above the kepler corotation radius , and never lead to the kind of extended keplerian disk envisioned in the mtd scenario .",
    "on the other hand , we show in  [ sec : breakout ] that a model with strong magnetic confinement ( @xmath11 ) does lead to a _ rigid - body _ disk , much as predicted in the rrm model .",
    "however , the outer regions of this disk are characterized by episodic breakout of material , driven by the strong net outward centrifugal force associated with the spin - up of material into corotation with the underlying star . moreover",
    ", the energy release associated with magnetic reconnection in these breakout events heats material to extremely high temperatures , providing a promising mechanism for explaining the very hard x - ray flare emission recently observed from magnetic bp stars such as @xmath2  ori  e. we conclude in  [ sec : summary ] with a brief summary of our findings , noting also the need for further work on the detailed physics of this somewhat - novel , centrifugally driven reconnection mechanism .",
    "mhd simulations @xcite indicate that the effectiveness of magnetic fields in channeling a stellar wind outflow can be characterized by the ratio between the magnetic and wind energy densities @xmath12 this ratio furnishes an indication of whether the magnetic field at radius @xmath13 dominates the wind outflow ( @xmath14 ) , or vice versa ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "as indicated by the second equality , its overall scaling is set by the `` magnetic confinement parameter '' @xmath16 , which depends on the strength of the field @xmath17  at the stellar surface radius @xmath18 , and on the wind terminal momentum @xmath19 .",
    "the radial variation of @xmath20 is then modeled in terms of a magnetic power - law index @xmath21 ( @xmath22 for a dipole ) and a velocity index @xmath23 ( @xmath24 for a standard cak wind ) .",
    "if for simplicity we ignore the wind velocity variation ( i.e. by taking @xmath25 ) , the alfvn radius  at which the magnetic and wind energy densities are equal , @xmath26  can be solved explicitly as @xmath27 as shown by simulation results summarized in @xcite , this alfvn radius provides a reasonable estimate for the maximum radius of magnetic loops that remain closed in a wind outflow . moreover , since in rotating models such closed loops tend to keep the outflow in rigid - body rotation with the underlying star , it also defines the radius of maximum rotational spin - up of the wind azimuthal velocity @xmath28 .    to characterize such rotational effects ,",
    "let us next define a kepler corotation radius @xmath29 .",
    "analogous to the terrestrial geostationary orbital radius , @xmath29  is the point at which the centrifugal force arising due to corotation balances the local gravitational force from the star .",
    "that is , @xmath30 where @xmath31  is the equatorial rotation velocity of the star . solving this equation",
    ", we find the kepler radius as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is ratio of the star s equatorial velocity to the critical velocity @xmath34 .",
    "finally , it is also worth noting here that corotation out to an only slightly higher escape radius , @xmath35 would imply an azimuthal velocity @xmath28  that equals the local escape speed from the star s gravitational field .",
    "the above scalings suggest that a likely necessary condition for propelling outflowing material into a keplerian disk ( as envisioned in the mtd scenario for classical be stars ) is to choose a combination of parameters for magnetic confinement vs.  stellar rotation such that @xmath36 . in the parameter plane of @xmath37 vs.  @xmath38 illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : domains ] , the required combination is represented by the relatively narrow gray band .    to obtain a model that has the best chance of yielding a keplerian disk , we therefore conduct 2d axisymmetric mhd simulations of a star having parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 that fall in the middle of the gray area in fig .  [",
    "fig : domains ] .",
    "the initial magnetic field geometry is assumed to be a dipole aligned with the rotation axis .",
    "calculations are undertaken using the publicly available zeus-3d code @xcite , augmented to include radiative driving and radiative cooling @xcite , with typical early b - star values for the stellar radius and mass , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the numerical grid and boundary conditions follow those given in @xcite .",
    "since the star is rotating at one half its critical value , the oblateness and gravity darkening of the stellar surface are relatively small , and are neglected in our simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig : fallback ] illustrates results from the simulation .",
    "the left - hand panel shows the logarithm of density ( superimposed with field lines ) at a time 90@xmath43  after the introduction of the dipole field into a spherically symmetric wind .",
    "superficially , these conditions do temporarily resemble the mtd scenario .",
    "however , a closer inspection shows that most of the density - enhanced equatorial region does not have the appropriate @xmath28  necessary for a stable , stationary , keplerian orbit .",
    "indeed , in just a few @xmath43  of subsequent evolution this putative  disk \" becomes completely disrupted , characterized generally by infall of the material in the inner region , i.e. below the kepler radius @xmath29 , and by outflow in the outer region above the kepler radius .",
    "the right - hand panel demonstrates this by showing the irregular form of the dense compression at an arbitrarily chosen later time ( 390@xmath43 ) .",
    "the bold arrows emphasize the flow divergence of the dense material both downward and upward from the kepler radius .",
    "( the overall evolution is most vividly illustrated through animations available on the internet . )",
    "we have carried out a number of other similar mhd simulations exploring parameter space in both the rotation rate and magnetic field strength directions . in every case , we find that the equatorial compressions are dominated by similar radial inflows and/or outflows , with no stable keplerian disks forming . we thus conclude that stationary , large - scale magnetic fields are dynamically ill - suited for producing keplerian or near - keplerian decretion disks .",
    "a recent study by @xcite suggests that , in the limit of very strong magnetic confinement ( @xmath44 ) , magnetic torquing can readily produce _ rigid - body _ disks . in this strong - field limit",
    ", the field lines can be idealized as rigid pipes that channel the wind outflow and force it to corotate with the underlying star .",
    "this leads to a rigidly rotating magnetosphere in which material accumulates near minima of the effective gravito - centrifugal potential along each field line .",
    "@xcite show that the resulting circumstellar clouds provide a natural explanation for the observed rotational modulation of both the photometric continuum and balmer line emission in the b2pv star @xmath2  ori  e.",
    "a key feature of this rrm model is that the magnetic field not only torques up outflowing material into corotation around the star , but then also _ holds it down _ against the net outward centrifugal acceleration beyond the kepler radius . in the semi - analytic rrm analysis ,",
    "the field is idealized as being strong enough to enforce corotation and confinement at arbitrarily large radii , and for arbitrarily long times .",
    "more realistically , however , for large but finite field strengths , the secular accumulation of material into the rrm means that these idealizations must break down once the total outward centrifugal force exceeds a level that can be balanced by the finite magnetic tension .",
    "@xcite speculate that this will lead to centrifugal breakout of material , and give estimates for the expected characteristic breakout timescale as a function of distance above the kepler radius ( see their appendices a and b ) .",
    "for the case of @xmath2  ori  e , they estimate that the largest - scale evacuations can be expected every @xmath45 , but they also anticipate a whole hierarchy of breakout events extending down to timescales of days .",
    "our present mhd simulations allow us to examine the dynamics of this breakout process .",
    "unfortunately , at the confinement parameter @xmath46 appropriate to @xmath2  ori  e , the alfvn speed becomes very large , implying a very small courant time step to ensure numerical stability ; this together with the full 3d geometry needed to model the oblique - field tilt relative to the rotation axis makes direct mhd simulation of the @xmath2  ori  e  case prohibitively expensive .",
    "instead , we consider the more tractable , 2d axisymmetric case of a field - aligned dipole with only moderately strong magnetic confinement ( @xmath47 ) . as appropriate for @xmath2  ori  e",
    ", we again set the rotation to half the critical rate ( @xmath40 ) , with other stellar and grid parameters also the same as used in ",
    "[ sec : keplerian ] .",
    "snapshots from the simulations , plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : breakout ] , reveal that there forms a rigidly rotating disk near and above the kepler radius @xmath48 , as predicted by the rrm model . but in the outer regions of this disk ( near the alfvn radius @xmath49 ) , there is indeed also a semi - regular sequence of breakout events . during a breakout ,",
    "the magnetic field lines become so drawn out by the ejected plasma that they reconnect , snapping back toward the star ( cf .",
    "middle and right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : breakout ] ) . the energy release associated with this reconnection , and its subsequent dissipation via radiative cooling , represents a strong candidate for producing the hard x - ray flares observed in @xmath2  ori  e  by _ rosat _ @xcite and _ xmm - newton _ @xcite .",
    "this scenario is reminiscent of fast magnetic reconnection processes invoked for solar flares ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "but in the present case , the work to stretch the magnetic fields comes from the rotational energy of the dense plasma at the edge of the disk , with the trigger for reconnection being the wind impingent at an oblique angle from higher latitudes . the centrifugal energy stored temporarily in the magnetic field is thereby converted into thermal energy , heating nearby material to temperatures @xmath50 , high enough to produce the hard ( @xmath51 ) components of the x - ray flares observed in @xmath2  ori  e. a similar mechanism may also be relevant to x - ray outbursts recently observed in other ( possibly magnetic ) early - type stars , such as the mid - b star hd  38563s @xcite and the late - o star @xmath52  ori  a  @xcite .",
    "the centrifugal breakout here provides an interesting counterexample to the `` slingshot prominence '' model of @xcite .",
    "this cool - star , coronal model envisions a tearing - mode instability @xcite in the current sheet dividing open field regions in an overlying , gas - pressure - driven wind .",
    "this leads to a magnetic reconnection that effectively _ traps _ some of the outflowing wind material , contributing then to an extended , quasi - static coronal prominence @xcite .",
    "although the centrifugal support of this prominence is similar to our rrm scenario for hot - stars , in this cool - star case the high coronal back - pressure chokes off any footpoint upflow that could continuously feed the accumulation region above the kepler radius . in our hot - star model ,",
    "it is this secular accumulation of material that eventually forces centrifugal breakout and drives the associated reconnection . as such ,",
    "unlike the tearing - mode reconnection postulated in this cool - star context , we believe the overall rate of reconnection and mass ejection should be relatively independent of the specific instabilities and plasma processes at play .    in real plasmas ,",
    "the details for magnetic reconnection can be quite complex , involving non - thermal particle acceleration @xcite and/or high - speed jets that form dissipative shocks @xcite , with the distribution of heat modified by thermal conduction or non - local particle transport @xcite .",
    "the zeus-3d numerical code used here is based on ideal an mhd formalism that effectively ignores these complexities , and indeed does not even include any explicit resistivity that could heat material via ohmic dissipation . instead , magnetic reconnection is enabled by the finite spatial grid resolution , leading to grid - scale currents inducing high - speed jets that quickly dissipate the flow energy in localized shock fronts .",
    "nonetheless , the reconnection rates observed in our models are consistent with kinetic simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , and the code still approximately fulfills global energy conservation , thus providing a first description of the net dissipation of magnetic energy into plasma heating .",
    "hence , we believe the simulations presented here represent a physically reasonable scenario for heating by centrifugally driven reconnection , with the associated x - ray emission providing a promising explanation for the x - ray flares observed from magnetic ap / bp stars .",
    "the rigid - body corotation makes the equatorial disks in our simulations quite distinct from the keplerian disk envisioned in the mtd scenario promoted by @xcite .",
    "we find no evidence of an extended region of keplerian rotation .",
    "instead the results correspond more closely to those derived in the rrm analysis of @xcite , although the confinement parameter we consider is near the lower end of the range of validity for the basic rigid - field approach .",
    "moreover , our numerical simulations further suggest a novel mechanism for magnetic reconnection , driven by episodic centrifugal breakout events . the strong reconnection heating associated with such breakout represents a promising mechanism for explaining x - ray flares observed in magnetic bp stars such as @xmath2  ori  e.    in future work",
    ", we plan to use more - extensive numerical tools to investigate in greater detail the reconnection processes within this centrifugally driven breakout scenario .",
    "we also plan to explore hybrid methods that could allow extensions of mhd simulations to larger confinement parameters , including 3d models of tilted - field cases more appropriate to @xmath2  ori  e  and other magnetic hot - stars ."
