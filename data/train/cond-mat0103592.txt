    "interaction between polyelectrolytes and ionic amphiphiles has attracted significant attention in both the molecular biology and the condensed matter physics communities  @xcite .",
    "the driving motivation for this surge in interest is the possible application of polyelectrolyte - amphiphile complexation in gene therapy  @xcite .",
    "one of the major stumbling blocks in designing a successful gene therapy is the lack of a transfection mechanism by which a dna strand can be inserted into a cell  @xcite .",
    "the problem arises as a result of strong electrostatic repulsion between the dna and the molecular membrane , both of which are negatively charged .",
    "this repulsion prevents a dna segment from coming in contact with a cell membrane , thus precluding any possibility of transfection . to overcome the electrostatic repulsion a number of protocols have been developed .",
    "the most explored ones rely on genetically modified viral vectors .",
    "a number of complications which can arise from the viral gene therapy have stimulated a development of non - viral methods  @xcite .",
    "one such method explores the association between a negatively charged dna and cationic lipids or surfactants . a particular method which has attracted much attention relies on formation of lipoplexes  @xcite .",
    "these are complexes composed of a dna strand and cationic lipid vesicles .",
    "unfortunately the non - viral methods are also prone to problems since , as is well known , the cationic surfactants and lipids are toxic to an organism  @xcite .",
    "an interesting question which then arises is what is the minimum concentration of cationic amphiphile needed to form a lipoplex or a surfoplex ?",
    "this question is well posed , since it has been known for some time that the polyelectrolyte - ionic amphiphile complexation occurs in a cooperative manner  @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , possible to identify the location of the cooperative condensation with the critical concentration needed to form complexes .",
    "what is the internal structure of such complexes ?",
    "are the condensed amphiphiles uniformly distributed along the dna or do they form micellar aggregates on the surface of a polyion ? as a first attempt to study this difficult problem we shall appeal to a very simple model  @xcite .",
    "we consider a rigid polyion modeled as a cylinder of length @xmath0 and radius @xmath1 inside a uniform medium of dielectric constant @xmath2 . the total charge of a polyion , @xmath3 , is uniformly distributed along the length of the cylinder so that each one of the @xmath4 monomers has charge @xmath5 . to further simplify the calculations ,",
    "the longitudinal and angular degrees of freedom are discretized .",
    "the surface of the cylinder is subdivided into @xmath4 parallel rings of @xmath6 sites each .",
    "the @xmath7 condensed amphiphiles are restricted to move between the @xmath8 ring sites , on the surface of the cylinder .",
    "each amphiphile has a charged head group and a hydrocarbon tail . for generality we shall take the head group to have charge @xmath9 .",
    "the hardcore repulsion between the amphiphiles requires that each site is occupied by at most one amphiphile . for the specific case of dna and dodecyltrimethyl amonium bromide ( dotab ) at the cooperative binding transition @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "we define the occupation variables @xmath11 , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 , in such a way that @xmath14 if a surfactant is attached at @xmath15th ring position of the @xmath16th monomer and @xmath17 otherwise . since the number of amphiphiles is fixed , the values of occupation variables obey the constraint @xmath18    the hamiltonian for this model has the following contributions :    * electrostatic surfactant - monomers interaction : @xmath19    where we have introduced a dimensionless charge density , the manning parameter  @xcite , @xmath20    * electrostatic surfactant - surfactant interaction : @xmath21 + * hydrophobic interactions between the hydrocarbon tails : @xmath22    where @xmath23 . the first term of eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) is due to the interactions between nearest neighbor amphiphiles on the same ring , while the second term is due the interactions between equivalent sites on consecutive rings .",
    "the hydrophobicity parameter @xmath24 can be related to the size of the amphiphiles alkyl chain  @xcite .",
    "the hydrophobic interactions between surfactant and water produce an effective attraction between the amphiphiles , forcing them to stick together . by doing",
    "so they expel the water molecules from their vicinity , lowering the overall free energy .",
    "the pairwise additive form of the hydrophobic interaction adopted in eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) is clearly an over simplification .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that this simple expression will help shed some light on the structure of the polyion - amphiphile complexes .",
    "to begin our study of the distribution of surfactants along the polyion we shall appeal to the mean field theory  @xcite . a note of caution , however , must be raised . while the mean field theory is expected to work very well for coulombic long ranged interactions",
    ", it might not be so successful with the short ranged hydrophobic forces .",
    "this is in particular so since the problem is intrinsically one dimensional , and the fluctuations associated with the short ranged hydrophobic interactions are expected to be significant  @xcite . with this note of caution in mind",
    "we shall proceed with the mean field study .",
    "the gibbs - bogoliubov inequality puts an upper bound on the total free energy , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the free energy associated with the trial hamiltonian @xmath27 . to perform the calculations we shall take @xmath27 to be of a particularly simple one body form , @xmath28 the partition function associated with @xmath27",
    "can be calculated straight forwardly @xmath29 and the free energy is @xmath30 the average occupation of site @xmath31 on the ring @xmath16 , @xmath32 , is then @xmath33 or @xmath34 the free energy associated with @xmath27 can be rewritten as @xmath35    after evaluating the average of @xmath36 with respect to @xmath27 , the upper bound to the total free energy becomes @xmath37    to find the optimum upper bound , eq .",
    "( [ free ] ) must be minimized with respect to the average site occupation , leading to @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a lagrange multiplier introduced to enforce the constraint @xmath40 and @xmath41 \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the constraint above , @xmath39 can be evaluated leading to a self consistent equation for the average site occupation , @xmath42 eq .  ( [ rho ] ) can be solved numerically to find the equilibrium amphiphile distribution along the polyion . in fig .",
    "[ fig : profilecomp ] we show the average number amphiphiles per ring along the polyion for @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we note that the amphiphiles are uniformly distributed along the polyion except at the ends of the macromolecule , where their density is strongly depleted .    for @xmath45",
    "a curious phenomenon occurs , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : peaks ] . at this value of hydrophobicity",
    "the sites of the central ring become preferentially occupied by the amphiphiles .",
    "this corresponds to a micellization transition , in which the strong hydrophobic attraction between the surfactants overcomes entropy to produce a mesoscopic aggregate of amphiphiles . as @xmath24 increases , a number of other peaks appear . within the mean field theory",
    "we find that the micellization transition is of first order .",
    "the fact that a short ranged interaction produces a first order transition in a pseudo one dimensional system should leave us concerned . to check the existence of this transition we have carried out a set of monte - carlo simulations ( mc ) .",
    "to simulate this model we use a standard monte carlo with particle - hole exchange , not restricted to nearest - neighbors pairs . the density profiles and",
    "the energy were measured after thermalization , results being both time and sample averaged .",
    "the simulations considered where done for dna with @xmath43 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and various values of @xmath24 .",
    "the averages were obtained using 100 samples .    for @xmath49",
    "we find that the mean field theory is in excellent agreement with the mc .",
    "for @xmath50 , on the other hand , the simulations do not find any evidence of the micellization transition present in mean field ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : profilesmc ] ) .",
    "the energy is a smooth function of @xmath24 , with no indication of the first order micellization transition , fig .",
    "[ fig : energymc ] .",
    "as expected , the short ranged hydrophobic interaction can not result in a phase transition in a one dimensional system .    in spite of the absence of a true phase transition",
    ", the correlations between the condensed amphiphiles can lead to formation of structures along the polyion . to study these ,",
    "we have constructed a histogram of amphiphile cluster sizes within the monte carlo simulation . here",
    "the size of a cluster is defined by the number of amphiphiles per ring .",
    "[ fig : histo ] shows that for amphiphiles with short alkyl tails ( small hydrophobicity ) the clusters are composed of only one amphiphile , with larger aggregates being highly improbable . with the increase in @xmath24",
    "we find , however , that this is no longer the case and a significant fraction of amphiphiles belongs to the maximum sized cluster of @xmath6 amphiphiles .",
    "although this is not a thermodynamic transition , the change in behavior evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : histo ] can be associated with the micellization .",
    "we have studied a simple model of micellization in the presence of polyelectrolyte .",
    "it is found that the mean field theory predicts a first order micellization transition for the ionic amphiphiles condensed on a polyion .",
    "this thermodynamic transition is an artifact of the mean field approximation and is the result of neglect of fluctuations associated with the short ranged hydrophobic interactions .",
    "monte carlo simulations show that the mean field works very well for small hydrophobicities , but fails completely for strong short ranged interactions .",
    "indeed the simulations do not find any evidence of a phase transition .",
    "nevertheless , if the hydrophobic interaction are sufficiently strong they will lead to significant correlations between the condensed amphiphiles , which can be interpreted as a micellar formation along the polyion chain ."
