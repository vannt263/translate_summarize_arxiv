    "a central uncertainty in the modeling of high energy radiation from blazar jets is the identity of the primary energy loss mechanism which controls the energy balance of the non - thermal plasma believed to produce the observed radiation ( e.g. , sikora et al .",
    "because of ambiguities in observer orientation relative to the jet axis and differing doppler beaming patterns for the various radiation processes , direct measurement and simple modeling of the high energy spectral components can not provide conclusive results . in this paper",
    ", we describe spectral signatures which may appear in the time - averaged synchrotron and synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) spectra of these objects .",
    "if they are present , then they provide strong evidence for the dominance of energy losses due to synchrotron self - compton emission rather than other processes such as external compton scattering or synchrotron emission .",
    "we consider the cooling of non - thermal electrons in a blob of plasma which has bulk lorentz factor @xmath1 . following the blazar model of bttcher , mause , & schlickeiser ( 1997 ) ,",
    "we assume that this blob starts off at a height @xmath2 above the accretion disk , and travels outward along the jet axis .",
    "the non - thermal electrons and/or positrons which produce the observed synchrotron and inverse compton emission are assumed to be injected at @xmath2 with an energy distribution @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the lorentz factor of an individual particle , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the maximum and minimum values at the time of injection , and @xmath7 is related to the total particle density @xmath8 by @xmath9 .    for synchrotron cooling and inverse compton cooling in the thomson limit",
    ", the single particle energy loss rate is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the electron mass , @xmath13 is the thomson cross - section , @xmath14 is the magnetic field energy density , and @xmath15 is the ambient photon energy density in the blob frame .",
    "if @xmath16 is constant , then for @xmath17 , the energy of an individual particle in the co - moving frame of the blob evolves as @xmath18 and the particle distribution as a function of time is @xmath19 for injection indices @xmath20 , the _ shape _ of the particle spectrum remains roughly constant , becoming somewhat softer with time at the highest particle energies for @xmath21 and somewhat harder for @xmath22 .",
    "the maximum and minimum lorentz factors , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , evolve according to eq .  [ gamma(t ) ] , so that the entire particle spectrum marches downward in energy as time passes .    to estimate the time - averaged synchrotron spectrum ,",
    "we integrate the @xmath25-function approximation of dermer & schlickeiser ( 1993 ; hereafter ds93 ) for the instantaneous synchrotron spectral emissivity : @xmath26 , \\label{jsyn(t)}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 g .",

    "[ jsyn_approx ] arises because of the near constant shape of the particle distribution for @xmath33 . combining eqs .",
    "[ jsyn_approx ] and [ tmax ] , we recover the standard result for synchrotron emission from a partially cooled particle distribution : @xmath34 this result agrees with the treatment of dermer , sturner , & schlickeiser ( 1997 ; their eq .",

    "both the present derivation of eq .",
    "[ jsyn_constant_beta ] and that of dermer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) formally rely on @xmath16 being constant .",
    "it will still apply if @xmath16 changes on time scales much longer than the typical energy loss time scale . for conical expansion of the jet outflow , magnetic flux freezing implies @xmath35 , where the index @xmath25 is of order unity .",
    "if synchrotron emission is the primary loss mechanism , then eq .  [ jsyn_constant_beta ] will hold if @xmath36 ( cf .",
    "ds93 ) . since limits on x - ray emission due to bulk",
    "comptonization imply injection heights of @xmath37 where @xmath38 cm for a @xmath39m@xmath40 black hole ( sikora et al .",
    "1997 ) , we can assume the magnetic field to be effectively constant .",
    "energy losses due to first order synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission can be estimated by using the synchrotron photon energy density : @xmath41 here @xmath42 is the mean residence time for photons produced in a spherical blob of radius @xmath43 .",
    "assuming @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , the single particle energy loss rate is @xmath47 and the maximum particle energy evolves according to @xmath48 where @xmath49 . in analogy to eqs .",

    "[ gdot2_ssc ] .",
    "notably , the @xmath53-dependence drops out of the time - averaged spectrum for the highest energy synchrotron photons .",
    "the time - averaged ssc spectrum can be estimated in a similar fashion .",
    "for this purpose , we use a similar @xmath25-function approximation for the ssc emissivity ( ds93 ) : @xmath54 \\frac{dn}{d\\gamma}\\left[{{\\left(\\frac{{{\\epsilon}}}{{{\\tilde{\\epsilon}}}}\\right)}}^{1/2}\\right ] .",

    "however , the maximum photon energy is instead related to the maximum electron lorentz factor by @xmath57 where the former value holds for early times , but only very briefly for typical blazar parameters ( see fig .  [ example_seds ] ) . modifying eq .  [ tmax_ssc ] accordingly",
    ", this implies for the high energy portion of the time - averaged ssc spectrum @xmath58 even though the instantaneous synchrotron and ssc spectra have similar spectral indices , the time - averaged index of the ssc emission will be harder than that of the synchrotron emission for @xmath46 .",
    "as a corollary to this , if synchrotron emission is the most important cooling process , the time - averaged ssc spectrum goes as @xmath59 ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ jsyn_constant_beta ] ) .",
    "the preceding discussion assumes that the shape of the particle distribution retains the same power - law index @xmath53 as it evolves .",
    "since the energy loss rates for all the electrons ( except the highest energy ones ) still have a @xmath60-dependence ( eq .  [ gdot_ssc ] ) , this will continue to be approximately true for injection indices @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , if ssc losses dominate the particle cooling , the synchrotron emission above the break energy @xmath62 will have a time - averaged spectral shape of @xmath63 and will be relatively insensitive to the shape of the injected particle distribution . as we noted above , for @xmath21",
    "the particle distribution becomes softer with time , while for @xmath22 it becomes harder .",
    "thus we would expect to see a distribution of spectral indices in the optical / uv clustered around @xmath64 as the injection index varies . in the thomson limit for ssc losses , eq .",
    "[ jsyn_final ] is a surprisingly good approximation over a broad range of injection indices . in fig .",
    "[ example_seds ] , we plot the time - averaged @xmath65 synchrotron and ssc spectra for injection indices @xmath663.5 .",
    "these spectra have been computed by numerically integrating the full expression for particle energy loss rates including synchrotron and ssc processes . here",
    "we have used the formulae of crusius & schlickeiser ( 1986 , 1988 ) to compute the instantaneous synchrotron spectra since they give more accurate results than eq .",
    "[ jsyn(t ) ] . for @xmath67 , which is at the limit of validity for eq .",
    "[ gdot_ssc ] , the time - averaged synchrotron spectral index is @xmath68 . even for @xmath69",
    ", we find @xmath70 .",
    "if one takes the klein - nishina roll - over into account , then the ssc energy loss rate will deviate from the thomson - limit expression for the highest energy electrons ( bttcher et al .",
    "this causes a flattening of the time - averaged synchrotron spectrum at the highest photon energies .",
    "the thick curve in fig .  [ example_seds ] is the time - averaged synchrotron spectrum for a @xmath71 calculation which uses the full klein - nishina cross - section in determining the ssc loss energy rates .",
    "another important implication of this analysis is that the spectral breaks associated with incomplete particle cooling can be significantly different from the generally assumed @xmath72 .",
    "even for synchrotron - dominated cooling , the ssc spectral break is @xmath73 .",
    "if ssc cooling dominates , then a range of spectral breaks can occur .",
    "their values will be related to the particle injection indices , and consequently , to the spectral indices of the lower energy emission . for synchrotron emission ,",
    "the spectral break is @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the index of the low energy ( uncooled ) part of the spectrum , while for ssc emission , @xmath76 .",
    "however , because of the short energy loss time scales associated with ssc cooling for typical blazar parameters and light travel time effects through the plasma blob , detection of these spectral breaks may be difficult ( chiaberge & ghisellini 1999 ; see also   4 ) .",
    "we note that the spectral breaks we discuss here are distinct from those which arise from energy cut - offs in the electron distribution function .",
    "dermer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found that such breaks will be seen if they are due to a low energy cut - off in the electron distribution or if the observation times are sufficiently short for high energy cut - offs .",
    "for example , the lowest energy breaks in both the synchrortron and ssc components shown in fig .",
    "[ example_seds ] reflect our choice of @xmath77 .",
    "as we have shown , even if the injected electron distribution varies by a significant amount , dominant ssc cooling will produce synchrotron emission with spectral index values close to @xmath64 .",
    "this is precisely what has been observed for the @xmath78-ray blazar 3c  279 .",
    "hartman et al .  ( 2001 ) have used the model of bttcher et al.(1997 ) and bttcher & bloom ( 2000 ) to fit the infrared through @xmath78-ray spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of 3c  279 for several epochs during which simultaneous multiwavelength data were taken .",
    "the bttcher et al .",
    "model calculates , in detail , the spectra and energy losses due to synchrotron , ssc , and inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of accretion disk radiation both directly from the disk and rescattered in the putative broad line region ( blr ) .",
    "the sed fits of 3c  279 , which describe the optical / uv spectra fairly well , yield spectral indices for the synchrotron emission in these wavebands of @xmath791.7 for injection indices of @xmath803.1 .",
    "if synchrotron cooling were the most important process , then we should find a different range of indices , @xmath811.55 .",
    "although the optical / uv spectral shape for 3c  279 indicates that ssc emission is the principal cooling mechanism , this does not require that the observed emission in the gamma - ray band will be dominated by ssc flux . during the period in which 3c  279 was seen to have its",
    "largest observed @xmath78-ray flare ( 1996 jan 30feb 6 , epoch p5b of hartman et al .",
    "2001 ) , the observed @xmath78-ray flux was found , using the bttcher et al .",
    "model , to be consistent with being mostly composed of disk and blr ic emission , not ssc emission .",
    "however , the greater relative strength of the disk and blr ic components is due to the fact that the assumed observer angle @xmath82 lies well within the doppler beaming angle of @xmath83 for their calculations . as dermer ( 1995 ) pointed out , external compton scattered emission has a substantially narrower beaming pattern than ssc emission , and therefore it will have a relative magnitude greater by at least a doppler factor ( @xmath84 in this case ) as compared to ssc emission for the same total luminosity .",
    "for the calculations performed for epoch p5b , the ssc component dominates the disk and blr ic components for observing angles @xmath85 .",
    "consistent with this , the energy loss rates calculated by the bttcher et al .",
    "code do show that ssc emission is the principal cooling mechanism .",
    "application of this model to multiwavelength observations of the @xmath78-ray blazar pks  0528 + 134 had much less success in reproducing the optical spectral shape ( mukherjee et al .",
    "the observed optical emission was significantly harder than that of 3c  279 while the model parameters used to fit the pks  0528 + 134 seds were consistent with cooling predominantly by ssc emission .",
    "this suggests that some other cooling mechanism controls the particle evolution , or as was proposed by mukherjee et al .",
    ", that some additional processes , such as particle re - acceleration downstream in the bulk outflow , are occurring .",
    "bl lac objects may provide a better `` laboratory '' in which to test the importance of ssc cooling than the flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) as they generally do not show accretion disk components or strong broad emission lines , and the high energy emission can often be accounted for solely by ssc emission .",
    "since the synchrotron and ssc components have the same doppler beaming patterns , comparing the observed luminosities of these two components will indicate whether synchrotron or ssc cooling is more important .",
    "ironically , bl lacertae itself does occasionally exhibit weak broad uv emission lines , and madejski et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and bttcher & bloom ( 2000 ) have shown that a blr ic component seems to be required to explain the @xmath78-ray emission . as with pks  0528 + 134 , its optical spectrum is not well modeled by synchrotron emission from an ssc - cooled particle distribution .",
    "this spectral diagnostic for ssc cooling need not be restricted to the optical / uv bands . for high frequency bl lac objects ( hbls ) , the synchrotron component peaks in the uv rather than in the infrared as it does for low frequency bl lac objects ( lbls ) such as bl lacertae ( ghisellini et al .",
    "1998 ) . in hbls",
    ", the @xmath86 signature of ssc cooling will appear in the x - ray range rather than in the optical / uv . during the 1994 may x - ray / tev flare of the hbl mrk 421",
    ", the x - ray energy spectral index was seen to evolve from @xmath87 during the rise of the flare to a maximum value of @xmath88 as the flux diminished ( takahashi et al .",
    "this spectral evolution was attributed to synchrotron cooling , but the extremal value of @xmath88 suggests that ssc cooling may be the primary mechanism .",
    "nearly simultaneous @xmath78-ray fluxes measured at 100mev through tev energies seem to indicate that the ssc luminosity was indeed greater than the synchrotron luminosity during this flare episode ( macomb et al .",
    "by contrast , the hbl mrk 501 does not seem to be predominantly cooled by ssc emission .",
    "the seds shown in petry et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and katarzyski , sol , & kus ( 2001 ) have a substantially harder synchrotron spectral index than @xmath64 , and the synchrotron luminosity consistently exceeds the ssc luminosity .",
    "the hbl pks  2155@xmath89304 exhibited soft x - ray spectral indices of @xmath901.7 during multiwavelength observations in 1994 may ( urry et al .  1997 ) .",
    "this suggests that ssc cooling was dominant during these epochs .",
    "unfortunately , simultaneous @xmath78-ray coverage was not available , so direct comparisons of the ssc and synchrotron luminosities can not be made .",
    "if ssc emission is the primary energy loss mechanism , then in the co - moving frame of the plasma blob , the synchrotron photon energy density must exceed the energy densities associated with the other relevant loss mechanisms , synchrotron emission and inverse compton scattering of external photons .",
    "for ssc cooling to exceed synchrotron cooling , this requires @xmath91 which follows from eq .",
    "this relation can yield additional constraints on the size scale and particle content of the emitting plasma by combining it with upper limits on the blob radius @xmath43 given by variability time scales , inferred values of the particle energy lower cut - off @xmath24 from x - ray spectral shapes , and values of the non - thermal particle density @xmath8 and magnetic field @xmath92 from fits to the observed optical and x - ray spectra .    comparing the synchrotron energy density to the energy densities of external radiation",
    "is problematic because of uncertainties regarding the amount of reprocessing of the central disk radiation the ambient matter in the quasar environment can provide . if the synchrotron spectrum does show the signature of ssc cooling , then constraints on the properties of this ambient matter follow . assuming it can be modeled by a spherical distribution with characteristic radius @xmath93 , and if the emitting plasma lies within this radius , then the energy density of reprocessed disk radiation in the blob frame is approximately since the energy density of reprocessed radiation inside of a spherically symmetric shell of material which reprocesses the flux from a central point source and re - emits it isotropically is approximately uniform throughout the interior of the shell",
    "this follows from a similar line of reasoning that the net gravitational force inside a uniform shell of matter is zero everywhere within the shell . ]",
    "@xmath94 here @xmath95 is the disk luminosity , and @xmath96 is the characteristic optical depth for reprocessing the disk radiation .",
    "contributions to this optical depth may include thomson scattering , resonant line scattering , scattering by dust , and pure absorption ( with subsequent re - emission ) . combining this with the expression for @xmath97 ( eq .  [ usyn ] ) and reasonable estimates of @xmath95 and @xmath1 , one can infer limits for the quantity @xmath98 . for epoch p5b for 3c  279 , hartman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) used @xmath99 , @xmath100pc , @xmath101erg  s@xmath102 , and parameters similar to those used to produce fig .",
    "[ example_seds ] .",
    "these parameters yield @xmath103 , confirming the dominance of ssc cooling .",
    "a similar calculation can be applied to the direct disk radiation ( ds93 ) , and for the 3c  279 epoch p5b model we find @xmath104 .",
    "although we have assumed that the blazar emission is produced in a single blob of plasma , this analysis also describes the time steady emission of a continuous jet of material in which the non - thermal electrons are injected at the base of the jet . as noted by hartman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , this is equivalent to a stream of discrete blobs . even for a single blob , deviations from the time - averaged spectrum in the optical and uv wavebands may only be detectable on fairly short time scales .",
    "for the 3c  279 epoch p5b parameters , the maximum energy of the instantaneous synchrotron spectrum has swept through the optical band after a time from the initial injection of @xmath105s as seen by a distant observer ( see eq .",
    "[ tmax_ssc ] ; here @xmath106 is the source redshift ) . in order to characterize variations in the injection of non - thermal particles or",
    "even to measure the spectral breaks associated with partially cooled particle distributions , optical and uv spectra must be taken on time scales shorter than @xmath107 .",
    "however , for mrk 421 , x - ray observations during the 1994 may flare were able to detect the associated spectral evolution ( takahashi et al .",
    "this implies that the size scale and/or particle density of the emitting plasma for this object were sufficiently small to yield relatively long cooling times ( see eq .",
    "[ tmax_ssc ] ) .",
    "finally , we note that this analysis underscores the role of doppler beaming in assessing the contribution of various emission processes to the overall energy balance of the emitting plasma .",
    "overly general assumptions about the apparent luminosity of the various inferred @xmath78-ray components may lead one to conclude that either external ic or ssc emission is the most important process for controlling the evolution of the relativistic particles in the jet outflow , when in fact the relative strength of these components is highly dependent on observer orientation ( dermer 1995 ) .",
    "we have shown that the presence ( or absence ) of a @xmath63 synchrotron spectral shape provides a much more reliable measure of these processes .",
