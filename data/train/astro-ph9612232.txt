    "absorption line studies of the low column density ly@xmath7 forest ( @xmath10 ; see hu et al .",
    "1995 ; lu et al .  1996 ; cristiani et al.1996 ) offer a unique probe of the universe which is free of luminosity bias , spans a wide redshift range @xmath11 and where the overdensity is mildly nonlinear ( overdensity @xmath0 , see hui , gnedin & zhang 1996 ) and hence the relevant physics is simple to understand .",
    "recent hydrodynamic simulations support the hypothesis that the ly@xmath7 forest arises from a fluctuating intergalactic medium which is the natural result of gravitational instability in hierarchical clustering cosmological models ( cen et al .",
    "1994 ; zhang et al .  1995 ; hernquist et al .  1996",
    "; miralda - escud et al .  1996 ;",
    "wadsley & bond 1996 ) .",
    "the main quantity of interest in such studies is the ly@xmath7 transmission ( or optical depth ) as a function of frequency , which is determined by the density of neutral hydrogen as a function of position .",
    "the gunn - peterson effect ( gunn & peterson 1965 ) tells us that hydrogen ( as well as helium ) is highly ionized for @xmath12 .",
    "several models for its origin have been studied : photoionization by first generation of stars or quasars , collisional ionization induced by shock - heated gas , decaying neutrinos and so on ( ikeuchi & ostriker 1986 ; couchman & rees 1986 ; sciama 1990 ; miralda - escud & ostriker 1992 ; shapiro , giroux , & babul 1994 ; giroux & shapiro 1996 ; haiman & loeb 1996 ) .",
    "the reader is also referred to shapiro ( 1995 ) for an excellent review on the subject .",
    "we focus on photoionization models in this paper although the semi - analytical method we propose in this paper can be applied to any model .",
    "ionization equilibrium , which should hold after the universe reionizes , dictates that the neutral hydrogen density is approximately proportional to @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the baryon density and @xmath15 is the temperature ( see   [ analytical ] ) .",
    "it is therefore important to know the amplitude of @xmath15 and its dependence on @xmath14 . as we will discuss later , the temperature - density relation can significantly affect observed properties of the ly@xmath7 forest , its column density distribution for instance .",
    "imagine a fluid element evolving in a photoionized intergalactic medium .",
    "its temperature at @xmath16 is influenced by a number of factors : how its density evolves with time , which determines the amount of heating / cooling ; how and when the ionizing radiation is turned on ; the radiation amplitude and spectrum , which control how much photoionization heating the fluid element suffers ; cosmological parameters such as baryon density , the hubble constant and the density parameter @xmath17 which affects the recombination rate , adiabatic cooling rate and the evolution of density .",
    "the temperature - density relation for a set of fluid elements is then determined by , among other things , the reionization history of the universe . given a reionization scenario and cosmological model , hydrodynamic simulations can predict this relation accurately , but limited computer resources obviously restrict the number of reionization histories one can study .",
    "it is therefore important that we develop alternative tools in order to understand the effects of a full range of reionization histories , considering the as yet poor knowledge of the actual reionization history of our universe .",
    "moreover , it is worth pointing out that there exists analytical tools borrowed from studies of large scale structure which can predict the distribution of @xmath14 with reasonable accuracy in the low density regime ( bi , borner & chu 1992 ; bi & davidsen 1996 ; gnedin & hui 1996 ; hui , gnedin & zhang 1996 ) . by their analytical / semi - analytical nature , it is possible to study a whole range of cosmological models in an efficient manner .",
    "what remains to be specified for these methods , in order to calculate quantities like the column density distribution of hydrogen , is the temperature - density relation .",
    "a calculation aiming at just that is attempted here .",
    "we propose to model the density evolution of each fluid element using the zeldovich approximation ( zeldovich 1970 ) , which is known to be a good approximation in the mildly nonlinear regime ( coles , melott , & shandarin 1993 ) and for elements where hydrodynamic effects like pressure and shock - heating are unimportant . given a probability distribution of the initial configuration for these elements , which can be deduced for any given cosmological model",
    ", one can generate a whole set of such elements and simply follow their thermal and chemical evolution .",
    "the resulting bulk temperature - density relation can then be studied for any chosen reionization history .",
    "the virtue of this method is that each element can be treated independently and that the density evolution is given by an analytical formula ( from the zeldovich approximation ) while the thermal and chemical evolution equations involve a set of ordinary differential equations which can be solved numerically .",
    "obviously , such a lagrangian method does not incorporate the effects of shock - heating properly .",
    "we check the results of our method against full hydrodynamic simulations and find good agreement for @xmath18 , implying shock effects are not significant in the low density regime (   [ simulation ] ) .",
    "most previous work investigating the effects of different reionization histories either assumes a uniform intergalactic medium ( eg .",
    "giroux & shapiro 1996 ) or uses the spherical collapse model for density evolution ( eg .",
    "miralda - escud & rees 1994 ) . for the low column density",
    "ly@xmath7 forest , which arises naturally from a mildly fluctuating intergalactic medium , and which hydrodynamic simulations indicate to be consisting mostly of filaments and pancakes ( cen et al .",
    "1994 ) , the density evolution is better approximated by the zeldovich approximation ( hui et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "a great deal of effort has been made to examine radiative transfer effects after the onset of ionizing radiation , including the expansion of @xmath19 regions , reprocessing by absorption systems etc .",
    "( zuo 1992a , b ; meiksin & madau 1993 ; miralda - escud & rees 1994 ; giroux & shapiro 1996 ; haardt & madau 1996 ; see also gnedin & ostriker 1996 for numerical simulations that include some of these effects ) .",
    "these effects can in principle be incorporated in our method by specifying how the radiation intensity correlates with density and possibly allowing the onset of reionization to occur at different times for different fluid elements . while more work still needs to be done in order to make such a specification with reasonable accuracy , we focus in this paper on reionization models in which the ionizing flux is uniform , but allowing the onset - epoch , spectrum and amplitude of the ionizing flux as well as the cosmology to vary .",
    "it turns out one can learn something about the more realistic fluctuating case , even from these simple models , which we will discuss in   [ discuss ] .",
    "as we will show , the mean temperature - density relation of the photoionized intergalactic medium in the low density regime is well - approximated by a power law equation of state ( @xmath20^{\\gamma-1}$ ] ) where @xmath21 is the mass overdensity ) .",
    "the questions we would like to address are then : how does the amplitude and slope of the equation of state depend on the reionization history , characteristics of the ionizing radiation as well as cosmological parameters ; what are the implications for observational properties of the ly@xmath7 forest ?",
    "organization of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    ", we outline a semi - analytical method to predict the temperature - density relation for any given cosmology and reionization history , using the zeldovich approximation .",
    "an example is discussed and a comparison is made with the result of a full hydrodynamic simulation , computed using the same reionization history .",
    "then , in   [ sudden ] we apply the method to study models in which the universe reionizes suddenly , due to a rapid outburst of radiation .",
    "we investigate systematically how varying the epoch of reionization , cosmological parameters and the radiation amplitude and spectrum affects the equation of state at later redshifts .",
    "analytical approximations to the equation of state are derived . in ",
    "[ preheat ] , it is shown that models in which reionization occurs after a period of reheating ( gradual turn - on of radiation ) give equations of state that can be well - fitted by that of an appropriate sudden reionization model .",
    "finally we discuss the implications of our findings for the observational properties of the lyman - alpha forest and the intergalactic medium in ",
    "[ discuss ] .",
    "a summary of relevant reaction rates is provided in the appendix .",
    "a few words about our terminology .",
    "the three different methods or procedures to study the effects of reionization history , are respectively referred to as `` analytical approximation '' , `` semi - analytical method '' and `` hydrodynamic simulation '' .",
    "the first is discussed in   [ sudden ] , where a few approximations are made to derive the equation of state in closed form ; the second is explained in   [ equation ] , which evolves the density analytically but requires numerical integration of the thermal and chemical evolution equations , though not a full scale hydrodynamic simulation and the third is what its name suggests . while the last method is perhaps the most accurate (",
    "provided the numerical resolution is sufficient ) , the second , which is the focus of this paper , allows us to study the temperature - density relation for a large number of reionization histories in an efficient and accurate manner , albeit restricted to the low density regime ; the first allows us to give useful approximate quantitative expressions that embody the correct qualitative trends .",
    "standard symbols are used for cosmological parameters : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the cosmological redshift factor , @xmath24 for the hubble constant as a function of @xmath25 , @xmath26 for the hubble constant today , @xmath27 for @xmath28 , @xmath29 for the density parameter today , with the subscript @xmath30 to denote its baryon portion and @xmath31 all its matter content , and @xmath32 for the contribution from cosmological constant .",
    "we use the symbol @xmath33 ( in distinct from @xmath27 ) to denote the planck constant in a few places where it arises and @xmath34 to denote the boltzman constant .",
    "in a nutshell , the method we propose is very simple : assume that the density evolution of a given fluid element is governed by the zeldovich approximation ; allow the element to cool / heat and its constituents to change according to standard thermal and chemical reaction rates ; repeat the same procedure for a whole set of fluid elements with initial parameters drawn from a distribution implied by whatever cosmological initial conditions one prefers ( in this paper , we study only gaussian random initial conditions )",
    ". the resulting temperature - density relation can be obtained by making a scatter - plot of temperature versus density for all the fluid elements at a given time of interest .    the density evolution of a fluid element , according to the zeldovich approximation ,",
    "is given by : @xmath35 \\ , , \\label{zadelta}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the mass overdensity , @xmath36 is the kronecker delta and @xmath37 is the linear growth factor ( peebles 1980 ) , the time dependence of which is completely specified by cosmology ( e.g. it equals the hubble scale factor @xmath38 for a universe at critical matter density ) .",
    "the normalization is chosen such that @xmath39 today .",
    "the tensor @xmath40 is a @xmath41 symmetric matrix determined by initial conditions ( i.e. its components vary from one fluid element to another ) .",
    "one can always choose a basis in which the matrix is diagonal .",
    "so , the problem of initial conditions reduces to finding the probability distribution of its three eigenvalues .",
    "this problem was solved by doroshkevich ( 1970 ) for gaussian random initial density field , ( see also bartelmann and schneider ( 1992 ) for an elegant alternative derivation ) which we also assume in this paper . for recent discussions of how to generate realizations of matrix @xmath40 ,",
    "see bertschinger and jain ( 1994 ) and reisenegger and miralda - escud ( 1995 ) .",
    "it can be shown that the probability distribution of the matrix @xmath40 is uniquely specified by the dispersion of its trace . in the limit where @xmath37 is small",
    ", it can be seen that the trace multiplied by @xmath42 is equal to @xmath21 i.e. the linear overdensity .",
    "therefore , the average of the trace vanishes and its rms ( root mean squared ) value is equal to the rms linear density fluctuation today @xmath43 . at a given redshift and for a fixed number of fluid elements ,",
    "a given rms @xmath43 value would imply a probable range of @xmath21 s in which most elements will end up .",
    "for the range we are interested in ( @xmath21 between about @xmath44 and @xmath45 , at @xmath25 from @xmath46 to @xmath47 ) , we find that setting the rms value @xmath43 to @xmath46 is adequate . for a fixed number of fluid elements , choosing a higher value for @xmath43",
    "has the effect of shifting the probable range of densities upward and also increasing the scatter in a plot of temperature versus density .",
    "alternatively , for a fixed rms value @xmath43 , one can reproduce this latter effect and increase the number of fluid elements that fall in the desired density range by increasing the total number of fluid elements in a realization .",
    "we find that for our densities and redshifts of interest , using a different @xmath43 does not change the overall temperature - density relation significantly .",
    "but it should be kept in mind the scatter in temperature - density relation is limited , in part , by the finite number of elements in the realizations .",
    "temperature obeys the following equation of evolution : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the lagrangian derivative following each fluid element , @xmath50 is the proper number density of all gas particles ( i.e. everything except noninteracting dark matter ) and @xmath15 is the temperature which depends on both space and time .",

    "for example the neutral fraction of hydrogen , @xmath57 ( to be distinguished from @xmath58 ) , is then @xmath59 . note that @xmath51 is a function of space and time in general .",

    "the third accounts for the change of internal energy per particle due to the change in the number of particles .",

    "[ fig3abcd]a , b , c and d , we show the temperature - density relation for four different sudden reionization models , where the reionization epoch is systematically varied .",
    "all of them have no ionizing background until the specified epoch and then @xmath75 ( eq . [ [ jhi ] ] ) is taken to be @xmath84 from thereon i.e. @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the hubble scale factor when the radiation is turned on and the parameter @xmath87 is chosen to be @xmath84 ( we will study the effects of varying @xmath87 later on ) .",

[ [ jhi ] ] ) has the desired value , @xmath92 is the frequency corresponding to the ionization of @xmath82 and @xmath93 ( now chosen to be @xmath94 ) is a parameter specifying by how much the ionizing radiation is to be further diminished beyond @xmath92 .    ignoring for the time being the solid , dotted and dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig3abcd ] which will be discussed in the next section , the first trend to notice is that the earlier the epoch of reionization , the lower the overall temperature at a given redshift , except that for sufficiently early reionization ( @xmath95 ) , the temperature - density relation approaches an asymptote .",
    "the second , somewhat striking , result is how well the temperature - density relations are approximated by power - law equations of state , where the slope steepens as universe reionizes earlier .",
    "the third is that when the reionization epoch is pushed sufficiently early , the exact time when it occurs makes very little difference to the equation of state : hence the very similar temperature - density relations for reionization starting at @xmath96 and @xmath97 in fig .",
    "[ fig3abcd]c and [ fig3abcd]d .    to understand these trends , we perform the following approximate analytical calculation .",
    "first , let us determine the reionization temperature . in the limit when a substantial amount of radiation is suddenly turned on , one can approximate equations ( [ t ] ) and ( [ n ] ) by : @xmath98 where we have used equation ( [ p ] ) and have taken the crude approximation that the only two processes which significantly affect the temperature under the short timescale of reionization ( reciprocal of photoionization rate ) are photoionization heating of hydrogen : @xmath99 and the change in the total number of gas particles . note that during this brief period of radiation turn - on , the abundances of various species are far from equilibrium .    to integrate the above equations , we adopt the further approximation that the universe has only hydrogen , i.e.  the term @xmath100 .",
    "putting @xmath101 right before reionization because the temperature right after is much higher , we obtain the large time limit of @xmath15 : @xmath102\\ , , \\label{treion}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 is kept constant after the radiation field is turned on .",
    "this is the temperature that the intergalactic medium reaches asymptotically before recombination processes become important and halts the exponential decrease of @xmath104 , setting its value to that implied by ionization equilibrium thereafter ( hydrogen is now highly ionized ) . making use of @xmath105 , it can be shown that @xmath106 .",
    "this value is not significantly affected by the slope of @xmath107 assuming it is between @xmath108 and @xmath109 at frequencies immediately above @xmath110 , nor by the behavior of @xmath107 at still higher frequencies .",
    "therefore , the first conclusion to draw is that for sudden reionization models , the temperature of reionization is largely independent of @xmath111 , density , the epoch of reionization or even cosmology .",
    "we checked this for a few fluid elements in the computations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3abcd ] and found that it is indeed the case .",
    "one possible exception , which we will discuss in   [ spectrum ] , is that changing the spectrum of @xmath67 can affect the helium abundance , which in turn has a non - negligible effect on @xmath112 . for sufficiently high redshifts , @xmath113",
    ", we also find @xmath112 to be a little less than the value given above , because of non - negligible amount of compton cooling .",
    "next , we consider the evolution of @xmath15 from the epoch of reionization to @xmath114 and @xmath47",
    ". judging from the result in fig .",
    "[ fig3abcd ] that for sufficiently early reionization , the temperature - density relation approaches an asymptote , it seems reasonable to assume that what matters is the dominant thermal and chemical reaction rates at the later redshifts . in this regime ,",
    "the dominant heating mechanism is again the photoionization of neutral hydrogen , aside from adiabatic heating / cooling ( recall that we assume a universe filled with only hydrogen ) . for sufficiently low temperature , recombination ( of proton and electron ) cooling",
    "is subdominant compared to photoionization heating ( at temperature of the order of @xmath115 , recombination cooling rate is smaller but actually not negligible compared to photoionization heating ; it is again a crude approximation we adopt to make the problem tractable analytically ) .",
    "putting all these into equation ( [ t ] ) , the thermal evolution is then approximated by : @xmath116 where we have ignored the term in equation ( [ t ] ) due to the change in the number of species , used equations ( [ p ] ) , ( [ qphoto ] ) and ( [ treion ] ) and assumed ionization equilibrium ( setting the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ [ n ] ] to zero ) , with @xmath117 approximately given by @xmath118 a more accurate expression for @xmath117 is given in the appendix and used for our semi - analytical computation but this approximate form suffices for the present analytical calculation .",
    "moreover , assuming again there is only hydrogen in the universe , we will approximate @xmath119 by @xmath120 ( recall that hydrogen is now highly ionized ) .",
    "even with this highly simplified equation , the problem of predicting the temperature - density relation is still untractable analytically , if one uses the density evolution as expressed in equation ( [ zadelta ] ) .",
    "one possible approximation is to assume the collapse / expansion occurs only along one direction i.e. @xmath121 where @xmath122 is a constant specified by initial conditions .",
    "equation ( [ tapprox1 ] ) can then be solved analytically but it turns out the resulting equations of state differ qualitatively from the ones shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3abcd ] in the sense that at high and low densities , the predicted temperature tends to be higher than what it actually is .",
    "this is because in three dimensions , most fluid elements that reach higher densities do so by having one axis collapsing while the two others expand . by ignoring the expansion in the other two axes ( as in a one - dimensional calculation ) and thereby missing extra adiabatic cooling ,",
    "the temperature is systematically over - estimated .",
    "moreover , most elements that reach the lower densities also have at least two axes expanding and so the one - dimensional calculation again underestimates the amount of cooling .",
    "the combination of both effects conspire to give an equation of state that resembles a power - law for genuine three - dimensional fluid elements .",
    "the next best question to ask is then : given that the outcome is a power - law equation of state , can we at least predict its amplitude and slope ? to do so , we turn to linear theory .",
    "we expand the logarithm of @xmath15 to first order in @xmath21 : @xmath123 \\ , , \\label{texpand}\\ ] ] where @xmath124 is simply the temperature of a fluid element that remains at the cosmic mean density and @xmath125 multiplied by @xmath21 gives the fluctuation about the mean ( the notation @xmath126 is chosen to agree with the common notation as in eq .

    "the idealization of sudden reionization in the last section allows us to understand the various trends of the temperature - density relation analytically .",

    "this is motivated by hydrodynamic simulations ( see gnedin & ostriker 1996 ) in which collapsed regions of high density ( could be stars / quasars ) are assumed to give out radiation . as the formation rate of these regions increases with time and the neutral fraction drops steadily , the ionizing intensity climbs until at some point , the universe becomes highly ionized ( neutral fraction of hydrogen less than @xmath184 ) , thus completing the reionization process when the radiation levels off and species abundances are simply given by ionization equilibrium . the simulation shown in fig .",

    "what do all these imply for the observable properties of the low column density ly@xmath7 forest ?",

    "( 1996 ) for a more detailed discussion of the predictions of various cosmological models for @xmath218 .",
    "the temperature - density relation also has significant implications for the @xmath30 parameter distribution .",
    "there exists a rather sharp lower cut - off of about @xmath220 according to high resolution data of the low column density ly@xmath7 observation ( hu et al .  1996 ) . if one naively assumes the observed @xmath30 is completely a result of thermal broadening @xmath221 , one obtains a lower cut - off temperature of about @xmath222 .",
    "judging from fig .",
    "[ fig3abcd ] , it is clear that at @xmath223 , which is the relevant redshift for these observations , unless the universe reionizes quite a bit later than @xmath224 , all the underdense regions ( and including some overdense regions too , depending on the reionization history ) have lower temperature that this cut - off .",
    "this is true even if one allows for a lot of helium photoionization heating or very little helium recombination cooling by varying the spectrum ( see fig .",
    "[ spectrum_fig8 ] ) .",
    "there are a few possible resolutions : first , it is possible that the low column density objects that we observe ( column density lower than about @xmath225 ) actually correspond to higher densities ( @xmath21 ) , but that would imply a very high @xmath75 ( higher than about @xmath226 ) which is difficult to reconcile with observations ( see hui et al .",
    "1996 ) ; second , it could be that the universe is not photo - reionized after all and some other mechanism is at work ; third , the observed @xmath30 parameter for these low column density systems is not the result of thermal broadening alone .",
    "we consider the last possibility the most likely one . as we have argued in an earlier paper ( hui et al .",
    "1996 ) and was pointed out before by numerous authors ( see for instance cen et al .",
    "1994 ; hernquist et al .  1996 ; miralda - escud et al.1996 ; zhang et al .  1995 ) , the observed absorption profiles do not necessarily conform to the classic voigt profile but can instead reflect more the underlying mass density profile and peculiar velocity structure .",
    "for instance , a structure collapsing perpendicular to the line of sight ( thus having density enhancement to induce enhanced absorption ) can have an expanding velocity component along the line of sight , thus creating a profile broader than what naive thermal broadening would predict .",
    "finally , let us speculate on how a fluctuating ionizing field might change the results of our paper . from fig .",
    "[ spectrum_fig8 ] , it is clear that a fluctuating field with inhomogeneous spectrum can certainly introduce a lot of scatter to the temperature - density relation , by giving different photoionization heating and recombination cooling rates even for fluid elements with the same density evolution .",
    "moreover , the ionizing field can also turn on at different times for different fluid elements because of radiative transfer effects ( zuo 1992a , b ) .",
    "this would introduce additional scatter because as we have seen , the earlier the reionization epoch , the lower the temperature at a given redshift .",
    "however , we also learn that the temperature - density relation approaches an asymptotic limit if one waits long enough . for sufficiently early reionization , neither the amplitude of @xmath75 nor the reionization history ( eg . at",
    "what different times radiation turns on at different elements ) affects the temperature very much , assuming @xmath75 is large enough to keep the universe reionized ( see   [ spectrum ] ) .",
    "therefore , provided the amplitude of @xmath67 at the helium ionizing frequencies does not vary significantly with position at later times @xmath227 , the equation of state we calculate for the early reionization models should be valid , even if the amplitude of @xmath75 fluctuates at @xmath227 .",
