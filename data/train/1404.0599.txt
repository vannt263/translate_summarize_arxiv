    "let us start explaining the meaning of _ kinematic expansiveness _ discussing a well known physical example .",
    "consider the differential equation of a simple pendulum : @xmath0 it is known since galileo galilei that the period of the oscillations is almost constant if the amplitude is small .",
    "but , if @xmath1 is the period of an oscillation of amplitude @xmath2 it can be proved that @xmath3 is strictly increasing for @xmath4 ( see for example @xcite for a proof ) .",
    "consider two close initial positions of the pendulum with vanishing initial velocities .",
    "since the periods of the oscillations are different , we have that the solutions will be separated at some time .",
    "this is the meaning of kinematic expansiveness .",
    "a key point for a pendulum clock as a practical timekeeper is that this separation time is large .",
    "in fact , it is easy to see that the separation is linear in time .",
    "this is a special feature of kinematic expansiveness , they are not so chaotic as a system with exponential error propagation .",
    "in this paper we mainly study dynamical systems on surfaces , therefore we consider the usual change of variables @xmath5 and @xmath6 , to transform the equation of the pendulum into a first order differential equation in the plane .",
    "consider two periodic solutions @xmath7 and @xmath8 bounding an annulus @xmath9 in the plane . if @xmath10 is the action of @xmath11 on @xmath9 induced by the pendulum equations we have our first example of a kinematic expansive flow on a compact surface .",
    "precise definitions are given in the following section .",
    "the above considerations are related with the stability ( or unstability ) of trajectories in the sense of lyapunov . in dynamical systems ,",
    "another fundamental concept is the _ structural stability _ due to andronov and pontryagin .",
    "a system is structurally stable if there is a neighborhood of the system ( in a specified topology ) such that every system of this neighborhood has an _ equivalent _ behavior . in the discrete time case ,",
    "two diffeomorphisms @xmath12 of a manifold @xmath13 are equivalent or _",
    "conjugated _ if there is a homeomorphism @xmath14 such that @xmath15 . in the continuous time case",
    ", one can say that two flows @xmath16 and @xmath17 are conjugated if there is a homeomorphism @xmath18 as before such that @xmath19 for all @xmath20 .",
    "this concept is very restrictive , because if there is a closed trajectory then its period should be preserved under perturbations .",
    "but this is impossible because slightly changing the velocities of the system one obtains a small perturbation ( on any reasonable topology ) and the periods of the perturbed system are different",
    ". therefore , we must consider the concept of _ topological equivalence_. two flows are topologically equivalent if there is a homeomorphism that preserves trajectories and orientations . if the homeomorphism is the identity of the phase space we have that each flow is a ( global ) _ time change _ of the other .",
    "it is also called a _",
    "reparametrization _ of the flow .",
    "if one is allowed to change the velocities of single trajectories , the distance between two whole orbits can be measured with the _ frchet distance_. if @xmath21 are continuous curves on a metric space @xmath22 , then the frchet or _ geometric _ distance between the curves is @xmath23 where @xmath24 varies in the set of increasing homeomorphisms of @xmath11 .",
    "this takes us to the concept of _ geometric expansiveness _",
    ", that is similar to kinematic expansiveness but allowing time reparametrizations of trajectories .",
    "this concept was first considered in the literature by anosov to prove the structural stability of now called anosov flows .",
    "later , bowen and walters introduced a definition of expansive flow , see @xcite , that on arbitrary compact metric spaces allowed them to prove some properties shared with anosov flows .",
    "their definition is of a _ geometric _ nature , that is , they require that trajectories are separated even allowing time changes of single orbits . in @xcite",
    "it is noticed that kinematic expansiveness is not enough in order to recover results of hyperbolic flows . in the introduction of cited paper",
    "they consider a flow topologically equivalent with the pendulum system described above .",
    "some of the results in @xcite were generalized in @xcite considering different families of reparametrizations and acting groups .",
    "a different and very interesting kind of expansiveness was discovered by gura . in @xcite",
    ", he proved that the horocycle flow of a surface with negative curvature is positive and negative ( kinematic ) separating , his definition requires to separate every pair of points in different orbits .",
    "he also proved a remarkable result : every _ global _ time change of such flow is positive and negative kinematic separating .",
    "it is known that horocycle flow is not geometric expansive .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study kinematic expansiveness .",
    "examples and basic properties are mainly stated on compact surfaces .",
    "a special feature of kinematic expansiveness is the non - invariance under global time changes .",
    "therefore we also consider the definition of strong kinematic expansiveness requiring that every global time change must be kinematic expansive .",
    "a natural question is : why call it strong kinematic and not weak geometric ?",
    "the answer can be found in the following example .",
    "consider @xmath25 a vector field in a two - dimensional torus @xmath26 generating an irrational flow .",
    "take a non - negative map @xmath27 with just one zero at @xmath28 .",
    "define the vector field @xmath29 and let @xmath16 be its associated flow .",
    "as we will see , @xmath16 and its global time changes are kinematic expansive .",
    "the separation of trajectories is not geometric because generic orbits are parallel straight lines .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",

    "we consider flows on compact surfaces .",
    "we prove that on surfaces every geometric separating flow is geometric expansive ( i.e. @xmath30-expansive in the sense of komuro @xcite ) .",
    "we also show that a flow on a surface is strong kinematic expansive if and only if it is strong separating ; and also equivalent with : its singularities are of saddle type and the union of the separatrices is dense in the surface .",

    "we give a characterization of arc homeomorphisms admitting a kinematic expansive suspension .",
    "we prove that the only @xmath31 diffeomorphism of an interval admitting a kinematic expansive suspension is the identity .",
    "a similar study is done for circle homeomorphisms and diffeomorphisms .",
    "section [ seckinsurf ] .",
    "we consider kinematic expansive flows of surfaces .",
    "we study the relationship between singularities and kinematic expansiveness in the disc and in the annulus .",
    "we show that every compact surface admits a kinematic expansive flow .",
    "section [ secpositive ] . for positive geometric expansive flows on compact metric spaces",
    "it is known ( see @xcite ) that the dynamic is trivial ( a finite number of compact orbits ) .",
    "the case of positive kinematic expansiveness is different , as is shown in the examples of this section .",
    "we study the local behavior of the flow near a compact orbit . on surfaces ,",
    "we prove that positive expansive flows are suspensions and has no singularities .",
    "the smooth case is also considered .",
    "we consider a variation of an example in @xcite to show ( on a compact metric space ) that a positive kinematic expansive flow may not be negative kinematic expansive .",
    "section [ secrobust ] . in this section",
    "we consider perturbations of @xmath31 kinematic expansive vector fields .",
    "we first give a sufficient condition for robust kinematic expansiveness for conservative vector fields in the annulus .",
    "finally we consider a general manifold and vector fields without singularities . in this",
    "setting we prove that @xmath31-robust kinematic expansiveness implies geometric expansiveness ( i.e. , expansiveness in the sense of bowen and walters @xcite ) .",
    "in this section we present the main definitions .",
    "let @xmath22 be a compact metric space and @xmath32 be a continuous flow .",
    "we say that @xmath33 is a _",
    "singularity _ or an _ equilibrium _ point of @xmath16 if @xmath34 for all @xmath20 . to understand any definition of expansive flow one must consider the following simple fact .",
    "it holds that if there is at least one non - singular point @xmath35 then for all @xmath36 there exists @xmath37 , such that @xmath38 and for all @xmath20 , @xmath39 .",
    "moreover , the value of @xmath40 may be as small as we want .    then , if we are going to define a notion of expansive or separating flow we must take care of points in the same orbit . in the subject of expansive flows we consider the hierarchy shown in table [ tablaexp ] .",
    "@xmath41    the terms _ kinematic _ and _ geometric _ first appear in the literature of expansive systems ( to our best knowledge ) in @xcite ( page 138 ) .",
    "definitions in the left column of the table separate every pair of points not being in the same _ local _ orbit , and the ones in the right separate points in different _ global _ orbits .",
    "strong expansiveness deals with time changes of the whole flow and the geometric notions allows time changes of single orbits . as the reader will see , the implications indicated by the arrows are easy to prove",
    "now we give the precise definitions , examples and counterexamples showing that no arrow in the table can be reversed in the general setting of compact metric spaces .",
    "we also state some basic properties .",
    "let us start with the main notion of the paper .",

    "this definition was also mentioned in ( the first section of ) @xcite .",
    "two continuous flows @xmath46 and @xmath47 are said to be _ equivalent _ if there exists a homeomorphism @xmath48 such that @xmath49 for all @xmath50 .",
    "clearly , kinematic expansiveness is invariant under flow equivalence , i.e. , it does not depend on the metric defining the topology of @xmath25 .",
    "a continuous flow @xmath51 is _ topologically equivalent _ with @xmath52 if there is a homeomorphism @xmath48 such that for each @xmath35 the orbits @xmath53 and @xmath54 and its orientations coincide .",
    "if in addition , the homeomorphism @xmath18 is the identity of @xmath25 , we say that @xmath16 is a _ time change _ of @xmath17 .",
    "the following example is topologically equivalent with the pendulum system ( restricted to an annulus as mentioned above ) and shows that a time change can destroy kinematic expansiveness .",
    "[ annulus ] consider the annulus in the plane @xmath55\\}\\ ] ] bounded by circles of radius 1 and 2 .",
    "a flow @xmath16 on @xmath9 can be defined by the equation @xmath56 the solutions are circles as shown in figure [ perannulus ] .",
    "it is easy to see that this flow is kinematic expansive ( there is a proof in example 2 of @xcite page 84 ) .",
    "the equation @xmath57 defines a time change of @xmath16 that is not kinematic expansive because the angular velocities are constant .    at the end of definition [ dfkexp ] above",
    ", we required that the points @xmath58 and @xmath59 are in a orbit segment of small time .",
    "since our phase space is compact , this segment has a small diameter too .",
    "notice that the converse is true if there are no singularities , i.e. , orbit segments of small diameter are defined by small times .",
    "but if there is a singularity accumulated by regular orbits this is no longer true as the reader can verify , just apply the continuity of the flow at the singular point .    in spite of this remark",
    "we will show that if we require in definition [ dfkexp ] that @xmath58 and @xmath59 are in a orbit segment of small diameter ( instead of small time ) we obtain an equivalent definition .",
