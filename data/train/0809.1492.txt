    "<S> we investigate the antiferromagnetic ( af ) order in the @xmath0-wave superconducting ( sc ) state at high magnetic fields . a two - dimensional model with on - site repulsion @xmath1 , inter - site attractive interaction @xmath2 and antiferromagnetic exchange interaction @xmath3 is solved using the mean field theory . for finite values of @xmath1 and @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> , a first order transition occurs from the normal state to the fflo state , while the fflo - bcs phase transition is second order , consistent with the experimental results in cecoin@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> although the bcs - fflo transition is continuous , the nel temperature of af order is discontinuous at the phase boundary because the af order in the fflo state is induced by the andreev bound state localized in the zeros of fflo order parameter , while the af order hardly occurs in the uniform bcs state . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial structure of the magnetic moment is investigated for the commensurate af state as well as for the incommensurate af state . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the spin fluctuations is discussed for both states . </S>",
    "<S> since the fluctuations are enhanced in the normal state for incommensurate af order , this af order can be confined in the fflo state . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results in cecoin@xmath4 are discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> the fflo superconducting state at high magnetic fields was predicted in 1960 s by fulde and ferrel  @xcite and larkin and ovchinnikov  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the u@xmath5-gauge symmetry the spatial symmetry is broken by the modulation of the sc order parameter . after nearly 40 years of fruitless experimental search for fflo states recent experiments appeared to give first evidences for such a phase  @xcite . moreover , the fflo phase enjoys growing interesting in other related fields such as in cold atomic gases  @xcite and in high - density quark matter  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> extensive studies of the fflo state had been triggered by the discovery of a novel sc phase in cecoin@xmath4  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although several experimental results suggest the emergence of a fflo state here  @xcite , some nmr and neutron scattering data rather indicate the presence of af order  @xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we theoretically examine the possibility of the coexistence of af order and fflo superconductivity .    </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical analysis is based on the following model , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the spin operator and @xmath8 is the number operator at site @xmath9 . in order to describe the quasi - two - dimensional electronic structure of cecoin@xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> we assume for simplicity a square lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the bracket @xmath10 denotes the summation over the nearest neighbor sites . </S>",
    "<S> the on - site repulsive interaction is given by @xmath11 , and @xmath2 and @xmath3 stand for the attractive interaction and antiferromagnetic exchange interaction , respectively , between nearest neighbor sites . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 stabilizes the @xmath0-wave sc state and @xmath12 takes into account the antiferromagnetic correlation in cecoin@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> it has been experimentally shown that cecoin@xmath4 is close to the quantum critical point ( qcp ) of af order  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the other candidate materials for fflo superconductivity are also close to the qcp of af order  @xcite . these features , namely the @xmath0-wave superconductivity and af correlation , can be described using the flex approximation for the simple hubbard model  @xcite . but here , we assume the interactions @xmath2 and @xmath3 to describe the fflo superconductivity near the qcp within the mean field theory . with the last term in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) we include the zeeman coupling due to the applied magnetic field parallel to the _ ab_-plane . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the following tight - binding model , @xmath13 where the unit of energy is @xmath14 and we fix @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the chemical potential enters as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number density for @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the stable af ordered state depends on the parameter @xmath19 which determines the electron number . </S>",
    "<S> the commensurate af order with @xmath20 appears for @xmath21 while an incommensurate af state with @xmath22 or @xmath23 is obtained for @xmath24 .    </S>",
    "<S> we examine the model ( 1 ) within the bogoliubov - degennes ( bdg ) theory by taking into account the hartree - term arising from @xmath1 and @xmath3 . the hatree - term due to the attractive interaction @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> is ignored because this term does not have any spin dependence as is essential for the following results . </S>",
    "<S> we first determine the phase diagram for the normal , uniform bcs and fflo states and later examine the magnetic instability in these states . </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to include both the on - site repulsion @xmath1 and antiferromagnetic @xmath3 in order to reproduce the experimental results in cecoin@xmath4  @xcite . for our choice of the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 , </S>",
    "<S> the first order phase transition occurs from the normal state to the fflo state , while the bcs - fflo transition is second order , consistent with the experimental results  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fflo state is suppressed for @xmath27 if we assume @xmath28 , while the normal - to - fflo phase transition is second order around the tricritical point for @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> this is incompatible with the phase diagram of cecoin@xmath4 indicating that the phase diagram of fflo superconductivity is significantly affected by the electron correlation .    , </S>",

    "<S> , width=340 ]    figures  1(a ) and 1(b ) show the results for @xmath21 and @xmath24 , respectively . for both cases af order occurs in the fflo and normal states , but is absent in the uniform bcs state . </S>",
    "<S> the nel temperature @xmath35 of the af order shifts discontinuously at the phase boundary between fflo and normal state as well as between fflo and uniform bcs state . </S>",
    "<S> the discontinuity at the former phase boundary is simply owing to the jump of sc order parameter at the first order phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the latter discontinuity seems more surprising because that phase boundary is second order . </S>",
    "<S> the key lies in the appearance of andreev bound states around the spatial nodes of the modulated sc order parameter in the fflo state which introduce @xmath36-phase shifts in the sc order parameter as shown in the upper panel of fig .  2 . </S>",
    "<S> the continuous phase transition from the uniform bcs to fflo state is associated with the nucleation of these domain walls like structures as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the andreev bound states localized around such domain walls lead to the large quasiparticle density of states at the fermi energy and induce the af instability . </S>",
    "<S> the lower panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 shows that the af staggered moment is indeed localized around the domain walls . </S>",
    "<S> because the coupling between the neighboring domain walls is weak , the nel temperature is almost independent of the density of walls . </S>",
    "<S> since the dos is suppressed by the sc order parameter without @xmath36-phase shift , the af order is absent in the uniform bcs state . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the @xmath37 is discontinuous although the averaged magnetic moment is continuous at the phase boundary between the uniform bcs state and fflo state .    </S>",

    "<S> width=604 ]    the discontinuity of @xmath35 at the normal - fflo transition is qualitatively different between the commensurate af order and the incommensurate af order . as shown in fig .  1 , </S>",
    "<S> the af order is slightly enhanced ( suppressed ) by the fflo order in case of the incommensurate ( commensurate ) af order . </S>",
    "<S> the two dimensional spatial dependence of incommensurate af moment is depicted in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> it is reasonable to assume the fflo modulation vector parallel to the magnetic field @xmath55 because the vortex lattice favors this configuration  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> 3(a , b ) and 3(c , d ) show the af moment for the magnetic field along [ 100 ] direction , and [ 110 ] direction , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the incommensurate structure along the nodal plane of fflo order parameter is favored in both cases . </S>",
    "<S> we examined the possibility of incommensurate af order perpendicular to the nodal plane , in which the @xmath36 phase shift of af order parameter is pinned by the fflo modulation . however , this af state is less favorable than the af state shown in fig .  3 within the mean field theory .     </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath56 which favors the incommensurate af order . the fflo modulation vector in each figure is given in the text . </S>",
    "<S> the other parameters are the same as in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> , width=718 ]    next we discuss the experimental results for cecoin@xmath4  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the af order observed at high magnetic fields and low temperatures might be considered as the coexistent state of fflo superconductivity and af order . </S>",
    "<S> however , according to our result this would imply the existence of af order in the normal state too , in contrast to the experimental observation . </S>",
    "<S> while this discrepancy could be resolved using a more realistic electronic band structure of cecoin@xmath4 , we propose a scenario based on specific fluctuations of the af wave vector @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the spin susceptibility is enhanced at the incommensurate wave vector @xmath58 with a negligible anisotropy in the small @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> such directional fluctuations are suppressed in the fflo phase due to the anisotropy introduced by the fflo nodal planes . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the spin fluctuations are enhanced in the fflo state because of the reduced effective dimensionality . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the realization of af long range order in the fflo phase depends on a subtle balance . </S>",
    "<S> if the directional fluctuation plays an quantitatively important role , the af order in the normal state is suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> the idea of directional fluctuation of the incommensurate af correlation could be tested by neutron scattering measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the way af order and fflo superconductivity coexist can be experimentally examined by the pressure measurements because the af order is likely suppressed by the pressure in analogy with the case of cerhin@xmath4  @xcite . </S>"
