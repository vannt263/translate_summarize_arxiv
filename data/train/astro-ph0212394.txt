    "the observations presented herein were made with the 2.15 meter viper telescope during the austral winter of 1999 . at the time",
    ", viper was fitted with a two pixel receiver instrument known as corona that measured the total incident power in the frequency range 38 to 44 ghz ( @xmath12 , coble et al .",
    "1999 ) using hemt ( high electron mobility transistor ) amplifiers .",
    "the following features make viper ideally suited to the observation of low redshift clusters such as a3667 ; its location at the south pole , the two story conical shield and the flat chopping tertiary mirror that sweeps the telescope beam backward and forward by up to @xmath13 in co - elevation .",
    "the south pole is one of the driest sites in the world ( peterson et al .",
    "2002 ) , the shield minimizes ground pick up and the chopper permits observations of clusters that are extended over large areas of the sky .    using corona on viper ,",
    "we have generated a 40 ghz image of a @xmath14 region centered on a3667 .",
    "we did so using a raster scan technique that involved taking measurements during eight complete chopper cycles at each of 25 fixed elevation positions separated by @xmath15 ( roughly one third of a beam ) .",
    "for the a3667 observation , we used a @xmath13 chopper throw ( the maximum possible ) and read out the instrument 512 times per 2.15 s@xmath6 chopper cycle , resulting in measurements separated by @xmath16 in the azimuth direction . including overheads ,",
    "each raster scan map took a little over a minute to complete . in total , 3,103 raster scans were made over six contiguous days : may 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 & june 1 , 2 1999 .",
    "every two hours during that period , the carina nebula was observed as a pointing check . during our observation ,",
    "the corona beam pattern was well described by a radially symmetric gaussian with a fwhm of @xmath17 ( @xmath2 ) and the total calibration uncertainty was 8% ( peterson et al 2000 ) .",
    "the raster scan data were initially stored as a time stream of detector voltages .",
    "the first stage of the analysis was to apply a filter to the time stream .",
    "this corrected for the detector response function ; removed high frequency noise ; and eliminated any signal coupled to the power mains , by removing harmonics of 60 hz .",
    "next noisy and/or poor quality scans were flagged and cut from the analysis : those with any @xmath18 voltage spikes , those with tracking or chopping position errors greater than two arc - minutes , those for which the amplifiers were warmer than 25k , those with excessive noise at harmonics of 60 hz , those with rapidly varying voltages and those with an unusually high average voltage .",
    "we note that the first data cut removed electrical interference in the data , and the latter two helped remove time periods when clouds were moving across the field of view .",
    "once all seven cuts had been applied , 1518 scans of the initial 3103 remained or @xmath1936 hours of integration .    as it is conventional to express cmb intensity changes as changes in brightness temperature , @xmath20 , the next stage of the analysis involved converting the voltage time stream into a @xmath20 time stream using the detector calibration .",
    "then the 1518 sets of time stream were converted into grid maps consisting of 512 rows and 25 columns each .",
    "next , the grid maps needed to be corrected for contaminating signals known collectively as `` chopper synchronous offsets '' .",
    "these offsets can include signals originating from the ground , the atmosphere and the telescope components .",
    "the offset level varies with chopper position because , as the chopper moves , the focal plane is illuminated by different areas of the telescope optics ( see peterson et al .",
    "2000 ) . under the assumption that the offsets change linearly with elevation , and maintained the same general waveform in the azimuth ( chopping ) direction ,",
    "the offsets were removed from the inner regions of the scans as follows . the linear component in the elevation direction",
    "was removed by fitting to the top and bottom 4 rows in each of the columns .",
    "next , the linear component in the azimuth direction was removed by fitting to the first and last 50 columns in each of the rows .",
    "after offset correction , the @xmath21 points in the offset subtracted grid maps were assigned sky coordinates using the peterson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) telescope pointing model .",
    "finally , the maps were converted into fully sampled images with @xmath22 pixels .",
    "linear interpolation in the elevation direction was used to create these images because the grid points in the raster scan were separated by @xmath15 in elevation ( compared to @xmath23 in azimuth ) .    in figures  [ fig : szall ] and [ fig : sz1degree ] we present the result of averaging the 1,518 fully sampled images together . in these figures ,",
    "the data have been smoothed with a @xmath24 fwhm gaussian kernel , which gives them an effective resolution of @xmath25 fwhm ( the beam size of the instrument was @xmath2 ) .",
    "the effective beam fwhm has been represented by the red circle in the bottom right corner of figure  [ fig : sz1degree ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : szall ] we present the full dimensions of the co - added image , including the edge regions used for the offset subtraction .",
    "the elongated blue ( cold ) region in the center of the image corresponds to the position of a3667 .",
    "other cold structures in the map most likely correspond to fluctuations due to receiver noise , primary cmb anisotropies , or artifacts of the offset removal .",
    "it is unlikely , given the sensitivity and spatial resolution , that any of the cold spots in the map correspond to serendipitous cluster detections . over the inner region of the smoothed image , _",
    "i.e. _ the region not used for offset subtraction , the standard deviation per @xmath26 pixel was found to be @xmath27 k. when deriving this random noise estimate , we assumed that the noise was gaussian and that each scan was independent .",
    "we tested the latter assumption by re - calculating the noise after averaging into groups of first five and then twenty consecutive scans .",
    "grouping the scans in this way before calculating the standard deviation in each pixel did not change the noise estimate .",
    "this supports our assumption that the noise was uncorrelated in time ; if it had been , this test would have resulted in an increase in the measured standard deviation .    in figure  [",
    "fig : sz1degree ] we compare the inner @xmath28 of the corona map with x - ray and radio images of the same region .",
    "note that for these comparisons , the corona data were rebinned to the pspc pixel scale ( @xmath29 ) and that this smooths out the ( @xmath26 ) pixelization apparent in figure  [ fig : szall ] .",
    "the white contours in the figure correspond to the 0.4 - 2.0 kev x - ray count rate as measured by the pspc instrument on the rosat satellite .",
    "the x - ray count rate map was generated from data in the rosat public archive using the data reduction pipeline designed for the sharc survey ( romer et al .",
    "this data reduction pipeline was based on the esas routines of snowden et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and includes the production of a complementary 0.4 - 2.0 kev exposure map that was used during the model fitting described below ( section  [ subsec : max - likefit ] ) .",
    "the black contours correspond to the interferometric radio map at 843 mhz created with the most interferometer ( hunstead et al .",
    "1999 ; richard hunstead , private communication ) .    from figure",
    "[ fig : sz1degree ] , it is clear that there is a significant extended cold area close to the center of the x - ray emission . at the centroid ( @xmath30 j2000 ) of the x - ray emission ,",
    "the temperature decrement in the smoothed corona map is @xmath31k .",
    "there is also a some evidence for correlations between hot regions in the image and the most radio contours . taken together",
    ", the various correlations between the corona map and the x - ray and radio maps support the claim in peterson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) that the corona pointing reconstruction is accurate to within @xmath32 .",
    "the extended radio emission to the north - west of the cluster has been discussed in rttgering et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and roettiger , burns and stone ( 1999 ) .",
    "both groups suggest that a merging event has produced turbulence in the outer region of the cluster which in turn amplifies magneitc fields , reaccelerates relativistic particles and thus produces radio emission",
    ". radio contamination can be a serious concern when creating sze images , _",
    "e.g. _ rx j1347 - 1145 ( pointecouteau et al . 1999 , 2001",
    "; komatsu et al .",
    "2001 ) . however , as there is no evidence of radio contamination in the region of the cluster used for the @xmath7 measurement ( section  [ sec : ho ] ) , _",
    "i.e. _ the core of the cluster , we do not discuss the radio emission from a3667 again in this paper .    as mentioned above",
    ", the random noise per pixel in figure  [ fig : szall ] is @xmath27 k. in addition , the images are contaminated by primary cmb anisotropies .",
    "we have estimated the level of the cmb contamination in the corona images to be @xmath33k rms using the netterfield et al .",
    "( 2001 ) anisotropy power spectrum and assuming a top hat window function with @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , some of the features visible in this figure could correspond to @xmath35 cmb fluctuations .",
    "for this reason , we can not rule out that the signal at the position of a3667 is free from cmb contamination .",
    "the northern extension of the central cold region could be due to such contamination .",
    "recent observations of a3667 by the multi - frequency arcminute cosmology bolometer array receiver ( acbar , runyan et al .",
    "2002 ) on viper should allow us to quantify the level of cmb contamination in the corona map because acbar has detectors sensitive to frequencies above and below the null ghz . at the cross over , or null , frequency",
    "there is no net change in cmb brightness temperature . ] in the thermal sze spectrum .",
    "it has been known for some time ( e.g. silk & white 1978 ; cavaliere , danese & zotti 1979 ) that a measurement of the thermal sze toward a cluster could result in a measurement of the hubble constant ( @xmath7 ) when it is combined with x - ray observations .",
    "this is because the the sze is proportional to the line of sight integral of @xmath36 , whereas the x - ray surface brightness is proportional to the line of sight integral of @xmath37 .",
    "these differing dependencies on the electron temperature and number density , allow one to solve for @xmath7 , assuming we can find an accurate model for the distribution of these parameters along the line of sight .",
    "we have used the a3667 data described above to constrain @xmath7 .",
    "we have performed a joint maximum likelihood ( section  [ subsec : max - likefit ] ) analysis of the corona and rosat pspc images . during this analysis we have generating many thousands of pairs of simulated rosat and corona a3667 images by making various assumptions concerning both the three dimensional distribution of electrons in the cluster and the performance and noise characteristics of the rosat pspc and viper corona instruments (   [ sec : sim - pspc ] and [ sec : sim - viper ] ) .",
    "the technique follows that used by other authors _ e.g. _ reese et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and grainge et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , but is the first application of the method to real space , rather than fourier space , analysis .",
    "the assumption underlying our analysis was that the number density of electrons in a3667 follows an isothermal @xmath8 , or king ( king 1962 ) , model .",
    "the @xmath8-model can be parameterized by :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the central electron number density ; @xmath40 is the radius from the center of the cluster ; and @xmath41 is the core radius ( cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1978 ) .",
    "the x - ray emission from a3667 is clearly not spherically symmetric ( figure  [ fig : sz1degree ] ) , so we have further assumed that the cluster has a tri - axial ellipsoidal geometry ( zaroubi et al .",
    "2001 have shown that the ellipsoidal @xmath8 model provides a good approximation to the three dimensional structure of simulated clusters ) .",
    "we define the radius in equation  [ eqn : beta - ne ] as follows :    @xmath42    where the @xmath43 , and @xmath44 directions are measured along the principle axes of the ellipsoid .",
    "the axes are defined so that @xmath45 and @xmath46 are in the plane of the sky and @xmath44 lies along the line of sight .",
    "there are two isomorphic sets of models , those with @xmath47 and those with @xmath48 . for the model fitting described below ( section  [ subsec : max - likefit ] ) , we used @xmath47 , _",
    "i.e. _ the ellipticity was given by the ratio of the minor to major axes .",
    "with this convention , the @xmath45 axis lies along the minor axis and the @xmath46 axis along the major axis .",
    "we have parameterized the stretch along the @xmath44 axis by @xmath49 .",
    "if @xmath50 , then @xmath51 , and the stretch along the @xmath44 axis is equal to that along the @xmath45 and the ellipsoid is described as prolate . if @xmath52 , then @xmath53 , and the stretch along the @xmath44 axis is equal to that along the @xmath46 axis and the ellipsoid is described as oblate .",
    "we have chosen to use the ellipsoidal @xmath8 model with @xmath54 for our analysis because , as shown by grainger ( 2001 ) , this particular model does not result in a significant bias in the measured @xmath7 value when applied to an ensemble of clusters taken from n - body simulations .",
    "the @xmath8 model is physically motivated ; it provides a reasonable , although not exact ( see sarazin 1988 ) , description of the radial dependence of the electron density in isolated spheres of isothermal gas in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "however , it does have several inadequacies .",
    "for example it predicts there will be a finite electron number density even at very large radii from the cluster center .",
    "it also includes an assumption of isothermality when certain clusters , including a3667 , are clearly not isothermal ( vikhlinin , markevitch & murray 2001a ) .",
    "moreover , many clusters , including a3667 , deviate from spatial symmetry .",
    "for these reasons , future analyzes of sze images would benefit from the use of non - parametric mdm - n - body simulations that have been constrained by observations rather than generic @xmath8 models .      for a cluster ,",
    "the x - ray surface brightness is proportional to the line of sight integral of the square of the electron number density .",
    "assuming @xmath55 follows equation  [ eqn : beta - ne ] , using infinite integration limits , and expressing surface brightness as a count rate , @xmath56 , one obtains ;    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the central surface brightness and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are related to @xmath41 in equation  [ eqn : beta - ne ] and to @xmath40 in equation  [ eqn : ellipse ] , respectively , as follows : @xmath61 and @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the angular diameter distance and @xmath64 is given by equation  [ eqn : ellipse ] when @xmath65 .    using equations  [ eqn : ellipse ] and [ eqn : xray - sb ] , we were able to construct simulated rosat pspc count rate maps of a3667 .",
    "the simulated pspc maps were generated in the same energy band ( 0.4 - 2.0 kev ) , with the same pixel size ( @xmath66 ) and with the same aim point ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) as the real observation ( section  [ sec : viper - data ] ) .",
    "however , rather than covering the full @xmath69 pixel area of the esas map , the simulated map covered only @xmath70 pixels ( roughly @xmath71 ) . the eight inputs to the rosat pspc simulation were as follows ;    * @xmath8 , @xmath59 and @xmath72 to define the shape of ellipsoidal @xmath8-model ; * @xmath73 to define the projected inclination angle of cluster .",
    "this was defined so that @xmath74 when the major axis points toward the west and @xmath75 when the major axis points toward the north ; * @xmath76 and @xmath77 to define the sky coordinate of the center of the simulated cluster .",
    "these parameters were free to vary and so the center of the simulated map did not necessary coincide with the geometric center of the map ; * @xmath78 to define the 0.4 - 2.0 kev rosat pspc count rate in a @xmath66 pixel located at ( @xmath76,@xmath77 ) . we note that this is the central count rate _ before _",
    "the correction for the instrument point spread function ( psf ) had been applied ( see below ) ; * @xmath79 to define a constant x - ray background in the same units as @xmath78 .    before embarking on a maximum likelihood analysis ,",
    "the simulated images had to be corrected for the effects of the pspc psf .",
    "this correction was complicated by the fact that the psf is a function of the radial distance from the center of the field of view . to account for the changing psf",
    ", we convolved each simulated image with 10 different smoothing kernels .",
    "each kernel corresponded to a model psf appropriate to a different , evenly spaced , radius from the aim point .",
    "the ten resulting convolved images were then co - added using the weighting scheme outlined in equation  [ eqn : weights ] .",
    "this method resulted in a dramatic computational speed - up , compared to a direct calculation of a convolution with a smoothly varying psf model , because it allowed us to use fast fourier transforms ( see appendix  [ app : point ] for more information ) .",
    "even so , it would have been computationally intensive to convolve the entire @xmath70 area of the simulated maps , so instead , we convolved only those pixels with a simulated count rate of least 2% of @xmath78 . the number of pixels meeting that criterion varied depending on the values of the input parameters , but typically only comprised those within a @xmath80 pixel radius of the center .",
    "this simplification was justified by the fact that cluster profiles vary slowly at large radii , meaning the shape of the psf has little impact on the per pixel count rate outside the cluster core .",
    "we numerically tested how much impact psf convolution has on the outer regions of the cluster model and found it to be insignificant . to create a final simulated image ,",
    "the center of the original @xmath70 pixel simulation was replaced by the circular convolved region .",
    "we note that the edges of the convolved region were cropped before insertion into the larger map in order to correct for the effects of the artificial periodic boundary condition imposed by the fft .      for every simulated rosat pspc x - ray count rate image , we generate a complementary simulated corona brightness temperature image . in the non - relativistic and low frequency limit",

    "the electron temperature enters the brightness temperature calculations via the the compton-@xmath84 parameter ( equation  [ eqn : compton - y ] ) and was assumed to be constant throughout the cluster .",

    "this is in contrast to higher redshift sze observations ; hughes & birkinshaw ( 1998 ) claim that by @xmath106 , current uncertainties in the underlying cosmological model result in a 10 - 20% systematic error in @xmath7 .    in summary , under the assumption that the electron number density follows a @xmath8 profile , the central density , @xmath39 ,",

    "@xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath95 , @xmath104 and @xmath98 were fixed during the model fitting .      after converting the simulated and observed count rate maps into units of counts per pixel using the esas exposure map ( section  [ sec : viper - data ] ) , we calculated the log likelihood of the simulated rosat pspc images using the following expression , under the assumption of poisson statistics    @xmath107    where @xmath108 is number of counts in the @xmath109 pixel of the simulated map and @xmath110 is the corresponding number of observed counts .",
    "we carried out the summation over almost all pixels within a @xmath111 square centered on the pspc aim point .",
    "the pixels we excluded from the sum had been flagged as belonging to foreground or background x - ray point sources ( see appendix  [ app : point ] ) .",
    "we also calculated the log likelihood function for the simulated corona images assuming gaussian noise using the following expression    @xmath112    where the vector , @xmath113 , is defined as @xmath114 ; @xmath115 is a vector containing the measured brightness temperature values ( @xmath116 ) in each of the pixels under test and @xmath117 is the corresponding vector of @xmath118 . in equation  [ eqn : logl - sz ] , @xmath119 is the covariance matrix that describes the correlation between the pixels under test .",
    "if the pixels were uncorrelated , then the covariance matrix would be populated by zeros except along the diagonal , where it would be populated by the variance in the corresponding pixel . in the case of the corona map ,",
    "the covariance matrix is more complex because the pixels are correlated via atmospheric noise , the finite response time of the detector and the linear interpolation used during the map making process . to evaluate @xmath119 we chose 28 pixels lying within one beam ( @xmath2 fwhm ) of the center of the co -",
    "added , but unsmoothed , corona map of a3667 .",
    "we note that we decided to analyze data from this region , rather than the from the whole corona map , because only near the center of the cluster did the sze signal exceed the background ( statistical plus cmb ) noise .",
    "also we wished to avoid regions overlapping with known radio sources . from the 1,518 individual raster images described above ( section  [ sec : viper - data ] )",
    ", we compiled a 28 by 1,518 matrix ( @xmath120 ) with a column for each of the chosen pixels and a row containing the corresponding brightness temperature measurement .",
    "assuming that for any given pixel , the 1,518 measurements were normally distributed , the covariance matrix for each row of @xmath120 was estimated as follows ; @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the transpose of @xmath120 and @xmath123 is the centering matrix .",
    "the latter is given by @xmath124 .",
    "here , @xmath125 is the identity matrix ; @xmath126 is a column vector of ones of length @xmath127 ( in this case @xmath128 ) ; and @xmath129 is the transpose of @xmath126 .",
    "since the 1,518 scans are independent and the errors are normally distributed , we can determine the covariance matrix for vector @xmath115 , @xmath119 , by dividing the covariance matrix for each row of d by the number of scans ; _ i.e _ @xmath130 .",
    "we note that the 28 pixels chosen for the analysis represented only a subset of the total number of pixels within the central beam .",
    "the pixels were selected in a checker board fashion , to avoid including any highly correlated nearest neighbor pairs in the analysis .",
    "the checkerboard selection method ensured that the covariance matrix was non - singular ( _ i.e. _ invertible ) without throwing away too much data .",
    "the joint log likelihood of the two simulated maps , @xmath131 , is given by the sum of the individual log likelihoods , _",
    "i.e. _    @xmath132    where @xmath133 and @xmath134 were defined above and @xmath135 and @xmath136 are the log likelihoods of the electron temperature , @xmath87 , and hydrogen column density , @xmath102 , values used to generate the simulated corona map .",
    "the latter parameters were treated differently to the other free parameters in our model because they have been measured by independent experiments . under the assumption of gaussian statistics ,",
    "their log likelihood functions are given by    @xmath137    @xmath138    where @xmath139 and @xmath140 are the simulation input values and @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 are the measured values and their corresponding 1 sigma errors . in our analysis",
    "we used @xmath145 kev ; @xmath146 kev ( markevitch , vikhlinin & murray 2001 ) and @xmath147 @xmath148 ; @xmath149 @xmath148 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "as described above , we were able to calculate a joint log likelihood for each pair of simulated a3667 maps using equation  [ eqn : jointl ] .",
    "the most likely ellipsoidal isothermal @xmath8-model for a3667 was that which maximized the joint likelihood . in order to find the most likely model we created several thousand pairs of simulated images , adjusting the 11 free input parameters ( @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath59 , @xmath8 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath7 , @xmath87 and @xmath102 ) slightly each time .",
    "the parameter adjustments were governed by the downhill simplex ( nelder and mead 1965 ) routine .",
    "we note that the first term ( @xmath150 ) in equation  [ eqn : logl - xray ] is independent of the model being tested , and therefore to speed up the calculations , was not evaluated during the @xmath151 maximization .",
    "the best fit values for nine of the eleven free parameters in the fit are given in table  [ tab : errors ] .",
    "the best fit values for the other two parameters , @xmath102 and @xmath87 , were identical ( to 3 significant figures ) to the values determined by independent experiments ( see above ) .",
    "the central electron density corresponding to our best fit model ( see equation  [ eqn : ktone ] ) is @xmath152 @xmath153 .    after the most likely @xmath8-model had been found , we used the likelihood ratio test ( lrt ) to define errors on the various input parameters in the fit .",
    "the application of the lrt to sze analysis has been described elsewhere ( _ e.g. _ hughes & birkinshaw 1998 ; reese et al . 2000 ) , but we review the salient points here . the variable @xmath154 has a minimum @xmath155 for the best fit model ( _ i.e. _ when @xmath156 is at a maximum ) . the cash statistic ( cash 1979 ) is defined as @xmath157 and is , therefore , equal to zero for the parameter set that defines the best fit model and greater than zero for any other set .",
    "the 68% confidence region for a particular input parameter can be estimated by finding the range of values that it can hold for which the cash statistic that is less than unity . when making the cash statistic calculations , we hold the parameter at a certain value and then carry out a likelihood maximization by varying the other parameters in the model .",
    "several values of the parameter need to be tested before the @xmath158 region can be determined .",
    "the traditional approach to the lrt involves measuring @xmath156 , and hence @xmath159 , at evenly spaced grid points in the n - dimensional parameter space .",
    "however , this approach is computationally prohibitive for a model with 11 parameters .",
    "we , therefore , devised a new lrt method which was both more efficient and more objective then the traditional method ( it is more objective because it requires no a priori knowledge of the parameter error distributions ) .",
    "our method proceeded as follows .",
    "first we did a rapid search to find values of the parameter under test that yielded cash statistic values greater than unity after marginalizing over the other 10 free parameters .",
    "we initiated this search by fixing the parameter at a point 50% above its best fit value .",
    "we then performed a likelihood maximization over the remaining 10 free parameters .",
    "we repeated this for a fixed point 50% below the best fit value . if these @xmath160 points did not yield @xmath161",
    ", then we repeatedly doubled the distance between the tested values until they did . in practice",
    ", we only had to use this doubling technique for the hubble constant ( _ i.e. _ all the other parameters had @xmath162 errors that were less than 50% ) . after finding two locations where @xmath161 , and knowing the location of the @xmath163 point , we estimated the locations of the @xmath164 points using a third order beta spline fit .",
    "the cash statistic was re - evaluated at the estimated @xmath164 crossing points and the spline fit performed again .",
    "the process was repeated two more times . in this way we built up at least nine @xmath165 measurements ; _ i.e. _ one at , four above and four below the best fit value . with at least nine inputs to the spline fit , it was possible to accurately determine of the @xmath164 crossing points .",
    "we performed the lrt error analysis for nine of the eleven and @xmath87 , error estimates were available from independent experiments , see section  [ subsec : max - likefit ] . ] free parameters in our model fit , see figure  [ fig : cashstats ] and table  [ tab : errors ] .",
    "in general the the errors were roughly quadratic , as expected for gaussian errors ; however , in the case of @xmath7 , the error distribution had a broad tail on the positive side . to demonstrate that the cash statistic was a smooth function of @xmath7 , we tested some additional @xmath7 values there were not selected by the root finding algorithm ( represented by the crosses on figure  [ fig : cashstats ] ) .",
    "our best fit value for the hubble constant is @xmath166 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 ( 68% confidence limits ) , see below for a discussion .",
    "best fit values for the other parameters can be found in table  [ tab : errors ] .",
    "for completeness , we list here published core radius and @xmath8 values derived from previous fits to the rosat pspc observation of a3667 : @xmath167 , @xmath168 ( mohr , mathiesen & evrard 1999 ) ; @xmath169 , @xmath170 ( neumann & arnuad ( 1999 ; model b ) ; @xmath171 , @xmath172 ( mason & myers 2000 ) . despite the fact that the previous fits were made to average surface brightness profiles , rather than to the image directly , the published values are generally consistent with those in table  [ tab : errors ] .",
    "the error on our @xmath7 measurement is primarily due to the statistical instrument noise in the corona map ; we have @xmath173 error on the measurement of the central temperature decrement and @xmath174 .",
    "other sources of random noise are less important because we have access to high quality x - ray data from rosat and chandra .",

    "as the first stage of the viper sunyaev - zeldovich survey ( vszs ) , we have presented a 40 ghz raster scan map of the region surrounding the @xmath1 cluster a3667 .",
    "the cluster was observed during the antarctic winter of 1999 using the corona instrument ( @xmath2 fwhm beam ) on the viper telescope at the south pole .",
    "the corona image of a3667 is one of the first sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) images of a low redshift cluster",
    ". currently , only the viper telescope and the cosmic background imager interferometer ( udomprasert , mason & readhead 2001 ) are able to make sze images of low redshift clusters .",
    "one of the advantages of low redshift observations of the sze is that complimentary data at other wavelengths , for example those necessary to make hubble constant estimates , are comparatively easy to obtain .",
    "the corona image of a3367 is also one of the first direct ( _ i.e. _ rather than interferometer ) sze images ; only two other clusters have published direct sze images .",
    "we have used the 40ghz map of a3667 in conjunction with a deep rosat pspc ( x - ray ) image to make a maximum likelihood fit to an isothermal tri - axial ellipsoidal @xmath8 model .",
    "we have determined 68% confidence regions for nine of the eleven free parameters in the model using a modified likelihood ratio test .",
    "our analysis method includes new approaches to point source detection in x - ray images with varying point spread functions and also to error estimation in multi - dimensional parameter space .",
    "these innovations will be applied during the analysis of other vszs clusters , but are also relevant to other sze experiments .",
    "our measurement of the hubble constant , @xmath183 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 , is in good agreement with previous , sze determined , measurements .",
    "the error on this measurement is large , but not atypical for single dish experiments , and is being driven by instrument noise in the corona map .",
    "other parameters in the fit have been determined to much higher precision ( 1 - 3% ) .",
    "the corona instrument was retired at the end of 2000 and replaced with the acbar instrument ( runyan et al .",
    "acbar offers both improved spatial resolution ( @xmath184 fwhm beam ) compared to corona and simultaneous multi - wavelength ( 150 , 220 , 280 ghz ) capabilities .",
    "using acbar , in combination with data from ctio , xmm - newton and chandra , we have continued the vszs and are working toward completion of the sze , x - ray and weak lensing observations of a complete , luminosity limited , sample of @xmath185 clusters .",
    "these observations will improve our @xmath7 measurement in several ways .",
    "first , long duration acbar observations produce more sensitive maps than was possible with corona ( see kuo et al .",
    "second , we can minimize the contribution of primary cmb anisotropies in our sze images by combining data at the three acbar observing frequencies ( gomez et al .",
    "this feature becomes important when the instrument noise gets down to the level of the cmb noise and it is noteworthy that most other sze experiments only operate at a single frequency ; diabolo ( pointecouteau 1999 , 2001 & 2002 ) , bolocam ( mauskopf et al",
    ". 2000b ) and suzie ( holzapfel 1997 a&b ) are exceptions , but these are not optimized to image low redshift clusters .",
    "third , combining observations of several clusters drawn from a statistically complete sample reduces both random errors and systematic errors associated with orientation bias ( _ e.g. _ grainger 2001 ) .",
    "finally , the improved spatial resolution of acbar over corona , means that we will be able to use independent beams to probe different lines of the sight through each cluster .",
    "we only used data from the central beam of the a3667 corona image for the analysis above , but by using multiple lines of sight we can reduce the error on the overall measurement . together",

    "if we define @xmath95 to be the ratio of electrons to protons substituting @xmath190 , we can rewrite equation  [ eqn : k ] as follows @xmath191 expressing the volume element as @xmath192 , we can rewrite equation  [ eqn : k2 ] in terms of an integral along the line of sight , @xmath193    where @xmath96 is a solid angle and where the distance along the line of sight is expressed as an angle ( @xmath194 ) .    if we assume that the electron number density follows an ellipsoidal @xmath8-model , we can write down an expression for @xmath195 , the raymond - smith model normalization at the center of the cluster as follows : at the projected cluster centroid the distance simplifies to @xmath196 ( since @xmath197 , see equation  [ eqn : ellipse ] ) . thus , along the line of sight intersecting the cluster center , the electron number density is given by    @xmath198    which is equivalent to the following if we express @xmath44 and @xmath41 as angles ; @xmath199    combining equations  [ eqn : k3 ] and [ eqn : ne02 ] , yields    @xmath200    which can be integrated using the following identity and substitution;@xmath201    as follows ;    @xmath202    we can determine the scaling between @xmath186 , the normalization of the raymond - smith model , and a rosat pspc count rate for a partcular set of input parameters ( @xmath87 , @xmath101 , @xmath100 and @xmath102 ) using xspec , see section  [ sec : ktone ] .",

    "we have devised a method based on mexican hat wavelet convolutions to identify point sources in x - ray images with variable point spread functions ( psfs ) .",
    "this method is able to exploit the speed of the fast fourier transform ( fft ) by approximating a smoothly varying psf with @xmath127 discrete smoothing kernels .",
    "this requires @xmath206 operations , where @xmath207 is the number of pixels in the image , compared to the @xmath208 operations required for the exact convolution .",
    "as @xmath127 approaches @xmath209 the method becomes exact , but , in practice , @xmath127 can be much less than @xmath209 .",
    "we have used this approximation both to find point sources in the rosat pspc image of a3667 , see below , and to create simulated pspc images , see section  [ sec : sim - pspc ] .",
    "our technique could equally well be applied to any pspc image and , after small modifications , it could also be used to analyze images from other x - ray detectors .",
    "the authors have applied it successfully to rosat hri and xmm images .",
    "the method we use to identify the point sources draws on the theoretical framework set up in damiani et al .",
    "( 1997 , d97 hereafter ) and has two parts : the selection of the optimum wavelets and the identification of sources .",
    "a brief summary is as follows .",
    "first the optimum mexican hat wavelets to extract point sources located at a set of @xmath127 radial distances from the center of the pspc fov are selected .",
    "the x - ray image under analysis is then convolved with each of these wavelets .",
    "next , a linear combination of the @xmath127 convolution products is generated .",
    "the resulting combined map approximates a map that has been generated by convolving the x - ray image with a smoothly varying kernel ( where that varying kernal describes the optimum wavelet at every position in the image ) .",
    "we note that the optimum wavelets are scaled so that when they are convolved with an x - ray image the result is in units of point source photon counts ( see d97 ) . for the analysis of the pspc observation of a3667 described above ( section  [ subsec : max - likefit ] )",
    ", we used @xmath210 different wavelets corresponding to 10 evenly spaced distances from the center of the pspc fov .",
    "where , @xmath212 is the so called scale parameter . using an optimization procedure",
    ", we can find the kernal best suited to find point sources at a particular radius , _",
    "i.e. _ the value of @xmath212 that maximizes the following expression :      where @xmath214 is the simulated point source image positioned at the center , @xmath215 , of a large array and @xmath216 is normalized so that @xmath217 .",
    "we carry out this optimization for a set of @xmath127 distances , @xmath218 , from the center of the pspc fov .",
    "for each of the chosen distances we maximize @xmath219 by varying @xmath212 using the nelder - mead downhill simplex algorithm and solve for @xmath220 , where @xmath221 .    to generate the simulated point source images , we used the empirically determined pspc psf model of hasinger et al .",
    "for any given point source , this model is a function of both its photon energy spectrum and its radial distance . for our analysis , we made the simplifying assumption that all point sources can be described by a generic absorbed agn spectrum ( @xmath222 @xmath148 , @xmath223 ) , since agn s comprise the majority of the rosat point source population ( mittaz et al .",
    "1999 ) .    after determining the optimal wavelet for a set of distances from the center of the pspc fov , we scaled the wavelets so that the magnitude of point source shaped objects was preserved in the convolution .",
    "the scaled mexican hat wavelet that we use is for each of our @xmath224 chosen distances is @xmath225    next , using fft s , we convolved the x - ray image under analysis with each of the @xmath127 optimum wavelets : @xmath226 where @xmath227 describes the x - ray photon count rate image .",
    "the convolved maps @xmath228 are then combined together : @xmath229 where the weights @xmath230 are defined as follows      and @xmath215 is the center of @xmath227 . by virtue of the wavelet",
    "scaling ( equation  [ eqn : scaling ] ) , the units of the combined map are such that if a point source was centered on position @xmath232 then @xmath233 would be an estimate of the photon count rate from that point source .",
    "this count rate can then be converted into an estimate of the number of photons collected from a point source , by multiplication with an appropriate exposure map ( @xmath234 ) .",
    "therefore , to excise point sources from an x - ray image , we can simply apply a photon count threshold to @xmath235 .    for the a3667 analysis described in section  [ subsec : max - likefit ] we excluded pixels above an 65 count threshold in @xmath235 from the maximum likelihood analysis .",
    "we also excluded pixels within a 4 pixels radius of @xmath236 count regions .",
    "we note that this 80 count threshold was chosen to meet the specific needs of the analysis described in section  [ subsec : max - likefit ] .",
    "a different type of analysis , a different cluster observation , or a different instrument would likely have led to a different choice ."
