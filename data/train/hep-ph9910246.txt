    "as is well - known , it is not possible to account for all three neutrino anomalies with just the three known neutrinos @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "if one or more of them can be explained in some other way , then no extra sterile neutrinos need be invoked .",
    "this is one motivation for exotic scenarios . in any case",
    "it is important to rule out all explanations other than oscillations in order to establish neutrino mixing and oscillations as the unique explanation for the three observed neutrino anomalies .",
    "i should mention that , in general , some ( but not all ) non - oscillatory explanations of the neutrino anomalies will involve non - zero neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "therefore , they tend to be neither elegant nor economical . but the main issue here is whether we can establish oscillations unequivocally and uniquely as the cause for the observed anomalies .",
    "i first summarize some of the exotic scenarios and then consider each anomaly in turn .",
    "there are three different ways that massless neutrinos may mix and even oscillate .",
    "these are as follows .",
    "\\1 . if flavor states are mixtures of massless as well massive states , then when they are produced in reactions with q - values smaller than the massive state ; the flavor states are massless but not orthogonal@xcite .",
    "for example , if @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 for @xmath6 to 3 but @xmath7 = 50 gev ; then `` @xmath8 '' produced in @xmath9-decay and `` @xmath10 '' produced in @xmath11-decay are massless but not orthogonal and @xmath12    on the other hand @xmath8 and @xmath10 produced in @xmath13 decay will be not massless and will be more nearly orthogonal .",
    "hence , the definition of flavor eigenstate is energy and reaction dependent and not fundamental .",
    "current limits@xcite on orthogonality of @xmath14 and @xmath15 make it impossible for this to play any role in the current neutrino anomalies .",
    "when flavor changing neutral currents as well as non - universal neutral current couplings of neutrinos exist , for example : @xmath16 such couplings arise in r - parity violating supersymmetric theories@xcite . in general",
    ", in these theories , one expects neutrino masses at some level here it is assumed that the fcnc provides the dominant effect . in this case",
    "the propagation of @xmath8 and @xmath15 in matter is described by the equation : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "there is a resonance at @xmath20 or @xmath21 and @xmath8 can convert to @xmath15 completely .",
    "this matter effect which effectively mixes flavors in absence of masses was first pointed out by wolfenstein in the same paper@xcite where matter effects were first discussed .",
    "the resonant conversion is just like in the conventional msw effect , except that there is no energy dependence and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are affected the same way .",
    "this possibility has been discussed in connection with both solar and atmospheric anomalies .",
    "( a ) flavor violating gravity wherein it is proposed that gravitational couplings of neutrinos are flavor non - diagonal@xcite and equivalence principle is violated . for example , @xmath24 and @xmath25 may couple to gravity with different strengths :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the gravitational potential",
    ". then if @xmath8 and @xmath10 are mixtures of @xmath24 and @xmath25 with a mixing angle @xmath28 , oscillations will occur with a flavor survival probability @xmath29 when @xmath27 is constant over the distance l and @xmath30 is the small deviation from universality of gravitational coupling . equivalence principle is also violated .",
    "\\(b ) another possibility is violation of lorentz invariance@xcite wherein all particles have their own maximum attainable velocities ( mav ) which are all different and in general also different from speed of light : then if @xmath24 and @xmath25 are mav eigenstates with mav s @xmath31 and @xmath32 and @xmath8 and @xmath10 are mixtures of @xmath24 and @xmath25 with mixing angle @xmath28 , the survival probability of a given flavor is @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "as far as neutrino oscillations are concerned , these two cases are identical in their dependence on le instead of l / e as in the conventional oscillations@xcite .",
    "neutrino decay@xcite implies a non - zero mass difference between two neutrino states and thus , in general , mixing as well .",
    "i will consider here only non - radiative decays .",
    "we assume a component of @xmath35 i.e. , @xmath25 , to be the only unstable state , with a rest - frame lifetime @xmath36 , and we assume two flavor mixing , for simplicity : @xmath37 with @xmath38 . from eq .",
    "( 2 ) with an unstable @xmath25 , the @xmath39 survival probability is @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 . since we are attempting to explain neutrino data without oscillations there are two appropriate limits of interest .",
    "one is when the @xmath43 is so large that the cosine term averages to 0 .",
    "then the survival probability becomes @xmath44 let this be called decay scenario a. the other possibility is when @xmath45 is so small that the cosine term is 1 , leading to a survival probability of @xmath46 corresponding to decay scenario b. decay models for both kinds of scenarios can be constructed ; although they require fine tuning and are not particularly elegant .",
    "in the lsnd experiment , what is observed is the following@xcite . in the decay at rest ( dar ) which is @xmath47",
    "which should give a pure @xmath8 signal , there is a flux of @xmath48 at a level of about @xmath49 of the @xmath50 .",
    "( there is a similar signal for @xmath51 accompanying @xmath52 in the decay in flight of @xmath53 . now",
    "this could be accounted for without oscillations@xcite provided that the conventional decay mode @xmath54 is accompanied by the rare mode @xmath55 at a level of branching fraction of @xmath49 . assuming x to be a single particle , what can x be ?",
    "it is straight forward to rule out x as being ( i ) @xmath10 ( too large a rate for muonium - antimuonium transition rate ) , ( ii ) @xmath8 ( too large a rate for fcnc decays of @xmath56 such as @xmath57 and ( iii ) @xmath15 ( too large a rate for fcnc decays of @xmath58 such as @xmath59 .",
    "the remaining possibilities for x are @xmath60 or @xmath61 .",
    "no simple models exist which lead to such decays .",
    "rather baroque models can be constructed which involve a large number of new particles@xcite .    experimental tests to distinguish this rare decay possibility from the conventional oscillation explanation are easy to state .",
    "in the rare decay case , the rate is constant and shows no dependence on l or e.    one can also ask whether the @xmath62 events seen in lsnd could have been caused by new physics at the detector ; for example a small rate for the `` forbidden '' reaction @xmath63 .",
    "this is ruled out , since a fractional rate of @xmath49 for this reaction , leads ( via crossing ) to a rate for the decay mode @xmath64 in excess of known bounds .",
    "oscillations of massless neutrinos via flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) and non universal neutral currents ( nunc ) in matter have been considered@xcite as explanation for the solar neutrino observations , most recently by babu , grossman and krastev@xcite .",
    "using the most recent data from homestake , sage , gallex and super - kamiokande , they find good fits with @xmath65 and @xmath66 or @xmath67 0.1 to 0.01 with @xmath68",
    ".    since the matter effect in this case is energy independent , the explanation for different suppression for @xmath69 , @xmath70 and pp neutrinos as inferred is interesting .",
    "the differing suppression arises from the fact the production region for each of these neutrinos differ in electron and nuclear densities .",
    "this solution resembles the large angle msw solution with the difference that the day - night effect is energy - independent .",
    "the massless neutrino oscillations described in eq.(6 ) also offer a possible solution to solar neutrino observations .",
    "there are three solutions .",
    "two are characterized by @xmath71 and @xmath72 ; these are analogs of the small angle msw and large angle msw solutions@xcite",
    ". these are now ruled out@xcite ( for both @xmath73 and @xmath74 by the recent nutev data@xcite .",
    "the third one at @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( the analog of the vacuum solution ) is the only one allowed@xcite .",
    "this possibility can be tested in long baseline experiments .",
    "the possibility of solar neutrinos decaying to explain the discrepancy is a very old suggestion@xcite .",
    "the most recent analysis of the current solar neutrino data finds that no good fit can be found : @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( e=10 mev ) @xmath79 to 27 sec .",
    "come closest@xcite .",
    "the fits become acceptable only if the suppression of the solar neutrinos is energy independent as proposed by several authors@xcite ( which is possible if the homestake data are excluded from the fit ) .",
    "the above conclusions are valid for both the decay scenarios a as well as b.",
    "the massless fcnc scenario has been recently considered for the atmospheric neutrinos by gonzales - garcia et al.@xcite with the matter effect supplied by the earth .",
    "good fits were found for the partially contained and multi - gev events with @xmath80 as well @xmath81 .",
    "the fit is poorer when higher energy events corresponding to up - coming muons are included@xcite .",
    "the expectations for future lbl experiments are quite distinctive : for minos , one expects @xmath82 and @xmath83 the story for massless neutrinos oscillating via violation of equivalence principle or lorentz invariance is very similar . assuming large @xmath84 mixing , and @xmath85 a good fit to the contained events can be obtained@xcite ; but as soon as multi - gev and thrugoing muon events are included , the fit is quite poor@xcite .",
    "turning to neutrino decay scenario a , it was found that it is possible to choose @xmath28 and @xmath86 to provide a good fit to the super - kamiokande l / e distributions of @xmath10 events and @xmath87 event ratio@xcite .",
    "the best - fit values of the two parameters are @xmath88 and @xmath89 where @xmath90 km is the diameter of the earth .",
    "this best - fit @xmath86 value corresponds to a rest - frame @xmath25 lifetime of @xmath91 however , it was then shown that the fit to the higher energy events in super - k ( especially the upcoming muons ) is quite poor@xcite .    in all these three cases , the reason that the inclusion of high energy upcoming muon events makes the fits poorer is very simple .",
    "the upcoming muons come from much higher energy @xmath92 and although there is some suppression , it is less than what is observed for lower energy events at the same l ( zenith angle ) .",
    "this is in accordance with expectations from conventional oscillations .",
    "the energy dependence in the above three scenarios is different and fails to account for the data . in the fcnc case",
    "there is no energy dependence and so the high energy @xmath92 should have been equally depleted , in the fv gravity ( or lorentz invariance violation ) at high energies the oscillations should average out to give uniform 50% suppression and in the decay a scenario due to time dilation the decay is suppressed and there is hardly any depletion of @xmath92 .",
    "turning to decay scenario b , consider the following possibility@xcite .",
    "the three weak coupling states @xmath93 ( where @xmath94 is a sterile neutrino ) may be related to the mass eigenstates @xmath95 by the approximate mixing matrix . @xmath96 and the decay is @xmath97 .",
    "the electron neutrino , which we identify with @xmath24 , can not mix very much with the other three because of the more stringent bounds on its couplings@xcite , and thus our preferred solution for solar neutrinos would be small angle matter oscillations .",
    "then the @xmath98 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is not related to the @xmath99 in the decay , and can be very small , say @xmath100 ( to ensure that oscillations play no role in the atmospheric neutrinos ) . in that case , the oscillating term is 1 and @xmath101 becomes @xmath102 this is identical to eq .",
    "( 13 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in order to compare the predictions of this model with the standard @xmath103 oscillation model , we have calculated with monte carlo methods the event rates for contained , semi - contained and upward - going ( passing and stopping ) muons in the super - k detector , in the absence of ` new physics ' , and modifying the muon neutrino flux according to the decay or oscillation probabilities discussed above .",
    "we have then compared our predictions with the superk data @xcite , calculating a @xmath104 to quantify the agreement ( or disagreement ) between data and calculations . in performing our fit ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) we do not take into account any systematic uncertainty , but we allow the absolute flux normalization to vary as a free parameter @xmath9 .",
    "the ` no new physics model ' gives a very poor fit to the data with @xmath105 for 34 d.o.f .",
    "( 35 bins and one free parameter , @xmath9 ) . for the standard @xmath103 oscillation scenario the best fit has @xmath106 ( 32 d.o.f . ) and the values of the relevant parameters are @xmath107  ev@xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the detailed fit performed by the superk collaboration @xcite giving us confidence that our simplified treatment of detector acceptances and systematic uncertainties is reasonable .",
    "the decay model of equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) above gives an equally good fit with a minimum @xmath111 ( 32 d.o.f . ) for the choice of parameters @xmath112 and normalization @xmath113 .    in fig .",
    "1 we compare the best fits of the two models considered ( oscillations and decay ) with the superk data . in the figure we show ( as data points with statistical error bars ) the ratios between the superk data and the monte carlo predictions calculated in the absence of oscillations or other form of ` new physics ' beyond the standard model . in the six panels we show separately the data on @xmath114-like and @xmath115-like events in the sub - gev and multi - gev samples , and on stopping and passing upward - going muon events .",
    "the solid ( dashed ) histograms correspond to the best fits for the decay model ( @xmath103 oscillations ) .",
    "one can see that the best fits of the two models are of comparable quality .",
    "the reason for the similarity of the results obtained in the two models can be understood by looking at fig .  2 , where we show the survival probability @xmath116 of muon neutrinos as a function of @xmath117 for the two models using the best fit parameters .",
    "in the case of the neutrino decay model ( thick curve ) the probability @xmath116 monotonically decreases from unity to an asymptotic value @xmath118 . in the case of oscillations",
    "the probability has a sinusoidal behaviour in @xmath117 .",
    "the two functional forms seem very different ; however , taking into account the resolution in @xmath117 , the two forms are hardly distinguishable .",
    "in fact , in the large @xmath117 region , the oscillations are averaged out and the survival probability there can be well approximated with 0.5 ( for maximal mixing ) . in the region of small @xmath117 both probabilities approach unity .",
    "in the region @xmath117 around 400  km / gev , where the probability for the neutrino oscillation model has the first minimum , the two curves are most easily distinguishable , at least in principle .    decay model    there are two decay possibilities that can be considered : ( a )  @xmath25 decays to @xmath119 which is dominantly @xmath94 with @xmath25 and @xmath120 mixtures of @xmath10 and @xmath15 , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mixing ] ) , and ( b )  @xmath25 decays into @xmath119 which is dominantly @xmath121 and @xmath25 and @xmath120 are mixtures of @xmath10 and @xmath94 . in both cases the decay interaction has to be of the form @xmath122 where @xmath123 is a majoron field that is dominantly iso - singlet ( this avoids any conflict with the invisible width of the @xmath56 ) .",
    "viable models for both the above cases can be constructed @xcite .",
    "however , case ( b ) needs additional iso - triplet light scalars which cause potential problems with big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , and there is some preliminary evidence from superk against @xmath10@xmath94 mixing @xcite .",
    "hence we only consider case ( a ) , i.e.  @xmath124 with @xmath125 , as implicit in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mixing ] ) . with this interaction ,",
    "the @xmath25 rest - lifetime is given by @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 . from the value of @xmath129  km / gev found in the fit and for @xmath130 ,",
    "we have @xmath131 combining this with the bound on @xmath132 from @xmath133 decays of @xmath134 @xcite we have @xmath135 even with a generous interpretation of the uncertainties in the fit , this @xmath45 implies a minimum mass difference in the range of about 25  ev .",
    "then @xmath25 and @xmath120 are nearly degenerate with masses @xmath136(25  ev ) and @xmath137 is relatively light .",
    "we assume that a similar coupling of @xmath120 to @xmath137 and j is somewhat weaker leading to a significantly longer lifetime for @xmath120 , and the instability of @xmath120 is irrelevant for the analysis of the atmospheric neutrino data .    for the atmospheric neutrinos in superk , two kinds of tests",
    "have been proposed to distinguish between @xmath10@xmath15 oscillations and @xmath10@xmath94 oscillations .",
    "one is based on the fact that matter effects are present for @xmath10@xmath94 oscillations@xcite but are nearly absent for @xmath10@xmath15 oscillations@xcite leading to differences in the zenith angle distributions due to matter effects on upgoing neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the other is the fact that the neutral current rate will be affected in @xmath10@xmath94 oscillations but not for @xmath10@xmath15 oscillations as can be measured in events with single @xmath138 s @xcite . in these tests",
    "our decay scenario will behave as a hybrid in that there is no matter effect but there is some effect in neutral current rates .",
    "long - baseline experiments    the survival probability of @xmath10 as a function of @xmath139 is given in eq .",
    "the conversion probability into @xmath15 is given by @xmath140 this result differs from @xmath141 and hence is different from @xmath10@xmath15 oscillations .",
    "furthermore , @xmath142 is not 1 but is given by @xmath143 and determines the amount by which the predicted neutral - current rates are affected compared to the no oscillations ( or the @xmath10@xmath15 oscillations ) case . in fig .",
    "3 we give the results for @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 for the decay model and compare them to the @xmath10@xmath15 oscillations , for both the k2k@xcite and minos@xcite ( or the corresponding european project@xcite ) long - baseline experiments , with the oscillation and decay parameters as determined in the fits above .",
    "the k2k experiment , already underway , has a low energy beam @xmath147  gev and a baseline @xmath148  km .",
    "the minos experiment will have 3 different beams , with average energies @xmath149 6 and 12 gev and a baseline @xmath150  km .",
    "the approximate @xmath117 ranges are thus 125250  km / gev for k2k and 50250  km / gev for minos .",
    "the comparisons in figure 3 show that the energy dependence of @xmath10 survival probability and the neutral current rate can both distinguish between the decay and the oscillation models .",
    "minos and the european project may also have @xmath58 detection capabilities that would allow additional tests .    big bang nucleosynthesis    the decay of @xmath25 is sufficiently fast that all the neutrinos ( @xmath151 ) and the majoron may be expected to equilibrate in the early universe before the primordial neutrinos decouple .",
    "when they achieve thermal equilibrium each majorana neutrino contributes @xmath152 and the majoron contributes @xmath153 @xcite , giving and effective number of light neutrinos @xmath154 at the time of big bang nucleosynthesis . from the observed primordial abundances of @xmath155he and @xmath156li , upper limits on @xmath157",
    "are inferred , but these depend on which data are used@xcite .",
    "conservatively , the upper limit to @xmath157 could extend up to 5.3 ( or even to 6 if @xmath158li is depleted in halo stars@xcite ) .",
    "cosmic neutrino fluxes",
    "since we expect both @xmath25 and @xmath120 to decay , neutrino beams from distant sources ( such as supernovae , active galactic nuclei and gamma - ray bursters ) should contain only @xmath8 and @xmath159 but no @xmath10 , @xmath160 , @xmath15 and @xmath121 .",
    "this is a very strong prediction of our decay scenario .",
    "we can compare the very different expectations for neutrino flavor mixes from very distant sources such as agn s or grb s .",
    "let us suppose that at the source the flux ratios are typical of a beam dump , a reasonable assumption : @xmath161 .",
    "then , for the conventional oscillation scenario , when all the @xmath45 s satisfy @xmath162 , it turns out curiously enough that for a wide variety of choices of neutrino mixing matrices , the final flavor mix is the same , namely : @xmath163 . in the case of the decay b scenario , as mentioned here , we have @xmath164 the two are quite distinct .",
    "techniques for determining these flavor mixes in future km3 neutrino telescopes have been proposed@xcite .",
    "reactor and accelerator limits    the @xmath8 is essentially decoupled from the decay state @xmath25 so the null observations from the chooz reactor are satisfied@xcite .",
    "the mixings of @xmath10 and @xmath15 with @xmath94 and @xmath8 are very small , so there is no conflict with stringent accelerator limits on flavor oscillations with large @xmath43  @xcite .    in summary , neutrino decay remains a viable alternative to neutrino oscillations as an explanation of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly .",
    "the model consists of two nearly degenerate mass eigenstates @xmath25 , @xmath120 with mass separation @xmath165  ev ) from another nearly degenerate pair @xmath24 , @xmath137 .",
    "the @xmath10 and @xmath15 flavors are approximately composed of @xmath25 and @xmath120 , with a mixing angle @xmath166 .",
    "the state @xmath25 is unstable , decaying to @xmath167 and a majoron with a lifetime @xmath168 sec .",
    "the electron neutrino @xmath8 and a sterile neutrino @xmath94 have negligible mixing with @xmath169 and are approximate mass eigenstates ( @xmath170 , with a small mixing angle @xmath171 and a @xmath172 to explain the solar neutrino anomaly .",
    "the states @xmath120 and @xmath137 are also unstable , but with @xmath120 lifetime somewhat longer and @xmath137 lifetime much longer than the @xmath25 lifetime .",
    "this decay scenario is difficult to distinguish from oscillations because of the smearing in both l and @xmath173 in atmospheric neutrino events .",
    "however , long - baseline experiments , where @xmath174 is fixed , should be able to establish whether the dependence of @xmath117 is exponential or sinusoidal . in our scenario",
    "only @xmath24 is stable .",
    "thus , neutrinos of supernovae or of extra galactic origin would be almost entirely @xmath8 .",
    "the contribution of the electron neutrinos and the majorons to the cosmological energy density @xmath175 is negligible and not relevant for large scale structure formation .",
    "another proposal for explaining the atmospheric neutrinos is based on decoherence of the @xmath92 in the flux@xcite .",
    "the idea is that @xmath92 are interacting and getting tagged before their arrival at the detector .",
    "the cause is unknown but could be a number of speculative possibilities such as a large neutrino background , new flavor sensitive interactions in an extra dimension , violation of quantum mechanics etc .",
    "the @xmath10 survival probability goes as : @xmath176\\ ] ] the super - kamiokande data can be fit by choosing @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "a detailed fit to all the data over the whole energy range has not been attempted yet .",
    "as i mentioned at the beginning , the main motivation for this exercise is to try to establish neutrino oscillations ( due to mass - mixing ) as the unique explanation of the observed anomalies .",
    "even if neutrinos have masses and do mix , the observed neutrino anomalies may not be due to oscillations but due to other exotic new physics .",
    "these possibilities are testable and should be ruled out by experiments .",
