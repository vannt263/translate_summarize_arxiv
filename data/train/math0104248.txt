    "intro this is a sequel to our earlier paper @xcite ; however , it can , and probably should , be read independently of that work .",
    "we first recall the main results of @xcite .",
    "let @xmath16 be the complex weyl algebra ; that is , @xmath16 is the associative algebra over @xmath17 generated by two elements @xmath18 and @xmath19 subject to the relation @xmath20=1\\,$ ] .",
    "let @xmath21 be the set of isomorphism classes of finitely generated torsion - free rank one right @xmath22-modules .",
    "since @xmath16 is noetherian , each right ideal of @xmath16 is a module of this kind ; conversely , because @xmath16 has a quotient ( skew ) field , it is easy to see that each such module @xmath23 is isomorphic to a right ideal of @xmath24 . for short",
    ", we shall often refer to a module @xmath23 as an `` ideal '' , even when we do not have in mind any particular embedding of @xmath23 in @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath26 be the automorphism group of @xmath25 ; there is a natural action of @xmath26 on @xmath27 .",
    "finally , for each @xmath28 , let @xmath29 be the space of equivalence classes ( modulo simultaneous conjugation ) of pairs @xmath30 of @xmath31 matrices over @xmath17 such that - \\i \\ \\mbox{has rank}\\ 1 \\,$ ] ; here we identify these spaces via the map @xmath32 .",
    "when @xmath33 , the space @xmath29 is supposed to be a point : as in ( [ i1 ] ) , we shall sometimes disregard this case . ] @xmath34 + \\i \\quad \\mbox{has rank}\\ 1 \\ .\\ ] ] for brevity , we shall often refer to a point of @xmath29 simply as a `` pair of matrices '' .",
    "there is a natural action of @xmath26 on each space @xmath35 ; it is obtained , roughly speaking , by thinking of the pairs @xmath30 as points dual to the coordinate functions @xmath18 and @xmath19 that generate @xmath25 ( see section  [ sect7 ] below for the precise definition ) . in @xcite we showed that this action is transitive .",
    "let @xmath36 be the ( disjoint ) union of the spaces @xmath35 .",
    "the main result of @xcite was the following    it1 there is a bijective map @xmath37 which is equivariant with respect to the action of @xmath38 .",
    "part of the significance of this theorem becomes clear if we think of the weyl algebra as a noncommutative deformation of the polynomial ring @xmath39\\,$ ] . in this case",
    "the analogue of theorem  [ it1 ] is elementary , because each isomorphism class of ideals has a unique representative as an ideal of finite codimension ; thus in the commutative case , the analogue of our space @xmath21 is the disjoint union of the point hilbert schemes @xmath40 of the affine plane . as is well known ( and almost tautological ) ,",
    "@xmath40 can be identified with the space of ( equivalence classes of ) pairs @xmath41 of _ commuting _",
    "@xmath42 matrices possessing a cyclic vector : to an ideal @xmath43 of finite codimension we assign the pair @xmath41 of maps on the quotient @xmath44/i \\,$ ] induced by multiplication by @xmath45 and @xmath46 . according to nakajima",
    "( see @xcite ) , our space @xmath29 can be obtained from @xmath40 by a deformation of complex structure . in commutative algebraic geometry",
    "it is a basic principle that a ( flat ) deformation of varieties should give rise to a deformation of any reasonable moduli space of bundles ( or coherent sheaves ) ; theorem  [ it1 ] suggests that this principle should extend also to noncommutative deformations .",
    "however , at the present time even the expression `` moduli space '' seems not to have any precise meaning in the noncommutative case ; our space @xmath27 , for example , does not to our knowledge possess any _ intrinsic _ algebraic structure , which is why we referred to it above simply as a set .",
    "the description of the map @xmath37 given in @xcite is not direct , but passes through a third space , the _ adelic grassmannian _ @xmath47 that parametrizes rational solutions of a certain integrable system ( the kp hierarchy ) . indeed , in @xcite we defined @xmath48 to be the composition of a bijection @xmath49 constructed in @xcite and a bijection @xmath50 constructed by cannings and holland in @xcite .",
    "theorem  [ it1 ] was then proved by following through what happens to the natural action of @xmath26 on @xmath21 under the bijections @xmath51 and @xmath52 , a tricky process , since the action of @xmath26 on @xmath47 is difficult to describe . in any case , although @xmath47 is an interesting object in its own right , it is hard not to feel that it is _ de trop _ in the question of classifying ideals of @xmath25 .",
    "another imperfection in @xcite is that there we gave no explicit description of the inverse map to @xmath53 ( cannings and holland do indeed explain what is the inverse of their bijection @xmath54 , but no description was known for the inverse of the map @xmath52 ) . for these ( and other ) reasons , we wish to rederive theorem  [ it1 ] in a way that makes no reference to @xmath55 .    to that end , we take up an idea of l.  le bruyn @xcite . if we think of @xmath16 as the ring of functions on a `` quantum affine plane '' @xmath56 , then an @xmath57-module @xmath23 ( in particular , an ideal ) is to be thought of as a vector bundle ( or coherent sheaf ) over @xmath56 .",
    "le bruyn s idea is to extend @xmath23 to a sheaf @xmath58 over the quantum _ projective _ plane @xmath59 , and then use a noncommutative version of barth s classification @xcite of bundles over @xmath60 to obtain algebraic invariants of @xmath61 . here",
    "@xmath62 is taken in the sense of m.  artin @xcite : following serre s classic paper @xcite , artin suggests to define a ( noncommutative ) projective variety via its homogeneous coordinate ring @xmath63 , so that a sheaf over such a variety is represented by a graded @xmath64-module ( modulo finite - dimensional modules ) .",
    "we give a quick sketch of this theory in section  [ sect2 ] below : readers who are not familiar with it may understand the rest of this introduction by analogy with the commutative case .",
    "the homogeneous coordinate ring of @xmath62 is the graded ring of `` noncommutative polynomials '' @xmath65 \\,$ ] , where the generators @xmath66 and @xmath67 all have degree @xmath7 , @xmath68 commutes with @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and @xmath71= z^2\\,$ ] .",
    "as for the classification of bundles over @xmath59 , le bruyn suggests to use the version of beilinson @xcite , which goes very smoothly in the noncommutative case ( cf .",
    "the following consequence of that theory is all that will concern us in this paper .",
    "suppose we have a sheaf @xmath72 over @xmath62 satisfying the vanishing conditions @xmath73 then @xmath72 is determined by the representation @xmath74   \\longrightarrow \\\\*[-1ex ] \\longrightarrow   \\end{array }   \\",
    "h^{1}(\\p , \\ms{f}(-1))\\    \\begin{array}{c } \\longrightarrow \\\\*[-1ex ]   \\longrightarrow \\\\*[-1ex ] \\longrightarrow   \\end{array } \\",
    "h^{1}(\\p , \\ms{f } ) \\ ] ] of the indicated quiver with @xmath75 vertices and @xmath76 arrows ( and relations reflecting the commutation relations of the algebra @xmath77 ) .",
    "in ( [ i3 ] ) it is understood that each set of @xmath75 arrows is given by multiplication by the generators @xmath78 , @xmath70 and @xmath67 of @xmath79 .",
    "it turns out that any - module of rank @xmath80 , which corresponds to @xmath81 below .",
    "] ideal of @xmath16 has extensions @xmath58 that satisfy ( [ i2 ] ) ; in particular , we shall see that the ( unique ) extension whose restriction to the line at infinity in @xmath62 is _ trivial _ always satisfies ( [ i2 ] ) .",
    "from now on , @xmath58 will denote this extension ( it is just at this point that we part company from l.  le bruyn , who chooses a different extension ) .",
    "then the three vector spaces @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 have dimensions @xmath85 for some @xmath86 . furthermore , multiplication by @xmath67 gives a surjection @xmath87 and an isomorphism @xmath88 . if we now identify @xmath89 ( say ) via this isomorphism , then @xmath69 and @xmath70 become endomorphisms of @xmath90 , and it is easy to see that they satisfy the relation ( [ i1 ] ) . in this way ,",
    "le bruyn s ( modified ) construction gives us a map @xmath91 .",
    "our aim is to prove    it2 the map @xmath92 is inverse to the map @xmath48 defined in @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we shall not attempt a direct proof of this theorem ; indeed , the machinery involved in the definitions of @xmath48 and @xmath92 is so different that this appears ( at first sight ) impossible",
    ". instead , we focus on the equivariance property of @xmath93 stated in theorem  [ it1 ] .",
    "because the action of @xmath26 on each space @xmath94 is transitive , the map @xmath95 is uniquely determined by equivariance once we know its effect on one point in each orbit @xmath96 .",
    "now , there is ( at least ) one point @xmath97 in each orbit for which it is possible to check directly that @xmath98 ; granting that , theorem  [ it2 ] is equivalent to    it3 the map @xmath99 described above is @xmath100-equivariant .",
    "one might think at first that theorem  [ it3 ] should follow easily from simple considerations of functoriality : however , the difficulty arises that an automorphism of the affine plane does not ( in general ) extend to a regular automorphism of the projective plane , but only to a birational automorphism . in algebraic terms",
    ", this means that an automorphism of the weyl algebra does not naturally induce any map on the graded ring @xmath101 , which is the only object we have to work with in the noncommutative case .",
    "our idea for dealing with this problem rests on a theorem of dixmier ( see @xcite ) , which states that the group @xmath26 is generated by the special automorphisms @xmath102 and @xmath103 defined by @xmath104 & & \\phi_{s,\\mu}(x ) = x + \\mu y^s \\",
    "\\quad   \\phi_{s,\\mu}(y ) = y\\ . \\end{array}\\ ] ] clearly , it is enough to prove that @xmath92 commutes with the action of these generators .",
    "we observe that @xmath102 and @xmath103 will be homogeneous if we assign to @xmath18 and @xmath19 the weights @xmath105 and @xmath106 ( respectively ) ; in geometrical language , this means that these automorphisms extend to ( biregular ) automorphisms of an appropriate _ weighted projective space_. slightly more generally , we shall work with the weighted projective spaces @xmath107 for any weight vector @xmath108 , where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are positive integers ( it does not simplify what follows to assume that one of them is equal to @xmath111 ) . by definition ,",
    "the homogeneous coordinate ring of @xmath107 is the graded algebra @xmath112 \\,$ ] , where @xmath113 have degrees @xmath114 , @xmath115 commutes with @xmath69 and @xmath116 , and we have the commutation relation @xmath117 = z^{|\\bs{w}|}\\,$ ] ( we set @xmath118 ) .",
    "it is not difficult to repeat all of le bruyn s considerations for any weight @xmath119 , the only difference being that the quiver that arises is more complicated than the one we saw in ( [ i3 ] ) .",
    "thus , each ideal @xmath23 extends to a sheaf @xmath120 over @xmath121 , and we obtain a pair of matrices , say @xmath122 , acting on the vector space @xmath123 . if we take @xmath124 ( or @xmath125 ) , then the automorphisms @xmath102 ( or @xmath126 ) extend to automorphisms of the graded ring @xmath127 , so we can follow their action on the corresponding pair of matrices @xmath122 by simple functorial considerations .",
    "theorem  [ it3 ] will therefore follow at once from the next theorem , which is perhaps to be considered the main result of this paper .",
    "it4 the pair of matrices @xmath128 corresponding to a given ideal of @xmath16 is independent of the choice of @xmath119 .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ it4 ] that we shall present here does not compare different weights directly , but instead compares each pair @xmath129 with yet another pair of matrices @xmath130 which we shall extract from an ideal @xmath23 in an elementary way ( that is , without the use of homological algebra ) .",
    "the construction imitates the elementary treatment in the commutative case , using the representative of finite codimension for an ideal .",
    "the weyl algebra has no ( non - trivial ) ideals of finite codimension .",
    "however , in section  [ sect5 ] below we shall construct for each @xmath97 two _ fractional _ ideals @xmath131 and @xmath132 ( both isomorphic to @xmath133 ) , together with embeddings @xmath134 and @xmath135 of @xmath131 and @xmath132 as linear subspaces of finite codimension in @xmath136 .",
    "of course , in that case @xmath134 and @xmath135 can not be @xmath22-module homomorphisms , but @xmath134 will be @xmath137$]-linear and @xmath135 will be @xmath138$]-linear . on the quotient spaces @xmath139 and @xmath140 we",
    "therefore have endomorphisms @xmath141 and @xmath142 ( respectively ) induced by multiplication by @xmath46 and @xmath143 .",
    "furthermore , we shall construct a _ canonical _ isomorphism @xmath144 . identifying @xmath145 and @xmath146 via @xmath147",
    ", we thus get a pair of matrices @xmath130 ( as usual , defined only up to simultaneous conjugation ) .",
    "it5 let @xmath23 be an ideal of @xmath24 , and for each positive weight vector @xmath148 let @xmath149 be the corresponding pair of endomorphisms of the vector space @xmath150 described earlier .",
    "then there are isomorphisms @xmath151 and @xmath152 taking @xmath153 to @xmath154 and @xmath155 to @xmath156 respectively , and making the diagram @xmath157 commutative .",
    "in other words , the various pairs of matrices @xmath158 and @xmath130 that we have assigned to an ideal @xmath23 all coincide .",
    "theorem  [ it4 ] is now clear , since the elementary construction of the pair @xmath130 does not involve any choice of weights .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ it5 ] consists of a calculation of @xmath159 using the ech cohomology developed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a key point is that the quantum `` planes '' @xmath107 have _ schematic dimension _ ( in the sense of @xcite ) equal to @xmath160 , not @xmath161 ; this means ( in geometrical language ) that @xmath107 can be covered by just two affine open sets , analogous to the @xmath162-plane and the @xmath163-plane in the commutative case .",
    "of course , in that case these two affine open sets fail to catch the point @xmath164 ; but apparently the quantum planes do not have `` points '' to cause that kind of trouble .",
    "it turns out that our pair @xmath165 of special representatives of an ideal is well adapted to calculating the ech cohomology of this @xmath166-set covering of @xmath121 . for details",
    "we refer to section  [ sect6 ] below .",
    "after this article appeared as a preprint , m. van den bergh succeeded in finding direct homological proofs of our main results : these proofs are presented in the appendix . in particular",
    ", van den bergh proves directly that our map @xmath99 is bijective , whereas in the main body of the paper we see that only after identifying @xmath99 with @xmath167 : this proof of bijectivity thus still depends on the arguments from the theory of integrable systems used in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that methods from integrable systems and from the theory of derived categories appear here as alternatives to each other ( cf .  the question raised in the first sentence of @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sect2 ]",
    "we give a brief introduction to noncommutative projective geometry , and summarize the results we need from the literature on that subject . in section  [ sect3 ]",
    "we introduce the main characters in our story , the weyl algebra , its various `` homogenizations '' and the associated projective planes @xmath168 .",
    "then in section  [ sect4 ] we show ( for arbitrary weights ) how to extract from a given ideal of @xmath16 the pairs of matrices @xmath169 .",
    "the next section explains the elementary construction of the pair of matrices @xmath130 , using the two special representatives of an ideal of @xmath25 .",
    "then section  [ sect6 ] gives the calculation of ech cohomology which identifies @xmath170 with @xmath171 , and hence proves theorems  [ it5 ] and  [ it4 ] .",
    "section  [ sect7 ] then deduces our other main results , filling in some details left vague in the sketch above .",
    "section  [ sect8 ] establishes beilinson s derived equivalence for the spaces @xmath168 : although , strictly speaking , this equivalence is not used in the main part of the paper , it is scarcely possible to understand the motivation for our construction without at least a cursory reading of this section .",
    "finally , section  [ sect9 ] discusses briefly the relationship of our construction to the original one of le bruyn , while section  [ sect10 ] explains how it fits in with the classification of bundles over @xmath62 given in the recent paper @xcite .",
    "we are indebted to l.  le bruyn and m.  kontsevich for advice in the early stages of the present work ; in particular , they both ( independently ) pointed out to us in october 1998 that a point of the space @xmath94 could be identified with a special kind of representation of the quiver in ( [ i3 ] ) .",
    "we thank m. van den bergh for kindly providing the appendix .",
    "the second author is grateful to the mathematics department of cornell university for hospitality during april 2001 .",
    "sect2    as we mentioned in the introduction , the starting point for noncommutative projective geometry is the following result of serre ( see @xcite ) : the category of coherent sheaves over a ( commutative ) projective variety @xmath69 is equivalent to a quotient of the category of finitely generated graded modules over the coordinate ring @xmath77 of @xmath78 .",
    "this latter category makes sense also for a noncommutative graded ring @xmath63 . in this section",
    "we give a brief overview of the theory of noncommutative projective schemes and their cohomology : we introduce the notation , recall definitions and collect some fundamental results needed for understanding the main part of the paper .",
    "our basic reference is @xcite .",
    "more details on graded algebras and modules can be found in @xcite , on abelian categories ( including serre quotients ) in @xcite and @xcite , on ( artin - schelter ) regular algebras in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the `` schematic '' structure on graded algebras and the noncommutative ech cohomology are introduced and discussed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . for a general overview of the subject we recommend the articles @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we recall that an associative algebra ) by ( capital ) boldface letters ( @xmath172 ) distiguishing them from ungraded ones ( @xmath173 ) . ] @xmath77 over a field @xmath174 is called _ graded _ ( more precisely , @xmath175-graded ) if @xmath176 as a @xmath177-vector space and @xmath178 for all @xmath179 .",
    "we shall assume that @xmath79 is ( both left and right ) noetherian .",
    "if @xmath180 for all @xmath181 and @xmath182 we say that @xmath77 is _",
    "connected_. it is easy to see that any graded connected noetherian @xmath177-algebra is _ locally finite _ , that is , @xmath183 for all @xmath184 .    a ( right ) @xmath64-module @xmath185 is _ graded _ if it has a vector space decomposition @xmath186 compatible with the @xmath187-grading on @xmath188 , that is , @xmath189 for all @xmath190",
    ". the category of all right graded modules over @xmath77 will be denoted by @xmath191 : the morphisms in @xmath191 are _ graded _ homomorphisms of degree zero .    for each @xmath192",
    "we introduce two functorial operations on graded modules    _ shift in grading : _ @xmath193 + _ ( left ) truncation : _",
    "@xmath194 $ ] we say that a graded module @xmath185 is _ left _",
    "( respectively , _ right _ ) _ bounded _",
    "if @xmath195 ( respectively , @xmath196 ) for some @xmath197 .    finitely generated graded modules form a full subcategory in @xmath198 ; it is denoted by @xmath199 .",
    "the shift and truncation functors on @xmath191 preserve this subcategory .",
    "moreover , if @xmath77 is left bounded ( for example , connected ) , so are all finitely generated graded modules over @xmath77 .",
    "further , if @xmath77 is locally finite , then every object in @xmath199 is locally finite as well .",
    "a few words on homological properties of graded modules .",
    "first of all , @xmath191 is an abelian @xmath177-linear category with enough projective and injective objects , so for each @xmath200 we may define the functors @xmath201 on @xmath202 as the right derived of @xmath203 .",
    "next , it is convenient to have some notation for _ graded _ ext - groups .",
    "thus , we set @xmath204 then @xmath205 for @xmath206 are the right derived functors of @xmath207 . to clarify this definition observe ( see @xcite , corollary  i.2.12 ) that @xmath208 at least when @xmath209 is finitely generated .",

    "finally , we mention the following natural isomorphisms ( of graded vector spaces ) : @xmath212 valid for all @xmath213 and for all @xmath214 .",
    "let @xmath77 be a noetherian connected graded @xmath177-algebra , and let @xmath185 be a graded right module over @xmath215 .",

    "the @xmath220orsion elements form a ( graded ) submodule in @xmath221 ; we denote it by @xmath222 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath223 is the sum of all finite dimensional ( over @xmath174 ) submodules of @xmath224 . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath185 is finitely generated , so is @xmath225 ( since we assume @xmath77 to be noetherian ) , and hence @xmath226 in that case .",
    "a module @xmath185 is called a _ @xmath220orsion module _ if @xmath227 , and _ @xmath220orsion - free _ if @xmath228 .",
    "the full subcategory of @xmath191 consisting of all @xmath220orsion modules will be denoted by @xmath229 .",
    "similarly , we shall write @xmath230 for the full subcategory of @xmath199 consisting of finitely generated @xmath220orsion modules . as we observed above ,",
    "the latter are precisely the graded modules which have finite dimension as vector spaces over @xmath174 .",
    "since both @xmath229 and @xmath231 are _ dense _ subcategories ( that is , in any short exact sequence @xmath232 the module @xmath233 is @xmath220orsion if and only if @xmath234 and @xmath235 are @xmath220orsion ) , we may introduce the quotient categories @xmath236 these are both abelian categories ( see @xcite , pp .",
    "367369 ) , the second being a full subcategory of the first ; they are equipped with the exact projection functor @xmath237 which sends all the @xmath220orsion objects in @xmath238 to zero and is universal ( among additive functors ) with respect to this property . throughout the paper",
    "we shall denote quotient objects by script letters ; for example , if @xmath239 , we write @xmath240 for the corresponding object in @xmath241 .",
    "the shift in grading @xmath242 preserves @xmath220orsion modules , hence carries over as an operation on quotient objects .",
    "the induced functor @xmath243 on @xmath244 ( or on @xmath245 ) is called the _",
    "twist functor_.    in general , the description of the morphisms in @xmath241 is somewhat complicated .",
    "however , if @xmath185 is finitely generated , we have simply @xmath246 where the system @xmath247 is directed by restriction of graded homomorphisms . it is easy to deduce from ( [ mor ] ) when two objects in @xmath245 are isomorphic , namely @xmath248 this perhaps explains the use of the word `` tails '' .",
    "if the algebra @xmath188 is commutative and generated by elements of degree one , then serre s result tells us that the categories @xmath249 and @xmath250 are equivalent to the categories of quasicoherent and coherent sheaves on the projective scheme @xmath251 . for psychological reasons ,",
    "it is very helpful to use similar language also in the noncommutative case , even though in that case we shall not attempt to give any independent meaning to `` @xmath252 '' .",

    "we outline the cohomology theory of coherent sheaves over noncommutative schemes , confining ourselves to results that will be used in the main body of the paper .",
