    "concerning neutrino physics , without double beta decay there will be no solution of the nature of the neutrino ( dirac or majorana particle ) and of the structure of the neutrino mass matrix . only investigation of @xmath0 oscillations _ and _  double beta decay together can lead to an absolute mass scale @xcite@xcite,@xcite .    concerning the search for cold dark matter , even a discovery of susy by lhc will not have proven that neutralinos form indeed the cold dark matter in the universe .",

    "the total @xmath2 neutrino flux has not been measured and also no real - time information is available for the latter .",
    "the genius project proposed in 1997 @xcite as the first third generation @xmath4 detector , could attack all of these problems with an unprecedented sensitivity . in this paper",
    "we shall concentrate on the neutrino physics and dark matter aspects .",
    "the further potential concerning susy , compositeness , leptoquarks , violation of lorentz invariance and equivalence principle , etc will only be mentioned briefly and we refer to @xcite .",
    "we shall , in section 2 , discuss the expectations for the observable of neutrinoless double beta decay , the effective neutrino mass @xmath5 , from the most recent @xmath0 oscillation experiments , which gives us the required sensitivity for future @xmath6 experiments . in section 3",
    "we shall discuss the present status and in section 4 the future potential of @xmath6 experiments .",
    "it will be shown , that if by exploiting the potential of @xmath6 decay to its ultimate experimental limit , it will be possible to test practically all neutrino mass scenarios allowed by the present neutrino oscillation experiments ( except for one , the hierarchical low solution ) .    in section 5 and 6",
    "we shall outline the potential of genius for dark matter search and for real - time detection of low - energy solar neutrinos .",

    "we can conclude an upper bound on the mass scale of the heaviest neutrino .",
    "for the lma solar solution we obtain from ( 7 ) @xmath46ev implying @xmath47ev . this first number is sharper than what has recently been deduced from single beta decay of tritium ( @xmath48  ev @xcite ) , and the second is sharper than the limit of @xmath49ev still compatible with most recent fits of cosmic microwave background radiation and large scale structure data ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the result has found a large resonance , and it has been shown that it excludes for example the small angle msw solution of the solar neutrino problem in degenerate scenarios , if neutrinos are considered as hot dark matter in the universe @xcite@xcite .",
    "figure [ dark3 ] shows that the present sensitivity probes cosmological models including hot dark matter already now on a level of future satellite experiments map and planck .    the heidelberg - moscow experiment , using the world s largest source strength , yields now since eight years already the by far sharpest limits worldwide .",

    "nemo - iii , originally aiming at a sensitivity of 0.1 ev , reduced their goals recently to @xmath54  ev ( see @xcite ) , ( which is more consistent with estimates given by @xcite ) , to be reached in 6 years from starting of running , foreseen for the year 2002 .",
    "to extend the present sensitivity of @xmath4 experiments below a limit of 0.1 ev , requires completely new experimental approaches , as discussed extensively in @xcite,@xcite@xcite .",

    "exo @xcite needs still very extensive research and development to probe the applicability of the proposed detection method .    in the genius project",
    "a reduction by a factor of more than 1000 down to a background level of 0.1 events / tonne y kev in the range of @xmath6 decay is reached by removing all material close to the detectors , and by using naked germanium detectors in a large tank of liquid nitrogen .",
    "it has been shown that the detectors show excellent performance under such conditions @xcite .",
    "for technical questions and extensive monte carlo simulations of the genius project for its application in double beta decay we refer to @xcite .",
    "genius will allow besides the major step in neutrino physics described above the access to a broad range of other beyond sm physics topics in the multi - tev range .",
    "already now @xmath4 decay probes the tev scale on which new physics should manifest itself ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . basing to a large extent on the theoretical work of the heidelberg group in the last five years , the heidelberg - moscow experiment yields results for susy models ( r - parity breaking , neutrino mass ) , leptoquarks ( leptoquarks - higgs coupling ) , compositeness , right - handed @xmath56 mass , nonconservation of lorentz invariance and equivalence principle , mass of a heavy left or righthanded neutrino , competitive to corresponding results from high - energy accelerators like tevatron and hera .",

    "already now the heidelberg - moscow experiment is the most sensitive dark matter experiment worldwide concerning the raw data @xcite .",
