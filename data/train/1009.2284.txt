    "the sources of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) still remain in veil , but the recent observation of the suppression in the energy spectrum of uhecr above the so - called greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff ( @xmath3 ) @xcite indicates that at least the uhecr with energies above the gzk cutoff come from relatively close ( within the gzk radius @xmath4 ) extragalactic sources . the magnitude and extension of the intergalactic magnetic fields are supposed not to be large enough to significantly alter the arrival directions of uhecr with these energies .",
    "thus , the distribution of arrival directions is correlated with the distribution of the sources and the arrival direction analysis for the uhecr with energies above the gzk cutoff can be very useful in identifying their sources .",
    "an important step toward this direction was initiated by the correlation between arrival directions of uhecr and nearby active galactic nuclei ( agn ) reported by the pierre auger observatory ( pao ) @xcite .",
    "though further analysis with more data weakened the significance of the correlation @xcite , it still remains as an important issue .",
    "another important clue for the uhecr sources may come from the study of the correlation between the uhecr arrival directions and the large scale structures manifested in the galaxy distribution or the matter distribution .",
    "it was studied by several groups @xcite and the results are not quite conclusive yet .",
    "the positive result will provide the basis for the further study of correlations between the uhecr and specific classes of astrophysical objects .    for the study of correlation between the arrival directions of uhecr and some astrophysical objects , we have to rely on the statistical methods .",
    "this is because the current limit of angular resolution in cr experiments and a poor understanding of the intergalactic magnetic fields make it difficult to pin down individual sources of uhecr from their arrival directions .",
    "this also seems to be unavoidable as we consider that currently the number of astrophysical objects which are candidates for uhecr sources is very large while the number of observed uhecr events is small yet .",
    "statistical studies of correlation between the arrival directions of uhecr and the astrophysical objects was done in many ways @xcite . in this paper , first we improve the previously used methods and combine them to obtain more reliable estimates of the significance of correlation .",
    "our improvement is twofold .",
    "firstly , while the previous analyses compared the _ representative values _ of the two - dimensional distributions of uhecr arrival directions , for example the number of uhecr events within the certain angular distance from the supposed sources , ours compares the _ one - dimensional distributions _ obtained from the two - dimensional distributions , which conveys more information in the sense that , compared with the above example of representative value , this one - dimensional distribution contains information about the number of uhecr events within any angular distance , not just within a certain specific angular distance . secondly , the previous analyses focused on the deviation from isotropy rather than the direct correlation with the supposed sources by taking as their null hypothesis that the uhecr arrival directions are isotropically distributed . here",
    ", we take as a null hypothesis the explicit source model for uhecr including the isotropic component and focus on the direct correlation of uhecr with the supposed sources .",
    "the basic idea is that we reduce the two - dimensional distribution of arrival directions to the one - dimensional distributions , which can be compared by using the well - known kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test .",
    "then , we apply these methods to examine the correlation between uhecr arrival directions and agn . for statistical test , we set up the simple agn model for the uhecr sources , in which all or a fraction of uhecr above a certain energy cutoff are originated from the agn within a certain distance cut . for simplicity , we assume that all selected agn have the equal luminosity and smearing angle of uhecr . the remaining fraction is filled with the isotropic component of uhecr to account for the contribution from the outside of the distance cut .",
    "we use the agn data listed in the 12th edition of vron - cetty and vron catalog @xcite and the uhecr data obtained by pao @xcite and akeno giant air shower array ( agasa ) @xcite to cover both the southern and northern hemispheres and compare the results drawn from them .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] ,",
    "we introduce three statistical methods for comparing two distributions of arrival directions . in section [ sec3 ]",
    ", we explain the simple agn model for the uhecr sources and the details needed for the generation of monte - carlo events for the model and the statistical comparison with the observed data .",
    "section [ sec4 ] presents the results of our analysis .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "we want to measure the correlation between the observed uhecr arrival directions and the directions of the candidate point sources to examine how plausible the candidate sources are .",
    "what we actually obtain through statistical analysis is the probability that the observed uhecr arrival direction distribution come from the expected uhecr arrival direction distribution from a given hypothesis about the sources .",
    "this comes from statistical comparison of two arrival direction distributions .",
    "quantifying how similar two distributions of objects on the sphere are is a non - trivial problem .",
    "various methods have been discussed @xcite . because the distribution on the sphere is two dimensional",
    ", we may apply the two - dimensional version of ks test @xcite .",
    "the drawback of naive two - dimensional ks test is that it does not properly care the rotational symmetry that the distribution on the sphere has @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the strategy that we reduce the two - dimensional distribution on the sphere to one - dimensional one for which the rotational symmetry is kept manifestly and apply the one - dimensional ks test to quantify the probability . for the reduction of the distribution on the sphere to one - dimensional distribution",
    ", we consider three ways described below .",
    "this is most useful when we consider the set of point sources for uhecr . by the correlation between two different sets of objects , we mean that nearby each object of one set , we can find objects of the other set at a certain level . to quantify the distance on the sphere , we use the angular distance @xmath5 between two objects on the sphere which is the angle between two unit vectors @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    "pointing two objects , that is , @xmath8 .",
    "for each object of the reference set , say the point source set , we count the number of objects of the other set , say the uhecr arrival direction set , within a certain angular distance @xmath5",
    ". then we sum up counts over all objects of the reference set and estimate the significance level of this number .",
    "this way of counting has been used previously in many literature @xcite .    to quantify the significance level of the correlation , we need to know the probability distribution of the expected number of objects .",
    "it can be calculated analytically or obtained by monte - carlo simulation , once a hypothesis about the uhecr sources is set up .",
    "the simple test bed is a hypothesis that the uhecr arrival directions are isotropically distributed .",
    "then the correlation between the set of sources and the set of uhecr arrival directions was claimed based on that we observe more count of uhecr than that expected in the simple isotropic distribution .",
    "but what this procedure actually proves is that the observed uhecr arrival directions are not isotropically distributed . to make a stronger claim than simply something more than isotropy we should use an elaborated hypothesis for the test .    the above idea can be slightly generalized to estimate the significance level of the correlation between two sets of objects on the sphere . instead of fixing the angular distance @xmath5 to a certain value , we consider the distribution of the count over the whole range of the angular distance , that is , from @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "we call it the correlational angular distance distribution ( cadd ) : @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the uhecr arrival directions , @xmath13 are the reference directions , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are total numbers of them , respectively . in fig .  [ cadd ] , we illustrate the basic idea and the usage of the cadd .",
    "we compare the cadd obtained from the reference set ( presumably the set of point sources ) and the observed uhecr arrival directions with that obtained from the same reference set and the simulated uhecr arrival directions from a given hypothesis . because two distributions to be compared are one - dimensional , the ks test can be applied to yield the probability that the observed distribution of arrival directions comes from the hypothesis .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it is very simple in practice and does not require arbitrary angular binning .",
    "listing in ascending order of all angular distances between pairs of objects in the reference set and the uhecr arrival direction set directly gives the cumulative probability distribution of the count number which is used in the ks test .",
    "since we directly deal with the cumulative probability distribution , binning in angular distance is unnecessary and the expected cumulative probability distribution from the hypothesis can be made accurate simply by increasing the number of simulated events enough .",

    "the expected flux value is the product of the uhecr flux expected from a given hypothesis for the sources and the exposure function at that direction .",
    "thereby , we call it the flux exposure value distribution ( fevd ) : @xmath16 where @xmath12 are the uhecr arrival directions , @xmath14 is the total numbers of uhecr , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the uhecr flux and the exposure function , respectively .",
    "it is also very simple in practice and does not require arbitrary angular binning .",
    "one additional merit of this method is that it can be used for the continuous source distribution .",
    "for the detailed motivations and merits of this method , see ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we take this method for checking and comparison .      the cadd and the fevd with the one - dimensional ks test respects the rotational symmetry .",
    "but they reduce a two - dimensional distribution on the sphere to one - dimensional distribution of angular distances and flux values .",
    "it means that the loss of information occurs .",
    "the one - dimensional ks test on the cadd catches the correlation of the source directions and the cr directions , but it can be faked by , say , the aggregation of uhecr themselves around a few point sources . to compensate for this , we may consider the distribution of the angular distances of all pairs of uhecr arrival directions , which we call the auto - angular distance distribution ( aadd ) : @xmath19 where @xmath12 are the uhecr arrival directions and @xmath14 is the total numbers of uhecr .",
    "it catches the aggregation or spreading of uhecr arrival directions .",
    "it was used previously to examine the clustering of cr arrival directions @xcite .",
    "the aadd method may not be so relevant for the correlation analysis because it does not measure the correlation directly .",
    "however , it is still useful to compare two distributions of arrival directions , and to test the hypothesis for the sources .",
    "it is quite useful when the number of sources is small or a few strong sources dominate over the others .",
    "for a statistical test , we need to know the expected distribution of uhecr arrival directions . to get the expected distribution from a given model for the uhecr sources , monte - carlo simulation is commonly used . in this section",
    ", we present some details needed for the generation of uhecr arrival directions by using monte - carlo simulation and statistical comparison with the observed data .      for statistical analysis of arrival directions ,",
    "we use the uhecr data reported by pao @xcite and by agasa @xcite .",
    "these data sets were selected with certain energy cuts .",
    "the energy cuts of the reported data sets are @xmath20 for the pao data set and @xmath21 for the agasa data set , respectively .",
    "the merits of taking a higher value of energy cut for uhecr data in the analysis of positional correlations with astrophysical objects are 1 ) we can minimize the deflection due to the galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields ; 2 ) we can reduce the diffuse isotropic components .",
    "the diffuse isotropic components may come from the contributions of our galaxy and far distant astrophysical object .",
    "we can reduce these contribution by taking the energy cut above the gzk cutoff , restricting possible sources within the gzk radius which is around @xmath22 .",
    "of course , the drawback is that we have a smaller number of data , which reduces the statistical power .",
    "so we need to compromise . here , we apply the energy cut @xmath23 for both data sets . with this energy cut",
    ", we have 27 uhecr events from pao and 23 uhecr events from agasa .",
    "these are shown in fig .",

    "the catalog includes a variety of contents of each object , for example , the equatorial coordinates , magnitude , color index , redshift factor and so on .",
    "the catalog may not be a complete list of agn we need .",
    "but we believe it covers enough number of agn so that the statistical analysis will yield the useful information .    because we apply the energy cut to uhecr data which is higher than the gzk cutoff ,",
    "most of probable sources of them are expected to lie within the gzk radius . with this fact in mind and for the comparison with refs .",
    "@xcite , we pick up the agn with the distance less than or equal to 100 mpc ( corresponding to the redshift @xmath42 ) for the correlation test .",
    "the original number of agn within 100 mpc in the vcv catalog is 694 .",
    "this includes 7 agn with zero redshift , which are problematic to be included in our analysis .",
    "thus , we eliminate these seven agn from our agn data set and the remaining 687 agn will be used in our analysis .",
    "we show their locations in fig .",

    "the uhecr luminosity would vary agn by agn in general .",
    "we now have a unified picture of agn as the supermassive black hole surrounded by accreting materials .",
    "it is also known that the efficient particle acceleration can take place in the vicinity of the black hole and in the jet up to energies above @xmath43 through several different mechanisms @xcite .",
    "however , it is still difficult to infer or to model the expected uhecr fluxes of all agn due to limited measurements done so far and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "thus , without a priori information , we assume that all agn have the equal uhecr luminosity . then , the uhecr flux from each agn is just inversely proportional to the square of the distance to it .",
    "we are considering agn as the point sources of uhecr .",
    "however , the trajectories of uhecr are bent by intervening magnetic fields .",
    "thus , the arrival directions of uhecr deviate from the exact agn positions .",
    "( we also need to consider the uncertainty coming from the limitation of the angular resolutions of detector arrays . ) to take this effect into account , we consider agn as the smeared sources of uhecr . the smearing effect also varies agn by agn as well as uhecr by uhecr .",
    "but , for simplicity , we assume that all agn are smeared sources having gaussian flux distribution about the locations with a common angular width @xmath44 , called the smearing angle . here , the smearing angle , @xmath44 , is taken to be a free parameter .",
    "semi - analytic analysis and numerical simulations of large scale structure formation indicated that the deflection of uhecr with @xmath45 is at best @xmath46 @xcite .",

    "the previous analysis of the correlation between agn and the arrival directions of uhecr done by pao group was based on the number of uhecr events correlated with agn , where ` correlated ' means that uhecr lie within a certain angular distance @xmath104 from agn @xcite .",
    "they used the data sets , agn with @xmath105 and uhecr with @xmath63 , and the angular distance @xmath106 which minimize the probability of the null hypothesis that the distribution of uhecr arrival directions is isotropic . under this condition , they found 20 out of 27 uhecr events are correlated with agn . the chance probability",
    "that this number occurs from the isotropic distribution is @xmath107 . instead of the correlated uhecr events , our methods compares the reduced one - dimensional distributions , cadd , aadd , and fevd of the observed uhecr events and the expected ones from the model , or the hypothesis . when applied to the same data sets , our methods yield the chance probabilities @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 from the isotropic distribution .",
    "these show that cadd is much better than fevd and aadd in revealing anisotropy of the pao data .",
    "the cadd method gives the result consistent with that of the pao group .",
    "the advantage of using cadd is that we can avoid the arbitrariness in tuning the size of @xmath104 to minimize the chance probability .",
    "even though the null hypothesis of isotropic distribution can be ruled out in these ways , it does not directly test the correlation between agn and uhecr .",
    "this fact was already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the direct test of correlation",
    ", we must set up an alternative hypothesis that agn are the sources of uhecr .",
    "the null hypothesis we adopted is rather simple - minded in that all agn listed in the catalog are treated as equal sources of uhecr .",
    "our test reveals that the hypothesis that all uhecr with @xmath63 observed by pao come from agn with @xmath105 is also ruled out by the chance probability of @xmath111 .",
    "it says that the observed uhecr are more correlated with agn than the simple isotropic distribution , but not sufficiently correlated with agn as required by that hypothesis .",
    "our result is consistent with that of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", we developed the statistical methods for comparing two sets of arrival directions of cosmic rays , in which the two - dimensional distribution of arrival directions is reduced to the one - dimensional distributions such as cadd , aadd , and fevd .",
    "then the probability that the observed arrival direction distribution comes from the given hypothesis can be calculated by the standard one - dimensional ks statistic .",
    "we applied three methods together in combination to the analysis of correlation between uhecr and agn to get improved and reliable conclusions .",
    "we used uhecr with energies above @xmath0 observed by pao and agasa , and agn within the distance @xmath1 listed in the 12th edition of vcv catalog .",
    "as our analysis showed , cadd is more useful than fevd and aadd in testing the anisotropy and the correlation with agn .",
    "we set up the simple agn model which assumes that all agn within a chosen distance cut are the equal sources of uhecr having the same uhecr luminosity and smearing angle . for the pao data ,",
    "our methods exclude both limits that the observed uhecr are simply isotropically distributed and that they are completely originated from the selected agn . however , we need to add the isotropic component to incorporate the contribution from the outside of the distance cut and the smearing effect due to the intergalactic magnetic fields .",
    "increasing isotropic component either through the background contribution or through the large smearing effect improves the situation greatly and makes the agn hypothesis for uhecr sources a viable one .",
    "but the required amount of the isotropic component is more than the estimated contribution from the outside of the distance cut .",
    "thus , the rather large smearing angle is needed .",
    "we also point out that restricting agn within the distance bin of @xmath2 happens to yield a good probability without appreciable isotropic component and large smearing effect .    for the agasa data",
    ", we do nt find any significant correlation with agn .",
    "thus , as for the agn hypothesis for the uhecr sources , we have quite different and even conflicting conclusions from pao and agasa experiments which mainly covers the southern sky and the northern sky , respectively .",
    "of course , we can not completely exclude the possibility that the observed correlation with agn for the pao data is just a mere chance .",
    "now , the northern sky is being covered by telescope array ( ta ) experiment .",
    "we hope the uhecr data from ta will resolve this problem .",
    "[ note added ] as this work is completed , pao released the new data of uhecr @xcite .",
