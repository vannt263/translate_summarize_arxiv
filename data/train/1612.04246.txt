    "the stochastic acceleration was first proposed and analyzed by @xcite as a mechanism for the acceleration of cosmic rays ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see details and references therein ) .",
    "the core of his idea , which we call here stochastic fermi energization ( sfe ) , had a larger impact on non - linear processes in general and has been the driving force behind all subsequent theories on charged particle energization in space and astrophysical plasmas . in the original treatment , relativistic particles",
    "were accelerated by encounters with very massive , slowly moving magnetic clouds ( scattering centers ) .",
    "fermi also dropped ( without any justification ) the stochastic energy change and kept only the systematic rate of energy gain , focusing on the interaction of scatterers with the high energy tail of protons .",
    "the rate of the systematic energy gain of the charged particles with the scatterers is proportional to the square of the ratio of the magnetic cloud speed ( @xmath2 ) to the speed of light ( @xmath3 ) , i.e.  @xmath4 .",
    "a few years after the initial article by fermi , @xcite and @xcite emphasized the stochastic nature of the initial fermi proposal and they estimated analytically the transport coefficients , using an idealised assumption for the interaction of the scatterers with the particles .",
    "@xcite assumed that the scattering centers are randomly moving hard spheres and applied their model to solar flares , for accelerating protons from the thermal distribution .",
    "the initial idea put forward by fermi was soon replaced in the astrophysical literature with a new suggestion based on the interaction of charged particles with a kolmogorov spectrum of * low amplitude * mhd waves @xmath5 and the acceleration process was renamed as * stochastic ( weak ) turbulent heating and acceleration * or simply * stochastic acceleration by turbulence ( sat ) * @xcite ; ( see also the reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when the amplitude of the waves @xmath6 is much smaller than the mean magnetic field @xmath7 , the transport coefficients for the sat are estimated with the use of the quasilinear approximation , and by solving the transport equations one can estimate the evolution of the energy distribution of the particles ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "so , the sfe was replaced in the recent years by sat , and the fokker - planck equation became the main tool for the analysis of the evolution of energy distributions of particles .    in the solar atmosphere , the formation of scatterers from traveling large scale alfvn wave packets , deformed by irregular magnetic fields inside a complex magnetic topology and driven by the turbulent convection zone and/or the photospheric motions , has been analysed by @xcite .",
    "they have shown that complicated magnetic geometry , typical to most astrophysical plasmas , greatly reduces the dissipation length , as compared to laminar fields .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the spontaneous formation of magnetic discontinuities inside a driven complex magnetic topology can cause explosive events ( nanoflares , microflares , flares and coronal mass ejections ( cme ) ) , which can become the source of torsional alfvn waves propagating along the mean magnetic field , developing increasingly complex structures when they propagate along the stochastic magnetic field lines .",
    "hence , the onset of flares of all scales arises in the strongly interwoven flux bundles and drives alfvn wave packets @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the energy stored in preflare coronal magnetic field can be rapidly converted and liberated by coronal magnetic field reconfiguration and relaxation during flares .",
    "the sudden reconfiguration will generate large scale wave pulses , which transport energy rapidly through the corona and the lower atmosphere .",
    "their analysis was restricted to laminar magnetic fields and simple magnetic loops , and excluded the formation of as and unstable current sheets ( ucs ) , which are expected if the large scale mhd waves propagate along complex field lines .",
    "the majority of the 3d mhd simulations of explosive solar energy release start with a simple magnetic topology which is forced away from equilibrium . during the eruption or shortly after",
    ", the magnetic field becomes complex and liberates large scale magnetic disturbances due to its rapid reconfiguration .",
    "the literature on this topic is vast , since the avenues for the explosive events are several , e.g.  stochastic shuffling ( braiding ) of the magnetic fields at the foot - points of loops @xcite , magnetic flux emergence @xcite , * loss of stability of coronal loops @xcite*. the important points to stress here are : ( 1 ) the explosive solar events are associated with complex magnetic topologies ; ( 2 ) the reconfiguration of the large scale magnetic topology , due to reconnection , will drive large scale mhd disturbances propagating inside the 3d unstable structure ; ( 3 ) the entire unstable magnetic topology will form as and ucs which participate in the heating and acceleration of the solar plasma trapped by this structure , as we will show in this article .    in this article , we pose three fundamental questions : ( 1 )  is the sat a good approximation for the sfe  ? ( 2 )  is the simple expression for the escape time , @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the characteristic size of the acceleration volume and @xmath10 the characteristic velocity of the accelerated particles ) , used extensively in the current literature , a valid approximation for the sfe  ? ( 3 )  how do trapped particles ( in closed or open simulation boxes ) evolve during the sfe  ?    in this study , we assume that coherent magnetic structures traveling with the alfvn speed ( * alfvnic scatterers * ) can be formed by the interaction of the large amplitude magnetic fluctuations propagating along the complex magnetic topology inside the solar atmosphere .",
    "their excitation can be either through the motion of the plasma inside the convection zone and/or the photosphere , by emerging flux , or by sudden energy release during large scale magnetic reconnection in the solar corona .",
    "we concentrate in this article on the interaction of the plasma with as .",
    "the interaction of electrons and ions with ucs was discussed briefly by @xcite .",
    "the outline of the present work is as follows : in the next section we recapitulate the main assumptions of the stochastic fermi type mechanism for particle acceleration and heating , and compare the main results with the stochastic weakly turbulent acceleration . in section  [ s : model ]",

    "they both exhibit a power - law shape for energies above , @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "the indices are thus very close to the ones of the power - laws in the open boundary case . we again use the estimated transport coefficients in the fp equation * ( eq .  [ diff2 ] , for @xmath161 ) , * solving it numerically as before , and the resulting energy distribution at final time is shown in fig .  [",

    "keeping the characteristic length of the acceleration volume constant , and varying the density of the scatterers in the range @xmath162 ( i.e.  @xmath163 ) , the acceleration time decreases from @xmath120 to @xmath164 with increasing @xmath128 , and the power - law tail index @xmath32 decreases from @xmath165 to @xmath166 .",
    "the saturation time for the @xmath32-index lies within and , so the quantitative behavior of the system depends indeed strongly on the mean free path of the interaction of the particles with the scatterers , @xmath1 .",
    "stochastic acceleration of electrons and ions by weak turbulence during solar flares has been discussed extensively in the astrophysical literature ( see the reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several questions on the stochastic acceleration by weak turbulence still remain open .",
    "let us mention a few here : ( a ) the term `` turbulence '' in these studies means `` a spectrum of mhd waves with low amplitude ( @xmath167 ) '' and the excited waves cover a specific range of wave numbers so that the resonant or transient acceleration of the particles by the waves can reach very high energies .",
    "the spectrum of the waves is assumed to be a power - law with specific slope .",
    "the excitation or the formation by non linear wave - wave interaction of the specific spectrum , with the characteristics outlined above , through an explosive energy release in a complex magnetic topology remains an open question .",
    "( b ) the transport coefficients are estimated with the use of the quasilinear approximation , which is valid only for weak turbulence .",
    "( c ) the escape time has never been quantitatively estimated , and it is used as a free parameter , calculated from the simple relation @xmath168 where @xmath9 is the characteristic size of the acceleration volume and @xmath10 the velocity of the energized particles . therefore , returning back to the three questions posed in the introduction , we conclude that : ( 1 ) the constraints posed for the validity of the theory of stochastic acceleration by turbulence are very severe , and its relation with the original concept proposed by fermi , the stochastic fermi energization , is questionable . ( 2 ) we have shown that the escape time , which follows closely the acceleration time @xmath57 in the asymptotic state of the interaction of particles with as , is an increasing function of the particle energy .",
    "this result is in agreement with recent observations @xcite , although with some caution , due to the relatively simple topology assumed by the authors in their analysis , which is contrary to the assumptions made in this article .",
    "( 3 ) based on the solution of the fokker planck equation and our numerical results , we have shown that when the transport coefficients are estimated properly the trapped particles sustain heating and acceleration of the plasma in a similar fashion with the non - trapped particles .    we have revisited in this article the initial proposal put forward by @xcite and re - introduced the concept of `` magnetic clouds '' as `` alfvnic scatterers '' , based on strong local magnetic fluctuations ( @xmath0 ) , formed at a small number of random places inside a complex magnetic topology and traveling with the alfvn speed .",
    "summing up the total energy carried by the random fluctuations ( @xmath169 ) and dividing by the energy carried by the ambient magnetic field @xmath52 , the weak turbulent approximation ( @xmath170 ) is still valid , but here now the energy is localized and carried by the moving coherent structures . as we have shown in this article ,",
    "the interaction of ions and electrons with the as is a relatively simple and , at the same time , a very efficient mechanism for their heating and acceleration .",
    "several aspects from our analysis can now be put in context in the energization of plasmas in the solar atmosphere during explosive events .",
    "the most important finding from our analysis is that the fast ( on a time scale of about @xmath171 ) heating and acceleration of the plasma particles depends on one parameter only , the mean free path of the particles interacting with the localized magnetic fluctuations @xmath172 the energy distribution of the electrons reaches an asymptotic form with temperature around and a power - law tail with index @xmath173 for @xmath174 .    based on the above findings , we propose a very simple , four step scenario for the heating of the plasma and the acceleration of particles during the explosive phenomena on the sun , which in our opinion solves a number of open questions that have been posed by current observations :    1 .",
    "step 1 : ( _ start of the magnetic instability and formation of unstable current sheets _ ) + the loss of equilibrium of large scale structures ( based , as we outlined in the introduction , on magnetic flux emergences from the convection zone , loss of stability of loops , the violent shuffling of magnetic field lines at the footpoints of closed loops ) will initiate a major reconstruction of the large scale magnetic topology and will cause the formation of unstable current sheets of all scales ( see fig .",
    "[ f : cartoonb ] , and * ? ? ?",
    "step 2 : ( _ large scale magnetic reconstruction and launch of a large scale mhd disturbance _ ) + the formation of complex magnetic topologies based on the violent reconstruction of the magnetic field during the launch of a magnetic disturbance on all scales due to the formation of ucs inside the unstable magnetic configuration ( see fig .",
    "[ f : cartoonb ] ) .",
    "steps 1 and 2 are following the scenario proposed by @xcite and are implemented numerically by @xcite , considering the deposition of energy in the low corona and upper chromosphere by large scale mhd disturbances during the collapse of a complex magnetic topology .",
    "3 .   step 3 : ( _ formation of as and ucs at random places inside the unstable magnetic topology _ ) the formation of as and ucs through the propagation of the large scale disturbances in the complex magnetic structures ( see fig .  [",
    "f : cartoona ] and fig .  5 in * ?",
    "step 4 : ( _ loop top , foot points and chromospheric heating _ ) the as and ucs formed in the closed magnetic topology ( fig .",
    "[ f : cartoona ] ) have @xmath175 at the loop top , where particles will be trapped , heated , and accelerated for relatively long times ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "more details for this process are presented in sec .",
    "[ periodic ] about the as .",
    "the interaction of the plasma with the ucs has been discussed briefly by @xcite .",
    "the mhd disturbance forming the as will reach the two foot points simultaneously and since @xmath1 is approximately the same at the footpoints and possibly smaller than at the loop top , the heating and the acceleration of particles will locally be more intense ( see sec .  [ open ] and fig .  [",
    "f : cartoonb ] ) and will compete favorably with the local coulomb collisions , as it already does at the loop - tops ( see sec .",
    "[ collisions ] and fig .",
    "[ f : cartoona ] )",
    ". it would be interesting to analyse the propagation of the magnetic disturbance into the chromosphere and to study if the local heating can be efficient when @xmath1 starts becoming comparable with the collisional mean free path ( see sec .",
    "[ collisions ] ) .",
    "the proposed scenario provides a way for the initial suggestions made by fermi to energize the solar plasma during explosive events without the need of a large number of particles to be transported from the coronal part of the unstable structure to the low corona and the upper chromosphere .",
    "we developed a 3d lattice model where a small fraction of grid - points acts as `` scatterers '' , in accordance with the initial suggestion of @xcite and the work of @xcite and @xcite . in our work ,",
    "the emphasis is put on the coherent local fluctuations inside a complex magnetic topology , which are moving with the alfvn speed , and which we here refer to as `` alfvnic scatterers '' ( as ) , and the initial fermi approach is called stochastic fermi energization ( sfe ) .",
    "* the stochastic fermi energization ( sfe ) can reproduce the well known energy distribution of astrophysical plasmas , where heating of the bulk and acceleration of the energetic particles co - exist . * the density of the scatterers ( or equivalently , the mean free path @xmath1 of the interaction of the particles with the as ) controls the heating and the evolution of the energetic particles . *",
    "the energy distribution reaches an asymptotic state on a time scale comparable to the acceleration time @xmath57 .",
    "similar results have been reported on the interaction of ions with a spectrum of alfvn waves or electrons with a spectrum of whistler waves ( see * ? ? ?",
    "when the energy distribution reaches the asymptotic state , the mean escape time of the particles @xmath24 is comparable with @xmath57 * if @xmath176 * * the index of the power - law of the particles in the energetic tail in the asymptotic state seems to agree very well with the simple formula derived by fermi , @xmath177 and with the estimates of @xcite and @xcite for @xmath178 * the escape time has a power - law dependence on the energy of the particles , @xmath179 , which is different from the relation used in the analysis of the stochastic acceleration by waves , and it agrees qualitatively with observations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "yet , a more careful modeling is needed , both for the long trapping of the hard x - rays in the high corona @xcite and for the results reported by @xcite . *",
    "the transport coefficients are estimated from the dynamics of the particles interacting with the as ; the systematic acceleration coefficient has the form @xmath180 and the diffusion coefficient the form @xmath181 , where @xmath182 and @xmath183 , quite close to the values predicted in the hard sphere approximation of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the solution of the fokker - planck equation conforms well with the energy distribution derived from our numerical simulation of the dynamic evolution of the particles , in the low and up to mildly - relativistic energy regimes .",
    "* collisions slow down the low energy electrons and ions and do not influence the power - law index in the asymptotic state . * the trapped particles ( periodic boundary conditions )",
    "are energized much more efficiently than the particles in the open system .",
    "for this reason , we have used a longer mean free path , and the system reaches the asymptotic state on a longer time scale and the energy distribution of the energetic particles has a softer power - law index .",
    "the overall characteristics of the energy distribution are similar to the results reported for the open box .",
    "the transport coefficients were again estimated from the trajectories of the particles , and the solution of the fokker - planck equation agrees with the energy distribution estimated from the simulation of the dynamic evolution of the particles .    in summary , the formation of large scale * local * magnetic fluctuation @xmath184 inside complex magnetic topologies during explosive phenomena forced us to reconsider the original sfe process .",
    "we note that the sfe process has only one free parameter , the mean free path @xmath185    many question remain open and will be discussed in future publications .",
    "for example , what will happen to the system analyzed here if the sa are replaced by ucs ( see * ? ? ? * )  ?",
    "what will happen to a beam of particles interacting with the sa and being re - accelerated as they propagate inside the complex magnetic topology  ?",
    "what will happen at a strong shock if the as and ucs upstream and downstream of the shock surface are treated with the tools reported in this study  ?",
