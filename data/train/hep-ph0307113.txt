    "the calculation of radiative corrections in the electroweak standard model ( sm ) is especially demanding because of the many species of particles and fields and the large variety of interactions between them as well as the many mass and energy scales which typically show up in a high energy scattering process .",
    "practical problems in the calculation and numerical evaluation of feynman integrals were encountered at an early stage of sm calculations beyond the tree level , at the level of the one  loop integrals already . to a large extent , known analytic results and techniques have been reviewed , extended and discussed long time ago in  @xcite .",
    "in addition m. veltman first had the idea to develop a library of numerical routines , the program formf  @xcite , which allowed to calculate the one  loop radiative corrections for @xmath13 scattering processes in a numerically stable way .",
    "unfortunately , this program was only running in cdc assembler , and used very high precision ( more than 100 digits ) to overcome the numerical instabilities that plagues the calculation of one - loop electroweak radiative correction .",
    "later g.j .",
    "van oldenborgh implemented the most relevant one  loop integrals as a normal fortran library ff  @xcite , which utilizes alternative algorithms which run in double precision fortran 77 .",
    "this program was very useful for many of the calculations which were needed for precision physics at lep .",
    "meanwhile a number of extensions to two and more  loops have been developed .",
    "for example , the programs shell2  @xcite and mincer  @xcite allow to calculate special types of integrals .",
    "more recently we face new problems in view of the requirements for future colliders .",
    "for example , we certainly will need full electroweak two  loop calculations for @xmath14 fermion processes as well as full one  loop @xmath15 fermion processes for precision physics at a future @xmath16 linear collider like tesla . in both cases the existing program libraries need important extensions .    in the first case , for the renormalization of two and more loops ,",
    "one needs one  loop integrals to higher order in the @xmath17expansion ( @xmath18 ) , while in the second case efficient algorithms are needed for the calculation of @xmath19 , @xmath20 and higher point functions , which at least on the level of the scalar integrals are ultraviolet finite in @xmath21 dimensions .",
    "usually , one may reduce them to a sum of @xmath3 and lower  point functions , however with `` unphysical '' external kinematics .",
    "while ff serves all requirements to calculate @xmath22 processes at one  loop , it does not work in general if we try to evaluate the expressions we obtain as a result from the reduction of higher point functions and we thus have to extend this tool appropriately .",
    "another important extension we need stems from the fact that unstable particles , like the massive gauge bosons @xmath23 , @xmath24 , the higgs and the top quark , show up as intermediate states in scattering matrix elements .",
    "most interesting is their production near resonance , where ordinary perturbation theory breaks down and requires to work with finite width propagators not only for single resonant virtual particle lines but also within loops .",
    "most obviously this shows up in the interplay between virtual and real photon emission in infrared sensitive quantities .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new method to deal with one  loop integrals which allows for extensions in several respects .",
    "the algorithm we propose works for arbitrary space ",
    "time dimensions , for complex masses and momenta and allows to find the appropriate physical domain of the analytic structure .",

    ", we give explicit representations : in sect .",
    "4 for the @xmath4point function , where also the approach itself is demonstrated in great detail ; similarly in sect . 5 for the @xmath6point function and in sect.6 for the @xmath3point function .",
    "explicit examples needed in bhabha scattering are also presented .",
    "for the boundary term of a @xmath3point bhabha diagram a differential equation is set up as alternative method for its determination .",
    "relations between feynman integrals in different dimensions are known since quite a long time @xcite .",
