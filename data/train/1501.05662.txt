    "we also note that the two generalized dimensions above have been shown   @xcite to be related through the expression @xmath22 .",
    "a natural question following this brief summary of the anderson localization is what happens to the above findings when interaction is included .",

    "studies about many - body localization ( mbl ) have recently boomed  @xcite .",

    "the value of @xmath36 at which level repulsion becomes evident decreases as the system size increases . in parallel , the level of delocalization of the eigenstates in real space increases substantially .",
