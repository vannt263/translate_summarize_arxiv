    "one - time pad ( otp ) encryption provides information - theoretically secure message transmission @xcite , but key distribution is its achilles heel .",
    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) permits remote parties ( alice and bob ) to share a random bit string  the key needed for otp encryption  with security vouchsafed by quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the demonstrated secret - key rates of long - distance qkd systems fall far short of the gbps rates needed for otp encryption of large data files , as seen from the following state - of - the - art achievements . in discrete - variable qkd ( dv - qkd ) ,",
    "the best result to date is lucamarini _ et al .",
    "_ s decoy state bennett - brassard 1984 ( bb84 ) system , which used a 1gbps source rate but only realized a 1mbps secret - key rate over a 50-km - long fiber @xcite . in continuous - variable qkd ( cv - qkd ) , the best result to date is from huang _",
    "et al . _ , who reported a 1mbps secret - key rate at 25 km path length using a 50mbaud source rate @xcite , with 90kbps expected at 50 km in the asymptotic ( infinite block - length ) regime .    focusing , for the moment , on dv - qkd systems  owing to their greater demonstrated capability over long distances ",
    "it is easy to identify why gbps rates are beyond their state - of - the - art grasp : they transmit no more than @xmath01photon / bit .",
    "one justification for this self - imposed limit is that these systems must defeat the undetectable passive eavesdropper .",
    "qkd security analyses afford the eavesdropper ( eve ) all things consistent with the laws of physics .",
    "in particular , a passive eve could replace the transmissivity @xmath1 optical fiber connecting alice and bob with a lossless long - distance coupler that allows her to capture and measure a fraction @xmath2 of alice s transmitted light while routing the remaining fraction @xmath3 to bob without disturbance . with no disturbance of the light that bob receives",
    ", eve does not create the telltale errors that reveal her eavesdropping . in principle",
    ", such a coupler could be constructed to mimic  insofar as alice and bob are concerned  the propagation characteristics of the fiber that it replaced .",
    "thus alice and bob could not detect eve s presence via channel monitoring , e.g. , with an optical time - domain reflectometer .",
    "so , were alice to ignore the potential presence of the undetectable passive eavesdropper and make a many - photons - per - bit bb84 transmission to bob through this lossy quantum channel , then eve could easily obtain a near - perfect measurement of _ all _ of alice s bits .",
    "we regard secret - key rate , in bits per second , as qkd systems preeminent figure of merit : unless gbps rates over metropolitan - area spans can be realized , otp - encrypted transmission of large data files will not reach widespread usage .",
    "existing qkd systems operating over long  distance connections _ might _ be pushed to gbps secret - key rates , but doing so would require impractically large amounts of wavelength - division multiplexing ( wdm ) .",
    "consider scaling lucamarini _",
    "et al_. s bb84 system @xcite to a 10gbps source rate achieving a 10mbps secret - key rate over a 50 km fiber link .",
    "that system would require 100 wdm channels to yield a 1gbps secret - key rate  while 1000 such channels would be needed at the original source rate ",
    "each with its own single - photon detection setup . a similar scaling of huang _ et al_. s cv - qkd system @xcite  to a 10gbaud source rate that achieves 18mbps secret - key rate over a 50 km fiber link in the asymptotic regime  implies that more than 50 wdm channels would be needed to obtain a 1gbps secret - key rate .",
    "in this paper we introduce floodlight quantum key distribution ( fl - qkd ) , and show that it offers a practical route to gbps secret - key rates over metropolitan - area distances with security against the optimum frequency - domain collective attack and without the need for multiplexing . how does fl - qkd realize this extraordinary secret - key rate ? it derives from fl - qkd s secret - key efficiency , in bits per channel use , being two order of magnitude higher than those of state - of - the - art systems .",
    "in particular , fl - qkd floods the alice - to - bob channel with broadband light  whose bandwidth is much greater than the modulation rate  containing many photons per bit .",
    "its immunity to the undetectable passive - eavesdropping attack then comes from that high number of transmitted photons per bit being distributed over a much greater number of optical modes to make that transmission have low brightness , i.e. , less than one photon per mode .",
    "fl - qkd also employs photon - coincidence channel monitoring on the alice - to - bob channel , to ensure security against the active component of a frequency - domain collective attack , in which eve can inject her own light into bob s terminal and tries to obtain his bit string from the modulated version of that light which is contained in what she taps from the bob - to - alice channel . more importantly , we show that fl - qkd can support a 2gbps secret - key rate over a 50-km - long fiber link against the optimum frequency - domain collective attack , and that it can be implemented with available equipment , i.e. , no new technology need be developed .",
    "in short , fl - qkd opens the possibility for otp encryption of large data files for secure transmission over metropolitan - area distances at gbps rates .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "sections  ii through v present , in succession , a description of the fl - qkd protocol , its security analysis , its secret - key rate behavior , and some concluding discussion . for the sake of readability",
    ", we have relegated all detailed analysis to a series of appendices .",
    "figure  [ setup ] shows fl - qkd s quantum channel setup in the presence of a frequency - domain collective attack .",
    "alice and bob use this setup to generate their raw key and to bound eve s holevo information .",
    "not shown in this figure is the tamper - proof classical channel that alice and bob use for reconciliation .",
    "neither that procedure nor fl - qkd s subsequent privacy amplification step will be described herein , because they are merely higher rate versions of standard practice in qkd .    quantum channel setup for fl - qkd under frequency - domain collective attack .",
    "ase : amplified spontaneous emission source .",
    "spdc : spontaneous parametric downconverter .",
    "bpsk : binary phase - shift keying .",
    "lo : local oscillator.,width=312 ]    raw key generation in fl - qkd occurs as follows .",
    "alice sends unmodulated , continuous - wave ( cw ) light over optical fiber to bob , who imposes a random bit string on that light by means of binary phase - shift keying ( bpsk ) at @xmath4 bps , amplifies the modulated light ( to overcome return - path loss ) , and returns it to alice over optical fiber .",
    "fl - qkd s security against a frequency - domain collective attack , and its high secret - key rate , come from the composite nature of alice s source plus the data that alice and bob obtain from their channel monitors , which are used to ensure the integrity of the alice - to - bob channel , i.e , the near - perfect correlation between the light reaching bob and the reference retained by alice .",
    "so , to complete our protocol description , we will characterize alice s source and alice and bob s channel monitors .",
    "alice uses an optical amplifier to produce a high - brightness ( @xmath5 photon s@xmath6hz@xmath6 ) single spatial - mode beam of amplified spontaneous emission ( ase ) noise with a @xmath7-hz - bandwidth flat spectrum .",
    "she uses a cw spontaneous parametric downconverter ( spdc ) to produce quadrature - entangled , single spatial - mode signal and idler beams that have bandwidth @xmath7 flat spectra , with the former having the same center frequency as her ase source .",
    "alice directs the idler beam to a single - photon detector that is part of her channel monitor .",
    "she uses a beam combiner to merge a low - brightness ( @xmath8 photon s@xmath6hz@xmath6 ) portion of her ase light with her spdc s signal light resulting in an @xmath9:1 ase - to - spdc - ratio output with @xmath10 .",
    "she sends a small fraction of her combined ase - spdc light to another single - photon detector ( also part of her channel monitor ) , and transmits the remaining portion of her ase - spdc light to bob .",
    "alice stores the high - brightness portion of her initial ase light in an optical delay - line fiber ( whose delay matches that of the alice - to - bob - to - alice roundtrip ) for use as the local oscillator ( lo ) in a broadband homodyne receiver .",
    "she employs optical amplification , as needed , so that her lo retains its high - brightness character without appreciable degradation , see app .",
    "a.3 for details .",
    "prior to bpsk modulation , bob routes a small fraction of the light he receives to the single - photon detector that is his channel monitor .",
    "alice and bob use their channel monitors to measure the singles rates , @xmath11 for alice s idler beam , @xmath12 for alice s tap on her transmitted beam , and @xmath13 for bob s tap on his received beam .",
    "they also use their monitors to obtain @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the time - aligned and time - shifted coincidence rates between alice s idler and the tap on her transmitted beam , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the time - aligned and time - shifted coincidence rates between alice s idler and bob s tap on his received beam , in both cases employing a @xmath18-duration coincidence gate and accounting for the relevant propagation delays in the appropriate manners . from these rates they compute @xmath19/s_b}{[c_{ia}-\\widetilde{c}_{ia}]/s_a},\\ ] ] which will be shown below to quantify the integrity of the alice - to - bob channel .",
    "as detailed in app .",
    "b , eve s general frequency - domain collective attack is as follows .",
    "eve first establishes lossless connections between her equipment and the communicating parties in both the forward ( alice - to - bob ) and backward ( bob - to - alice ) channels . in the forward path",
    ", she performs a general unitary transformation that , during each of bob s bit intervals , acts in an independent , identically distributed manner on the @xmath20 frequency modes of alice s transmitted light . in particular , the inputs to that unitary transformation",
    "are alice s transmitted field and eve s @xmath21 vacuum - state ancilla fields .",
    "eve retains the @xmath21 ancilla fields that emerge from this unitary operation and sends the remaining field to bob .",
    "she completes her attack with a collective measurement on her stored ancilla fields and the light she taps from the bob - to - alice channel .",
    "here we note , see app .",
    "e , that @xmath22 is an intrusion parameter that quantifies eve s degradation of the phase - sensitive cross - covariance between alice s idler and bob s received light from what it would be were eve only mounting a passive attack .",
    "furthermore , we show in app .",
    "c.2 that eve s optimum frequency - domain collective attack ",
    "one that maximizes her holevo information for a given photon flux and @xmath22 value  is in fact gaussian and can be realized by her using an spdc source , injecting its signal light into bob through a beam splitter in the alice - to - bob fiber , while retaining her idler for a collective measurement with the light she taps from the alice - to - bob and bob - to - alice fibers , see fig .",
    "[ realization ] . for this optimum attack ,",
    "@xmath22 equals eve s injection fraction , viz .",
    ", the fraction of light entering bob s terminal that is due to her @xcite .",
    "hence that configuration will be employed throughout the security analysis below .",
    "( interestingly , this spdc beam - splitter attack has the same structure as the entangling - cloner attack on cv - qkd @xcite . )",
    "realization of eve s optimum frequency - domain collective attack .",
    "spdc : spontaneous parametric downconverter .",
    "eve s spdc signal beam ( shown ) is coupled to bob through a beam splitter , while her spdc idler beam ( not shown ) is retained for use in her receiver.,width=288 ]    we will be concerned with optimized performance for alice and bob against eve s optimum frequency - domain collective attack without regard for finite - key effects .",
    "( for fl - qkd s @xmath0gbps secret - key rates , finite - key effects become inconsequential for key - generation sessions as short as a few seconds . )",
    "thus , following standard practice for assessing security against collective attacks ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , we will find @xmath23 , a lower bound on alice and bob s secret - key rate , from @xmath24 where @xmath25 is alice and bob s shannon - information rate , @xmath26 is alice and bob s reconciliation efficiency , and @xmath27 is an upper bound on eve s holevo - information rate for her optimum frequency - domain collective attack . before doing so , let us provide some simple intuition about how fl - qkd can be secure against individual passive or active attacks",
    ".    we will limit our consideration of these individual attacks to low - brightness operation ( the ase - spdc light alice sends to bob has @xmath28 photon s@xmath6hz@xmath6 ) in a lossy scenario ( channel transmissivity @xmath29 ) with alice s source bandwidth @xmath7 greatly exceeding bob s bpsk modulation rate @xmath4 . for eve s passive attack",
    ", we neglect the small amount of spdc light in alice s transmission and the small amounts tapped by alice and bob for their channel monitors .",
    "alice s homodyne receiver and eve s optimum quantum receiver then have error probabilities satisfying @xmath30 @xcite and @xmath31 @xcite , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the gain and ase output - noise brightness of bob s optical amplifier . because @xmath34/\\ln[\\pr(e)_{\\rm eve}^{\\rm pass } ] \\sim 1/4n_s$ ] , we see that low - brightness ( @xmath35 ) operation affords alice and bob a considerable advantage over eve . physically , this advantage is due to the @xmath28 low - brightness condition s making eve unable to obtain a high - brightness reference  from the light she taps from the alice - to - bob fiber  with which to detect bob s bpsk modulation .",
    "later , we will see that this low - brightness condition ensures that eve s holevo information rate for her undetectable passive - eavesdropping attack falls far below alice and bob s shannon information rate .",
    "in other words , as claimed earlier , fl - qkd s transmitting less than one photon per mode makes it immune to the attack that has driven the highest - rate , long - distance qkd system to limit its transmissions to @xmath01photon / bit .    for eve s active attack",
    ", we employ the conditions applied above and , in addition , presume that alice and bob s channel monitors constrain their adversary s light injection to a small fraction , @xmath36 , of the light entering bob s terminal .",
    "the error probability of alice s homodyne receiver will then obey @xmath37 .",
    "eve s optimum quantum receiver  for an individual attack in the fig .",
    "[ realization ] setup using her optimum spdc - injection strategy in conjunction with a tap on just the bob - to - alice channel  then has error probability @xmath38 .",
    "now we find that @xmath34/\\ln[\\pr(e)_{\\rm eve}^{\\rm act } ] \\sim ( 1-f_e)/4f_e$ ] , which is highly favorable to alice and bob when their channel monitors limit eve to @xmath39 .",
    "having provided some individual - attack insights into fl - qkd s security , we return to the task of assessing our protocol s security analysis when eve mounts her optimum frequency - domain collective attack .",
    "to evaluate alice s error probability under that attack , we note the number of independent modes that contribute to the light alice receives from bob being much greater than one  for @xmath40thz with @xmath41gbps , as we will assume below , we get @xmath42justifies a central limit theorem argument that makes alice s error probability satisfy @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 for @xmath46 are the means and standard deviations of alice s homodyne measurement when bob s bit values ( phase modulations ) are equally likely to be 0 ( 0rad phase shift ) or 1 ( @xmath47rad phase shift ) , and @xmath48 . see app .",

    "thus , as suggested at the outset , security against a collective attack has been ensured by a combination of low - brightness transmission and coincidence - based channel monitoring .",
    "that fl - qkd has such a high rate after the 10db of one - way propagation loss incurred at 50 km is then due to its use of an optical bandwidth far in excess of its modulation rate , which enables alice to transmit many photons per bit ( ppb ) without affording eve very much information .",
    "this follows from fig .",
    "[ ppb](a ) , which plots the ppb that alice transmits to bob and the ppb that bob receives from alice .",

    "hence it can not match fl - qkd s loss - independent @xmath01 _ received _ ppb performance .",
    "thus its long - distance secret - key rate is vastly inferior to fl - qkd s .",
    "moreover , as noted earlier , an impractically large amount of wdm would be needed for that bb84 system to match fl - qkd s single - channel gbps secret - key rate capability over 50 km of fiber .    the story for huang _",

    "et al_. s system would still require more than 50 wdm channels to realize a 1gbps secret - key rate on a 50-km - long link .",
    "we will close our secret - key rate assessment with some additional comments on its underlying security analysis .",
    "consider first the optimality of eve s using spdc light injection in the fig .",
    "[ realization ] setup . for a given value of her injection fraction , @xmath22 ,",
    "eve s use of an spdc source in an active attack yields a holevo information that saturates the entanglement - assisted capacity for the channel created by her injection , bob s bpsk modulation and optical amplification , and her tap of the bob - to - alice channel .",
    "hence this confirms that no non - gaussian active attack with the same @xmath22 can do any better .",
    "this behavior is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ppb](b ) , for a 50 km one - way path length and @xmath77 , where we have plotted our upper bound on eve s active - attack holevo information per mode versus alice s signal brightness , @xmath79 , along with eve s entanglement - assisted capacity @xcite .",
    "further insights from fig .",
    "[ ppb](b ) come from its display of eve s passive - attack and optimum frequency - domain collective attack holevo informations per mode @xcite .",
    "when @xmath80 , the active attack is almost as powerful as the optimum frequency - domain collective attack , but at @xmath81 the passive attack makes the dominant contribution to the optimum frequency - domain collective attack @xcite .",
    "these characteristics are easily understood from the simple , individual - attack error probabilities we presented earlier .",

    "bob will transmit his detection times to alice  over their tamper - proof classical connection  and alice , in turn , will merge that data with her own to find the singles and coincidence rates she needs to determine the value of eve s intrusion parameter , @xmath22 .",
    "as part of her frequency - domain collective attack , eve can listen to alice and bob s classical channel , and use bob s photon - detection information to help her decode bob s transmission .",
    "the security analysis we have presented thus far does not account for that possibility .",

    "indeed , the resolution of the secret - key rate plot in fig .",
    "3(a ) is insufficient to show the effect .",
    "although eve s frequency - domain collective attack derives no appreciable benefit from learning the photon - detection times of bob s channel monitor , she could take an altogether different approach to breaking fl - qkd : an intercept - resend attack . by detecting the photons that alice sends to bob",
    ", eve could transmit her own light  with photons concentrated at those detection times  in the hope that bob s channel - monitor data will be indistinguishable from what he would get were she not present . whether eve could do so without changing alice and bob s @xmath22 measurement",
    "is unclear , as is whether eve could do so while simultaneously being able to retain a suitable reference beam for decoding bob s message , but it is important to note that intercept - resend is _ not _ a frequency - domain collective attack , although security against it would be included were we able to prove fl - qkd s security against a general coherent attack . even without that coherent - attack analysis ,",
    "alice and bob s can augment their channel monitors to at least _ detect _ an intercept - resend attack  and hence turn it into a denial - of - service attack  by exploiting the entanglement between the signal and idler outputs of alice s spdc source .",
    "alice and bob s coincidence - based channel monitoring only relies on the photon - paired nature of those signal and idler beams , which is why eve could potentially duplicate that pairing .",
    "entanglement , on the other hand , can not be spoofed .",
    "so , if alice and bob add either dispersive - optics ( frequency - domain coincidence ) measurements ( as in @xcite ) , or a franson interferometer ( as in @xcite ) , to their channel monitors , it will be impossible for eve to mount an intercept - resend attack without being detected .    in conclusion ,",
    "existing single - channel qkd systems secret - key rates at 50 km are so low that their gbps wdm versions have overwhelming implementation and cost issues .",

    "<S> more importantly , fl - qkd is capable of a 2gbps secret - key rate over a 50 km fiber link , _ without _ any multiplexing , using available equipment , i.e. , no new technology need be developed . </S>",
    "<S> fl - qkd achieves this extraordinary secret - key rate by virtue of its unprecedented secret - key efficiency , in bits per channel use , which exceeds those of state - of - the - art systems by two orders of magnitude . </S>"
