    "broad absorption line ( bal ) qsos show very broad blueshifted absorption troughs indicating outflows up to @xmath5 , with covering fractions @xmath6 @xcite , and soft x - ray hydrogen column densities often exceeding @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "these outflows carry a significant fraction of the accretion power and there is evidence that they are radiatively driven @xcite , suggesting that bal qso black holes accrete close to the eddington limit .",
    "many bal qsos , especially those with low ionization absorption troughs , are reddened @xcite , suggesting that bal qsos may be young qsos ejecting a birth - cocoon of dusty gas to reveal the unobscured optical qso @xcite . with the discovery of many bal qsos at @xmath8 , we are able to explore this idea by comparing eddington accretion ratio ( @xmath2 ) directly with fueling indicators in bal and non - bal qsos",
    ".    we can estimate @xmath9 and hence @xmath2 for @xmath8 qsos using observed continuum luminosity and fwhm  h@xmath0 in the following way : if qso broad line region ( blr ) gas motion is dominated by gravity , the black hole mass ( @xmath9 ) can be calculated from the typical orbital radius of blr clouds and their typical velocity : @xmath10 .",
    "blr radius @xmath11 can be represented by blr size ( @xmath12 ) derived from h@xmath0 reverberation mapping : @xmath12 can be estimated from continuum luminosity at rest wavelength 5100 : @xmath13@xmath14 @xcite ; @xmath15 can be represented by h@xmath0 full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "the @xmath9 so derived agree with the @xmath9 derived independently from the @xmath9 - bulge luminosity and @xmath16 relationships for nearby qsos , where @xmath17 is the velocity dispersion of the bulge @xcite .",
    "the fueling could be indicated by correlated emission line properties .",
    "one of the strongest sets of relationships among qso properties describes the increasing strength of optical with decreasing [ ]  @xmath185007 , increasing steepness of the soft x - ray continuum , and decreasing width and stronger blue wing of the broad h@xmath0 emission line ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereinafter bg92 ) .",
    "here we call this set of relationships boroson & green eigenvector 1 ( bgev1 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that bgev1 is driven by @xmath2 for the following reasons .",
    "* for a given luminosity , narrower h@xmath0 corresponds to smaller @xmath9 and higher @xmath2 .",
    "* by analogy with galactic black hole binary systems , it has been suggested that steeper x - ray spectra indicate higher @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "near - eddington accretion results in geometrically thick accretion disks which produce excess soft x - ray photons ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . * strong optical emission and weak [ ] emission",
    "indicate high optical depth , high density nuclear gas that may provide an abundant fuel supply for near - eddington accretion .",
    "optically thick gas reduces ionizing photons that reach the [ ] narrow line region ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "strong suggests that this gas may have been metal - enriched by star formation .",
    "the few known bal qsos at low @xmath3 tend to have narrow h@xmath0 , weak [ ] and strong emission @xcite suggesting high @xmath2 and an abundant fuel supply .",
    "most bals are discovered in qsos with @xmath19 , where the broad troughs are shifted into the optical window .",
    "for those redshifts the h@xmath0 region is shifted to the near infrared .",
    "we therefore performed near infrared spectroscopy , taking advantage of new qso surveys that do not use uv selection and yield many more bal qsos than previously recognized @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we investigate whether bal qsos have extreme bgev1 properties , using fwhm  h@xmath0 and continuum luminosity to calculate @xmath2 , and then compare @xmath2 with and [ ] strengths .",
    "detailed discussion of the observations , reductions and analysis , with results from a larger data set , will be published later .",
    "our high redshift ( @xmath8 ) sample consists of 37 qsos .",
    "we observed 11 bal qsos from the large bright qso survey , the first bright qso survey and @xcite .",
    "qsos of similar redshift and luminosity were observed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereinafter m99a ) .",
    "we included their observations having acceptable signal - to - noise ratio , to make a total sample of 17 bal qsos , 13 radio - loud ( rl ) qsos and 7 non - bal radio - quiet ( rq ) qsos .",
    "we and m99a chose the brightest optically - selected qsos at @xmath8 .",
    "our new spectra were obtained with the cgs4 near infrared spectrograph on the united kingdom infra - red telescope ( ukirt ) .",
    "the detector was the 256x256 insb nicmos array .",
    "with the 40  l  mm@xmath20 low resolution grating , a slit width of 1.2 yielded a resolution of 3 pixels as measured from ar and xe comparison lamp spectra ( @xmath21  km  s@xmath20 in j band and @xmath22  km  s@xmath20 in h band ) .",
    "the two - dimensional spectral images were reduced using ukirt s orac data reduction pipeline .",
    "we used standard iraf tasks to optimally extract the spectra and calibrate their wavelength scales .",
    "atmospheric features were removed and spectral shape calibration was done by division by the observed spectra of f - g stars using a temperature implied by the spectral type .",
    "the f - g stars and the wavelength comparison lamps were observed within 0.1 airmasses of the qsos .",
    "our reduced spectra have signal - to - noise ratios of from 10 to 20 per 3-pixel bin near h@xmath0 .",
    "measuring line and continuum properties in the h@xmath0 region is complicated by the blending of many broad optical lines .",
    "we used specfit @xcite within iraf to deblend spectral components for both our ukirt and the m99a spectra .",
    "we decomposed each spectrum into a powerlaw continuum , broad and narrow h@xmath0 components , a broad h@xmath23 component , a narrow - line [ ] doublet and emission blends .",
    "the fixed parameters were the power - law continuum parameters ( slope and normalization estimated by eye ) , the [ ]  @xmath244959,5007 doublet ratio of 2.94 , the h@xmath23/h@xmath0 ratio of 0.36 , and the narrow h@xmath0 to [ ]  @xmath185007 ratio of 0.1 @xcite . except for some m99a",
    "spectra with known broad [ ] lines , the narrow h@xmath0 and [ ] lines were represented by single gaussians with width equal to the instrumental resolution ( bg92 ) .",
    "the emission blends were represented by the bg92 i  zw  1 template .",
    "all broad lines including were assumed to have the same gaussian profile .",
    "rest wavelength ratios were constrained except for some mcintosh et al .",
    "objects with shifted [ ] lines @xcite .",
    "free parameters were the intensities of [ ] , broad h@xmath0 , the blends , and broad line widths .    in many cases ,",
    "since a single gaussian profile was inadequate to represent the broad h@xmath0 line , we adopted the following procedure after running specfit .",
    "we first subtracted all fitted components except broad h@xmath0 and smoothed the remaining h@xmath0 by fitting multiple gaussian profiles , each at least as wide as the instrumental resolution , then measured the integrated flux and fwhm of the smoothed profile .",
    "we tested our measurement method on bg92 spectra , finding no systematic difference from their results . for objects without measurable [ ] or lines , we estimated @xmath25 upper limits based on the signal - to - noise ratio and spectral resolution of each spectrum .",
    "the typical rms uncertainties of our measurements for the high redshift qsos are 10% for [ ]  @xmath185007 equivalent width ( ew ) for objects with detected [ ] , 10% for fwhm  h@xmath0 , and about 20% for /h@xmath0 ratios .",
    "figure  [ spectra ] shows the fits for three typical spectra .",
    "the bal qso spectrum is from our new ukirt data .",
    "the rl and rq qso spectra are from our refitting of the m99a data .",
    "to calculate @xmath9 and @xmath2 , we need @xmath26 at rest frame wavelengths of 5100 and 3000 to estimate the blr size , and the bolometric luminosity : @xmath27@xmath28 @xcite .",
    "bal qsos tend to have reddened continua compared with optically selected non - bal qsos , so the @xmath26 were calculated using h band magnitudes from the the 2mass survey , assuming @xmath29 .",
    "using the most recent bal qso colors derived from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , we estimate a generous upper limit for extinction at the observed h band correponding to @xmath300.8 mag for @xmath8 , corresponding to under - estimates of black hole mass and eddington ratio by factors of @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively .",
