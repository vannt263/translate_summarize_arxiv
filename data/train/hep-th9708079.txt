    "we follow a different approach along the line of @xmath1-point correlation dynamics @xcite-@xcite , which consists in a truncation of the hierarchy of equations of motion for equal - time green functions in terms of connected green functions up to order @xmath1 . in relativistic field theory",
    "the method has previously been applied successfully to @xmath2 theory in @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath0 spacetime dimensions @xcite .",
    "the novel phenomenon in the application of @xmath1-point correlation dynamics to yang - mills theory in temporal gauge is the requirement of gauss law constraints on physical states .",
    "we apply 2- , 3- , and 4-point correlation dynamics to the simplest nontrivial yang - mills theory , i.e. su(2 ) in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "the theory has the advantage of being not only superrenormalizable but finite @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in section [ quantization ] we discuss our procedure of quantization in temporal gauge , which involves fixing the residual gauge freedom . in section [ eomcgf ]",
    "we present the derivation of the correlation dynamical equations of motion while in section [ gausshierarchy ] we discuss the hierarchy of constraints for equal - time green functions that arises from gauss law . in section",
    "[ propagate ] we present numerical results for the propagation of the system with given initial conditions for a variety of approximation schemes and investigate scaling , infrared and ultraviolet properties of the corresponding approximations . in section [ adiabaticswitching ]",

    "in this section we discuss the quantization of su(n ) yang - mills theories in temporal gauge ( @xmath5 ) and the corresponding free propagator .",
    "we first turn to the discussion of canonical quantization .",

    ", repeated indices of any kind will be summed over .",
    "the corresponding @xmath5 gauge quantum hamiltonian is @xcite @xmath11 and the canonical equal - time commutation relations are @xmath12 = i \\delta_{ij } \\delta^{ab } \\delta(\\vec{x}-\\vec{y } ) \\ ; , \\label{commutator}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where now the latin indices @xmath13 , @xmath14 only run over the @xmath15 spatial components of the gauge field and @xmath16 denote the conjugate momenta .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations following from ( [ lagrangian ] ) in the @xmath5 gauge for the spatial components of the gauge field @xmath17 can be reproduced with ( [ hamiltonian ] ) and ( [ commutator ] ) as the heisenberg equations for the operators @xmath17 and @xmath16 .",
    "in contrast to that , the euler - lagrange equation for @xmath18 , the gauss law , is not contained in the dynamics generated by ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "it can , furthermore , not be realized as an operator identity , since this would contradict the commutation relations ( [ commutator ] ) .",
    "the gauss law thus has to be imposed as a constraint on physical states : @xmath19 one possibility to arrive at the above formulation of temporal gauge yang - mills theory is to directly deduce it from the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) , as we have just outlined , which involves right from the start to introduce a hilbert space of wave functionals that depend on the spatial components of the gauge field , only .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that , alternatively , one can start from a lagrangian containing an additional ( covariant gauge ) gauge fixing term , and first introduce a hilbert space of wave functionals depending on all @xmath6 spacetime components of the gauge field .",
    "the wave functionals then , in addition to gauss law , have to fulfill the lorentz condition , which can be used to obtain the above temporal gauge formulation by a separation of variables @xcite .",
    "the nontrivial aspects of the temporal gauge formulation now arise by the fact that the condition @xmath5 does not fix the gauge completely , and there is a residual gauge symmetry consisting in the subgroup of all time independent gauge transformations ( that tend to 1 at spatial infinity in the continuum or are periodic on a torus ) .",
    "the gauss law operators @xmath20 defined in ( [ gausslaw ] ) are the generators of this residual gauge symmetry , i.e. we have @xmath21=0 \\label{gaussconserve}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and for infinitesimal @xmath22 ( tending to zero at spatial infinity in the continuum or being periodic on a torus ) @xmath23=e^{-i\\int d^d x \\theta^b(\\vec{x } ) g^b(\\vec{x } ) } \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ & & u^{-1}[\\theta]a^a_i(\\vec{x})u[\\theta ] = g f^{abc } \\theta^b(\\vec{x } ) a^c_i(\\vec{x } ) - \\partial_{x_i } \\theta^a(\\vec{x } ) \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ & & u^{-1}[\\theta]\\pi^a_i(\\vec{x})u[\\theta ] = g f^{abc } \\theta^b(\\vec{x } ) \\pi^c_i(\\vec{x } ) \\ ; . \\label{resgaugetraf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] condition ( [ gausslaw ] ) thus requires the physical states to be gauge invariant , i.e. @xmath24 |\\psi_{ph } \\rangle = |\\psi_{ph } \\rangle \\ ; , \\label{stateinv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which also implies that the physical states are non - normalizable .",
    "the residual gauge freedom can now be dealt with in different ways .",
    "one possibility is to eliminate the remaining unphysical degrees of freedom and to formulate the theory entirely in terms of unconstrained variables .",
    "this can either be achieved by a change of variables @xcite or by applying unitary gauge fixing transformations @xcite .",
    "a formulation in terms of unconstrained degrees of freedom as a starting point for nonperturbative calculations has the advantage , that the gauss law ( [ gausslaw ] ) does not have to be observed as an additional constraint in an approximation scheme , since it is already implemented in the choice of variables .",
    "furthermore , the wave functionals defined with respect to the unconstrained variables are then normalizable .",
    "however , such formulations have the disadvantage of leading to highly complicated ( in general non - polynomial ) expressions for the corresponding quantum hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "the application of correlation dynamics is , however , restricted to simple forms of the hamiltonian containing only low order polynomials in the fields .",
    "we will thus employ a different method for dealing with the residual gauge freedom ( [ gaussconserve ] ) , ( [ resgaugetraf ] ) , which consists in introducing a nontrivial integral measure for matrix elements between physical states obeying ( [ gausslaw ] ) by means of the usual fadeev - popov method ( cf . @xcite and for a simple example appendix [ simpleex ] ) .",
    "we start by considering the matrix element of a gauge invariant operator @xmath25 ( i.e. , @xmath26=0 $ ] ) between two physical states @xmath27 and @xmath28 : @xmath29 \\ ; \\phi^*_{ph}[a ] o^a_{inv } \\psi_{ph}[a ] \\ ; , \\ ; \\ ; o^a_{inv } \\psi_{ph}[a ] \\equiv \\langle a | o_{inv } |\\psi_{ph}\\rangle \\ ; . \\label{startmatel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the integrand in ( [ startmatel ] ) is gauge invariant , in order to obtain a well defined result it is sufficient to choose the integral measure @xmath30 $ ] to contain a factor of the inverse of the ( infinite ) volume of the residual gauge group , i.e. @xmath31=\\left ( \\int { \\cal d}h[u ] \\right)^{-1 } { \\cal d}a \\ ; , \\label{invariantintmeasure}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that the physical states can be chosen to be normalized in the following way : @xmath32 \\ ; \\psi^*_{ph}[a]\\psi_{ph}[a ] = ( \\int { \\cal d}h[u])^{-1 } \\int { \\cal d}a \\ ; \\psi^*_{ph}[a]\\psi_{ph}[a ] = 1 \\ ; . \\label{normalization}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath33 $ ] is the haar measure for the integration over the residual gauge group and @xmath34 .",

    "the use of ( [ intmeasure ] ) for the definition of matrix elements in the space of physical states now has important consequences for the hermiticity properties of gauge invariant operators such as the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",

    "the above mentioned additional nontrivial terms then arise as hermiticity - destroying surface contributions in the partial integration .",
    "in general , we note that the heisenberg time evolution of gauge dependent quantities does not give the same result as the schrdinger time evolution and yields time dependencies even if the system is in an equilibrium situation ( e.g. , an eigenstate of ( [ hamiltonian ] ) ) .",
    "also , in the schrdinger picture the gauge fixing condition @xmath37=0 $ ] is fulfilled at all times , while in the heisenberg picture it is only fulfilled at the time of coincidence with the schrdinger picture .",
    "however , if one considers the time evolution of gauge invariant quantities , both pictures give identical results ( e.g. , if one reconstructs an equilibrium expectation value of a gauge invariant quantity from gauge dependent quantities , all time dependencies in the heisenberg picture must cancel out ) .",
    "thus , since all physical obervables are gauge invariant , the schrdinger and the heisenberg picture are of course still equivalent . from a technical point of view , in order to generate equations of motion for green functions from the schrdinger picture , one would have to explicitly carry out the partial integration outlined above , which leads to nontrivial additional terms ( containing the fadeev - popov ( ghost ) and gauge fixing contributions which arise due to the fixing of the residual spatial gauge freedom ) .",
    "one immediate consequence of the above considerations is the appearance of a term explicitly breaking time translation invariance in the free propagator as determined by the abelian limit of the heisenberg equations of motion . if we choose the condition that fixes the residual gauge freedom to be the coulomb gauge condition @xmath52=\\partial_{x_i } a^a_i(\\vec{x})=0 \\ ; , \\label{coulombfix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we obtain ( in the continuum ) , if the heisenberg and the schrdinger picture coincide at time @xmath53 , @xmath54 \\ ; , \\label{mypropagator}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 denotes the time ordering operator .",
    "a derivation of this result within the framework of canonical quantization can e.g. be found in @xcite .",
    "we note in passing , that ( [ coulombfix ] ) at an intermediate time @xmath56 might still not be a sufficient gauge fixing condition due to gribov ambiguities . a detailed discussion of this issue ,",
    "however , is beyond the scope of this article .    the first authors to come up with a longitudinal propagator as contained in ( [ mypropagator ] ) were carraciolo , curci and menotti @xcite , who obtained their result in a more heuristic way by first writing down the most general solution of the equation of motion .",
    "this solution , which is in addition required to be symmetric in @xmath57 and @xmath58 and to fulfill the condition @xmath59 , reads @xmath60 in ( [ ccmgeneral ] ) the subscript @xmath61 stands for the longitudinal part of the gauge field .",
    "now perturbatively evaluating the wilson loop up to order @xmath62 and comparing the final result to that obtained in feynman and coulomb gauge , the requirement of gauge invariance leads to the condition @xmath63 , while @xmath64 gives no contribution to the wilson loop .",
    "the result @xmath65 is obtained in the above mentioned canonical derivation if instead of ( [ gausslaw ] ) one uses the condition @xmath66 which also leads to a consistent formulation of the theory .",
    "note that @xmath67 and that both ( [ gausslaw ] ) and ( [ gaussdagger ] ) can not be imposed simultaneously , since this would contradict ( [ commutator ] ) .",
    "the authors in @xcite then conclude that contact with the coulomb gauge can only be made at @xmath68 ( or equivalently at one of the endpoints of a finite time strip ) .",
    "this is true if the coulomb gauge condition requires every green function containing a longitudinal gauge field @xmath69 to vanish .",
    "this , however , would imply that @xmath70 has to be taken to infinity at some stage of the calculation .",
    "in order to shed some light on the last point we will conclude this section by briefly discussing path integral quantization in temporal gauge . after carrying out the @xmath5 gauge fixing ,",
    "one is left with a ghost - free path integral , that however still contains an integration over the residual gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "if one now fixes this residual gauge freedom via the fadeev - popov method with the coulomb gauge condition at time @xmath53 , i.e. @xmath71 one arrives at @xcite @xmath72 for the longitudinal part of the free propagator .",
    "moreover , in the nonabelian theory the gauge fixing condition ( [ pathcoulombfix ] ) leads to ghosts that live on a spacetime hypersurface of fixed time @xmath53 .",
    "( [ leroypropagator ] ) gives zero if @xmath53 lies in between @xmath57 and @xmath58 and it agrees with ( [ ccmgeneral ] ) for @xmath65 if @xmath73 and for @xmath74 if @xmath75 .",
    "agreement between ( [ leroypropagator ] ) and ( [ mypropagator ] ) can thus be achieved only in the limit @xmath76 .",
    "the disagreement between both results in case of a finite value of @xmath53 , however , can easily be understood to arise from the difference in the way the coulomb gauge condition is implemented in our canonical approach and in the path integral approach .",
    "the use of the integral measure ( [ intmeasure ] ) induced by ( [ coulombfix ] ) for the definition of matrix elements between physical states only leads to vanishing green functions if @xmath69 stands to the left of all other operators ( for a simple example we refer the reader to appendix [ simpleex ] ) , while the implementation of ( [ coulombfix ] ) in the path integral formulation forces all green functions containing @xmath69 to vanish irrespective of the operator ordering ( that arises from the time ordering being carried out ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that there is no a priori contradiction between ( [ mypropagator ] ) and ( [ leroypropagator ] ) , since both are in fact derived from inequivalent gauge fixing conditions",
    ".    on one hand , we are now in a position to formulate simple heisenberg dynamics employing the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , on the other hand we have to deal with explicit time dependencies and the gauss law ( [ gausslaw ] ) as an additional constraint .",
    "we now turn to the derivation of a closed set of equations of motion for connected equal - time green functions within the approximation scheme of correlation dynamics .",
    "the derivation of these equations up to the 4-point level has already been presented in @xcite for the full su(n ) qcd lagrangian containing gauge bosons and massless fermions , however , in order to make this article self - contained we will repeat the main steps for the pure gauge boson sector in this section .",
    "we also point out that in the present article we no longer adopt the quantization scheme outlined in @xcite , which is based on the  weak  version of gauss law , i.e. requiring only @xmath77 .",
    "the starting point for our derivation are the operator equations of motion that arise from the heisenberg equation ( if not explicitly stated otherwise , all time derivatives will from now on refer to the heisenberg picture ) @xmath78 \\ ; . \\label{heisenbergequation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with ( [ heisenbergequation ] ) , ( [ hamiltonian ] ) and ( [ commutator ] ) one obtains @xmath79 and @xmath80 where all operators are taken at the same time @xmath57 , which has been suppressed in our notation . in the same way one obtains the equations of motion for higher order equal - time operator products , e.g. @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83",
    "we thus arrive at an infinite coupled hierarchy of operator equations of motion , where the time derivative of each product of @xmath1 field operators containing at least one conjugate field momentum couples to products of @xmath1 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 field operators ; the latter correspond to the free propagation and the gauge boson selfinteraction via the 3 point vertex and the 4 point vertex , respectively .",
    "( [ aeqom])-([ppeqom ] ) and the corresponding equations for higher order operator products now straightforwardly induce an infinite hierarchy of equations of motion for full equal - time green functions , the latter being defined as the expectation values of the above equal - time operator products .",

    "the equations of motion for full equal - time green functions corresponding to ( [ aeqom ] ) , ( [ peqom ] ) , etc . , are therefore given by @xmath95 @xmath96    the hierarchy consisting of ( [ greenaeqom ] ) , ( [ greenpeqom ] ) and the corresponding higher order equations can be seen as the field theoretical analogue to the bbgky ( born bogoliubov green kirkwood yvon ) density matrix hierarchy known from nonrelativistic many body theory .",
    "the only new feature is the difference between the hierarchies arising from the heisenberg and the schrdinger picture , as it has already been discussed in section [ quantization ] .",
    "we note in passing that , in the schrdinger picture , the von neumann equation remains valid also for the description of the time evolution of gauge dependent operators , since for its derivation only the hermiticity of @xmath97 in the space of physical states is needed ( all manipulations in the derivation are carried out to the right of @xmath86 ) .",
    "one could then be tempted to recover the heisenberg picture result by using invariance of the trace under cyclic permutations .",
    "this , however , is incorrect , since the trace can not be extended to run over a large enough space of states in order to allow for an application of the completeness relation as required for the proof of cyclic permutation invariance .    for practical calculations ,",

    "the reader is , however , referred to our previous article @xcite , which contains the explicit 4-point equations in coordinate space in a notation that is compactified using permutation operators .",
    "in addition to the equations of motion following from the heisenberg equation  discussed in the preceding section  the equal - time green functions have to fulfill the conditions that can be derived from gauss law ( [ gausslaw ] ) , which , as stated in section [ quantization ] , is not automatically contained in the hamiltonian dynamics of the theory .",
    "the present section is devoted to the discussion of these gauss law conditions .",
    "we first note that from ( [ gausslaw ] ) we immediately get @xmath126 for any product of field operators @xmath86 and for any physical state @xmath28 . for an arbitrary expectation value ( [ traceo ] ) we thus have @xmath127 which in principle already comprises the complete set of equations for equal - time green functions that can be derived from gauss law .",
    "it is important to point out that in ( [ ogaussexpectation ] ) @xmath20 stands to the right of all other operators and that the operator ordering can not be reversed by invoking hermiticity arguments ( the gauss law operator , although hermitean in the space of normalizable states , loses this property in the present case @xcite ) .",
    "if we replace @xmath86 in ( [ ogaussexpectation ] ) by a product of @xmath1 field operators , then ( due to the structure of @xmath20 ) we get a relation between a full @xmath84- and a full @xmath85-point equal - time function .",
    "thus , as in the case of the heisenberg equations of motion , we are left with an infinite coupled hierarchy of equations . in the simplest case ,",
    "@xmath128 , we obtain a relation between 1- and 2-point functions : @xmath129 on the next level , with @xmath130 and @xmath131 , we get two different relations between 2- and 3-point functions : @xmath132 @xmath133 again one level higher we get three different relations between 3- and 4-point functions by choosing @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 .",

    "the second term vanishes due to ( [ gaussconserve ] ) .",
    "thus , in principle , the hierarchy of slavnov - taylor identities can be fulfilled by an appropriate choice of initial conditions for the equal - time heisenberg hierarchy .",
    "this last property , however , only holds if we consider an exact solution of the hierarchy of equations of motion ; it breaks down for solutions within our approximation scheme .",
    "this comes about for two different reasons :    \\a ) since for our numerical calculations we consider the theory on a torus and only take into account a finite number of plane wave states , identity ( [ gaussconserve ] ) is violated , i.e. if @xmath97 and @xmath20 are replaced by the corresponding finite momentum space representation , their commutator does not vanish any more .",
    "this is nothing but the well known fact that any simple momentum cutoff violates gauge invariance . in section [ propagate ]",
    "we will discuss how this can be partly remedied by considering different momentum cutoffs for the 2- and the 3-point functions .",
    "\\b ) the truncation in terms of connected green functions is not fully consistent with the constraint hierarchy following from gauss law , so that even for a regularization scheme that preserves gauge invariance , not all slavnov - taylor identities would be conserved in time .    in order to investigate the last point in more detail in the su(2 ) case , we first note that the 2- , 3- , and 4-point correlation dynamical equations of motion  regardless of the finite momentum basis  conserve the following global colour singlet structure of connected equal - time green functions ( @xmath86 denotes fields @xmath39 and/or conjugate momenta @xmath144 ) : @xmath145",
    "@xmath146 @xmath147 where we have @xmath148 for colour su(2 ) . here",
    "the double brackets @xmath149 denote a colour independent function , depending only on the spatial coordinates and the vector indices of the corresponding field operators .",
    "the notation using operators without colour indices inside the double brackets is to be understood as purely symbolic and is only supposed to indicate the kind of field ( a or @xmath144 ) to which the spatial coordinates and vector indices belong ( our notation should especially not be confused with that of matrix valued fields in the fundamental representation of su(2 ) ) . while for the 2-point functions we have @xmath150 and @xmath151 the colour independent 3-point function , due to the antisymmetry of the su(2 ) structure constants , is antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of any pair of fields or momenta , i.e. we have @xmath152    the color structure of the connected 4-point functions is more involved and given in appendix [ fourpointcolourstructure ] .",
    "since our condition for fixing the residual gauge freedom ( [ coulombfix ] ) does not prefer any direction in colour space , we always have such a global singlet configuration and can therefore make use of ( [ onepointcolourstructure ] ) , ( [ twopointcolourstructure ] ) , ( [ threepointcolourstructure ] ) , and ( [ fourpointcolourstructure1])-([fourpointcolourstructure4 ] ) for an explicit reduction of the number of degrees of freedom appearing in the correlation dynamical equations .",
    "this , as well as the proof of the conservation of the above colour structure by @xmath1-point correlation dynamics ( @xmath153 ) , is straightforward but lengthy and has been carried out by means of computer algebra .",
    "one immediate consequence of ( [ onepointcolourstructure ] ) is that the full 2- and 3-point functions do not have disconnected parts and therefore equal the connected 2- and 3-point functions .",
    "furthermore , ( [ stident1 ] ) is trivially conserved within correlation dynamics , since for all times we have @xmath154    also , due to the global colour singlet structure , identities ( [ stident2 ] ) and ( [ stident3 ] ) , relating full 2- and 3-point functions , directly become identities for connected green functions .",
    "the gauss law constraints of higher order , relating full @xmath1- and @xmath84-point functions , in general translate into identities relating connected @xmath1- and @xmath84-point functions and products of all lower order connected equal - time functions down to the connected 2-point function .",
    "thus , within an @xmath1-point truncation scheme , all identities up to the one relating the full @xmath155- and @xmath1-point functions remain unchanged , and the identities relating the full @xmath1- and @xmath84-point functions have to be truncated by neglecting the connected @xmath84-point function ; e.g. within a 3-point truncation scheme one has relations between connected 2- and 3-point functions and identities relating connected 3-point functions to products of 2 connected 2-point functions .    since the conservation of a gauss law constraint identity , as stated above , requires the conservation of the identities of the 2 next higher orders , a truncation in terms of connected green functions up to a certain order in general leads to a non - conservation of ( [ stident2 ] ) , ( [ stident3 ] ) , and the higher order constraints .    a subset of conserved identities can nevertheless be obtained if , instead of multiplying @xmath20 from the left with an arbitrary operator product , one considers expectation values of products of several gauss law operators . in general , a product of @xmath1 gauss law operators contains products of up to @xmath156 fields or momenta , and its expectation value is thus conserved within a @xmath156-point truncation scheme as long as @xmath157=0 $ ] @xcite .",
    "the conservation of these identities is of course destroyed as soon as we work within a finite momentum basis .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention , that within the framework of correlation dynamics for nonrelativistic fermion systems there exists a constraint , that is violated in a similar way by the @xmath1-point truncation scheme as the gauss law in the present case of correlation dynamics for a nonabelian gauge theory .",
    "this constraint is the requirement that the system has good particle number , i.e. if @xmath158 is the number operator and @xmath159 is the hamiltonian , with @xmath160=0 $ ] , and @xmath161 is the state describing the system in fock space , we impose the constraint @xmath162 from which we directly obtain @xmath163 for any operator @xmath86 . by inserting any possible product of creation and annihilation operators for @xmath86",
    "we obtain a constraint hierarchy similar to the hierarchy of slavnov - taylor identities as obtained above from gauss law .",
    "this constraint hierarchy is nothing but the set of trace relations relating the @xmath1-body ( @xmath156-point ) and the @xmath84-body ( @xmath164-point ) density matrices of a pure @xmath120-particle wavefunction , which is well known to be violated within the correlation dynamics approach . just as in the case of gauss law",
    "a subset of conserved identities within a @xmath156-point truncation can be obtained by considering the expectation values of @xmath165 , @xmath166 ( e.g. @xmath167 is conserved within 2-body ( 4-point ) correlation dynamics ) .",
    "however , there is still a major qualitative difference between the gauss law in yang - mills theory and the trace relations in fermionic many - body theory .",
    "while the gauss law ( [ gausslaw ] ) is induced by a local gauge symmetry , condition ( [ goodnumber ] ) is induced by a global symmetry .",
    "therefore particle number conservation is not violated on the operator level , if the theory is considered within a finite single particle basis .    while the violation of the trace relations was found to be only weak and without significant impact on the time evolution of the system at least for the application of correlation dynamics to light nuclei @xcite , it is not a priori clear if this will also be the case with the violation of gauss law in temporal gauge yang - mills theory and has to be studied explicitly .",
    "for our numerical calculations we consider su(2 ) and expand the fields and conjugate momenta into plane wave states on a torus in @xmath0 spacetime dimensions according to @xmath168 where @xmath61 is the size of the 2-dimensional box ( of volume @xmath169 ) and the momentum vectors @xmath170 are chosen according to the periodicity condition @xmath171 the equal - time green functions and the correlation dynamical equations of motion are expanded accordingly .    in this section",
    "we investigate the behaviour of the system in the weak coupling limit by choosing certain initial conditions and propagating the connected equal - time green functions according to the correlation dynamical equations of motion in different approximation schemes .",
    "the weak coupling limit is considered , since the properties of the regularized system with a given number of basis states are uniquely determined by the dimensionless quantity @xmath172 ( recall that in @xmath0 dimensions @xmath173 has the dimension of energy ) ; the limit @xmath174 is therefore equivalent to the small volume limit .",
    "this should in turn make sure that the different numbers of basis states considered suffice to allow for an investigation of the asymptotic behaviour as the ultraviolet cutoff is taken to infinity .    in order to investigate the nonabelian aspects we , furthermore , start with perturbative initial conditions that are close to the configuration given by the equal - time limit of ( [ mypropagator ] ) at @xmath175 .",
    "the advantage is that with ( [ mypropagator ] ) , at @xmath175 only the coupling terms contribute in the equations of motion , while the free ( abelian ) terms vanish ( up to the explicit time dependence already present in the abelian ground state solution ) .",
    "otherwise the time evolution in the weak coupling limit is usually dominated by the ( uninteresting ) propagation of a free field .",
    "the equal - time limit of ( [ mypropagator ] ) at @xmath175 leads to @xmath176 @xmath177 @xmath178 @xmath179 all higher order connected green functions vanish .",
    "note that while @xmath180 , @xmath181 , and @xmath182 are purely transverse due to the gauge fixing condition ( [ coulombfix ] ) and the abelian limit of gauss law ( [ gausslaw ] ) , this is no longer the case for @xmath183 .    while in principle the size @xmath61 of the box introduces an infrared scale into the theory , ( [ aaccmini ] )  due to the periodic boundary conditions  still contains an infrared singularity which has to be regularized in some way .",
    "the task of finding gauge invariant infrared regulators for yang - mills theories is nontrivial @xcite and the resulting theory would in general be hard to handle in the framework of correlation dynamics .",
    "we , therefore , resort to two different ways of handling this problem without having to introduce an additional mass scale by hand : we either leave out the zero momentum mode ( which is not a gauge invariant prescription ) or selfconsistently generate a mass for the initial condition by solving the quantum mechanical problem for the zero mode , only , which is described by the hamiltonian @xmath184 with @xmath185 , @xmath186 and @xmath187=i \\delta^{ab } \\delta_{ij}$ ] .",
    "the gaussian ansatz @xmath188 yields the configuration of lowest energy within the 2-point truncation scheme for @xmath189 and hence an effective mass @xmath190 thus instead of ( [ aaccmini ] ) and ( [ ppccmini ] ) we use ( @xmath191 ) @xmath192 @xmath193 together with ( [ apccmini ] ) and ( [ paccmini ] ) as initial conditions and include @xmath194 , such that at @xmath175 the free propagation terms and the terms describing the coupling to the zero mode via the 4-point vertex cancel out .",
    "before we begin our further investigation we note that , according to our experience , the solutions of the equations of @xmath1-point correlation dynamics with @xmath195 ( for any theory we have investigated so far , and also in the present case ) become unstable at a certain point in time , when the absolute values of the equal - time functions suddenly start to rise steeply as a function of time .",
    "this does not seem to be a numerical effect , since the corresponding solutions remain unchanged if we use higher machine accuracies and smaller time step sizes . in the following we therefore focus on the time intervals where the solutions are still stable .",
    "we now i ) either leave out the zero momentum mode and initialize ( [ aaccmini])-([paccmini ] ) or ii ) include the zero momentum mode and initialize ( [ aameffini ] ) , ( [ ppmeffini ] ) , ( [ apccmini ] ) , and ( [ paccmini ] ) at @xmath196 and then numerically integrate the correlation dynamical equations , which conserve the total energy in time .",
    "[ bild1 ] shows the resulting electric field energy ( @xmath197 , @xmath198 ) @xmath199 as a function of time , where we have shifted the value at @xmath196 to zero .",
    "since @xmath200 is a gauge invariant operator , which is hermitean in the space of physical states , @xmath201 should be a real quantity .",
    "however , the figures in the right column show that within all approximation schemes ( first row : 2-point ; second row : 3-point ; third row : 4-point ) we obtain an imaginary part that is roughly as large as the real part .",
    "these oscillations of @xmath201 in the complex plane are due to a violation of gauge invariance , leading to a non - cancellation of the terms in ( [ partialintegrate ] ) that differentiate between the heisenberg and the schrdinger picture in the propagation of gauge dependent quantities .",
    "while it is clear that within the 2-point truncation scheme ( first row ) gauge invariance must be violated due to the neglect of the 3-point vertex , our calculation shows that within the 3- and 4-point truncation schemes ( second and third row ) , there is no significant improvement in this respect , which is partly due to a non - gauge invariant uv cutoff .",
    "one might argue that our initial conditions could also be a problem since they fulfill gauss law only in the abelian limit , i.e. while at @xmath196 the gauss law identities relating the 2- and 3-point functions are fulfilled , those relating the full 3- and 4-point functions are not .",
    "however , we have checked that by enforcing these identities at @xmath196 ( cf .",
    "the discussion in context with fig .",
    "[ bild6 ] ) , we obtain almost no visible effect on our results .",
    "some results concerning the infrared convergence are worth mentioning : fig .",
    "[ bild1 ] shows that within 2- and 4-point correlation dynamics ( first and third row ) the inclusion of the @xmath194 mode ( considering the 9 lowest lying momentum states ) leads to a significant reduction of the amplitudes of the oscillation as compared to a neglect of the @xmath194 mode ( considering the remaining 8 lowest lying momentum states ) ; in the 4-point case the amplitudes are reduced by almost one order of magnitude .",
    "in contrast to that , within 3-point correlation dynamics the inclusion of the zero momentum mode only leads to a significant increase of fast oscillations with comparably small amplitudes , mainly in the real part of @xmath201 , with frequencies given by the dynamics of the free field .",
    "the overall shape of the curves with respect to the slow , large amplitude oscillations  that violate gauge invariance  is almost unaffected by the inclusion or neglect of @xmath194 .",
    "this can be viewed as an indication of infrared convergence within the 3-point truncation scheme , whereas there is no infrared convergence on the 2- and 4-point level .    in fig .",
    "[ bild2 ] we display the transverse and longitudinal contributions to the real part of @xmath201 for the same calculation as in fig .  [ bild1 ] ; the left column shows the results with the @xmath194 mode not included , the right column contains those with the @xmath194 mode . within the 2-point truncation scheme ( first row )",
    "we see that without the zero mode , the oscillations almost entirely ( up to small deviations within linewidth ) show up in the longitudinal sector of the theory .",
    "the inclusion of the zero mode then leads to oscillations in the transverse sector as well .",
    "this , however , is merely due to the fact that with our prescription for the longitudinal projector at @xmath194 , the zero mode is by definition completely transverse ; the observed transverse oscillations are in fact entirely those of the zero mode . within 3-point correlation dynamics",
    "the inclusion of the zero momentum mode leaves the longitudinal sector almost unaffected and only leads to an increase of fast oscillations already mentioned in the discussion of fig .",
    "[ bild1 ] .",
    "these oscillations apparently only take place in the transverse sector ; a coupling between the transverse and the longitudinal sector only appears by generating an amplitude modulation for the fast , transverse oscillations ; the transverse modes are of almost no effect on the longitudinal modes . within 4-point correlation dynamics",
    "we observe a similar behaviour as in 2-point correlation dynamics , i.e.  slow oscillations of the zero mode appearing in the transverse sector , with an additional increase of fast transverse oscillations as observed in the 3-point truncation scheme .",
    "the violation of gauge invariance in the present approximation schemes can be seen directly by looking at the violation of the gauss law identities . the upper part of fig .",
    "[ bild3 ] shows the quantity @xmath202 , which is a measure for the violation of the corresponding identity between 2-point functions of the form @xmath203 and 3-point functions of the form @xmath204 ( cf .",

    "the calculations are the same as in figs .",
    "[ bild1 ] and [ bild2 ] with the zero momentum mode included .",
    "up to about @xmath205 , where the 3- and the 4-point approximation are still stable , all truncation schemes lead to a violation of roughly the same order of magnitude .",

    "both results clearly indicate that the problem with gauge invariance can not be cured by simply going to higher orders of correlation dynamics .      in order to gain a better understanding of the behaviour of the theory within correlation dynamics",
    ", we now turn to an investigation of the system for different values of the dimensionless coupling @xmath172 and for different numbers of plane wave states in the single particle basis .    in the left column of fig .",
    "[ bild4 ] we again display the real part of the electric field energy as a function of time , using the 21 lowest lying momentum states ( @xmath194 included ) , for 3 different values of @xmath172 . in each of the 3 approximation schemes , the curves for the different values of the coupling apparently ( up to the fast transverse oscillations in 3- and 4-point correlation dynamics , second and third row ) have the same shape and are only squeezed in the direction of the time axis and stretched in the direction of the amplitude axis .",
    "this indicates that in the longitudinal ( plus the zero mode ) sector the theory exhibits a scaling behaviour with respect to the coupling . in fact , the corresponding frequencies ( and amplitudes of dimension energy ) behave like @xmath208 as shown in the right column of fig .",
    "[ bild4 ] by rescaling all curves according to the scaling law @xmath209 which is a property of any system with a purely quartic coupling .",
    "this can be seen as follows : consider a hamiltonian of the form @xmath210 where this is meant as a purely formal notation with any indices or spacetime dependencies suppressed .",
    "one can now perform a canonical transformation according to @xmath211=[a ' , \\pi ' ] \\ ;   , \\label{canontrafo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which leads to @xmath212 and thus to a @xmath213 scaling of all eigenvalues of the hamiltonian .",

    "the fact that the @xmath213 scaling survives in 3- and 4-point correlation dynamics despite the inclusion of the 3-point vertex is , however , in line with the result obtained by lscher @xcite , that all eigenvalues of the ( purely discrete ) spectrum of yang - mills theory on a torus can be expanded in a power series of @xmath215 .    in order to investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the system as the uv cutoff",
    "is taken to infinity , the left column of fig .  [ bild5 ] again displays the real part of the electric field energy as a function of time for different numbers of momentum states that are taken into account . in the first row",
    "we have plotted the corresponding result within the 2-point truncation scheme and with the zero momentum mode excluded .",
    "all curves apparently have the same shape and are only squeezed or stretched with respect to each other along the two axes . in the right column we show the curves to obey the relation @xmath216 by rescaling them , where @xmath217 denotes the number of basis states taken into account ; as in the case of fig .",
    "[ bild4 ] the rescaled curves are all on top of each other .",

    "the same results are plotted within the 2-point truncation scheme and with the @xmath194 mode now included . while the frequencies still scale like @xmath218 as in ( [ basisscalinglaw ] ) , the @xmath219 scaling of the amplitude of @xmath201 is destroyed by the inclusion of the zero mode .    in the third row the corresponding results are shown in the 3-point approximation with the @xmath194 mode included ; we have chosen only to display the longitudinal part in order to get rid of the fast oscillations in the transverse sector . from figs .",
    "[ bild1 ] and [ bild2 ] we already know that the results are essentially identical in this case if the zero mode is excluded .",
    "the rescaling of the curves works reasonably well in the first half of the displayed time interval ; in the second half the application of ( [ basisscalinglaw ] ) while still `` going into the right direction '' does not lead to a really impressive agreement of the rescaled curves .",
    "furthermore , within the accuracy reached here , it only makes a small difference if in ( [ basisscalinglaw ] ) the zero mode is counted or not .",

    "we also recover the corresponding dependencies for the amplitudes .    the result that ( [ basisscalinglaw ] ) remains approximately valid in the 3-point truncation scheme indicates that , in contrast to the infrared behaviour , the cancellations required to guarantee that the theory is uv convergent do _ not _ take place .",
    "this is again a consequence of the violation of gauge invariance .",

    "we therefore now try to improve our approximation scheme by partly replacing our dynamical equations of motion by the constraint equations arising from gauss law ( cf .",
    "section [ gausshierarchy ] ) .",
    "there is of course no unique way to do this ; we implement gauss law by means of the replacement @xmath229 i.e. in an equal - time function that contains a longitudinal field momentum , the latter is commuted through to the right and the resulting @xmath1-point function is replaced by a sum over @xmath84-point functions according to ( [ gaussreplacement ] ) ( since we only use this prescription to replace 2- and 3-point functions , which possess no disconnected parts , we do not have to make the distiction between full and connected equal - time functions on the l.h.s . of ( [ gaussreplacement ] ) ) .",
    "this is done throughout the time integration and the remaining functions are propagated as before using the correlation dynamical equations of motion .",
    "of course ( [ gaussreplacement ] ) can not be applied for @xmath194 ; the gauss law for the zero mode , however , turns out to be fulfilled automatically within our investigation .",

    "we mention that whenever there is a green function containing more than one longitudinal field momentum , there is an ambiguity in the application of ( [ gaussreplacement ] ) . in case of the 2-point/3-point identities ,",
    "i.e. having a 2-point function containing two longitudinal momenta , this does not create any problem , since due to the symmetries of the system both ways for applying ( [ gaussreplacement ] ) lead to the same result . in case of the 3-point/4-point identities ,",
    "this is not the case and we choose to symmetrize between the various possibilities ; the stationary solution of our iteration scheme can then not exactly fulfill the corresponding identities . however , the remaining violation of the 3-point/4-point identities turns out to be very small compared to the original violation .",

    "since the total energy is given by @xmath233 , this result implies that the price we have to pay for our restoration of gauss law is the violation of energy conservation ; the reason for this is the replacement of the 2-point function containing two longitudinal momenta , which contributes to @xmath201 , by means of ( [ gaussreplacement ] ) .",
    "energy conservation can in principle be restored by instead using the corresponding 2-point/3-point identity to replace one of the 3-point functions ( these do not show up in the total energy ) .",

    "the remaining violation of the 2-point/3-point identities , which is then due to the 3-point truncation scheme , i.e. to the violation of higher order identities , is expected to be of a smaller effect on the time evolution than the original violation .",
    "we note in passing that it turns out not to have a significant effect if we also allow 3-point functions with 2 or 3 momenta larger than the 2-point cutoff , which is connected to the fact that the time derivatives of these 3-point functions then do not receive any contributions from the 3-point vertex term , which is the dominant nonabelian contribution ( cf .",

    "it is remarkable how insensitive the results shown in fig .",
    "[ bild11 ] are to the inclusion of gauss law identities especially in the early stages of the propagation .",
    "in yang - mills theory , as in any field theory , it is crucial to have a good approximation for the ground state of the theory . in this section",

    "the situation is even more complex , since in an equilibrium state only expectation values of gauge - invariant operators are stationary , and thus the task of finding the manifold of equilibrium solutions is significantly more involved than in one of the above non - gauge theories .    in our previous investigations",
    "@xcite , in order to avoid the difficulties associated with a variational calculation , we successfully resorted to the method of adiabatically switching on either the coupling or the residual interaction , starting from the free solution or a stationary hartree - fock - bogoliubov solution as initial condition , respectively .",
    "this method also has the advantage of requiring a significantly lower numerical effort than a variational calculation .",
    "however , in the following we will demonstrate that , at least within our approximation scheme , the method of adiabatically generating a ground state configuration encounters severe problems in the present case of @xmath0-dimensional su(2 ) yang - mills theory on a torus . in the @xmath0-dimensional continuum , without the presence of any regulators , it is obvious that the adiabatic method can not work , since the coupling is the only dimensionful parameter and therefore the system must exhibit a discontinuous transition to the abelian limit . even on a torus",
    "the theory can be shown to have such a discontinuous transition  in the framework of an implementation of a purely spatial axial gauge condition  due to the different numbers of independent zero modes for the gauss law constraint in the abelian and the nonabelian case @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , one could hope that in the presence of an additional infrared regulator ( such as leaving out the zero momentum mode ) , this behaviour might change . moreover , since the lowest energy state in the whole hilbert space should automatically fulfill gauss law @xcite , one could hope that in a possible adiabatic limit no additional difficulties arise by the fact that the propagation with a time dependent coupling , due to the induced explicit time dependence of the gauss law operator , does not conserve gauge invariance .",
    "we proceed by parameterizing the coupling time dependently according to @xmath248 and start from the perturbative initial condition given by ( [ aaccmini])-([paccmini ] ) .",
    "we exclude the zero mode , since at @xmath196 we have @xmath249 and therefore the effective zero mode mass ( [ effectivemass ] ) vanishes , and we are left with the original infrared singularity of the free photon propagator .",
    "if the adiabatic method would work , then in the limit @xmath250 the system should propagate along an adiabatic trajectory .    in order to investigate this",

    "all of the above results imply that the method of adiabatic switching does not work in the present case .    in order to get an explanation for this behaviour we consider the simple example of a quantum mechanical system described by the ( purely quartic ) time dependent hamiltonian @xmath253 suppose we have found a solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation for @xmath254 : @xmath255 \\psi_1(x , t)=0 \\ ; , \\label{a1solution}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and that we try to construct a corresponding solution for @xmath256 using the ansatz @xmath257 with @xmath258 defined by the canonical transformation @xmath259 inserting ( [ adiansatz ] ) into the time dependent schrdinger equations yields @xmath260 \\psi_\\alpha(x , t ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & = \\left [ i\\gamma \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\gamma t } - \\beta^{2/3 } \\left\\ { \\frac{p'^2}{2 } + \\left ( \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta } \\right)^2 t^2 \\frac{x'^4}{4 } \\right\\ } \\right ] \\psi_1(x',\\gamma t ) \\stackrel{!}{= } 0 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\rightarrow \\beta^{2/3 } \\left\\ { \\frac{p'^2}{2 } + \\left ( \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta } \\right)^2 t^2 \\frac{x'^4}{4 } \\right\\ } \\stackrel{!}{= }",

    "if the initial condition is chosen independent of @xmath251 , we furthermore have @xmath261 and thus our derivation only applies for the plane wave of momentum zero as initial condition , which is exactly what we have when starting with the unperturbed ground state . for plane waves with momenta @xmath262 our consideration does not rule out ( [ a25scalinglaw ] ) , since the wavefunctions can always pick up phases that cancel out in expectation values .",
    "it is a priori clear that for the above example the method of adiabatic switching can never work , because a non - normalizable scattering state ( e.g. , a plane wave ) can not be continuously transformed into a normalizable bound state of a quartic potential . for this simple example , it is easy to circumvent this problem by simply introducing a mass ( harmonic oscillator ) term , which is switched off adiabatically as the quartic coupling is switched on . in the case of yang - mills",
    "theory , however , the situation is different : both states , the unperturbed one and the perturbed one , are non - normalizable due to their invariance under abelian or nonabelian gauge transformations , respectively .",
    "therefore , the introduction of a mass term for the longitudinal yang - mills fields is no solution for the present problem since then the initial state would be a normalizable wave functional .",
    "the main results of this work concerning the investigation of the weak coupling ( small volume ) limit of su(2 ) yang - mills theory on a torus in @xmath0 spacetime dimensions can be summarized as follows :    *   the violation of gauss law within 2- , 3- , and 4-point correlation dynamics leads to large imaginary parts for the electric and magnetic field energies , which is clearly an unphysical result , whereas the total energy is conserved . *   the frequencies of the slow oscillations in the longitudinal sector of the theory scale like @xmath213 , as for a pure quartic oscillator . *   within 2- and 3-point correlation dynamics",
    "we also find the frequencies to scale like @xmath263 , as in a @xmath2-like theory described by a hamiltonian of the form @xmath264 .",
    "this result indicates that the cancellations necessary to ensure the ultraviolet finiteness of the theory do not occur on the 3-point level .",
    "this can also be attributed to the violation of gauge invariance . *   within the 3-point truncation scheme we find that the behaviour of the low frequency oscillations in the longitudinal sector is unaffected by the inclusion or exclusion of the zero momentum mode , which is an indication of infrared convergence . *   the modification of the 3-point truncation scheme by restoration of gauss law identities of different orders does not produce any change in the coupling or ultraviolet scaling behaviour of the system",
    "; it , however , leads to a reduction of the unphysical imaginary parts of the electric and magnetic field energies , but also to the violation of energy conservation . *   by taking into account an increased momentum basis for the 3-point functions we obtain similar results as for the restoration of gauss law identities alone ; the additional implementation of gauss law identities , while stabilizing the system , does not lead to a significant change in the behaviour of the electric and magnetic field energies especially in the early stages of the propagation . *",
    "the adiabatic generation of a perturbed ground state from the free ( abelian ) ground state turns out to be impossible due to a scaling behaviour similar to that of a pure quartic oscillator .",
    "we thus conclude that standard many - body techniques such as the connected green function approach in lower order ( up to the 4-point level ) , which are successful for the nuclear many - body problem and for @xmath2-theory , do not allow to compute the low - energy response of yang - mills systems , since either gauge invariance or the conservation of total energy is violated and since the uv divergences do not cancel out .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that , for all approximation schemes studied in this work , the necessary cancellations between the 3-point vertex terms and the hartree - fock - bogoliubov contribution to the 4-point - vertex terms ( the dressed tadpole ) do not occur .",
    "in this appendix we discuss a simple example , taken from ordinary quantum mechanics in @xmath4 spacetime dimensions , in order to present the essential features of the approach of section [ quantization ] to gauge fixing in the canonical formalism without having to deal with the complicated structure of yang - mills theory .",
