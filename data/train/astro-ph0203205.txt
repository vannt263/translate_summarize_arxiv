    "in the last few years , a new class of cosmological models has been proposed .",
    "the more usual cosmological constant @xmath1-term is replaced with a dynamical , time dependent component , the quintessence or dark energy , added together with baryons , cold dark matter ( cdm ) , photons and neutrinos .",
    "the equation of state of the dark energy is given by @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 being , respectively , the pressure and energy density ; since @xmath5 , it still implies a negative contribution to the total pressure of the cosmic fluid . when @xmath6 , we recover a constant @xmath1-term .",
    "one of the more interesting physical realizations of the quintessence is a cosmic scalar field minimally coupled with the usual matter action @xcite .",
    "such a field induces the repulsive gravitational force dynamically , allowing to explain the accelerated expansion of our universe , as discovered with observations of supernovae ( sne ) of type ia @xcite .",
    "together with an accelerated expansion , another experimental fact is the strong evidence of a spatially flat universe @xcite : quintessence could be responsible for the missing energy in a flat universe with a subcritical matter density .",
    "since quintessence drives the cosmological expansion at late times , it also influences the growth of structures arisen from gravitational instability .",
    "quintessence clusters gravitationally at very large scales ( @xmath7 mpc ) , leaving an imprint on the microwave backgroud anisotropy @xcite ; at small scales , fluctuations in the dark energy are damped and do not enter in the evolution equation for the perturbations in the pressureless matter @xcite . at the scale we are considering in the following ,",
    "quintessence behaves as a smooth component : it does not partecipate directly in cluster formation , but it only alters the background cosmic evolution .    in this work ,",
    "we study the evolution of density perturbations for a general exact solution for quintessence model , found by one of us together with p. scudellaro ( hereafter the rs model ) @xcite . in section 2",
    ", we present the basic equations of the quintessence models examined in the paper . in section 3",
    ", the linear perturbations equation is solved for the rs potential and the properties of the peculiar velocity field are discussed ; in section 4 , the 2dfgrs data are considered .",
    "section 5 is devoted to some final considerations .",
    "we investigate spatially flat , homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies filled with two non - interacting components : pressureless matter ( dust ) and a scalar field @xmath8 , minimally coupled with gravity .",
    "we consider the rs potential , @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "we refer to rubano & scudellaro @xcite and pavlov et al .",
    "@xcite for details and a discussion of the general exact solution of the field equations and we present here only what is needed for the present work .",
    "it is @xmath11 and @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a dimensionless time ; @xmath14 is a time scale of the order of the age of the universe ; @xmath15 is the time dependent hubble parameter ; @xmath16 is the pressureless matter density ( @xmath17 ) in units of the critical density @xmath18 .",
    "the relation between the dimensionless time @xmath19 and the redshift @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the present value of @xmath19 .",
    "this very simple cosmological model has two free parameters , @xmath14 and @xmath22 , or , equivalently , @xmath23 , the today value of the hubble parameter , and @xmath24 , the present value of the pressureless matter density . as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ scal3],[scal4 ] ) , @xmath24 depends only on @xmath22    we shall compare the results for the above universe with a flat model with constant equation of state @xmath25 ( as well known , this includes the @xmath1cdm cosmologies for @xmath26 ) . in this case , the redshift dependent hubble parameter is @xmath27 this class of models has three free parameters , @xmath24 , @xmath23 and @xmath25 .",
    "for perturbations inside the horizon , the equation describing the evolution of the cdm component density contrast , @xmath28 ( for unclustered quintessence ) is @xcite @xmath29 where the dot means derivative with respect to comoving time . in eq .",
    "( [ grow1 ] ) , the relative contribution of dark energy to the energy budget enters into the expansion rate @xmath15 .",
    "we shall consider eq .",
    "( [ grow1 ] ) in the matter dominated era , when the radiation contribution is really negligible .    with a rs potential , eq .",
    "( [ grow1 ] ) reduces to @xmath30 equation  ( [ grow2 ] ) has two linearly independent solutions , the growing mode @xmath31 and the decreasing mode @xmath32 , which can be expressed in terms of the hypergeometric function of second type @xmath33 .",
    "we get @xmath34,\\ ] ] and @xmath35.\\ ] ] by comparing eqs .",
    "( [ grow3],[grow4 ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ scal4 ] ) , we observe that the density contrast , as a function of the redshift , depends on only one parameter , @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath24 . for @xmath36 , eqs .",
    "( [ grow3],[grow4 ] ) reduce to the standard results @xmath37 and @xmath38 for the evolution of the density contrast for quintessence with constant equation of state , we refer to silveira and waga @xcite .",
    "the linear theory relates the peculiar velocity field @xmath39 and the density contrast by @xcite @xmath40 where the growth index @xmath41 is defined as @xmath42 @xmath43 is the scale factor , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is its present value . for a rs potential ,",
    "we get @xmath46 the growth index is usually approximated by @xmath47 . for @xmath1cdm models ,",
    "@xmath48 ; if @xmath49 , @xmath50 ; if @xmath51 , @xmath52 @xcite . in fig .  ( [ ln - f - ln - omega ] )",
    ", we show the logarithm of @xmath41 as a function of the logarithm of @xmath16 for the rs potential .",
    "the value @xmath53 provides a good approximation to the model .    in order to compare the various models",
    ", we have to stress that the  right \" value for @xmath24 depends on the model .",
    "it is the result of a best fit prodecure on experimental data , i.e. from sn ia observations .",
    "the well known value @xmath54 refers only to the @xmath1cdm model . with the same procedure applied to sne ia data",
    ", the rs potential gives @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "due to the large errors , the two results are still marginally compatible , so the value @xmath54 holds for the rs model too . in the case of a constant @xmath56 ,",
    "the situation is more complicate , due to the degeneration between @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite . in this preliminary study",
    ", we decided to consider only two situations : _",
    "i ) _ a @xmath1cdm , a @xmath56 and a rs model with @xmath57 ; _ ii ) _ the same three models with @xmath58 . as can be seen from fig .",
    "( [ f - z ] ) , a large variation in @xmath24 entails a remarkable difference in the growth index also at low redshifts .",
    "even more remarkable is the difference at large redshifts in the case of the same @xmath24 .",
    "this suggest that with the deep surveys planned in the future , this approach could provide a constraint independent of sne ia @xcite .    in fig .",
    "( [ deltaf - z ] ) , we show the relative variations of rs models from @xmath1cdm cosmologies . for models with the same @xmath24 ,",
    "the relative variations are quite small and decrease with increasing pressureless matter density . for @xmath59 ,",
    "the relative variation is @xmath60 ; for @xmath61 , it is @xmath62 .",
    "low redshifts have been investigated by the 2dfgrs collaboration @xcite .",
    "peculiar velocity distorts the correlation function of galaxies observed in redshift space @xcite . in linear theory",
    ", the characteristic quadrupole distortion enables to measure the growth index from redshift galaxy catalogs .",
    "the 2dfgrs has obtained redshifts for more than @xmath63 galaxies with an effective depth of @xmath64 . from a precise measurement of the clustering",
    ", a value of @xmath65 has been determined @xcite , where @xmath66 is the bias parameter , connecting the relative density fluctuations of the galaxies and of the total mass .",
    "the bias parameter has been measured by computing the bispectrum of the 2dfgrs ; it is @xmath67 @xcite . combining the measurements of @xmath68 and @xmath66 , the growth index at @xmath69",
    "can be estimated : it is @xmath70 @xcite . by using the rs potential , from this value of @xmath41",
    "we can obtain an estimate of the today pressureless matter density parameter .",
    "we get @xmath71 this value is significantly compatible with the estimate from the sn ia data .",
    "the present state of accuracy in observations does not allow to discriminate among the illustrated alternatives .    in our opinion",
    ", the above discussion adds another argument in favour of the use of exponential potentials in quintessence cosmology .",
    "the strong dependence of the growth index on the model , at high redshifts , suggests that more stringent constraints can be given in the future .",
