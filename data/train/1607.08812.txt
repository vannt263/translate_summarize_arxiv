    "matrix functions @xcite have emerged as an important mathematical tool for studying networks @xcite .",
    "the concepts of communicability @xcite , subgraph centrality @xcite ( see also @xcite for a review ) and katz index @xcite are derived from matrix functions @xmath0 of the adjacency matrix and allow the characterization of local structural properties of networks .",
    "the trace of @xmath0 , which is known as the estrada index of the graph @xcite , is a useful characterization of the global structure of a graph and it has found applications as an index of natural connectivity for studying robustness of networks @xcite .",
    "these initial studies have motivated more recent developments in the theory of graph - theoretic matrix function studies @xcite .",
    "all these indices have found multiple applications for studying real - world social , ecological , biological , infrastructural , and technological systems represented by networks @xcite . here",
    "we will use interchangeably the terms networks and graphs and will follow standard notation as in @xcite .",
    "the greatest appeal of the use of functions of the adjacency matrix for studying graphs is that when representing them in terms of a taylor function expansion : @xmath1 , the entries of the @xmath2th power of the adjacency matrix provides information about the number of walks of length @xmath2 between the corresponding pair of ( not necessarily different ) nodes ( see next section for formal definitions ) .",
    "then , the important ingredient of the definition of @xmath0 lies in the use of the coefficients @xmath3 .",
    "the use of @xmath4 gives rise to the exponential function of the adjacency matrix , which is the basis of the communicability / subgraph centrality . on the other hand ,",
    "selecting @xmath5 gives rise to the resolvent of the adjacency matrix , which is the basis of the katz centrality index @xcite .",
    "either of these two coefficients is selected arbitrarily among all the existing possibilities .",
    "however , they have proved to be very useful in practice and not very much improvement is obtained by changing the coefficients to account for bigger or smaller penalization of the walks according to their length @xcite .    here",
    "we propose to investigate the information contained in the mid part of the spectrum of the adjacency matrix of graphs and networks using a new adjacency matrix function .",
    "the adjacency matrix of a simple graph always contains positive and negative eigenvalues .",
    "then , we will refer here to the region close to the zero eigenvalue as the middle part of the spectrum .",
    "this is only truly the middle part in bipartite networks where the spectrum is symmetric , but we will use the term without loss of generality for any graph .",
    "this region of the spectrum is totally unexplored for complex networks .",
    "however , there are areas in which the zero eigenvalue plays a fundamental role . for instance , when the adjacency matrix represents the tight - binding hamiltonian in the hckel molecular orbital ( hmo ) method ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) , the zero eigenvalue and its multiplicity ( graph nullity ) represent important parameters related to the molecular stability and molecular magnetic properties ( see @xcite for a review ) . in these cases",
    "the highest occupied ( homo ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals ( lumo ) , which correspond to the smallest positive and the smallest negative eigenvalue of @xmath6 , respectively , play the most fundamental role in the chemical reactivity .",
    "it can be said that everything interesting in chemistry takes place with the involvement of the eigenvalues closest to zero .",
    "for instance , many chemical reactions and electron transfer complexes involve electron transfers between the homo of one molecule and the lumo of another @xcite .",
    "matrix functions of the type of @xmath1 are characterized by the fact that they give the highest weight to the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix . for a simple example",
    "let us consider the trace of @xmath7 of a simple , connected network , which can be written as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the order of the graph and @xmath10 are the eigenvalues of @xmath6 .",
    "it is clear that if the spectral gap of the adjacency matrix , @xmath11 , is very large , @xmath12 depends only of the largest eigenvalue @xmath13 .",
    "this is not a strange situation in real - world networks , where it is typical to find very large spectral gaps for their adjacency matrix . in these cases",
    "the use of functions of the type @xmath0 makes that the structural information contained in the smaller eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix is not captured by the index .",
    "a similar situation happens if we consider @xmath14 @xcite . in this case",
    "we give more weight to the smallest eigenvalue / eigenvector of the adjacency matrix and the information contained in the largest ones is again lost .    in this work",
    "we study a gaussian adjacency matrix function @xmath15 as a way to characterize the structural information of graphs giving more importance to the eigenvalues / eigenvectors in the middle part of the graph spectrum .",
    "similar gaussian operators may arise in quantum mechanics of many body systems @xcite as well as as the electronic partition function in renormalized tight binding hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "we start by proving some elementary results for some of the indices derived from @xmath15 for general graphs .",
    "in particular we study here properties of @xmath16 .",
    "we show that although the graph nullity  the multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the graph  plays an important role in the values of this index , the @xmath17 index contains more structural information than the graph nullity even for small simple graphs .",
    "we then prove that among the graphs with @xmath9 nodes , the maximum of the @xmath17 index is always obtained for the star graph followed by other complete bipartite graphs .",
    "then , we obtain analytic expressions for this index in random graphs with poisson and power - law degree distribution , showing that the last ones always display larger values of the @xmath17 index than the first ones . @xmath17 index normalized by the network size , @xmath18 .",
    "we found that the networks with the largest @xmath18 index correspond to those having relatively large bicliques ",
    "complete bipartite subgraphs , which can be created by different evolutionary mechanisms depending on the kind of complex system considered .",
    "although there are important network characteristics influencing the @xmath18 index , such as degree distribution and the degree assortativity , we show here that they are not unique in determining the high values of this index observed for certain networks . this new matrix function for graphs and networks may represent an important addition to the characterization of important properties of these systems which have remained unexplored due to the lack of characterizations of the middle region of graph spectra .",
    "let us introduce some definitions , notations , and properties associated with networks to make this work self - contained .",
    "we will use interchangeably the terms graphs and networks in this work .",
    "a _ graph _",
    "@xmath19 is defined by a set of @xmath9 nodes ( vertices ) @xmath20 and a set of @xmath21 edges @xmath22 between the nodes . here",
    "we will consider simple graphs without multiple edges , self - loops and direction of the edges .",
    "walk _ of length @xmath2 in @xmath23 is a set of nodes @xmath24 such that for all @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "a _ closed walk _ is a walk for which @xmath27 .",
    "a _ path _ is a walk with no repeated nodes .",
    "let @xmath6 be the adjacency operator on @xmath28 , namely @xmath29 . for simple finite graphs",
    "@xmath6 is the symmetric adjacency matrix of the graph , which has entries    @xmath30    the degree @xmath31 of the node @xmath32 is the number of edges incident to it , equivalently @xmath33 . in the particular case of an undirected network as the ones studied here , the associated adjacency matrix is symmetric , and thus its eigenvalues are real .",
    "we label the eigenvalues of @xmath6 in non - increasing order : @xmath34 .",
    "since @xmath6 is a real - valued , symmetric matrix , we can decompose @xmath6 into @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of @xmath6 and @xmath37 $ ] is orthogonal , where @xmath38 is an eigenvector associated with @xmath39 . because the graphs considered here are connected , @xmath6 is irreducible and from the perron - frobenius theorem we can deduce that @xmath40 and that the leading eigenvector @xmath41 , which will be sometimes referred to as the _ perron vector _ , can be chosen such that its components @xmath42 are positive for all @xmath43 .",
    "hereafter we will refer to the following function as the communicability function of the graph @xcite .",
    "let @xmath44 and @xmath45 be two nodes of @xmath46 .",
    "the communicability function between these two nodes is defined as    @xmath47    which is an important quantity for studying communication processes in networks .",
    "it counts the total number of walks starting at node @xmath44 and ending at node @xmath45 , weighted in decreasing order of their length by a factor @xmath48 ; therefore it is considering shorter walks more influential than longer ones .",
    "the @xmath49 terms of the communicability function characterize the degree of participation of a node in all subgraphs of the network , giving more weight to the smaller ones .",
    "thus , it is known as the subgraph centrality of the corresponding node @xcite .",
    "the following quantity is known in the algebraic graph theory literature as the estrada index of the graph :    @xmath50    which is a characterization of the global properties of a network . in its generalized form",
    "@xmath51 it represents the statistical - mechanics partition function of the graph where @xmath52 represents the inverse temperature .",
    "in some parts of this work we will consider the following integral    @xmath53{\\pi}{\\int}\\cos(\\gamma\\theta)\\exp(x\\cos\\theta)d\\theta-\\frac{\\sin(\\gamma\\pi)}{\\pi}\\stackrel[0]{\\infty}{\\int}\\exp(-x\\cosh t-\\gamma t)dt,\\ ] ]    which corresponds to the modified bessel function of the first kind .",
    "with the goal of accounting for the influence of the eigenvalues close to middle of the spectrum of the adjacency matrix of a graph , i.e. , those close to zero , we start here by introducing the following matrix function    @xmath54    by obvious reasons we will call it the _ gaussian matrix function _ of @xmath6 . let @xmath55 be the _ gaussian communicability function _ between the nodes @xmath56 and @xmath57 based on @xmath58 .",
    "that is , @xmath59    correspondingly , @xmath60 is the _",
    "gaussian subgraph centrality _ based on the same matrix function .",
    "the trace of @xmath61 will be designated by @xmath62    which corresponds to the _ gaussian estrada index _ of the graph .",
    "it is very important to mention that for calculating the index @xmath17 we do not need to obtain explicitly the exponential matrix of @xmath58 .",
    "we are not interested here in the development of such kind of techniques but the reader is directed to the excellent work of benzi and boito @xcite for a discussion of efficient techniques for estimating the trace of an exponential matrix that do not require computing every entry of the matrix exponential.    obviously , using the spectral decomposition of the adjacency matrix we can express both indices as    @xmath63    @xmath64    let @xmath65 be the nullity of the adjacency matrix @xmath6 , i.e. , the dimension of the null space of @xmath6 . in spectral graph theory @xmath66 is known as the _ graph nullity_. then , it is obvious that the @xmath17 index is related to @xmath67 as follows :    @xmath68    with both indices identical if and only if @xmath69 , for all @xmath70 , which is attained only for the trivial graph , i.e. , the graph with @xmath9 nodes and no edges .",
    "indeed ,    @xmath71    then , it is interesting at least empirically , to explore the relation between @xmath17 and @xmath67 for simple graphs .",
    "we investigate all the connected graphs with @xmath72 for which we obtain both @xmath17 and @xmath67 .",
    "the correlation between both indices for the 11,117 connected graphs with 8 nodes is illustrated in figure ( [ general correlations ] ) .",
    "although the correlation is statistically significant  the pearson correlation coefficient is 0.74it hides the important differences between the two indices .",
    "for instance , there are 5,724 graphs with zero nullity among all the connected graphs with 8 nodes . for these graphs @xmath73 , which represents a wide range of values taking into account that the minimum and maximum values of @xmath17 for all connected graphs with 8 nodes are 1.484 and 6 , respectively .",
    "it is also easy to see that there are graphs having nullity zero which have larger @xmath17 indices than some graphs having nullity one , two or three .",
    "the results are very similar for @xmath74 and they are not shown here . in the figure ( [ general correlations ] ) we show the graphs with the largest @xmath17 indices among all connected graphs with 8 nodes and nullity zero or one .",
    "these graphs show a common pattern containing several complete bipartite subgraphs .",
    "for instance , every yellow node in the figure ( [ general correlations ] ) is connected to every red ones , every red is connected to every blue and every blue is connected to the green one , while there is no yellow - yellow , red - red or blue - blue connections .",
    "this pattern will be revealed when we study the mathematical properties of this index and its importance will be analyzed for real - world networks .",

    "then , new nodes are added to the network in such a way that each new node is connected to the existing ones with a probability that is proportional to the degree of these existing nodes .",
    "while the erds - rnyi @xmath205 random graphs have a poisson degree distribution ( when @xmath146 ) , the barabsi - albert ones show power - law degree distribution of the form : @xmath207where @xmath208 is the probability of finding a node with degree @xmath2 .",
    "in term of their spectra the main difference is that er graphs display the wigner semi - circle distribution @xcite of eigenvalues when @xmath146 of the form    @xmath209    where @xmath210 .",
    "however , the ba networks have a triangular distribution @xcite of eigenvalues of the form    @xmath211    using these distributions we obtain the following results .    for an erds - rnyi random graph @xmath212 with @xmath213 we have @xmath214    almost surely , as @xmath146 , where @xmath210 and @xmath215 is the modified bessel function of the first kind .",
    "we know that the spectral density of @xmath212 converges to the semicircular distribution ( [ eq : semicircle ] ) as @xmath146 .",

    "the behavior is more complex as there is a crossing point between the two curves .",
    "this difference between the behavior of the theoretical function ( [ eq : h(ba ) ] ) for low and large densities of the graphs may be due to the fact that the eigenvalue distribution of the ba networks is different at these two density regimes . according to our computational experiments ,",
    "it is only true that the ba networks display triangular eigenvalue distributions for relatively small edge densities and deformations of it occurs for larger densities , which may produce the observed deviations from the theoretical and computational results .",

[ table-1.-dataset ]    the largest value of @xmath18 corresponds to the food web of bridge brooks , which displays the second highest normalized nullity .",
    "it is followed by the transcription network of yeast ( displaying the highest value of the normalized nullity ) and the versions of internet at autonomous system ( as ) of 1997 and 1998 .",
    "the three networks display triangular eigenvalue distributions peaked at the zero eigenvalue which explains their large values of the @xmath18 index .",
    "however , while the yeast transcription network and the internet at as have fat - tailed degree distributions , the bridge brooks food web displays a uniform one .",
    "thus , the existence of large values of the @xmath18 index is not tied up to the existence of fat - tailed degree distributions .",
    "most of the networks ( 75.4% ) have values of the @xmath18 index below 0.5 .",
    "that is , only 15 networks out of 61 have @xmath234 . among these 15 networks",
    "there are 4 of the 7 protein - protein interaction networks ( pins ) studied and two of the three transcription networks studied .",
    "thus , almost half of the networks with @xmath234 represent biological systems containing proteomic or transcriptomic information .",
    "the other transcription network studied has @xmath235 and the other 3 pins have values of @xmath18 ranging between 0.36 and 0.44 .",
    "it is interesting to explore the main structural causes for these high values of the @xmath18 index . in previous sections",
    "we have found that the main structural characteristic determining the high values of this index is the presence of bicliques , e.g. the highest value of @xmath18 is obtained for complete bipartite graphs , also the ba networks display larger @xmath18 index that the er ones due to the presence of complete bipartite subgraphs created during the evolution of the preferential attachment mechanism .",
    "consequently , we should expect that such kind of subgraphs appear in those real - world networks having the largest @xmath18 index . in the case of the food web of bridge",
    "brook we have found a biclique consisting of two sets of nodes @xmath130 and @xmath131with cardinalities of 6 and 35 nodes , respectively .",
    "this subgraph represents a biclique @xmath236 which contains 55% of the total number of nodes in the network .",
    "there are also other smaller bicliques in this network , which together with the @xmath236 contribute to the large @xmath18 value observed . in the cases of the yeast transcription network and the internet at",
    "as , the networks are characterized by having a few hubs connected to many nodes of degree one , then producing bicliques of the type @xmath237 in general these findings can be understood on the basis of different mechanisms which give rise to the existence of bicliques in real - world networks .",
    "for instance , in some food webs there are top predators which compete for a group of preys .",
    "if for this group of species there are no prey - prey nor predator - predator trophic interactions , the corresponding subgraph is a biclique as the one observed for the bridge brook network previously considered . in the cases of transcription and pins the bicliques can be formed as a consequence of lock - and - key kind of interaction .",
    "that is , a group of proteins ( genes ) can act as locks ( activators ) that physically interact with other proteins ( activate other genes ) acting as keys .",
    "such kind of interactions is prone to produce relatively large bicliques in the structure of the networks resulting from them .",
    "on the other hand , among the networks with @xmath238 we find the network of corporate directors , the three neuronal networks studied , i.e. , macaque and cat visual cortex and the neuronal network of _ c. elegans _ , as well as some social networks and food webs . also , the three electronic circuits studied here also display values of @xmath18 index around 0.3 .",
    "these networks are characterized by the lack of complete bipartite subgraphs and they may represent a variety of topologies difficult to be reproduced by a single mechanism .    finally we would like to remark a few important characteristics of the gaussian matrix function of a network that point out to the necessity of further studies of it for real - world networks and simple graphs in general .",
    "the first , is our observation that although networks with fat - tailed degree distribution may give rise to high values of the @xmath18 index , it is not a necessary condition for a network to display such a characteristic .",
    "we have seen that networks with exponential and even uniform degree distributions display large values of the @xmath18 index .",
    "another structural parameter that could be related to the @xmath18 index is the degree assortativity , i.e. , the pearson correlation coefficient of the degree - degree distribution of a network .",
    "we have explored such relation between the @xmath18 index and the assortativity for the 61 networks studied here .",
    "we have found that the two parameters are negatively correlated .",
    "that is , high values of the @xmath18 index in general implies that the networks are disassortative , i.e. , there is a trend of high degree nodes to be connected to low degree ones .",
    "this is understandable on the basis of our findings that bicliques of the type @xmath239 plays a fundamental role in the value of the @xmath18 index .",
    "however , the correlation is very weak and displays a pearson correlation coefficient of -0.68 .",
    "thus , further explorations  both theoretical and computational  of the relation of the @xmath18 index and other network parameters are necessary for a complete understanding of this index and its application in network theory .",
    "most of the works using matrix functions for studying graphs are concentrated on the use of the exponential and the resolvent of the adjacency matrix of the graph .",
    "other functions such as the hyperbolic sine and cosine , and @xmath240-matrix functions have also been reported .",
    "all these matrix functions give more weight to the largest eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector of the adjacency matrix than to the rest of eigenvalues / eigenvectors . in many real - world networks , where the spectral gap is relatively large , this situation gives rise to discarding important structural information contained in the eigenvalues close to zero in the graph spectra .",
    "here , we have studied a gaussian matrix function which accounts for the information contained in the eigenvalues / eigenvectors close to zero in the graph spectra .",
    "we have shown that such information is related to the existence of important structural patterns in graphs which have remained unexplored when studying the structure of complex networks , such as the existence of relatively large complete bipartite subgraphs ( bicliques ) .",
    "such bicliques appear naturally in many real - world networks as well as in the barabsi - albert graphs and other networks with fat - tailed degree distributions . in this work",
    "we have concentrated in the theoretical characterization of the networks displaying the largest gaussian estrada index ",
    "an index characterizing the importance of eigenvalues close to zero .",
    "other extensions to give more weight to other specific eigenvalues / eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix are under development .",
    "we hope this work will open new research interest in the study of matrix functions for the structural characterization of graphs .",
