    "although the drive signal is applied to the rf rods , indirect coupling of the drive to the axial motion of the ion is sufficient to excite axial modes .",
    "the exact axial secular frequency depends on which trap electrodes are used as endcaps and what voltage is applied to them , but it is typically between 15 hz and 30 hz .",
    "the transverse secular frequencies are of more interest because they depend directly on the trap geometry : the geometric factor @xmath137 in eq .",

    "the large spread in the @xmath81 distribution does not allow for the determination of the geometric factor for each trap separately .",
    "however , we can measure the ratio of the geometric factors of the traps by first measuring @xmath138 of an ion in the planar trap , then applying a sequence of voltages on the control electrodes to move that ion into the four rod trap , where @xmath138 is measured again . by doing several experiments of this kind , we determined the geometric factor ratio to be @xmath144 .",

    "the shuttling shown was performed by raising the potential of the nearest control electrode to the ion . in this case , the speed of the ion and its final position are determined both by the electrode potential and the drag force on the ion . figure  [ fig : ionspeed ] shows how the maximum speed the ion achieves during its motion depends on these two parameters .",

    "typically , an electrode between the ions is raised to 5 v for separation and lowered back to 0 v to join them again . for performing two qubit gates with atomic ions , it is desirable to bring the ions as close to each other as possible , because gates are fastest when the frequencies of the two axial normal modes of the ions are well separated  @xcite . in that case ,",

    "we have used the following pulse sequence to do that : ( 1 ) lower the center electrode of the destination arm to -2 v , then ( 2 ) raise a control electrode in the source arm to 5 v to push the ion over the hill in the source arm .",

    "in addition to the cross trap described in this paper , designs under investigation have as many as 100 zones and include corners , three way junctions , and four way junctions .",

    "one can place dc electrodes at arbitrary positions defining a planar point trap at each position .",

    "we have addressed the challenges of ion loading and ion motion given the smaller relative trap depth of planar traps .",
    "the challenge of loading ions into the planar trap was solved by coupling a traditional four rod trap to a planar trap .",
    "ions at high kinetic energy were first loaded into the linear trap and then offloaded onto the planar trap .",
    "this method allows us to load the planar trap with the efficiency of loading a traditional linear trap .",
    "furthermore , we have found that the addition of a charged conductive plane above the trap can be used to increase the trap depth . in the atomic case the ions will be initally loaded at a position of high micromotion limiting the effect of laser cooling . in our design example",
    "this micromotion has an amplitude of @xmath153 when the potential on the top plane is such that the trap depth is increased by a factor of 10 .",
    "however , after initial trapping the micromotion can be minimized and the cooling maximized simply by grounding the conductive plane .    controlled movement of the ions in the planar trap was accomplished despite the small trap depth . using increasingly complex traps ,",
    "we have been able to perform all the fundamental movement operations required in a multi - zone architecture : splitting and joining ion chains and moving ions around corners and through four way intersections . before this work ,",
    "ion movement through a four way intersection was predicted to not be possible .",
