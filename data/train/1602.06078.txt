    "see @xcite for an introduction to the theory of harmonic polynomials .",
    "a classical reference for problem ( [ ste ] ) is @xcite .",
    "for a recent survey paper , we refer to @xcite ; see also @xcite , @xcite for related problems .",
    "it is well - known that for @xmath15 , problem ( [ ste ] ) provides the vibration modes of a free elastic membrane the total mass of which is @xmath16 and is concentrated at the boundary with density @xmath17 ; see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "as is pointed out in @xcite , such a boundary concentration phenomenon can be explained in any dimension @xmath2 as follows .    for any @xmath18",
    ", we define a ` mass density ' @xmath19 in the whole of @xmath0 by setting    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the measure of the unit ball .",
    "note that for any @xmath22 we have @xmath23 as @xmath24 , and @xmath25 for all @xmath26 , which means that the ` total mass ' m is fixed and concentrates at the boundary of @xmath0 as @xmath24 .",
    "then we consider the following eigenvalue problem for the laplace operator with neumann boundary conditions @xmath27 we recall that for @xmath15 problem ( [ neu ] ) provides the vibration modes of a free elastic membrane with mass density @xmath28 and total mass @xmath16 ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the eigenvalues of ( [ neu ] ) have finite multiplicity and form a sequence @xmath29 depending on @xmath30 , with @xmath31 .",
    "it is not difficult to prove that for any @xmath32 @xmath33 see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite for a detailed analysis of the analogue problem for the biharmonic operator . )",
    "thus the steklov problem can be considered as a limiting neumann problem where the mass is concentrated at the boundary of the domain .    in this paper",
    "we study the asymptotic behavior of @xmath34 as @xmath35 .",
    "namely , we prove that such eigenvalues are continuously differentiable with respect to @xmath30 for @xmath36 small enough , and that the following formula holds @xmath37 in particular , for @xmath38 , @xmath39 hence @xmath40 is strictly increasing and the steklov eigenvalues @xmath11 minimize the neumann eigenvalues @xmath34 for @xmath41 small enough .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results with those in @xcite , where authors consider the neumann laplacian in the annulus @xmath42 and prove that for @xmath15 the first positive eigenvalue is a decreasing function of @xmath30 .",
    "we note that our analysis concerns all eigenvalues @xmath11 with arbitrary indexes and multiplicity , and that we do not prove global monotonocity of @xmath34 , which in fact does not hold for any @xmath12 ; see figures [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] .",
    "the proof of our results relies on the use of bessel functions which allows to recast problem ( [ neu ] ) in the form of an equation @xmath43 in the unknowns @xmath44 .",
    "then , after some preparatory work , it is possible to apply the implicit function theorem and conclude .",
    "we note that , despite the idea of the proof is rather simple and used also in other contexts ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , the rigorous application of this method requires lenghty computations , suitable taylor s expansions and estimates for the corresponding remainders , as well as recursive formulas for the cross - products of bessel functions and their derivatives .",
    "importantly , the multiplicity of the eigenvalues which is often an obstruction in the application of standard asymptotic analysis , does not affect our method .",
    "we note that if the ball @xmath0 is replaced by a general bounded smooth domain @xmath45 , the convergence of the neumann eigenvalues to the steklov eigenvalues when the mass concentrates in a neighborhood of @xmath46 still holds . however , the explicit computation of the appropriate formula generalizing ( [ intro2 ] ) is not easy and requires a completely different technique which will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we also note that an asymptotic analysis of similar but different problems is contained in @xcite , where by the way explicit computations of the coefficients in the asymptotic expansions of the eigenvalues are not provided .    it would be interesting to investigate the monotonicity properties of the neumann eigenvalues in the case of more general families of mass densities @xmath19 .",
    "however , we believe that it would be difficult to adapt our method ( which is based on explicit representation formulas ) even in the case of radial mass densities ( note that if @xmath19 is not radial one could obtain a limiting steklov - type problem with non - constant mass density , see @xcite for a general discussion ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the proof of formula ( [ intro2 ] ) is discussed in section [ sec:2 ] . in particular , subsection [ sec:3 ]",
    "is devoted to certain technical estimates which are necessary for the rigorous justification of our arguments . in subsection [ sec:4 ]",
    "we consider also the case @xmath47 and prove formula ( [ intro2 ] ) for @xmath48 which , by the way , is the only non zero eigenvalue of the one dimensional steklov problem . in appendix",
    "we establish the required recursive formulas for the cross - products of bessel functions and their derivatives which are deduced by the standard formulas available in the literature .",

    "@xmath88 is a linear combination of the functions @xmath91 and @xmath92 . on the other hand ,",
    "the solutions of ( [ angular ] ) are the spherical harmonics of order @xmath12 . then @xmath5 can be written as in ( [ r ] ) for suitable values of @xmath93 .",
    "now we compute the coefficients @xmath73 and @xmath74 in ( [ r ] ) .",
    "since the right - hand side of the equation in ( [ neu ] ) is a function in @xmath94 then by standard regularity theory a solution @xmath5 of ( [ neu ] ) belongs to the standard sobolev space @xmath95 , hence @xmath73 and @xmath74 must be chosen in such a way that @xmath5 and @xmath96 are continuous at @xmath97 , that is @xmath98 solving the system we obtain    @xmath99    note that @xmath100 is the wronskian in @xmath61 , which is known to be @xmath101 ( see @xcite ) .",
