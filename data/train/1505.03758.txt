    "it was recently pointed out by a spectrum usage survey from the federal communications commission ( fcc ) , that the current licensed spectrum situation is significantly under - utilized @xcite .",
    "contrary to that , the current availability of spectrum resources for most emerging wireless applications such as video calling , online high - definition video streaming , high - speed internet access through mobile devices , etc .",
    "are particularly scarce . in an attempt to improve the spectrum utilization in wireless communication systems , cognitive radio ( cr ) technology",
    "was proposed as a promising technology @xcite . in cognitive radio , secondary users - sus ( or unlicensed users )",
    "are generally allowed to use the licensed band primarily allotted to primary users - pus ( or licensed users ) , unless their operation interferes with the established communication of pus .",
    "this operation can be realized in three distinctive modes : underlay , overlay and interweave @xcite . in the underlay mode ,",
    "sus are allowed to use the spectrum when the interference caused by sus on pus is within a tolerated range by pus .",
    "this mode is more preferable than its two counterparts thanks to its low implementation complexity @xcite .    due to the interference power constraint imposed on sus operating in the underlay mode ,",
    "their transmit power is limited and as such , their transmission range is reduced substantially . to overcome this constraint , sus can apply relaying techniques , which take advantage of shorter range communication that results to lower path loss effects . among various relaying techniques ,",
    "decode - and - forward ( df ) and amplify - and - forward ( af ) deployments have been extensively investigated @xcite . in df , each relay decodes information from the source , re - encodes it , and forwards it to the destination . in af , each relay simply amplifies the received signal and forwards it to the destination . due to its capability of regenerating noise - free relayed signals ,",
    "df is employed in this paper .",
    "it is also widely known that fading affects significantly the performance of wireless systems @xcite and the references therein .",
    "this paper investigates underlay df multi - hop cognitive networks with arbitrary number of hops .",
    "most relevant works considering such network deployments focus in outage probability analysis @xcite , @xcite , and ber analysis @xcite assuming perfect channel estimation and two - hop communication .",
    "it is also recalled here that channel state information ( csi ) is essential for coherent detection ; nevertheless , existing channel estimators are unable to provide and guarantee perfect csi . as a consequence",
    ", the impact of imperfect csi on the system performance should be considered realistically .    in @xcite , the ber analysis for _ single - hop _ cognitive networks is presented under the assumption of imperfect csi only for su - pu links . in @xcite , an exact outage probability expression was proposed for _ af dual - hop _ cognitive networks . however , to the best of our knowledge , the exact ber analysis for underlay _",
    "df @xmath0-hop _ cognitive networks , with @xmath0 being arbitrary integer , and imperfect csi on all wireless channels , has not been addressed in the open technical literature .",
    "motivated by this , this paper is devoted to an analytic investigation of this topic by deriving a corresponding exact closed - form ber expression .",
    "the derived expression is validated by extensive computer simulations and is utilized in evaluating the corresponding system performance .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : the next section presents the system model and the csi imperfection model .",
    "the ber analysis is discussed in section [ sec : perana ] while simulated and analytical results are presented in section [ illustrativeresults ] for derivation validity and performance evaluation .",
    "finally , the paper is concluded in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "the underlay cognitive df multi - hop network model under consideration is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_sm ] , where @xmath1 secondary relays ( srs ) numbered from 1 to @xmath1 assist the transmission of the secondary source ( ss ) 0 to the secondary destination ( sd ) @xmath0 .",
    "the ss and srs use the same spectrum as a primary user p. the direct communication between ss and sd is bypassed , which is considered reasonable in scenarios where ss and sd are too far apart or their communication link is blocked due to severe shadowing and fading .",
    "we assume that the channel between any pair of transmitter and receiver experiences independent block frequency - flat rayleigh fading i.e. , frequency - flat fading is invariant during one phase but independently changed from one to another .",
    "therefore , the channel coefficient between the transmitter @xmath2 and the receiver @xmath3 is @xmath4 , denotes an @xmath5-mean circular symmetric complex gaussian random variable with variance @xmath6 . ] where @xmath7 is the distance between the two terminals and @xmath8 is the path - loss exponent @xcite .",
    "an @xmath0-hop communication time interval consists of @xmath0 phases . in the first phase",
    ", ss 0 transmits a sequence of @xmath9 modulated symbols @xmath10 $ ] with the symbol energy , @xmath11 i.e. , @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the expectation and @xmath14 is the time index .",
    "sr 1 demodulates the received signal from ss 0 and re - modulates the demodulated symbol as @xmath15 $ ] with the symbol energy , @xmath16 , before forwarding to sr 2 in the second phase .",
    "the process continues until the signal reaches sd @xmath0 . without the notation confusion ,",
    "the time index is omitted in the sequel and hence , the received signal through the hop @xmath17 can be expressed as    @xmath18    where @xmath19 denotes a signal received at the node @xmath17 from the node @xmath20 and @xmath21 is additive white gaussian noise at the node @xmath17 .    in the underlay relay cognitive networks ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) ,",
    "the su @xmath22 s transmit power is limited such that the interference imposed on pu is under control . without csi errors ,",
    "this interference constraint can be addressed as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the maximum interference level that pu still operates reliably . for the maximum transmission range , @xmath25 is set .",
    "following @xcite , we choose the csi imperfection model as    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the estimate of the @xmath28 channel and @xmath29 is the csi error .",
    "we assume that @xmath30 and @xmath27 are jointly ergodic and stationary gaussian processes . therefore , @xmath31 and @xmath32 with @xmath33 representing the quality of the channel estimator .",
    "for example @xcite , for the linear - minimum - mean - square - error ( lmmse ) estimator , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the number of pilot symbols , @xmath36 is the average snr of pilot symbols for the @xmath28 channel , and @xmath37 is the pilot power .",
    "due to csi errors , the transmit power of the node @xmath22 is modified as @xmath38",
    ". then , there are two possibilities : @xmath39 and @xmath40 meets the interference power constraint for @xmath41 , since this case results in the interference power as @xmath42 , but not for @xmath43 , since this case results in the interference power as @xmath44 . given that @xmath45 where the equality holds for no csi errors , on average such transmit power setting may not meet the interference power constraint i.e.",
    ", the interference at p is greater than @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , the primary system performance may be severely degraded if the channel estimator is not efficient .",
    "consequently , in order to propose solutions to interference reduction on primary systems , statistics of interference at the pu receiver should be analyzed .",
    "the most important statistics is the probability that the interference exceeds @xmath24 , namely the interference probability @xmath46 as used in @xcite .",
    "it is noted that @xmath46 is derived for underlay _ af _ _ dual - hop _ cognitive networks @xcite and for underlay _ single - hop _ cognitive networks @xcite with the csi imperfection model slightly different where @xmath47 is the correlation coefficient between @xmath48 and @xmath30 . ] . due to the space limitation ,",
    "the interference probability analysis is deferred to the journal version of this paper .",
    "instead , we focus on the ber analysis for underlay relay cognitive networks . to this effect , using the csi imperfection model in ( [ h_tr ] ) , we rewrite ( [ y_r ] ) as ,    @xmath49    according to ( [ y_tr1 ] ) , the effective snr of the @xmath28 channel taking csi errors into account is expressed as ,    @xmath50    where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .    the average ber at the node @xmath17 for square @xmath54-qam with @xmath55 ( @xmath56 even ) and rectangular @xmath54-qam with @xmath55 ( @xmath56 odd ) modulation schemes - psk can be derived in the same approach . ]",

    "it is seen that analytical results are well matched with simulated ones , validating the derived expression .",
    "additionally , the ber performance is improved with respect to the increase in @xmath24 .",
    "this is obvious since @xmath24 imposes a constraint on the transmit power and the higher @xmath24 , the higher the transmit power , eventually enhancing communication reliability .",
    "moreover , the ber performance is deteriorated with the lack of csi .    fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] investigates the impact of the quality of the channel estimator on the ber .",
    "the quality of the channel estimator can be enhanced by increasing the number of pilot symbols @xmath35 at the cost of the bandwidth loss due to increased overhead .",
    "the results are reasonable since the ber performance is improved with the increased @xmath35 . furthermore , for the selected channel estimator model , the performance is saturated at @xmath96 .    given the specific network topology in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim ] , the results in figs .  [ figure12qam ] ,  [ figure14qam ] , and  [ fig:2 ] illustrate that 3-hop communication is worst than 2-hop communication for any set @xmath97 .",
    "this means that in underlay df multi - hop cognitive networks the advantage of the 3-hop communication over 2-hop communication in terms of the path loss reduction , e.g. , the distance from the last relay to the destination in the 3-hop case ( sr 2 ) is smaller than that in the 2-hop case ( sr 1 ) , can not sometimes turn into the performance improvement .",
    "this is because the last relay in the 3-hop case is closer to the primary user than in the 2-hop case , causing higher interference .",
    "thus , the last relay in the 3-hop case should utilize lower transmit power than in the 2-hop case for reducing the interference level to the primary user , leading to higher performance degradation .",
    "these results recommend that the relay selection in underlay df multi - hop cognitive networks is crucial in enhancing the network performance . a good relay not only provides reliable communication to the destination but also causes less interference to the primary user . the problem of the relay selection will be considered in a future work .",
    "this paper investigated analytically the ber performance of underlay df multi - hop cognitive networks over rayleigh fading channel in consideration of imperfect csi .",
    "the derived expression was shown to have a convenient algebraic form which allows straightforward to timely evaluation of the corresponding performance .",
    "the proposed analytical results were supported and validated with results from computer simulations while various results demonstrated that the imperfect csi affects significantly the ber of underlay df multi - hop cognitive networks .",
    "in addition , it was shown that the ber performance is dependent upon both the number of hops and the network topology .",
