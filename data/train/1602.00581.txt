    "<S> , we find that for an anisotropic bianchi type i universe , it transits from a high anisotropy stage to a more homogeneous stage in the near past . using the normal entropy given by gibbs law of thermodynamics , it is proved that the generalized second law of thermodynamics does not always satisfied throughout the history of the universe when we assume the universe is enclosed by the generalized ricci scalar radius @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it becomes invalid in the near past to the future , and the formation of the galaxies will be helpful in explaining such phenomenon , for that the galaxies s formation is an entropy increase process . </S>",
    "<S> the negative change rates of the horizon entropy and internal entropy occur in different period indicates that the influences of galaxies formation is wiped from internal to the universe s horizon .    </S>",
