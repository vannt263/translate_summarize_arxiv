    "flow separation at the dune brink due to the strong local curvature of the surface gives rise to a zone of recirculating flow @xcite , which can not be described by the analytical model @xcite .",
    "this problem is overcome introducing the so - called `` separation bubble '' : for each longitudinal slice of the dune , a separation streamline connecting the brink to the reattachment point is introduced at the lee .",
    "each separation streamline is fitted to a third - order polynomial , the parameters of which are determined as described in detail by @xcite .",
    "the wind model @xcite is then solved for the smooth `` envelope '' that comprises the separation bubble and the dune surface @xcite .",

    "when the wind shear stress exceeds a minimal threshold and saltation begins , the sand flux first grows exponentially due to the multiplicative process inherent to the saltation process .",

    "the outcome of the calculation is a two - dimensional field ( @xmath44 ) ) that gives the height - integrated , average mass flux of saltating particles over the terrain .",
    "finally , mass conservation is used in order to compute the evolution of the local height ( @xmath45 ) through the equation , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the bulk sand density .",

    "we note that this choice for @xmath60 is fairly consistent with measurements of drift rates by @xcite in the jafurah sand sea in saudi arabia .",

    "as the barchan approaches the ridge , deposition occurs at the lee of the ridge , on the side corresponding to the closest limb .",
    "this limb then elongates once it arrives at the lee of the obstacle .",
    "the taller the ridge , the more accentuated the extension .",
    "as the other limb approaches sufficiently close to the ridge , a similar process occurs and thus that limb also elongates .",
    "the deposition at the ridge s lee occurs due to a decrease in wind strength just downwind of the crest .",
    "when the sand released through the limbs crosses the ridge s crest , it can not escape the lee since the transport rate there is reduced .",
    "as the dune advances and more limb sand is deposited , the wind strength at the lee suffices to extend the limb , yet accumulation ensues .",
    "thus , from the sand released through this limb , a sand patch forms downwind of the ridge s crest ( second frame from left to right ) , which develops into an elongated limb ( cf .",
    "third and fourth frames ) .",
    "then , in the fifth frame , the left limb is crossing the ridge s crest which also leads to a sand patch in the ridge s wake .",
    "this process causes , then , elongation of the left limb as we can see in the subsequent frame .",
    "it is interesting to note that in fig .",
    "[ fig : topographic_raise]a not all barchans elongate the same limb .",
    "for instance , some barchans which have the right ( left ) limb elongated are upwind ( downwind ) of the ridge s crest , which is in agreement with the prediction of fig .",
    "[ fig : topographic_raise]c as discussed above .",
    "however , this behavior can be explained only if we assume that the dunes are well isolated from each other ( i.e. they are not participating at a collision ) .",
    "for instance , the dune shape in the most lower right of fig .",
    "[ fig : topographic_raise]a , which seems to result from a collision between dunes , has limbs of nearly equal size .",
    "furthermore , the dune on the most lower left has an elongated arm opposite to that of the example barchan with the black box drawn around it .",
    "however , the elongated arm of the lower left dune too has a slip face  possibly indicating that this dune too is being affected by a collision .",
    "therefore , application of our results to the field should be made with care , since we did not account for the effect of dune collisions or influx asymmetry , which can influence the dune shape and will be addressed separately in later sections .",
    "future studies should focus on the asymmetric dune resulting from simulations using different angles between ridge orientation and wind direction , as well as different shapes of the ridge .",
    "indeed , the results of our calculations should be valid for ridges which have a smooth cross section , where the slope of the surface does not exceed the critical angle for causing flow separation ( about @xmath147 ) @xcite .",
    "if the ridge s cross section has a sharp edge , then flow separation occurs and the flow is diverted parallel to the ridge along the lee side @xcite . in this case , sand can be transported in the direction parallel to the ridge wherever the wind speed within the separation zone exceeds the transport threshold . moreover ,",
    "the size of the zone of recirculating flow increases with the crest - to - brink distance of transverse rigdes @xcite , and thus the effect of secondary flow on the lateral transport of sand at the lee of the ridge should also depend on the shape of the ridge at its windward side .",
    "however , due to the assumption of our model that net flow ceases within the separation zone , the sand deposited at the lee of a ridge with sharp edge can not be transported at all .",
    "thus , three - dimensional flow patterns at the lee of dunes or obstacles should be accounted for in the modeling of dune asymmetry when the topographic rise has a sharp slope @xcite .",
    "the role of asymmetric sediment supply for barchan asymmetry has remained uncertain in the few investigations undertaken @xcite .",
    "it is admittedly a difficult task to conduct systematic field studies on the barchan shape as a function of the degree of spatial asymmetry in the upwind sediment budget .",
    "the sand flux onto the windward side of a barchan is largely dependent upon the spatial distribution of the upwind dunes or other sand sources , e.g. at a sand sea margin @xcite .",
    "spatial inhomogeneities in the local physical properties of the interdune terrain may also play an important role for the incoming flux @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the shape of a barchan migrating in a field is inevitably affected by wind trend variations in time @xcite , as well as by the interaction with neighbouring dunes through merging , breeding and lateral linking .    with the help of simulations , the barchan shape resulting from asymmetric upwind flux alone",
    "can be studied without regard to other physical factors .",
    "we consider a symmetric barchan initially migrating within an area where the influx @xmath148 is approximately a constant fraction ( @xmath149 ) of the saturated flux ( @xmath57 )  the value of @xmath150 is , in fact , within average values measured at interdune areas in typical barchan dune fields @xcite .",

    "figure [ fig : asymmetric_influx]a shows different snapshots of the evolution of the barchan dune subject to the asymmetric influx . because more sand deposits in the areas of larger influx ( @xmath156 ) , the dune adapts to the asymmetric influx by increasing its relative volume within the areas under influx @xmath156 .",
    "different ( transient ) asymmetric dune shapes appear as the dune reforms its shape in order to accomodate the larger influx @xmath156 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : asymmetric_influx]a .",

    "these conditions are the same as the ones for oblique alignment of bedforms in dense sand beds @xcite , the asymmetric barchan being the corresponding morphology under low amount of available sand . *",
    "_ topography _  a barchan crossing a topographic rise can become asymmetric ; the limb closest to the topographic rise elongates downwind .",
    "the migration velocity of a barchan that is on a tilted surface has a downhill component proportional to the tilting slope ; the preferential limb extension is downhill rather than downwind . *",
    "_ influx asymmetry _  the side of the barchan subjected to the larger influx increases in volume , whereas the opposite limb elongates downwind .",
    "the typical asymmetric morphology is a barchan with an elongated arm ( the one subjected to lower influx ) .",
    "the asymmetry is of transient nature , since the dune migrates laterally towards the region of higher influx . *",
    "_ dune collisions _  asymmetry can be triggered due to barchan collisions with lateral offset .",
    "binary collisions with large offset can lead to extension of the limb resulting from the merging of the two limbs participating at the collision .",
    "collisions between multiple barchans in a field can trigger more complex asymmetric patterns .",
    "some patterns produced in these simulations involve the elongation of one limb of the upwind dune , as reported from previous observations @xcite .    in order to improve the quantitative assessment of asymmetric barchans ,",
    "the model should be extended in order to account for secondary flow effects at the dune lee @xcite , which may be relevant for the dynamics of limb elongation due to bimodal wind regimes or due to topographic ridges with sharp slopes @xcite .",
    "indeed , the separation bubble model of section [ sec : wind_field ] does not account for the occurrence of three - dimensional flow structures within the zone of recirculating flow , which affect the dune shape at the lee and can contribute to the elongation of the limb .",
    "realistic simulations of bimodal wind regimes should further account for multiple secondary wind trends in consistence with the complex sand roses of real dune fields @xcite .",
    "moreover , real winds can be very gusty , with changes in direction of 45 degrees or more taking place in most cases in less than 15 minutes , while in some instances the changes may be gradual or abrupt @xcite .",
    "this effect of changes in wind directions should be considered in the future .",
    "finally , we also note that there are examples of seif dunes formation from vegetated linear dunes that lost their vegetation due to human impact @xcite .",
    "the formation of seif dunes in the presence of a dynamic vegetation cover remains to be investigated in the future .",
    "the results of our calculations are potentially useful for inferring local wind regimes or spatial variations either in topography or in availability of mobile sediments in planetary dune fields where asymmetric barchans occur .",
