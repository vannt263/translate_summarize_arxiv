    "many years ago mueller and navelet predicted strong decorrelation in relative azimuthal angle @xcite of jets with large rapidity separation due to exchange of the bfkl ladder between quarks ( see left panel of fig.[fig : diagrams ] ) . since then both leading - logarithmic and higher - order bfkl effects were calculated and discussed .",
    "the effect of the nll correction is large and leads to significant lowering of the cross section .",
    "the lhc opens a new possibility to study the decorrelation in azimuthal angle .",
    "first experimental data measured at @xmath1 = 7 tev are expected soon @xcite .",
    "also double parton scattering ( dps ) can be important in this context ( for diagrammatic representation of dps see right panel of fig.[fig : diagrams ] ) .",
    "we discussed recently how important is the contribution of dps in the case of the jets widely separated in rapidity @xcite and for four - jet sample @xcite .",
    "four - jet production was already discussed in the context of double parton scattering .",
    "actually it was a first process where the dps was claimed to be observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "however , in most of the past as well as current analyses the dps contribution to four - jet production is relatively small and single parton scattering ( sps ) driven by the 2 @xmath2 4 partonic processes dominates . on the theoretical side",
    "the dps effects in four - jet production were discussed in refs .",
    "a first theoretical estimate of sps four - jet production , including only some partonic subprocesses , and its comparison to dps contribution was presented in ref .",

    "some new kinematical variables useful for identification of dps were proposed in ref .",
    "presence of perturbative parton splitting mechanism was discussed in ref .",

    "we have shown how big can be the contribution of dps for jets widely separated in rapidity @xcite .",
    "understanding of this contribution is important in the context of searching for bfkl effects or in general qcd higher - order effects @xcite .    in the present letter",
    "we wish to discuss also exclusive four - jet sample where the situation in the context of searching for dps is even better @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "we showed how to maximize the dps contribution by selecting relevant kinematical cuts . here",
    "we shall show only some examples .",
    "-0.3 cm    partonic cross sections used to calculate dps are calculated only in leading order .",
    "then the cross section for dijet production can be written as : @xmath3 in our calculations we include all leading - order @xmath4 partonic subprocesses .",
    "the @xmath5-factor for dijet production is rather small , of the order of @xmath6 .",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite that already the leading - order approach gives results in sufficiently reasonable agreement with recent atlas and cms inclusive jet data .",
    "this simplified leading - order approach can be however used easily in calculating dps differential cross sections .",
    "the multi - dimensional differential cross section can be written as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and partons @xmath9 .",
    "the combinatorial factors include identity of the two subprocesses .",

    "[ fig : cms - data-1 ] we compare the results of calculation with the leading - order code alpgen @xcite with recent cms experimental data @xcite . in this analysis",
    "the cms collaboration imposed different transverse momentum cuts on the leading , subleading , 3@xmath14 and 4@xmath15 jets . in this calculation",
    "we have used an extra @xmath5-factor to effectively include higher - order effects @xcite .",
    "we get relatively good description of both transverse moentum and pseudorapidity distributions of each of the four ( ordered in transverse momentum ) jets .",
    "therefore we conclude that the calculation with the alpgen generator can be a reliable sps reference point for an exploration of the dps effects .            having shown that our approach is consistent with existing lhc four - jet data",
    "we wish to discuss how to find optimal conditions for `` observing '' the dps effects .",
    "as shown in our previous paper @xcite on dijets widely separated in rapidity the distribution in rapidity separation of such jets seems a very good observable for observing the dps . in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltay - dps-1 ] we show some examples of such distributions for different cuts on the jet transverse momenta for two collision energies @xmath1 = 7 tev and @xmath1 = 14 tev obtained with the condition of the four - jet observation .",
    "we focus only on the distance between the most remote jets and do not check what happens in between . the higher collision energy or the smaller the lower transverse momentum cut the bigger the relative dps contribution . here",
    "the relative dps contribution is much bigger than for jets widely separated in rapidity ( compare with fig .",

    "we have discussed how the double - parton scattering effects may contribute to large - rapidity - distance dijet correlations . as an example we have shown distributions in rapidity distance between the most - distant jets in rapidity .",
    "the relative contribution of the dps mechanism increases with increasing distance in rapidity between jets .",
    "we have also shown some predictions of the mueller - navelet jets in the ll and nll bfkl framework .",
    "for the cms configuration our dps contribution is smaller than the dijet sps contribution , but only slightly smaller than that for the nll bfkl calculation .",
    "we have shown that the relative effect of dps can be increased by lowering the jet transverse momenta .    in this presentation",
    "we have also discussed how to enhance the relative contribution of double - parton scattering for four - jet production .",
    "first we have confronted results of our calculations with those obtained at the lhc by the cms collaborations .",
    "the comparison indicates some evidence of dps at large pseudorapidities of the leading jet .",
    "we have shown that imposing a lower cut on transverse momenta and rapidity distance between the most remote jets improves the situation considerably enhancing the relative contribution of dps .",
    "a dedicated analysis of the dps effect is possible already with the existing data sample at @xmath1 = 7 tev .",
    "the situation at larger energies , relevant for lhc run 2 should be even better . as a consequence we predict that azimuthal correlation between jets widely separated in rapidity should dissapear in the considered kinematical domain @xcite .",
    "we have found that in some corners of the phase space the dps contribution can go even above 80 % @xcite .    in this presentation",
    "we have presented the detailed predictions .",
    "once such cross sections are measured , one could try to extract the @xmath10 parameter from the four - jet sample and try to obtain its dependence on kinematical variables .",
    "such dependence can be expected due to several reasons such as parton - parton correlations , hot spots , perturbative parton splitting .",
