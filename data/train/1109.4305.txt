    "competition between two groups or among a larger number of groups is ubiquitous in business and politics : the decades - long battle between the mac and the pc in the computer industry , between procter & gamble and unilever in the personal products industry , among all major international and local banks in the financial market , and among politicians and interest groups in the world of governance .",
    "all competitors want to increase the number of their supporters and thus increase their chances of success . in gathering supporters , competitors put much effort into persuading skeptics and those opponents who may actually be potential supporters .",
    "this kind of activity is normally modeled as a dynamic process on a complex network in which the nodes are the agents and the links are the interactions between agents .",
    "the goal of these models is to understand how an initially disordered configuration can become an ordered configuration through the interaction between agents . in the context of social science , order means agreement and disorder means disagreement @xcite . most of these models ",
    ", the sznajd model @xcite , the voter model @xcite , the majority rule model @xcite , and the social impact model @xcite  are based on two - state spin systems which tend to reduce the variability of the initial state and lead to a consensus state in which all the agents share the same opinion .",
    "however this consensus state is not very realistic , since in many real competitions there are always at least two groups that co - exist at the same time .",
    "recently a non - consensus opinion ( nco ) model @xcite was developed , where two opinions @xmath1 and @xmath2 compete and reach a non - consensus stable state . at each time",
    "step each node adopts the opinion of the majority in its `` neighborhood , '' which consists of its nearest neighbors and itself .",
    "when there is a tie , the node does not change its state .",
    "considering also the node s own opinion leads to the non - consensus state .",
    "the dynamics are such that a steady state in which opinions @xmath1 and @xmath2 coexist is quickly reached .",
    "it was conjectured , and supported by intensive simulations @xcite , that the nco model in complex networks belongs to the same universality class as percolation @xcite .    here",
    "we test how competition strategies are affected when `` contrarians '' are introduced .",
    "contrarians are agents who hold a strong opinion that is opposition to an opinion held by the rest of the group , and are not influenced by their opinion but can influence them .",
    "we develop a spin - type contrarian opinion ( co ) model in which contrarian agents are introduced into the steady state of the nco model .",
    "the goal of the contrarians is to change the opinions of the current supporters of the rival group @xcite .",
    "we see this strategy in operation , for example , when companies send free new products to potential customers in order to convince them to adopt the product and encourage their friends to do the same .",
    "we can observe it also in political campaigns when candidates `` bribe '' voters by offering favors .",
    "the questions we ask in our model are as follows .",
    "do these free products and bribes work and how ? who are the best individuals to chose as contrarians in order to make most impact on opinion change .    in this paper",
    "we introduce , into group @xmath1 , a fraction @xmath0 of contrarians , which are defined to be agents that hold a strong @xmath2 opinion , who will influence those who hold the @xmath1 opinion to change their opinion to @xmath2 .",
    "we study two different strategies of introducing contrarians , ( i ) random choosing of contrarians , and ( ii ) targeted .",
    "we study these strategies on two types of networks , erds - rnyi ( er ) @xcite and scale free ( sf ) @xcite .",
    "we find , for both strategies , that the relative size of the largest cluster in state @xmath1 undergoes a second order phase transition at a critical fraction of contrarians @xmath3 .",
    "moreover we find that , for both networks analyzed here , the targeted strategy is much more efficient than the random strategy .",
    "our results indicate that the observed second order phase transition can be mapped into mean field percolation .",
    "in the nco model@xcite , initially , a fraction @xmath4 of agents with @xmath1 opinions and @xmath5 with @xmath2 opinions are selected at random . at each time step , each network node adopts the majority opinion based on the opinions of its neighbors and itself .",
    "all updates are performed simultaneously at each time step until a steady state is reached in which both opinions coexist , which occurs for @xmath4 above a critical threshold @xmath6 .    in our co model ,",
    "the initial state is the final state of the nco model . above @xmath7",
    "we have stable clusters of both @xmath1 or @xmath2 opinions in a network of @xmath8 agents .",
    "we choose , initially , a fraction @xmath0 of @xmath1 opinion agents that are changed into @xmath2 opinion agents and so become contrarians . by contrarian we mean",
    "that , they will never change their opinion but they can influence others .",
    "then we use again the nco dynamics to reach a new steady state . in the new steady state",
    "the agents form again clusters of two opposite opinions above a certain threshold @xmath7 that now depends on @xmath0 . because of the contrarians of type @xmath2 , the @xmath1 clusters become smaller and the @xmath2 clusters increase . in fig .",
    "[ fig : f.12 ] we show a schematic plot of the dynamics of the co model .",
    "we use both random and targeted strategies to choose a fraction @xmath0 of @xmath1 agents that flip into state @xmath2 , and we analyze the results on er and sf networks . in strategy",
    "i we randomly choose a fraction @xmath0 of a agents , and in strategy ii we choose the top @xmath0 percent of the highest degree @xmath1 agents , to become contrarians .",
    "notice that the contrarians act as a quenched disorder in the network @xcite .",
    "we perform simulations of the co model in complex networks , on both er and sf networks . er networks are characterized by a poisson degree distribution with @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the degree of a node and @xmath11 is the average degree . in sf networks the degree distribution is given by @xmath12 , for @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the smallest degree , @xmath15 is the degree cutoff and @xmath16 is the exponent characterizing the broadness of the distribution . in all our simulations we use the natural cutoff , which is controlled by @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "we performed all the simulations for @xmath18 network realizations .",
    "we denote by @xmath19 the size of the largest @xmath1 cluster in the steady state .",
    "we study the effect of the contrarians . in fig .",
    "[ fig : f.2 ] we plot @xmath20 as a function of @xmath4 for different values of @xmath0 for er networks under both random and targeted strategies .",
    "the plot shows that there exists a critical value @xmath21 that depends on @xmath0 , below which @xmath22 approaches zero . as @xmath0 increases ,",
    "the largest cluster becomes significantly smaller as well as less robust , as can been seen from the shift of @xmath7 to the larger value . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : f.2 ] , we plot the size of the second largest @xmath1 cluster , @xmath23 , as a function of @xmath4 for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath23 shows a sharp peak characteristic of a second order phase transition , where @xmath22 is the order parameter and @xmath4 is the control parameter . above a certain value of @xmath24",
    ", the phase transition does not occur because , above @xmath25 , the average connectivity of the @xmath1 nodes decreases dramatically , the networks break into small clusters and no giant component of opinion @xmath1 appears . in fig .",
    "[ fig : f.con ] we show , for both strategies , the average degree @xmath11 of the @xmath1 opinion agents as a function of @xmath4 for different values of @xmath0 . as shown in @xcite for @xmath26",
    ", @xmath27 has a significant increase above @xmath28 where the nodes with opinion @xmath1 are majority .",
    "this is because when these nodes are in the minority group , they have a small average connectivity since the minority group does nt include high degree nodes .",
    "this process is analogous to targeted removing of the high degree nodes . only when they become majority nodes , close to @xmath29 , the original connectivity of the full network",
    "is recovered . however , as @xmath0 increases , we never reach the original average degree of the full network because increasing @xmath0 is equivalent to increasing the quenched disorder .",
    "it is known that for er networks the transition is lost when @xmath30 @xcite . as we can see from the plots , for @xmath31 ( strategy i ) and @xmath32 ( strategy ii )",
    ", @xmath27 drops below @xmath33 , and then the giant component can not be sustained .",
    "the loss of robustness is significantly more pronounced in the targeted strategy compared to the random strategy , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : f.2](c ) , where we plot @xmath7 as a function of @xmath0 for both strategies . from this plot",
    "we can see that the targeted strategy is significantly more efficient to annihilate the opinion @xmath1 clusters than the random strategy .",
    "for example , for @xmath34 , the network is 25% less robust in the targeted strategy compared to the random one .",
    "the reason is that the initial state of our model is the final state of the nco model , which above its threshold has clusters of nodes @xmath1 of all sizes .",
    "thus under the random strategy we select nodes at random that are mainly in small @xmath1 clusters . under the targeted strategy",
    "the selection of contrarians from the nodes of highest degree places them mainly in the largest initial @xmath1 cluster where they can influence more than if they were isolated in smaller clusters , as in the random strategy .",
    "the high degree nodes shorten the distances between all the pairs of nodes in a cluster , which allows them to interact more easily .",
    "also , because they have many neighbors , they can influence the opinions of other @xmath1 nodes more efficiently .    in order to verify the above arguments , we compute , for our initial condition ( @xmath26 ) before adding the contrarians , the degree distribution of nodes @xmath1 inside and outside the largest cluster . in fig .",
    "[ fig : f.fer](a ) we plot the degree distributions @xmath35 of @xmath1 nodes inside and outside the largest cluster for three different values of @xmath4 above the threshold of the nco model .",
    "notice that the nodes outside the largest cluster have a degree distribution with a high probability of low connectivity .",
    "the probability of low connectivity increases as @xmath4 increases , and thus under a targeted strategy the nodes in those small clusters are almost never designated as contrarians .",
    "thus nodes in the largest component are more likely to be selected under a targeted strategy than under a random one .    in order to further test our assumption",
    ", we compute the fraction @xmath36 , defined as the ratio of the number of nodes with degree @xmath10 in the largest @xmath1 cluster and the total number of nodes in all the @xmath1 clusters with the same degree .",
    "when @xmath37 , all the nodes with degree @xmath10 are in the largest @xmath1 cluster . in fig .",
    "[ fig : f.fer](b ) , we plot @xmath36 as a function of @xmath10 for different values of @xmath4 .",
    "as @xmath10 increases , we see that @xmath37 is faster for increasing @xmath4 because the larger @xmath4 is , the larger @xmath19 will be .",
    "thus the highest degree nodes belong to the largest cluster and the lower degree nodes are less likely to be in the largest cluster .",
    "this explains why a targeted strategy is significantly more efficient than a random one .    because @xmath0 is our main parameter",
    ", we next investigate the behavior of the system as a function of @xmath0 for different values of @xmath4 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : f.4 ] we plot @xmath22 as a function of @xmath0 for fixed @xmath4 for er networks under both strategies . from the plot we can see that @xmath19 is more robust as @xmath4 is larger , and the behavior of the curve is again characteristic of a second order phase transition",
    ". however this curve seems to be smoother than the transition found above ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : f.2 ] ) with @xmath4 as the control parameter .    in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : f.4 ] ( a ) we plot the first derivative of @xmath22 with respect to @xmath0 for two different system sizes for @xmath38 .",
    "we can see a jump that becomes sharper as the system size increases .",
    "we find the same behavior for other values of @xmath4 above the threshold . in figs .",
    "[ fig : f.6 ] ( a ) and [ fig : f.6 ] ( b ) we show @xmath23 and the first derivative of @xmath22 with respect to @xmath0 for @xmath39 and for different values of @xmath4 .",
    "we find that the peak of @xmath23 and the jump of the derivative of @xmath22 occurs at the same value of @xmath0 .",
    "this behavior is characteristic of a second order phase transition , where the peak of @xmath23 indicates the position of the threshold @xmath3 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : f.6](c ) we plot the critical threshold @xmath3 as a function of @xmath4 for both strategies . comparing the two strategies for the same value of @xmath4 , strategy ii always has the smaller @xmath3 .",
    "this demonstrates again that strategy ii is better because a very small fraction of @xmath0 is enough to destroy the @xmath1 opinion clusters .",
    "next , we present results indicating that the co model is in the same universality class as regular percolation .",
    "percolation in random networks ( _ e.g _ , er)@xcite predicts that at criticality the cluster size distribution of finite clusters @xmath40 with @xmath41 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : f.8 ] we plot @xmath42 for both random and targeted strategies as a function of @xmath43 for finite @xmath1 clusters at criticality . as we can see for both strategies , @xmath44 .",
    "moreover , from @xmath23 we calculate the exponent @xmath45 , which represents how the mean finite size diverges with distance to criticality ( not shown here ) , from which we obtain @xmath46 , as in mean field percolation .",
    "the values of the two exponents we obtain strongly indicate that our co model in er networks is in the same universality class as mean field percolation in complex networks below @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "many real social networks are not er , but instead possess a sf degree distribution .",
    "it is well known that dynamic processes in sf networks propagate significantly more efficiently @xcite than in er networks . for sf networks",
    "we find that the system also undergoes a second order phase transition as in er networks with mean field exponents ( not shown here ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : f.3 ] ( a ) we plot @xmath7 as a function of @xmath0 for sf networks with @xmath47 . for a certain value of @xmath0 ,",
    "when @xmath48 , we lose the largest @xmath1 cluster .",
    "thus the larger the value of @xmath7 , the less robust the networks . from the plot",
    ", we find that for all values of @xmath0 , strategy ii has much larger @xmath7 than strategy i. this shows that sf networks are significantly less robust under strategy ii than under strategy i , which shows that for sf networks , strategy ii is significantly more efficient compared to strategy i. to further test our conclusion , in fig .",
    "[ fig : f.3 ] ( b ) , we plot @xmath3 as a function of @xmath4 for the same sf networks . as @xmath3 is the minimum concentration of contrarians needed to destroy the largest @xmath1 cluster , thus for the same initial condition , the networks are less robust with smaller @xmath3 than larger one . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f.3](b ) , for the same value of @xmath4 , @xmath3 under strategy ii is always significantly smaller than under strategy i. this result again support our former conclusion that for sf networks , strategy ii is more efficient than strategy i. as mentioned above , this is because the targeted strategy sends most of the contrarians into the largest @xmath1 cluster . in order to test that , in fig .  [",
    "fig : f.10 ] we plot @xmath36 as a function of @xmath10 for sf networks . as we can see from fig",
    ".  [ fig : f.10 ] , almost all of the high degree nodes ( @xmath49 ) belong to the largest @xmath1 cluster .",
    "this behavior is more pronounced as @xmath4 increases because @xmath19 increases with @xmath4 .      if we compare all our results between er and sf networks , we find that both strategies are more efficient for sf networks .",
    "for example , when we compare fig .",
    "[ fig : f.10 ] ( a ) with fig .",
    "[ fig : f.2 ] ( c ) we see that for all the values of @xmath0 , @xmath7 is larger for sf networks than for er networks for both strategies .",
    "the main difference between er and sf networks is that sf networks possess larger hubs than er networks , and thus it is more efficient to destroy the largest @xmath1 cluster .",
    "we also find that the targeted strategy is more efficient in sf than in er networks due to the presence of these large hubs .",
    "for example , when @xmath50 , the sf network is 64% less robust under the targeted strategy than under the random strategy . in er networks , for the same value of @xmath0 , the robustness of the networks decreases only by 17% .",
    "if we compare fig .",
    "[ fig : f.fer ] ( b ) with fig .",
    "[ fig : f.10 ] we see that higher degree nodes are more likely to belong to the largest cluster in sf networks than in er networks , since @xmath51 faster in sf networks compared to er networks .",
    "when two groups compete , either group can use both random and targeted strategies to influence the other group .",
    "will the impact of these strategies differ if the group using them is in the majority , as opposed to being in the minority ? because the largest majority cluster will have a larger average degree than the largest minority cluster , we assume it will be harder to change the opinion of the majority than the minority for @xmath52 . in order to quantitatively understand the effect of contrarians in both a minority group and a majority group , we compute the relative change of the size of the largest minority and majority clusters , @xmath53 , given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the size of the largest @xmath1 cluster in our final steady state and @xmath56 is the cluster before adding the contrarians .",
    "notice that @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) means that the @xmath1 agents are minority ( majority ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : f.delt ] we plot @xmath53 as a function of @xmath0 for @xmath59 ( minority ) and @xmath60 ( majority ) under both strategies for both er and sf networks . from the plots we can see that below @xmath3 ( marked by arrows in the plots ) , @xmath53 is larger for minority than for majority for the same value of @xmath0 , under both strategies i and ii , and for the two networks used here , er and sf .",
    "thus , as argued above , the minority groups are easier to convince than the majority groups .",
    "moreover , this phenomenon is more pronounced under the targeted strategy than under the random . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : f.delt ] we plot @xmath61 , which is the ratio between @xmath62 of minority and @xmath53 of majority , as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "as we can see for the er network , the contrarians under a targeted strategy are twice more effective when they are in the minority group than when they are in the majority group , while under a random strategy they are approximately 1.5 times more effective .",
    "we can see a similar but more significant tendency in sf networks .",
    "this agrees with empirical fact , where majority groups always have more power than minority groups , and thus it is easier for a majority group to change the opinion of a minority group .",
    "we conclude that our model seems to mimic well the two - group competition in the real world , and that it also reveals some underlying complex phenomena associated with the process .",
    "in introducing contrarians into a system , we have used two strategies : ( i ) random and ( ii ) targeted .",
    "our contrarians hold a strong @xmath2 opinion and the system has two stable opinion @xmath1 clusters and opinion @xmath2 clusters .",
    "we find that , for both strategies , the size of the largest @xmath1 opinion cluster shrinks , as in a phase transition phenomena . as the concentration of contrarians increases , the largest @xmath1 cluster becomes smaller and smaller until it reaches zero at a critical concentration @xmath3 . above @xmath3 ,",
    "the largest @xmath1 cluster disappears .",
    "our results show that the system undergoes a second order phase transition for both control parameters @xmath4 and @xmath0 , behavior that resembles mean field percolation .",
    "we also find that , for both er and sf networks , the targeted strategy is more efficient than the random strategy , because the targeted strategy always sends more contrarians into the largest cluster than the random .",
    "both strategies effect more the minority group and much less the majority group .",
    "note that since sf networks have hubs , both strategies work better in sf networks than in er networks . based on our results ,",
    "we can answer the questions we raise in the introduction .",
    "free products and favors ( `` bribes '' ) do effectively attract more supporters , but the most effective strategy is to target those potential supporters with the most connections and offer the free products and favors to them .",
    "we thank jia shao for discussions , and unmdp , foncyt - pict 2008/0293 , onr , dtra , dfg , eu project epiwork , and the israel science foundation for financial support .                                          in simulations of nco model on 2d lattices , shao et al@xcite suggested that it is in the same universality class as invasion percolation .",
