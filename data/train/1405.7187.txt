    "the property of fermions interacting with a bose fluid has been a long - standing subject of research in condensed matter physics , dating back to the study of @xmath0he-@xmath1he mixtures  @xcite . with the recent development of research activity in ultracold gases , it is now possible to experimentally create mixtures of degenerate bosonic and fermionic atomic gases  @xcite .",
    "very recently , the first experimental realization of a superfluid bose - fermi mixture was reported  @xcite , the fermi gas being at the unitarity limit .",
    "there are several theoretical works on mixtures of superfluid bose gases interating with spin-1/2 fermi gases  @xcite , but the behavior of coexisting superfluid fermi and bose gases in the case of strong fermi - fermi interaction has not yet been considered in the literature . furthermore , since spin - imbalanced fermions are predicted to give rise to exotic phases such as the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) phase  @xcite , it is of great interest to investigate how their behavior is modified by the interaction with bosons .    in this paper , we show that in a homogeneous configuration the chandrasekhar - clogston critical polarization for the breakdown of superfluidity is larger than in the absence of the bosonic component  @xcite .",
    "we then consider the case of a harmonically trapped configuration : when the bose - bose and bose - fermi interactions are equal , the fermionic density in the region of coexistence with bosons becomes flat , because the interaction with bosons exactly compensates the external trapping potential  @xcite .",
    "we investigate the phase diagram of the trapped gas when the fermion imbalance is varied , and show that , for a finite range of polarization , the fermionic density in the bose - fermi coexistence region can become inhomogeneous .",
    "the balanced unitary fermi gas is known to be fully superfluid at zero temperature . as one increases the polarization ,",
    "it has been observed that the system phase separates into a balanced superfluid phase and an imbalanced normal phase  @xcite .",
    "the two phases have different densities , and the equilibrium conditions between the two phases fix the ratio @xmath2 between the density of the minority species over the density of the majority species in the normal phase , which determine the chandrasekhar - clogston limit . at zero temperature , this critical ratio turns out to be , at unitarity , @xmath3  @xcite . as we show , this value is modified by the interaction with bosons .",
    "we assume that the fermi gas is phase separated into a superfluid phase with density @xmath4 for both species and a normal phase with density @xmath5 and @xmath6 for the spin - up ( majority ) and spin - down ( minority ) fermions , respectively .",
    "the density of the coexisting bosons in the fermi superfluid phase is @xmath7 and that in the normal phase is @xmath8 .",
    "later we discuss the stability conditions for such configurations .",
    "we assume that both the bosonic and fermionic species can be described within the local density approximation and both the bose - bose and the bose - fermi interactions are weak enough to be treated within the mean field approximation .",
    "then the energy density in the superfluid phase ( @xmath9 ) and in the normal phase ( @xmath10 ) takes the form @xmath11 , \\notag \\\\",

    "the equilibrium between the two phases is determined by matching the pressure and the chemical potentials for both bosons and fermions at the interface , which leads to the following conditions for @xmath2 and @xmath28 : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is a dimensionless parameter independent of the bosonic density . as a consequence",
    "also the critical ratios @xmath2 and @xmath32 are independent of the boson density , provided there are background bosons with nonzero densities in both phases .",
    "the parameter @xmath33 has an important physical meaning , corresponding to the ratio between the change in the energy of fermions caused by the induced interaction @xmath34 in the static limit and the non - interacting fermi energy .",

    "as @xmath33 becomes larger , the value of @xmath2 decreases reaching the minimum value of @xmath39 , which means that the superfluid phase of fermions is stabilized by the interaction with bosons .",
    "the ratio @xmath32 , on the other hand , increases with @xmath33 reaching the maximum value of @xmath40 , which implies that the density jump at the interface of the two phases becomes larger ; the maximum value of the jump , corresponding to @xmath41 , is @xmath42 to be compared with the value @xmath43 when @xmath44 .",

    "the dynamical stability of the superfluid phase requires that the following inequality be obeyed  @xcite : @xmath47}{\\delta n_s^2 } - 4 \\frac{g_{bf}^2}{g_{bb } } > 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is equivalent to imposing @xmath48 .",
    "we have checked that the condition for having real solutions for @xmath2 and @xmath32 coincides with the one ensuring dynamical stability .",
    "if @xmath33 becomes larger than @xmath49 , the superfluid fermi gas and the bose gas are expected to phase separate .",
    "let us now consider the case of a trapped quantum mixture . in the absence of bosons , it is known that as one introduces a small imbalance between the two species , the central part of the trap remains superfluid , and the outer shell is turned into a normal state  @xcite . when the imbalance is large enough , the whole fermi gas is in the normal state .    in the presence of bosons ,",

    "the second equation explicitly reveals that , if @xmath64 , the fermion densities are not affected by the presence of the trap , and take a constant value inside the core  @xcite .",
    "this follows from the fact that the effect of the trap on the fermions is exactly canceled by the mean - field interaction with bosons  . conversely the bosonic density is not affected by the presence of fermions and , choosing an external potential of harmonic form , the bosonic density , for @xmath61",
    ", takes an inverted parabola profile , whose shape is solely determined by the total number of bosons and the bose - bose coupling constant @xmath65 .",
    "if instead @xmath66 , the fermions feel an anti - trapping potential in the core region and their density will increases when one moves away from the center .    when the imbalance is small , most of the fermions are in the superfluid phase , and one can write down a similar energy functional as ( [ enormal ] ) , but the region @xmath61 is filled with the superfluid phase , while the region @xmath67 is divided into an inner superfluid phase and an outer normal phase .",

    "the equilibrium between the superfluid phase and the normal phase in the tail is determined by matching the pressure and the chemical potentials at the interface , and the critical ratio @xmath70 is equal to 0.40 , which is the value predicted in the absence of bosons  @xcite .    for concreteness we provide predictions for the mixture of @xmath71li bosons and @xmath72li fermions reported in  @xcite where @xmath73 , and we focus on the special case @xmath74 .",
    "this condition @xmath75 ( corresponding to @xmath76 ) , together with that of unitarity for the fermi component , are achievable for a magnetic field of @xmath77 g , leading to a fermion - fermion scattering length of @xmath78 , and to a boson - boson scattering length @xmath79 , the average fermi momentum being @xmath80 m@xmath81 .    the density profile of the fermions ( both inside and outside the core ) can be obtained by solving ( [ eqcore ] ) or ( [ eqcoresf ] ) and similar equations for the region @xmath67 . in fig .",
    "[ verge ] , we plot two density distributions for fixed values of @xmath82 and @xmath83 but with two different values of @xmath84 .",

    "a larger value of @xmath90 would correspond to the onset of a normal region in the core ( see also fig .",
    "[ polarization ] ) .",
    "for intermediate values of the population imbalance , coexistence of the superfluid and the normal phase takes place in the core region , giving rise to inhomogeneity and new interesting physics .",
    "inhomogeneity in the core can be reached either by starting with a balanced superfluid gas and gradually decrease the number of minority fermions till the normal part enters the core , or by starting with a completely polarized gas and gradually increase the number of minority fermions till a superfluid phase region in the core is favorable . in fig .",
    "[ polarization ] , the two critical polarizations for entering the inhomogeneous core phase are plotted as a function of @xmath92 , where @xmath93 , for two different values of @xmath94 .",
    "the upper region corresponds to the phase with the whole system being normal ( fig .",

    "the two critical polarization lines approach the value @xmath95 as @xmath96 .",
    "this asymptotic value corresponds to the critical polarization for the onset of superfluidity in the absence of bosons  @xcite .",
    "we now discuss the possible scenarios characterizing the inhomogeneous phase for intermediate values of population imbalance ( see fig .",
    "[ polarization ] ) .",
    "the simplest possibility , hereafter called the superfluid - normal ( s - n ) scenario , is that the core is phase separated into a central superfluid and an outer normal phase .",
    "the equilibrium condition between the superfluid phase and the normal phase turns out to be determined by the same conditions ( [ xyconditions ] ) holding for the homogeneous mixture .",
    "another possibility , hereafter called the normal - superfluid - normal (",
    "n - s - n ) scenario , is that the core is phase separated into a central normal phase and an outer superfluid phase , while the tail is normal .",
    "the two scenarios have very similar energies , and can be easily distinguished in experiments   by measuring the doubly - integrated column density @xmath98 , because the superfluid region appears as a flat profile in the difference @xmath99  @xcite .",
    "this flat doubly - integrated density profile is due to pairing and should not be confused with the 3d flat density profile that is caused by the fermi - bose interaction .",
    "typical density distributions and corresponding doubly integrated column densities are plotted in fig .",
    "[ bosons_fermions_snn ] . another interesting feature of this inhomogeneous core phase is that the boson density is not a simple inverse parabola , but has a small jump ( not visible in the figure ) at the phase boundary between the superfluid and normal fermion .",
    "the two scenarios of fig .",
    "[ bosons_fermions_snn ] can be energetically separated by changing the value of @xmath65 as compared to @xmath100 .",
    "if , e.g. , @xmath101 the fermions feel a small anti - trapping potential in the core , and the second scenario , fig .",
    "[ bosons_fermions_snn](b ) , will take place .",
    "the difference should be clearly visible experimentally , as shown in the doubly integrated densities in fig .",
    "[ bosons_fermions_snn ] .",
    "the emergence of the inhomogeneous phase is also compatible with other more exotic possibilities , like the emergence of the fflo phase  @xcite .",
