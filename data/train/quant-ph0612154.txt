    ", cluster states of photons can be used to perform computation  @xcite . moreover , exotic states of many photons , such as maximally path - entangled noon states , have found their place in quantum metrology  @xcite , lithography  @xcite , and sensing  @xcite .",
    "a natural question arises : how can these complicated states of light be prepared ?",
    "one approach to the problem is to make use of an optical nonlinearity .",
    "however , due to the relatively small average number of photons involved , the overall nonlinear effect is extremely weak and typically of little practical use  @xcite . an alternative way to enable",
    "an effective photon - photon interaction is to use ancilla modes and projective measurements  @xcite . in this way",
    "a quantum state generator can be realized utilizing only linear optical elements ( beam splitters and phase shifters ) and photon counters , at the expense of the process becoming probabilistic  @xcite .",
    "hybrid schemes , combining weak nonlinearities and measurements , have been also proposed recently  @xcite .    despite many theoretical efforts ,",
    "the problem of quantum state preparation of light with the help of projective measurements has not been formalized and solved in a general setting .",

    "we concentrate on formalizing and solving the problem of quantum state generation with linear optics and projective measurements .",
    "we first formuiate the physical problem of state generation in terms of polynomial equations in section ii .",
    "we then argue that the equations obtained can be solved analytically , by applying standard tools of algebraic geometry , when a unitarity constraint is relaxed .",
    "moreover , we show how unitarity can be reintroduced into the solution by addition of auxiliary vacuum modes . in section",
    "iii we illustrate the formalism by considering an example of a  noon \" state generator .",
    "we demonstrate how an optimal  noon \" state generator can be constructed using convex optimization tools . a simple example for",
    "5-photon  noon \" state generation disproves the  no - go \" conjecture  @xcite .",
    "we draw conclusions and summarize in section iv .",
    "any linear - optical quantum state generator ( loqsg ) can be thought of as consisting of two main blocks ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . the first block is a @xmath0-port linear - optical device , described by a unitary matrix @xmath1 combining @xmath0 input into @xmath0 output modes .",
    "the second block represents a projective measurement of some of the modes of the first block , in which a certain pattern of photons measured in some @xmath2 of the modes is considered a `` successful measurement '' , leading to a preparation of the desired state in the remaining modes ( compare also refs .",
    "this measurement is probabilistic  but heralded  or `` event - ready '' .",
    "clearly , the output is determined by an interplay between the numbers of input photons , the entries of the matrix @xmath3 , and the numbers of photons detected .",
    "there are two types of problems that can be formulated around the concept of loqsg .",
    "the first problem is the following : given the matrix @xmath3 and a known input state , which output states can be generated for different projective measurements ? this is what could be referred to as the `` forward problem '' .",
    "this question is equivalent to the problem of finding the effective nonlinearity generated by a given projective measurement and was addressed in refs .",
    "the second problem is that of state preparation : given an input state , a projective measurement , and a target state , is it possible to determine a unitary matrix @xmath3 , of appropriate dimension , involving potentially further auxiliary modes , describing the unitary block of the loqsg ? given a certain input state , this important problem asks whether a device for the preparation of a certain quantum state can be identified , and if so , what elements it contains .",
    "once the unitary is found , there is a simple , well - known prescription for converting it to an optical implementation with beam - splitters and phase - shifters , etc .",
    "finding such a unitary we call the `` inverse problem '' . in this section , we provide a mathematical description of loqsg and illustrate how methods of algebraic geometry can be used to solve this inverse problem .        to be more specific , we start from a given input @xmath4 in @xmath0 optical modes obtained from photon sources .",
    "then , we investigate all state vectors that can be reached from this using arbitrary networks of linear optical elements  @xcite .",
    "we hence investigate the orbit @xmath5 of an input state vector @xmath4 .",
    "the unitary @xmath6 acting in the hilbert space of quantum states is the standard fock - bargmann representation of the unitary transformation @xmath3 acting on modes .",
    "if we now denote with @xmath7 the desired output in @xmath0-@xmath8 of the modes upon a particular projective measurement @xmath9 on @xmath8 of the modes , then @xmath10 is the set of all state vectors which can be converted into @xmath7 by the measurement of @xmath11 in auxiliary modes .",
    "the @xmath12 represents a probability of success , and each @xmath13 denotes a state vector orthogonal to @xmath11 .",
    "the solution to the state preparation problem is then the intersection of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "since there exists a one - to - one correspondence between photonic states and ( possibly infinite ) polynomials in the creation operators of the modes  @xcite , the problem of finding the intersection of @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be recast in terms of polynomial equalities .",
    "we will assume throughout the paper that the input has been prepared using individual sources , so the input states are product states of fock states with respect to @xmath0 modes : @xmath16 .",
    "these input modes are associated with @xmath0 creation operators @xmath17 .",
    "the mode transformation of the loqsg is given by a @xmath18 unitary matrix @xmath3 .",
    "in other words , the creation operators transform as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denotes the creation operators of the output modes .",
    "the output state of the loqsg before a projective measurement hence reads @xmath21 here , @xmath22 is a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath23 in the creation operators .",
    "coefficients of the monomials in @xmath24 are in turn homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath25 belonging to the polynomial ring @xmath26 $ ] .    the output of the loqsg after a successful projective measurement of @xmath27 photons in modes @xmath28 is then given by @xmath29 the state vector @xmath30 is the result of the action of a polynomial @xmath31 on the vacuum @xmath32 .",
    "the polynomial @xmath33 is constructed from @xmath24 by selecting all terms which contain @xmath34 exactly to the powers @xmath35 , respectively , and replacing these creation operators by @xmath36 afterwards .",
    "thus , the polynomial @xmath33 acting on vacuum describes the final state in the first @xmath0-@xmath8 unmeasured modes , which form the output of the device .    for further convenience",
    ", we have summarized all symbols used in our paper relevant to our description of the loqsg and their corresponding meaning in the table contained in appendix a.    by construction @xmath33 is a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath37 , @xmath38 , with coefficients in @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "similarly , the desired output of the loqsg , @xmath7 , is a state vector in the modes @xmath39-@xmath8 , and can be written as a polynomial @xmath40 acting on vacuum .",
    "the problem of finding a loqsg is then equivalent to finding a unitary matrix @xmath3 such that @xmath41 , for some nonzero @xmath42 .",
    "we notice that for the polynomial equality @xmath43 to hold true , the coefficients of like monomials in @xmath33 and @xmath44 must be equal .",
    "this leads to a system of polynomial equations in the variables @xmath45 , the entries of our transformation matrix @xmath3 .",
    "this system of polynomial equations , along with the constraint that @xmath3 be unitary , is the mathematical formulation of the state preparation problem . in general",
    ", there is no efficient solution technique for solving such a system .",
    "it is because the unitarity constraint involves the operation of complex conjugation and hence can not be written in an algebraic form , i.e. , in the same way as the polynomial equations .",
    "so , we instead propose a method for finding the mode transformation matrix for a larger loqsg described by input @xmath46 and measurement @xmath47 .",
    "the method involves two steps : ( 1 ) for the original system , we relax the constraint that the matrix @xmath3 be unitary , and solve the polynomial system @xmath43 for non - unitary matrix @xmath48 with entries @xmath49 ; ( 2 ) for @xmath48 as found in step ( 1 ) , we find a larger matrix @xmath50 which is unitary and contains @xmath48 as a submatrix ; this @xmath50 describes the loqsg , and will generate the desired state @xmath51 in the unmeasured modes .    to realize the step ( 1 ) and to solve the polynomial system @xmath43",
    ", we use the grbner basis technique  @xcite .",
    "we first find a grbner basis , @xmath52 $ ] , for the ideal generated by the coefficients of @xmath53 .",
    "this grbner basis is the minimal set of polynomials that do not leave a remainder when the original polynomials are divided by them .",
    "one of the essential features of this approach is contained in the elimination theorem , which states that the grbner basis consists of polynomials of only the first variable in the ordering , @xmath54,\\ ] ] the first two variables , @xmath55 $ ] , and so forth .",
    "this property allows us to simply find the solution to the whole system by solving for each variable subsequently  a procedure that is often regarded as extension of a solution .",
    "that means finding the solutions @xmath56 of @xmath57 , @xmath58 of @xmath59 , and so on .",
    "thus , the whole problem is reduced to finding roots of monovariate polynomials . in this way",
    ", the grbner basis technique is the generalization to polynomial systems of the technique of gaussian elimination for linear systems , and is simple to implement in algebraic software .    for the case of product - state inputs",
    ", we can simplify the polynomial system of equations by eliminating some arbitrary factors before using the grbner basis technique .",
    "we remark that for any matrix @xmath48 , which is a solution to the polynomial system , a rescaling of the rows of @xmath48  corresponding to the input modes of the product state  by arbitrary nonzero factors @xmath60 and of the columns of @xmath48  corresponding to the measured modes  by arbitrary nonzero factors @xmath61 will generate another solution to the system .",
    "hence , for any solution @xmath48 , we define the equivalence class of @xmath48 by @xmath62=\\{xay : x=\\text{diag}(x_1,\\ldots , x_n),y=\\text{diag}(y_1,\\ldots , y_n),y_1=\\ldots = y_{n - m}=1\\}$ ] . in any such equivalence class , there is exactly one member @xmath48 for which @xmath63 .",
    "hence , by setting the aforementioned variables to 1 from the very beginning , one can solve a much simpler polynomial system in the remaining variables using the grbner basis technique ; each solution of that system will correspond to an equivalence class of solutions for the entire system .",
    "we call such a solution an equivalence class representative .    for a given input and projective measurement",
    ", one will find , in general , many equivalence classes of solutions . in most cases ,",
    "an equivalence class representative @xmath48 will not be unitary and hence will not conserve the canonical commutation relations , which implies that @xmath48 and hence an underlying loqsg is not physically realizable .",
    "however , for a non - unitary @xmath48 , one can think of a larger optical system described by a unitary matrix @xmath50 , and hence experimentally implementable , in @xmath64 modes which in turn contains a member of @xmath62 $ ] as a submatrix .",
    "physically , this corresponds to an addition of auxiliary modes to the loqsg .",
    "then , if we input and measure vacuum in these additional modes , the entries of @xmath3 corresponding to the added modes do not affect the final state of the original modes .",
    "given an input on @xmath0 modes and a desired output on @xmath65 modes , the ( i ) total number of modes @xmath66 , the ( ii ) unitary @xmath67 , and the ( iii ) measurement pattern @xmath68 reflecting success are then the solution to the problem of finding a loqsg . the question arises : for a given non - unitary matrix @xmath48 , when is it possible to find a matrix @xmath50 which is unitary and contains some member of @xmath62 $ ] as a submatrix ?",
    "moreover , how can we find the extension which optimizes the success probability of the loqsg ?",
    "it is not difficult to see that any matrix @xmath48 can be extended if @xmath69 , so if the largest singular value of @xmath48 is not larger than unity ( compare also ref .",
    "hence for any @xmath48 , we can always extend @xmath70 $ ] to a unitary .",
    "let the singular value decomposition of @xmath48 be denoted as @xmath71 , where @xmath72 are unitary and @xmath73 .",
    "then , the minimum dimension of the extended unitary @xmath3 containing @xmath74 is @xmath75 , where @xmath76 .",
    "thus , @xmath77 additional vacuum modes are sufficient to extend a member of @xmath62 $ ] to a unitary .",
    "the minimum number of additional modes needed to extend at least one member of @xmath62 $ ] remains unsolved .",
    "however , we can solve the problem of optimizing the success probability of the extended loqsg using , for example , ideas from optimization theory  @xcite .",
    "for any solution of the polynomial equations the success probability of correct state preparation is by definition given by @xmath12 .",
    "the allowed rescaling of rows and columns rescale the amplitudes in the respective input and output modes such that within an equivalence class @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the success probability and @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the arbitrary row and column multipliers as presented in the definition of our equivalence classes .",
    "note , that w.l.o.g .",
    "it is sufficient to chose @xmath80 and @xmath81 real and positive , thus every quantity in ( [ eqn : ps ] ) is real .",
    "the problem is then to maximize @xmath79 subject to the constraint @xmath82 . for simplicity we will focus on the important case when @xmath83 for all @xmath84 and @xmath85 for all @xmath86 .",
    "then , for given @xmath87 , the constraint can be written as a so - called semi - definite constraint .",
    "semi - definite optimization problems can be efficiently solved and solvers are readily available @xcite . as @xmath88 is invertible , the constraint is equivalent to @xmath89\\geq 0 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the objective function , @xmath90 for a constant @xmath91 , is a monomial , and hence clearly not linear .",
    "however , this monomial can be relaxed to again a hierarchy of semi - definite constraints , without altering the optimal objective value : let @xmath92 be the smallest integer such that @xmath93 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath94 ; if @xmath0 is smaller , we can always pad with variables that we enforce to be unity by means of linear constraints",
    ". then , let @xmath95 for @xmath96 , and @xmath97 for @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "hence , we have introduced a number of new variables , according to a hierarchy .",
    "each of the quadratic equality constraints of this form can actually be enforced , as is easy to see , see footnote  @xcite .",
    "in fact , given @xmath87 , we have written the above problem as a semi - definite problem . in turn",
    ", relaxations give efficient upper bounds to the success probability for the loqsg when simultaneously varying @xmath100 and @xmath87 .",
    "the solution to this problem gives rise to the loqsg operating with the highest probability of success within the equivalence class of @xmath48 .",
    "then , for a given input and measurement , the overall optimal loqsg can be found by simply optimizing within each equivalence class by the method described above , and choosing the best equivalence class .",
    "to illustrate how to solve the problem of the intersection of @xmath14 and @xmath15 using the language of polynomials , let us consider the state generation problem for target states of the form @xmath101 the so - called path - entangled noon state  @xcite .",
    "the noon state is important in a number of applications such as quantum metrology and lithography  @xcite .",
    "it can not , however , be generated using only linear optics from product sources , and , therefore , the noon - state generation problem is both important and nontrivial . for noon - state generation ,",
    "we require @xmath102=\\frac{\\alpha}{\\sqrt{2 n ! } } ( ( a_{1,\\text{out}}^{\\dag})^n+(a_{2,\\text{out}}^{\\dag})^n).\\ ] ] eq .",
    "( [ reducible ] ) can not be satisfied for input states for which @xmath103 for any @xmath104 . to see this , note that the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ reducible ] ) has a unique factorization into distinct linear terms .",
    "if @xmath105 for any mode @xmath106 the lhs would necessarily have multiple identical linear factors of in @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "hence , for the equality to hold , we must have @xmath109 .",
    "thus , using polynomial properties , we have shown that the intersection of @xmath14 and @xmath15 is empty for any @xmath110 which contains more than @xmath111 photons in any of its modes .",
    "in other words , we have demonstrated that the largest noon state that might be generated from @xmath0 modes with a total of @xmath112 measured photons is @xmath113 .",
    "the argument above is only useful for determining whether an intersection is empty .",
    "however , the ultimate goal of this section is to present a constructive method to find all points in the intersection when it is non - empty . to illustrate our method",
    ", we demonstrate how to build a noon - state loqsg .",
    "let us consider the following loqsg input @xmath114 . in this case",
    "the mode transformation matrix @xmath48 is a @xmath115 matrix with @xmath116 complex entries @xmath49 .",
    "we are particularly interested in a projective measurement of one photon in mode @xmath117 , i.e. , @xmath118 .",
    "the total number of photons in the remaining ( unmeasured ) modes is thus @xmath119 and , therefore , the only noon state that can be created is the one corresponding to the state vector @xmath120 .",
    "proceeding as discussed in section ii we calculate the polynomials @xmath24 , @xmath121 , and @xmath33 .",
    "they read , @xmath122 , \\\\",
    "q & = & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\cdot5 ! } }      \\left((a^{\\dagger}_{1,\\text{out}})^5 +       ( a^{\\dagger}_{2,\\text{out}})^5\\right ) .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the equality @xmath43 leads to a system of six polynomial equations for the coefficients of @xmath123 , @xmath124 , with respect to ten complex variables : the nine elements of @xmath48 and @xmath42 .",
    "we now simplify the system to solve only for equivalence classes by setting @xmath125 . once the grbner basis technique is used to solve the simplified system",
    ", one finds that there are finitely many equivalence classes . here",
    ", we will illustratively show the work for one of them ( in fact , for an optimal one ) .",
    "the following matrix is the optimal equivalence class representative : @xmath126\\ ] ] although the mode transformation in eq .",
    "( [ 3x3matrix ] ) generates the final desired noon state vector up to normalization @xmath127 with @xmath128 , it is easy to see that the matrix @xmath48 is non - unitary and must be extended .",
    "we now seek to optimize the success probability , @xmath129 of the extended unitary @xmath3 over all @xmath130 , and @xmath131 such that @xmath132 is extendable .",
    "let us view @xmath130 in spherical coordinates : @xmath133 .",
    "for a given direction @xmath134 , the optimal @xmath79 is reached when @xmath135 is chosen maximally ; thus , we choose @xmath135 so that the largest singular value of @xmath132 is 1 . for a given @xmath131 ,",
    "then , the optimal success probability of the extension over all @xmath100 can be found by varying @xmath136 and @xmath137 over an entire sphere ; call this @xmath138 . then , by evaluating @xmath138 over a reasonably large range of @xmath131 , the global optimum of the extension can be found .    using the optimization procedure described above , we find that the global maximal success probability is reached at a point @xmath139 for which the matrix can be extended minimally , i.e. , by only 1 additional dimension .",
    "it remains unclear whether this result will hold true in general .",
    "one can check that the unitary matrix @xmath140\\ ] ] contains a member of @xmath62 $ ] as a submatrix and generates a unitary transformation on four modes which results in a five - photon noon state starting with input @xmath141 and projective measurement of one photon in mode @xmath117 and vacuum in mode @xmath142 with optimal success probability @xmath143 . by using the well - known algorithm presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , the above unitary matrix can easily be transformed into a linear - optical network consisting of phase - shifters and beam - splitters and , as such , can be constructed in the lab .",
    "remarkably , the example we have just considered also serves as a counterexample to the `` no - go '' conjecture  @xcite .",
    "the conjecture states that the largest noon state that can be produced from product inputs with only @xmath0 modes is that of @xmath0 photons .",
    "however , we have seen that there is a situation when the noon state of five photons can be generated in only four modes .",
    "in this work , we have shown how the problem of identifying a linear optical state preparation device can be formulated and solved using the language of polynomials . in this way",
    ", we do not have to include unitarity conditions as constraints on our system .",
    "instead , we solve the polynomial equations using the methods of algebraic geometry and later restore unitarity with a sacrifice of at most doubling the number of modes .",
    "we have introduced a general framework that allows for the systematic construction of linear optical devices preparing entangled quantum states of light .",
    "it is worth noting that in addition to solving the problem of state generation by linear - optical means , the technique we propose can also be used to construct optimal linear - optical quantum gates .",
    "with care taken to formulate appropriate equivalence classes , the problem of constructing a ( probabilistic ) linear - optical quantum gate involves the same system of equations , and hence can be solved using grbner bases and vacuum extensions . applied to gate construction , our solution scheme can be seen as the generalization of the procedure used to construct an optimal linear - optical ns gate in ref .  @xcite .",
