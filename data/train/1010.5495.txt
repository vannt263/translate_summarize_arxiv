    "therefore , it is crucial that the vector field is protected by a gauge symmetry so the longitudinal mode of the vector field excitations is not physical . on the other hand , because of the conformal invariance of models with gauge fields , any excitation of gauge field during inflation is diluted and can not seed the desired anisotropies .",
