    "<S> from a simple path integral involving a variable volatility in the velocity differences , we obtain velocity probability density functions with exponential tails , resembling those observed in fully developed turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> the model yields realistic scaling exponents and structure functions satisfying extended self - similarity . </S>",
    "<S> but there is an additional small scale dependence for quantities in the inertial range , which is linked to a slow approach to kolmogorov ( 1941 ) scaling occurring in the large distance limit .    </S>",
    "<S> .25in.25 in 8.5 in    the universal features displayed by fully developed hydrodynamic turbulence are still not fully understood . </S>",
    "<S> kolmogorov ( 1941 ) @xcite showed how a set of statistical quantities known as structure functions are expected depend on the length scale @xmath0 as power laws with predicted exponents . </S>",
    "<S> experimental measurements have indicated that while these predictions are close to the truth , the predicted exponents are not exactly realized . in the face of this experimental input , much effort has been devoted towards understanding the origin of these anomalies in the scaling exponents , while retaining the notion that current experiments are observing an `` inertial range '' where strict power law scaling holds .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we will investigate what appears to be a loop - hole in this reasoning . in spite of impressive advances made in the experimental studies </S>",
    "<S> , the fact remains that the scaling exponents have been deduced by looking at scaling regions extending over little more than one decade in @xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this leaves open the possibility that a small but significant departure from strict power law scaling is still consistent with the data . </S>",
    "<S> we will argue that this possible departure is sufficient to allow the observed anomalies in the exponents to be nothing more than a transient effect related to intermittency , and that the true power law scaling only occurs on larger scales . </S>",
    "<S> this very large distance scaling could take the form proposed by kolmogorov .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall present a model which predicts deviations from power law scaling , and which shows that these deviations may be small enough to have escaped detection thus far . </S>",
    "<S> the model is based on a simple physical picture for the effects of intermittency , which are effects due to the coming and going of coherent structures in the velocity field . </S>",
    "<S> we will model the effects that these structures ( eddies ) have directly on the probability distribution function ( pdf ) for velocity differences . </S>",
    "<S> we are claiming simplicity in our approach , but not uniqueness . </S>",
    "<S> thus the applicability to 3-dimensional hydrodynamical turbulence in particular could be considered speculative , since the model makes no mathematical contact with the navier - stokes equations . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> when the consequences of the model are explicitly worked out they are found to coincide rather well with the data .    </S>",
    "<S> only the symmetric part of the observed pdf will be modeled in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> this is denoted by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the difference in some velocity component at two points separated by a distance @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the model will yield an explicit expression for the pdf which 1 ) for small @xmath0 has the typical sharp peak and broad tails characteristic of intermittent behavior , 2 ) at any finite @xmath0 displays exponential tails at large enough @xmath2 , and 3 ) tends toward a gaussian form in the large @xmath0 limit . </S>",
    "<S> but the model shows that these realistic features may in fact be implying that the values of the scaling exponents are slightly scale dependent , as they evolve from their observed `` anomalous '' values for the values of @xmath0 where they are presently measured , to the pure k41 values in the large @xmath0 limit .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a discrete set of points on the line connecting the two points separated by distance @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we label the points by their distance from one end , @xmath3 where @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we start by assuming that @xmath1 can be approximated by @xmath5{\\cal p } ( v_{r}-   v_{r_{n}}){\\cal p } ( v_{r_{n}}- v_{r_{n-1}})\\cdots { \\cal p } ( v_{r_{1}}- v_{0 } ) , \\label{bb}\\ ] ] with @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the set of points @xmath7 is characterized by a scale @xmath8 such that @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is a positive constant to be determined below . </S>",
    "<S> the integration over all velocities at the intermediate points may be thought of as a sum over all paths in the space of velocities which start at @xmath12 and end at @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> we could thus refer to ( [ bb ] ) as a path integral . </S>",
    "<S> but note that we refrain from taking the continuum limit , @xmath14 with @xmath0 fixed , since the scale @xmath8 has a physical significance .    the discretization of the range from 0 to @xmath0 into subregions @xmath15 is associated with our modeling of intermittent behavior . </S>",
    "<S> roughly speaking , we are suggesting that the coming and going of eddies , of sizes comparable to subregion size @xmath16 , produce a _ variable volatility _ in the typical velocity differences @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> we make this statement precise by writing @xmath18 as a superposition of gaussians , where we integrate over all values of a volatility parameter @xmath19 which is itself weighted according to a gaussian . to simplify notation </S>",
    "<S> we denote @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21 the consideration of large and small values of @xmath19 corresponds to the possible presence or absence of eddies in that subregion at various times . </S>",
    "<S> note that the variance of both @xmath22 and @xmath23 is @xmath24 .    </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bb ] ) is constructed to give the cumulative effect of the variable volatilities occurring in the various subregions . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 should be typical of scales on which viscosity influences and damps the formation of eddies . </S>",
    "<S> as such @xmath8 is expected to lie between the dissipative ( kolmogorov ) scale , @xmath25 , and the lower end of the inertial scaling range ( the latter range being characterized by the absence of viscosity effects ) . note that if @xmath26 then the size of the subregion , @xmath16 , and thus the relevant eddy size for that subregion , would increase with @xmath27 .    </S>",
    "<S> we proceed by inserting ( [ dd ] ) into ( [ bb ] ) and integrating over the @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> we can write the terms in the exponential which depend on @xmath29 in matrix notation @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a matrix and @xmath32 is a vector , with the latter depending on @xmath33 and @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> we may complete the square and do the gaussian integrations over @xmath35 , for various values of @xmath36 . from this </S>",
    "<S> we are able to deduce a simple result , where all dependence on the @xmath19 now resides in @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath38 integrations for fixed @xmath39 then just give the surface area of an @xmath40 dimensional sphere . </S>",

    "<S> there is also a dynamical time scale associated with scale @xmath0 , the eddy turnover time , which is simply @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a typical velocity observed on scale @xmath0 . if we associate @xmath51 with @xmath52 from ( [ ee ] ) , and if the evolutionary and dynamical times happen to scale with @xmath0 in the same way , then we obtain @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> this gives the standard scaling law @xmath54 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now perform the integral over @xmath46 , and rescale the pdf such that the variance is unity for all @xmath43 . </S>",

    "<S> for @xmath64 we have `` deformed gaussians '' with exponential tails . for any @xmath43 , @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively we may consider moments , @xmath66 , which are all finite and given by @xmath67 the approach to the exponential tails is reflected in @xmath68 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is common to describe the evolution of the pdf with @xmath0 in terms of the generalized structure functions , defined by @xmath69 . for @xmath0 in the inertial range </S>",
    "<S> it is usually assumed that @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> our model suggests that exactly scale independent exponents do not exist for the typical ranges of @xmath0 considered , and that instead we should consider the local exponents @xmath71 . </S>",

    "<S> this asymmetry is reflected by the nonvanishing of the structure functions @xmath77 for odd @xmath78 . in particular </S>",
    "<S> our @xmath79 is not the same as the scaling exponent of @xmath80 , which is constrained to be unity @xcite .    in fig . </S>",

    "<S> the main point is that the scaling exponents approach their asymptotic values very slowly . </S>",
    "<S> it is also of interest that for some range of @xmath84 , our exponents are realistic for a wide range of @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> we show this by comparing to the model of she and leveque ( sl)@xcite , which yields @xmath85 , and which is known to fit the current data quite well . </S>",
    "<S> we may phrase the agreement in terms of the relative scaling exponents @xmath86 , which are known to better accuracy @xcite than the individual exponents , and for which the factor @xmath11 in ( [ ii ] ) cancels . </S>",
    "<S> we find , for example , that @xmath87 as a function of @xmath78 is within a few percent of the corresponding sl values up to @xmath88 ! and as @xmath0 varies from 20 to 50 , @xmath89 for example varies from 1.72 to 1.82 , compared to @xmath90 .    to see the @xmath0 dependence of the structure functions themselves we display @xmath91 in fig . </S>",

    "<S> but other than for @xmath96 , which is exactly straight , the lines have a positive curvature which increases for larger @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> we will see below how these positive curvatures , or equivalently the scale dependence of the scaling exponents , may be rather subtle to observe experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> but first we must consider the effects of viscosity on the structure functions .    </S>",
    "<S> we expect that the effects of viscosity will cause @xmath97 to be replaced by a function @xmath98 which deviates from @xmath99 as @xmath0 approaches the dissipative scale @xmath25 from above . </S>",
    "<S> since a decreasing @xmath43 corresponds to increasing intermittency , and since the cause of intermittency in our picture  variable volatility of velocity differences  should be damped by viscous effects , we expect that @xmath98 should start to decrease more slowly than @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the evolution of the pdf shapes is retarded by viscous effects in the `` intermediate viscous range '' , the range of @xmath0 between @xmath25 and the start of the inertial range . </S>",
    "<S> the implication is that at large scales in the inertial range where @xmath100 it is likely that @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> we may also expect that @xmath102 grows with the size of the intermediate viscous range </S>",
    "<S> .    for very small @xmath0 where the velocity field is smooth the variance is evolving like @xmath103 , faster than in the inertial range , and thus there must clearly be a decoupling between the evolution of the pdf shapes and the evolution of the pdf variance . </S>",
    "<S> we are thus led to a generalization of our model , where we replace the expression in ( [ aa ] ) by the following . would be determined by unit steps in the function @xmath104 . instead of each point , groups of adjacent points would have a single fluctuating volatility , and the transition from one grouping to the next would determined by unit steps in the function @xmath98 . ] </S>",

    "<S> our results are not very sensitive to precisely how these functions deviate from @xmath119 behavior outside the inertial range . </S>",
    "<S> note that the intermediate viscous range is larger for @xmath115 . </S>",

    "<S> for illustrative purposes only , we choose @xmath121 and @xmath122 .    with this input we can extract all higher order structure functions from ( [ gg ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> similar results are obtained for other choices of the functions @xmath98 and @xmath104 . </S>",

    "<S> we reiterate that the model yields a universal set of _ local _ scaling exponents , and the scaling exponent from an experiment depends on what distance scale , effectively , the local scaling exponent is being measured at relative to @xmath8 . on the other hand if it is true that @xmath102 increases with the size of the intermediate viscous region , as we are suggesting , then it may be difficult to obtain measurements at distances , in units of @xmath8 , which are very different from each other . </S>",
    "<S> the variability in the scaling exponents is also obscured if different experiments have intermediate viscous regions of similar size , and/or if one is confined to the lower order structure functions , such as @xmath135 and below .    </S>",

    "<S> but perhaps most important is that the model suggests how evidence for a slow approach to k41 scaling could eventually be uncovered . </S>",
