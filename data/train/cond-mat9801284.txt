    "one of the best known physical models for neural networks is the hopfield model @xcite . in theoretical investigations of network properties , e.g. , the retrieval of learned patterns",
    ", it plays a similar role as the ising model does in the theory of magnetism .",
    "extensions of this model to multi - state neurons have received a lot of attention recently ( see , e.g. , @xcite - @xcite and the references cited therein ) . thereby the ability to store and retrieve so - called grey - toned and coloured patterns has been investigated .    in this work",
    "we consider another extension of the hopfield model to allow for multi - functional neurons .",
    "the specific model we have in mind is the neural network version of the ashkin - teller spin - glass ( @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "indeed , on the one hand the ashkin - teller model has two different kinds of neurons ( spins ) at each site interacting with each other .",
    "this allows us to interprete this model as a neural network with two types of neurons having different functions . on the other hand , this ashkin - teller neural network ( atnn ) can be considered as a model consisting out of two interacting hopfield models .",
    "we expect the behaviour of the atnn to be different from the one of the hopfield model in a non trivial way .",
    "one of the things we want to find out , e.g. , is whether this ( four - neuron ) interaction between the two types of neurons can improve the retrieval process for embedded patterns built from these two types of neurons .",
    "we will see , indeed , that for a particular choice of this interaction term the retrieval quality of the embedded patterns is very high in comparison with a corresponding hopfield model .",
    "therefore , independent of the possible biological relevance of this model , if any , such a study is interesting from the pure physical point of view .    in this work",
    "we consider both the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of this model in the case of loading of a finite number of patterns .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : mod ] the atnn model is introduced .",
    "section [ sec : met ] discusses the methods used for analyzing both the equilibrium properties and the dynamics of the model . in particular , fixed - point equations as well as flow equations for the relevant macroscopic overlap order parameters are derived . in section [ sec : res ] numerical solutions of these equations are discussed for a representative set of network parameters .",

    "secondly , it is clear that the behaviour of this model ( [ eq : atnn0])-([eq : hebb ] ) might depend on the fact whether the @xmath13 are taken to be independent from the @xmath14 and the @xmath15 or not .",

    "we note that this atnn model can also be considered as an assembly of two single hopfield models ( when @xmath23 ) , one in the @xmath1-neurons and one in the @xmath24-neurons interconnected via a four - neuron interaction ( when @xmath25 ) .",
    "the study of coupled hopfield networks has aroused some interest in the literature before ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the following we discuss both the thermodynamics and the dynamics of this atnn neural network with low loading .",

    "@xcite such that the expressions ( [ eq : free])-([eq : els ] ) can also be read off from there .",
    "the fixed - point equations for the order parameters read @xmath34 where @xmath35 are taken to be different and where @xmath36 is the embedded pattern corresponding to @xmath37 .",
    "since the study of this atnn model is very involved we have restricted ourselves here to a detailed treatment of the mattis states ( @xcite ) which are especially important from a neural network point of view . in our case",
    "they are defined as those solutions of the fixed - point equations for which not more than one component of each order parameter is different from zero , e.g. @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "these states are denoted by @xmath41 in the sequel .",
    "we will see that those states are the only ones which contribute to the thermodynamics of the system .",
    "solutions with more than one component being non - zero , i.e. , mixture states will be important for the dynamics if they are local minima of the free energy .    for zero temperature",
    "we note that the eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ec2 ] ) can be simplified by replacing the @xmath42 by @xmath43 .",
    "then it is straightforward to show that for each order parameter @xmath44 with the equality being satisfied for a one - component @xmath37 , and that the ground - state energy is given by @xmath45 in section [ sec : res ] we report on the existence and stability of these mattis states as a function of the temperature .",

    "the stability matrix given by @xmath105 leads to the following main features . above @xmath106",
    "there exist no stable mattis states .",
    "furthermore , the ( paramagnetic ) state @xmath107 where all the overlaps with the embedded patterns are zero is stable .",

    "we expect that the most important ones are those with the lowest energies , i.e. the states @xmath108 ( for temperatures in the interval @xmath109 ) and @xmath110 ( for temperatures in @xmath111 ) .",
    "the state @xmath110 corresponds to a situation where the overlaps with a pattern in the @xmath112-part and @xmath113-part of the network are non - zero and equal to each other and the overlap with a pattern in the @xmath114-part of the network is zero .",
    "this state is completely equivalent to the states @xmath115 and @xmath116 , a fact resulting directly from the symmetry of the model .",
    "its properties are analogous to those of the mattis states in the hopfield model @xcite , since the fixed - point equations for the overlap @xmath117 are the same .",

    "however , such a retrieval occurs with a lot of errors as can be inferred from the small values of the corresponding overlap in fig .",
    "the second state , i.e. @xmath118 , which is , of course , equivalent to @xmath120 and @xmath121 differs from the @xmath108 state in this respect that the non - zero overlaps with the pattern in the three different parts of the network are not equal to each other . but",

    "( [ eq : muev ] ) . for simplicity",
    ", we take the number of embedded patterns of each type @xmath126 . since we have three different kinds of such patterns the results concern a six - dimensional flow .",
    "some representative two - dimensional projections are presented in fig .",
    "[ dynuc1 ] .    as a starting point",
    "we take @xmath127 and different values for @xmath128 .",
    "such a choice of initial conditions is not very specific because of the symmetry properties of the model .",
    "it allows us to show some typical behaviour of the network .",
    "an extensive search confirms that other initial conditions lead only to quantitatively different diagrams .",
    "we remark that the part of the diagrams not shown explicitly is symmetric with respect to the @xmath129 or @xmath130 axis .",
    "we choose some relevant values of @xmath131 suggested by the thermodynamics .",
    "we can locate in the first diagram of fig .",
    "[ dynuc1 ] ( @xmath132 ) the attractor @xmath116 in the lower left corner . in the lower right ( and ,",
    "since there is symmetry with respect to the off - diagonal also upper left ) corner we see the state @xmath121 , which looks like an attractor .",
    "however , our static analysis reveals that they are only saddle points in the full six - dimensional space . on the off - diagonal",
    "we have a state of the form @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 denoted by @xmath136 , i.e. , symmetric with respect to the @xmath112-part of the network .",
    "we remark that in this diagram some lines cross each other which is caused by the fact that only the evolution of two order parameters is shown whereas the third order parameter , @xmath137 , is also evolving .",
    "one could easily imagine a three - dimensional picture with @xmath137 taken as the third coordinate .    for increasing @xmath131",
    "the @xmath136 state is no longer present and the @xmath121 states move along the @xmath138-axis ( respectively @xmath139-axis ) until they disappear for @xmath140 . for these temperatures there is a very small difference in free energy between the various mattis - type states .",
    "this could be the reason that for @xmath141 we were no longer able to detect the states @xmath121 which should still exist according to the static analysis .",
    "indeed , at this temperature the overlap for the @xmath121 states is almost equal to the one for the @xmath108 state ( see fig .",
    "[ sol1 ] ) showing that they are almost identical .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath140 the states @xmath108 appear , move towards the origin on the @xmath138-axis ( respectively the @xmath139-axis ) as seen on the diagram for @xmath142 and disappear for @xmath106 . from this temperature",
    "onwards only the origin , i.e. the @xmath107 state is an attractor .",
    "next , we have analysed the model with linked patterns satisfying @xmath143 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 i.i.d.r.v . , and with equal coupling parameters @xmath102",
    ".    introducing again mattis - type states @xmath41 into the fixed - point equations ( [ eq : ec2 ] ) and checking their stability we find that there are only two stable solutions : the retrieval state @xmath108 which is stable below @xmath144 and the paramagnetic @xmath107 state which is stable above @xmath106 .",
    "the corresponding retrieval overlap is shown in fig .",
    "[ sol1 ] ( filled symbols ) .",
    "we notice that in contrast to the model with unlinked patterns a state of the form @xmath108 has a much bigger overlap .",
    "hence , we can distinguish different phases : a retrieval phase below @xmath144 and a paramagnetic phase above @xmath144 .",
    "we remark that the transition at @xmath144 is first order . in the temperature region",
    "@xmath145 both the paramagnetic and mattis solutions are local minima of the free energy .",
    "such a region has also been seen in the potts model but not in the hopfield model @xcite .",
    "finally , we find that hopfield - type solutions , i.e. , mattis states of the form @xmath146 are ( only ) saddle points below @xmath106 .",
    "a detailed study of the flow equations ( [ eq : muev ] ) reveals a much more complicated local minima structure for this model .",
    "it turns out that for the model with linked patterns we still have to distinguish between the mattis solutions according to the relative place of the non - zero overlap components for the different order parameters .",
    "consequently , we introduce _ simple _ mattis states where only the same components of the different order parameters are non - zero , e.g. , @xmath147 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 for @xmath126 , denoted as before by @xmath41 . for equal components @xmath148 these are the states we have encountered in the thermodynamic analysis .",
    "( they are equivalent to @xmath149 and also to @xmath150 ) .    besides , we define _ crossed _",
    "mattis states where never the same components of the different order parameters are non - zero , e.g. , @xmath151 for @xmath126 and @xmath152 for @xmath153 . at this point",
    "we remark that a state of the form @xmath154 is neither simple nor crossed but of a mixed form . for @xmath126 we did not detect the latter .",
    "the crossed states are in fact equivalent to mattis states for a model with unlinked patterns .",
    "this can easily be checked by introducing this type of solutions in the fixed - point equations for the order parameters and taking appropriate averages over the linked patterns .",
    "some representative flow diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ dync1 ] and fig .",
    "[ dync2 ] . as before we present only projections onto a two - dimensional space .",
    "the symmetry of the model with linked patterns is different from the model with unlinked patterns what results in a different symmetry of the flow diagrams .",
    "so , the remaining part of a diagram in these figures can be obtained by a reflection of the part displayed with respect to the axis @xmath155 .",
    "the initial conditions for the flow diagrams of fig .",
    "[ dync1 ] are as follows : two identical mattis states with @xmath156 .",
    "we can locate in the first diagram of fig .",
    "[ dync1 ] ( @xmath132 ) the attractor @xmath108 in the lower right corner . in the lower left corner",
    "we see the state @xmath146 , which again looks like an attractor .",
    "however , it is only a saddle point in the full six - dimensional space . on the top in the middle",
    "we have a state of the form @xmath157 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 denoted by @xmath158 , i.e. , asymmetric with respect to the @xmath112-part of the network .",
    "we remark that also here any crossings of paths are caused by the fact that the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ dync1 ] and also of fig .",
    "[ dync2 ] are projections of a higher dimensional flow .",
    "they are not present in the full six - dimensional space .    for higher @xmath131",
    "the state @xmath158 disappears , the state @xmath108 stays in the lower right corner up to @xmath122 and the state @xmath146 moves towards the origin and disappears at @xmath122 . above @xmath122 ( see the diagram for @xmath159 ) both the origin and the state @xmath108 are stable , but the latter has already moved towards the origin .",
    "we note that in contrast with the model with unlinked patterns , it does not reach the origin since the transition ( to the paramagnetic phase ) is first order .",
    "another illustrative set of diagrams is presented in fig .",
    "[ dync2 ] . here",
    "the initial conditions are more general : @xmath160 , @xmath161 . in the first diagram for @xmath132",
    "an attractor @xmath108 is present in the lower left and right corner . on the top in the middle",
    "the state @xmath110 is located .",
    "it is a crossed state and a minimum at low temperatures .",
    "the overlap @xmath117 in this state depends on @xmath131 in the same way as the overlap of a mattis solution of the standard hopfield model does .",
    "for higher @xmath131 this crossed state disappears but the @xmath108 states nearly stay at the same place until @xmath122 .",
    "above , the origin is an attractor and the @xmath108 states start to move towards the origin ( see the diagram for @xmath159 ) .",
    "as explained above they do not reach the origin .",
    "the interesting conclusion of these figures is that the state @xmath108 has a big basin of attraction .",
    "the latter is , of course , somewhat reduced in the temperature region where also the stable state @xmath107 appears .",
    "furthermore , the state @xmath108 has a large overlap ( recall fig .",
    "[ sol1 ] ) with the embedded patterns .",
    "since the atnn model with linked patterns seems to have very good retrieval properties it is worthwhile to derive a @xmath162 phase diagram .",
    "we first note that the fixed - point equations ( [ eq : ec2 ] ) for the simple mattis states have the same form as those for the mean - field ashkin - teller model . because these states are always the global minima of the free energy they determine the transition lines .",
    "of course the meaning of the phases is different from the standard ashkin - teller model .",
    "for the special case of one embedded pattern , i.e. , @xmath163 , with @xmath164 both models are completely equivalent .    the atnn @xmath162 phase diagram ( for low loading of linked patterns ) is presented in fig .  [ missing ] .",
    "we distinguish the following phases .",
    "the area in dark grey is the paramagnetic @xmath107 phase .",
    "the light shadowed area is the full retrieval phase ( for linked patterns ) described by the simple mattis state @xmath118 ( @xmath165 when @xmath166 ) .",
    "the white area represents a partial retrieval phase , i.e. , only patterns embedded in one part of the network are recalled by the state @xmath167 .",
    "the ( thick ) full lines indicate second order transitions , the ( thick ) dashed lines discontinuous ones .",
    "we remark that the @xmath107 state exists as a minimum up to the thin full lines , but outside the dark grey region its energy is higher than the energy of the @xmath118 state . in part of the full retrieval phase , namely in the upper half of the phase diagram , the crossed state @xmath110 exists .",
    "it is stable in the area above the thin full and thin dashed lines .",
    "we have analysed a neural network version of the ashkin - teller spin - glass model for low loading of patterns .",
    "both the thermodynamic and dynamic properties have been considered , especially for mattis states which are the most interesting states from the point of view of retrieval .",
    "fixed - point equations as well as flow equations for the relevant order parameters have been derived .",
    "numerical results have been discussed illustrating the typical behaviour of the network .",
    "the following main conclusions can be drawn .",
    "for unlinked embedded patterns the behaviour of the model is much richer than in the case of the standard hopfield model in the sense that many different forms of stable mattis states are possible .",
    "these states exist up to @xmath122 where a continuous transition occurs from the retrieval phase to the paramagnetic phase .",
    "the corresponding flow diagrams are quite complicated but verify the existence of these many attractors .",
    "however , none of these retrieval states has a bigger overlap than the mattis states of a corresponding hopfield model .",
    "hence the inclusion of the four - neuron interaction term does not particularly improve the quality of retrieval .    for linked embedded patters",
    "interesting new features show up .",
    "the most important one is that stable mattis states of the form @xmath108 appear .",
    "they have a very big overlap with the embedded patterns , meaning that the pairs of patterns which are linked by the four - neuron term are retrieved with a very high accuracy .",
    "furthermore , they exist up to @xmath144 and have a big basin of attraction . for temperatures @xmath168 both these mattis states and the paramagnetic solution are local minima of the free energy such that their basin of attraction is somewhat reduced .",
    "to verify then that this big overlap @xmath117 is not just a rescaled overlap of the corresponding mattis state of a corresponding hopfield model we have made a comparison in fig .",
    "we clearly see the difference in shape in favour of the atnn .",
    "further details of additional features of the atnn model are given in a @xmath162 phase diagram ( see fig .  [ missing ] ) . in brief , the linked pairs are retrieved easily and with a high precision ( simple states ) and the unlinked pairs may be retrieved ( crossed states ) , but always with lower precision than that of the linked ones .",
    "it is important to stress that the patterns which are linked can be completely different . in principle",
    ", they are independent .",
