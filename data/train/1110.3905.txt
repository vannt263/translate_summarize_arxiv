    "unusual suspects for extragalactic high - energy @xmath0-ray emission begin to arise from the shadows : the _",
    "fermi_/lat  collaboration recently reported the discovery of high - energy @xmath0-ray from the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) , our neighbouring galaxy @xcite .",
    "more powerful sources , particularly active galactic nuclei ( agns ) with relativistic jets pointing close to the line of sight , the so - called blazars , represent the major part of extragalactic sources detected with _",
    "fermi_/lat  ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    however , weaker sources such as starburst galaxies begin to be revealed as high - energy emitters , both in the gev and tev ranges , like m82 @xcite and ngc253 @xcite .",
    "starburst , seyfert and normal galaxies have long been thought to marginally contribute to the extragalactic diffuse @xmath0-ray emission ( see e.g. @xcite ) , however recent studies tend to re - evaluate this contribution to be largely significant , if not dominant , compared to the emission from blazars ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we present here a study on the search for high - energy @xmath0-ray emission from normal , nearby galaxies from the local group , in order to investigate any signature from cosmic rays interactions with the interstellar medium in the host galaxy , as opposed to the emission from agns .",
    "high - energy emission from some galaxies of the local group has been reported for the small magellanic cloud ( smc , @xcite ) , the large magellanic cloud ( lmc , @xcite ) , m31 @xcite , the starbursts m82 and ngc253 @xcite , and cena @xcite .",
    "we study here the major galaxies from the local group for which no high - energy emission has been reported so far : m81 , m83 , ic342 , maffei1 , maffei2 , and m94 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     a _",
    "fermi_/lat  data analysis is performed for the sources in our sample using the public data from august 4 , 2008 to january 1 , 2011 .",
    "we use the unbinned likelihood analysis @xcite from the publicly available _ science tools _ version ` v9r18p6 ` .",
    "data from the diffuse class events are selected , using the ` p6_v3 ` instrumental response functions , in the 200mev200gev energy range .",
    "the isotropic ` isotropic_iem_v02 ` model is used to account for both the extragalactic diffuse emission and residual instrumental background , while the model ` gll_iem_v02 ` accounts for the contribution from the galactic diffuse emission .",
    "the region of interest is taken from a circular region of 10@xmath1 of radius around the nominal positions of the sources in our sample , while all the neighbouring sources up to 15@xmath1 from the 11 months point source catalogue ( 1fgl , @xcite ) are accounted for in the modelled reconstruction of the sources .",
    "the ` gtlike ` tool is used to assess the detection level of the studied objects , for all of which the test statistics ( ts ) are found to be below 25 , resulting in no significant detection .",
    "upper limits at 2@xmath2 confidence level are thus derived on their flux in the 200mev200gev energy range .",
    "no specific energy spectra are assumed to derive these limits , and the corresponding photon indices are left free to vary in the models .",
    "table  [ tab - ana_results ] presents a summary of our results for m81 , m83 , ic342 , maffei1 , maffei2 , and m94 , as well as previous results obtained on ngc1068 and ngc4945 @xcite and on the milky way , lmc , smc , m31 , m33 , m82 and ngc253 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "more details on specific sources from the sample can be found in @xcite .",
    "interactions between cosmic rays accelerated in stellar objects ( e.g. supernovremnants ) and the ambient interstellar medium in starburst and normal galaxies are expected to generate high - energy @xmath0-ray emission , through pion decay for hadronic cosmic rays as well as inverse compton and bremsstrahlung radiations from leptonic cosmic rays ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the supernova rate @xmath3  and the total gas mass @xmath4  in a given galaxy could be a proxy for the expected @xmath0-ray luminosity , through the relationship :    @xmath5    scaled with the supernova rate in the milky way @xmath6 and the distance of the considered galaxy @xmath7 .",
    "figure  [ fig - relation ] shows the @xmath0-ray luminosity measured with _",
    "fermi_/lat  for the known high - energy emitting starburst and normal galaxies , against @xmath8 , as well as the upper limits on the fluxes for the objects studied here which are not detected .",
    "the luminosities expected from the model of @xcite are also depicted in red , accounting for the observational uncertainties on @xmath3  and @xmath4  for the different objects . for comparison",
    ", we also added in this plot the @xmath0-ray luminosity for the seyfert2 galaxy ngc1068 recently detected at high energies @xcite .",
    "ngc1068 also harbours a starburst region in its central part , but it was argued in @xcite that its high - energy emission more likely originates from the agn activity .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - relation ] that the upper limit reported on m33 by the _ fermi_/lat  collaboration @xcite is very stringent compared to expectation , if the high - energy flux is truly directly connected to @xmath8 , i.e. if the high - energy emission is only due to cosmic ray interactions with the interstellar medium , without any other contribution . in this case , a detection of m33 with _",
    "fermi_/lat  should be imminent .",
    "a non - detection of m33 in the future years could be an indication for e.g. a particularly efficient electron escape in this galaxy , partly suppressing the high - energy emission .",
    "it can be noted from fig .",
    "[ fig - relation ] that the same applies to m83 , which should also be detectable soon with _ fermi_/lat . apart from the peculiar case of ngc1068 for which the @xmath0-ray emission may be dominated by the agn activity , the observations for the other sources reported here are fully consistent with expectations from the model of @xcite .",
    "an alternative scenario can be invoked for expected high - energy emission from normal galaxies .",
    "indeed @xcite recently reported the discovery of giant @xmath0-ray bubbles in the inner milky way , and an extensive discussion on different possible mechanisms for their origin can be found e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the emission from these giant bubbles more likely comes from inverse compton scattering of a hard population of galactic cosmic ray electrons , the latter may also be at the origin of the microwave haze seen with _ wmap _ @xcite .",
    "if such emission from giant bubbles occurs in other normal galaxies , one could expect to detect that signal in galaxies from the local group , in addition to the emission discussed above , which would result in a higher @xmath0-ray flux compared to what is expected from the model of @xcite .",
    "such hypothesis can already be ruled out in the peculiar case of m33 , owing to the constraining upper limit reported on its @xmath0-ray flux",
    ".    high - energy emission could also arise from a third hypothesis .",
    "collective emission from galactic sources within the host galaxies , such as pulsars , pulsar wind nebul  or supernova remnants , could be detected in nearby galaxies .",
    "to evaluate the contribution of such emission , we estimate the expected flux for this collective emission using the @xmath0-ray luminosities for pulsars and pulsar wind nebul  currently detected with _ fermi_/lat  ( see @xcite for more details ) , assuming these galactic objects are located in a hypothetical galaxy distant by 3mpc , which is the mean distance for the sources in our sample .",
    "the modelled flux was intentionally over - estimated by assuming 1000 such sources in the host galaxy , which is much more numerous than the @xmath960 similar objects currently detected with _",
    "fermi_/lat  in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "even with such optimistic conditions , the collective flux from pulsars is computed to be @xmath10@xmath11 , and the one for pulsar wind nebul  amounts to @xmath12@xmath11 .",
    "these estimates are well below the sensitivity achievable by _",
    "fermi_/lat  within 2 years of observations .",
    "the contribution from collective emission of galactic objects in the host galaxy is thus found to be negligible compared to the one from cosmic ray interactions with the local interstellar medium .",
    "high - energy @xmath0-ray emission from normal galaxies of the local group has been searched for .",
    "no normal galaxy has been detected at high energy yet , apart from m31 @xcite .",
    "we derived upper limits on their flux , which are found to be fully compatible with expectations from the model of @xcite for cosmic ray interactions with the local interstellar medium .",
    "if this model holds , a detection should be imminent with _",
    "fermi_/lat  for m33 and m83 .",
    "the expected @xmath0-ray flux of the other sources in the sample are below the sensitivity of _",
    "fermi_/lat , in accordance with @xcite who estimated that @xmath95 normal galaxies should be individually detectable in the _ fermi_/lat  lifetime .",
    "this research has made use of nasa s astrophysics data system ( ads ) , of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france , and of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration ."
