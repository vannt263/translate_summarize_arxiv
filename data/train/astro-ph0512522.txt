    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are known to be variable on different time scales across the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "photometric studies of intensity variations in agns provide a uniquely powerful tool for investigating the processes occurring in the vicinity of their central engine . in particular , studies of very rapid intensity variations , or intra - night optical variability ( inov ) , where the variations have amplitudes of a few hundredths of a magnitude on hour - like or shorter time scales ,",
    "enable us to probe their innermost nuclear cores , on the scales of microarcseconds .",
    "blazars define a class of agns made up of optically violent variable quasars , high polarization quasars and bl lac objects .",
    "they show high polarization and violent variability at optical wavelengths , and in the radio band contain compact flat spectrum sources which often exhibit apparent superluminal motion and a high polarization level .",
    "these characteristics are generally attributed to synchrotron emission from a relativistic jet with the jet axis oriented at small angles to the observer s line of sight .",
    "theoretical explanations for the origin of inov can be broadly divided into intrinsic and extrinsic categories .",
    "one such extrinsic mechanism is refractive interstellar scintillation ( e.g. , kedziora - chudczer et al .",
    "1997 ) , though this is relevant only in the radio band .",
    "another proposed extrinsic mechanism is superluminal microlensing ( gopal - krishna & subramanian 1991 ) , which can explain the rapidity of variations , though it is unlikely to apply to a large fraction of blazars .",
    "the dominant basic model for intrinsic variability invokes shocks propagating through the jet ( e.g. , blandford & knigl 1979 ; marscher & gear 1985 ) .",
    "models designed to explain inov based on jets involve turbulence behind the jet ( marscher , gear & travis 1992 ) , light echo effects ( qian et al .",
    "1991 ) , helical filaments ( rosen 1990 ) or changing directions of the shocks in the jet ( gopal - krishna & wiita 1992 ; nesic et al .",
    "the effectiveness of all these models are enhanced by relativistic effects in the jet , especially when the viewing angle is small .",
    "another family of intrinsic explanations invokes numerous flares or hot spots on the surface of ( or in the corona above ) the accretion disk ( e.g. , mangalam & wiita 1993 ) .",
    "similar models have been proposed to explain the x - ray variations of agn ( e.g. , abramowicz et al .",
    "while such disk perturbations are unlikely to dominate blazar variability they may propagate into or otherwise affect jet dominated emission ( e.g. , wiita 2005 ) .",
    "s5 0716@xmath3714 , classified as a bl lac object , was discovered in the bonn - nrao radio survey ( khr et al .",
    "1981 ) of flat spectrum radio sources with a 5 ghz flux greater than 1 jy .",
    "it is believed to be at a redshift z @xmath4 0.3 ( wagner et al . 1996 ) due to the lack of the detection of its host galaxy ; however , a lower value of z @xmath2 0.1 has also been suggested recently ( kadler et al .",
    "this source , an intra - day variable at radio and optical wavelengths as well as a @xmath5-ray emitter ( wagner et al .",
    "1996 ) , is a favourite target for variability studies . in a 4 week long monitoring campaign in february 1990 , this blazar showed an abrupt transition in its variability pattern from a higher flux level with roughly 1-day time scale during the first week , to a lower flux level with approximately 7-day time scale for the remainder of the campaign , both at optical and centimeter wavelengths ( quirrenbach et al .",
    "another interesting result is that the radio spectral index of this blazar was found to correlate with intra - night optical variations such that a flattening of the radio spectrum near the optical maxima was found for several quasi - cycles ( qian et al .",
    "1996 ; wagner et al .",
    "1996 ) . the intriguing evidence for correlated variability in the radio and optical ranges ( quirrenbach et al .",
    "1991 ; wagner et al . 1996 ) certainly points to an intrinsic origin of the variations in this blazar .",
    "these authors further inferred that the _ r _ band light curves evinced a significant signature of flickering on time scales as short as 15 minutes , much faster than the apparent quasi - periodic time scales .",
    "raiteri et al . ( 2003 ) present results on multi - band optical observations ranging from 1994@xmath02001 and also present radio observations spanning more than 20 years .",

    "( 1997 ) and sagar et al .",
    "( 1999 ) too have reported results of monitoring of this blazar in bvri colours during february to april 1994 .",
    "their campaigns recorded a few events of inov with an amplitude of about 5% within a few hours , superposed on slower variations .    in order to further investigate the inov behaviour of this blazar",
    ", we carried out a two weeks long optical monitoring campaign during april 1996 .",

    "these data , in conjunction with our additional observations during 2000@xmath001 , are used here to investigate both short - term and long - term variability of this prominent blazar .",
    "bl lac ( 2200@xmath3420 ) , the prototype of this class of agns , was identified by schmitt ( 1968 ) with the radio source vro 42.22.01 , and its spectrum was found to be featureless by viswanathan ( 1969 )",
    ". however , a broad @xmath6 line with ew @xmath4 5   was later detected by vermeulen et al .",
    "it is found to be embedded in an elliptical host galaxy ( wurtz , stocke & yee 1996 ) with @xmath7 .",
    "though large amplitude variations on time scales ranging from days to decades ( webb et al .  1988 ) and rapid variations of 0.1 mag / hr ( racine 1970 ) were already known , the advent of ccds used as n - star photometers conclusively demonstrated inov in bl lac ( miller et al .",
    "these authors report rapid changes in the _ v _ band flux on time scales as short as 1.5 hrs .",
    "it brightens almost every year and was reported to be in the active state in 2001 by mattei et al .",
    "we carried out intra - night bvr monitoring of this blazar for 5 nights in october 2001 .",
    "although optical variability on hour - like time scales is now a well established phenomenon for blazars , its relationship to the long - term variability remains unclear .",
    "possible clues could come from monitoring the optical spectrum for correlations with brightness .",
    "s5 0716 + 714 has been intensively studied for variability across the electromagnetic spectrum on various time scales ( see wu et al . 2005 and references therein ; nesci et al .",
    "on inter - night time scales a bluer when brighter correlation was found when the object was in an active or flaring state , but this trend was absent during its relatively quiescent state ( wu et al . 2005 ) . also , during one night s monitoring , wu et al .",
    "( 2005 ) noticed no spectral hardening with brightness .    during a 11-day long intra - night monitoring campaign of bl lac during a major outburst in july 1997 , clear evidence for the object to become bluer when brighter",
    "was noted by clements & carini ( 2001 ) .",
    "however , they interpreted this as an artefact of an increased contribution from the host galaxy when the blazar was fainter .",
    "in contrast , based on their bri photometry of bl lacertae on 5 nights during 1999 and 2001 , papadakis et al .",
    "( 2003 ) argued that spectral hardening with increasing brightness is evident even after the contribution from the host galaxy is subtracted , hinting that the effect is intrinsic to the blazar .",
    "the same significant trend was independently reported by villata et al .",
    "( 2004 ) from the intra - night monitoring of bl lacertae in ubvri bands .",
    "they also noted that this colour  brightness correlation is much weaker for the long - term brightness variations , which were nearly achromatic on a few day - like time scale .",

    "( 2003 ) who found a tendency for bluer colour at higher luminosity for all of them ; however , for their dataset , bl lac showed a fairly strong correlation while 0716@xmath3714 showed a weaker one .",
    "if the trend of spectral hardening with increasing brightness is confirmed to be ( nearly ) universal , at least for the variations on hour - like time scales , one interesting explanation posits short - term fluctuations of only the electron injection spectral index ( e.g. , mastichiadis & kirk 2002 ; bttcher & reimer 2004 ) .",
    "however , some blazars are found to show anomalous spectral behaviour ( see ramrez et al .",

    "based on the published long - term light curves of both these blazars ( raiteri et al .",
    "2003 ; villata et al .  2004 ; nesci et al .",
    "2005 ) , the present inov observations are seen to coincide with their relatively faint optical states .",
    "nonetheless , two clear events of inov , one of brightening , and the other of fading , were observed in s5 0716@xmath3714 .",
    "the events are well fitted with an exponential intensity profile with essentially the same rate of variation in the _ v _ and _ r _ bands .",
    "we note a hint of a possible temporal lag of @xmath210 minutes between these two bands with the shorter wavelength leading the longer , as expected in the standard shock - in - jet model ; such a lag is not expected in most disk - based variability models ( e.g. , wiita 2005 ) . in the present eight nights of our monitoring of s5 0716@xmath3714 spanning about a fortnight , two noticeable events of inter - night variability ( one around jd 2450180 and the other around jd 2450188 ) of amplitude @xmath1 0.2 mag were found .",
    "our long - term monitoring of this blazar , on the other hand , coincided with the maximum brightness phase seen in the lightcurve covering 1994@xmath02001 , as reported by raiteri et al .",

    "a large 1.5 magnitude flare is detected around jd 2451875 lasting for about 75 days .",
    "this is followed by a weaker variation on a similar timescale .",
    "no clear evidence of colour variation with brightness was found in either our inter - night or our intra - night monitoring of s5 0716 + 714 .",
    "the other blazar , bl lacertae , was found to vary strongly in all three bands ( b , v , r ) , on one of the five nights we monitored it and in two of the three bands on two other nights . also , on the night when strong inov was observed in all three bands , a temporal lag between the _ v _ and _ r _ band lightcurves may be present , with the _ v _ band variations apparently leading the _ r _ band variations by a few minutes .",
    "nesci et al .",
    "( 1998 ) also noted that no time lag between different bands could be unambiguously detected during intra - night monitoring observations of bl lac in 1997 .",
    "a clear trend was seen in our data for the source to become bluer when brighter on intra - night time scales .",
    "such a clear trend was not evident on inter - night time scales , although the data suggest one may be present .",
    "the presence ( or absence ) of this consistency between the colour - magnitude behaviour on intra - night and inter - night time scales can provide interesting clues about the origin of blazar variability from hour - like to much longer time sales .",
    "in view of this , sustained efforts for multi - colour monitoring of blazars on different time scales will be fruitful .    14.9 mag . ]",
