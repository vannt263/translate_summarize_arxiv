    "the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) was first discovered in the early 1960 s ( giacconi et  al . 1962 ) , several years before the detection of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ; penzias & wilson 1965 ) .",
    "however , unlike the cmb , which is truly diffuse in origin , the cxb is dominated by the emission from high - energy distant point sources : active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , the sites of intense black - hole growth that reside at the centers of galaxies ( see brandt & hasinger 2005 ; brandt & alexander 2010 for reviews ) . a key goal of high - energy astrophysics is to determine the detailed composition of the cxb in order to understand the evolution of agns .",

    "the _ nustar _ extragalactic survey is comprised of three components ( see table  6 of harrison et  al .",

    "these ten sources were selected from _ nustar _ observations taken up until january 31st 2013 .",
    "the selection of these sources for spectroscopic follow - up observations was based on their visibility to ground - based telescopes and they should therefore be representative of the overall high - energy source population .",

    "we searched for serendipitous sources in all of the six images ( i.e. ,  the three energy bands for each fpm ) using wavdetect ( freeman et  al . 2002 ) with an initial false - positive probability threshold of @xmath29 and wavelet scales of 4 , 5.66 , 8 , 11.31 , and 16 pixels . to be considered a reliable _ nustar _ source",
    "we require a detection to satisfy at least one of two criteria : ( 1 ) to be detected in at least one of the three images for both fpma and fpmb or ( 2 ) to be detected in at least one of the three images in a single fpm but to have a lower - energy x - ray counterpart ( e.g. ,  detected by _",

    "the choice of aperture is dictated by the brightness of the source and how close it lies to another source ; see table  2 for the adopted aperture of each source .",
    "these measurements provide the gross source counts , which we correct for background counts to provide the net source counts . to obtain a good sampling of the background counts while minimising the contribution to the background from the source counts , we measured the background in source - free regions using at least four circular apertures of 45@xmath32 or 60@xmath32 radius at least 90@xmath32 from the source .",
    "the gross source counts are corrected for the background counts to give the net source counts , rescaling for the different sizes of the source and background regions .",
    "errors on the net source counts are determined as the square root of the gross source counts .",
    "upper limits are calculated when a source is not detected in one of the six images or if the net counts are less than the 1  @xmath33 uncertainty ; 3  @xmath33 upper limits are calculated as 3 times the square root of the gross source counts .",

    "we also used xspec and the rmf and arf to determine the relationship between count rate , x - ray spectral slope , and source flux in each of the three energy bands : 324  kev , 38  kev , and 824  kev .",
    "we calculated the source fluxes in the three energy bands using the observed count rate and the derived x - ray spectral slope ; for the faint _ nustar _ sources with @xmath34 net counts summed over the two fpms , we set the x - ray spectral slope to @xmath15 , consistent with the average x - ray spectral slope of the overall sample ( see  4.3 ) .",

    "2004 ) at the gemini - south 8  m telescope to observe nustar  j011042 - 4604.2 in the hlx  1 field .",
    "we observed the source for 1200  s , split into two exposures dithered by 50    in central wavelength to fill in the chip gap in the focal plane .",

    "the optical spectrum reveals an agn at @xmath405 with somewhat broadened emission , weak [ ] emission , and a strong 4000    break with well - detected ca  h+k absorption lines .",
    "the best - fitting sed solution suggests that the agn dominates the uv  mir emission .",

    "there is weak evidence for emission from this source in the _ nustar _ images .",
