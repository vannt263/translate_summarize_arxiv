    "the origin and nature of the observed cosmic ray events with energies beyond 10@xmath9ev remains a mystery .",
    "up to now , more than 55 with @xmath10 ev have been detected ( takeda et al . 1999 ) , and the similarities of their air showers with those of cosmic rays at lower energies suggest that they could be mostly protons ( protheroe 1999 ) , although the possibility that they are heavy nuclei , @xmath11rays , neutrinos , or exotic particles can not be totally ruled out at the present .",
    "if these ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) are mostly protons , then they should be affected by the expected greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) energy cutoff ( @xmath12 ev for protons ) , due photo - pion production by interactions with the cosmic microwave background radiation , unless they are originated at distances closer than about 50 mpc ( e.g. , protheroe & johnson 1995 , medina tanco , de gouveia dal pino & horvath 1997 ) . on the other hand , if the they are protons from nearby sources ( located within @xmath13 50 mpc ) , then they should be little deflected by the intergalactic and galactic magnetic fields and point toward their sources ( e.g. , stanev 1997 , medina tanco , de gouveia dal pino & horvath 1998 ) .",
    "magnetic confinement of uhecr by the galaxy is very difficult since the larmour radius for a proton with energy @xmath14 ev is of the order of few @xmath15 kpc , and the present data although statistically modest , also seem to indicate an extragalactic origin for the uhecr events .",
    "there is no significant large - scale anisotropy related to the galactic disk , halo , or the local distribution of galaxies , although some clusters of events seem to point to the supergalactic plane ( takeda et al .",
    "1999 ) .    in an attempt to disentangle the puzzle presented by the detection of these particles with extremely high energies ,",
    "several source candidates and acceleration mechanisms have been invoked , but all of them have their limitations ( see , e.g. , protheroe 1999 , blandford 2000 , and olinto 2000 , 2001 , for reviews ) .",
    "the proposed models can be separated in two classes : ( i ) the so called astrophysical zevatrons , or @xmath16 models , which involve searching for acceleration sites in known astrophysical objects that can reach the required zev energies , such as compact sources with high magnetic fields and rotation rates , or powerful shocks ; and ( ii ) the @xmath17 models that involve the decay of high mass relics from the early universe . among the zevatrons , shock acceleration in the radio lobes and jets of powerful radio sources and agns",
    "may appear as an attractive possibility ( e.g. , rachen & biermann 1993 ) , but the lack of direct correlation of the arrival directions of most of the observed uhecrs events with nearby radio galaxies or agns poses some difficulties to these candidates . among the top - down models , the production of uhecrs by hadronization of quarks and glouns generated during the evaporation of primordial black holes located mainly at an extended galactic halo has been recently examined as an alternative possibility ( barrau 1999 ) .",
    "other potential zevatrons are unipolar inductors , like millisecond pulsars with very strong magnetic fields ( b @xmath18 g ) , or magnetars .",
    "particles can , in principle , extract the required energies from an induced e.m.f . across the few open field lines of a rapidly rotating magnetar , although a large electric field parallel to the magnetic field can be easily shorted by electron - positron pairs . alternatively , the particles can be accelerated in reconnection sites of magnetic loops produced , e.g. , by parker instability , on the surface of a magnetar ( medina tanco , de gouveia dal pino & horvath 1997 ) , but the accelerated particles will probably lose most of their energy gain by curvature radiation while dragged along by the magnetic dipole field ( sorrell 1987 ) .    to overcome these difficulties imposed by acceleration in regions located close to the surface of a pulsar , in a recent work ( de gouveia dal pino & lazarian 2000 , hereafter paper i ) ,",
    "we have speculated that uhecrs could be mostly protons accelerated in magnetic reconnection sites @xmath19 the magnetosphere of newborn millisecond pulsars produced by accretion induced collapse ( aic ) of a white dwarf ( e.g. , woosley & baron 1992 and references therein ) .",
    "as stressed in paper i , the accretion flow spins up the star and confines the magnetosphere to a radius @xmath20 where both plasma stress in the accretion disk , and magnetic stress balance ( arons 1993 ) . at this radius , which also defines the inner radius of the accretion disk , the equatorial flow diverts into a funnel inflow along the closed field - lines toward the star , and a centrifugally driven wind outflow ( gosh & lamb 1978 , arons 1986 , shu et al .",
    "1999 ) . to mediate the geometry of dipole - like field lines of the star with those opened by the wind and those trapped by the funnel inflow emanating from the @xmath20 region ,",
    "a surface of null poloidal field lines is required .",
    "it is labeled as `` @xmath21 @xmath22 '' in figure 1a .",
    "( see also fig . 1 of paper i ) .",
    "across the null surface , the poloidal field suffers a sharp reversal of direction . according to the ampre s law",
    ", large electric currents must flow out of the plane shown in figure 1a , along the null surfaces , and in the presence of finite electric resistivity , dissipation of these currents will lead to reconnection of the oppositely directed field lines ( e.g. , biskamp 1997 , vishniac & lazarian 1998 ) . helmet streamers ( or flare loops ) are also present in the magnetic field configuration of the solar corona . the magnetic energy released by reconnection in",
    "the helmet streamer drives violent outward motions in the surrounding plasma that accelerate copious amounts of solar cosmic rays without producing many photons ( reames 1995 )",
    ". a similar process may take place in the helmet streamer of young born aic - pulsars .",
    "the particular mechanism of particle acceleration during reconnection events is still unclear in spite of numerous attempts to solve the problem ( see larosa et al 1996 , litvinenko 1996 ) .",
    "cosmic rays from the sun confirm that the process is sufficiently efficient in spite of the apparent theoretical difficulties for its explanation .",
    "in this situation we attempt to place constraints on the geometry of the magnetic field at the reconnection sites and identify the most promissing processes that can provide uhecr acceleration at aic - pulsars . we have argued in paper i that protons could be accelerated to the ultra high energies in aic - pulsars by the large induced electric field within the reconnection region ( e.g. , haswell , tajima , & sakai 1992 , litvinenko 1996 ) .",
    "this allowed us to obtain a flux of uhecrs which was consistent with the observations , but the physics of the acceleration process itself was not discussed there . in this paper , we investigate the potential acceleration mechanisms in the reconnection site .",
    "we first examine the conditions at which the rate of magnetic reconnection itself can be maximized in the presence of anomalous resistivity ( 2 ) .",
    "then , we show that first - order fermi acceleration in the reconnection site is possible , but it can not produce uhecrs because of the synchrotron losses that the particles experience in the strong magnetic fields of the pulsars ( 3 ) .",
    "we finally formulate the necessary constraints on the magnetic field geometry in order to enable one - shot acceleration by the induced electric field in the reconnection region , re - evaluate the expected uhecr spectrum and flux ( 4 ) , and conclude with a brief discussion of the implications of our results ( 5 ) .",
    "the commonly referred problem in classical reconnection schemes is that they use to provide too slow reconnection rates .",
    "for instance , sweet - parker reconnection implies a reconnection rate that is smaller than the alfvn speed by a factor @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the magnetic reynolds number .",
    "this factor can be as small as @xmath25 in the ism , and makes the reconnection rate extremely slow .",
    "very slow reconnection rates would make the losses too large and the acceleration inefficient . however , there is ample observational evidence that reconnection in astrophysics takes place at much larger rates which are instead comparable with the alfvn speed ( e.g. , dere 1996 ) . in a recently suggested model of turbulent reconnection , lazarian & vishniac ( 1999 , hereafter lv99 ; 2000 )",
    "have appealed to an inevitable wandering of magnetic field lines as the ultimate cause of fast reconnection . the scheme explains naturally flaring and other astrphysical phenomena , but numerical testing is still required .",
    "a competing model based on plasma properties ( bisckamp , schwarz & drake , 1997 ) to stabilize the petcheck reconnection layer has also been recently put forward .",
    "further research should determine the domains of each particular scheme s applicability .",
    "presently , let us focus our attention on regions of strong magnetic fields , like those around pulsars .",
    "in this case , fast reconnection ( with @xmath26 ) is ensured by anomalous resistivity ( see parker 1979 ) .",
    "following lv99 , we can estimate the width of the current sheet for which the resisitivity should be anomalous : @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the change of the magnetic field across the reconnection region , @xmath29 the particle number density , and @xmath30 the thermal velocity of the ions of charge @xmath31 . at the radius @xmath20 , where the magnetic field corrotates with the pulsar ( see fig .",
    "1a ) , the particle density has approximately the goldreich - julian value ( e.g. , goldreich & julian 1967 ) @xmath32 , which implies @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the thermal velocity in units of @xmath35 cm s@xmath1 , and @xmath36 s@xmath1 , with @xmath37 being the angular speed at the stellar surface .",
    "although this estimate is somewhat crude , the value of @xmath38 cm indicates that the conditions in the pulsar are more than appropriate to produce fast reconnection through anomalous resistivity over the entire region since @xmath39 ( see below ) .",
    "therefore , whatever processes are invoked to accelerate the particles , it is realistic to assume that the reconnection velocity that we deal with is an appreciable fraction of the local alfvn velocity . besides , as in the conditions we deal with this speed approaches @xmath40 , the expected acceleration rate can be very large",
    "any limitations on the efficiency at which acceleration may occur will then come solely from the way by which particles will manage to escape from the strong magnetic fields around the pulsar .",
    "a schematic representation of a reconnection region is shown in figure  1b .",
    "the upper and lower parts of the magnetic flux move towards each other with a velocity @xmath41 . as a result , charged particles in the upper part of the reconnection zone ``",
    "see '' the lower part of the magnetic flux to approach them with a velocity @xmath42 , and an acceleration process analogous to the first - order fermi acceleration of cosmic rays in magnetized shocks ( e.g. , longair 1992 ) may take place .",
    "in fact , it is straightforward to show that , during a round trip between the upper and lower magnetic fluxes , a particle will suffer an average increment of energy @xmath43 so that after a number of crossings the particles could in principle reach the required ultra - high energies .",
    "however , in the very strong magnetic fields present in the young pulsar , the particle energy losses due to synchrotron radiation can be rather substantial .",
    "let us evaluate them .",
    "a well known formula for the power radiated by a moving charged particle is ( e.g. , jackson 1981 ) @xmath44 \\label{power}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the proper time element .",
    "a usual assumption in the derivation of the synchrotron losses formulae is that @xmath46 , which means that the particle momentum , @xmath47 , changes rapidly in direction without relevant changes in e during a particle revolution around the magnetic field line . in this case , after simple algebra one can easily get @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the amount of energy lost by the particle of energy @xmath50 , when deflected by an angle @xmath51 in a magnetic field @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is the pitch angle between the magnetic field and the particle velocity .",
    "it is clear from eq.(4 ) , however , that for the regime that we are interested , i.e. , in the case of uhecr acceleration , the energy losses per revolution period may be very substantial . in this case",
    ", the classical synchrotron loss formulae should be modified . rewriting eq.(4 ) in the form @xmath54 and taking into account that @xmath55 is a lorentz invariant we get a quadratic equation for @xmath56 : @xmath57 where @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is the larmor frequency of the particle .",
    "the solution of this equation is @xmath60}{2d}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 . in the case of @xmath62",
    ", it reduces to @xmath63 which means that for @xmath62 , the energy loss per deflection @xmath51 will be @xmath64 , or @xmath65 which is independent of the magnetic field intensity . comparing eqs .",
    "( 10 ) and ( 5 ) , we see that the corrected synchrotron losses for uhe particles decreases by only an order of magnitude relative to the original evaluation .",
    "therefore , in the uhe particle regime , the synchrotron losses in strong magnetic fields are so large , even for very small deflection angles , that they exclude any possibility for particle acceleration via reflecting particles back and forth within the reconnection zone , as required in first ( or second ) order fermi acceleration processes .",
    "fermi acceleration would be possible for uhecrs only if the magnetic fields in the system were relatively weak . as indicated by eq .",
    "( 5 ) , for an @xmath66 particle , @xmath67 must be @xmath68 g in order to cause no relevant energy losses for finite particle deflection angles .",
    "since in the aic - pulsars , very strong magnetic fields are present and actually provide the energy reservoir for particle acceleration , we conclude that fermi processes are not suitable in this case .",
    "we show below instead , that direct acceleration by the induced electric field in the reconnection zone is the only viable mechanism .",
    "in paper i , we have argued that the protons could be accelerated by a large induced electric field within the reconnection region in the helmet streamer ( haswell et al .",
    "1992 , litvinenko 1996 ) , but now we find that an additional constraint should be applied to the magnetic field geometry , namely , that the accelerated uhecrs should escape without experiencing any significant deflection , otherwise their gained energy would be lost by synchrotron effects in the strong poloidal fields .    in the idealized two - dimensional field topology suggested in paper i ( see fig .",
    "1a ) , the reconnection site was a simple straight sheet along which the particles were accelerated by an electric field coming out of the plane shown in fig .",
    "1a , so that the particles could escape freely from the system on the normal direction to the plane of fig .",
    "1a . however , in a more realistic three - dimensional geometry , the reconnection region of fig .",
    "1a actually describes a cone around the rotation axis of the star , so that the accelerated particles escaping perpendicularly out of the plane of fig .",
    "1a will be eventually strongly deflected by poloidal field lines in their way out of the system , thus loosing most of their energy ( eqs .",
    "5 and 10 ) .",
    "on the other hand , it is well known from magnetized - winds theory ( e.g. , spruit 1996 ) that beyond the alfvn surface ( that is the surface at which the wind flow emerging from the disk / star system reaches the alfvn velocity , @xmath69 ) , the inertia of the gas causes it to lag behind the rotation of the field line , so that the poloidal lines ( @xmath70 ) get wound up thus developing a toroidal component ( @xmath71 ) ( see a schematic representation of the field line winding process in figure 2a ) . in the extreme relativistic limit ,",
    "the inertial forces in the flow are so high near the alfvn surface that they bend the poloidal lines into nearly horizontal shape , and the field becomes preferentially spiral , i.e. @xmath72 ( e.g. , camezind 1987 ) . in this case , as the accelerating electric field , which is perpendicular to the annihilating magnetic field lines , is mostly poloidal ( @xmath73 ) ( see figure 2b ) , the particles will be accelerated ( and allowed to escape ) along the poloidal direction without being deflected by the field lines , therefore , without suffering substantial synchrotron losses .    following paper i , we adopt shu et al .",

    "the inner disk edge @xmath20 rotates at an angular speed ( @xmath74 , and equilibrium between gravity and centrifugal force at @xmath20 will lead to co - rotation of the star with the inner disk edge , i.e. , @xmath75 , which for typical millisecond pulsars with rotation periods @xmath76 ms , mass @xmath771 m@xmath78 , and radius @xmath79 cm , gives @xmath80 cm @xmath81 , where @xmath82 cm . the magnetic field intensity in the @xmath20 region",
