    "the cross of different observational results at cosmological level indicates that besides the usual expected contents of the cosmic budget , like baryons and radiation , there is a dark sector , with two components , dark matter and dark energy . in principle , dark matter is present in local structures like galaxies and cluster of galaxies , suffering consequently the process of gravitational collapse . in this sense",
    ", dark matter behaves much as like ordinary matter .",
    "however , it does emit any kind of eletromagnetic radiation .",
    "dark energy , on the other hand , seems to remain a smooth , not clustered , component , driving the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "this property requires a negative pressure .",
    "many different models have been evoked to describe this dark sector of the energy content of the universe , going from the inclusion of exotic components in the context of general relativity theory to modifications of the gravitational theory itself , passing by other possibilities as the breakdown of the homogeneity condition . for a recent review ,",
    "see reference @xcite .    a very appealing proposal to describe the dark sector are the so - called unified models .",
    "the protype of such model is the chaplygin gas @xcite . in the unified model dark matter and dark energy",
    "are described by a single fluid , which behaves as ordinary matter in the past , and as a cosmological constant term in the future . in this sense , it interpolates the different periods of evolution of the universe , including the present stage of accelerated expansion .",
    "the chaplygin gas model leads to very good results when confronted with the obsevational data of supernova type ia @xcite . concerning the matter power spectrum data",
    ", the statistic analysis leads to results competitive with the @xmath2cdm model , but the unified ( called quartessence ) scenario must be imposed from the begining @xcite .",
    "this means that the only pressureless component admitted is the usual baryonic one , otherwise there is a conflict between the contraints obtained from the matter power spectrum and the supernova tests .",
    "many variations of the chaplygin gas model have been proposed in the literature .",
    "one of them is the modified chaplygin gas ( mcg ) model .",
    "the equation of state of the mcgm is @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are constants .",
    "when @xmath7 we recover the generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) model , and if in addition @xmath8 we have the original chaplygin gas model .",
    "the dynamics of the mcg model has been studied in the reference @xcite , while a dynamical system analysis has been made in reference @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the temperature function has been considered in reference @xcite .",
    "some background constraints were established in references @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the spherical collapse was made in reference @xcite , while a perturbative study , looking for some general features of the model , was carried out in reference @xcite . in all these studies",
    "the viability of the model was concluded , but no one of them has exploited the observational data concerning the perturbative behaviour of the model .    our intention here is to test the mcg model against the power spectrum observational data . for the background tests , as those analyzed in references @xcite , the mcg reveals to lead to competitive scenarios compared with the @xmath2cdm and the gcg models ( to give just some examples ) .",
    "however , the constraints coming from the power spectrum data are , in general , much more crucial since it tests not only the background framework , but also the perturbative behaviour of the model .",
    "many general constraints can be established on the parameters of the eos ( [ eos1 ] ) even not considering perturbations .",
    "for example , in the past the equation of state ( [ eos1 ] ) implies , when @xmath6 is positive ( a requirement necessary in a perturbative analysis in order to preserve a positive sound speed ) that @xmath9 in order not to spoil the usual primordial scenario of the standard model ( in special nucleosynthesis ) , @xmath4 must be smaller than @xmath10 , which may include negative values .",
    "on the other hand , as we will show below , the requirement that the sound speed of the mcg must be positive implies essentially that @xmath11 .",
    "hence , the admissible values of the parameter @xmath4 seems to be around @xmath12 .",
    "these considerations will be strengthened through the power spectrum analysis to be made later in this paper : the matter power spectrum data can be fitted only if @xmath13 . hence , essentially the only configuration possible is that corresponding to the generalized chaplygin gas , with perhaps some possible very small deviations from it . in this sense",
    ", we can consider that the mcg model is ruled out when confronted with the power spectrum observational data .",
    "in next set we set out the general equations of the mcg model at background and perturbative levels . in section",
    "iii we perform a numerical analysis comparing the theoretical results with the matter power spectrum observational data . in section iv we present our conclusions .",
    "our starting point are einstein s equations coupled to a pressureless fluid , radiation and to the mcg fluid .",
    "they read , @xmath14 the superscripts ( subscripts ) @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 stand for `` matter '' , `` radiation '' and `` chaplygin '' .",
    "we assume a perfect fluid structure for the cosmic medium as a whole and also for each of the components , @xmath18 using now the flat friedmann - robertson - walker metric ( as suggested by the seven - year wmap data @xcite ) , @xmath19\\ , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and identifying all the background @xmath20-velocities , einstein s equations reduce to @xmath21    in the above set of equations we have defined @xmath22    the perturbed equations in the synchronous coordinate condition can be established following closely the computation shown in reference @xcite .",

    "the matter content is given only by the baryonic component .",
    "if this quantity is left free , we find a prediction of a universe dominated only by matter , in contradiction to the supernova analysis @xcite .",
    "it must be remarked however that the conclusions obtained in the present work are restricted to a hydrodynamical representation of the dark energy component .",
    "if this component is alternatively represented by a self - interacting scalar field , leading to the same background relations , the restrictions arising from the positivity of the squared sound speed disappears .",
    "if the mcg model can survive the observational tests in this alternative formulation is a question we intend to address in a future work .",
    "the main difficult comes from the fact that the usual gcg gas is connected a kind of born - infeld , which leads to essentially the same expression for the sound speed as in the hydrodynamical formulation @xcite .",
