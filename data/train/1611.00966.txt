    "in the fields of audio signal processing and hearing research , continuous research efforts are dedicated to the development of optimal representations of sound signals , suited for particular applications . however ,",
    "each application and each of these two disciplines has specific requirements with respect to _ optimality _ of the transform .    for researchers in audio signal processing ,",
    "an optimal signal representation should allow to extract , process , and re - synthesize relevant information , and avoid any useless inflation of the data , while at the same time being easily interpretable .",
    "in addition , although not a formal requirement , but being motivated by the fact that most audio signals are targeted at humans , the representation should take human auditory perception into account .",
    "common tools used in signal processing are linear time - frequency analysis methods that are mostly implemented as filter banks .    for hearing scientists , an optimal signal representation should allow to extract the perceptually relevant information in order to better understand sound perception . in other terms , the representation should reflect the peripheral `` internal '' representation of sounds in the human auditory system .",
    "the tools used in hearing research are computational models of the auditory system .",
    "those models come in various flavors but their initial steps in the analysis process usually consist in several parallel bandpass filters followed by one or more nonlinear and signal - dependent processing stages . the first stage , implemented as a ( linear ) filter bank , aims to account for the spectro - temporal analysis performed in the cochlea .",
    "the subsequent nonlinear stages aim to account for the various nonlinearities that occur in the periphery ( e.g. cochlear compression ) and at more central processing stages of the nervous system ( e.g. neural adaptation ) .",
    "a popular auditory model , for instance , is the compressive gammachirp filter bank ( see sec .",
    "[ ssec : audfilters ] ) . in this model , a linear prototype filter is followed by a nonlinear and level - dependent compensation filter to account for cochlear compression . because auditory models are mostly intended as perceptual analysis tools , they do not feature a synthesis stage , i.e. they are not necessarily invertible .",
    "note that a few models do allow for an approximate reconstruction , though .",
    "it becomes clear that filter banks play a central role in hearing research and audio signal processing alike , although the requirements of the two disciplines differ .",
    "this divergence of the requirements , in particular the need for signal - dependent nonlinear processing in auditory models , may contrast with the needs of signal processing applications .",
    "but even within each of those fields , demands for the properties of transforms are diverse , as becoming evident by the many already existing methods .",
    "therefore , it can be expected that the perfect signal representation , i.e. one that would have all desired properties for arbitrary applications in one or even both fields , does not exist .",
    "this manuscript demonstrates how _ frame theory _ can be considered a particularly useful _ conceptual _ background for scientists in both hearing and audio processing , and presents some first motivating applications .",
    "frames provide the following general properties : _ perfect reconstruction _ , _ stability _ , _ redundancy _ , and a _ signal - independent , linear inversion procedure_. in particular , frame theory can be used to analyze any filter bank , thereby providing useful insight into its structure and properties . in practice , if a filter bank construction ( i.e. including both the analysis and synthesis filter banks ) satisfies the frame condition ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : erbfb ] ) , it benefits from all the frame properties mentioned above . why are those properties essential to researchers in audio signal processing and hearing science ?",
    "* perfect reconstruction property : * with the possible exception of frequencies outside the audible range , a non - adaptive analysis filter bank , i.e. one that is general , not signal - dependent , has no means of determining and extracting exactly the perceptually relevant information .",
    "for such an extraction , signal - dependent information would be crucial .",
    "therefore , the only way to ensure that a linear , signal - independent analysis stage , possibly followed by a nonlinear processing stage , captures all _ perceptually relevant signal components _ is to ensure that it does _ not lose any _ information at all .",
    "this , in fact , is _ equivalent to being perfectly invertible _ , i.e. having a perfect reconstruction property .",
    "thus , this property benefits the user even when reconstruction is not intended per - se .",
    "note that in general `` being perfectly invertible '' need not necessarily imply that a concrete inversion procedure is known . in the frame case , a constructive method exists , though .",
    "* stability : * for sound processing , stability is essential in the sense that , for the analysis stage , when two signals are similar ( i.e. , their difference is small ) , the difference between their corresponding analysis coefficients should also be small . for the synthesis stage , a signal reconstructed from slightly distorted coefficients should be relatively close to the original signal , that is the one reconstructed from undistorted coefficients . from an energy point of view , signals which are similar in energy should provide analysis coefficients whose energy is also similar .",
    "so the respective energies remain roughly proportional . in particular , considering a signal mixture , the combination of stability and linearity ensures that every signal component is represented and weighted according to its original energy .",
    "in other terms , individual signal components are represented proportional to their energy , which is very important for , e.g. , visualization . even in a perceptual analysis , where inaudible components should not be visualized equally to audible components having the same energy ,",
    "this stability property is important . to illustrate this ,",
    "recall that the nonlinear post - processing stages in auditory models are signal dependent .",
    "that is , also the inaudible information can be essential to properly characterize the nonlinearity .",
    "for instance , consider again the setup of the _ compressive gammachirp _",
    "model where an intermediate representation is obtained through the application of a linear analysis filter bank to the input signal .",
    "the result of this linear transform determines the shape of the subsequent nonlinear compensation filter .",
    "note that the _ whole _",
    "intermediate representation is used .",
    "consequently , the proper estimation of the nonlinearity crucially relies on the signal representation being accurate , i.e. _ all _ signal components being represented and appropriately weighted .",
    "this _ accurateness _ comes for free if the analysis filter bank forms a frame .",
    "* signal - independent , linear inversion : * a consistent ( i.e. signal - independent ) inversion procedure is of great benefit in signal processing applications .",
    "it implies that a single algorithm / implementation can perform all the necessary synthesis tasks . for nonlinear representations , finding a signal - independent procedure which provides",
    "a stable reconstruction is a highly nontrivial affair , if it is at all possible . with linear representations ,",
    "such a procedure is easier to determine and this can be seen as an advantage of the linearity .",
    "the linearity provided by the reconstruction algorithm also significantly simplifies separation tasks . in a linear representation , a separation in the coefficient ( time - frequency ) domain , i.e. before synthesis , is equivalent to a separation in the signal domain .",
    "such a property is highly relevant , for instance , to computational auditory scene analysis systems that , to some extent , are sound source separators ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : casa0 ] ) .",
    "* redundancy : * representations which are sampled at critical density are often unsuitable for visualization , since they lead to a low resolution , which may lead to many distinct signal components being integrated into a single coefficient of the transform .",
    "thus , the individual coefficients may contain information from a lot of different sources , which makes them hard to interpret .",
    "still , the whole set of coefficients captures all the desired signal information if ( and only if ) the transform is invertible .",
    "redundancy provides higher resolution and so components that are separated in time or in frequency can be separated in the transform domain .",
    "furthermore , redundant representations are smoother and therefore easier to read than their critically sampled counterparts .    moreover , redundant representations provide some resistance against noise and errors .",
    "this is in contrast to non - redundant systems , where distortions can not be compensated for .",
    "this is used for de - noising approaches . in particular , if a signal is synthesized in a straight - forward way from noisy ( redundant ) coefficients , the synthesis process has the tendency to reduce the energy of the noise , i.e. there is some noise cancellation .",
    "+ besides the above properties , which are direct consequences of the frame inequalities , the generality of frame theory enables the consideration of _ additional important properties_. in the setting of perceptually motivated audio signal analysis and processing , these include :    * perceptual relevance : * we have stressed that the only way to ensure that all perceptually relevant information is kept is to accurately capture all the information by using a stable and perfectly invertible system for analysis .",
    "however , in an auditory model or in perceptually motivated signal processing , perceptually irrelevant components should be discarded at some point .",
    "if only a linear signal processing framework is desired , this can be achieved by applying a perceptual weighting and a masking model , see sec .",
    "[ sec : psychotheory ] .",
    "if a nonlinear auditory model like the compressive gammachirp filter bank is used , recall that the nonlinear stage is mostly determined by the coefficients at the output of the linear stage .",
    "therefore , all information should be kept up to the nonlinear stage . in other words , discarding information already in the analysis stage might falsify the estimation of the nonlinear stage , thereby resulting in an incorrect perceptual analysis .",
    "we want to stress here the importance of being able to _ selectively _ discard unnecessary information , in contrast to information being _ involuntarily lost _ during the analysis and/or synthesis procedures .    * a flexible signal processing framework : * all stable and invertible filter banks form a frame and therefore benefit from the frame properties discussed above . in addition , using filter banks that are frames allows for flexibility .",
    "for instance , one can gradually tune the signal representation such as the _ time - frequency resolution _",
    ", analysis filters _ shape _ and _ bandwidth _ , _ frequency scale _",
    ", _ sampling density _ etc . , while at the same time retaining the crucial frame properties . it can be tremendously useful to provide a single and adaptable framework that allows to switch model parameters and/or transition between them . by staying in the common general setting of filter bank frames , the linear filter bank analysis in an auditory model or signal processing scheme",
    "can be seen as an exchangeable , practically self - contained block in the scheme .",
    "thus , the filter bank parameters , e.g. those mentioned before , can be tuned by scientists according to their preference , without the need to redesign the remainder of the model / scheme .",
    "such a common background leads to results being more comparable across research projects and thus benefits not only the individual researcher , but the whole field .",
    "two main advantages of a common background are the following : first , the properties and parameters of various models can be easily interpreted and compared across contributions ; second , by the adaption of a linear model to obtain a nonlinear model the new model parameters remain interpretable .",
    "* ease of integration : * filter banks are already a common tool in both hearing science and signal processing . integrating a filter bank frame into an existing analysis / processing framework",
    "will often only require minor modifications of existing approaches .",
    "thus , frames provide a theoretically sound foundation without the need to fundamentally re - design the remainder of your analysis ( or processing ) framework .",
    "+ _ in some cases , you might already implicitly use frames without knowing it . in that case , we provide here the conceptual background necessary to unlock the full potential of your method . _ + the rest of this chapter is organized as follows : in section [ sec : psychotheory ] , we provide basic information about the human auditory system and introduce some psychoacoustic concepts . in section [ sec : frameth ] we present the basics of frame theory providing the main definitions and a few crucial mathematical statements . in section [ sec : erbfb ]",
    "we provide some details on filter bank frames .",
    "the chapter concludes with section [ sec : appli ] where some examples are given for the application of frame theory to signal processing in psychoacoustics .",
    "this section provides a brief introduction to the human auditory system .",
    "important concepts that are relevant to the problems treated in this chapter are then introduced , namely auditory filtering and auditory masking . for a more complete description of the hearing organ ,",
    "the interested reader is referred to e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the human ear is a very sensitive and complex organ whose function is to transform pressure variations in the air into the percept of sound .",
    "to do so , sound waves must be converted into a form interpretable by the brain , specifically into neural action potentials .",
    "[ fig : earanatomy ] shows a simplified view of the ear s anatomy .",
    "incoming sound waves are guided by the pinna into the ear canal and cause the eardrum to vibrate .",
    "eardrum vibrations are then transmitted to the cochlea by three tiny bones that constitute the ossicular chain : the malleus , incus , and stapes .",
    "the ossicular chain acts as an impedance matcher .",
    "its function is to ensure efficient transmission of pressure variations in the air into pressure variations in the fluids present in the cochlea .",
    "the cochlea is the most important part of the auditory system because it is where pressure variations are converted into neural action potentials .",
    "the cochlea is a rolled - up tube filled with fluids and divided along its length by two membranes , the reissner s membrane and basilar membrane ( bm ) . a schematic view of the unrolled cochlea is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : earanatomy ] ( the reissner s membrane is not represented ) .",
    "it is the response of the bm to pressure variations transmitted through the ossicular chain that is of primary importance .",
    "because the mechanical properties of the bm vary across its lengths ( precisely , there is a gradation of stiffness from base to apex ) , bm stimulation results in a complex movement of the membrane . in case of a sinusoidal stimulation ,",
    "this movement is described as a traveling wave .",
    "the position of the peak in the pattern of vibration depends on the frequency of the stimulation .",
    "high - frequency sounds produce maximum displacement of the bm near the base with little movement on the rest of the membrane .",
    "low - frequency sounds rather produce a pattern of vibration which extends all the way along the bm but reaches a maximum before the apex .",
    "the frequency that gives the maximum response at a particular point on the bm is called the `` characteristic frequency '' ( cf ) of that point . in case of a broadband stimulation ( e.g. an impulsive sound like a click )",
    ", all points on the bm will oscillate .",
    "in short , the bm separates out the spectral components of a sound similar to a fourier analyzer .",
    "the last step of peripheral processing is the conversion of bm vibrations into neural action potentials .",
    "this is achieved by the inner hair cells that sit on top of the bm .",
    "there are about 3500  inner hair cells along the length of the cochlea ( @xmath035  mm in humans ) .",
    "the tip of each cell is covered with sensor hairs called stereocilia .",
    "the base of each cell directly connects to auditory nerve fibers .",
    "when the bm vibrates , the stereocilia are set in motion , which results in a bio - electrical process in the inner hair cells and , finally , in the initiation of action potentials in auditory nerve fibers .",
    "those action potentials are then coded in the auditory nerve and conveyed to the central system where they are further processed to end up in a sound percept . because the response of auditory nerve fibers is also frequency specific and the action potentials vary over time , the `` internal representation '' of a sound signal in the auditory nerve can be likened to a time - frequency representation .",
    "because of the frequency - to - place transformation ( also called tonotopic organization ) in the cochlea , and the transmission of time - dependent neural signals , the bm can be modeled in a first linear approximation as a bank of overlapping bandpass filters , named `` critical bands '' or `` auditory filters '' .",
    "the center frequencies and bandwidth of the auditory filters , respectively , approximate the cf and width of excitation on the bm .",
    "noteworthy , the width of excitation depends on level as well : patterns become wider and asymmetric as sound level increases ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "several auditory filter models have been proposed based on the results from psychoacoustics experiments on masking ( see e.g.  @xcite and sec .",
    "[ ssec : masking ] ) .",
    "a popular auditory filter model is the gammatone filter @xcite ( see fig  [ fig : gammatones ] ) .",
    "although gammatone filters do not capture the level dependency of the actual auditory filters , their ease of implementation made them popular in audio signal processing ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "more realistic auditory filter models are , for instance , the roex and gammachirp filters @xcite .",
    "other level - dependent and more complex auditory filter banks include for example the dual resonance non - linear filter bank @xcite or the dynamic compressive gammachirp filter bank @xcite .",
    "the two approaches in @xcite feature a linear filter bank followed by a signal - dependent nonlinear stage . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "this is a particular way of describing a nonlinear system by modifying a linear system .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that besides psychoacoustic - driven auditory models , mathematically founded models of the auditory periphery have been proposed .",
    "those include , for instance , the wavelet auditory model @xcite or the `` earwig '' time - frequency distribution @xcite .",
    "the bandwidth of the auditory filters has been determined based on psychoacoustic experiments .",
    "the estimation of bandwidth based on loudness perception experiments gave rise to the concept of bark bandwidth defined by  @xcite @xmath1    where @xmath2 denotes the frequency and @xmath3 denotes the bandwidth , both in  hz .",
    "another popular concept is the equivalent rectangular bandwidth ( erb ) , that is the bandwidth of a rectangular filter having the same peak output and energy as the auditory filter .",
    "the estimations of erbs are based on masking experiments .",
    "the erb is given by  @xcite @xmath4    @xmath5 and @xmath6 are commonly used in psychoacoustics and signal processing to approximate the auditory spectral resolution at low to moderate sound pressure levels ( i.e. 3070  db ) where the auditory filters shape remains symmetric and constant .",
    "see for example @xcite for the variation of @xmath6 with level .    based on the concepts of bark and erb bandwidths , corresponding frequency scales have been proposed to represent and analyze data on a scale related to perception .",
    "to describe the different mappings between the linear frequency domain and the nonlinear perceptual domain we introduce the function @xmath7 where @xmath8 is an auditory unit that depends on the scale .",
    "the bark scale is  @xcite @xmath9 and the erb scale is  @xcite @xmath10 both auditory scales are connected to the ear s anatomy .",
    "one aud unit indeed corresponds to a constant distance along the bm . 1",
    "@xmath11 corresponds to 1.3  mm @xcite while 1  @xmath12 corresponds to 0.9  mm @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of masking is highly related to the spectro - temporal resolution of the ear and has been the focus of many psychoacoustics studies over the last 70  years .",
    "auditory masking refers to the increase in the detection threshold of a sound signal ( referred to as the `` target '' ) due to the presence of another sound ( the `` masker '' ) .",
    "masking is quantified by measuring the detection thresholds of the target in presence and absence of the masker ; the difference in thresholds ( in  db ) thus corresponds to the _ amount of masking_. in the literature , masking has been extensively investigated in the spectral or temporal domain .",
    "the results were used to develop models of spectral or temporal masking that are currently implemented in audio applications like perceptual coding ( e.g. @xcite ) or sound processing ( e.g. @xcite . only a few studies investigated masking in the joint time - frequency domain .",
    "we present below some typical psychoacoustic results on spectral , temporal , and spectro - temporal masking . for more results and discussion on the origins of masking the interested reader",
    "is referred to e.g. @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we denote by @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 the frequency , duration , and level , respectively , of masker or target .",
    "those signal parameters are fixed by the experimenter , i.e. they are known .",
    "the frequency shift between masker and target is @xmath16 and the time shift @xmath17  is defined as the onset delay between masker and target .",
    "finally , @xmath18 denotes the amount of masking in  db .      to study spectral masking ,",
    "masker and target are presented simultaneously ( since usually @xmath19 , this is equivalent to saying that 0 @xmath20 ) and @xmath21  is varied .",
    "there are two ways to vary @xmath21 , either fix @xmath22 and vary @xmath23 or vice versa .",
    "similarly , one can fix @xmath24 and vary @xmath25 or vice versa . in short , various types of masking curves",
    "can be obtained depending on the signal parameters .",
    "a common spectral masking curve is a masking pattern that represents @xmath25 or @xmath18 as a function of @xmath22 or @xmath21@xmath26 ( see fig .",

    "measure the responses of the auditory filters centered at the individual @xmath22s .",
    "thus , masking patterns can be used as indicator of the _ spectral spread of masking _ of the masker or , in other terms , the spread of excitation of the masker on the bm .",
    "this spectral spread can in turn be used to derive a masking threshold , as used for example in audio codecs @xcite .",

[",
    "sec : appli ] ) .",
    "the term auditory scene analysis ( asa ) , introduced by bregman @xcite , refers to the perceptual organization of auditory events into auditory streams .",
    "it is assumed that this perceptual organization constitutes the basis for the remarkable ability of the auditory system to separate sound sources , especially in noisy environments .",
    "a demonstration of this ability is the so - called `` cocktail party effect '' , i.e. when one is able to concentrate on and follow a single speaker in a highly competing background ( e.g. many concurring speakers combined with cutlery and glass sounds ) .",
    "the term computational auditory scene analysis ( casa ) thus refers to the study of asa by computational means @xcite .",
    "the casa problem is closely related to the problem of source separation .",
    "generally speaking , casa systems can be considered as perceptually motivated sound source separators .",
    "the basic work flow of a casa system is to first compute an auditory - based time - frequency transform ( most systems use a gammatone filter bank , but any auditory representation that allows reconstruction can be used , see sec .",
    "[ sec : audlet0 ] ) .",
    "second , some acoustic features like periodicity , pitch , amplitude and frequency modulations are extracted so as to build the perceptive organization ( i.e. constitute the streams ) .",
    "then , stream separation is achieved using so - called `` time - frequency masks '' .",
    "these masks are directly applied to the perceptual representation ; they retain the `` target '' regions ( mask = 1 ) and suppress the background ( mask = 0 ) .",
    "those masks can be binary or real , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the target regions are then re - synthesized by applying the inverse transform to obtain the signal of interest .",
    "noteworthy , a perfect reconstruction transform is of importance here .",
    "furthermore , the linearity and stability of the transform allow a separation of the audio streams directly in the transform domain .",
    "most gammatone filter banks implemented in casa systems are only approximately invertible , though .",
    "this is due to the fact that such systems implement gammatone filters in the analysis stage and their time - reversed impulse responses in the synthesis stage .",
    "this setting implies that the frequency response of the gammatone filter bank has an all - pass characteristic and features no ripple ( equivalently in the frame context , that the system is tight , see  [ ssec : frametheory ] ) . in practice , however , gammatone filter banks usually consider only a limited range of frequencies ( typically in the interval 0.14  khz for speech processing ) and the frequency response features ripples if the filters density is not high enough .",

    "natural and important considerations served as a strong indicator that frame theory provides a solid foundation for the design of robust representations for perceptual signal analysis and processing .",
    "this connection was further reinforced by exposing the similarity between some concepts arising naturally in frame theory and signal processing , e.g. between frame multipliers and time - variant filters .",
    "finally , we have shown how frame theory can be used to analyze and implement invertible filter banks , in a quite general setting where previous synthesis methods might fail or be highly inefficient .",

    "[ sec : frameth ] and  [ sec : appli ] in this chapter are available for download on the companion webpage https://www.kfs.oeaw.ac.at/frames_for_psychoacoustics .",
    "it is likely that readers of this contribution who are researchers in psychoacoustics or audio signal processing have already used frames without being aware of the fact .",
    "we hope that such readers will , to some extent , grasp the basic principles of the rich mathematical background provided by frame theory and its importance to fundamental issues of signal analysis and processing . with that knowledge , we believe",
    ", they will be able to better understand the signal analysis tools they use and might even be able to design new techniques that further elevate their research .    on the other hand , researchers in applied mathematics or signal processing have been supplied with basic knowledge of some central psychoacoustics concepts .",
    "we hope that our short excursion piqued their interest and will serve as a starting point for applying their knowledge in the rich and various fields of psychoacoustics or perceptual signal processing .",
