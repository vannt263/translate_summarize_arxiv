    "<S> quantum memories are vital to the scalability of photonic quantum information processing ( pqip ) , since the storage of photons enables repeat - until - success strategies . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> the key element of all pqip architectures is the beam splitter , which allows to coherently couple optical modes . here </S>",
    "<S> we show how to combine these crucial functionalities by addressing a raman quantum memory with multiple control pulses . </S>",
    "<S> the result is a coherent optical storage device with an extremely large time - bandwidth product , that functions as an array of dynamically configurable beam splitters , and that can be read out with arbitrarily high efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> networks of such devices would allow fully scalable pqip , with applications in quantum computation , long - distance quantum communications and quantum metrology .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum information processing promises radical new technologies , such as provably secure communications @xcite , enhanced sensors @xcite , and super - fast computing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> photonics offers a powerful platform for quantum processing , with interactions between optical modes mediated by beam splitters . however , logical operations are conditioned on measurements @xcite , which means all pqip schemes are probabilistic , requiring optical quantum memories @xcite to synchronize elements . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate that addressing a raman quantum memory @xcite with a train of control pulses produces an interaction that is formally identical to a dynamically configurable network of beam splitters . </S>",
    "<S> recent results have established the coherence of this interaction for the case of photon - echo raman memories @xcite . in the present work </S>",
    "<S> , we use a broadband raman memory protocol @xcite with a time - bandwidth product  the ratio of storage time to pulse duration  in excess of 1000 . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> , multiple independent readout pulses can be used to trigger a train of read events . </S>",
    "<S> this allows to distribute photons over many temporal modes with controllable amplitudes , and , furthermore , to extract excitations stored in the memory with arbitrarily high efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of storage and programmable coherent coupling in a single device makes the raman memory a universal primitive component for pqip .    as an example , consider the task of _ photon subtraction _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which is a canonical non - gaussian operation in continuous - variables ( cv ) quantum information protocols @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> traditionally , one half of a two - mode squeezed state is directed through a highly transmissive beam splitter . </S>",
    "<S> when a photon is detected at the reflected port , the transmitted joint state is no longer gaussian , and is more entangled . </S>",
    "<S> however , the detection probability is small , so that many squeezed states must be prepared to achieve success . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if one half of a squeezed state is stored in a raman memory , a train of weak read pulses  corresponding to multiple beam splitters  allows to repeat the protocol until success ( that is , until the emission of a photon from the memory is detected ) . </S>",
    "<S> this application permits a doubly - exponential enhancement in the resource - efficiency of cv entanglement distillation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> storage in atomic ensembles allows strong light - matter coupling without the need for high - finesse cavities @xcite ; furthermore multiple spatio - temporal modes @xcite , or multi - photon ( _ i.e. _ cv ) states @xcite can be stored . </S>",
    "<S> it has recently been shown that off - resonant raman memories can also operate with quantum - limited noise in room - temperature vapours @xcite , since collisional fluorescence @xcite is eliminated . </S>",
    "<S> this off - resonant suppression of spontaneous emission makes the atom - light interaction _ unitary _ , so that via the bloch - messiah reduction @xcite it is formally isomorphic to a sum of independent beam splitter transformations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> essentially , raman memories behave like beam splitters because the ` failure mode ' is transmission : light that is not stored exits the memory unattenuated , since there is no resonant absorption . similarly a stored excitation </S>",
    "<S>  a spin wave  that is not retrieved simply remains in the memory , since no population is transferred to the excited state . </S>",
    "<S> our far off - resonant memory has a @xmath0ghz acceptance bandwidth , meaning that we are able to store , and subsequently address the memory with , many short optical pulses within the @xmath1s decoherence time of the memory . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show how to utilize this large time - bandwidth product ( @xmath2 ) to implement complex and configurable linear optical networks by temporal multiplexing with a train of readout control pulses ( as represented in parts ( a ) and ( c ) of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : memory_and_beam_splitters ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that a stored excitation can be completely retrieved , with efficiency arbitrarily close to unity , with such a train of pulses . </S>",
    "<S> finally we verify that coherence is preserved across temporal modes by interfering signals retrieved from two independent memories .    </S>",
    "<S> our quantum memory is based on raman absorption in a warm vapour cell ( 62  @xmath3c , 7  cm long ) containing cesium and 20  torr of ne buffer gas ( shown schematically in part ( a ) of fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the signal field to be stored ( pulse duration 300  ps ) is tuned away from the atomic resonance @xmath7 ( 6@xmath8 ) by a large detuning @xmath9  ghz but is coupled to the long - lived 9.2  ghz hyperfine - shifted storage state @xmath10 ( 6@xmath5 f=3 ) by a bright control pulse ( also 300  ps ) , which is tuned into two - photon resonance with the signal ( see part ( b ) of fig .  [ </S>",

    "<S> we model the effect of applying multiple readout pulses using a linearized , adiabatic theory of raman storage developed previously @xcite . given an initial input pulse with profile @xmath12 , the spatial distribution of excitations in the memory is given by the spin - wave amplitude @xmath13 a_\\mathrm{in}(\\tau)\\,{\\mathrm{d}}\\tau,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is an integral kernel involving a bessel function @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the argument @xmath15 is included to indicate the explicit dependence of @xmath14 on the temporal shape of the control pulse used to store the signal field . for readout , </S>",
    "<S> the retrieved signal field is given by a similar formula , @xmath16 b_\\mathrm{in}(z)\\,{\\mathrm{d}}z,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is similar to @xmath14 , and where @xmath18 now describes the time - dependence of the control field used to retrieve the stored spin - wave . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in @xcite , singular value decomposition of these kernels provides a set of optical and spin wave modes that are independently coupled by effective beam splitter interactions , where the reflectivity is set by the energy in the control . </S>",
    "<S> in general we have that @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a constant representing decay of the spin wave amplitude through decoherence over the storage time . </S>",
    "<S> note that in the case of multi - pulse retrieval , @xmath18 has the form of a train of pulses . </S>",
    "<S> we experimentally determine the temporal profiles @xmath21 , @xmath22 by taking square roots of the traces measured using a fast photodiode ( see below ) . </S>",

    "<S> the last retrieved pulse is too weak , so that it vanishes in the noise . </S>",
    "<S> the storage efficiency is 43% . </S>",
    "<S> the retrieval efficiency for each read event is 56.5% leading to total readout efficiency of 17% for the first read pulse , 7.5% for the second read pulse , 3% for the third read pulse and @xmath271% for the fourth pulse . </S>",
    "<S> the top panels show the analogous beam splitter networks . ]    to implement multi - pulse readout , we use a pockels cell ( quantum technology starfire 5dr ) to select a series of consecutive pulses ( energy @xmath2710  nj ) separated by @xmath28  ns from the 80  mhz pulse train of the laser ( newport tsunami ) . </S>",
    "<S> we store a weak signal pulse ( a coherent state containing around 1000 photons ) , frequency - shifted from the control by means of a 9.2  ghz electro - optic modulator ( newport  4851-m ) , and observe the transmitted and retrieved pulses on an amplified avalanche photo - diode with a ns response time ( thorlabs  apd210 ) . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : multiple_retrieval ] shows the successive retrieval of between 1 and 4 pulses ; the agreement with theory is excellent . </S>",
    "<S> the model predicts that each read pulse should extract roughly 57% of the stored spin wave , and this explains the observed efficiencies correctly , after accounting for decoherence of the spin wave by @xmath2730% ( @xmath29 ) over the 900  ns storage time , which is due mostly to the influence of stray magnetic fields @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the combined retrieval efficiency of four read pulses is 95% , which demonstrates how unit retrieval efficiency is rapidly approached with a multi - pulse read sequence . </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency of an ensemble memory is generally limited by the achievable resonant optical depth , whether or not the protocol operates on resonance @xcite , but here this number exceeds 1000 @xcite and is not a limiting factor , which is why unit efficiency can be reached .    </S>",
    "<S> in general , partial storage is useful as a means to entangle optical and material modes . </S>",
    "<S> also , non - deterministic storage can be heralded by post - selecting those events where no light is transmitted through the memory . by contrast , inefficient retrieval from the memory is always detrimental , since all protocols involving memories eventually require that stored excitations are read out . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the ability to completely retrieve the stored state , with arbitrarily high efficiency , using multi - pulse retrieval , is an important capability of the raman memory .    besides efficient retrieval , adjustment of the readout sequence enables control of the distribution of the retrieved signal over the readout modes . as discussed above , the theoretical model of the raman interaction has the form of a collection of independent beam splitter transformations with effective reflectivities determined by the control field @xcite . to further test the assertion that our memory can be described by this model , and to demonstrate the configurability of the beam splitter reflectivities </S>",
    "<S> , we varied the intensity distribution of the read control pulses by adjusting the pockels cell timing .    </S>",
    "<S> the close agreement between experiment and theory in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : multiple_retrieval2 ] confirms that the interaction can indeed be described as a beam splitter interaction between optical and material modes . </S>",
    "<S> these data also demonstrate the shaping of a stored signal pulse into multiple retrieved signals in different time bins @xcite , which approach offers a straightforward path to generating time - bin entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , storage of a single photon , followed by partial retrieval using three read pulses creates a time - bin entangled @xmath30-state @xcite , in which the retrieved signal photon is distributed over three temporally distinct modes .    . </S>",

    "<S> the storage efficiency is 40% . </S>",
    "<S> the retrieval efficiency for the balanced readout is 12.4% each , and the retrieval efficiency for the pyramidal readout is 5% for the first , 16% for the second and </S>",

    "<S> , we have demonstrated that a far off - resonant raman memory can serve both as a high bandwidth storage device and as a programmable and actively tuneable beam splitter array . </S>",
    "<S> we used a train of control pulses to distribute a stored excitation among multiple time bins with adjustable amplitudes ; we showed that near - perfect retrieval efficiency can be achieved with the use of just four read pulses , and we demonstrated that phase coherence is preserved across all time bins . </S>",
