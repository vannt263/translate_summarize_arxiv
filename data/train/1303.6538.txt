    "the interaction of a magnetic field with a charged particle with spin comes into the hamiltonian through coupling to the total ( orbital plus spin ) angular momentum . in crystals ,",
    "the total angular momentum is the sum of the bloch angular momentum , which contains atomic orbital and spin contributions , and the envelope orbital angular momentum.@xcite determining the coupling constant ( g factor ) is an important requirement to study the magnetic properties of materials . in bulk systems ,",
    "the value of the g factor is strongly influenced by band mixing , spin - orbit interaction and crystal anisotropy.@xcite    in the last years , there is increasing interest in controlling and exploiting the g factor of carriers confined in semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) for spin preparation , conservation and manipulation aiming at spintronic and quantum information devices.@xcite the magnetism of these structures is significantly different from that of bulk crystals because the weak magnetic confinement is supplemented by a strong spatial confinement .",
    "the latter has a profound effect on the energy structure , carrier - carrier interactions , band mixing and spin - orbit interactions,@xcite which , in turn , influence the g factor value . as a matter of fact , it has been shown that quantum confinement in qds leads to strongly anisotropic g factors for both electrons and holes,@xcite as well as to a quenching of the g factor value.@xcite up to date , most theoretical studies investigating the magnetic response of qds rely on effective mass and @xmath1 models .",
    "the standard inclusion of magnetic fields in @xmath1 hamiltonians consists in replacing the canonical momentum @xmath2 by the kinetic momentum @xmath3 , supplemented with the spin zeeman term , in the differential equation fulfilled by the envelope function ( here @xmath4 is the carrier charge and @xmath5 the potential vector defining the magnetic field).@xcite this approximation , hereafter referred to as the luttinger approximation , has been successful in explaining several experimental observations in heterostructures,@xcite it is implemented in the widely employed semiconductor software package _ nextnano_,@xcite and it is currently being used to determine the g factors of confined carriers.@xcite however , a number of situations have been identified where it provides qualitatively incorrect predictions .",
    "for example , in quantum rings under axial magnetic fields , the luttinger approximation predicts the optical gap to decrease with the field strength,@xcite contrary to magneto - photoluminesence observations.@xcite similarly , in vertically coupled qds , the luttinger approximation predicts that an axial magnetic field can tune the hole tunneling rate,@xcite but this effect is not observed in related experiments.@xcite the underlying reason is that the luttinger approximation includes off - diagonal magnetic terms in the hamiltonian , which artificially enhance the heavy hole - light hole ( hh - lh ) band mixing.@xcite    in ref .",
    ", an alternative formulation of the magnetic interaction was suggested , in which the replacement of the canonical momentum by the kinetic one is carried out prior to the envelope function approximation ( efa ) .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian has no off - diagonal magnetic terms directly coupling hh and lh , and the results become then consistent with the experimental measurements.@xcite    in the present work , we extend ref .",
    "theory in order to account for the spin zeeman term , and identify the coefficients that should accompany the magnetic terms in this approximation , which were pending clarification.@xcite the remote band influence is considered through the zero - field effective masses , which are known to provide a meaningful description even in strongly confined qds@xcite , and effective @xmath6-factors .",
    "we run calculations comparing this model with the luttinger approximation and show that the magnitude of the zeeman splitting we estimate is closer to experimental values for vertically coupled ingaas qds .",
    "thus , our theory offers improved accuracy in current attempts to understand and predict g factor values of holes in qds .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "s : theo ] , we derive the multiband k@xmath0p - efa hamiltonian for holes in the presence of a magnetic field . starting from a general formulation , the hamiltonian is then particularized to the case of qds with axial symmetry . in section",
    "[ s : res ] , we use the obtained hamiltonian to calculate the zeeman splitting of vertically coupled qd molecules .",
    "the results are compared with previous implementations of the magnetic field and experimental data .",
    "conclusions are given in section [ s : conc ] .",
    "the classical hamiltonian of a charged particle with anisotropic mass response to external forces , subject to the action of a magnetic field defined by a potential vector @xmath5 is : @xmath7 where @xmath4 is the charge and @xmath8 , @xmath9 the anisotropic mass .",
    "+ elemental particles , in addition to charge , have spin .",
    "we can introduce heuristically spin by making the formal replacement @xmath10 in the above equation and taking into account the next two identities involving vectorial operators :    @xmath11    in the above equations @xmath12 , @xmath13 are vector operators , the components of @xmath14 are the pauli matrices and @xmath15 represents the magnetic field .",
    "this formal replacement turns the kinetic energy @xmath16 into @xmath17 as it should appear in the dirac equation . if the mass is anisotropic we should write instead : @xmath18 where @xmath19 . + the @xmath20 term in ( [ eq4 ] )",
    "can be expanded as follows : @xmath21 + \\sigma_y \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m_x m_z } } [ \\pi_z,\\pi_x ] \\\\   & + \\sigma_z \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m_x m_y } } [ \\pi_x,\\pi_y ] \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath22= \\pi_i \\pi_j- \\pi_j \\pi_i$ ] .",

    "then , we should assume that ,    @xmath49      in solid state physics the wave function @xmath50 is expressed as a sum of products @xmath51 , where @xmath52 are the bloch band - edge and @xmath53 are the envelope functions.@xcite let us call @xmath54 to the hamiltonian , eq .",

    "then , left - multiplying by the different bloch functions @xmath57 and integrating over the unit cell .",
    "afterwards , the effect of remote bands is incorporated by replacing the actual mass by effective masses in the matrix elements of @xmath56 .",
    "+ in the presence of magnetic field @xmath56 must be supplemented by @xmath58 coming from @xmath55 and @xmath50 , through a similar procedure . since all terms in @xmath55 act as pure multiplicative operators on the envelope function components except for @xmath59",
    ", we have that,@xcite    @xmath60    axially symmetric systems have well defined z - component @xmath61 of the total angular momentum and , additionally , the components of the envelope function associated to the bloch function @xmath52 have also a well defined @xmath62 orbital angular momentum,@xcite so that @xmath63",
    ". then , we calculate the @xmath64 matrix element of @xmath58 as follows :    @xmath65    i.e. , @xmath66    next , we incorporate de effect of the remote bands like in electrons : the mass @xmath67 arising in the two first terms of @xmath58 is replaced by the effective mass parameter appearing in the corresponding matrix elements of @xmath56 , while the third term in @xmath58 becomes @xmath68 .",
