    "the advent of the new generation of x - ray telescopes yielded a burst of detections of highly ionised absorption fe features ( e.g.  and ) in low mass x - ray binaries harbouring both black holes ( bh ) and neutron stars ( ns ) ( brandt et al .",
    "2000 ; lee et al .",
    "2002 ; parmar et al .",
    "2002 ; jimenez - garate et al . 2003 ; boirin et al . 2003 ; 2004 ; 2005 ; ueda et al .",

    ", at first , it has been realised that such features seems to be detected only in dipping - high inclination - sources ( diaz - trigo et al .",
    "the same has also proven to be true in bh systems ( ponti et al . 2012 ) , therefore implying an equatorial geometry of these absorbers .",
    "more recently , high resolution observations of bh systems showed that these absorption features have significant outflow velocities , and therefore are thought to be the signature of equatorial winds .",
    "the estimated wind mass outflow rates are generally of the order or higher than the mass accretion rates ( lee et al .",
    "2002 ; ueda et al . 2004",
    "; neilsen et al . 2011 ; ponti et al . 2012 ) , suggesting that these winds are a fundamental ingredient in the accretion process .",
    "another key aspect is that they are observed primarily in the so - called soft states ( see belloni et al .",
    "2011 for a recent review on x - ray states ) , when the accretion flow can be , at least , partially described by an optically thick , geometrically thin disc ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) and the radio jet is quenched ( fender et al .",
    "consequently , these winds are not observed during hard states , characterised by a strong comptonisation component and stable radio emission from a compact jet .",
    "these observational facts suggest a deep link between the presence of an equatorial disc wind and the accretion disc state and/or the jet ( neilsen & lee 2009 ; ponti et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "ns systems are also known to display several x - ray states . in particular , when accreting at low to moderate rates ( @xmath2  l@xmath3 ) , these are in many aspects analogous to the hard and soft states observed in bh ( see van der klis 2006 ) .",
    "they are also observed to alternate following marked hysteresis patterns ( muoz - darias et al .",
    "2014 ) and to be similarly connected with the presence / absence of the ( radio ) jet ( migliari & fender 2006 ) .",
    "although the fe  k absorbers in ns show similar properties to bh systems ( e.g. fe  k lines equivalent widths , absorber ionisation states , equatorial geometries ; diaz - trigo & boirin 2013 ) , an outstanding question is whether the same state - wind connection applies for accreting neutron stars too . to test this ,",
    "high quality observations of a high inclination ns system showing both hard and soft states are needed .",
    "( = uy vol ) is a neutron star low mass x - ray binary discovered in outburst by exosat in 1985 ( parmar et al .",
    "it was active for 23 years , until it finally returned to quiescence in 2008 ( hynes & jones 2008 ) .",
    "the system showed both absorption dips and eclipses implying a high orbital inclination . assuming a primary mass of @xmath4  m@xmath5 ( see muoz - darias et al .",
    "2009 and ratti et al .",

    "the strongest are neutral and photo - ionised absorption features ( jimenez - garate et al .",
    "2003 ; diaz - trigo et al .",
    "2006 ; van peet et al .",
    "2009 ) , with their column densities increasing and ionisation parameters decreasing during dips .",
    "in addition , collisionally ionised absorbers and oxygen emission lines have also been detected ( van peet et al . 2009 ) .",
    "* _ xmm - newton : _ * we use archival  data starting from the observation data files ( odf ) . they were processed with the mpe development version 13.5.0 of the   science analysis system ( sas ) , applying the most recent calibrations . for each spectrum ,",
    "the response matrix and effective area has been computed with the tasks rmfgen and arfgen .",
    "because of the higher effective area in the fe  k band , we use only the data from the epic - pn camera . up to 14 - 02 - 2013 there are 21 observations , publicly available in the  archive ( tab . [ data ] ) , pointed at  and with epic - pn clean exposure longer than 2  ks .",
    "we summed the spectra and response matrices of the consecutive short ( 3 - 5  ks ) observations accumulated during revolution 212 to increase the signal - to - noise .",
    "several observations in imaging mode were affected by photon pile - up ( tab . [ data ] ) .",
    "whenever significant pile - up is detected , we use an annular extraction region centred on the source , with inner radius of @xmath7 and outer radius of @xmath8 ( see e.g. van peet et al .",
    "2009 ) , otherwise a circular region with @xmath9 radius is used .",
    "the background was selected from a region of similar size and shape and on the same detector chip as the source region .    in order to identify and remove type i bursts from the analysis we used a 3  s resolution hard x - ray light curve ( @xmath10 kev ) since",
    "this energy band is only marginally affected by dipping ( diaz - trigo et al .",
    "2006 ; van peet et al . 2009 ) . in the same way , but with 15  s time bins , we selected the eclipses starting and ending times .",
    "the thresholds applied are reported in tab .",
    "we then identified the periods of enhanced particle activity by calculating the full detector light curve ( once excluded the events within a 2.5  arcmin region from the target ) in the 12 - 15  kev band .",
    "intervals with count rate higher than the threshold ( varying according to the observing mode and source brightness ) specified in tab .",
    "[ data ] were consequently filtered out .",
    "finally , to separate dipping and persistent emission , we divide the @xmath11  kev light curve by the @xmath12  kev one , since absorption dips are revealed by sudden increases in the hardness ratio . following van peet et al .",
    "( 2009 ) we determined the average hardness ratio of the intervals clearly belonging to the persistent emission and selected as _ dipping _ the periods with hardness ratios 1.5 times larger than the persistent value . after applying the particle background cut and the removal of bursts and",
    "eclipses , we extracted , for each observation , a source and background spectrum for both the persistent and dipping periods ( see tab . [ data ] ) .    for the only observation in timing mode ( tab .",
    "[ data ] ) , the source photons were selected from a region within rawx = 22 and rawx = 54 and background photons within rawx = 1 and rawx = 17 .",
    "the calibration of the energy scale of the epic cameras in timing mode is difficult .",
    "uncertainties of the order of several @xmath13  ev can be observed ( see the  calibration technical note 0083 ; guainazzi et al .",
    "2012 ) . following the recommendation of the epic calibration team , we apply the x - ray loading correction ( not default in version 13.5.0 of the sas ) to obtain the best possible energy scale .",
    "we are aware that an uncalibrated energy scale produces spurious features at the energies of the mirror edges .",
    "however , the effective area above 2.5  kev , and in particular in the fe  k band , shows no strong edge .",
    "therefore , we focus our analysis on the 2.5 - 10  kev band only .    * _ chandra : _ * we reduced the data in a standard manner ( see ponti et al .",
    "2012 for details ) using version 4.4 of the ciao analysis package .",
    "we started from the _ evt1 _",

    "the red star corresponds to the only soft state  observation . to do this , we used measurements from simultaneous  data ( as in the case of the soft observation ) or we interpolated the closest in time . in the latter case",
    ", we also checked the 1 day -_all sky monitor _ light - curve to ensure that no flux increase ( i.e. suggesting a transition to the soft state ) occurred at that time .",

    "we show in red the source spectrum during the soft state observation ( tab .",
    "[ data ] ) , while the combined spectrum of all hard state observations is plotted in black .",
    "because we are mainly interested in the fe  k band and to avoid calibration related issues at the energies of the edges in the mirrors effective area , we solely fit the data over the 2.5 - 10  kev band .",
    "we started by using a power law ( powerlaw in xspec ) model absorbed by neutral material ( pha ) .",
    "this resulted in an unacceptable fit ( @xmath18 for 1496 dof ) , due to clear and intense absorption lines that are present at the energies of fe  xxiii - xxv and  transitions and at lower energies ( see fig .",
    "[ ldsofthard ] and [ ldrat ] ) .",
    "therefore , we added a gaussian line that significantly improved the fit ( @xmath19 for 3 new free parameters , f - test probability @xmath20 ) .",
    "the line energy is @xmath21  kev , with a width @xmath22  ev and an equivalent width @xmath23  ev .",
    "we note that the line energy is formally not consistent with the fe  xxv  k@xmath24 line transition ( @xmath25  kev ) , suggesting a contribution by a blend of the rarely observed fe  xxiii  k@xmath24 and fe  xxiv  k@xmath24 lines ) are : @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) ; @xmath28 ( 0.15 ) ; @xmath29 ( 0.47 ) and @xmath30  kev ( 0.11 ) ( bianchi et al . 2005 ) . ] .",
    "we then add a second gaussian line to fit the fe  xxvi  k@xmath24 transition ( we assume it has the same width as ) .",
    "the fit significantly improves ( @xmath31 for 2 new parameter , f - test probability of @xmath32 ) .",
    "the fe  xxiii - xxv and  lines energies are now @xmath21  kev and @xmath33  kev and their equivalent widths are @xmath34  ev and @xmath1  ev , respectively .",
    "the lines appear resolved and to have a width of @xmath35  ev .",
    "significant residuals are still present around @xmath36 , 3.1 and @xmath37  kev ( see fig .",
    "[ ldrat ] ) . therefore we add other four absorption lines ( with width equal to the fe  xxiii - xxv one ) .",
    "each of these lines is significant with associated f - test probabilities of @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the line energies are : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45  kev , thus they are consistent with being produced by s  xvi  k@xmath24 ; a blend of s  xvi  k@xmath46 and ar  xvii  k@xmath24 ; ca  xx  k@xmath24 and ca  xix  k@xmath24 .",
    "the line equivalent widths are : @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50  ev .",
    "this phenomenological model composed by a power - law continuum absorbed by neutral material plus six gaussian lines in absorption , produces an acceptable fit with @xmath51 for 1483 dof .",
    "however , we note that an excess of emission is still present in the fe  k band , possibly associated with either a not - modelled ionised fe  k edge or a broad fe  k emission line .",
    "the best fit power law spectral index is @xmath52 .",
    "the very steep spectral index suggests that an un - modelle d disc black body component ( as well as , possibly , the boundary layer ; e.g. lin et al .",
    "2007 ) might give a significant contribution at the lowest energies considered here .",
    "the 3 - 10 and 6 - 10  kev observed source fluxes are @xmath53 and @xmath54 erg @xmath55 s@xmath56 , respectively .",
    "the observation of satellite lines due to fe  xxiii - xxiv is quite unusual .",
    "alternative hypothesis are that either the line at @xmath57  kev is associated to the  transition , but produced by inflowing matter , or that the energy mismatch might reflect a calibration problem .",
    "we do observe the same energy of the line ( @xmath57 kev , but unresolved @xmath58  ev ) in the mos2 spectrum .",
    "however , both the epic cameras are in timing mode , thus they could be affected by the same calibration problems . to check",
    "if this might be the case , we observe that the ionised absorption component fitting the 2.5 - 10  kev band ( with @xmath59 @xmath55 and @xmath60 ; see  5 ) is expected to produce also low energy lines , such as o  viii at 653.6  ev . indeed",
    ", we do detect this line in the rgs spectrum .",
    "the line energy ( after fitting the continuum with a power law model in the narrow energy band between 0.6 and 0.7  kev ) is e@xmath61  ev and unresolved @xmath62  ev .",
    "no significant red - shift of the line is observed .",
    "if indeed the o  viii line is produced by the same material producing the fe  k lines , this suggests no inflow of the absorbing material with both a significant contribution from the  inter - combination line plus a blend of the fe  xxiii and fe  xxiv lines .",
    "finally , to check for any dependence of the ionised absorber with the orbital phase , flux level and - or strength of the dipping phenomenon , we divided the light curve both in 4 time intervals corresponding to different orbital phases , in 3 flux levels and in persistent and dipping intervals and fitted them separately .",
    "we do not observe any significant variation in the fe  xxiii - xxv and   lines ( when fitted with gaussian lines ) or in the ionisation parameters and/or column density of the photo - ionised absorber ( see  5 ) .",
    "the black data in fig . [ ldsofthard ] show the combined spectra of all the hard state  observations . each hard state spectrum",
    "is fitted separately by a power law model ( normalisation and spectral index are left free to vary , see tab . [ data ] ) absorbed by neutral material ( pha ) , but with the residuals combined for displaying purposes . as previously reported ( diaz - trigo et al .",
    "2006 ) , no strong fe  xxiii - xxv or  absorption line is observed in any of the hard state spectra both during the persistent or dipping periods .",
    "in fact , we add to the model two narrow ( @xmath63  ev ) gaussians to search for the presence of any  or  lines ( the energies of the gaussians have been fixed to 6.7 and 6.97  kev , the energies of the expected transition ) . from them , we only find upper limits as stringent as @xmath64  ev for both lines in each observation ( see tab . [ data ] and fig .",
    "_ can this difference be simply due to an ionisation effect ? _ the source persistent ( out of dips ) luminosity in the 0.5 - 1  kev band is about 5 - 10 times higher during the soft compared to the hard state observations .",
    "the luminosity at 7  kev is , instead , less than a factor of 2 higher .",
    "therefore , if exactly the same material ( creating the dips and the high ionisation absorption ) is along the line of sight during both states , ionisation effect must be at play having a significantly higher ionisation parameter during the soft state observation . inspecting the light curves , we note that the dipping phenomenon in the 0.5 - 5  kev energy band appears less intense during the soft state observation , in line with a possible reduction in the opacity induced by increased ionisation and thus lowering the effect of the dips in the soft x - ray light curve .",
    "to investigate the effect of the observed luminosity variation on the appearance of the fe  xxiii - xxv and  lines , a full characterisation of the various absorbing components , taking into account the broad band source spectral energy distribution , would be important .",
    "such a study is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , to have an order of magnitude estimate , we have performed a phenomenological fit of the soft state spectrum , substituting the six narrow lines with a photoionised absorption component ( modelled with the zxipcf component in xspec ; reeves et al . 2008 ; zxipcf*pha*powerlaw ) .",
    "this , indeed , provides a reasonable fit ( @xmath65 for 1494 dof ) , suggesting a common origin for these lines .",
    "we note that this crude model is able to reproduce most of the absorption structures ( it just leaves residuals at lower energies compared to the fe  xxiii line , possibly due to uncertainties in our knowledge of the oscillator strength for these rarely observed transitions ) and most of the curvature of the continuum .",
    "the best fit column density of the ionised layer ( assumed to be totally covering the x - ray source ) is @xmath59 @xmath55 , having an ionisation parameter @xmath60 .",
    "the column density of the neutral absorber is @xmath66 @xmath55 .",
    "given the narrow energy band used here , this value is not very reliable ( e.g. diaz - trigo et al .",
    "2006 found , fitting the entire energy band , @xmath67 @xmath55 ) .    using this best fit model as a baseline",
    ", we perform a simulation of a hard state spectrum .",
    "we reduced the ionisation parameter of the _ zxipcf _ component by @xmath68 in @xmath69 ( as a consequence of the lower luminosity at @xmath70  kev ) from @xmath71 to @xmath72 and simulated the spectrum and then fitted the fe  k absorption lines .",
    "we find that even at this lower ionisation parameter and luminosity , characteristic of the hard state , two intense fe  k absorption lines at @xmath73  kev and @xmath74 , with widths @xmath75  kev and @xmath58  ev and ew of @xmath76 and @xmath77  ev , should be observed .",
    "the presence of such lines in the hard state is excluded by our observations .",
    "this suggests that the presence of fe  xxiii - xxv and  absorption lines during the soft state is not _ simply _ due to ionisation effects but requires an additional mechanism .",
    "however this inference will remain tentative until these results will be tested via ad - hoc photo - ionised absorption models computed on the basis of the source spectral energy distribution .",
    "we have observed fe  k absorption in  during the soft state , while only upper limits are observed during the hard state observations .",
    "this behaviour resembles what is seen in bh systems ( ponti et al .",
    "a previous work by diaz - trigo et al . ( 2006 ) studied the fe  k absorption features in a sample of dipping - high inclination neutron star systems .",
    "the authors found that the strongest ( with @xmath78  ev , such as observed here for the first time in ) absorption lines in the spectra of these systems are  and .",
    "out of the seven sources in their sample , only  and 4u  1746 - 371 did not show any fe  k absorption lines .",
    "the authors suggests that the lack of  and   features in  might be due to a peculiar continuously - dipping phenomenon .",
    "we report here that during the hard state observations ( obsid : 402092010 and 0160760401 )  clearly shows periods of persistent emission with no evidence of dips , but still , no  and  features are observed .",
    "alternatively , the authors suggest that for  the highly ionised material is clumpy and located at the outer edge of the accretion disc , while being more distributed for the other sources .",
    "we investigated the dependence of the absorption with orbital phase , but we did not find any .    as  is a calibration source ,",
    "more than 20 observations have been gathered during the past decade .",
    "analysing this wealth of data , we discovered intense fe  xxiii - xxv and  absorption lines during the only observation in the soft state .",
    "we note that the soft state observation is characterised by higher soft and hard x - ray luminosities and a lowering of the intensity of dipping phenomenon in the 0.5 - 5 kev band . a correlation ( anti - correlation )",
    "is well known between the amplitude of the dips and the absorber column density ( the absorber ionisation parameter ) valid for dipping neutron stars ( boirin et al .",
    "2005 ; diaz - trigo et al .",
    "2006 ) . in particular ,",
    "the persistent emission shows the most ionised absorbing component .",
    "we observe the soft state luminosity ( @xmath79  kev ) to be higher than that of the hard state one ( even if by less than a factor of two ) , thus ionisation effects must be at play .",
    "however , they do not appear to be enough to explain the large variation in ionisation state required to generate the fe  xxiii - xxv and  absorption lines from the low ionisation material producing the dips .",
    "we note a remarkable similarity in the properties of high ionisation fe  k absorption in ns and bh systems .",
    "they both show fe  k lines with similar equivalent widths ( @xmath80  ev ) , primarily in high inclination - dipping sources ( diaz - trigo et al .",
    "2006 ; ponti et al .",
    "2012 ) , indicating a similar equatorial geometry .",
    "however , an important observational difference is related to the motion of the absorbers , generally observed to be outflowing in bh , while being at rest in several ns .",
    "unfortunately , the lack of high resolution grating data during the soft state of  does not allow us to reliably measure the outflow velocity of the fe  k absorption lines , and thus to prove if these features are signatures of a disc wind or not .",
    "we also note that recent studies of bh systems discovered a deep link between the presence of winds and the state of the accretion disc ( neilsen & lee 2009 ; ponti et al . 2012 ) , suggesting that these winds are a fundamental ingredient in the accretion process .",
    "the observation of intense fe  k absorption features during the soft states of  suggests that the state / wind connection ( wind / jet anti - correlation ) , valid for bh , does hold also in this source , and by extension in accreting ns in general ( ponti et al .",

    "<S> high resolution x - ray spectra of accreting stellar mass black holes reveal the presence of accretion disc winds , traced by high ionisation fe  k lines . </S>",

    "<S> neutron star systems also show equatorial high ionisation absorbers . however the presence of any correlation with the accretion state has not been previously tested . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied exo  0748 - 676 , a transient neutron star system , for which we can reliably determine the accretion state , in order to investigate the fe  k absorption / accretion state / jet connection . </S>",
    "<S> not one of twenty x - ray spectra obtained in the hard state revealed any significant fe  k absorption line . </S>",
    "<S> however , intense  and   ( as well as a rarely observed fe  xxiii line plus s  xvi ; a blend of s  xvi and ar  xvii ; ca  xx and ca  xix , possibly produced by the same high ionisation material ) absorption lines ( @xmath0 , @xmath1  ev ) are clearly detected during the only soft state observation . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the connection between fe  k absorption and states ( and anticorrelation between the presence of fe  k absorption and jets ) is also valid for  and therefore it is not a unique property of black hole systems but a more general characteristic of accreting sources .    </S>",
