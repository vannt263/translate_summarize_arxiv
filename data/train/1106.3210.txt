    "interacting fermi systems in one spatial dimension ( 1d ) provide the textbook example of departure from conventional fermi liquid theory . for reasons associated with the restricted phase space in 1d ,",
    "particle - hole pairs are indistinguishable from collective excitations .",
    "whilst in higher dimensional fermionic systems have low energy fermionic quasiparticles , in 1d we have bosonic particles  spin and charge density waves .",
    "the prototype model for interacting 1d fermions is the tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) model which involves linearising the single particle dispersion about the fermi points .",
    "this has the advantage of being exactly soluble via bosonisation @xcite and is a conformal field theory . retaining nonlinearity in the spectrum",
    "has recently shown to be possible and the spectral function for nonlinear luttinger ( nll ) liquids has recently been computed in perturbation theory @xcite .    in this paper we are going to explore the dynamics of fermions in a non - conformal field theory , @xmath1 super yang - mills with 16 supercharges in @xmath0 dimensions ( sym@xmath3 ) at finite density .",
    "we will extract the spectral function @xmath4 for this system in the planar limit @xmath5 by exploiting the fact that it admits a holographic dual @xcite for intermediate energy scales , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , in terms of the near - horizon geometry of a stack of @xmath8 parallel d1-branes in type iib supergravity .",
    "here we introduced the t hooft coupling @xmath9 whose engineering dimension is @xmath10 .",
    "as sym@xmath3 is a non - conformal theory , one anticipates that the spectral function will deviate significantly from the tl form . in",
    "the latter one encounters power law singularities with exponents set by the interaction strength .",
    "explicit breaking of scaling symmetry ought to soften this behaviour and indeed we find similarities with the nll predictions .",
    "what is however a lot more curious is the connection we uncover between this d1 system and the analysis of non - fermi liquids from holography undertaken in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) for 2d systems .",
    "these set - ups are now well understood in the semi - holographic framework @xcite . in these setups deviation from fermi liquid behaviour",
    "is attributed to local quantum criticality arising from the near - horizon ads@xmath3 region encountered in extremal black hole geometries .",
    "while the example we focus on also has a local quantum critical region , we shall in fact find that the effective holographic master field equations that govern the spectral function are identical despite the seemingly different microscopic nature of the field theories . to be precise",
    "we find that the spectral functions for fermionic operators in sym@xmath3 are identical to those obtained in the @xmath11 dimensional field theory of m2-branes .",
    "this is made possible by some remarkable coincidences in supergravity as we shall see in due course .",
    "sym@xmath3 for @xmath12 is described holographically in terms of the supergravity geometry obtained by taking the near - horizon limit of a stack of @xmath13 d1-branes . as we are interested in the dynamics of the theory in the grand canonical ensemble with non - zero temperature and charge density , we consider configurations where the d1-branes are non - extremal and spinning in the transverse @xmath14 .",
    "this turns on @xmath15-charges along the cartan @xmath16 and for simplicity we focus on the equally - spinning case when these are all equal .",
    "whilst the @xmath17 dimensional ( @xmath18d ) type iib solution for this background configuration is easily written down @xcite , it is convenient to work with a kk - reduced solution in 3d which is obtained by reducing type iib equations of motion on a @xmath19 with internal angular momentum @xcite .",
    "this lagrangian comprises of a dilaton @xmath20 , a gauge potential , @xmath21 and the metric , with the effective action @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "the spinning d1-brane is described as a charged , dilatonic black hole solution of . employing a prescient radial parametrisation given by the dilaton , @xmath24 , it is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 the horizon is located at @xmath27 and the black hole and dual field theory temperature",
    "is given by @xmath28 .",
    "alert readers will recognise the close similarity between this solution and the four - dimensional reissner - nordstrom ads solution , which will have an important role to play in the following .",
    "the field theory sym@xmath3 has fermionic operators @xmath29 residing in super - multiplets whose lowest component comprises of scalar chiral primaries , @xmath30 , transforming symmetric traceless representations of the @xmath31 r - symmetry group .",
    "we recall that the lagrangian for sym@xmath3 can be obtained by dimensionally reducing the 10d @xmath32 sym lagrangian on a @xmath33 and hence apart from the gluons it contains adjoint scalars @xmath34 which transform as vectors under @xmath31 .",
    "the dimensions of the operators @xmath29 can be computed by examining the two - point function in the vacuum . in the energy regime where the dual supergravity description is valid",
    "these take on integral values @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "equivalently , this spectrum can be described in terms of fermionic supergravity fields propagating in effective 3d d1-brane geometry by studying linearised kk fluctuations about the vacuum d1-brane solution .",
    "a comprehensive analysis of this reduction was carried out in @xcite and it was found that the masses are related to their conformal dimension via @xmath37 to compute the spectral function of @xmath29 using supergravity it suffices to consider a quadratic fermion effective action . for a fermionic mode @xmath38 with mass @xmath39 , we use @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the spin - connection , and @xmath43 .",
    "underlined indices refer to the local tangent space .",
    "note that this action is part of a larger interacting theory resulting from the reduction of iib supergravity , where the mass term appears with a dilatonic coupling as a consequence of this reduction . in the specific reduced iib action the masses @xmath39 and charges @xmath44 take on a discrete set of values . here",
    "we find it convenient to examine the behaviour for arbitrary @xmath39 and @xmath44 , leaving the special top - down cases for future investigation .",
    "given this set - up it is a straightforward to analyze the dirac equation resulting from in the background of the spinning d1-brane geometry .",
    "the fermionic correlators are obtained by a suitable modification of the prescription given in @xcite to account for the fact that we have a geometry that is not asymptotically ads .",
    "however , a simple trick allows us to reduce the computation to a previously solved problem and moreover provides a useful perspective . therefore we will now take a detour into the mysterious world of supergravity truncations",
    "it has long been known that the dilatonic branes geometries are conformal to ads @xcite .",
    "it is for instance clear that is asymptotically conformal to ads@xmath45 . what is more surprising is that this geometry has a hidden ads@xmath2 origin .",
    "for one , it can immediately be oxidised to a reissner - nordstrom black hole in ads@xmath2 using the ansatz ( the gauge field lifts trivially ) @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes lift direction .",
    "this metric , in turn , solves field equations of the einstein - maxwell system with negative cosmological constant , @xmath48 which is a well - known consistent truncation of 11d supergravity on @xmath19 .",
    "the action reduces to using the dilatonic ansatz and relating @xmath49 .",
    "connections between these two systems have been observed previously @xcite .",
    "here we go further and illuminate the origin of these connections as part of a more general story .",
    "the basic picture is presented in * fig . * [ sugradiagram ] .",
    "schematic hierarchy of supergravity truncations ]    starting with @xmath50d supergravity we may reduce on @xmath19 and perform a consistent truncation to the well known @xmath51 gauged @xmath31 supergravity @xcite .",
    "the massless modes one retains are the graviton transforming in the singlet of @xmath31 , gravitino in the @xmath52 , while the fermions transform as @xmath53 and the scalars fill out @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "likewise for type iia / b supergravity in @xmath18d where only a dilaton and 3-form field strength are retained , there remarkably is also a consistent truncation when reduced on @xmath19 @xcite to @xmath56 gauged @xmath31 supergravity in @xmath57d .",
    "the spectrum comprises of the graviton , a @xmath31 gauge field , 36 real scalars , transforming as @xmath54 and a singlet of @xmath31 , gravitinos transforming as @xmath52 and fermions in the @xmath53 .",
    "we have now at hand two different gauged supergravity theories with @xmath31 gauge group . for 4d solutions where no pseudo - scalars are sourced ( the @xmath55 ) ,",
    "the resulting effective bosonic theories are related through an @xmath58 reduction at the massless , nonlinear level . whilst this is not a consistent truncation ,",
    "it does allow us to relate a large class of solutions without pseudo - scalars , including the situation of current interest .",
    "given this observation it follows abstractly that the dirac equation arising from maps directly into the fermion wave equation on reissner - nordstrom ads@xmath2 background studied in @xcite .",
    "the map arises from simply kk - reducing on a spatial direction of this ads@xmath2 , which amounts to restricting to the zero - momentum sector in the @xmath47-direction . into a pair of independent equations for two - component spinors .",
    "one equation matches precisely that which arises from , whilst the other matches with @xmath59 . ]",
    "the spectral function we are after therefore is simply a slice of the spectral function for probe fermionic operators in the @xmath10d world - volume theory of m2-branes .",
    "fermion green s functions in theories with asymptotically ads dual geometries are readily obtained using standard holographic techniques @xcite . in appendix",
    "[ s : appendix ] we present the method adapted to the d1 geometry .",
    "density plot for the spectral function @xmath63 of a fermionic probe of sym@xmath3 with @xmath64 , @xmath60 at chemical potential @xmath65 and @xmath62 .",
    "the crosses indicate positions of normalisable , in - falling fermion modes at @xmath66 . ]    here , as a concrete example , we present numerical results for the case @xmath60 , @xmath64 at @xmath62 . the spectral function is presented in * fig . *",
    "[ plot : spec ] , exhibiting features indicative of a fermi surface .",
    "as expected these results match a @xmath67 slice of the m2 brane theory studied in @xcite .",
    "semi - analytic expressions for the @xmath62 correlators can be obtained for small frequencies , @xmath68 , using a matched asymptotic expansion @xcite . for the m2-brane geometry",
    "this relies on the fact that the geometry interpolates between a near horizon @xmath69 and an asymptotically @xmath70 geometry .",
    "these results may be dimensionally reduced to yield expressions for green s functions of the d1 system .",
    "indeed , the analogous matching calculation for the d1 system yields identical results , as its quantum critical behaviour in the ir is determined by an @xmath71 geometry consistent with the semi - holographic picture of @xcite .",
    "the location of each peak is determined by the existence of a normalisable , in - falling fermion mode at @xmath66 .",
    "these peaks are indicated by green crosses in the example of * fig . * [ plot : spec ] . in the vicinity of each such peak",
    "we obtain , @xmath72 where @xmath73 indicates the momentum of the peak in question , @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are real and can be determined numerically .",
    "@xmath78 is the retarded green s function computed in the near horizon @xmath71 : @xmath79 the momentum dependent factor @xmath80 can be found in @xcite and our result matches that of @xcite ( for the quantity @xmath81 with @xmath67 ) .",
    "the type of quasi - particle behaviour depends on @xmath82 and there is no stable quasi - particle associated with peaks satisfying @xmath83 @xcite . when @xmath84 , the magnitude of the ads@xmath3 contribution is subdominant to @xmath85 and in the vicinity of the pole at @xmath86 we obtain , @xmath87 we have retained the leading imaginary contribution in the denominator , @xmath88 , which gives a width to the peak away from @xmath89 and a finite quasi - particle relaxation time .    the green s function is the same as a slice of the m2 theory , in particular , the quasi - particle width is the same .",
    "in contrast , the restricted phase space in the tl model leads to zero - width quasi - particle excitations .",
    "however , the 1d nll models  which modify tl by an @xmath90 correction to the single - particle dispersion relation and density - density interaction  exhibit green s functions of the form near the pole , with width @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "the tl and nll models also displays non - trivial power - law behaviour in the real - part of the green s function , while resembles a free - fermion - like linear dispersion near @xmath92 .",
    "thus the nll models demonstrate that the differences between physics of fermi points and higher dimensional fermi surfaces need not be drastic , as indeed we find here .    of course , neither the tl nor the nll models approximate the d1 system .",
    "fermi point in the d1 system resemble the qualitative behaviour of relaxation via three particle scattering , the decay mode responsible for @xmath93 .",
    "] we simply wish to illustrate that it is possible to obtain a non - zero quasi - particle width by relaxing the approximation of a linear dispersion relation in 1d .",
    "this goes some way to resolving how the 1d and 2d systems of interest here may be connected microscopically .",
    "we studied a holographic model of a fermionic quantum liquid with a concrete dual qft : @xmath1 sym@xmath3 with 16 supercharges .",
    "thus our holographic results provide in - roads to a system which may be tackled in other ways , such as lattice field theory . in the interest of phenomenology we focused on generic probes of this system ; we leave supergravity specific probes for future study",
    ". it would also be interesting to study condensation of the adjoint scalars .",
    "where possible we confirm exact agreement between the direct holographic calculations in the d1 geometry and dimensional reduction of existing results with ads@xmath2 asymptotics .",
    "the spectral functions for sym@xmath3 indicate the existence of quasi - particle peaks indicative of a fermi surface , whose shape is controlled by the ir geometry and exhibit a range of behaviours depending on @xmath82 .",
    "the d1 spectral functions presented here differ from those of the tl model .",
    "the spectral support has a finite width about the quasi - particle peak ( see e.g. , * fig . * [ plot : spec ] ) indicative of nonlinear effects broadening the fermi peak and is further consistent with lack of conformal invariance of sym@xmath3 .    of course ,",
    "the tl model is idealised since the single particle spectrum is linearised about the fermi points .",
    "incorporating non - linearity in the dispersion enables the redistribution of quasi - particle momenta , leading to finite quasi - particle lifetimes @xcite . in the holographic model , rather than having explicit modification of the fermionic spectrum , we find that the effects of the charged black hole background provide a non - linearisation of the spectrum .",
    "a curious feature of our analysis is the connection we have drawn between the sym@xmath3 and the m2-brane theories . whether this is an artefact of supergravity or holds deeper significance remains to be better understood . for the current discussion",
    "we note that it is rather amusing to realise that the analysis of fermionic correllators in the m2-brane theories can be related to a model in 1d , reminiscent of old ideas attributing strange metal phase of high @xmath94 superconductors to luttinger liquid - like dynamics .",

    "bw is supported by a royal commission for the exhibition of 1851 research fellowship .",
    "while we have emphasised the connection between the 3d and 4d effective actions in the main text , retarded green s functions for @xmath29 may be obtained without invoking this using standard holographic techniques .",
    "we introduce @xmath95 and pick a plane wave basis , @xmath96 .",
    "we further define projections under @xmath97 as @xmath98 we supplement with the boundary term , @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the induced metric on the boundary .",
    "the variation of the total fermion action @xmath101 , when on - shell is a boundary integral by virtue of the equations of motion : @xmath102 counterterms are needed if @xmath103 , and for @xmath104 there is a logarithm in the boundary expansion . for convenience we will focus here on @xmath105 .",
