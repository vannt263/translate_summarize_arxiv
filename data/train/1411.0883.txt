    "* hereafter gl05 ) proposed a model for producing jet plasmons and particle acceleration by magnetic reconnection events in the surrounds of accretion disks around black holes with magnetospheres .",
    "this model predicts that the amount of magnetic power released by reconnection may be more than sufficient to explain observed flares from black hole mass sources in different scales ( from microquasars to llagns ) ( see de gouveia dal pino et al .",

    "their model invokes the interactions between the field lines anchored onto the black hole horizon and those onto the accretion disks around black holes .",
    "standard disk model @xcite was used in these works to describe the accretion flow around black holes taking into account near eddington regime . at high / soft or very high states of the x - ray emission @xcite",
    "the accretion is dominantly via a standard disk extending to the innermost stable circular orbit with a weak corona above the disk .",
    "however in the low / hard state , it is believed that the accretion flows are geometrically thick , optically thin advection - dominated ( adafs ) @xcite with an outer geometrically thin , optically thick disk .",
    "recently @xcite considered the cooling of the soft x - ray photons from the underlying accretion disk to the corona , and the bremsstrahlung , synchrotron , and corresponding self - compton cooling of the corona itself . with the decrease of the mass accretion rate ,",
    "the size of the inner disk decreases and eventually the disk vanishes completely by evaporation .",
    "consequently , the accretion becomes dominated by an adaf , in which the x - ray emission is produced by the comptonization of the synchrotron and bremsstrahlung photons of the adaf itself .    the recent simulation work by @xcite on transient jets in adaf regime during hard to soft state transition has shown that the magnetic reconnection of opposite polarity fields converts magnetic energy into kinetic and thermal energy fluxes .",
    "the transient jet power depends on the magnetic energy density and time scale over which it is dissipated , not on the black hole spin @xcite . besides",
    ", @xcite have suggested that the radio - quiet / loud dichotomy in agns could be due to the absence or presence of sufficient coherent magnetic fields . to include the dominant role of magnetic fields in the inner region around black holes , @xcite proposed that adaf could be replaced by a magnetically dominated advective flow ( mdaf ) .",
    "gl05 proposed a plausible model in which fast magnetic reconnection episodes in the corona above and below the inner region of accretion disks can explain the origin of radio flares observed in the galactic microquasar grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "this might happen whenever a large magnetic field arises from the inner accretion disk removing part of the angular momentum so that the accretion rate approaches the eddington rate and pushes the disk magnetic field lines towards the black hole magnetosphere .",
    "if both magnetic fluxes have opposite polarity then in the presence of anomalously high resistivity or turbulence an event of fast magnetic reconnection may take place releasing copious amounts of magnetic power that may accelerate particles to relativistic velocities in a first order fermi process ( gl05 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the model was further extended to other microquasars , agns and young stellar objects ( ysos ) ( gpk10 ) .",
    "recently the model was applied to a much larger sample of sources than before including llagns , blazars , microquasars and grbs ( kgs14 ) .",
    "they found evidence that the observed correlation between radio luminosities and the source masses , spanning @xmath0 orders of magnitude in mass and @xmath1 orders of magnitude in luminosity , in microquasars and llagns @xcite could be naturally explained by this fast magnetic reconnection model .",
    "moreover , they found that the observed gamma - ray emission in these sources could be also produced in the same core region .",
    "they also argued that the proposed mechanism could be associated with the transition from the low / hard to the high / soft states .",
    "we here revisit a similar scenario related to violent fast reconnection episodes between the field lines of the inner disk corona and those that are anchored in the black hole taking into account a sub - eddington flow .",
    "we study the same mechanism which comes into play for black hole sources spanning 10 orders of magnitude in mass , but instead of assuming as initial state that the accretion disk has already evolved to a shakura - sunyaev regime as in the previous works , we consider that the system is still in the end of the low / hard state and assume an mdaf disk .    in next section",
    ", we present the description of the physical picture regarding the interaction between disk and corona .",
    "we also present the disk parameters based on an mdaf disk model .",
    "subsequently , the rate of magnetic energy released by fast reconnection is derived . in [ sec : results ] and [ sec : conclusions ] , we discuss the results and draw our conclusions .    .",
    "the transitional flow between mdaf and adaf exists in the range @xmath2 ( adapted from @xcite ) .",
    "the lower panel depicts our magnetic reconnection scenario in the mdaf region in the surrounds of the black hole ( @xmath3 = @xmath4 ) .",
    "the magnetic field lines anchored into the black hole horizon ( not shown in the upper diagram ) encounter those rising from the disk , and fast magnetic reconnection may occur as described in the text.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=20.0% ] .",

    "the magnetic field lines anchored into the black hole horizon ( not shown in the upper diagram ) encounter those rising from the disk , and fast magnetic reconnection may occur as described in the text.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=30.0% ]",
    "following @xcite , in the disk region @xmath5 , the flow will be in a transitional state between adaf and mdaf ( figure 1 ) . in the region",
    "@xmath6 the flow will be in a truly magnetically - dominated ( mdaf ) state . inside @xmath7 , the plasma @xmath8 (= @xmath9 ) tends to decrease below unity , where @xmath10 is the gas pressure and @xmath11 is the magnetic field strength .",
    "the location @xmath7 is our interest for a fast magnetic reconnection event to happen due to the existence of turbulence in the neighbourhood where the transitional flow joins onto the mdaf region ( see below ) .",
    "the masses are scaled in solar units as , @xmath12    and accretion rates in eddington units , @xmath13    where @xmath14 .",
    "+ it is further assumed that , at some radius @xmath15 , the ion temperature , @xmath16 will saturate to a finite multiple of @xmath17 of the electron temperature , @xmath18 @xmath19 the value of @xmath17 can lie between 1 and 820 ( meier 2012 ) . in other words , an mdaf exists somewhere outside the isco and inside the two - temperature adaf .",
    "+ also , as shown in figure 1 , the location of the reconnection region @xmath20 where @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 with @xmath23 being the viscosity parameter . as in gl05 , gpk10 and kgs14 , the magnetic field in the inner region can be evaluated from momentum flux balance between the accretion flow and the magnetic pressure around the black hole . in an mdaf - like corona ,",
    "this condition implies magnetic fields in the z- and r- directions that depend on @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath17 , and @xmath23 , and are expressed as @xcite , @xmath26    @xmath27 the corresponding poloidal field strength is determined as , @xmath28 other mdaf coronal parameters such as density , ion temperature and height are respectively given by , @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31      let us assume that the magnetic field anchored into the bh is of the same order of the poloidal magnetic field in the corona above and below the disk in the inner edge of the disk ( gl05 ) . this is a reasonable assumption since the bh magnetosphere is built by the dragging of magnetic field lines from the accretion disk ( @xcite , gl05 ) .",
    "further , to allow reconnection let us assume that the new flux of lines that rise in the mdaf disk corona have opposite polarity to those deposited earlier in the bh magnetosphere ( which is possible if dynamo processes occur in the accretion disk ; gl05 , kgs14 and references therein ) . as mentioned , in order to extract as much magnetic power as possible to accelerate particles , magnetic reconnection has to be fast .",
    "the presence of anomalous resistivity @xcite or turbulence @xcite can speed up the reconnection rate to values near the alfvn velocity ( @xmath32 ) . as described in gl05 and kgs14 , the rate of magnetic energy that can be extracted from the magnetic contact discontinuity in the corona through reconnection is given by ( see rectangular zone in lower panel of figure 1 ) , @xmath33 here , @xmath34 .",
    "in the case of fast reconnection driven by turbulence @xcite we can derive the magnetic reconnection power in a similar way as explained in kgs14 .",
    "the presence of weak turbulence causes the wandering of the magnetic field lines and induces fast reconnection ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "assuming that the injection scale of the turbulence ( @xmath35 ) is of the order of the size of the reconnection zone ( @xmath36 ) , the reconnection rate is , @xmath37    @xmath38    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the alfvnic mach number of the turbulence , and @xmath41 the turbulence velocity at the injection scale .",
    "based on the expression of the turbulence velocity in the transitional layer between adaf and mdaf , we have @xcite @xmath42    substituting eqs . ( 4 ) , ( 6 - 9 ) and ( 11 - 13 ) into equation ( 10 ) , the magnetic reconnection power released by turbulent fast reconnection in the surrounds of the bh is given by ( gl05 ) , @xmath43    we note that @xmath44 , which has the same dependence on m as that for standard accretion disk model ( eq . 15 from kgs14 ) . the dependence with @xmath25 on the other hand ,",
    "is stronger in this case ( @xmath45 ; while in kgs14 it was obtained @xmath46 ) .",
    "as stressed in kgs14 , the magnetic reconnection power that is produced in an anomalous resistivity model does not cover most of the observed radio and gamma - ray emissions of the sources , so in what follows we consider the turbulent driven fast reconnection model only .",
    "besides , the mdaf scenario naturally drives turbulence in the corona , as remarked .",
    "figure 2 compares the calculated fast magnetic reconnection power driven by turbulence as derived in this work and @xmath47 ensure the nearly collisionality condition required by the mhd equations and the fast reconnection driven by turbulence ( see details in kgs14 ) . with this parametric space @xmath48 spans between @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and @xmath3 between @xmath51 and @xmath52 , ] where @xmath53 cm is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "( range of free parameters @xmath54 ; @xmath55 ; @xmath56 , @xmath57 ; @xmath58 ) with the calculated power in kgs14 employing the standard accretion model rather than mdaf .",
    "we find that , in spite of the inherent differences in the assumptions and parametrization ( the parametric space in kgs14 spans @xmath59 6@xmath60 ; @xmath61 ; @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) , both models produce very similar ranges of values for the magnetic reconnection power , therefore confirming the earlier prediction in gpk10 that the details of the accretion model should not affect much the results regarding the fast reconnection power extracted from the coronal regions around bhs .",
    "the models are also compared with the observed correlations between the core radio luminosity and the bh mass found for microquasars and llagns by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we see that the slope dependence of the magnetic power released by turbulent reconnection with the source mass is very similar to the observed radio luminosity - source mass correlations for these sources .             as in kgs14 ,",
    "in figure 3 we compare the calculated fast magnetic reconnection power driven by turbulence ( eq .",
    "14 ) with the observed nuclear radio and gamma - ray luminosities of a large sample ( of more than 270 sources ) including microquasars ( or galactic black hole binaries - gbhs ) , llagns , blazars , and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) ( see kgs14 and references therein for a detailed description of this sample ) .",
    "the radio emission is represented by diamond symbols , with red and green colours representing llagns and microquasars , respectively .",
    "the observed radio emissions of a few microquasars ( cyg x-1 and cyg x-3 ) and llagns ( cen a , ic 310 , per a and m87 ) which have been extensively studied in multi - wavelength campaigns are highlighted in the figure .",
    "the released fast magnetic reconnection power driven by turbulence , corresponding to fiducial parametric space , largely exceeds the observed radio luminosities .",
    "the figure indicates that only a small fraction of this power would be enough to explain the observed radio emission for most of the sources .",
    "as discussed in kgs14 , the accelerated relativistic electrons and protons are likely to cool via other mechanisms ( inverse compton , synchrotron self compton , proton - proton and proton - photon processes ) that may eventually lead to very high energy emissions .",
    "thus we have included in figure 3 also the observed gamma - ray luminosity , which is available for only 23 of the llagns and microquasars sources in the sample .",
    "this is represented by red and green circle symbols , respectively .",
    "these circles correspond to the emission of several seyfert galaxies ( most of which show only upper limits in the gev band ) , four radio galaxies and two microquasars ( cyg x-1 and cyg x-3 ) .",
    "the calculated magnetic energy power appears to be sufficient enough to produce also the gamma - ray emission , however what can be seen with certainty is that this emission follows the same trend as that of the radio emission and that both seem to be correlated .",
    "this may imply that both gamma - ray and radio emissions are likely to be produced in the same core region around the black hole and are powered by the same acceleration mechanism .",
    "figure 3 also depicts gamma - ray emission of blazars ( represented by blue circles ) .",
    "this sample contains 32 blazars studied @xcite . in spite of the doppler correction",
    ", the blazars emission does not appear to follow the same trend as that of llagns and microquasars .",
    "their radio emission ( not shown here , but in kgs14 ) does not follow the trend either .",
    "this is likely because the emission in blazars may originate from further out than the core region and may be produced by another population of relativistic particles probably at the shock along the inner jet .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the jet in blazars points towards the line of sight screening most of the inner core radiation .",
    "further , figure 3 also includes gamma - ray emission of 54 grbs @xcite which do not appear to follow any trend , similar to blazars .",
    "it can be suggested that the gamma - ray emission in case of both blazars and grbs can not be associated with the emission process resulting from fast magnetic reconnection events in the core region ; it is likely to be predominantly coming from the optically thin jet ( kgs14 ) .",
    "we have extended the earlier works by gl05 , gpk10 and kgs14 investigating the conditions for fast reconnection between the magnetic field lines that rise from the accretion disk and the lines anchored into the black hole ( bh ) horizon .",
    "distinctly from these previous works which adopted the standard thin , optically thick model of disk accretion , in this study we considered mdaf accretion in the inner region around the bh , which includes the dominant role of the magnetic field and is suitable for sub - eddington sources @xcite .",
    "this model produces results which are similar to those obtained in the earlier works .",
    "the calculated magnetic power released by fast reconnection driven by turbulence versus source mass is consistent with the observed correlation between radio emission and source mass for microquasars and llagns .",
    "this may be useful for interpretation of the fundamental plane of black hole activity which correlates the radio and x - ray emission of these sources with their black hole mass @xcite .",
    "the investigation of the x - ray emission , which is directly related with emission processes in the accretion disk , is out of the scope of this work which focussed on coronal emission .",
    "nevertheless , our model suggests a simple interpretation for the existence of these empirical correlations .",
    "as argued in gpk10 and kgs14 , since fast magnetic reconnection and the associated emission flares are strongly dissipative phenomena that lead to partial destruction of the equilibrium configuration in the inner accretion disk / corona region , this mechanism could be related to the transition from the hard or low / hard to the high / soft x - ray state ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the observed gamma - ray emission of these sources is also well correlated with the radio luminosity , and the calculated fast magnetic reconnection power is large enough to produce them both in the core region ( figure 3 ) .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned in kgs14 , the results here do indicate that the fast reconnection is relatively insensitive to the accretion disk model .",
    "the similarity between the results here produced with mdaf accretion and those of kgs14 with standard disk accretion is striking ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the only difference is that in order to magnetic reconnection to produce both emissions , the sources require in general accretion rates @xmath64 in the mdaf case and @xmath65 in the standard accretion case ( kgs14 ) .",
    "this difference is due to the inherent physical assumptions of each model as described .",
    "finally , our work further supports the observed correlation between grbs and blazars @xcite and suggests that the gamma - ray and radio emission from such sources can not be produced by fast magnetic reconnection in the core region .",
    "it is rather originated further out in the jet .",
    "to conclude , the results above mainly connect the radio and gamma - ray emission from low luminosity compact sources to magnetically dominated reconnection process in the nuclear region of these sources whether the accretion flow model is standard disk - corona ( kgs14 ) or mdaf ( this work ) . as further step ,",
    "more general analytical and numerical studies will be needed to explore the scenario here presented more realistically . also , the reproduction of observed non - thermal spectral energy distributions of different sources employing the acceleration mechanism above will help to further test it ( see attempts in this direction in * ? ? ? * ) .",
