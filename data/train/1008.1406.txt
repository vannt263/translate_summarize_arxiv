    "hoava - lifshitz gravity  @xcite is attracting much attention as one of candidates for the theory of quantum gravity because of its power - counting renormalizability , which is realized by the lifshitz scaling @xmath2 with the dynamical critical exponent @xmath3 in the ultraviolet ( uv ) .",
    "there are many attempts to investigate properties and implications of this theory  @xcite .",
    "it is natural to suppose that not only gravitational fields but also other fields exhibit the same lifshitz scaling in the uv .",
    "even if they classically have different scalings , quantum corrections should render them to have the same scaling .",
    "a lifshitz scalar with @xmath4 can obtain scale - invariant , super - horizon field fluctuations even without inflation  @xcite , thus can source the primordial curvature perturbations through mechanisms such as the curvaton scenario  @xcite or the modulated decay  @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that this value of @xmath5 is the minimal value for which gravity is power - counting renormalizable .    in order to discern this production mechanism of the primordial perturbation from others , we need to investigate distinct features in observables such as the cosmic microwave background . in this respect ,",
    "non - gaussianity has been considered as one of the promising approaches to distinguish production mechanisms .",
    "for this reason , there are on - going efforts to detect or constrain non - gaussian nature of the primordial perturbation  @xcite . towards identification of the production mechanism by future observations",
    ", theoretical analyses of non - gaussianity in various cosmological scenarios have been performed  @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on primordial non - gaussianity from a lifshitz scalar and calculate its bispectrum and trispectrum . with the dynamical critical exponent @xmath4 ,",
    "the scaling dimension of the lifshitz scalar is zero and , thus , nonlinear terms in the action are unsuppressed unless forbidden by symmetry or driven to small values by renormalization .",
    "it is those nonlinear terms that we expect to produce non - gaussianity .",
    "even when the lifshitz scalar s field fluctuations are linearly transformed to the curvature perturbations ( which can be realized by the curvaton mechanism or / and modulated decay ) , it turns out that the produced bispectrum can be large enough to be observed in future observations .",
    "we find three independent cubic terms dominant in the uv , each of which gives different shape dependence of the bispectrum .",
    "roughly speaking , they correspond to local , equilateral and orthogonal shapes , respectively .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : review ] we review generation of scale - invariant cosmological perturbations from a lifshitz scalar . in section [ sec :",

    "since @xmath27 is scale - invariant and there is only one scale @xmath30 in the uv quadratic action ( [ s2 ] ) , we expect that the power - spectrum should be roughly @xmath36    now let us calculate the power spectrum concretely . by solving the heisenberg equation obtained from the quadratic action ( [ s2 ] )",

    "can be realized naturally , while violation of the assumption is also possible in these scenarios . with the assumption",
    ", the curvature perturbation @xmath63 is related to the field fluctuation @xmath27 as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is an energy scale .",
    "therefore , the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation takes over the scale - invariance as @xmath66 the cobe normalization  @xcite sets @xmath67 , and thus @xmath68",
    "let us move on to discussions about non - gaussianity .",
    "in the previous section we have seen that a free lifshitz scalar with the dynamical critical exponent @xmath4 can produce scale - invariant perturbations .",
    "the essential reason for this is that the scaling dimension of the scalar is zero at high energy .",
    "this implies that at high energy , some nonlinear operators could be as important as leading operators in the quadratic action and that large non - gaussianity could be generated by those nonlinear operators . on the other hand , because of power - counting renormalizability , those nonlinear operators do not completely dominate over the quadratic terms and thus do not spoil the analysis of scaling dimensions and the scale - invariance of the power - spectrum unless the theory gets really strongly coupled . in this section",
    ", we shall present order estimates for the bispectrum of curvature perturbations and the corresponding nonlinear parameter @xmath6 , deferring detailed calculations until the next section .    as presented in ( [ phi - to - zeta ] ) , throughout this paper we assume that perturbations of the lifshitz scalar are almost linearly transformed to curvature perturbations . in our calculation of the bispectrum and trispectrum of curvature perturbations , we thus ignore nonlinear terms in the right hand side of ( [ phi - to - zeta ] ) and take into account the linear term only .",
    "in particular , @xmath69 this treatment is justified by the fact that perturbations of the lifshitz scalar have large non - gaussianity . actually , the bispectrum and trispectrum would obtain corrections from nonlinear terms in ( [ phi - to - zeta ] ) , but those corrections would be smaller than large contributions from the lifshitz scalar s intrinsic non - gaussianity . in terms of the nonlinear parameter @xmath6 ,",
    "corrections due to nonlinear terms in ( [ phi - to - zeta ] ) are typically @xmath70 but we shall see below that the scalar field s intrinsic non - gaussianity can lead to @xmath71 .",
    "we shall adopt the so called in - in formalism  @xcite to calculate the bispectrum and trispectrum of the lifshitz scalar . the leading contribution to the bispectrum",
    "is given by the following formula ( see the next section for details ) @xmath72 \\right\\rangle ,   \\label{in - in - bispectrum}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 represents cubic terms in the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "dominant terms in @xmath74 are marginal ones , i.e. those terms whose scaling dimensions are zero",
    ". actually , as shown in appendix  [ appendix ] , there are three ( and only three ) independent marginal cubic operators in the action in the uv : @xmath75 where @xmath76 are dimensionless parameters .",
    "( the fist term can be forbidden by the shift symmetry if one likes . ) evidently , validity of perturbative expansion ( in the in - in formalism ) requires @xmath76 be smaller than unity .",
    "the corresponding cubic operators in the interaction hamiltonian are @xmath77 each of these dominant cubic terms includes six spatial derivatives and gives zero scaling dimension to @xmath74 . combining this with the fact that the scaling dimension of @xmath27 is zero ,",
    "we conclude that the bispectrum of @xmath27 given by ( [ in - in - bispectrum ] ) should be scale - independent , and thus @xmath78 where @xmath79 stands for the most dominant one among @xmath76 ( @xmath80 ) .    roughly speaking , the non - linear parameter @xmath6 is defined so that @xmath81 thus , combining this with ( [ phiphi - to - zetazeta ] ) , ( [ phiphi - roughly ] ) and ( [ phiphiphi - roughly ] ) , we obtain @xmath82 here , we have used the cobe normalization ( [ cobenormalization ] ) . in the next section",
    ", we obtain a more precise expression for @xmath6 in terms of @xmath76 .",
    "as already stated , validity of perturbative expansion requires that the dimensionless parameters @xmath76 be smaller than unity .",
    "we find from the order estimate ( [ eq : estimation ] ) that @xmath6 can be large , e.g. as large as @xmath7 , even if @xmath76 are reasonably small .",
    "we have seen that the lifshitz scalar s non - gaussian intrinsic fluctuations can leave observable non - gaussianities in the sky . in this section ,",
    "we compute the bispectrum and trispectrum of lifshitz scalar fluctuations and discuss their shapes . since a lifshitz scalar with @xmath4 can have all possible self - coupling terms containing six spatial derivatives ( cf .",
    "( [ s3 ] ) , ( [ s4 ] ) ) , the resulting correlation functions can take various configurations in momentum space .",
    "we will see especially that the generated bispectrum includes local , equilateral , and orthogonal shapes .",
    "we also discuss non - gaussianity of the primordial curvature perturbations sourced by the lifshitz scalar s field fluctuations . by comparing with the latest observational constraints , we obtain bounds on the lifshitz scalar s self - coupling strengths .",
    "we make use of the prescription of the in - in formalism ( see e.g. @xcite ) for calculating expectation values of a product  @xmath83 of field operators at time  @xmath84 , @xmath85 q^i(t )   \\left [ t \\exp \\left(- i     \\int^t_{t_0 } h_i ( t')dt ' \\right )   \\right ] \\right\\rangle , \\label{inin}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 denotes time - ordering , @xmath87 is anti - time - ordering , @xmath88 is the product  @xmath83 in the interaction picture , and @xmath89 is the interaction part of the hamiltonian in the interaction picture .",
    "we take the time  @xmath90 to be at very early times when the fluctuation wavelengths are well inside the sound horizon . in the present case , introducing the time  @xmath91 , then the integral can be taken in terms of @xmath92 from @xmath93 to some time after the sound horizon exit . )",

    "] here , since ( [ local ] ) , ( [ orthog ] ) , and ( [ equil ] ) do _ not _ form a complete basis set , one should consider ( [ template ] ) as an indicator roughly telling which combination of the 3-point interaction terms in ( [ s3 ] ) gives which bispectrum shape .    using the above template function , one can estimate the non - gaussianity parameter  @xmath6 of the primordial curvature perturbations . as discussed around ( [ phiphi - to - zetazeta ] ) , we assume that the lifshitz scalar fluctuations are linearly converted to the curvature perturbations , i.e. @xmath127 with some mass scale  @xmath65 . for the bispectrum of bardeen s curvature perturbations  @xmath128 ( which is related to the primordial curvature perturbations by @xmath129 in the matter - dominated era ) @xmath130",

    "we can now use this relation to set constraints on the self - coupling strengths , by computing the necessary conditions for ( [ tildefnllocal ] ) , ( [ tildefnlorthog ] ) , and ( [ tildefnlequil ] ) to satisfy the wmap 7yr  @xcite constraints on the non - gaussianity parameters : @xmath137 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 ( each at 95% cl ) , respectively .",
    "thus we arrive at @xmath140 we expect that more rigorous treatments ( such as using observational data to constrain combinations of different shapes , instead of individual ones ) would not change the results significantly . ) are conservative bounds , since they are necessary conditions for satisfying observational constraints .",

    "since naively there is no reason for such self - couplings to be suppressed , we can expect large non - gaussianity to be produced from lifshitz scalar fluctuations , which may be detected by upcoming cmb observations . on the other hand , for the local - type bispectrum , observational constraints require @xmath105 to be as small as @xmath182 ( the level of tuning depends on @xmath105 s sign ) .",
    "however , as we have remarked , such self - couplings sourcing local - type non - gaussianity can be forbidden by a shift symmetry .",
    "the field fluctuations generated in the mechanism of @xcite obtain a scale - invariant spectrum .",
    "however , when one takes into account the renormalization - group flow of the parameters of the theory ( e.g. @xmath30 in ( [ s2 ] ) ) , the spectrum may become tilted .",
    "a time - dependent background value  @xmath183 may also give rise to similar effects .",
    "how strong the tilt becomes , as well as the scale - dependence of the non - gaussianity , remains to be understood . while in this paper we have studied fluctuations of scalar fields , the scalar graviton which can show up in hoava - lifshitz gravity may also obtain fluctuations in a similar manner .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate the possibility that such scalar graviton generates the primordial curvature perturbations .",
    "@xcite works in this direction .",
    "see @xcite for some issues related to the scalar graviton , including non - perturbative continuity of the limit in which general relativity is supposed to be recovered .",
    "see also @xcite for a recent attempt to eliminate the scalar graviton from the theory . ) furthermore , when considering cosmic inflation in hoava - lifshitz gravity , due to the field fluctuations freezing - out at the time of sound horizon  @xmath184 exit , the well - known relations in slow - roll inflation between various cosmological observables and the slow - roll parameters are expected to be modified .",

    "<S> a lifshitz scalar with the dynamical critical exponent @xmath0 obtains scale - invariant , super - horizon field fluctuations without the need of an inflationary era . </S>",
    "<S> since this mechanism is due to the special scaling of the lifshitz scalar and persists in the presence of unsuppressed self - couplings , the resulting fluctuation spectrum can deviate from a gaussian distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we study the non - gaussian nature of the lifshitz scalar s intrinsic field fluctuations , and show that primordial curvature perturbations sourced from such field fluctuations can have large non - gaussianity of order @xmath1 , which will be detected by upcoming cmb observations . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the bispectrum and trispectrum of the fluctuations , and discuss their configurations in momentum space . in particular , the bispectrum is found to take various shapes , including the local , equilateral , and orthogonal shapes . </S>",
