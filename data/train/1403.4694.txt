    "the various micromagnetic parameters of the sample are not exactly known : some of them are directly obtained from characterizations , but some others are more difficult to measure , so that one has to see whether or not , with reasonable values assumed for them , the experimental results can be reproduced . in the case at hand ,",

    "thus , with a lower value @xmath125  pj / m , a value @xmath126 would be required .",
    "this would however shift the value of the in - plane field where the two nucleation fields are equal , from 105 to 56  mt , whereas experimentally it is about 125  mt .",

    "<S> the decrease to zero of the nucleation field , seen both experimentally and in the model , is due to the decrease to zero of the ddw energy under a sufficiently large in - plane field . in the case of an in - plane field normal to the ddw , </S>",
