    "the second class characterizes weak ties among agents that are activated only occasionally .",
    "it is natural to assume that strong ties are the first to appear in the system , while weak ties are incrementally added to the egonet of each agent  .",
    "this intuition has been recently confirmed  @xcite in a large - scale dataset and indicates a particular egocentric network evolution . in order to quantify it",
    ", we measure the probability , @xmath7 , that the next communication event of an agent having @xmath8 social ties will occur via the establishment of a new @xmath9 link .",
    "we calculate these probabilities in the mpc dataset averaging them for users with the same degree @xmath0 at the end of the observation time .",

    "the empirical growth of the egonet can be captured by a simple mechanism .",
    "we find that the probability that a node , characterized by a social circle of size @xmath8 , will establish a new tie is well fitted by the expression : @xmath12 analogously , the probability of having an interaction with someone who is already in the egocentric network is @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 is an offset constant depending on the degree class considered . by fitting the function in eq.[eq : pn ] on the empirical data ( solid lines in fig.[fig3 ] inset ) we can determine the corresponding constant @xmath14 for each degree group ( see table 1 in the supplementary materials ( sm ) for the obtained values ) . using the measured @xmath14 values we can rescale the empirical @xmath10 functions as @xmath15 and",

    "different rules can be easily implemented to model different scenarios  @xcite .",

    "we extend the modelling framework introducing a simple reinforcement process in which nodes keep remembering who they have connected  @xcite .",
    "inspired by the observations in the mcp dataset , we impose a reinforcement mechanism in which an active node with @xmath8 previously established social ties will contact randomly a new node with probability @xmath40",
    ". otherwise , with probability @xmath41 it will interact with a node already contacted , thus reinforcing earlier established social ties . in this case",
    ", the selection is done randomly among the @xmath8 neighbours . this model ,",

    "we fix @xmath42 for all the nodes and we leave the generalization of the model where this value is correlated with node properties for future studies ( indeed we show in the sm how the emerging network properties are changing for different values of @xmath14 ) .    a side by side comparison of the time - aggregated representations of networks generated by the ml and rp models ( using the same parameters ) is shown in fig.[fig4]-a and b. the ml dynamics ( fig.[fig4].a ) induces an aggregated network with a degree distribution @xmath43 where @xmath44 and a weight distribution decaying exponentially  @xcite .",
    "this is also confirmed by large scale simulation results reported in fig.[fig1].d and e ( dashed lines ) . in case of the rp dynamics ( fig.[fig4].b ) ,",
    "the memory process induces a considerably different structure .",
    "these effects are quantified in fig.[fig1].d , e , and f ( solid lines ) .",
    "we observe a degree distribution that is heavy - tailed but more skewed in the rp model than the ml .",
    "this distribution is qualitatively matching the corresponding empirical measure in fig.[fig1].a .",
    "furthermore , the rp model generates heterogeneous weight distributions ( see fig.[fig1].e solid line ) capturing extremely well real data .",
    "this is not the case in the ml model where the absence of memory induces exponential weight distributions far from reality ( see fig.[fig1].e dashed line ) .",
    "the rp dynamics not only induces realistic heterogeneities in the network structure , but also controls the evolution of the macroscopic network components .",
    "indeed , due to the reinforcement mechanism , the largest connected component ( lcc ) in rp networks grows considerably slower than in the case of ml models ( for illustration see fig.[fig5].a ) .",
    "this is an important feature because dynamical process evolving on time - varying networks will progress with a time - scale that can not be smaller than the lcc growth time - scale . as consequence ,",
    "dynamical phenomena taking place on time - varying networks with memory will evolve at a slower rate than in memoryless time - varying networks . in the case of epidemic spreading for example , the memory in individuals connections patterns shifts the epidemic threshold to larger values , and more in general reduces the final number of infected nodes ( see sm for details ) .      in order to study the effects of the emergence of strong ties on dynamical processes taking place in the network",
    ", we consider the classic rumor spreading process  @xcite . in this scheme , each node can be in three possible states ; ignorant ( @xmath45 ) , spreader ( @xmath46 ) or stifler ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "we denote the densities of individuals in each state at time @xmath25 as @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 accordingly . at @xmath51",
    "everyone is ignorant except the selected single or multiple seeds who are set to be spreaders . at the time of an interaction",
    "the states of connected nodes can change by the following rules : ( a ) @xmath52 or ( b ) @xmath53 or ( c ) @xmath54 . here",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 are the transition rates into the states of spreader or stifler accordingly . in all measurement",
    "( if it is not noted otherwise ) we set @xmath57 and use @xmath56 as a parameter .",
    "we assume that only their ratio matters for the spreading behaviour ( supporting results are summarized in sm ) . using these rules",
    "the spreaders communicate with probability @xmath55 the rumor to connected agents that become spreaders on their turn . if the spreaders however find that a contacted agent is already aware of the rumours , with probability @xmath56 loose interest in the rumours and stop spreading it thus becoming a stifler . in the long run",
    "the system always reaches an equilibrium state where all spreaders have turned into stiflers , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "different parameters provide different penetration of the rumor in the network .",
    "interesting quantities to study are the velocity of spreading of the rumor and the total number of agents aware of the gossip at the end of the process ( stiflers ) .     nodes . in panel",
    "( b ) we show the stifler @xmath60 density in rumor spreading simulations in ml ( main panel , blue dashed line ) and rp ( main panel , purple solid line ) networks with @xmath61 nodes .",
    "we set @xmath38 and @xmath39 and run the simulations for @xmath62 time steps .",
    "the rumor spreading processes were simulated with the same parameters on aggregated ml ( inset , yellow dashed line ) and rp ( inset , brown solid line ) networks integrated for @xmath63 time steps.,scaledwidth=55.0% ]    here we are interested in studying the differences on the final contagion densities in networks with or without memory ( fig.[fig5].b main panel ) , all other parameters of the rumor spreading model being equal .",
    "we set @xmath38 and @xmath39 and in the case of ml networks at the end of the rumor spreading @xmath64 of the network is aware of the rumor . instead ,",
    "in the rp case the final contagion proportion is only slightly more than @xmath65 of the total nodes .",
    "this hampering of the contagion process is also shown in fig.[fig4].a and b for the same set of parameters .",
    "the differences are evident not only in the diffusion patterns , but also in the level of contagion . in rp networks , the rumor has spread only locally and reached @xmath6 nodes other than the seed , while during the same time in the ml networks the information reached @xmath66 nodes out of @xmath67 .    to investigate in more details rumor spreading processes on different activity - driven models , we perform further simulations using different initial conditions and varying the rumours model parameters . in particular , we initiate the spreading from ( i ) the most active seed , ( ii ) one randomly selected seed or ( iii ) ten random seeds",
    ". we then simulate each process for @xmath68 time steps , and measure the average final proportion of nodes aware of the rumor @xmath69 . in each case",
    ", we perform @xmath70 ( or @xmath71 for smaller systems ) simulations in identically parametrized ml and rp networks , where the process lasts at least @xmath70 steps . to highlight differences arising between the rumor propagation processes",
    "evolving on the two network dynamics , we kept @xmath57 and calculate the @xmath72 ratios as function of @xmath56 .",
    "results in fig.[fig6 ] indicate marginal size effects but strong dependence on the initial conditions .",
    "all corresponding ratios are decreasing with @xmath56 , highlighting increasing differences between the fraction of population reached by the rumor in the two network dynamics .",
    "the largest differences are observed for a single initial seed , especially in the case of the most active nodes .",
    "these numerical findings can be understood by considering that the rumor spreading and the reinforcement process are occurring on comparable time scales .",
    "the reinforcement mechanism induces recurrent interactions that enhance the cessation of rumor spreading by  pair annihilation \" of nodes connected by strong ties .",
    "this effect is controlled by @xmath56 and can induce up to @xmath73 relative difference in the population reached by the rumor in the case of the rp model .",
    "ratios of average stifler densities at equilibrium .",
    "the simulations for sizes @xmath74 and @xmath71 were run with various initial conditions ( see legend ) .",
    "the averages were calculated at @xmath68 considering only realizations that reached equilibrium after @xmath70 time steps.,scaledwidth=55.0% ]    in order to understand the biases induced in the dynamical properties of rumor spreading processes by the time aggregated representation of the networks , we consider topologies generated by a time - aggregated view of ml and rp models ( see fig.[fig5].b inset ) and compare the results with their time - varying counterparts ( see fig.[fig5].b main panel ) . the results obtained show striking differences between the velocity of spreading .",
    "indeed , the time for the rumor to reach a consistent fraction of nodes varies four orders of magnitudes in the two cases , with a very slow spreading dynamics in time - varying networks .",
    "interestingly , this behaviour is general to all spreading processes .",
    "the observed results indicate a clear difference between the dynamical properties of processes taking place on time aggregated or time resolved networks .",
    "our findings confirm that , when the time - scale of the processes is comparable with the evolution of the network , static representations of the system might introduce strong biases on the correct characterization of the phenomenon .      to verify the picture emerging from synthetic time - varying networks , we study the properties of rumor spreading processes in a real world time - varying system .",
    "in particular , we consider the mpc dataset and simulate the rumor spreading by using the actual sequence of calls ( for more details see methods ) @xcite . at the same time to directly contrast the role of memory and repeated interactions we defined a random null model defined by keeping the caller of each event as it appears in the mpc dataset , but selecting a callee randomly . in this way",
    ", we obtain a sequence recovering the original activities and shuffled egocentric networks .",
    "furthermore , inter - event correlations are removed .",
    "the corresponding simulation results in fig.[fig7].a shows a clear difference in the speed of spreading and final density of stifler nodes . while in the null model",
    "everyone becomes stifler at the end of the simulation , by using the original interaction sequences less than @xmath75 of the network is aware of the rumor .",
    "this effect is even more clear in fig.[fig7].b where their relative difference is rapidly increasing and becomes several orders of magnitude larger for larger @xmath56 values .",
    "different initial conditions are playing similar roles as we observed in synthetic networks .",
    "the effect of memory and repetitive interactions are the strongest if we initiate the rumor from the most active individual .",
    "we observed similar but weaker effects selecting a single or multiple random seeds .",
    "density in data - driven rumor spreading simulations run on top of the mpc dataset ( purple solid line ) and the mpc null model ( blue dashed line ) with @xmath76 . panel ( b ) depicts the @xmath77 ratios of average stifler densities at equilibrium .",
    "simulations of panels ( a ) and ( b ) were run with various initial conditions ( see legend ) and averaged over @xmath70 realizations . in panels ( c ) and ( d )",
    "we plot the surviving probability , @xmath78 , of rumor spreading processes initiated from a single random seed in the real mpc sequence and the mpc null model respectively .",
    "probability values of panels ( c ) and ( d ) were averaged over @xmath71 realizations.,scaledwidth=55.0% ]    we also measure the surviving probability @xmath78 defined as the probability that a rumor spreading process survives ( still contains nodes actively spreading the rumor ) up to time @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "we show @xmath78 for different @xmath56 in fig.[fig7].c .",
    "the initial scaling of @xmath78 shows that generally the rumor can spread only locally due to repeated interactions occurring on strong links between the seed and its neighbourhood .",
    "a very different behaviour emerges if we remove the effect of memory and repeated interactions considering the same quantities measured on the null model ( see fig.[fig7].d ) . here , as the initial effect of repeated interactions vanishes and all realizations survive until the rumor covers the whole network .",
    "note that similar results were obtained for activity - driven model processes presented in the sm .",
    "this highlights the significant role of recurrent interactions via strong ties .",
    "they play as bottleneck for the information propagation controlling the global outbreak of rumor spreading phenomena .",
    "we have presented the study of a large scale dataset of social interactions via mobile phone calls .",
    "we provided a simple empirical characterization of the effects of memory in its microscopic dynamical evolution .",
    "considering the empirical evidences , we defined a novel generative model for time - varying networks with memory .",
    "the model mirrors many of the structural properties observed in the real network , like degree and weight heterogeneities , and shows the spontaneous emergence of non - trivial connectivity patterns characterized by strong and weak ties .",
    "we characterize the effects of non - markovian and heterogeneous connectivity patterns on rumor spreading processes .",
    "interestingly , we find that strong ties are responsible for constraining the rumor diffusion within localized groups of individuals .",
    "this evidence points out that strong ties may have an active role in weakening the spreading of information by constraining the dynamical process in clumps of strongly connected social groups .",
    "the presented results underline the subtleties inherent to the analysis of dynamical processes in time - varying networks .",
    "no one - fits - all picture exists , and a classification of dynamical process behaviour calls for a thorough analysis of each particular processes and networks considered .",
    "furthermore , several extensions of the utilized framework of activity - driven networks are possible .",
    "examples are node - node correlations , heterogeneous dynamics , and bursty behaviour of nodes .",
    "the present study thus offers potential avenues for the study of dynamical processes in time - varying networks in complex settings where the memory of agents plays a determinant role in the evolution of the connectivity patterns of the system .",

    "the dataset was recorded by a single operator with @xmath84 market share in an undisclosed european country ( ethic statement was issued by the northeastern university institutional review board ) . to consider only true social interactions , and avoid commercial communications we used interactions between users who had at least one pair of mutual interactions",

    "repetitive interactions and memory play apparent roles in the early stage of the spreading processes as the rumour may die out shortly after its initiation and could spread only locally .",
