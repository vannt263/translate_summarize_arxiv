    "density functional theory ( dft ) can be implemented in a variety of ways , all of which have their roots in the pre - hohenberg - kohn era .",
    "a fully consistent implementation requires the formulation of density functionals for the kinetic energy as well as for the exchange and correlation energies , none of which can be expressed in terms of the one - particle density in a straightforward way .",
    "the kohn - sham formulation depends on the construction of a local one - body potential that incorporates the effect of interelectronic repulsion , giving rise to a ground state density that coincides with that derived from the solution of the exact many - body hamiltonian .",
    "finally , an approximate approach , based on the fact that the hartree - fock density is fairly close to the exact one , proposes that the exact ground state energy be evaluated by adding to the hartree - fock energy a correlation energy , calculated in terms of the hartree - fock density by means of an appropriate density functional .",
    "since the ultimate correlation - energy density functional , whose existence is guaranteed by the hohenberg - kohn theorem , remains elusive , the development and testing of ever improved density functionals keeps being vigorously pursued . for an extensive recent study see kurth , perdew and blaha @xcite . in this vein , chakravorty _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and jarzecki and davidson @xcite compared the exact and dft correlation energies across the helium ( and other ) atomic isoelectronic sequences . in the former article the exact correlation energy for the ground state of the helium isoelectronic sequence ( as well as for all other atomic isoelectronic sequences with up to 18 electrons )",
    "is compared with the values obtained using six density functionals ( i.e. , lyp @xcite , cs @xcite , vwn - spp @xcite , pz @xcite , b88 @xcite , lc @xcite  the acronyms will be explained below ) . of these ,",
    "only the lyp correlation energies are uniformly close to the exact values over the range of nuclear charges examined .",
    "b88 grows to become twice as large as the exact correlation energy , and all the others seem to diverge for large z. the latter article extends this study , considering p86 @xcite , lyp @xcite ( again ) , and pw91 @xcite as well as various combinations of these with exchange functionals .",
    "while , as noted above , the correlation energy obtained with the lyp functional ( evaluated for the hartree - fock density ) follows the exact correlation energy rather closely , this is not the case if the same functional is combined with becke s exchange functional . on the other hand ,",
    "the combination bp86 ( becke s exchange with the p86 correlation functional ) exhibits a rather close agreement with the exact correlation energies for the helium isoelectronic sequence .",
    "the overall conclusion of these authors is `` all dft functionals , [ ... ] reveal problems in descriptions of the energy as a function of nuclear charge '' @xcite .",
    "correlation energies were also evaluated by umrigar and gonze @xcite for several members of the helium isoelectronic sequence , in terms of both local and gga - type density functionals .",
    "the high @xmath0 limit of the helium ( and other ) isoelectronic sequences within dft was carefully examined by whittingham and burke @xcite , who pointed out that some correlation - energy functionals do not scale correctly to the high - density limit . in particular ,",
    "the local - density approximation diverges logarithmically at large @xmath0 , and the perdew - wang ( pw91 ) functional @xcite fails as well .",
    "they note that pbe @xcite was designed to correct for this failure .",
    "the over - estimate of atomic correlation energies by local density approximations based on the homogeneous electron gas has been analyzed by tong @xcite , who attributed it to the continuous excitation spectrum of the latter , infinitely extending , system , that allows for a `` soft '' response to the internuclear repulsion .",
    "a modification of the local density approximation , in which an energy gap is introduced , was recently studied by rey and savin @xcite .",
    "their results suggest that the inhomogeneity needs to be introduced more explicitly .",
    "an analysis of the properties that correlation - energy density functionals should satisfy in order to present a valid behavior along isoelectronic sequences was presented by staroverov _",
    "@xcite , who , as whittingham and burke @xcite , studied the high @xmath0 limit of some two - electron atomic ions .",
    "furthermore , an interesting methodological discussion of the construction of density functionals was recently presented by perdew _",
    "these authors make a strong case for nonempirical functionals and specifically recommend the pbe @xcite and the tpss @xcite functionals .",
    "hooke s atom consists of two `` electrons '' that repel one another like ordinary electrons but are bound to the `` nucleus '' via harmonic potentials .",
    "its separability , in center - of - mass and relative coordinates , was pointed out by kestner and sinanoglu @xcite , and the fact that for certain values of the force constant it is analytically solvable was noted by kais _",
    "_ @xcite and , more systematically , by taut @xcite .",
    "several studies for hooke s atom have been performed , aimed at deriving exact density functionals or kohn - sham type exchange - correlation potentials [ 23 - 25 ] , most notably by burke _",
    "[ 26 - 30 ] and ludena _ et al . _ @xcite .",
    "however , a systematic study over a broad range of force constants has not been presented , to the best of our knowledge , with the exception of the local - density calculations that were carried out by huang and umrigar @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we examine an assortment of correlation - energy density functionals proposed over the last seventy ( ! ) years .",
    "virtually each one of them had been tested for the helium atom , and most of them had been tested for a range of atomic ions isoelectronic with helium .",
    "needless to say , many of them have been applied , with varying degrees of success , to the study of heavier atoms as well as molecules , surfaces and solids , and share the credit for the immense impact of dft in all these areas .",
    "the hohenberg - kohn theorem implies that the ground - state correlation energy is a universal functional of the ground state density .",
    "the examination of the extent to which the commonly used correlation - energy density functionals satisfy this property is the principal aim of the present paper .",
    "this is carried out by considering the performance of the presently selected set of correlation energy density functionals for hooke s atom isoelectronic sequence .",
    "since these density functionals were originally developed for coulombic ( atomic and molecular ) systems , their performance for hooke s atom provides a severe test of their universal validity .",
    "moreover , hooke s atom remains bound over the whole range , @xmath1 , of the force constant .",
    "this fact allows correlation to be examined not only in the high @xmath2 ( weak correlation ) limit but also in the low @xmath2 ( strong correlation ) limit .",
    "the latter limit is not available for atomic systems , that become unbound below a certain critical nuclear charge .",
    "this property of hooke s atom isoelectronic sequence is elaborated upon below .",
    "another model system with similar properties is that of a two interacting particles confined to a spherical volume . here , the radius of the sphere provides a parameter that , upon variation , can be used to change the system from the low correlation to the strong correlation limit .",
    "this system was recently studied in detail by jung _",
    "@xcite who also compared the exact exchange and correlation energies with those obtained by some few approximate functionals .",
    "thus , the combined results of their and our study provide detailed insight into the accuracies of currently applied approximate density functionals and , consequently , may be used in improving those .",
    "ultimately , the physical reason behind the existence of correlation effects is the electron - electron interactions .",
    "thus , the total correlation energy can be written in terms of a double - integral over two position coordinates , involving the exact and the hartree - fock first and second order reduced density matrices , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a unique correlation - energy density in a six - dimensional @xmath5 space .",
    "on the other hand , in density functional theory it is common practice to write the correlation energy as @xmath6 the transformation from eq .",
    "( [ mcs01 ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ mcs02 ] ) is not unique .",
    "therefore , different approximate expressions for @xmath7 may look very different but nevertheless give very close total correlation energies @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "thus , since the approximate correlation - energy functionals most often are given in terms of approximate forms for @xmath7 , it is not possible to compare those directly and thereby obtain information on their performance .    instead , only the total correlation energy is of physical relevance .",
    "therefore , by considering the total correlation energy for continuous classes of systems detailed information on the performance of approximate density functionals can be obtained , that ultimately can be used in assessing their performance as well as in improving them .",
    "the helium isoelectronic sequence provides such a class of systems , as also is the case for hooke s atom sequence .",
    "however , as briefly pointed out above and as we shall demonstrate more carefully below , the former sequence is less general than what initially may be assumed , making it less informative for studies of approximate energy functionals . on the other hand , as we shall also demonstrate , hooke s atoms provide a class of systems for which the members are `` less similar '' than is the case for the helium sequence , making a detailed study of this sequence highly relevant .",
    "we finally add that correlation energy is defined differently in wave function methods and in density functional theory .",
    "since the numerical differences are not large and not will affect any of the conclusions of the present work , we shall not discuss this distinction further .",
    "the ground state of a spherically symmetric two particle system with the hamiltonian @xmath9 in which the ( local ) single - particle potential @xmath10 is sufficiently attractive , is a bound singlet ; hence , it satisfies @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the spin up and spin down densities , respectively ; i.e. , the spin polarization parameter @xmath14 vanishes .",
    "the spatial part of the corresponding hartree - fock wavefunction is of the form @xmath15 , and the electron density is given in the form @xmath16 it will be useful to note that @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , in the present context @xmath20 . for",
    "each of the density functionals considered below we provide the ( sometimes considerably simplified ) expression appropriate for the family of spherically symmetric two - particle systems presently studied .",
    "one reason for doing so is that the expressions for the various density functionals are scattered in the literature , in many instances the expression for a particular functional requiring consultation of several different sources whose notation is occasionally not fully consistent .",
    "the record is held by tpss , the specification of which requires consultation of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",

    "the dependence of the various functionals on the density is usually expressed via the wigner - seitz radius ( the radius of a sphere containing one particle with uniform density @xmath25 ) @xmath28    we follow the classification of @xmath23 $ ] into    * zero - order approximation ( 0oa ) , depending on @xmath25 only , * first - order approximation ( 1oa ) , depending on @xmath26 as well , * second - order approximation ( 2oa ) , depending also on @xmath27 .",
    "we note that this classification is closely related to the common classification into local density approximations ( ldas ) , generalized - gradient approximations ( ggas ) and meta - ggas .",
    "however , by restricting the classification according to the behavior for a spherical two - electron system , for a given functional we sometimes arrive at an expression that belongs to a lower class , in the classification specified above , than the general case .",
    "our classification here applies to this reduced expression .",
    "both as an additional check of the computations and to gain further insight into the behavior of the various density functionals considered , we examine the weak correlation limit ( @xmath29 or @xmath30 , for the helium and hooke s atom isoelectronic sequences , respectively ) of the corresponding correlation energies .",
    "this can be done by using the asymptotic densities @xmath31 and @xmath32 in fact , the density , correct to first order in the interelectronic repulsion , can be written for the helium isoelectronic sequence by replacing the nuclear charge @xmath0 by the screened nuclear charge @xmath33 .",
    "similarly , for hooke s atom the variational principle yields for the trial function @xmath34 the equation @xmath35 , where @xmath36 .",
    "the solution , to first order , can be written in the form @xmath37 .",
    "in fact , to study the weak correlation limit it is convenient to use the scaled radial coordinate @xmath38 or @xmath39 , for the helium and hooke s atom isoelectronic sequences , respectively . in terms of these coordinates @xmath40 becomes @xmath41 or @xmath42 , respectively . in terms of",
    "these scaled coordinates the expressions @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , that appear in several of the gga and meta - gga density functionals , obtain @xmath0- ( or @xmath2- ) independent forms in the weak correlation limit .",
    "the weak correlation limit for the various density functionals examined below should be compared with the exact values @xcite @xmath46 and @xmath47",
    "wigner s first exploration of the correlation energy density as a means for estimating correlation energies in many - electron systems dates back to 1934 @xcite .",

    "it follows that the he sequence does not provide a useful testing ground for exploring approximate density functionals , as long as it is not extended with further test systems .",
    "second , the electron density is more confined in space for the he sequence than for hooke s atoms . for the former",
    ", the cusp problem may be important since the region for @xmath179 is one of a large energy density although its volume is vanishing .",
    "a similar region does not exist for hooke s atoms , i.e. , for those systems the electron density is not maximized in a region of diverging potential .",
    "this suggests a further reason for using hooke s atoms as model systems for studying properties of electron densities in regions where the potential stays finite .",
    "this is exactly what is relevant when developing approximate density functionals aimed at describing the properties of chemical bonds .",

    "we did exclude a couple of recent functionals either because the correlation energies they provide for helium were judged to be poor , because no result was available to verify our implementation , or because they were considerably harder to implement . in the cases",
    "excluded we did not have a compelling reason to expect a particularly good performance for the helium sequence , let alone hooke s sequence .",
    "we may have excluded highly worth - while functionals by oversight or ignorance , for which we apologize .",
    "it has already been noted by several authors that most density functionals fail to yield an adequate dependence of the correlation energy on the nuclear charge , @xmath0 , along isoelectronic sequences .",
    "however , some , such as pbe , tpss , cs and lyp are not too bad .",
    "none of that is true for hooke s sequence , suggesting that the ultimate aim of developing a universal density functional has not yet been attained , not even for spherically - symmetric two - fermion systems . by analysing the electron densities for the two classes of systems",
    ", we found that the he sequence does not provide a sufficiently general class of systems for assessing or improving the quality of density functionals , whereas this is to a larger extent the case for hooke s atom isoelectronic sequence . a feasible approach",
    "to improving the universality of correlation energy density functionals could be to examine their reparametrization , allowing for a dependence on the one - body potential .",
    "since this potential is uniquely determined by the ground - state hartree - fock density , this approach is still consistent with the hohenberg - kohn framework of dft .",

    "<S> the correlation energies of the helium isoelectronic sequence and of hooke s atom isoelectronic sequence have been evaluated using an assortment of local , gradient and meta - gradient density functionals . </S>",
    "<S> the results are compared with the exact correlation energies , showing that while several of the more recent density functionals reproduce the exact correlation energies of the helium isoelectronic sequence rather closely , none is satisfactory for hooke s atom isoelectronic sequence . </S>",
    "<S> it is argued that the uniformly acceptable results for the helium sequence can be explained through simple scaling arguments that do not hold for hooke s atom sequence , so that the latter system provides a more sensitive testing ground for approximate density functionals . </S>",
    "<S> this state of affairs calls for further effort towards formulating correlation - energy density functionals that would be truly universal at least for spherically - symmetric two - fermion systems .    </S>",
