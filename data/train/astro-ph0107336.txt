    "the hamburg schmidt objective prism survey ( hqs ; hagen et al .",
    "1995 ) provides a magnitude - limited ( @xmath0 ) sample of low resolution spectra ( @xmath1  at @xmath2 ) of blue objects .",
    "although it was designed to pick up quasars , it has proven to be a resource for finding blue stars ( see e.g. heber , jordan & weidemann 1991 ) including new cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) .",
    "recent discoveries include the ux uma type hs0139 + 0559 ( heber , jordan & weidemann 1991 ) , the eclipsing systems hs1804 + 6753 ( ex dra ; billington et al .",
    "1996 ) and hs0907 + 1902 ( gnsicke et al . 2000 ) and the magnetic systems hs1023 + 3900 ( reimers , hagen & hopp 1999 ) and",
    "hs0922 + 1333 ( reimers & hagen 2000 ) .",
    "we have independently identified the 15.5 mag cv candidate kuv03580 + 0614 from the kiso schmidt camera survey ( wegner & boley 1993 ) as hs0357 + 0614 during the course of follow - up studies of hot star candidates from the hqs .",
    "our preliminary low resolution spectrum showed prominent heii @xmath3 4686 emission , as is also evident in the wegner & boley spectrum .",
    "this line is a characteristic signature of either a magnetic cv ( am her or intermediate polar type ) or an old nova ( the various types of cv systems and their characteristics are reviewed in warner 1995 ) . in order",
    "to determine the specific nature of kuv03580 + 0614 , we obtained photometric and time - resolved spectroscopic observations which provided the orbital period , the range of variability on short and long timescales and the location of the line emission regions .",
    "our identification spectrum of hs0357 + 0614 ( = kuv03580 + 0614 ) , obtained in october 1990 at the calar alto 3.5 m telescope with the focal reductor spectrograph with a resolution of about 7  ( figure 1 ) , is characterized by balmer and hei and heii emission as well as the c , n blend at 4650 .",
    "the heii line is similar in strength to h@xmath4 , indicating the presence of a radiation field rich in high - energy photons .",
    "the overall appearance is similar to the lower resolution spectrum in wegner & boley ( 1993 ) .",
    "twenty higher resolution spectra over 3.5 hrs were obtained at the apache point observatory ( apo ) with the 3.5 m telescope and double imaging spectrograph ( dis ) on the night of 2000 january 11 ut .",
    "the dis coverage is 4200 - 5050  in the blue and 5800 - 6800  in the red with @xmath52.5  resolution .",
    "a 1.5 arcsec slit was used with seeing conditions comparable to the slit width .",
    "the spectra were analyzed in a standard manner using iraf .",
    "the images were corrected with bias and flat fields , the spectra were extracted to one dimension with sky subtraction , the wavelengths were calibrated using helium , neon and argon lamps , and the fluxes were calibrated from standard stars in the kitt peak standards atlas . the combined mean blue and red spectra are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the flux differences between the calar alto and apo spectra are likely due to the intrinsic variability of the system as described in section 4 .",
    "differential photometry in a v filter was obtained on 3 nights at manastash ridge observatory ( mro ) in 1999 sept . and",
    "october using a tek ccd on the 0.76 m telescope .",
    "the bulk of our differential photometry of kuv03580 + 0614 was obtained in december 1999 and january 2000 at the braeside observatory ( bo ) in arizona , using a 0.4 m reflector equipped with a site512 ccd camera .",
    "@xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 magnitudes of kuv03580 + 0614 were derived relative to the comparison stars c , c1 , and c2 ( figure 2 ) , all of which are included in the guide star catalog and in the usno catalog .",
    "the last night was simultaneous with the apo spectra .",
    "the observations are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the @xmath7 light curves from mro ( figure 3 ) and the @xmath8 light curves from bo ( figure 4 ) show a modulation of @xmath9h , superimposed by flickering on time scales of @xmath10min .",
    "the quasi - simultaneous @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath11 light curves ( figure 5 ) show that the modulation is only marginally color - dependent . from figure 4",
    ", it is apparent that the amplitude of the modulation is quite variable , ranging from 0.2 mag ( dec .",
    "24 ) to 0.4 mag ( dec .",
    "the bottom plot ( jan . 11 ) shows that large changes are even possible from one orbit to the next .    to quantify this variation , we computed discrete fourier transforms ( dfts ) from various subsets of our photometry .",
    "these consistently revealed a strong signal at @xmath12 .",
    "figure 6 shows the power spectrum obtained from the combination of all our data .",
    "the strongest signal is again found near @xmath13 and shows a substructure of four possible periods .",
    "the uncertainty in cycle counts between our observation intervals prevents us from formally rejecting any of these possible periods .",
    "we folded all our photometric data with the four likely periods , and favor @xmath14=205.92min as it produces the smoothest orbital light curve , even though @xmath14=205.57min is slightly stronger in the power spectrum .",
    "a sine fit to all the data gave a period of @xmath15min , which is very close to our favored period .    in order to analyze the short - term fluctuations ,",
    "we fit a sine with a fixed period , @xmath16=205.92min , to the data of each individual night , and pre - whitened the data with the best - fit sine curves .",
    "we then recomputed the fourier transform on the detrended data .",
    "a number of periods are present in the range @xmath17 which have amplitudes consistent with the observed flickering .",
    "this intermittent presence of qpos in kuv03580 + 0614 is very similar to the short - term variability of the novalike variable ttari ( tremko et al .",
    "1996 ) . in ttari , which has been considered for a long time as an intermediate polar candidate , these qpos where interpreted either as the kepler period at the inner edge of a magnetically truncated disc or as the beat between the magnetospheric period and the white dwarf spin period ( e.g. hollander & van paradijs 1992 )",
    "throughout the 3.5 hrs of apo spectra , the emission lines are broad , with the balmer lines showing double and single peak components while the heii line remains single - peaked .",
    "some representative spectra are shown in figure 7 .",
    "we used centroid and gaussian fitting routines within iraf to measure the line velocities ( table 2 ) .",
    "these velocities were then fit to a sinusoid to determine the period , semi - amplitude , and gamma velocities .",
    "the best fit with the minimum standard deviation occurred for the heii line and the resulting period ( 204 min ) was consistent with that found from the longer photometric dataset ( above ) .",
    "we then fixed the period at 206 min ( as determined by the photometry ) and found the best values for k and @xmath18 by redoing the sine fits ( table 3 ) .",
    "the final fit and the data for heii is shown in figure 8 . after submitting our paper",
    ", we became aware of a preprint by thorstensen and taylor ( 2001 ) , which used h@xmath19 data to determine a slightly longer period of 215 min ( the cycle ambiguities in their data do not allow phasing together their 3 nights of observation nor any of their nights with ours ) . fixing the sinusoid period at 215 min with our data produced the same values as shown in table 3 ( with a shift of 0.04 phase ) .",
    "the period of 215 min is the second strongest peak in our power spectrum ( figure 6 ) . although they are not common , there are systems known ( e.g. tt ari ) that have shorter photometric periods",
    "  `` negative superhumps ''   than orbital periods ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "however , rather than speculating further , we await more extensive spectroscopic and photometric data to determine if the 4% difference is real and persistent and merely regard our phases as uncertain by 0.04 .    in order to provide more information as to the nature of the accretion in this system , we computed doppler tomograms ( horne 1991 ) . to construct these",
    ", we used a fourier - filtered back - projection program from keith horne that was modified for our computer and plotting needs by donald hoard .",
    "since there is no eclipse to mark the zero phasing , we used the red - blue crossing of the emission line velocity from the heii line which would correspond to inferior conjunction of the secondary if the emission lines originate from the white dwarf area . for our data",
    ", this phase 0 occurs at jd 2,451,554.650 .",
    "the resulting tomograms for h@xmath19 , h@xmath4 and heii are shown in figure 9 .",
    "each tomogram shows a completely different structure .",
    "the heii shows a spot at a location close to the white dwarf ( the small offset from v@xmath20=0 is within the accuracy of our phase determination ) .",
    "the h@xmath19 line shows a concentration at 0 velocity with an outer ring , while the h@xmath4 emission shows a half ring , with a lack of emission from phases 0.6 - 0.9 .",
    "the h@xmath19 also shows less emission at these phases .    since the simultaneous photometry from bo on this night ( bottom plot in figure 4 ) shows a large change in amplitude of the orbital modulation from the beginning to the end of the apo spectra , it is possible that the changing line intensities from variable mass transfer are causing some of the peculiarities in the tomograms .",
    "one of the basic assumptions of tomography is that the emitting regions are equally visible at all orbital phases so transient emission alters the correct picture . however , since the red and blue spectra are obtained simultaneously , this does not explain the large differences between the lines .",
    "the apo spectra start at phase 0.42 and end at 1.44 and the increased flux evident in the photometry and spectra begins about phase 1.2 so phases 0.6 - 0.9 are in the low fluxes ( and evident as low equivalent widths in the balmer lines during these phases ) .",
    "however , phases 0.4 - 0.6 ( where the equivalent widths are large and there is strong emission in the tomogram ( near v@xmath20=0 , v@xmath21=-300 ) is also in this low flux interval .",
    "it will require further data obtained with less change within an orbit to sort out the stable configuration in this system .",
    "we can conclude that the high excitation line emission originates close to the white dwarf while the balmer emission is partly from a disk structure .    from the simultaneous photometry / spectra on jan .",
    "11 , we can determine the orbital modulation peaks at phase @xmath50.75 .",
    "this phase is near that where a hot spot , created by the interaction of the mass transfer stream with the disk , would typically be best viewed .",
    "if this area is optically thick , it may be a strong continuum source , but may not be a source of line emission .",
    "while the orbital period of kuv03580 + 0614 seems clearly determined to be near 3.4 hrs , the exact nature of this novalike system is ambiguous . the bulk of cvs that occupy periods between 3 - 4 hrs consist of both the high mass transfer novalike sw sex stars and the magnetic ips . in general ,",
    "the distinguishing traits of the sw sex stars are strong heii , single - peaked emission lines and absorption appearing in the balmer lines at some phases ( usually near 0.5 ) .",
    "they are generally low x - ray emitters .",
    "the ips usually show a consistent spin - pulse and large hard x - ray flux , although some have qpos and others have low x - ray flux .",
    "they can also have strong heii .",
    "kuv03580 + 0614 has not been detected in the rosat all sky survey , so it is likely a faint x - ray source .",
    "the presence of a photometric modulation that may be 4% shorter than the orbital period , the sporadic prescence of a flickering timescale near 20 min and large variability in the structure of the balmer lines throughout the orbit make this system very similar to a handful objects in the 3 - 4 hr period range with unique properties such as ah men ( buckley et al .",
    "1993 ) , v795 her ( patterson & skillman 1994 ) , ls peg ( szkody et al .",
    "1997 ) and tt ari ( kraicheva et al . 1999 ) .",
    "whatever the affiliation of kuv03580 + 0614 , its presence in the 34hrs period range provides another chance to study the bizarre behavior of this type of cv .",
    "these systems , characterized by rather high accretion rates , are flanked by the period gap for @xmath22hr and by dwarf novae with much lower accretion rates , such as ugem or ippeg , for @xmath23hr .",
    "besides the empirical determination of the accretion flow in these high @xmath24 systems between 3 - 4 hrs , the underlying deficiency in our understanding of cv evolution is the cause of the high mass transfer rates - are they related to a peculiar characteristic of the primary or to more activity from the secondary ?",
