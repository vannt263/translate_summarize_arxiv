    "this paper is a sequel to our work @xcite , where we analyzed theoretically the application of quasi - monte carlo ( qmc ) methods combined with finite element ( fe ) methods for a scalar , second order elliptic partial differential equation ( pde ) with random diffusion .",
    "the diffusion is assumed to be given as an infinite series with random coefficients . as in @xcite , we consider the model parametric elliptic dirichlet problem @xmath6 for @xmath7 a bounded domain with a lipschitz boundary @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , or @xmath10 is assumed given and fixed ( we do not track the dependence of constants on @xmath11 in this work ) . in",
    ", the gradients are understood to be with respect to the physical variable @xmath12 which belongs to @xmath13 , and the parameter vector @xmath14 consists of a countable number of parameters @xmath15 which we assume , as in @xcite , to be i.i.d .  uniformly distributed .",

    "we impose a number of assumptions on @xmath24 and @xmath22 as well as on the domain  @xmath13 :    ( * a1 * ) : :    we have @xmath25 and    @xmath26 .",

    "( * a6 * ) : :    the domain @xmath13 is a convex and bounded polyhedron with    plane faces .    in this paper we impose one additional assumption :    ( * a7 * ) : :    for @xmath38 as in ( * a3 * ) , there exists    @xmath39 $ ] such that    @xmath40 .",
    "we now briefly comment on each assumption . assumption ( * a1 * ) ensures that the coefficient @xmath20 is well - defined for all parameters @xmath41 .",
    "assumption ( * a2 * ) yields the strong ellipticity needed for the standard fe analysis .",
    "assumption ( * a3 * ) is stronger than the second part of assumption ( * a1 * ) .",
    "this assumption implies decay of the fluctuation coefficients @xmath22 , with faster decay for smaller @xmath38 .",
    "the value of @xmath38 determines the convergence rate in the previous paper @xcite .",
    "assumption ( * a4 * ) guarantees that the fe solutions converge to the solution of . assumption ( * a5 * ) allows the truncation of the infinite sum in to , say , @xmath42 terms .",
    "this assumption is not needed in this paper when the functions @xmath22 satisfy an orthogonality property in relation to the fe spaces , see  [ ssec : ortho ] below .",
    "assumption ( * a6 * ) only simplifies the fe analysis and can be substantially relaxed .",
    "finally , assumption ( * a7 * ) is often stronger than assumptions ( * a3 * ) and ( * a4 * ) . the value of @xmath43 $ ] as well as that of @xmath32 will determine the qmc convergence rates to be shown in this paper .",
    "our aim in this paper is to extend the qmc fe algorithm of @xcite for the efficient computation of expected values of continuous linear functionals of the solution of to a _ multi - level _ setting so that the overall computational cost is substantially reduced .",
    "suppose the continuous linear functional is @xmath44 ( later we may impose stronger regularity assumption on @xmath45 , e.g. , @xmath46 ) .",
    "we are interested in approximating the integral @xmath47 where @xmath48^s }    g(u(\\cdot,(y_1,\\ldots , y_s,0,0,\\ldots)))\\,{\\mathrm{d}}y_1\\cdots{\\mathrm{d}}y_s\\;. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the ( single level ) strategy in @xcite was to ( i ) truncate the infinite sum in the expansion of the coefficient to @xmath42 terms , ( ii ) approximate the solution of the truncated pde problem using a fe method with mesh width @xmath1 , and ( iii ) approximate the integral using a qmc method ( an equal - weight quadrature rule ) with @xmath4 points in @xmath42 dimensions .",
    "the qmc fe algorithm can therefore be expressed as @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the fe solution of the truncated pde problem , and @xmath51 are qmc sample points which are judiciously chosen from the @xmath42-dimensional unit cube @xmath52^s$ ] .",
    "more precisely , the qmc rules considered in @xcite are _ randomly shifted lattice rules _ ; more details will be given in the next section .",
    "it was established in @xcite that the root - mean - square of the error @xmath53 over all random shifts is a _ sum _ of three parts : a truncation error , a qmc error , and a fe error .",
    "for example , in the particular case where assumption ( * a3 * ) holds with @xmath54 and @xmath55 , it was shown that the three additive parts of the error are of orders @xmath56 , @xmath2 , and @xmath57 , respectively , where @xmath58 is the number of fe nodes and @xmath11 is the spatial dimension .",
    "assuming the availability of a linear complexity fe solver in the domain @xmath13 ( e.g. , a multigrid method ) , the overall cost of the ( single level ) qmc fe algorithm is @xmath59 . there , as in the present paper , we assume that the functions @xmath22 and their ( piecewise - constant ) gradients are explicitly known , and that integration of any fe basis functions over a single element in the fe mesh is available at unit cost . in effect , we assume that the entries of the fe stiffness matrix can be computed exactly .",
    "the assessment of the impact of quadrature errors in the fe method is a classical problem , which is well studied and covered in texts , such as the monograph of ciarlet @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is the design and the error - versus - cost analysis of a _ multi - level _ extension of the single level algorithm developed in @xcite .",
    "the multi - level algorithm takes the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a nondecreasing sequence of truncation dimensions , @xmath62 denotes the fe approximation with mesh width @xmath63 of the pde problem with parametric input truncated at @xmath64 terms , with the convention @xmath65 , and @xmath66 denotes the ( randomly shifted ) qmc quadrature rule with @xmath67 points in @xmath64 dimensions .",
    "( for the practical form of the quadrature rule , including randomization , see below . ) assuming again the availability of a linear complexity fe solver in the domain @xmath13 , the overall cost of this multi - level qmc fe algorithm is therefore @xmath68 operations .",
    "again we use randomly shifted lattice rules , and we show that @xmath64 , @xmath67 , and @xmath69 enter the root - mean - square of the error @xmath70 over all random shifts in a _ combined additive and multiplicative manner_. upon choosing @xmath64 and @xmath67 in relation to @xmath63 appropriately at each level @xmath71 , we arrive at a dramatically reduced overall cost compared to the single level algorithm .",
    "the general concept of multi - level algorithms was first introduced by heinrich @xcite and reinvented by giles @xcite . since",
    "then the concept has been applied in many areas including high dimensional integration , stochastic differential equations , and several types of pdes with random coefficients .",
    "most of these works used multi - level monte carlo ( mc ) algorithms , while few papers considered multi - level qmc algorithms . the multi - level qmc fe algorithm proposed and analyzed here",
    "differs in several core aspects from the abstract multi - level qmc framework proposed in @xcite .",
    "it also differs from the multi - level mc approach which has recently been developed for elliptic problems with random input data of the general form in @xcite .",
    "the model considered here , as in @xcite , is infinite - dimensional .",
    "previous treatments of infinite - dimensional quadrature include @xcite with qmc methods , @xcite with mc methods , and @xcite with smolyak ( or sparse - grid ) quadrature .",
    "there is an important special case where the functions @xmath22 satisfy an orthogonality property in relation to the fe spaces , see ahead . in this case",
    "there is _ no dimension truncation error at any level _ ,",
    "that is , with @xmath64 chosen in an appropriate way we have @xmath72 .",
    "furthermore , due to the special structure of the expansion of the coefficient @xmath20 , the overall cost is only @xmath73 operations . to have this orthogonality property we need _ multiresolution _ function systems ; examples are given in ",
    "[ ssec : ortho ] .",
    "we emphasize that the eigenfunction system of the covariance operator does _ not _ have this property .",
    "one of the main findings of the present paper is that the error analysis of the multi - level qmc fe algorithm requires _",
    "smoothness of the parametric solution simultaneously with respect to the spatial variable @xmath12 and to the parametric variable  @xmath17_. another key point is that we require decay of stronger norms of the fluctuation coefficients @xmath22 , see assumption ( * a7 * ) . for the multi - level qmc fe algorithm",
    ", the convergence rate will be determined by both the values of @xmath74 in * ( a7 ) * and @xmath38 in * ( a3 ) * , rather than just the value of @xmath38 as for the single level algorithm in  @xcite . as in most modern analyses of qmc integration in high dimensions , we use parameters @xmath75 , known as _ weights _ , to describe the relative importance of the subset of the variables with labels in the finite subset @xmath76 .",
    "( these weights are to be distinguished from quadrature weights in , e.g. , gaussian quadrature formulas . ) in @xcite the weights were chosen to minimize a certain upper bound on the product of the _ worst case error _ and the norm in the function space , yielding a special form of weights called `` pod weights '' , which stand for  product and order dependent weights \" : @xmath77 where @xmath78 denotes the cardinality ( or the  order \" ) of the set @xmath79 .",
    "these weights are then determined by the two sequences : by @xmath80 , @xmath81 and by @xmath82 .",
    "the error bound obtained in the present paper is more complicated than the result in @xcite due to the multi - level nature of the algorithm , but we follow the same general principle for choosing weights .",
    "it turns out that the  optimal \" weights ( in the sense of minimizing an upper bound on the overall error ) for the multi - level qmc fe algorithm are again pod weights , but they are different from the pod weights for the single level algorithm in @xcite . in any case ,",
    "fast cbc construction algorithms for randomly shifted lattice rules are available for pod weights , see @xcite or @xcite for recent surveys , as well as @xcite .",

    "<S> the multi - level fe discretizations are combined with families of qmc methods ( specifically , randomly shifted lattice rules ) to estimate expected values of linear functionals of the solution , as in @xcite in the single level setting . here , the expected value is considered as an infinite - dimensional integral in the parameter space corresponding to the randomness induced by the random coefficient . in this paper </S>",

    "<S> , it is shown that the overall error of the expected value of the functionals of the solution ( i.e. , the root - mean - square error averaged over all shifts ) is of order @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the finest fe mesh width , or @xmath2 for arbitrary @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes the maximal number of qmc sampling points in the parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> for these scenarios , the total work for all pde solves in the multi - level qmc fe method is shown to be essentially of the order of _ one single pde solve at the finest fe discretization level _ , for spatial dimension @xmath5 with linear elements .    </S>",
