    "in classical mechanics there is an unambiguous notion of complete integrability , namely that a system with @xmath1 degrees of freedom must have @xmath1 ( poisson ) commuting constants of motion @xcite .",
    "finding the appropriate analog of this idea in quantum mechanics turns out to be frustratingly difficult : see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent discussion of the pitfalls encountered .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , sutherland persuasively advocates a definition of integrability that applies equally well to both classical and quantum systems of _ equal mass _ particles that can move far away from each other ( usually in one dimension ) , out of the range of any interaction between particles . in this asymptotic region ,",
    "the momentum of each individual particle is conserved .",
    "scattering processes where the particles begin and end in the asymptotic region are therefore characterized by the initial @xmath2 and final @xmath3 set of momenta .",
    "an integrable system is then understood to be one in which these two sets are identical . in the classical case , this means that varying the ` impact parameters ' for the scattering problem does not change the set of final momenta , while in the quantum case , the scattering amplitude vanishes for all other assignments of momenta to the outgoing particles . note that in either case , the identity of these two sets does not exclude momenta from being exchanged among the particles undergoing scattering . in analogy with optics , scattering with this character is called _ non - diffractive_.    despite being superficially rather different , it is not hard to see that these two notions of integrability coincide in the classical case .",
    "whatever the general form of the @xmath1 constants of the motion for the @xmath1 particles undergoing scattering , they must be equivalent to ( i.e. functionally dependent upon ) the @xmath1 momenta in the asymptotic region , which are therefore unchanged after scattering . in quantum mechanics , the _ bethe ansatz _",
    "is the non - diffractive form of the @xmath1-particle wavefunction that forms the foundation for the study of integrable systems in one dimension .",
    "for @xmath4 particles , energy and momentum conservation guarantee @xmath5 .",
    "the distinction between integrable and nonintegrable systems therefore appears first for @xmath6 particles . for an incoming plane wave @xmath7",

    "this part is the bethe ansatz wavefunction , and for an integrable system there is nothing more ( strictly we must write an expression of this form in each of the six asymptotic regions @xmath11 , for all six permutations @xmath12 , but we do not include this extra detail for now ) .",
    "the second term , appearing only for nonintegrable systems , is the diffracted wave , a superposition of plane waves where the momenta are restricted to a ( 1d ) manifold of fixed total momentum @xmath13 and energy @xmath14 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath15 is the _ diffraction amplitude_.    for a nonintegrable hamiltonian the three body problem is intractable , even in one dimension .",
    "however , a system that is close to integrable , that is , whose hamiltonian deviates only a little from that of an integrable model , is expected to display a small amount of diffractive scattering . while the primary goal of this work is to obtain the diffraction amplitude for three particles in this limit , we also seek an understanding of _ why _ diffraction is sometimes absent . in the theory of integrable systems , a distinguished role",
    "is played by the _ yang  baxter equation _ , a relation obeyed by the two particle @xmath16-matrix of an integrable hamiltonian . in deriving our result , we will see how the violation of the yang ",
    "baxter equation gives rise to diffraction .",
    "our result yields valuable insight into how the defining characteristic of integrable systems breaks down upon changing the hamiltonian .",
    "a more practical motivation is provided by recent experiments on one dimensional ultracold atomic gases @xcite , showing essentially no relaxation towards an equilibrium state . recall that in a three dimensional gas , the dominant process of equilibration is binary collisions between gas particles , whose effect on the evolution of the distribution function is described by the boltzmann equation . in one dimension",
    ", such collisions result in @xmath17 , @xmath18 , or @xmath19 , @xmath20 , which does not alter the distribution of particles in momentum space and therefore can not lead to equilibration .",
    "evidently diffractive scattering is required , and three particle collisions will be the most important at low density @xcite .",
    "we defer to the conclusion further discussion of kinetics due to three particle collisions .    to",
    "what extent are one dimensional atomic gases described by integrable hamiltonians , or those close to integrable ? as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , tight confinement in the two transverse directions allows the interaction between a pair of atoms to be described by a @xmath0-function @xmath21 a gas of atomic bosons therefore provides ( ignoring any confining potential along the length of the gas ) a realization of the lieb  liniger model of the 1d bose gas @xcite , soluble by the bethe ansatz . to destroy integrability",
    "one may add external potentials , introduce a more complicated ( finite range ) interaction between the particles , or consider multiple species . while species with different masses certainly lead to diffractive scattering ( as the above considerations should make clear ) , a more relevant situation in ultracold physics is to consider different internal states of the atoms ( e.g. different hyperfine states ) , in which cases all masses remain identical .",
    "however , the interparticle interaction is dependent upon the species involved , and this again leads to a nonintegrable hamiltonian .",
    "since the variation in the interaction strengths is typically on the order of a few percent , this provides a natural setting for the question of how weak violations of integrability give rise to diffractive scattering .      motivated by the above discussion",
    ", we take as our principal example the three particle hamiltonian @xmath22 all masses are equal to @xmath23 , and we will assume without loss of generality that all three particles are distinguishable  the scattering amplitude for the case where two particles are identical bosons or fermions can be constructed later by symmetrizing or antisymmetrizing the solution . the simplicity of eq .",
    "is deceptive : other than the case @xmath24 soluble by the bethe ansatz , only a few other special cases have been solved to date @xcite . the general formulation of the problem given in refs .",
    "@xcite is forbiddingly complex , involving the solution of a system of functional equations ( see eq .  ) . in contrast , we are interested in finding the diffraction amplitude when @xmath25",
    ". numerical treatments of various aspects of the scattering problem can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .        for eq .  ,",
    "the result _ could _ be obtained using perturbation theory , starting from the bethe ansatz form of the wavefunction . however , such an approach makes no explicit connection to the violation of the yang  baxter equation , and obscures the fact that the diffraction amplitude can be expressed using only two particle scattering data .",
    "this last feature strongly suggests that the result is applicable to _ finite range _ interactions close to integrable and not just to @xmath0-function interactions . as an example , the interaction potential @xmath26 is integrable @xcite ) , so a small deviation from this potential will introduce a correspondingly small amount of diffractive scattering , described by our main result , eq .  .",
    "the solution of the three body problem is greatly facilitated by the use of the following picture @xcite . by momentum conservation",
    "the wavefunction has only trivial dependence on the @xmath27 direction in @xmath28 space , corresponding to center of mass motion , and we may restrict our attention to the plane perpendicular to this direction . in this plane , the surfaces @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 appear as three lines at angle @xmath32 to each other , cutting the plane into six sectors corresponding to the 6 possible permutations of the positions of the particles on the line ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mirrors ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian describing propagation in the plane is just the two dimensional laplacian , with the @xmath0-function interactions corresponding to boundary conditions at the surfaces .",
    "we note that the effect of different masses may be incorporated into this picture by rescaling the spatial coordinates , so that the kinetic energy in the centre of mass frame is isotropic , at the expense of altering the angles between the three planes .",
    "let us try to describe the above two dimensional wave problem using geometrical optics .",
    "we first find the transmission and reflection coefficients for each of the three surfaces , which are defined by the following two particle wavefunction @xmath33 a straightforward calculation using the hamiltonian eq .",
    "yields @xmath34 eq .",
    "describes a collision in which transmission leads to the particle with momentum @xmath35 overtaking the particle with momentum @xmath36 .",
    "when tracing rays in the two dimensional picture , then , this means that @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the angle between the ray and the plane , and @xmath39 is the magnitude of the momentum in the centre of mass frame",
    ". we will therefore write the transmission and reflection as a function of @xmath40 as @xmath41    ( a )    ( b )    ( c )    with this convention fixed , we consider different ray trajectories with the same arrival and departure angles ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3rays ] ) .",
    "all three rays illustrated have the same path length , so the difference in their associated amplitudes arises entirely from the reflections and transmissions each experiences . for the outgoing wavefront to the right of the dotted line ,",
    "two trajectories contribute , depending on whether the wave is first transmitted or reflected , so the overall amplitude is the sum @xmath42 with @xmath43 . to the left of the dotted line",
    ", only one trajectory contributes , with amplitude @xmath44 _ if _ the amplitudes in eq .   and eq .   are equal , it is plausible that the outgoing wave in sector 213 can be written as a plane wave with amplitude equal to this common value .",
    "returning to the three particle picture : if the incoming wave in sector 123 corresponds to @xmath45 , the outgoing wave in sector 213 corresponds to @xmath46 , where the subscript @xmath47 on the amplitude indicates how the momenta have been permuted . comparing with eq .",
    ", we see that this corresponds to one term of the bethe ansatz wavefunction .    for the outgoing rays corresponding to the other permutations of the momenta",
    ", one could draw similar sets of trajectories . once again",
    ", if equality holds between amplitudes for rays contributing to different parts of the outgoing wavefront , it seems plausible  and we will show explicitly later  that the bethe ansatz gives the complete form of the wavefunction . that is , there is no diffraction .    the required equality of eq .   and",
    ".   for arbitrary @xmath40 is ( one component of ) the yang  baxter equation .",

    "what happens in the general case ?",
    "in qualitative terms , the wavefronts to the right and left of the dotted line in fig .  [ fig:3rays ] will not ` match ' , having different amplitudes . as we move away from the geometrical optics limit ,",
    "we expect diffraction to smear out this discontinuity , which sheds light on the connection between the violation of the yang  baxter equation and the appearance of diffractive scattering .",
    "we next turn to the main tool that will be used to make this connection precise .",
