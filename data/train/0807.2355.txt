    "generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) have emerged during the past decade as a powerful concept and tool to study nucleon structure .",
    "they describe , among many other aspects , the ( correlated ) spatial and momentum distributions of the quarks in the nucleon ( including polarisation information ) , its quark - antiquark content , a way to access the orbital momentum of the quarks , etc .    formally , in short , the gpds are fourier transforms of matrix elements in quantum chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) for light - cone bilocal operators between nucleon states of different momenta . for helicity conserving quantities in the quark sector ,",
    "there are four gpds , @xmath1 which depend , in leading order and leading twist qcd , upon three variables : @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . both @xmath2 and @xmath3 express the longitudinal momentum fractions of the two quarks of the bilocal operator , while @xmath4 is the squared four - momentum transfer between the final and initial nucleon",
    "experimentally , gpds are most simply accessed through the measurement of exclusive leptoproduction of a photon ( deep virtual compton scattering -dvcs- ) and , possibly , of a meson .",
    "gpds are then accessed through the factorization with an elementary perturbative process , which leads to the so - called handbag diagram , predicted to be dominant at small @xmath4 and large @xmath5 , where @xmath5 is the virtuality of the initial photon .",
    "[ fig : dvcs ] shows schematically these notions for the dvcs process on the proton on which , as a first step , we will concentrate our work and discussion in this article . indeed",
    "the leading twist contribution is expected to be the most directly accessible for dvcs and proton targets currently provide ( and will also provide in the near future ) the richest data set .",
    "we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite for the original theoretical articles and recent comprehensive reviews on gpds for more details on the theoretical formalism of gpds and dvcs .",
    "= 9.cm = 10.cm    concerning actual data , the field is now rapidly growing .",
    "the first data related to dvcs on the proton were the beam spin asymmetries ( bsa ) which have been published by the hermes  @xcite and clas  @xcite collaborations in 2001 .",
    "although the kinematic range over which the data were integrated was large and , to some extent , the actual exclusivity of the reaction could be disputed , these were the first very encouraging signals that the handbag diagram could be accessed , since several theoretical predictions were in relatively good agreement with the data . then , longitudinally  @xcite and transversely  @xcite polarized target spin asymmetries as well as beam charge asymmetries  @xcite were measured which , though suffering from the same experimental limitations as the bsas , also confirmed the general theoretical expectations .    with these first encouraging signals found in non - dedicated experiments ,",
    "a second generation of dvcs experiments has been launched in the past few years , with fully dedicated detectors , i.e. high resolution electromagnetic calorimeters at jefferson lab ( jlab ) to detect the final - state photon and a recoil detector at hermes to detect the recoil proton .",
    "this has resulted in the publication of the first proton dvcs cross sections ( beam - polarized and unpolarized ) in the valence region at a few precise kinematical points by the jlab hall a collaboration  @xcite and several bsas over a large kinematic range by the jlab hall b collaboration  @xcite .",
    "hermes results with the recoil detector are now eagerly awaited .",
    "the field looks extremely promising with a series of novel experiments planned , in particular at jlab , aimed at accurately measuring new dvcs observables , including :    * longitudinally polarized target spin asymmetries and cross sections ( along with double polarizations observables ) with jlab experiment e05114  @xcite , * transversely polarized target spin asymmetries and cross sections ( along with double polarisations observables ) with jlab experiment e08021  @xcite , * new precise ( unpolarized and beam - polarized ) cross sections at new kinematics with jlab experiments e06003  @xcite and e07007  @xcite .",
    "a similar experimental program in the longer term future is planned with the jlab 12 gev upgrade , which will cover a larger phase space ( see jlab approved experiments e1206114  @xcite and e1206119  @xcite ) .    anticipating this rich harvest of data",
    ", one asks the question how to extract the gpd information from them .",
    "we recall that the dvcs process is accompanied by the bethe - heitler ( bh ) process , in which the final state photon is radiated by the incoming or scattered electron and not by the nucleon itself .",
    "the bh process , which is not sensitive to gpds , is experimentally indistinguishable from the dvcs and interferes with it , thus complicating the matter .",
    "considering that the nucleon form factors are well - known at small @xmath4 , the bh process is however precisely calculable theoretically .",
    "another issue is that the gpds , which are a function of the three variables @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , enter the dvcs amplitude within a convolution integral over @xmath2 .",
    "only @xmath3 and @xmath4 are accessible experimentally ( in the bjorken limit , @xmath6 in which @xmath7 is the standard bjorken variable ) .",
    "formally , the dvcs amplitude is proportional to : @xmath8 ( where the ellipsis stands for similar terms for @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) . decomposing this expression into a real and an imaginary part ,",
    "we find that the maximum information that can be extracted from the experimental data at a given ( @xmath12 ) point is @xmath13 , when measuring an observable sensitive to the imaginary part of the dvcs amplitude , and @xmath14 , when measuring an observable sensitive to the real part of the dvcs amplitude .",
    "if ones reduces the range of @xmath2 from @xmath15 to @xmath16 in the convolutions , there are in principle eight gpd - related quantities that can be extracted : @xmath17 c^+(x , \\xi),\\label{eq : eighta }   \\\\ & & p \\int_0 ^ 1 d x \\left [ e(x , \\xi , t ) - e(-x , \\xi , t ) \\right ] c^+(x , \\xi),\\label{eq : eightb }   \\\\ & & p \\int_0 ^ 1 d x \\left [ \\tilde h(x , \\xi , t ) + \\tilde h(-x , \\xi , t ) \\right ] c^-(x , \\xi),\\label{eq : eightc }   \\\\ & & p \\int_0 ^ 1 d x \\left [ \\tilde e(x , \\xi , t ) + \\tilde e(-x , \\xi , t ) \\right ] c^-(x , \\xi),\\label{eq : eightd }   \\\\ & & h(\\xi , \\xi , t ) - h(- \\xi , \\xi , t),\\label{eq : eighte } \\\\ & & e(\\xi , \\xi , t ) - e(- \\xi , \\xi , t),\\label{eq : eightf } \\\\ & & \\tilde h(\\xi , \\xi , t ) - \\tilde h(- \\xi , \\xi , t ) \\text{and}\\label{eq : eightg } \\\\ & & \\tilde e(\\xi , \\xi , t ) - \\tilde e(- \\xi , \\xi , t)\\label{eq : eighth } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath18    we will call these , respectively , in a symbolic notation , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "these are also often called the compton form factors ( cffs ) . note here the absence of @xmath27 factors in our definition of the @xmath28 cffs with respect to ref .  @xcite .",
    "in the following , for convenience and in a very loose way , we will speak of _ real part _ cffs and _ imaginary part _ cffs to designate generically the cffs defined by eqs .",
    "[ eq : eighta]-[eq : eightd ] and by eqs .",
    "[ eq : eighte]-[eq : eighth ] , respectively and which correspond to the cffs associated with the real and the imaginary parts of the dvcs amplitudes , respectively .",
    "the cffs can be decomposed into terms for individual quark flavors which , for the proton , yields : @xmath29 and similarly for @xmath9 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . the quark flavor separation , which we will not tackle in this study ,",
    "can be carried out by measuring dvcs on a neutron target , which yields a different quark flavor combination .",
    "the first measurements of the neutron bsa have been recently published  @xcite .    in summary , given the interference of the bh process , the deconvolution issue regarding @xmath2 and the large number ( 8) of independent quantities to be extracted from the data , it is clearly a non - trivial task to extract the gpds from the experimental data and , ultimately to map them in the three variables @xmath32 .",
    "the first stage of any general program of measuring gpds should certainly be to extract the eight cffs from the data for a given @xmath12 point , in a model - independent way .",
    "this would be only the beginning of the program , since the @xmath2 dependence would still need to be deconvoluted using in principle a model with adjustable parameters . at this stage ,",
    "let us mention that there might actually be a couple of ways around this issue : firstly , if the double - dvcs process , ( i.e. with a virtual photon in the final state ) can be measured , then varying the virtuality of the final state photon provides an extra lever arm and this allows us to measure the gpds at each @xmath32 values ( though with some limitations if the final photon is timelike )  @xcite .",
    "secondly , dispersion relations could in principle reduce from eight to five the number of gpd quantities to be extracted , by expressing the real part cffs defined by eqs .  [ eq : eighta]-[eq : eightd ] in terms of integrals over @xmath3 of the respective imaginary part cffs defined by eqs .",
    "[ eq : eighte]-[eq : eighth ] , plus a real subtraction constant ( at fixed @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) .",
    "this strategy requires one to measure data over a very wide range in @xmath3 ( at fixed @xmath4 ) unless one has good reasons to truncate the integral or to extrapolate .",
    "we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite for discussions on this subject and , in particular , to ref .",
    "@xcite for actual fits to the dvcs data in collider kinematics .    as a first approach , in this article",
    ", we focus our study on the most general case , in which the eight quantities of eq .",
    "[ eq : eighta]-[eq : eighth ] are independent .",
    "our present purpose is to understand to what extent , given the leading twist and leading order qcd dvcs amplitude , the cffs can be extracted from various observables .",
    "we present our work in three steps , corresponding to the next three sections . in the next section",
    ", we present the general framework of the fitting code that we have developed .",
    "in particular , we present the tests that we have carried out in a monte - carlo approach using simulated data . with ideal ( i.e. insignificant ) statistical error bars , we will learn general features such as which observable is sensitive to which cff , what are the highest reconstruction efficiencies that one can expect to achieve in such ideal conditions , etc .",
    "in the following section , we will simulate real experimental conditions by introducing a smearing of the simulated data together with realistic error bars .",
    "we will then discuss the resulting reconstruction efficiencies and the uncertainties on the reconstructed gpd parameters .",
    "finally , in a last stage , in section  [ halla ] , we will apply our fitting code to the recent jlab hall a dvcs data and will attempt to extract quantitatively some of the first real gpd quantities .",
    "in this section , we present the general features of our fitter code and , in particular , the way we have tested it and established its reliability and efficiency . our fitter code is simply based on the merging of the well established vgg  @xcite code , which calculates numerically , using model cffs , the leading order and leading twist handbag dvcs + bh amplitudes and observables , and the well known minuit minimization program from cern  @xcite .",
    "the vgg code uses its own models for the gpds but in fact any gpd model can be used . for our fitting purposes ,",
    "the idea is to consider the cffs that enter the dvcs amplitude as free parameters to be fitted and to see how well they can be extracted from the dvcs monte - carlo ( mc ) data .",
    "we have started by testing and studying our code with pseudo - data .",
    "the procedure we have followed is based on a mc approach and can be summarized by the following general steps ; for a given experimental kinematic point uniquely defined by @xmath33 , @xmath5 , @xmath3 and @xmath4  ( @xmath33 being the beam energy ) :    1 .",
    "we generate randomly a set of values for the quantities @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , 2 .   from these values , we calculate various observables which we will detail shortly as a function of @xmath34 , the azimuthal angle between the leptonic and hadronic planes , 3 .",
    "we fit with our code these distributions with eight  parameters \" , which are meant to correspond to @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , 4 .",
    "we finally compare the fitted values to the generated ones and draw our conclusions .",
    "this procedure is going to be looped over several hundred times , exploring the whole phase space of values , within given limits , that can be taken by @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in doing so , we do not make any assumption or do not take into account any information on the absolute or the relative values of the generated gpds , such as , for example , whether @xmath23 is dominant over @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which could well be the case in reality . in this way , we place ourselves , in the framework of this very general study , in the  blindest \" , the least biased and the most conservative of situations .",
    "entering physically motivated information or contraints on the cffs can of course only improve the results that we obtain . before presenting the results of our monte - carlo study ,",
    "let us mention a few details .",
    "we will consider nine independent observables which can be expected to be measured with relatively good accuracy in the near future .",
    "these are : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . here",
    "@xmath35 refers to the unpolarized cross section .",
    "when there are two indices , @xmath44 refers to the difference of polarized cross sections and the two indices refer respectively to the polarization of the beam and of the target ( i.e. @xmath36 is the difference of cross sections with a longitudinally polarized beam and an unpolarized target , as has been measured recently by the jlab hall a collaboration  @xcite , and @xmath42 corresponds to the difference of cross sections that can be obtained with a longitudinally polarized beam and a longitudinally polarized target ) .",
    "finally , @xmath43 refers to the difference of unpolarized cross sections between a negative and a positive lepton beam , i.e. proportional to the beam charge asymmetry measured by hermes  @xcite .    regarding the parameters to be fitted , as a first approach , we have taken into account only seven cffs , instead of eight : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , i.e. we have set @xmath26 to @xmath45 .",
    "the reason is that the gpd @xmath11 is usually associated with the pion pole @xmath4-channel exchange which is real .",
    "nothing keeps us in principle from considering @xmath26 and taking it as an extra free parameter in the fit . however , there is also clearly no need to complicate the fit procedure if it is not justified .",
    "conversely , we have decided to let @xmath22 be a free parameter , even though it is supposed to reflect the pion pole and is therefore well - constrained . in this way , the conjecture that @xmath11 comes from the pion pole can be verified .",
    "if this conjecture proves false , the whole parametrization of @xmath11 will clearly have to be revisited including its imaginary contribution .",
    "thus @xmath46 is the only model assumption that we will make in this study .",
    "also , we have decided to take as fit parameters , not the cffs of eq .",
    "[ eq : eighta]-[eq : eighth ] themselves , but the deviations with respect to them .",
    "this is not an assumption , simply a convention .",
    "in other words , we take some ( supposedly ) realistic reference values for @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 and fit the coefficients that multiply these reference values to the mc data . therefore in our mc study",
    ", we are going to generate randomly , in a given range , seven real numbers that multiply the seven reference cffs . from these new ( random ) cffs",
    ", we generate the dvcs observables .",
    "we fit them and our aim is to recover the seven initial multiplicative coefficients , knowing the numerical values of the reference cffs",
    ". we will call these multiplicative coefficients , the gpd multipliers and denote them as @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 . similarly to the cffs , in the following , for convenience , we will speak of _ real part _ and _ imaginary part _ multipliers , although , mathematically , all these numbers are obviously real .",
    "these can be interpreted as  ratios \" of the fitted cffs to the reference cffs .",
    "clearly , this is only a matter of convention and instead of these gpd multipliers , we could certainly have generated and fitted @xmath19 , @xmath20 , etc . directly .",
    "our general motivation is to create the most efficient and robust code by starting the minimization procedure as close as possible to the true solution .",
    "this implies that the reference cffs must be as realistic as possible .",
    "for these reference cffs , we have taken , as a first approach , those given by the vgg parametrization .",
    "it is by no means infered that the vgg parametrization is the most realistic one that currently can be found in the literature , but this was obviously the most convenient choice in our case because they provide a decent description of several existing dvcs experimental data  @xcite .",
    "however , it is clear that instead of vgg as a reference , any other gpd model could be taken .    in the present study ,",
    "we have generated seven numbers @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the range we have considered is @xmath54 .",
    "this means that we allow the randomly generated cffs to vary in absolute value up to a factor @xmath55 from the vgg value .",
    "this range @xmath54 is quite arbitrary and does not have any significant impact on the subsequent results of this section .",
    "whether such large variations from the vgg cffs are realistic or not is not particularly the object of this section which is meant as an exercice , testing the ability to extract gpds .",
    "let us just mention that the gpds of the vgg code are normalized and respect the various model - independent relations ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the unpolarized and polarized parton distributions functions of flavor @xmath60 , respectively ) and sum rules ( @xmath61 , etc . ) . although these relations are quite constraining and do not permit a fully arbitrary normalisation of the gpds , let us note that there are contributions to the gpds which can escape any formal normalization constraints .",
    "for instance , the so - called @xmath62-term  @xcite , which cancels at @xmath3=0 and is odd in @xmath2 so that it does not contribute to the form factor sum rule , is such a contribution .",
    "also , gpd parametrizations based on other approaches such as in ref .",
    "@xcite can find in the valence region an @xmath0 gpd larger by a factor 2 to 3 compared to vgg .",
    "once the seven initial multipliers are generated , the next step is to calculate with the vgg code the dvcs+bh amplitude and the various ( unpolarized , singly polarized , doubly polarized ) resulting cross sections .",
    "we recall that , in this study , we restrict ourself to leading - twist . however , in order to ensure gauge invariance of the dvcs amplitude , we mention that the vgg amplitude contains a small ( on the order of 10% depending on the kinematics ) twist-3 contribution  @xcite .",
    "since wandura - wilczek kinematical twist-3  @xcite and some other contributions to higher twists are also available in the vgg code ( @xmath63 effects for instance )  @xcite , let us mention that fits can also be done beyond leading twist at the cost of longer computing time .",
    "= 9.cm = 10.cm    at given @xmath33 , @xmath3 , @xmath5 and @xmath4 values , we generate the @xmath34 distributions of the nine observables previously mentioned .",
    "[ fig : example ] shows such distributions calculated from the set of randomly generated @xmath64 multipliers which are displayed in table  [ tab : param ] .",
    "the kinematics correspond to that of the recent jlab hall a data  @xcite : @xmath33=5.75 gev , @xmath7=0.36 ( corresponding to @xmath3= 0.22 ) , @xmath5=2.3 gev@xmath65 and @xmath66=0.28 gev@xmath65 .",
    "our goal is therefore to recover the @xmath64 values of table  [ tab : param ] from the fit to the @xmath34 distributions of fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] . once again , we recall that these values are the coefficients that multiply the vgg cffs , i.e. not the cffs themselves .",
    "the corresponding vgg cffs are also displayed in table  [ tab : param ] .",
    "the vgg code has several options for the parametrization of the gpds .",
    "as we said , it does not really matter which particular option is used since the vgg cffs are just meant to be used as starting or reference values and what is ultimately extracted are the deviations from these values .",
    "we have used the regge inspired unfactorized ansatz for the @xmath4-dependence  @xcite of @xmath0 and @xmath9 , a factorized @xmath4 dependence ansatz for @xmath10 and the pion pole for the modelling of @xmath11 .",
    "also , no @xmath62-term was used and the parameters @xmath67 in the profile function of the double distributions were selected .",
    "obviously , since the gpd multipliers of table  [ tab : param ] have been randomly generated for our study , they have no particular meaning , and the curves of fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] have no relation to the actual @xmath35 and @xmath36 that the jlab hall a collaboration has measured at similar kinematics .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     = 10.cm = 10.cm    we display in table  [ tab : gpd ] the vgg reference values which , by multiplying the @xmath64 gpd multipliers and their associated errors of table  [ tab : param2 ] , allow us to extract the measured values of the cffs themselves .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : fin ] the measurements of the two multipliers @xmath51 and @xmath47 and the associated cffs for the @xmath4 values for which they have finite uncertainties . in this figure ,",
    "we show three results for each @xmath4 for @xmath51 and @xmath23 .",
    "these correspond to the fits with the domains of variations @xmath68 ,",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath70 from left to right , respectively .",
    "the stability of the central value as well as the moderate increase of the error bar with the increase of the limit of the domain previously mentioned can be observed .",
    "as deviations of cff values by a factor 7 ( or even 5 ) from vgg predictions are not easy to conceive , the uncertaintities quoted in table  [ tab : param2 ] and displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fin ] are very conservative .",
    "they could be reduced if , based on some models or educated guesses , smaller limits could be set on the other cffs .",
    "one should also note from table  [ tab : param2 ] that all fits have a @xmath71 close to 1 except for the bin at @xmath72 gev@xmath65 .",
    "we remark that a problem with this same bin was also observed in ref .",
    "@xcite where , in an analysis mainly devoted to the jlab hall b bsas , the jlab hall a bsas , i.e. @xmath73 , were fitted by the phenomenological function @xmath74 where the @xmath75 coefficient was found to take a peculiar value for this particular @xmath4 bin , in clear distinction from the surrounding @xmath4 bins . also , in the present analysis ,",
    "although the results for @xmath48 and @xmath49 are not very meaningful because of their @xmath76 uncertainties , one can nevertheless clearly observe a discontinuity in their fitted values as they jump rather abruptly from a largely negative values at the three low @xmath4 values to a largely positive value for the last @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , there definitely seems to be a change of behavior in the data at this large @xmath4 bin .",
    "a bad @xmath71 may be indicating that our theoretical modeling is not appropriate .",
    "we recall that our analysis has been carried out at the twist-2 handbag level and that this intriguing change might signal the rise of higher twist corrections .",
    "let us also mention that still a few more pieces of information can be extracted from the values of table  [ tab : param2 ] . for several @xmath4 values",
    ", @xmath50 has finite uncertainties .",
    "since these error bars are systematically over 100% , it makes the information difficult to use , but we can simply note that the value of @xmath77 , which corresponds to the vgg pion pole , is never excluded and that our original assumption to neglect @xmath26 on this basis is therefore not ruled out .",
    "there are a few cases in table  [ tab : param2 ] where only one uncertainty ( @xmath78 in general ) is finite , which still yields some information .",
    "in particular , @xmath25 for all @xmath4 s has a reliable ( lower ) bound .",
    "we have also tried to fit only the @xmath36 observables ( i.e. without the simultaneous fit of @xmath35 ) which would be sensitive only to @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in general , the fitted central values for these cffs were unstable , unless we guided and constrained the fit by setting limits on the domain of variation of the parameters .",
    "in general , we obtained values of @xmath23 about 30% higher than those quoted in table  [ tab : param2 ] but they corresponded to much larger values of @xmath25 , compared to those of table  [ tab : param2 ] , which with its opposite sign would provide some compensation .",
    "this kind of unstability is not unexpected because fitting only one observable with three parameters is even less constraining than fitting two observables with seven parameters .",
    "finally , we tried to fit the numerous jlab hall b bsas  @xcite .",
    "we found that without any guidance of the fit or any physics input , no fit stability and robustness could be reached .",
    "this could actually be anticipated from our studies in the previous section . however , as we saw with fig .",
    "[ fig : events ] , guiding the fit by setting the initial values in minuit to values close to the expected ones , which can be relatively safely done for @xmath23 following our results on the hall a data that we just presented , could tremendously enhance the fit efficiency and stability .",
    "we delay to a forthcoming publication the results of such guided or educated fits .",
    "in sumary , we have developed a fitter program to extract gpd information from various dvcs observables at qcd leading twist and leading order .",
    "we have gained confidence in the program by checking its reliability and efficiency on simulated , ideal or realistic , pseudo - data .",
    "we came to the conclusion that by fitting enough unpolarized , singly and doubly polarized observables , with realistic experimental error bars , the code was able to extract in most cases the seven cffs considered in this work , even in a very blind framework where all parameters are left free and essentially unconstrained . applying realistic and educated constrains , such as dispersion relations or model motivated ansatzes ,",
    "can only reduce the number of independent parameters or limit the range of variation of certain parameters and therefore improve the efficiency and reliability of this fitter program .",
    "we recall that most of the aforementionned observables will be available in the near future from various experiments at jlab in particular .",
    "if only some of these nine observables are available , we have demonstrated that valuable partial gpd information could still be extracted : in particular , with @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath39 , which are planned to be measured in the very near future , the @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 cffs could be very reliably be known . for the real part cffs , one can either measure the beam charge difference of cross sections or double polarization observables .",
    "finally , we have extracted from the jlab hall a data first numerical values with associated uncertainties for the @xmath0 gpd combinations @xmath79 and @xmath80 c^+(x , \\xi)$ ] .",
    "the corresponding error bars are rather large because we are fitting more parameters than observables and no a priori knowledge of any cffs has been assumed in this study . ultimately , when enough observables are available , this should indeed not be needed , and we can consider that we have placed ourselves in this long - term perspective . in a forthcoming article , we will discuss strategies to reduce these uncertainties on the present data if educated assumptions are made about the cffs .",
    "this code is only the first step towards a general fitting procedure of dvcs data ( and potentially , if data lend themselves to a gpd interpretation , of exclusive meson electroproduction ) .",
    "numerous extensions of the code are possible , such as introducing qcd higher twists and/or higher order corrections , implementing dispersion relations , and so forth .    the author has benefitted from numerous discussions with many colleagues from jlab and from the french ",

    "<S> we have developed a fitting code based on the leading - twist handbag deep virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) amplitude in order to extract generalized parton distribution ( gpd ) information from dvcs observables in the valence region . in a first stage , with simulations and pseudo - data , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the full gpd information can be recovered from experimental data if enough observables are measured . </S>",
    "<S> if only some of these observables are measured , valuable information can still be extracted , with certain observables being particularly sensitive to certain gpds . in a second stage , we make a practical application of this code to the recent dvcs jefferson lab hall a data from which we can extract numerical constraints for the two @xmath0 gpd compton form factors . </S>"
