    "it is well known that the lagrangian and hamiltonian approaches for some non dissipative and some dissipative systems have some problems [ 1 - 6 ] .",
    "one of these problems consist in the possibility of having two different hamiltonian to the same classical system [ 7 ] , implying that one will have two different quantization for this system .",
    "another problem consist that for some dissipative non relativistic systems , like a free particle moving in a dissipative medium characterized by a force which depends on the square of the velocity of the particle , the trajectories on the space ( @xmath1 ) have an odd behavior .",
    "however , the trajectories on the space ( @xmath0 ) , defined by the constant of motion , have a good expected behavior [ 8 ] .",
    "+   + in this work , the study of this former problem is extended to the relativistic motion of the particle .",
    "the constant of motion , the lagrangian , and the hamiltonian are deduced consistently , and it is shown that the behavior of the trajectories of the particle in the phase space ( @xmath1 ) are odd when the hamiltonian approach is used .",
    "however , the trajectories in the space ( @xmath0 ) , when the constant of motion is used , behave as one could expected .",
    "the one - dimensional motion of a relativistic particle of mass @xmath2 at rest which is moving with a velocity @xmath3 in a dissipative medium characterized by a force which depends on the square of this velocity is described by the equation @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the dissipative parameter , @xmath6 is the speed of light , and @xmath7 is the relativistic factor , @xmath8 .",

    "( 1 ) represents a dissipative system for @xmath9 , otherwise it represents an anti - dissipative system .",
    "therefore , only the case @xmath9 will be considered below .",
    "this system can be written as the following dynamical system @xmath10 a constant of motion for this system is a function @xmath11 such that it satisfies the following partial differential equation of first order [ 9 ] @xmath12 the general solution of this equation [ 10 ] is given by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is an arbitrary function of the characteristic curve @xmath15 , @xmath16 by choosing @xmath17 , a constant of motion is gotten with energy units , @xmath18 the lagrangian of the system can be consistently deduced from the known expression @xmath19 which establishes the relation between the lagrangian and the constant of motion of the system [ 11 ] . using this expression",
    "it follows that @xmath20 the generalized linear momentum , @xmath21 , is given by @xmath22 the plot of this expression and the plot of the usual relativistic free linear momentum expression ( @xmath23 ) are shown in fig .",

    "as one can see , the falling down of these trajectories and the way they are falling as the parameter @xmath5 increases represent the behavior that one can expected for a dissipative medium .",
    "now , given these same initial conditions , the initial generalized linear momentum is calculated from expression ( 8) .",
    "one uses the expression ( 10a ) to determinate the value of this hamiltonian and to calculated the trajectories in the space ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "these trajectories can be seen in fig .",
