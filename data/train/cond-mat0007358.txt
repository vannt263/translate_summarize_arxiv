    "the phase behavior of fluid mixtures in confined geometry has attracted abiding interest over many decades.@xcite the preferential interactions at the surfaces give rise to an enrichment of one component at the surface . in a semi - infinite system at phase coexistence ,",
    "the thickness of this enrichment layer diverges at the wetting transition.@xcite upon approaching the wetting transition temperature from below the thickness of the enrichment layer might increase continuously ( second order wetting ) or jump from a microscopically thin layer to a macroscopic layer at the ( first order ) transition .",

    "landau ansatz this finding can be rationalized as follows : close to the tricritical point the coefficient @xmath192 is small and the temperature of the triple point is given by the condition @xmath193 or @xmath194 . at the tricritical film thickness @xmath195 the coefficient @xmath196 changes its sign . neglecting terms of order @xmath197 we obtain : @xmath198 . if the semi  infinite system exhibits a first order wetting transition the coefficients @xmath120 and @xmath64 are positive .",

    "@xmath205 @xmath123 is to a good approximation the effective potential of the nearest surface @xmath206 .",
    "@xmath203 corresponds to a temperature above the wetting ( triple ) transition but below the ( prewetting ) critical temperature of the thick film .",
    "each surface repels the @xmath3 interface and there is a shoulder in the effective interaction around @xmath207 .",
    "qualitatively , the scf calculations confirm that @xmath123 is the linear superposition of the interactions with each surface .",
    "when we decrease the film thickness larger values of @xmath115 become unfavorable , because the more the interface moves away from one surface the more it experiences the repulsion from the opposite surface .",

    "the shape of @xmath123 corresponds to a temperature below the triple point , i.e. , the interface is localized at one or the other surface .",

    "we expect a thin film to behave similar as a semi  infinite system .",
    "close to the critical point , however , the range of interaction @xmath211 between the surface and the @xmath3 interface increases .",
    "therefore we anticipate very pronounced finite size effects even for film thicknesses which exceed the end  to  end distance @xmath4 by far .",

    "qualitatively this is in agreement with scf calculations of carmesin and noolandi@xcite and monte carlo simulations@xcite which find only first order wetting transitions , except for the ultimate vicinity of the critical point which has not been investigated .",
    "the effective interface potential also determines the composition profiles across an interface between the laterally coexisting phases . at low temperatures the coexisting phases are almost completely segregated , i.e. , the thickness of the enrichment layers of the minority components are small . in this case",
    "the interface between the coexisting phases is planar and makes an angle @xmath215 with the surface .",

    "hence , the width of the interface between the coexisting phases diverges like @xmath220 where @xmath221 is the mean field exponent for the correlation length upon approaching the critical point .",
    "close to a first order interface localization  delocalization transition the effective interface potential exhibits more structure and this will modify the shape of the interface . within the mean field approximation the shape of the interface will minimize the effective interface free energy .",

    "note that the lateral interfacial width can exceed the film thickness by far in the vicinity of the triple temperature .",
    "the flatter portion in the center of the film is a consequence of the metastability of the third phase with composition @xmath142 or the additional local minima in @xmath123 , respectively . upon approaching the triple temperature",

    "this formula has been applied to analyze recent experiments.@xcite the behavior of the line tension close to the wetting transition depends on the order of the transition and the range of the monomer  wall interaction . for short range",
    "forces the line tension @xmath229 reaches a finite positive value at the wetting transition temperature , while it is negative far below the wetting temperature .",
    "the effective interface hamiltonian captures only the qualitative behavior .",
    "monte carlo simulations and scf calculations have shown that the properties of the @xmath3 interface depend on the distance @xmath115 from the surface .",
    "this gives rise to a position dependence of the tension@xcite and width of the @xmath3 interface.@xcite a more detailed description of the interface is provided by the two  dimension composition profiles in fig.[fig : profs ] .",
    "due to the choice of basis functions the profiles are periodic in @xmath223 direction and only half the system is shown .",

    "the contact angle at @xmath235 is about @xmath236 .",
    "upon increasing the temperature the contact angle between the surface and the interface decreases and the interface becomes @xmath228shaped in the vicinity of the triple point .",
    "the scf calculations also reveal that the interface becomes broader when we increase the temperature .",
    "moreover , the width of the interface is broader in the vicinity of the surfaces than in the middle of the film .",
    "this effect is due to the reduction of the monomer density in the vicinity of the surface , which imparts a reduced effective incompatibility ( `` missing neighbor effect '' ) on the surface region .",
    "a similar effects has been observed in confined systems containing copolymers@xcite this effect gives rise to a negative contribution to the line tension when the interface approaches the surface .",

    "this identification of the interface position via the absorbed amount is a good approximation for large distances between the surface and the @xmath3 interface . in this case , the composition profile across the @xmath3 interface is well describable by the interfacial profile between the coexisting bulk phases . if the @xmath3 interface is close to the surface , however , the profile becomes strongly distorted ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig : gfree ] ) and the definition of the interface position @xmath115 is somewhat ambiguous , but this is exactly the region which gives the dominant contribution to the line tension .",

    "an interesting interplay between mean field , 3d ising and 2d ising critical behavior is anticipated . in the limit of large interdigitation",
    ", however , we expect composition fluctuations to be only of minor importance for most part of the phase diagram .",
    "moreover , the interface profiles in the self - consistent field calculations are ideally flat , i.e. , there are no capillary waves of the interfaces .",

    "experiments and monte carlo simulations , however , do reveal a dependence of the lateral chain extension on the parameters above .",
    "partially , some of these effects can be rationalized as follows : if the film thickness is very thin the lateral chain extension @xmath267 has to increase as to restore a constant monomer density .",
    "this increase of the lateral chain extensions occurs if @xmath268 or @xmath269 . under these conditions the chains are quasi two  dimensional and the density of monomers belonging to the same chain inside the coil volume is not small .",
