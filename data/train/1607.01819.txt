    "next to minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) is an extension of minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) to solve the @xmath2 @xcite . according to kibble - zurek mechanism @xcite , the problematic cosmological domain walls which are topological defects",
    "would be created during the spontaneous discrete @xmath0 electroweak symmetry breaking at @xmath1 gev .",
    "it was first noted by zeldovic , kobzarev and okun in 1975 @xcite that if discrete symmetries of scalar field theory are spontaneously broken as the universe cools down , there would be further drastic problems in its evolution .",
    "if such domains remain they can over close the universe by dominating the energy density .",
    "it has been shown that these defects can cause huge amount of anisotropies in the cmb radiation , and to avoid this problem their energy scale must be less than a few mev @xcite . actually to be more concise",
    "it must be less than 0.93 mev @xcite .",
    "as an indispensable consequence , these problematic walls must be lifted before the nucleosynthesis era .",
    "it was first suggested by zeldovic _",
    "_ in @xcite that breaking the degeneracy of the vacua , eventually leads to the dominance of true vaccum . in this case",
    ", the difference in energy density between the distinct vacua begins to exceed the tension which leads to unstable domain wall @xcite . in this paper",
    "it is shown that the vacua degeneracy is impossible due to the fact that the random percolation threshold in three dimensions is less than @xmath3 @xcite ( for a review about percolation theory and its application see @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we want to look at the cosmological domain wall problem from a new perspective . in section ( [ sec.2 ] )",
    ", we study the conditions in which we could bring a universe filled with different @xmath0 vacua and a three dimensional three states potts model together in the same universality class .",
    "we use cardy - jacobsen ( c - j ) conjecture @xcite to prove that there might exists a tri - critical point in the nmssm electroweak symmetry breaking in the early universe .",
    "then in sections ( [ sec.3 ] ) and ( [ sec.4 ] ) , we use the landau theory to investigate the properties of a tri - critical phase transition in order to use them in early cosmology , i.e. an infinite energy release at constant temperature due to the divergence of heat capacity , or the divergence of correlation length which leads to a new mechanism for the cosmological structure formation and electroweak inhomogeneity problem . in this mechanism ,",
    "cosmological domain walls cause no problem and vanish at the tri - critical point , also there might be a late - time inflation due to trapping in a metastable state , which had been suggested and studied in @xcite to solve the thermal and non - thermal overproduction in the early universe .    in section ( [ sec.5 ] ) , we combine these results with yaffe - svetitsky ( y - s ) conjecture @xcite , to prove that there might exists a tri - critical point during the @xmath0 center symmetry breaking in a pure su(3 ) theory too .",
    "we study the cosmological consequences of this point at @xmath1 mev . at these energy scales",
    "we can neglect quarks as in quenched ( static quarks ) approximation of qcd , and there would be a pseudo - inflation mechanism in which without any exponential expansion of scale factor or further reheating , we have huge energy and entropy release .",
    "c - j conjecture predicts the effects of quenched disorder on systems that undergo a @xmath4 order phase transition in the ideal pure condition @xcite . according to this conjecture upon dilution , a @xmath4 order phase transition in a three dimensional three states",
    "potts model changes to a @xmath5 order at a tri - critical point @xcite .",
    "we want to use the number of randomly diluted sites together with the total surface area of domain clusters in order to present a relation for the thickness of domain clusters walls in a potts model with the nearest neighbors interaction .",
    "hamiltonian of a non - diluted potts model is @xcite :    @xmath6        here @xmath7 is the spin state of site @xmath8 with @xmath9s as its nearest neighbors . for simplicity , we consider a typical two states potts model in two dimensions fig .",
    "( [ fig.1 ] ) . in this figure",
    "green and blue sites represent up and down spin states . thin surface of the two - site blue domain cluster is displayed by red lines in fig .",
    "( [ fig.1].a ) . similarly , for other domain clusters we have these walls too .",
    "the problem is that walls thickness are not taken into account in the numerical lattice simulations .",
    "so the question is how can we take the walls thickness into our numerical simulations ? as we see in fig .",
    "( [ fig.1].b ) , a probable way is to dilute the neighbor sites of the cluster and use diluted potts hamiltonian    @xmath10    here each spin interacts with its nearest neighbors , and @xmath11 is occupation number which is zero for each neighbor site , else it is equal to one . according to this hamiltonian ,",
    "if one of the neighbors of site @xmath8 is diluted then its contribution would be zero .",
    "as a consequence , this configuration in fig .",
    "( [ fig.1].b ) leads to further problems in the evolution of two - site blue cluster with nearest neighbors interaction .",
    "due to the existence of diluted sites in the vicinity , this cluster is isolated from the rest of system .",
    "if we have these walls for other clusters , there wo nt be any evolution in the system by changing the temperature .    in order to avoid this problem ,",
    "we have two solutions : first , use potts model with a next to nearest neighbors hamiltonian .",
    "this solution might be useful for the simulations in the condensed matter realm , but not for the purposes of this paper . here",
    "we want to make a connection between a @xmath12 three states diluted potts model and an early universe filled with three different @xmath0 vacua created during an nmssm electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "actually our final goal is to bring them together in the same universality class .",
    "there exists a @xmath0 symmetry associated to the hamiltonian of these two systems in three spatial dimensions .",
    "for the nmssm electroweak vacua , we will see in the next sections that there might be a possibility for the neighbors to be connected beyond their casual horizon ( fig .",
    "( [ fig.2 ] ) ) , similar to the nearest neighbors interaction in the potts model .    with these three conditions , i.e. same symmetry of hamiltonian , number of spatial dimension , and range of interactions , no matter whether the universe expands or not",
    ", these two systems belong to the same universality class . as a result , near the ( tri)critical point we can study the properties of a diluted potts model and use them for the nmssm electroweak symmetry breaking with domain walls in the early universe .    the next probable solution to take the walls thickness into the numerical simulations",
    "would be random dilution @xcite .",
    "for this case as we see in fig .",
    "( [ fig.1].c ) , we randomly dilute some of the sites in our system . in order to make a relation between random dilution and domain walls structure , we define equivalent thickness @xmath13 as    @xmath14    here @xmath13 would be equivalent thickness of domain walls in the system if @xmath15 is total number of diluted sites , and @xmath16 is total surface area of domain clusters .",
    "we must pay attention that there is no thick walls in the random diluted potts model .",
    "in other words , _ random potts model with @xmath15 diluted sites and total domain clusters of surface area @xmath16 with zero thickness in numerical simulations is equal to a potts model with domain clusters walls of thickness @xmath13 _ .",
    "this simple statement would be an extremely helpful tool to make a connection between diluted sites in potts model and domain walls in the nmssm electroweak symmetry breaking to solve the cosmological domain walls problem .",
    "again we consider the two - site blue cluster in fig .",
    "( [ fig.1 ] ) ( for a complete calculation we must take all the domain clusters surfaces into account ) .",
    "according to eq.([eq.3 ] ) , the equivalent wall thickness for this domain cluster in fig .",
    "( [ fig.1].c ) and fig .",
    "( [ fig.1].d ) is    @xmath17    eq .",
    "( [ eq.3 ] ) suggests that an increase in the diluted sites is equal to an increase in the equivalent thickness of the walls .",
    "the subtle point is that near a tri - critical point in the evolution of a diluted potts model , the total surface area of domain walls diverges which leads to a zero equivalent thickness @xmath13 .",
    "later we will study this in more details .",
    "hamiltonian of a random site - diluted potts system is just like eq .",
    "( [ eq.2 ] ) .",
    "again random dilution is represented by occupation variable @xmath18 , but here the probability of occupation for each site is determined by concentration @xmath19 @xcite . according to c -",
    "j conjecture there exists a critical concentration at @xmath20 ( fig .",
    "( [ fig.3 ] ) ) @xcite . for @xmath21",
    "the phase transition line is @xmath4 order which would changes to @xmath5 order at a tri - critical point @xmath22 ( fig .",
    "( [ fig.3 ] ) ) . according to this figure ,",
    "more diluted sites leads to a decrease in critical temperature .",
    "when @xmath23 approaches the critical concentration @xmath22 along the @xmath4 order transition line , latent heat and surface tension would vanish @xcite . at",
    "this point correlation length diverges as well @xcite . at lower temperatures , @xmath0 symmetry breaks spontaneously and one of the three spin states starts to percolate and occupies the entire lattice ( fig .",
    "( [ fig.4 ] ) ) .",
    "we want to study the zero surface tension in more details .",
    "as susceptibility diverges at the tri - critical point ( see next section ) , the total surface area of domain clusters diverges too .",
    "near this point the total surface area of domain clusters become infinitely large and according to eq .",
    "( [ eq.3 ] ) , no matter how large diluted sites number is , the walls thickness approaches zero ( fig .",
    "( [ fig.5 ] ) ) .",
    "so there exists a critical number of diluted sites @xmath24 for which if @xmath25 the equivalent thickness is @xmath26 and phase transition would be first order .",
    "but when @xmath27 then @xmath28 and a tri - critical phase transition happens ( fig .",
    "( [ fig.5 ] ) ) .",
    "we can interpret the zero surface tension in another way . according to surface tension definition    @xmath29    and the fact that energy stored in domain clusters walls is limited , near a tri - critical point",
    "the total surface area of all clusters diverges and as a consequence the surface tension approaches zero .",
    "it is shown that this surfaces are fractal and unsmooth @xcite .",
    "later we will use this concepts in order to solve the cosmological domain wall problem . in the next section we study the properties of phase transition near a tri - critical point in landau theory .",
    "in landau theory , the general form of free energy as a function of order parameter is given by    @xmath30    here the condition @xmath31 requires that the power series only has even powers of @xmath32 .",
    "the minimum of the free energy defines the equilibrium state . for a tri - critical phase transition",
    "we have    @xmath33    the order parameter is    @xmath34    entropy become    @xmath35    for heat capacity and susceptibility we have    @xmath36    @xmath37    divergence of susceptibility implies the divergence of correlation length . in the next section ,",
    "we want to apply these results together with percolation theory and c - j conjecture to present a new mechanism to solve the cosmological domain walls created during the @xmath0 electroweak symmetry breaking in nmssm .",
    "minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is an extension to the standard model that realizes supersymmetry .",
    "three principle motivations for mssm are naturalness , gauge coupling unification , and dark matter @xcite .",
    "it considers only the minimum number of new particle states and new interactions consistent with phenomenology .",
    "next to minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) is a supersymmetric extension to standard model that adds an additional singlet chiral superfluid to the mssm and can be used to dynamically generate the @xmath38 term , solving the @xmath38-problem @xcite .",
    "the cubic renormalizable superpotential in nmssm is @xcite :    @xmath39    here @xmath40 and @xmath41 are higgs fields , @xmath42s are yukawa couplings , and @xmath43 is massless gauge singlet field coupled to the higgs field in the first term .",
    "the second term explicitly breaks the peccei - quinn symmetry , while violating no other wanted symmetry .    according to kibble - zurek mechanism @xcite , the @xmath0 discrete symmetry break during the phase transition associated with nmssm electroweak symmetry breaking at @xmath1 gev energy scale leads to the formation of domain walls which are topological defects .",
    "these walls would form at the boundaries of different degenerate vacua , and due to the existence of casual horizon in an expanding universe these degenerate vacua ca nt be in casual connection ( we will see that there is a possibility for these vacua to be casually connected beyond their horizons ) .",
    "it was first noted by zeldovic , kobzarev and okun @xcite , that if discrete symmetries of scalar field theory are spontaneously broken as the universe cools down , there would be further drastic problems in its evolution .",
    "if such domains remain they can over close the universe by dominating the energy density @xcite .",
    "it is shown that these defects can cause huge amount of anisotropies in the cmb , and to avoid this problem their energy scale must be less than a few mev @xcite . actually to be more concise",
    "it must be less than 0.93 mev @xcite .",
    "as an indispensable consequence these problematic walls must be lifted before the nucleosynthesis era .",
    "first suggested by zeldovic _",
    "_ @xcite . breaking the degeneracy of the vacua , eventually leads to the dominance of true vacuum .",
    "we want to see how previous discussions can solve the cosmological domain walls problem .",
    "the condition for the walls to be unstable and their energy density decays exponentially fast is @xcite :    @xmath44    here @xmath45 is pressure or difference in energy density between the two minima . @xmath46 and @xmath47 are surface energy density and radius curvature of the wall . for the cosmological walls @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the vacuum expectation value of the field which is of order @xmath50 gev for the electroweak energy scale .        just after the @xmath0 symmetry breaking , different uncorrelated regions in the early universe randomly choose one of the three vacua with probability 0.3333 . according to percolation theory",
    "the threshold probability @xmath51 for a random site percolation in three dimensions is 0.3116 @xcite .    due to the fact that @xmath52 , it is impossible to have three degenerate vacua . in this case",
    ", there is always a dominant vacuum which destroys the degeneracy , and if the difference in energy density become larger than surface tension of the wall as stated in eq .",
    "( [ eq.12 ] ) , then the walls become unstable and decay . as a consequence , there would be no cosmological domain wall problem . in this case ( uncorrelated domains ) , if @xmath53 the problem wo nt be solve .",
    "now we want to consider a situation in which distinct vacua are casually connected beyond their horizons .",
    "this connection might be rooted in entanglement or a weakly coupled field which would be correlated on super - horizon scales at the end of inflation ( @xcite and references in them ) or because of quantum and thermal tunneling ( fig .",
    "( [ fig.8 ] ) ) . the tunneling rate from false to true vacuum",
    "is given by @xcite :    @xmath54    here @xmath55 is the euclidean action of the field configuration that leads to tunneling and can be calculated via wkb generalization of field theory .",
    "we can also calculate @xmath16 using the path integral approach @xcite .",
    "so as we see in fig .",
    "( [ fig.9 ] ) , there exists a possibility for the domains of @xmath0 vacua in nmssm electroweak symmetry breaking to be casually connected beyond their horizons to their nearest neighbors .",
    "now we can see better why it was claimed that an expanding universe filled with regions of @xmath0 vacua and domain walls created during the nmssm electroweak symmetry breaking , belongs to the same universality class of a @xmath12 three states diluted potts model .",
    "cosmological domain walls here play the same role as equivalent domain clusters walls in the diluted potts model do . as long as each vacuum region",
    "could be connected to its nearest neighbors beyond its horizon , the universe expansion wo nt be problematic for the universality considerations .",
    "being in the same universality class , we can use the results and behaviors of the diluted potts system near its tri - critical point , in order to study the behavior of the early universe filled with @xmath0 vacua .",
    "moreover , there must be a tri - critical point in the chronology of early universe during the nmssm electroweak symmetry breaking / phase transition which we are going to study in more details .",
    "there exists two different stages in the evolution of the universe :    first , the domain walls thickness is @xmath56 which corresponds to @xmath57 in the diluted potts model with equivalent thickness @xmath13 . in this case",
    "the universe might be trapped in a metastable state and inflates ( fig .",
    "( [ fig.10 ] ) ) . due to",
    "the fact that percolation threshold is less than the distribution probability @xmath58 there would exists a non - degenerated vacuum .",
    "similar to the completely disconnected case , if @xmath59 the walls decay exponentially fast and vanish , which helps the universe to exit out of the inflationary state ( fig .",
    "( [ fig.10].b ) ) .",
    "second stage would happens if @xmath60 in which the domain walls do not decay . in this case , according to zeldovic _ et al .",
    "@xcite the early universe would experiences an expansion due to energy density of the walls which might become dangerous if their growth lasts for a long time . but based on the results of diluted potts model , and the fact of being in the same universality class , near the cosmological tri - critical point @xmath61 that corresponds to @xmath62 in the diluted potts model .",
    "this means that the cosmological walls expansion should be ceased as the universe approaches tri - critical point .",
    "we can interpret this by the fact that near the tri - critical point , total cluster surfaces is fractal and diverges , so we have    @xmath63    there is another reason for zero domain wall thickness presented in subsection ( [ sec.4.3 ] ) . in the next three subsections",
    ", we want to study the physical consequences of correlation length divergence , zero surface tension , and fluctuations of all length scales near the tri - critical point .",
    "a universe randomly filled with three different @xmath0 vacua is completely inhomogeneous . in this subsection , we want to use the idea of casually connected neighbors to see how nmssm electroweak symmetry breaking horizon problem could be solved .",
    "( [ fig.11 ] ) shows two completely disconnected and different @xmath0 vacua at different parts of the universe .",
    "no matter how far they are , these two domains could have casual connection with each other at the tri - critical point .",
    "the only constraint here is that these @xmath0 vacua can be casually connected to their nearest neighbors beyond their horizon .    in order to see how divergence of correlation length can solve the electroweak horizon problem , we consider behavior of a two spin states potts model near its critical point .",
    "we choose this example for simplicity and clarity , the results is the same for the @xmath12 three states diluted potts model and the early universe filled with @xmath0 vacua near their tri - critical point where correlation length diverges . as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig.12 ] ) , blue and white sites represent two spin states ( up and down ) in the spin system . at high temperatures ,",
    "there are equal number of blue and white sites ( zero magnetization ) that according to the potts hamiltonian can only have casual connection with their nearest neighbors ( fig .",
    "( [ fig.12].a ) ) .",
    "when temperature decreases , near the critical point up - down symmetry breaks spontaneously and suddenly a huge spanning domain cluster emerges that connects the different edges of the system ( fig .",
    "( [ fig.12].b ) ) ( for clarity this huge cluster is represented by red color ) . at this point due to the divergence of correlation length , the two previously disconnected sites at different parts of the system / universe in fig .",
    "( [ fig.11 ] ) are now in the same huge cluster with identical properties and a casual connection . when temperature decreases more this spin cluster completely occupies the entire system ( fig .",
    "( [ fig.12].c ) ) and the result would be a homogeneous system .",
    "this is just like what happens in the @xmath12 three states diluted potts model ( fig.([fig.4 ] ) ) and the universe filled with @xmath0 vacua which are connected via a weakly coupled field . for these systems ,",
    "near the tri - critical point correlation length diverges and there would exists a huge spanning and dominant domain cluster that completely occupies the entire system / universe after the phase transition .    with this mechanism",
    "we can avoid the nmssm electroweak horizon problem and explain the homogeneity of universe ( one dominant @xmath0 vacuum rather that three ) at the end of electroweak epoch . in this scenario , casually disconnected patches of the early universe at different parts that are completely far from each other can be aware of themselves at the tri - critical point .",
    "so as we see , the simple hypothesis of a weakly coupled field that locally connects the nearest neighbors leads to a global casual connection at the tri - critical point .",
    "the surface tension or surface energy density of a @xmath12 three states diluted potts model near a tri - critical point approaches zero @xcite . in section ( [ sec.2 ] )",
    ", we interpreted this as a consequence of fractal cluster surfaces which leads to the divergence of surface area of all clusters and zero equivalent thickness @xmath64 . according to be in the same universality class ,",
    "the surface tension of the cosmological domain walls must approaches zero at its tri - critical point too .    for a cosmological domain wall",
    ", zero surface tension means no repulsive gravitational field @xcite . near this point according to eq .",
    "( [ eq.12 ] ) the pressure term dominates the tension and cosmological domain walls should decay exponentially fast . moreover , for the surface tension @xmath46 we have    @xmath65    here @xmath66 is vacuum energy density and @xmath67 is the wall thickness .",
    "as we see , zero surface tension leads to zero thickness of domain walls , which again can be interpreted as a direct consequence of the fractal nature of cosmological cluster surfaces near the tri - critical point .",
    "fractal surfaces of these high energy domain walls are extraordinary unsmooth and unfavorable .",
    "so locally at each point , the wall uses its internal energy to minimize its surface area . as it is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig.14 ] ) , near a tri - critical point some interesting things happen :    no matter prior to the tri - critical point we have inflation or not , there is a huge amount of energy release at constant temperature at this point due to the divergence of heat capacity which might be used in the baryogenesis mechanism . for temperatures higher than tri - critical point",
    "the heat capacity is zero which indicates an adiabatic process , so prior to this point we have adiabatic fluctuations . near the tri - critical point due to",
    "the divergence of correlation length there would exist adiabatic fluctuations with different length scales from zero to the size of universe .",
    "one of the most interesting features of the tri - critical point is an entropy decrease after the phase transition .",
    "this might explains the initial low entropy condition of the early universe @xcite .",
    "domain walls can also sweep the gut monopoles and vanish them completely ; the result would be unstable walls @xcite .      in order to dilute the abundance of thermal and non - thermal relics , the idea of a period of late - time inflation at electroweak energy scale or lower , has been suggested in @xcite .",
    "this late - time inflation would be problematic for primordial density fluctuations produced by ordinary gut inflation .",
    "there are two different approaches toward this problem :    first @xcite , it is believed that a weak scale inflation ca nt give rises to cosmological density perturbation of the magnitude required for large scale structure formation . in this scenario , for the late - time inflation to not erase the primordial fluctuations , the number of e - folding must be sufficiently small @xmath68 , therefore primordial density perturbations could be preserved on large scales .",
    "second @xcite , there are some supersymmetric inflationary model , based on new space dimensions or allowing more than one field relevant for inflation , in which acceptable density perturbation required for large scale structure can be generated . whether an nmssm electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism disturb the fluctuations of gut inflation or not , the scenario presented in this paper can solve the problem by considering the fact that near the tri - critical point there are adiabatic fluctuations of all length scales in the universe which can be responsible for the further cosmological structure formations .",
    "the mechanism presented in this paper is in accordance with the standard cosmology , i.e. the nmssm electroweak epoch comes after the ordinary inflation ( fig .",
    "( [ fig.15 ] ) . along with this standard framework , there are some cosmologist who place the electroweak epoch together with ordinary inflation after the gut epoch @xcite . also , recently there have been some attempts to study inflation , as a direct consequence of the nmssm mechanism @xcite . based on our results in this paper , we suggest that the ordinary inflation itself might be a consequence of nmssm electroweak symmetry breaking / phase transition , from the tri - critical point of view",
    ".    there exists a difficulty to accomplish this task : in order to make a connection between the potts model and the early universe filled with @xmath0 vacua created during the nmssm electroweak symmetry breaking , we assumed that there exists a casual connection between the nearest vacua beyond their horizons via a weakly coupled field which is rooted in a prior inflationary epoch @xcite .",
    "if we want the ordinary inflation to be a consequence of the nmssm electroweak symmetry breaking / phase transition , then we must found a mechanism to casually connects the different @xmath0 vacua beyond their horizons . if this condition is met then :        in order to solve the flatness problem , a trapped universe in the metastable state prior to the tri - critical point , supercools and experiences an inflationary state",
    "this idea resembles the old inflation scenario @xcite , but here the difference is that it has a graceful exit due to approaching the tri - critical point , or walls decay before reaching this point . the huge amount of energy release at the tri - critical point can be responsible for the ordinary reheating process .    in order to solve the horizon problem , as we see in previous subsections , we have percolation mechanism and existence of a spanning huge cluster at the tri - critical point which connects different parts of the universe .",
    "the advantage of this mechanism is that unlike the other solutions to the horizon problem , this mechanism does nt lead to a multiverse scenario .    in order to obtain the proper density fluctuation needed for further structure formation , along with the fact that primordial quantum fluctuations can be enlarged up to cosmic scales while the universe is trapped in a pre tri - critical metastable state , there exist adiabatic fluctuations at the tri - critical point with different length scales from zero to infinity which leads to further structure formations .    in order to solve the gut monopoles problem , along with an inflation due to the metastable state",
    ", domain walls can sweep them too @xcite .",
    "in this section , we want to study the thickness of domain walls created during the @xmath0 center symmetry breaking in a pure su(3 ) theory and its application in early cosmology .",
    "we will see that there might exists a tri - critical point at @xmath1 mev in the evolution of early universe which is different from the nmssm tri - critical point at @xmath1 gev .",
    "when a discrete symmetry is spontaneously broken , different phases exist that are distinguished by some order parameter .",
    "different regions of space are in different phases .",
    "as we said in the previous sections these regions are separated by domain walls with their free energy proportional to surface area .",
    "when we neglect quarks as in quenched ( static quarks ) approximation of qcd , the @xmath0 center symmetry of su(3 ) gauge group play a crucial rule .",

    "these three values construct center domains which play a crucial rule in describing the properties of strongly interacting quark gluon plasma ( sqgp ) produced in rhic and lhc such as near perfect fluidity and strong jet quenching @xcite .",
    "if we apply c - j conjecture to center domains , the result would be a pseudo - inflation . by pseudo we mean without an inflationary era ( exponential increase of scale factor @xmath76 ) , there would be an energy release together with subsequent injected entropy that can dilute the abundance of thermal and non - thermal relics of earlier times @xcite .",
    "for further procedure we need to combine c - j with y - s conjecture .",
    "according to y - s conjecture a @xmath77 dimensional pure gauge theory undergoing a continuous deconfinement transition is in the same universality class as a @xmath78-dimensional statistical model with order parameter taking values in the center of the gauge group @xcite , i.e. in order to study the @xmath0 center symmetry breaking and phase transition of a pure su(3 ) theory in four dimensions we have to look at a three dimensional three states potts model .",
