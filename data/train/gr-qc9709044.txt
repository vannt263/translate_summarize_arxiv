    "the knowledge of the nature of the matter perturbations in the observed universe is crucial for obtaining information about the very early universe and the very high energy physics .",
    "the deepest presently available window to the early universe is the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , that in the next decade will be deeply investigated by the map and planck missions , after the discovery of its anisotropies by cobe @xcite .",
    "however , the cosmic gravitational background ( cgb ) will play a crucial role in the next future as the most powerful tool in reconstructing primordial physics ( see @xcite for an extensive overview ) .",
    "infact , it consists of the gravitational waves ( gw ) generated during the inflationary era ; they are carriers of unperturbed physical traces of the very primordial history of the universe , since the gw decoupling probably occurred about 70 @xmath1foldings before the recombination !    the study of the perturbations and defects produced during inflation underwent recently a great revival ; it is motivated by the evidence of strong inhomogeneities from the direct reconstruction of the three dimensional matter distribution traced by galaxies and their peculiar velocities in the modern redshift surveys .",
    "the most important conclusions of these observations are that strong underdensities , or voids , appear very prominent in the data @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . in search for the inflationary generation mechanisms for such inhomogeneities ,",
    "one of the most interesting ideas introduced in cosmology in recent years is the possibility of performing a phase transition _ during _ inflation . in such scenarios ,",
    "two fields act on stage : one , say @xmath3 , slow rolls , driving enough inflation to solve the standard problems ; the second field , say @xmath4 , tunnels from a false vacuum state to an energetically favoured true vacuum state , producing bubbles of the new phase embedded in the old one .",
    "both processes are governed by a two - field potential @xmath5 . to avoid the graceful exit problem",
    ", the true vacuum state has to allow for a period of inflation on its own .",
    "we can then speak of a true vacuum channel over which the bubbles slow roll until inflation ends , and reheating takes place . depending on the potential , we can distinguish two different scenarios of first order inflation .",
    "the first is the classical extended inflation @xcite : the bubbles are produced in a copious quantity , so that they eventually fill the space and complete the transition . to avoid too large distortions on the cmb",
    ", this scenario must produce very small bubbles @xcite , so that they are rapidly thermalized after inflation .",
    "no trace of the bubbles is left in our universe , and from this point of view such scenarios do not lead to new predictions over inflation without bubble production . in the second scenario , proposed in @xcite and implemented in @xcite , the phase transition",
    "is completed _ before _ the end of inflation ; the amount of @xmath6-foldings between the phase transition and the end of inflation makes the scale of the bubbly perturbations interestingly non - vanishing , and allows them to leave observable traces . in particular , if a phase transition occurred sufficientely early , the bubbles are streched to cosmological scales , and the present large scale structure is therefore strictly linked to the primordial originating transition , which is therefore observable and testable as firstly suggested in @xcite .    in this work",
    "we concentrate upon the traces of the above phaenomenology on the cgb .",
    "the most natural way for the nucleated bubbles to generate gravitational waves is through collision with each other ; compared with the ordinary tensor perturbations occurring in slow rolling inflation , this is infact a very potent source of primordial gw , as firstly argued in @xcite .",
    "the problem was analysed in the context of the ordinary extended inflation , in which the bubbles are completely empty and the phase transition occurs at the end of inflation .",
    "the computation of the amplitude and frequency spectrum of the gravitational radiation was performed firstly in the case of two bubbles @xcite and then by considering an envelope of hundreds of bubbles @xcite , that substantially confirmed the previous results ; a work emphasising the observation possibilities can be found in @xcite .",
    "finally in @xcite the problem of gravitational waves from lower energy first order phase transition ( like the electro - weak transition occurring nearly at 100 gev ) was considered .    here",
    "we want to extend these results to the second kind of inflationary phase transitions mentioned above ; the main differences from the treated cases are that @xmath7 ) the nucleation epoch occurs before the end of inflation , and @xmath8 ) generally the bubble are not empty .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we recall the main results on the gravitational radiation emitted during the first order phase transition in the scenario of extended inflation , pointing out the approximations for which the computations and the results are valid ; in section iii we extend these results to recently proposed inflationary models capable of performing a first order phase transition before the end of inflation and we discuss the observation possibilities and the existing constraints ; finally , section iv contains the conclusions .",
    "a detailed analysis of a first order phase transition in the context of extended inflation can be found in @xcite .",
    "the field @xmath4 that undergoes the transition is the same that drives inflation , and its dynamics is assumed to be governed by a potential containing two non - degenerate minima , the true and false vacuum ( tv , fv ) .",
    "the central quantity needed to characterize the transition is the bubble nucleation rate for unit volume in the semiclassical limit @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the euclidean least action over the bounce minus the action for the external desitter spacetime solution @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath11 ( with a dimension of mass ) is of the order of the energy @xmath12 at which the phase transition occurs .",
    "values of @xmath13 a few orders of magnitude below the planck mass @xmath14 are generally assumed , in order to avoid quantum gravity effects @xcite .",
    "the transition is completed roughly when at least one bubble per unit hubble volume is nucleated , and accurate computations @xcite show that extended inflation is successful ( in the sense that bubbles percolate ) if at a time @xmath15 @xmath16 the bubbles are empty and their walls rapidly approach the light speed . depending on the intensity of the nucleation rate ,",
    "the collisions between the bubbles occur when they have comoving spatial dimension less or equal to the effective horizon @xmath17 at the transition epoch given by @xmath18 . in the context of the standard extended inflation almost all the bubbles are nucleated at the end of inflation , so that if we take @xmath19km / sec / mpc in an @xmath20 universe their comoving size is approximatively @xmath21 .",
    "such bubbles soon reenter the horizon and rapidly thermalize without leaving trace in the matter distribution .",
    "on the other hand , a very characteristic gw spectrum is produced during the transition .",
    "if the bubbles are perfectely spherical , no spacetime perturbation is seen from the outside .",
    "when two ( or more ) bubbles collide they become a gw source , and the collection of collisions during the whole phase transition leaves observationally interesting traces on the cgb @xcite .",
    "the problem of computing the emitted gw spectrum is conceptually simple but computatively difficult .",
    "one has to simulate the bubble nucleations with rate given by ( [ tunnrate ] ) and to evolve them with the klein - gordon equation .",
    "whenever collisions occur , one must compute the radiation emitted .",
    "it has been performed @xcite with the aid of two main approximations : linearized gravity and static background .",
    "the former is consistent if the fraction of energy that goes in gw is small with respect to unity ; the latter is valid if the transition completes within an hubble time .",
    "following @xcite , the total energy radiated at frequency @xmath3 in the direction @xmath22 into the solid angle @xmath23 and in the interval @xmath24 is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the projection tensor for gravitational radiation @xcite and @xmath27 the fourier transform of the energy momentum tensor .",
    "the computations were firstly performed in the simplified case of two colliding bubbles @xcite .",
    "the end of the transition in that case was modelled as a modulating function @xmath28 that makes the signal vanish after a cutoff time @xmath29 of the order of the initial separation between the bubbles .",
    "in @xcite an ingenious model for @xmath30 was introduced by excluding from the integration the spatial region where bubbles overlap ; at @xmath31 the bubbles completely fill the space , and the gw emission ends .",
    "this also allowed to perform many bubbles simulations .",
    "the results are intuitive and consistent with the approximations .",
    "firstly , the bounce is approximated as @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 sets the natural scale for the phase transition .",
    "since this is of the order of the initial average separation between the colliding bubbles , the static backgorund approximation requires that @xmath34 .",
    "the gw spectrum shows a very characteristical peak at @xmath35 and the fraction of energy radiated in gw is found @xmath36 ; @xmath37 is the critical energy density at the time @xmath15 ; @xmath38 counts the number of relativistic degrees of freedom at the temperature @xmath39 of the phase transition , and is typically of the order of 100 .",
    "we remark that these results agree with physical expectations : the peak frequancy is simply the inverse of the time scale of the process , and the @xmath40 scaling for @xmath41 can be naturally inferred in terms of the energy density @xmath42 and @xmath33 @xcite . to obtain the corresponding present quantities",
    ", one has to take into account the cosmic redshift from @xmath39 down to the present 3 k. @xmath41 remains unchanged during the radiation epoch , but undergoes a decrease during the matter dominated era ; @xmath43 redshifts via the cosmic expansion .",
    "the quantities relevant at the present are therefore @xmath44 @xmath45 where we have defined @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we emphasize once again that the above results hold for the extended inflation scenario , in which bubbles are nucleated at the end of inflation and rapidly thermalize . in the next section",
    "we will extend these results to the models of first order inflation capable to perform the nucleation epoch well before the end of inflation , showing how the above results change and discussing the consequences on the observability .",
    "recent studies on inflation @xcite have shown that a not @xmath48 slow rolling is generated by the gravitational part of the lagrangian , already at the level of fourth order gravity ( fog ) .",
    "a matter field potential containing false and true vacuum minima generates a first order phase transition , but the latter in general occurs at an epoch characterized by a number @xmath49 of @xmath1foldings before the end of inflation . depending on this quantity , the scale of the bubble - like perturbations may be stretched out to cosmological size by the exponential growth , thus candidating the bubbles to be the seeds for the formation of the voids observed today @xcite .",
    "we consider the consequences on the cgb spectrum of this fog model ( and we refer to @xcite and @xcite for an extensive treatment ) ; since a conformal transformation makes the lagrangian as in ordinary two field inflation , our results hold for any kind of inflation in which one field slow rolls and the other one undergoes a first order phase transition .",
    "once the conformal transformation is performed , the fog action takes the form @xmath50\\,,\\ ] ] where the potential is @xmath51\\,,\\ ] ] and generates tv bubbles with @xmath52 , a degenerate quartic , and @xmath53 , the symmetry breaking term .",
    "the slow roll inflation driven by @xmath3 takes place at @xmath54 , and is over when @xmath3 approaches zero . at large @xmath3 ,",
    "the potential @xmath55 is dominated by @xmath56 , and thus the false vacuum minimum at @xmath57 , for which @xmath58 $ ] is unstable with respect to tunneling towards the true vacuum @xmath59 ( for which @xmath60 ) . at small @xmath3 , instead , @xmath55 is dominated by @xmath61 , and both the true and the false vacua converge to the global zero - energy minimum at @xmath62 , where inflation ends and reheating takes place . the slow - roll solution in this model for @xmath54",
    "can be written very conveniently as @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the number of @xmath6-foldings to the end of inflation .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that taking into account the gravitational corrections and dropping the thin wall approximation due to a finite thickness @xmath65 for the wall surrounding a bubble of radius @xmath66 , the nucleation rate @xmath67 defined in ( [ tunnrate ] ) becomes @xmath68 and in terms of @xmath64 the bounce is @xmath69\\left[1-\\left({n\\over n_3 } \\right)^4\\right]\\ ] ] where the first brackets is the thin wall correction , and the second brackets is the gravitational correction ; moreover , the @xmath70 are related to the physical quantities by @xmath71    by indicating with @xmath49 the amount of @xmath1foldings to the end of inflation when the phase transition takes place , the quantity @xmath72 defined in ( [ condition ] ) takes the approximate form @xmath73\\left[1-\\left({n_0\\over n_3 } \\right)^4\\right]\\right\\}\\ \\ .\\ ] ] the two approximations that have been adopted to obtain the above formulas are satisfied by the conditions @xmath74 ( thin - wall ) , and for @xmath75 ( gravitational correction ) .",
    "also , @xmath76 is required to guarantee tunneling through tv bubbles @xcite .",
    "the central underdensity of a bubble is determined by the shape of the potential ( [ conpot ] ) at the nucleation epoch , characterizes by @xmath64 : @xmath77^{-1}\\ \\ , \\ \\",
    "n_4 ^ 2=3\\pi { \\psi_0 ^ 2 m^2\\over m^2}={64\\over 9\\pi } m^{2}n_{1}^{-4}n_{3}^{8}\\ \\ .\\ ] ]    from the current microwave background measurements , we obtain @xmath78 ( in planck units ) @xcite , a value that we will adopt in the results below .",
    "however , since in our model one should also consider the contribution of the bubbles to the microwave background , this constraint is actually only an upper limit on @xmath79 . as an intuitive feature , note that the four physical parameters @xmath80 , and therefore the four @xmath6-folding constants @xmath81 fully determine the inflationary potential at @xmath49 ( the nucleation epoch ) : the vacuum energy density , the energy difference between fv and tv , the amplitude of the barrier and the value @xmath82 of the fv phase .",
    "the linearized gravity approximation involved to obtain the results ( [ omeganow],[omegagwnow ] ) is surely satisfied in our case since the energy that goes into the walls and therefore in gw is a fraction @xmath83 given by ( [ delta ] ) of the total fv energy in the bubble .",
    "the other important approximation is to consider spacetime as static during the transition ; in other words , the time scale of the nucleation era must be smaller than the hubble time .",
    "this is satisfied in our case if the condition @xmath34 holds at @xmath49 , where @xmath84 is defined in ( [ beta ] ) ; this means @xmath85 , that using ( [ bn ] ) becomes @xmath86\\ge 1\\ \\ .\\ ] ] by defining @xmath87 the quantity in brackets in ( [ fasttrans ] ) is simply @xmath88 still taking into account the gravitational and post - thin wall corrections .",
    "the range of interest for both @xmath89 and @xmath90 is @xmath91 $ ] for consistency of our approximations .",
    "since @xmath92 does not appeare in @xmath93 , for the validity of ( [ fasttrans ] ) it is enough that @xmath93 assumes some positive value ; it is easily seen that this is true in the range @xmath94 . by choosing a value of @xmath49 and @xmath95 to fix @xmath89",
    ", a value of @xmath90 always exists that yields @xmath96 ; therefore , our model performs a fast transition for @xmath97^{1/4}\\ \\ .\\ ] ]    we can now extend the results ( [ omeganow],[omegagwnow ] ) to the present inflationary models .",
    "the peak frequency of the gw spectrum contains an @xmath98 redshift due to the inflationary expansion between the phase transition and the end of slow rolling .",
    "moreover , in calculating @xmath41 we must take into account that the fraction of energy that goes in gravitational radiation is reduced by a fraction @xmath83 , ( [ delta ] ) , with respect to ( [ omegagwnow ] ) .",
    "therefore , the results are @xmath99 @xmath100 in the following we will adopt the values @xmath101 ( fixing the epoch of the end of slow rolling at typical gut energy scales ) , and @xmath102 .    from the above formulas it is clear that in general any model of two field first order inflation radically changes the frequencies of the gw spectrum to be observed today with respect to the ordinary extended inflation models . the main difference is represented by the shift of the peak frequency towards lower values depending on the amount of @xmath1foldings between the phase transition and the end of inflation .",
    "this has very interesting consequences for what concerns the search for the present traces of the era driven by very high energy physics .",
    "we make now some general considerations about this , referring to the next two sub - sections to a detailed analysis of two important cases .    formulas ( [ gwfog1],[gwfog2 ] ) may be rewritten emphasizing the relation between the physical parameters @xmath103^{2 } } \\exp ( -2n_{0})\\ \\ , \\ ] ] with the constraint @xmath104 . in fig.1",
    "we plot experimentally interesting @xmath105 as a function of the peak frequency @xmath43 and for different @xmath49 ( the change in grey tonality corresponds to a scansion of 5 in @xmath49 , as indicated on the legend box ) ; for clearness , we have set @xmath106 ( top ) and .01 ( bottom ) .",
    "each point on the figure correspond to the gw spectrum generated by a first order phase transition occurred @xmath49 @xmath6-foldings before the end of inflation .",
    "for @xmath107 we obtain the known results in the case of extended inflation ( [ omeganow],[omegagwnow ] ) .",
    "the increase of @xmath49 pushes the peak frequency towards exponentially small values and intersects very interestingly the plotted expected level of sensitivities of the next generation of gw interferometric detectors : if first order phase transitions occurred at @xmath108 during the inflationary era ( realistically arising from spontaneous breaking of very high energy symmetries ) , they should leave next future detectable peaks in the cgb frequency spectrum . by continuing to increase @xmath49 beyond several decades",
    ", we enter in the class of phase transitions that could leave traces in the present large scale matter distribution . in particular , at @xmath109 , the remnants of the nucleated bubbles are of astrophysically interesting size , and correspond to the large voids detected in the galaxy distribution @xcite @xcite . for such models ,",
    "the gw frequencies correspond to cosmological wavelenghts , to be interestingly investigated through their induced cmb anisotropies ; as we will show in the sequel , a deep insight already comes from considering the anisotropy amplitude ; however it is interesting to point out that in the future these models could be tested with powerful methods ( presently under investigation ) capable to extract the pure cgb signal from the data coming from the next high resolution cmb experiments @xcite .    in the following we consider in more detail the correspondence between the cgb and the parameters of the effective lagrangian , focusing on two important cases : spectra detectable by the next ligo interferometric detectors , and spectra from colliding bubbles of astrophysically interesting size .",
    "the advanced ligo project will reach a sensibility of about @xmath110 in the frequency range @xmath111 hz ( see @xcite and references therein ) . from ( [ gwfog1],[gwfog2 ] )",
    ", we see that the amplitude and the peak frequency fix the products @xmath112 and @xmath113 , namely two conditions for our physical parameters . then , by fixing @xmath114 so to yield a reasonable parametric region for @xmath115 ( we remember that @xmath116 ) , we may search for the physical parameter set that could explain the observation of a definite peak at some frequency in the above ranges . such set",
    "is constrained by ( [ gwfog1 ] ) , @xmath117^{1\\over 4}\\le n_{1}\\le \\left[{3\\cdot 10^{7}\\over \\omega_{min}}4n_{0}^{3 } z(x , y)e^{-n_{0}}\\right]^{1\\over 4}\\ \\ , \\ ] ] to have the peak frequency in the observation range , and by ( [ gwfog2 ] ) , @xmath118^{1\\over 4}\\ \\ , \\ ] ] to have a sufficient amplitude .",
    "moreover ( [ fasttrans2 ] ) ( with @xmath96 of course ) must be satisfied to have the completion of the transition in less than an hubble time and @xmath119 to have nucleation of tv bubbles .",
    "the dashed areas in fig.2 are the regions of the parameters @xmath120 for which both the peak frequency and the amplitude fall into the observation ranges ; the upper panel shows the limit in which the post - thin wall and gravitational corrections are negligible , while in the lower panel such corrections are important .",
    "the constraints define the region of observability shaded in fig.2 ; as an interesting and intuitive feature we note that a first order inflationary phase transition , that is ligo detectable , occurs at @xmath121 @xmath1foldings before the end of inflation , that is just the amount necessary to redshift the corrisponding frequencies in ordinary extended inflation ( @xmath122 , see ( [ omeganow ] ) and fig.1 ) towards the observation range . from to the nucleation epoch",
    "it is easily found that the comoving size of these perturbations is approximatively @xmath123 ; this means that they reenter the horizon early in the radiation dominated era and most likely do not leave traces in the density field .",
    "finally we remark once again that for each set of @xmath81 there exists a set of physical parameters @xmath124 , as it is easily seen from ( [ tunnrate2],[bn ] , [ n],[q ] ) .",
    "as we already mentioned in the introduction , the recent analysis on the modern redshift surveys have assessed the large scale voids as the dominant feature of the nearby universe .",
    "several works have been performed in these years on the hypothesis that the primordial origin of the voids is in an inflationary phase transition in the context of models of fog and in general two field inflation @xcite . here",
    "we add a new tool .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that voids of tens of mpc of diameter would be the relics of bubbles with comoving size expanded by a factor @xmath125 between the phase transition and the end of inflation .",
    "this request fixes the product @xmath126 and by requiring @xmath127 we have @xmath109 .",
    "the frequency in ( [ gwfog1 ] ) is therefore : @xmath128 on these frequencies there is the most stringent presently available constraint upon the amplitude of the cgb , provided by the amount of anisotropy of the cmb ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "precisely , this constraint imposes that @xmath129 and consequentely our frequencies localize themselves on the high frequency border of this range , where @xmath130 ( @xmath19 km / sec / mpc ) .",
    "note that the corrisponding wavelenghts determine cmb anisotropies on small angular scales ( @xmath131 ) , that will be deeply investigated by the map and planck missions of the next decade , as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "a great effort is being done in order to develope theoretical analysis instruments capable to extract the pure cgb signal from the whole spectrum of cmb anisotropies , both for what concerns pure @xmath132 and polarization ( see e.g. @xcite ) ; this matter will provide a powerful tool to investigate the whole cgb spectrum , and in particular the traces of early inflationary phase transitions , that are the subject here .",
    "here we concentrate on the overall amplitude constraint given by ( [ allen ] ) , since it already provides a deep insight into the physical parameter space ; from ( [ delta],[gwfog2 ] ) we see that it must be @xmath133 or , alternatively to ( [ l0 ] ) , @xmath134^{1\\over 4}\\ \\ ; \\ ] ] this sets a very narrow range ( at fixed @xmath135 and @xmath136 ) for @xmath49 and @xmath92 .",
    "moreover , another condition arises from ( [ delta ] ) for the minimal @xmath137 capable to yield the voids observed today @xcite @xmath138 in fig.3 we plot again all the constraints for @xmath139 ( upper panel , negligible post - thin wall and gravitational corrections ) and @xmath140 ( lower panel ) . in both panels",
    ", each curve refers to the indicated constraint : the solid line represents the condition ( [ g ] ) , and guarantees that the bubbles are expanded to the observed sizes .",
    "the short dashed line draws the condition ( [ void4 ] ) .",
    "finally , the long dashed line represents the strong constraint coming from the cmb ( [ void2],[void3 ] ) .",
    "the part of solid line below all the curves satisfies all the constraints , and restricts to @xmath141 the epoch of the phase transition ; also , the gravitational and post - thin wall corrections ( important in the lower panel ) allow for a viable parameter set slightly larger than when they are negligible ( upper panel ) .",
    "for physical parameters on the allowed set , the presently large scale observed voids correspond , both for size and underdensity , to the tv bubbles nucleated during inflation , without exceeding the constraints coming from the cmb isotropy .",
    "we have extended the known results on the stochastic gravitational background produced by colliding bubbles in two fields models of first order inflation . in such models ,",
    "a field performs the first order phase transition and a second field ( that in fourth order gravity is of gravitational origin ) provides the inflationary slow rolling .",
    "the resulting general phaenomenology is that the phase transition occurs well before the end of inflation .",
    "this has very non - trivial consequences on the gravitational radiation produced by colliding bubbles .",
    "it is found that the expansion between the phase transition and the end of inflation cause an additional redshift for the peak frequency of the spectrum with respect to the ordinary models of extended inflation ; also , the energy carried by the gravitational waves is reduced by a fraction equal to the density contrast of the ( not completely empty ) bubbles .",
    "the result is that if first order phase transitions occurred during the inflationary era ( realistically arising from spontaneous breaking of very high energy symmetries ) , they should leave next future detectable peaks in the cgb frequency spectrum .",
    "that detection would be a first experimental verification of our very high energy physics theoretical investigations .",
    "in particular , a peak at some frequency explored by the next ligo interferometers may be explained in terms of a first order phase transition occurred typically 10@xmath020 @xmath1foldings before the reheating at gut energy scales ( @xmath142 gev ) .",
    "moreover , the gravitational radiation produced in recently proposed models capable of generating the observed large scale voids , has been examined . in these models ,",
    "the phase transition occurs more than 50 @xmath1foldings before the end of inflation .",
    "as expected , the typical frequencies of the spectrum are in the range in which the isotropy of the cmb puts the strongest existing constraint on the amplitude of the gravitational background , and gives a very deep insight into the physical parameter space .",
    "we find a precise new relation among the physical parameters in the class of the models in which the phase transition is fast ( namely less than an hubble time ) ; the cmb constraint requires that the phase transition occurs generally more than 55 @xmath1foldings before the end of inflation .",
    "these results localize the parameter set of the effective lagrangian for which the present large scale observed voids correspond , both in size and underdensity , to the tv bubbles nucleated during the inflationary era , without perturbing the cmb .",
    "the fraction of cmb anisotropies and polarization due to phaenomena investigated here could be recognized in the high resolution cmb data that will be provided by the experiments of the next decade .",
