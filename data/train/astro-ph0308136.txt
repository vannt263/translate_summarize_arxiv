    "one of the most interesting recent developments in the study of supernovae ( sne ) is the discovery of some very energetic supernovae , whose kinetic energy ( ke ) exceeds @xmath3erg , about 10 times the ke of normal core - collapse sne ( hereafter @xmath4erg ) .",
    "the most luminous and powerful of these objects , the type ic supernova ( sn  ic ) 1998bw , was probably linked to the gamma - ray burst grb 980425 ( galama et al .",
    "1998 ) , thus establishing for the first time a connection between gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and the well - studied phenomenon of core - collapse sne .",
    "however , sn  1998bw was exceptional for a sn  ic : it was as luminous at peak as a sn  ia , indicating that it synthesized @xmath5 @xmath2  of @xmath0ni , and its ke was estimated at @xmath6 erg ( iwamoto et al .",
    "1998 ; woosley , eastman , & schmidt 1999 ) .",
    "because of its large ke , sn  1998bw was called a  hypernova ( hn ) \" .    subsequently , other",
    " hypernovae \" of type ic have been discovered or recognised , such as sn  1997ef ( iwamoto et al .",
    "2000 ; mazzali , iwamoto & nomoto 2000 ) , sn  1997dq ( matheson et al .",
    "2001 ) , sn  1999as ( knop et al . 1999 ) , and sn  2002ap ( mazzali et al .",
    "although these sne ic did not appear to be associated with grbs , most recent `` hypernova '' sn 2003dh is clearly associated with grb 030329 ( stanek et al .",
    "2003 ; hjorth et al . 2003 ; kawabata et al .",
    "figures [ eps1 ] and [ eps2 ] show the near - maximum spectra and the absolute v - light curves of these hypernovae .",
    "these objects span a wide range of properties , although they all appear to be highly energetic compared to normal core - collapse sne .",
    "sn 1999as is the most luminous supernova ever discovered , reaching a peak magnitude @xmath7 , while the brightness of sn 2002ap appears to be similar to that of normal core collapse sne .",
    "the analysis of these various objects suggests that the ke may be related to the progenitor s main - sequence mass , which was probably @xmath8 @xmath2  for sn  1999as , @xmath9 @xmath2  for sn  1998bw , @xmath10 @xmath2for sn  1997ef , and @xmath11 @xmath2  for sn  2002ap .",
    "another possible hypernovae , although of type iin , were sn  1997cy and 1999e , which was also estimated to have a large mass ( @xmath12 @xmath2 ; germany et al .",
    "2000 ; turatto et al .",
    "2000 ; rigon et al .",
    "these mass estimates place hypernovae at the high - mass end of sn progenitors , as they are always larger than the mass of the progenitors of normal core - collapse sne , which is @xmath13 @xmath2 .    in the following sections , we examine the properties of these hypernovae as derived from optical light curves and spectra and discuss what may be the discriminating factor for the birth of a hypernova or the connection with a grb .",
    "we then focus on nucleosynthesis in hypernovae , which is quite distinct from the case of ordinary supernovae , thus making a unique contribution to galactic chemical evolution .",
    "-band light curves of sne 1998bw ( _ open circles _ ) , 1997ef ( _ open triangles _ ) , 2002ap ( _ stars _ ) , and 1994i ( _ filled circles _ ) ( mazzali et al . 2002 ) . ]",
    "in the early spectra of sn 1998bw , only few features were present .",
    "absorption features were very broad , if present at all , while broad peaks were present at 4000 , 5,000 , 6,000 and 8,000 (galama et al .",
    "the absence of any hydrogen lines , of any clear he i features , and of a strong si ii 6355 line indicated that sn1998bw should be classified as a type ic sn , despite some deviation from previously known objects of this class , mostly due to the extreme line width .",
    "sne ic are thought to be the result of core - collapse - induced explosions of c+o stars , which are massive stars that have lost their h - rich envelope and almost all of their he shell , through either a wind or binary interaction ( nomoto et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "sn 1998bw is located in a spiral arm of the barred spiral galaxy eso 184-g82 , for which a distance is measured as @xmath14 mpc from its redshift velocity 2550 km s@xmath15 ( galama et al . 1998 ) and a hubble constant @xmath16 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 .",
    "then , the peak absolute luminosity is estimated to be @xmath17 ergs sec@xmath15 , which is about ten times brighter than typical core - collapse sne ( sne ib / ic , or ii ) . assuming that the grb was at the same distance as sn  1998bw , the gamma - ray fluence of grb980425 reported by the batse ( cgro ) group , @xmath18 erg @xmath19 ( kippen et al .",
    "1998 ) , corresponds to a burst energy @xmath20 ergs ( in gamma - rays ) .",
    "this is four orders of magnitude smaller than for average grbs , implying that either grb980425 might not be a typical burst or that it may not be related to sn 1998bw .",
    "however , the recent case of grb030329/sn2003dh has provided a solid evidence of connection between the ordinary grbs and hypernovae ( stanek et al .",
    "2003 ; hjorth et al . 2003 ; kawabata et al .",
    "wang & wheeler ( 1998 ) studied the correlation between sne and grbs in the literature systematically .",
    "extensive follow - up observations of sn  1998bw have brought us invaluable information on this peculiar sn and put rather strong constraints on corresponding theoretical models .",
    "the early light curve of sn 1998bw has been modeled based on spherically symmetric explosions .",
    "various investigations reached the similar conclusion that the early light curve can be successfully reproduced by the explosion of a massive c+o star with a kinetic energy more than ten times larger than a canonical sn explosion ( iwamoto et al .",
    "1998 ; woolsey et al .",
    "figure [ eps5 ] compares the light curve of sn 1998bw with those of other sne ic and their model light curves ( table 1 ) .",
    "sn 1998bw showed a very early rise .",
    "it had a luminosity of @xmath21 erg s@xmath15 already at day 1 .",
    "this rapid rise requires the presence of @xmath0ni near the surface .",
    "since spherically symmetric explosion models produce @xmath0ni in deep inner layers of the ejecta , they can only reproduce this behaviour if extensive mixing is postulated to have occurred , dredging @xmath0ni up to outer layers ( iwamoto et al . 1998 ; nakamura et al . 2001a ) .",
    "the light curve of sn 1998bw reaches the peak on about day 16 , with the peak absolute magnitude being comparable to that of normal sne ia .",
    "we obtain a qualitative guess of model parameters such as ejecta mass @xmath22 , explosion kinetic energy @xmath23 erg , and the @xmath0ni mass @xmath24 by employing an analytic solution by arnett ( 1982 ) . at early times , the bolometric luminosity @xmath25 of a `` compact '' sn that is powered by radioactive decay of @xmath0ni is written as    @xmath26    where @xmath27 days and @xmath28 erg g@xmath15 are the decay time of @xmath0ni and the energy deposited per gram of @xmath0ni , respectively , and the function @xmath29 is given by    @xmath30    it is assumed that @xmath0ni is distributed homogeneously and that @xmath31-rays are all trapped in the ejecta .",
    "this latter assumption is correct at the early phases we are considering .",

    "the variable @xmath38 is defined as @xmath39 . for the principal mode of diffusion (",
    "arnett 1982 ; pinto & eastman 2000 ) , @xmath34 turns out to be    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the effective opacity .",
    "hereafter , the symbol @xmath42 denotes @xmath43 .",
    "the ejecta are assumed to be a sphere of constant density expanding homologously , and thus @xmath22 and @xmath44 erg are given by @xmath45 , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 are the radius , density , and surface velocity of the ejecta , respectively .",

    "co138e1 is an ordinary sn ic model , in which a c+o star of @xmath50 ( which is the core of a @xmath51 main - sequence star ) explodes with @xmath52 ergs and @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54 (= 2 @xmath2 in this case ) denotes the mass cut , which corresponds to the mass of the compact star remnant , either a neutron star or a black hole .",
    "co138e50 , co138e30 , and co138e7 are hypernova models , in which the progenitor c+o star is the same as co138e1 but explodes with different energies .",
    "the mass cut is chosen so that the ejected mass of @xmath0ni is the value required to explain the observed peak brightness of sn  1998bw . [ cols= \" < ,",

    ". we can put further constraint on the typical mass of pop iii .",
    "the abundances of all observed emp stars including the most metal - poor one are inconsistent with the abundance pattern of pair - instability supernovae ( pisne ) . for typical emp stars and cs22948 - 037 , enrichment by pisne can not be consistent with the observed abundant zn / fe and co / fe ratios ( umeda & nomoto 2002 ; heger & woosley 2002 ) .",
    "for he0107 - 5240 and other c - rich emp stars , pisne enrichment is difficult to account for the large c / mg ratios .",
    "therefore the supernova progenitors that are responsible for the formation of emp stars are in the range of @xmath55 @xmath2 , but not more massive than 130 @xmath2 .",
    "this upper limit depends on the stability of massive stars as will be discussed below .      to determine the upper limit mass of the zero age main sequence ( zams ) , we analyze a linear non - adiabatic stability of massive ( @xmath56 - @xmath57 ) pop iii stars using a radial pulsation code ( nomoto et al .",
    "because cno elements are absent during the early stage of their evolution , the cno cycle does not operate and the star contracts until temperature rises sufficiently high for the @xmath58 reaction to produce @xmath59c .",
    "we calculate that these stars have @xmath60 , and the central temperature @xmath61 on their zams .",
    "we also examine the models of pop i stars for comparison .",
    "table  [ tab : pop3 ] shows the results for our analysis .",
    "the critical mass of zams pop iii star is @xmath62 while that of pop i star is @xmath63 .",
    "this difference comes from very compact structures ( with high @xmath64 ) of pop iii stars .",
    "stars more massive than the critical mass will undergo pulsation and mass loss .",
    "we note that the @xmath65-folding time of instability is much longer for pop iii stars than pop i stars with the same mass , and thus the mass loss rate is much lower .",
    "these results are consistent with ibrahim , boury , & noels ( 1981 ) and baraffe , heger , & woosley ( 2001 ) .",
    "however , the absence of the indication of pisne may imply that these massive stars above 130 @xmath2  undergo significant mass loss , thus evolving into fe core - collapse rather than pisne .",
    "in this paper , we first describe how the basic parameters of hypernova sn  1998bw are derived from observations and modeling , and discuss the properties of other hypernovae individually .",
    "these hypernovae seem to come from rather massive stars , being more massive than @xmath1 20 - 25 @xmath2  on the main - sequence , thus forming black holes . on the other hand ,",
    "there are some examples of massive sne with only a small kinetic energy .",
    "we suggest that stars with non - rotating black holes are likely to collapse `` quietly '' ejecting a small amount of heavy elements ( faint supernovae ) .",
    "in contrast , stars with rotating black holes are likely to give rise to very energetic supernovae ( hypernovae ) .",
    "we present distinct nucleosynthesis features of these two types of `` black - hole - forming '' supernovae .",
