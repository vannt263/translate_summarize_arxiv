    "since the discovery of ultra - compact dwarf galaxies ( ucds ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , it is still a complicated puzzle in extragalactic astronomy how such compact and luminous objects may have formed .",
    "they are brighter and larger than globular clusters ( gcs ) @xcite and much smaller than early - type dwarf galaxies ( des ) in both size and luminosity .",
    "a number of studies targeting various ucd samples in different galaxy clusters also revealed the diverse nature of ucds : fornax ucds are slightly redder on average than virgo ucds @xcite . on the other hand , it is still a matter of debate whether or not the ucds contain dark matter @xcite .",
    "this makes them very special objects to study in extragalactic astronomy , suggesting that the presence of dark matter or not can be directly related to whether ucds have a galactic origin or not .",
    "overall it has been already noted that virgo ucds contain fairly old ( age : @xmath0 8 - 10 gyr ) and metal poor ( @xmath10.5 dex ) stellar populations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter e07 ) . therefore , it is also proposed that they could be very luminous intra - cluster gcs @xcite .",
    "another popular formation scenario is the threshing of nucleated des @xcite . in this picture ,",
    "ucds are the remnants of galaxies that have been significantly stripped in the cluster environment .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite have generally confirmed that the remnant nuclei resemble ucds in their structural parameters .",
    "stellar population studies of des provide evidence that the nuclei have intermediate ages and moderately metal - enriched stellar populations @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , since ucds show slightly super solar [ @xmath2/fe ] abundances , @xcite argued that the stellar population properties rather support the view that ucds are luminous globular clusters than being nuclei of des .    in this letter , we present a stellar population analysis based on absorption - line strengths ( lick indices , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) of a fairly large sample of 34 nucleated des and 10 ucds in the virgo cluster .",
    "so far , studies comparing stellar population parameters derived from spectra used rather low numbers of objects .",
    "moreover , the extraction of nuclear spectra has been made without subtracting the underlying galactic light , which can still contribute significantly at the photometric center of the des .",
    "we therefore apply a simple method to subtract most of this light ( see section [ reduc ] ) , thus expecting that our measurements are representative for the stellar population properties of the nuclei themselves",
    ". finally , we present the distributions of the stellar population parameters of de nuclei and ucds with respect to local galaxy density and to their luminosity , and we try to constrain possible formation scenarios of virgo ucds .",
    "to values brighter than 21 mag , and the `` nucleus strength '' , i.e.  the value of @xmath3 to less than -1",

    "three of the nine virgo ucds of jones et al .",
    "were not included in the lick index study of evstigneeva et al .",
    "( vucd2 , 8 , and 9 ) , so they were selected by us as targets .",
    "three further ucds were selected , since they fell in the same field - of - view as de targets of our study . due to the multi - slit observations",
    ", they could be easily included .",
    "we also targeted a new virgo ucd candidate , which we now indeed confirm as virgo cluster member ; it is named vucd10 in table 1 .",
    "it was identified through a simple multiparameter selection procedure . from sdss dr5 pipeline photometry",
    ", we obtained @xmath9 magnitudes and colors for all nine virgo ucds in @xcite . when excluding vucd7 , which is clearly brighter than the others and appears to be an extended object in the sdss images ( also see @xcite ) , the _",
    "r_-band magnitudes ( sdss `` modelmag '' values ) lie within 18.0 to 19.1 mag .",
    "their petrosian radii in @xmath5 , again excluding vucd7 , are below 2.2 arcsec .",
    "their _ u - r _ colors , when excluding the much redder vucd3 , cover the range 1.8 to 2.4 mag ( which includes vucd7 ) .",
    "their _ i - z _ colors , again excluding vucd3 , lie between 0.1 and 0.25 mag ( which again includes vucd7 ) .",
    "the right ascension and declination of all objects except vucd3 and vucd7 ranges from 187.5@xmath10 to 188.1@xmath10 and 11.9@xmath10 to 12.7@xmath10 , respectively . when querying the sdss database for all objects fulfilling the above criteria of magnitude , radius , color , and position , 20 objects were identified that the sdss classified as stars , among them vucd1 , 2 , and 5 . the same query , but for objects classified as galaxies , yielded only five objects : vucd4 , 6 , 8 , 9 , and the new vucd10 , which we therefore included in our target sample .    with",
    "its radial velocity of 2425 km / s that we now measured from its spectrum , it is consistent with being a virgo cluster member : in velocity space , virgo member galaxies in the central cluster region reach velocities of 2600 km / s ( @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore consider vucd10 a new virgo cluster ucd , and include it in the following analysis .",
    "to obtain nucleus and ucd magnitudes , we use sdss dr5 @xmath5-band images to which we applied our own sky subtraction procedure ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we also correct them for galactic extinction , following @xcite , and use the flux calibration provided directly by the sdss .",
    "a virgo distance modulus of @xmath11 mag @xcite , corresponding to @xmath12 mpc and an sdss pixel scale of 32 pc ( 80 pc/ \" ) , is adopted here and in the further analysis .",
    "nucleus magnitudes are derived as follows .",
    "a srsic fit to the radial profile of the galaxy is done , measured with elliptical annuli and using only the radial interval from 2 `` to 1/3 of the half - light radius , or extending it if the interval subtends less than 2.5 '' ( 200 pc ) . from this fit , a two - dimensional elliptical model image , taking into account the median sdss psf of 1.4 \" fwhm , is created and subtracted from the original image , leaving only the nucleus in the center .",
    "the nucleus magnitude is then measured by circular aperture photometry with @xmath13 .",
    "we estimate the magnitude error to be 0.2 mag , which is consistent with the rms scatter of a comparison to the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ acs virgo cluster survey @xcite for the 10 objects in common .",
    "magnitudes were converted into @xmath14 by adding the @xmath15 color value of the nucleated de s center ( @xmath16 ) , and were then compared to acs @xmath14 magnitudes , showing no systematic offset . ]",
    "the same aperture photometry is done to obtain ucd magnitudes . to be comparable to the nucleus measurements , this aperture is also applied to vucd7 , even though it is known to be extended , as mentioned previously . for the ucd magnitudes we estimate an error of 0.1 mag .",
    "the spectroscopic observations were carried out at eso very large telescope ( vlt ) with fors2 .",
    "the 1 \" slit and v300 grism provide an instrumental resolution @xmath1711  fwhm .",
    "details of the observational layout and data reduction are described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter p10 ) .",
    "our data was obtained in two observing runs , using the same instrumental setup .",
    "the first set of des ( 26 objects , see p10 ) was observed in the semester 2007a , and the second set ( 8 des ) in 2010a . in total",
    "our sample covers the full range of local projected galaxy density that is populated by nucleated des in virgo , from less than 10 to more than 100 galaxies per square degree .",
    "the ucds were observed in 2007a together with the first set of des , using the same instrumental configuration .",
    "we provide the basic properties such as position and radial velocity in table [ ucds ] and the detailed ucd sample selection criteria in section [ scucd ] .",
    "while the nucleus typically contributes the majority of light at the photometric center of the des , still a considerable amount of underlying galactic light of the host galaxy could alter the actual properties of the nuclei .",
    "therefore , we attempt to subtract the galactic light from the nuclear spectra .",
    "this is done by inward extrapolation of the exponentially - fitted light profile of the host galaxy along the slit , yielding the amount of galaxy light contained in the nucleus extraction aperture of 0``.75 ( central 3 pixels ) .",
    "the galaxy spectrum is extracted in a radial interval from 3 '' to 8 \" , scaled accordingly , and subtracted from the centrally extracted spectrum .",
    "further details of this process are given in paudel et al .",
    "( 2010b , submitted to mnras ) .",
    "while certainly not being perfect , we expect that this approach removes most of the galactic light contamination and thus provides spectra that are fairly well representative for the stellar population properties of de nuclei .",

    "we use only h@xmath33 , mgb , fe5270 and fe5335 , because we only find these four indices available in the literature for those three ucds that we did not target ourselves .",

    "it seems that there is a weak correlation between the local projected density and the ages of the nuclei .",
    "but , more prominent than the correlation , an age break is seen at a projected density @xmath3440 sq.deg.@xmath35 .",
    "we thus use this value to divide our de sample in two groups , located in cluster regions of lower / higher density .",
    "we find median ages of 2.6 gyr for the low density group and 11.6 gyr at high densities .",
    "almost all ucds lie in the high density region as defined above .",
    "their ages have a median of 11.7 gyr , strikingly consistent with the nuclei in the same density regime . as a statistical comparison",
    ", we performed a kolmogorov - smirov ( k - s ) test with the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the distribution of ssp parameters between the ucds and the de nuclei of the high density group .",
    "we find that there is a probability of 88% , 97% and 73% for having the same age , metallicity , and [ @xmath2/fe]-abundance distribution , respectively .",
    "the metallicities of de nuclei also show a difference between the low and high density regions : the median values differ by more than 0.5 dex , although the scatter is fairly large .",
    "the ucds also have a fairly large scatter in metallicity , ranging from + 0.1 to @xmath361.4 dex .",
    "however , it is remarkable that only two ucds ( vucd3 and 4 ) have a metallicity above @xmath360.5 dex .",
    "the [ @xmath2/fe]-abundances are more or less consistent with solar in case of the de nuclei , but also a slight increase with density can be recognized for the nuclei and ( more clearly ) for the ucds .",
    "although the scatter is fairly large , the spearman s rank correlation coefficients are 0.3 and 0.7 for de nuclei and ucds , with the probabilities for the null hypothesis that there is no correlation being 8.5% and 1.5% , respectively . in case of the ucds , 7 out 10 have super - solar values of [ @xmath2/fe ] .",
    "the relation between the stellar population parameters and the @xmath5-band magnitudes of ucds and nuclei is presented in fig .",
    "we do not see a relation of age and [ @xmath2/fe]-abundance with luminosity , both for nuclei and ucds . unlike that , the metallicity of both ucds and de nuclei tends to increase with increasing luminosity , following the well known metallicity - luminosity relation .",
    "however , bimodal peaks of the age and metallicity distributions of de nuclei can be seen as a striking feature in fig  [ env ] ( right panel ) .",
    "this indicates the inhomogeneous nature of de nuclei , which can be divided into two different groups of stellar population characteristics : a young metal - rich group and an old metal - poor group .",
    "brighter nuclei predominantly have metal - rich stellar populations consistent with solar values .",
    "the metal - poor nuclei ( metallicity @xmath37 - 0.5 dex ) have an average of @xmath361.0 dex , and most of them are less luminous than @xmath38 mag ( @xmath39 mag ) .",
    "we have derived stellar population parameters of virgo cluster ucds and nuclei of early - type dwarf galaxies , through fitting measured lick absorption line strengths to models of @xcite . since we use simple stellar population models ,",
    "it must be noted that our estimated parameters are interpreted as _ ssp - equivalent .",
    "_    indications that the ucds in the virgo cluster more likely have formed via de destruction in dense cluster regions than in the fornax cluster have already been presented in the literature @xcite .",
    "an explanation could be the higher mass of the virgo cluster , which provides a deeper potential well with stronger tidal forces than in the fornax cluster .",
    "virgo ucds were also found to be significantly different from gcs in colors and sizes , as they are bluer and larger than gcs @xcite .",
    "e07 showed that virgo ucds have structural properties similar to the fornax ucds .",
    "furthermore , @xcite showed with the _ hst _ that fornax ucds are more extended and have higher surface brightnesses than typical dwarf nuclei .",
    "that is not necessarily inconsistent with the stripping scenarios , because the stripping process can alter structural parameters of the embedded nuclei .",
    "therefore , a direct comparison of structural parameters may not be able to constrain the formation scenarios of ucds properly .    in the light of our new age and metallicity estimates in the previous section ,",
    "we want to address the possibility of formation of virgo ucds via tidal destruction of nucleated des .",
    "we observe that ucds exhibit significantly older and more metal deficient stellar populations as compared to de nuclei _ on average_. however , if we compare the ages of ucds and nuclei only in high density regions , where most of the ucds are located , we do not find any significant difference in their age and metallicity distribution . only two de nuclei ( vcc0965 and vcc1122 ) out of 13 from the high density group have ages less than 5 gyr and metallicities above -0.2 dex .",
    "note , however , that due to projection effects , a number of objects that are actually located in the outskirts of the cluster must fall into regions of high _ projected _ density , lying in front or behind the center along the line of sight . if we consider the low density group of our sample to be representative for nuclei of des outside of the ( threedimensional ) cluster center , then we actually _ expect _ to have a few objects with young ages and high metallicities in the high density group , consistent with what we observe .",
    "moreover , even without taking this effect into account , our statistical tests already show that the age distributions of ucds and de nuclei are similar when considering only the group of nuclei in the high density .",
    "this supports the idea of the threshing of des in high density environments to form the ucds .    at low densities ,",
    "a certain fraction of des probably still retained some central gas and transformed it into stars ( some des are still doing this , see @xcite ) . consequently , their nuclei today would indeed show a younger stellar population than a ucd , the latter being an `` old nucleus '' .",
    "for such des , not only the orbital average should be located in the outskirts , but they should also not have passed right through the center ( e.g.  on an eccentric orbit ) , otherwise the gas would have been stripped by ram pressure and tidal forces .",
    "this would explain the fact that we do not see young ucds : a de destruction is only possible if the galaxy really goes through the center and experiences the strongest tidal forces .",
    "if we assume that the _ full _ destruction , i.e.  the complete removal of the de s main body , takes significantly more orbital time than the gas stripping , then nucleated des with an orbit leading through the center first lost their gas , halting any star formation , and then became destroyed .",
    "therefore , we have no young ucds .",
    "in any case , young and bright de nuclei have either late or prolonged star formation activity .",
    "we assess this by modeling spectra of composite stellar populations through superposition of a young and an old component , using the model spectra of @xcite .",
    "we fix the old population at an age of 11 gyr and a metallicity of -1.2 dex , and add a component with solar metallicity and exponentially declining star formation rate , starting from an age of 11 gyr .",
    "we find that spectra like those of the young nuclei ( with an ssp - equivalent age of @xmath173 gyr ) can be achieved when the exponentially declining component formed stars until 2 gyr ago , at which point it is truncated .",
    "this means , if we assume our model to represent the observed young nuclei , their star formation activity would have stopped 9 gyr later than that of the old nuclei .",
    "on the one hand , the estimated ages and metallicities of ucds nicely agree with the ages and metallicities of nuclei of des from the dense cluster regions .",
    "on the other hand , most of the old nuclei are fainter than the ucds .",
    "however , the ucd discoveries might suffer a selection effect : if a _ faint _",
    "nucleus was stripped , it would now be automatically counted into the globular cluster system of m87 .",
    "we can hardly estimate how many nucleated des have already been destroyed and transformed into ucds during the lifetime of the cluster .",
    "thus we can not rule out or confirm any scenario _ just by counting _",
    "the number of bright nuclei or that of ucds .",
