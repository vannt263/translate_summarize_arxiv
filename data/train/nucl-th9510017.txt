    "one of the clearest indication of the spin dependence of the nucleon - nucleon interaction is the fact that there exists a bound triplet deuteron , but not a singlet deuteron or dineutron .",
    "the possibility that by adding one or two more neutrons to an unbound dineutron one might wind up with a bound tri - neutron or tetra - neutron has long been discussed .",
    "however , precise experiments and calculations show no indication for the existence of such bound structures @xcite . nevertheless , the existence of resonant states of these nuclei , which have observable effects , can not be excluded .",
    "sperinde _ et al . _ found @xcite that the differential cross section of the @xmath0he(@xmath8 pion double charge exchange reaction strongly differs from what one would expect from a pure phase - space description of the final state .",
    "the discrepancy seemed to be well explained by the assumption that there exists a three - neutron resonance at 2 mev energy with 12 mev width .",
    "the authors suggested that this state is probably a member of a @xmath9 isospin quartet in the @xmath10 nuclei , another member being the three - proton state found in @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of the double charge exchange experiment was studied theoretically in @xcite .",
    "the authors found that by taking into account the final state interaction between the outgoing neutrons , one can get good agreement with the experimental results of @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of this final state interaction , whether it produces a three - neutron resonance or not , was not studied in @xcite .",
    "recently , a more thorough experimental study of the @xmath0he(@xmath8 process was performed @xcite .",
    "the authors pointed out that the analysis of @xcite was incorrect , because a four - body phase - space had been divided out of the cross section , instead of the correct three - body one . and",
    "this mistake leads to a peak in the cross section at low energies .",
    "however , three - neutron structures also appear in @xcite at small angles .",
    "these structures at @xmath11 mev three - neutron missing mass and with @xmath11 mev width could be caused by three - neutron resonances .",
    "there are experimental indications of the possible existence of resonances in other @xmath10 nuclei , too .",
    "for example , in a recent h(@xmath6he,@xmath7 ) experiment @xcite the authors concluded that in order to explain their results , an excited state of the triton has to be assumed with @xmath12 mev excitation energy and @xmath13 mev width .",
    "theoretically the problem of a three - neutron resonance was studied by glckle @xcite , who calculated the pole position of the @xmath14 matrix from the analytical continuation of the faddeev kernel for three neutrons with pure @xmath15@xmath16 @xmath17 interaction .",
    "he found that the pattern of the pole trajectory ruled out the possibility of a low - energy @xmath18 three - neutron resonance in his model .",
    "the aim of this current work is to systematically investigate the possible existence of resonances in the lowest partial waves of the three - neutron system by using the complex scaling method .",
    "we shall also comment on the triton excited state .",
    "in coordinate space , resonance eigenfunctions , corresponding to the complex energy solutions of the schrdinger equation @xmath19 show oscillatory behavior in the asymptotic region with exponentially growing amplitude , @xmath20 $ ] @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the resonance eigenfunctions are not square - integrable .",
    "the complex scaling method ( csm ) @xcite reduces the description of resonant states to that of bound states , thus avoiding the problem of asymptotics . in the csm",
    "we define a new hamiltonian by @xmath22 and solve the complex equation @xmath23 here the unbounded similarity transformation @xmath24 acts , in the coordinate space , on a function @xmath25 as @xmath26 ( if @xmath27 is real , @xmath24 means a rotation into the complex coordinate plane , if it is complex , it means a rotation and scaling . ) in the case of a many - body hamiltonian , ( [ cs ] ) means that the transformation has to be performed in each jacobi coordinate .",
    "for a broad class of potentials there is the following connection between the spectra of @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xcite : ( i ) the bound eigenstates of @xmath28 are the eigenstates of @xmath29 , for any value of @xmath27 within @xmath30 ; ( ii ) the continuous spectrum of @xmath28 will be rotated by an angle 2@xmath27 ; ( iii ) the complex generalized eigenvalues of @xmath29 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 is the full width at half maximum ) belong to its proper spectrum , with square - integrable eigenfunctions , provided @xmath34 .",
    "these complex eigenvalues coincide with the @xmath14 matrix pole positions .",
    "this method was tested for three - body resonances in @xcite , and was applied to the low - lying spectra of the @xmath6he , @xmath6li , and @xmath6be nuclei in @xcite .",
    "further details and references of the method can be found there .    up to eq .",
    "( [ schcsm ] ) our treatment of the three - body resonances is exact .",
    "the only approximation we use here is that now we expand the wave function of eq .",
    "( [ schcsm ] ) in terms of products of gaussian functions with different widths .",
    "thus , we select the square integrable solutions of eq .",
    "( [ schcsm ] ) , which are the three - body resonances , and discretize the continuum .",
    "a term of this expansion looks like @xmath35y_{l_1m_1}(\\widehat \\rho_1)\\cdot \\rho_2^{l_2 } \\exp [ -(\\rho_2/\\gamma_j)^2]y_{l_2m_2 } ( \\widehat \\rho_2)$ ] , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the angular momenta in the two relative motions , respectively , and the widths @xmath38 of the gaussians are the parameters of the expansion .",
    "we use the minnesota effective nucleon - nucleon interaction @xcite , together with the tensor force of @xcite .",
    "the space exchange parameter of the tensor force is adjusted to the splitting of the @xmath0@xmath39 phase shifts .",
    "as one can see in fig .  1 , this force produces @xmath40 phase shifts which are in good agreement with experiment . the higher partial waves , not shown in fig .  1 , are also close to the ( practically zero ) experimental values . in the three - neutron wave functions all @xmath41 partial waves up to @xmath42 are included . in some cases we checked the role of the @xmath43 partial waves and found them insignificant .    figure 2(a ) shows a typical result of our calculations , in this case for @xmath44 .",
    "what one can see is the complex eigenvalue spectra of eq .",
    "( [ schcsm ] ) , with @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the eigenvalues are all sitting on a half - life whose angle to the @xmath47 axis is roughly @xmath48 .",
    "this line is the discretized rotated continuum of eq .",
    "( [ schcsm ] ) .",
    "if there were a resonance in this partial wave , it would be in the upper right triangle , separated from the continuum points .    in fig .",
    "2(b ) we show the result for @xmath49 , which is found to be the only resonant partial wave .",
    "the resonant state is shown by the circle .",
    "we find that the dominant terms in the resonant @xmath49 wave function are the @xmath50=[(11)1,{{3}\\over{2}}]$ ] and @xmath51 $ ] @xmath52 components , where @xmath53 and @xmath14 are the the total angular momentum and total spin , respectively .",
    "the other components have small but non - negligible effects .    because we solve eq .",
    "( [ schcsm ] ) approximately , the resonance papameters depend slightly on @xmath27 . to find the optimal @xmath27 value one should repeat the calculations with several different @xmath27 values , and find a region where the resonance parameters are most insensitive to the change of @xmath27 .",
    "this way of finding the optimal @xmath27 value is related to the complex virial theorem @xcite . to reduce computer time ,",
    "we perform these calculations with a wave function which contains only the above mentioned two most important @xmath52 components . in fig .  3",
    "one can see that the optimal @xmath27 angle is somewhere between 0.3 and 0.35 rad .",
    "using such a @xmath27 value in the full model the parameters of the resonance are @xmath3 mev and @xmath54 mev .",
    "what can one say about possible resonances in other @xmath10 nuclei ?",
    "the effect of the coulomb force in the mirror three - proton system is trivial , pushing the @xmath55 resonance toward higher energy and increasing its width accordingly .",
    "the resonance parameters are @xmath4 mev and @xmath5 mev .",
    "the situation is more complex in the cases of @xmath0h and @xmath0he , because these nuclei have two - body channels below the three - nucleon thresholds .",
    "recently an experiment , studying the h@xmath56@xmath6he,@xmath7 ) reaction , found indications of an excited state of the triton at @xmath12 mev excitation energy with @xmath13 mev width @xcite .",
    "this state would be situated between the @xmath57 and @xmath58 thresholds .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite and @xcite that the dominant configuration in this state is the @xmath59 one , i.e. , the resonance originates from the closed three - body channel .",
    "unfortunately our current @xmath17 interaction is not appropriate for a calculation which contains all the relevant angular momentum configurations for the triton .",
    "this is because the minnesota force reproduces the @xmath0@xmath60 @xmath61 phase shift and the deuteron binding energy without the tensor force .",
    "however , we can estimate the role of the @xmath58 and @xmath57 channels in a restricted model , which contains @xmath0@xmath62 states just between the @xmath63 and @xmath64 but not inside the deuteron . th minnesota force is shown @xcite to give a good overall description for the @xmath65 , and supposedly for the @xmath57 , scattering in such a model .",
    "it is important to note that , if there is a resonance in the @xmath59 configuration , it must appear in a one - channel @xmath57 model , too .",
    "the reason is that any @xmath66 state that can be formed in the @xmath59 configuration can be built up from @xmath57 one , too , and this @xmath57 channel is nonorthogonal to the @xmath59 configuration .",
    "thus , as the csm is not well suited for finding poles at energies with negative real and imaginary parts ( the @xmath67 mev energy would mean such a position in the @xmath58 channel ) , we look for poles in the @xmath57 scattering .",
    "we use the analytic continuation of the @xmath14 matrix to complex energies @xcite , which is feasible for a two - body case and equivalent with the csm .",
    "a @xmath18 pole is found at @xmath68 mev @xmath57 center - of - mass energy with a width of 9 mev .",
    "the @xmath58 channel can be taken into account approximately , by using a few discretized continuum state of @xmath69 with positive energies and square - integrable wave functions .",
    "the inclusion of this @xmath58 channel does not change the pole position significantly .",
    "the dominant configuration of the wave function is @xmath57 , in contrast to the case of @xcite .",
    "the quality of our @xmath0@xmath60 and @xmath0@xmath62 @xmath17 forces makes it impossible too reach a firm conclusion concerning the existence of a narrow excited state of the triton .",
    "our main result is that the picture of @xcite and @xcite , namely that this state originates from the @xmath59 channel , is questionable .",
    "as such a state would be nonorthogonal to the @xmath57 channel , this latter configuration must be important .",
    "finally , we note that the use of realistic interactions together with a full model space ( including @xmath70 ) may change the parameters of the @xmath55 resonance .",
    "this is why we have made no attempt to further optimize our basis ( expansion length , gaussian widths , etc . ) and find more precise resonance parameters .",
    "our aim was to show the existence of such a state .",
    "in summary , we have searched for three - neutron resonances using the complex scaling method . we have found a @xmath71 resonant state at @xmath3 mev energy with @xmath72 mev width .",
    "all other partial waves up to @xmath1 were found to be nonresonant .",
    "the parameters of the mirror @xmath55 three - proton resonance are @xmath4 mev and @xmath73 mev .",
    "our results are inconclusive regarding the narrow excited state of the triton , but show the importance of the @xmath57 channel .",
    "the idea of this work came from discussions with roman kezerashvili and scott pratt .",
    "the work of a.  c.  was supported by wolfgang bauer s presidential faculty fellowship ( phy92 - 53505 ) and nsf grant no.phy94-03666 .",
