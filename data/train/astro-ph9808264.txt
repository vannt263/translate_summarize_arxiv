    "measurement of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is proving to be a powerful cosmological probe .",
    "proper statistical treatment of the data  likelihood calculation  is complicated and time - consuming , and promises to become prohibitively so in the very near future . here",
    ", we introduce approximations for this likelihood calculation which allow simple and accurate evaluation after the direct estimation of the power spectrum ( @xmath3 ) from the data .    although it is possible to produce constraints on cosmological parameters directly from the data , using the power spectrum as an intermediate step ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) has several advantages .",
    "the near - degeneracy of some combinations of cosmological parameters ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) implies the surfaces of constant likelihood in cosmological parameter space are highly elongated , making it difficult for search algorithms to navigate @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum space is much simpler than the cosmological parameter space since each multipole moment ( or band of multipole moments ) is usually only weakly dependent on the others , alleviating the search difficulties .",
    "although one still has the problem left of estimating nearly degenerate cosmological parameters from the resulting power spectrum constraints , the likelihood given the power spectrum constraints is much easier to compute than the likelihood given the map data .",
    "proceeding via the power spectrum also facilitates the calculation of constraints from multiple datasets . without this intermediate step , a joint analysis may often be prohibitively complicated .",
    "aspects particular to each experiment ( _ e.g. _ , offset removals , non - trivial chopping strategies ) make implementation of the analysis sufficiently laborious that no one has jointly analyzed more than a handful of datasets in this manner . reducing each dataset to a set of constraints on the power spectrum can serve as a form of data compression which simplifies further analysis .",
    "indeed , most studies of cosmological parameter constraints from all , or nearly all , of the recent data have used , as their starting points , published power spectrum constraints , [ @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite for joint analyses with other datasets ] .",
    "since the power spectrum constraints are usually described with orders of magnitude fewer numbers than the pixelized data , we refer to this compression as `` radical '' .    are there any disadvantages to proceeding via the power spectrum ? to answer this question ,",
    "let us consider the analysis procedure .",
    "most analyses of cmb datasets have assumed the noise and signal to be gaussian random variables , and to date there is no strong evidence to the contrary ( although for a different view , see @xcite ) .",
    "the simplicity of this model of the data allows for an exact bayesian analysis , which has been performed for almost all datasets individually .",
    "the procedure is conceptually straightforward : maximize the probability @xmath4 over the allowed parameter space .",
    "most often , we take the prior probability for the parameters to be constant , so this is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood , @xmath5 . because we have assumed the noise and signal to be gaussian , this latter is just a multivariate gaussian _ in the data _ ; the theoretical parameters enter into the covariance matrix .",
    "fortunately , if the theoretical signal is indeed normally distributed and in addition the signals are statistically isotropic , the power spectrum encodes all of the information about the model , and all of the constraints on the parameters of the theory can be obtained from the @xmath3 probability distribution : _",
    "i.e. _ , the likelihood as a function of some ( cosmological ) parameters , @xmath6 , is just the likelihood as a function of the power spectrum determined from those parameters : @xmath7)$ ] .",
    "thus the constraints on the power spectrum may serve as our `` compressed dataset '' .",
    "( if the theory is not isotropic , as may occur for nontrivial topologies ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) , or is non - gaussian , then the analysis must go beyond the isotropic power spectrum . )    a problem arises though due to the fact that the uncertainties in the power spectrum determination are not gaussian - distributed .",
    "thus if we compress the power spectrum probability distribution to a mean ( or mode  the location of the posterior maximum ) and a variance , we lose the information contained in the higher order moments .",
    "one might be tempted to rely on the central limit theorem and hope that the posterior for the power spectrum is sufficiently close to a gaussian that a simple @xmath8 procedure will suffice .",
    "this is what has been done in recent joint analyses of current cmb data ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . and",
    "what has been advocated for the analysis of satellite data ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite )",
    ".    not only is information discarded with this procedure , however  which one might think of as merely increasing the final error bars  but neglect of this effect leads to a bias @xcite . here",
    "we show that the information loss and its effects , such as this bias , can be greatly reduced by assuming the posterior distribution to have a specific non - gaussian form parameterized by the likelihood maximum , the covariance matrix and a third quantity which measures the noise contribution to the uncertainty of each measured amplitude .",
    "a relatively fast algorithm for determining the power spectrum or other parameters is the `` quadratic estimator '' @xcite , although it still requires @xmath9 operations , where @xmath10 is the number of pixels in the dataset .",
    "our view of quadratic estimation is that , used iteratively , it is a particular method for finding the maximum of the likelihood and the parameter covariance matrix @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the information loss associated with compression to a mode and covariance matrix has nothing to do with how that mode and covariance matrix are calculated .",
    "other methods of likelihood analysis will , of course , suffer the same problems when the constraints are reduced to these two sets of quantities .",
    "in fact , the quadratic estimation algorithm has the advantage that an implementation of it as a computer code can be used ( with very minor changes ) to calculate the new noise contribution quantity .    in section  [ sec :",
    "likelihood ] , we describe the problems generated by the non - gaussianity of the likelihood function , and propose solutions which allow rapid and simple calculation of cosmological likelihoods for cmb data at the price of calculating only this single new parameter at each @xmath11 ( or band ) . @xcite have used an ansatz , essentially equivalent to the equal - variance approximation of sec .",
    "[ sec : indmode ] to arrive at similar results . ) in section  [ sec : dmr ] , we test this method via application to cobe / dmr data . in section  [ sec : general ] , we extend the formalism to more complicated chopping experiments and to the measurement of other amplitude parameters such as bandpowers .",
    "we apply these extensions to the saskatoon data in section  [ sec : sk ] , to ovro , sp and suzie in section  [ sec : upperlim ] , and saskatoon combined with cobe / dmr , in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we then apply our procedure to the more ambitious task of fitting an eleven parameter model to a compendium of all cmb results to date in section  [ sec : bands ] .",
    "previous explorations of parameter space have been limited to much lower dimensionality and have assumed gaussianity ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the parameters are the power in eleven bins from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "we study the robustness of the resulting maximum likelihood power spectrum to assumptions about the noise contribution to the error , different binnings and selective editings of the data .",
    "the binned power spectrum , fit to the band - power data , provides an excellent tool for visualizing the combined power spectrum constraints from all the data .",
    "such a figure should replace the usual one of all the band powers , which is much harder to interpret .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclude ] we discuss the results and conclude , ending with an exhortation to the community to calculate and provide the appropriate quantities for all future experiments .    throughout , we will use @xmath3 to refer to the usual cmb power spectrum , and define @xmath12",
    "to illustrate the problem , consider an unrealistic `` experiment '' covering the whole sky with no noise . in this case",
    ", the data at pixel @xmath13 , @xmath14 is just the actual sky signal , @xmath15 , and the correlation matrix , @xmath16 , is just the correlation function @xmath17 . even in this case , the observed sky is just one realization of the underlying power spectrum . to determine these @xmath18",
    ", we still must resort to the likelihood function . in this case , @xmath19 up to an irrelevant additive constant . in the second line ,",
    "we define the observed power spectrum of this realization as @xmath20 where the @xmath21 are the spherical harmonic coefficients of the ( noise - free ) observed sky .",
    "a gaussian distribution has the following properties : it is completely specified by its mean and covariance matrix ( higher moments of the distribution can be derived from these ) ; the covariance matrix is given by the inverse of the curvature matrix ( defined as @xmath22 ) ; and the curvature matrix is independent of @xmath23 .",
    "none of these properties hold for the distribution in eq .",
    "[ eqn : nonoiselike ] , which is non - gaussian . for a non - gaussian distribution ,",
    "it is therefore often useful to consider the ensemble average curvature , also known as the _ fisher matrix _ , @xmath24 .    what happens if , despite the non - gaussianity of the distribution in eq .",
    "[ eqn : nonoiselike ] , one identifies the covariance matrix with the inverse of the curvature matrix and then ignores higher order moments ?",
    "the first step would be calculation of the curvature matrix : @xmath25 note that , unlike for a gaussian distribution , the curvature depends on @xmath23 .",
    "the natural remedy is to evaluate it at the peak of the likelihood , @xmath26",
    ". the standard error ( square root of the variance ) is then given by @xmath27 .",
    "note though that , uncertainties derived in this manner are larger if @xmath26 has fluctuated upward from the underlying `` real '' value and smaller for a downward fluctuation . if , in addition , we ignore higher order moments of the distribution , then upward fluctuations are given less weight than downward fluctuations , resulting in a downward bias for the overall power spectrum amplitude .",
    "it is generally the lowest multipole moments constrained by an observation that have the most non - gaussian distributions .",
    "as has been seen @xcite and will be seen again below , this may contribute to some of the confusion in the community regarding the so - called anomalous value of the cobe quadrupole .    in the presence of noisy data over partial areas of the sky , the likelihood is no longer so simple , and must be laboriously calculated ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite;@xcite;@xcite;@xcite ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cl_like1 ] we show the actual likelihood for the cobe quadrupole and other multipoles , along with the gaussian that would be assumed given the curvature matrix calculated from the data .",
    "the figures show another way of understanding the bias introduced by assuming gaussianity : upward deviations from the mean ( which is not actually the mean of the non - gaussian distribution , but the mode ) are overly disfavored by the gaussian distributions while downward ones are overly probable .",
    "for example , the standard - cdm value of @xmath28 is only 0.2 times less likely than the most likely value of @xmath29 but it seems like a 5-sigma excursion ( @xmath30 times less likely ) based on the curvature alone .",
    "although it is extremely pronounced in the case of the quadrupole this is a problem that plagues all cmb data : the actual distribution is skewed to allow larger positive excursions than negative .",
    "the full likelihood `` knows '' about this and in fact takes it into account ; however , if we compress the data to observed @xmath31 ( or even observed @xmath23 and a correlation matrix @xmath32 ) we lose this information about the shape of the likelihood function . because of its relation to the well - known phenomenon of cosmic variance , we choose to call this problem one of _ cosmic bias_.    we emphasize that cosmic bias can be important even in high - s / n experiments with many pixels .",
    "we might expect the central limit theorem to hold in this case and the distributions to become gaussian .",
    "indeed they do , at least near the peak .",
    "however , the central limit theorem does not guarantee that the tails of the distribution will approach those of a gaussian as rapidly as does the region near the peak and there is the danger that a few seemingly discrepant points are given considerably more weight than they deserve .",
    "cosmic bias has also been noted in previous work @xcite .    putting the problem",
    "a bit more formally , we see that even in the limit of infinite signal - to - noise we can not use a simple @xmath8 test on @xmath23 estimates ; such a test implicitly assumes a gaussian likelihood . unlike the distribution discussed here",
    ", a gaussian would have constant curvature ( @xmath33 ) , rather than @xmath34 as illustrated here .",
    "we emphasize that the problem as outlined here is easily solved in principle : just calculate using the full likelihood function .",
    "unfortunately , this is more easily said than done  direct calculation of the likelihood function takes @xmath35 operations per parameter - space point . for the @xmath36 datasets already coming , this is prohibitively expensive .",
    "indeed , it is not even clear how to perform the operations necessary even to find the likelihood peak and variance in a reasonable time @xcite .",
    "it is likely that other forms of data compression and/or new algorithms will be necessary even at this stage of the analysis .",
    "signal - to - noise eigenmodes , discussed in appendix  [ app : snmode ] , have been suggested as a useful compression tool @xcite and used in some analyses @xcite .",
    "instead , we must find efficient ways to approximate the likelihood function based on minimal information . in the rest of this paper , we discuss two approximations , each motivated by different aspects of our knowledge of the likelihood function .",
    "each requires only knowledge of the likelihood peak and curvature ( or variance ) as well as a third quantity related to the noise properties of the experiment .",
    "alternately , for already - calculated likelihood functions , each approximation gives a functional form for fitting with a small number of parameters .",
    "we already know enough about the likelihood to see a solution to this problem . for a given multipole @xmath11 , there are two distinct regimes of likelihood .",
    "add uniform pixel noise and a finite beam to the simple all - sky `` experiment '' considered above .",
    "now , the likelihood has contributions from the signal , @xmath21 , and the noise , @xmath37 ( after transforming again to spherical harmonics ) .",
    "@xmath38\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( as usual up to an irrelevant additive constant ) , with @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the noise power spectrum in spherical harmonics , and @xmath41\\ \\sum_m |a_{\\ell    m}|^2/(2\\ell+1)$ ] is the power spectrum of the full data ( noise plus beam - smoothed signal ) ; we have written it as a different symbol from above to emphasize the inclusion of noise and again use script lettering to refer to quantities multiplied by @xmath42 .",
    "now , the likelihood is maximized at @xmath43 and the curvature about this maximum is given by @xmath44 so the error ( defined by the variance ) on a @xmath23 is @xmath45    note that in this expression there is once again indication of a bias if we assume gaussianity : upward fluctuations have larger uncertainty than downward fluctuations .",
    "but this is not true for @xmath46 where @xmath46 is defined so that @xmath47 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath48 .",
    "since @xmath49 is proportional to a constant , our approximation to the likelihood is to take @xmath46 as normally distributed .",
    "that is , we approximate @xmath50 ( up to a constant ) where @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the weight matrix ( covariance matrix inverse ) of the @xmath23 , usually taken to be the curvature matrix . we refer to eq .",
    "[ eqn : gausslike ] as the offset lognormal distribution of @xmath23 .",
    "somewhat more generally we write @xmath53 for some constant @xmath54 , which for the case at hand is @xmath55 .",
    "it is illustrative to derive the quantity @xmath46 in a somewhat more abstract fashion .",
    "we wish to find a change of variables from @xmath23 to @xmath46 such that the curvature matrix is a constant : @xmath56 that is , we want to find a change of variables such that @xmath57 is not a function of @xmath58 .",
    "we immediately know of one such transformation which would seem to do the trick : @xmath59 where the @xmath60 indicates a cholesky decomposition or hermitian square root . in general",
    ", this will be a horrendously overdetermined set of equations , @xmath61 equations in @xmath62 unknowns .",
    "however , we can solve this equation in general if we take the curvature matrix to be given everywhere by the diagonal form for the simplified experiment we have been discussing ( eq .",
    "[ eqn : fullcurv ] ) . in this case , the equations decouple and lose their dependence on the data , becoming ( up to a constant factor ) @xmath63 the solution to this differential equation is just what we expected , @xmath64 with correlation matrix @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67",
    ". please note that we are calculating a constant correlation matrix ; the @xmath23 in the denominator of this expression should be taken at the peak of the likelihood ( _ i.e. _ , the estimated quantities ) .",
    "we emphasize that , even for an all - sky continuously and uniformly sampled experiment ( for which eq .",
    "[ eqn : fullcurv ] is exact ) , this gaussian form , eq .",
    "[ eqn : gausslike ] , is only an approximation , since the curvature matrix is given by eq .",
    "[ eqn : fullcurv ] only at the peak .",
    "nonetheless we expect it to be a better approximation than a naive gaussian in @xmath23 ( which we note is the limit @xmath68 of the offset lognormal ) .",
    "we also note that there is another approximation involved in this expression : by choosing just a single independent change of variable for each @xmath11 we assume that the correlation structure is unchanged as you move away from the likelihood peak .",
    "often a very good approximation to the curvature matrix is its ensemble average , the fisher matrix , @xmath69 .",
    "below , unless mentioned otherwise , we use the fisher matrix in place of the curvature matrix . however , we will see that in our application to the saskatoon data , the differences between the curvature matrix and fisher matrix can be significant .",
    "in this subsection we consider an alternate form for the likelihood function @xmath70 that is sometimes a better approximation than the offset - lognormal form .",
    "the approximation is exact in the limit that the observations can be decomposed into modes that are independent , with equal variances .",
    "for example , for a switching experiment in which the temperature of @xmath71 pixels are measured , with the same noise @xmath72 at each point , and such that each pixel is far enough from the others that there is no correlation between the points , the likelihood can be written as @xmath73\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is such that @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the pixel temperatures .",
    "the independent pixel idealization was very close to the case for the ovro experiment , and , as we show in section  [ sec : upperlim ] , the calculated likelihood is well approximated by this equation .",
    "the maximum likelihood occurs at a signal amplitude @xmath77 which is related to the data by @xmath78 .",
    "if we define @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 then we can rewrite eq .",
    "[ eqn : equalindepmode ] in a form that will be useful for relating it to the previous offset- lognormal form : @xmath82.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that if we consider only a single @xmath11 then the above form applies to eq .",
    "[ eqn : fullskylike ] as well , with @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "we know this should be the case since the likelihood of eq .",
    "[ eqn : fullskylike ] ( for a single @xmath11 ) is also one for independent modes ( @xmath85 ) with equal variances ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "if we fix @xmath71 and @xmath87 for each mode ( _ e.g. _ , band of @xmath11 ) , we refer to this as the `` equal variance approximation . ''",
    "also note that the first term in the expansion of eq .",
    "[ eqn : equalindepmode2 ] in @xmath88 is @xmath89 , which with the identification , @xmath90 , is the offset - lognormal form .",
    "thus when the modes have equal variance and are independent , then the offset lognormal form is simply the first term in a taylor expansion of the equal - variance form .",
    "an advantage of the full form is that the asymptotic form @xmath91 linear in @xmath58 for large signal amplitudes holds ( and thus gives a power law rather than exponential decay in @xmath92 ) , whereas the offset lognormal is dominated by the @xmath93 .",
    "an advantage of the offset - lognormal form is that it does not require the existence of equal and independent modes .",
    "figure  [ fig : dmrlike ] shows that for the range of relevance for the likelihoods for dmr , the offset lognormal and the equal / independent variance likelihood approximations are quite close over the dominant 2-sigma falloff from maximum .",
    "we have found this to generally be true .    for either form ,",
    "three quantities need to be specified , the noise - related offset @xmath87 , @xmath94 and @xmath71 . given @xmath87 , @xmath95",
    "is determined from the maximum likelihood and @xmath71 can be determined from the curvature of the likelihood .",
    "one could also specify the amplitudes @xmath96 at three points , _",
    "e.g. _ , at the maximum and the places where @xmath97 falls by @xmath98 , the upper and lower one - sigma errors if the distribution were fit on either side by a gaussian . forcing the approximation to pass through these points enforces values of @xmath87 , @xmath94 and @xmath71 .    in section  [ sec : bands ] , we apply these approximations to power spectrum estimation from current data for which the practice has been to quote a signal amplitude with upper and lower one - sigma errors , say @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 . often these are bayesian estimates , determined by choosing a prior probability for @xmath96 and integrating the likelihood",
    ". sometimes the @xmath98 points are given , which are slightly easier to implement in fitting for @xmath87 and @xmath71 . since the tail of eq .",
    "[ eqn : equalindepmode2 ] is quite pronounced , resulting in a dramatic asymmetry in @xmath92 between the up and down sides of the maximum even in the @xmath58 variable , we have found that just using the second derivative of the likelihood or the fisher matrix approximation to it to fix @xmath71 is not as good as assuming the offset lognormal and requiring that the functional forms match at the upper @xmath98 point .",
    "thus , if the error @xmath102 is from the curvature or fisher matrix , then we prefer the choice @xmath103^{-1 } \\",
    ", , \\   \\sigma_z = { \\sigma_{{\\cal c}}\\over { \\widehat{{\\cal c}}}+x } = { 1\\over \\sqrt{{\\cal f}^{(z)}}}\\ ] ] rather than the curvature form @xmath104 , or the @xmath105^{-1}$ ] average of the @xmath106 widths .",
    "this is what was done in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmrlike ] , and in all subsequent figures .    fig .",
    "[ fig : dmrlike ] shows that a linear @xmath107 asymptote in the log - likelihood is not always correct and sometimes the lognormal does better . that the tail often declines faster can be understood in terms of an effective number of modes @xmath108 which increases as @xmath96 increases . to demonstrate this",
    ", it is useful to consider the likelihood behavior for `` signal - to - noise '' eigenmodes , which are linear combinations of the pixelized data which make them statistically independent for gaussian signals and noise .",
    "the data is then characterized by observed amplitudes @xmath109 , with a noise contribution transformed to give unity variance , and a signal contribution with amplitude @xmath110 , in terms of a `` signal - to - noise '' eigenvalue @xmath111 and an overall amplitude @xmath96 .",
    "such transformations have been much discussed in the literature ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite;@xcite;@xcite;@xcite ) , and we will not go into the details here ; for more details on using this formalism to examine the overall form of the likelihood function , see appendix  [ app : snmode ] .    the cases in which we expect eq .",
    "[ eqn : equalindepmode2 ] to be a good approximation are those in which the eigenmodes have a broad region over which @xmath112 varies slowly and a very rapid falloff towards zero beyond .",
    "this is exact for the independent pixel points described above , with @xmath113 the same for all @xmath71 modes . if there were a number of frequency channels as well as pixels , only the linear combinations which are flat in thermodynamic temperature have this @xmath112 , and the rest are zero . for cases where the equal variance approximation is not exact",
    ", the signal - to - noise modes will have different eigenvalues @xmath112 .",
    "one might then take an effective @xmath71 to be the number of modes with @xmath114 or some other cutoff ( since these are the ones that have greater signal than noise ) .",
    "however , then @xmath71 grows as @xmath23 increases , altering the power - law tail .",
    "thus , the very general approach of `` signal - to - noise '' eigenmodes has allowed us to understand that the simple law with an effective @xmath71 will usually overshoot the high @xmath96 tail somewhat , even though it fits very well to 1-sigma , and usually beyond .",
    "the offset lognormal form , motivated by it , could err on either side , since it would presuppose a specific sort of increase in the number of eigenmodes contributing .",
    "fortunately either approximation seems to work well enough to allow accurate parameter estimation from a very small set of numbers .",
    "we first apply these methods to the anisotropy measurements of the dmr instrument on the cobe satellite @xcite .",
    "the dmr instrument actually measured a complicated set of temperature differences @xmath115 apart on the sky , but the data were reported in the much simpler form of a temperature map , along with appropriate errors ( which we have expanded to take into account correlations generated by the differencing strategy , as treated in @xcite , following @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the theoretical correlation matrix includes the effects of the beam , digitization of the time stream , and an isotropized treatment of pixelization , using the table given by @xcite , modified for resolution 5 .",
    "we use a weighted combination of the 31 , 53 and 90  ghz maps . because most of the information in the data is at large angular scales , we use the maps degraded to `` resolution 5 '' which has 1536 pixels .",

    ", we have an average inverse weight per solid angle of @xmath122 ( equivalent to an rms noise of @xmath123 on @xmath124 pixels ) .    with these numbers ,",
    "we show the full likelihood in comparison to the `` naive gaussian '' approximation , as well as our offset lognormal ansatz .",
    "while the naive gaussian approximation consistently overestimates the likelihood below the peak and underestimates it above the peak , the lognormal form reproduces the full expression extremely well in both regimes .",
    "the gaussian form of the offset lognormal form makes using the power spectrum estimates for parameter estimation very simple : we evaluate a @xmath8 in the quantity @xmath46 rather than @xmath23 ( although the model is now nonlinear in the spectral parameters ) .",

    "just as one computes the curvature about the maximum likelihood , so one can consider computing a skewness that would encapsulate such behavior , but we will leave the search for further likelihood function approximations to further exploration .    we have shown that the offset lognormal approximation applied to a two - parameter ( @xmath125 and @xmath193 ) family of cdm models works very well .",
    "we have also used this form to find the maximum - likelihood binned power spectrum , given the band - power data .",
    "the resulting graphs provide a visual representation of the power spectrum constraints that is , in our opinion , far superior to plotting all the band - power data on top of each other .    the exercise of estimating the binned power spectrum immediately raises the question of how well it would work to estimate cosmological parameters using these as a `` super - radically compressed dataset '' .",
    "we plan to pursue this question in future work .",
    "although our examples have focused on using our approximations in order to derive parameter constraints from more than one dataset , we believe they may also prove useful for estimating cosmological parameters from single , very powerful datasets , such as those that are expected to come from a number of experiments over the next decade .",
    "we must note though that once a dataset has sufficient `` spectral resolving power '' and dynamic range there is another approach that can be used to remove the cosmic bias .",
    "this alternative approach was suggested in @xcite and @xcite and successfully applied to simulated map data in @xcite .",
    "the idea is to exploit the fact that we expect there to be no fine features in the cmb power spectrum and therefore use some smoothed version of the estimated power spectrum to calculate the fisher matrix .",
    "heuristically one expects this to remove the bias , since upward - fluctuating points no longer receive less weight than downward - fluctuating points .",
    "although this smoothing technique is quite likely to be successful , we point out that , unlike our ansatz , it relies on an assumption of the smoothness of the power spectrum .",
    "one of our main objectives with this paper is to provide observers with a method for presenting their results that will allow efficient combination with the results of others in order to create a joint determination of cosmological parameters .",
    "the method is fully described in appendix  [ app : recipe ] . in this appendix",
    "we also discuss complications due to overlapping sky coverage and upper limits .",

    "therefore , we present the following alternative method for reporting upper limits which includes a prescription for creation of a filter function .    the data can be reported as amplitudes of signal - to - noise eigenmodes and their eigenvalues ( see appendix  [ app : snmode ] ) .",
