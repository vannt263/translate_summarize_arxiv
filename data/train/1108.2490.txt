    "consider @xmath0 random walkers on a line .",
    "the only interaction between the walkers is that if any two walkers meet , they annihilate each other , hence these walkers are deemed vicious .",
    "this system was introduced by m. e. fisher in his 1983 boltzmann medal lecture and was applied to interfacial wetting in @xmath7 dimensions since the interaction of different interfaces ( walkers ) drives the wetting transition  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the fermionic nature of vicious walkers provides a coulomb gas description and , thereby , a link with gaussian random matrices  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , baik has proven that a particular limiting conditional distribution of the displacement of the leftmost walker is equivalent to the tracy - widom distribution for the gaussian orthogonal ensemble(goe )  @xcite . moreover , vicious walker configurations correspond to directed polymer brushes with the vicious mechanism capturing the non - intersecting property of the polymers  @xcite .",
    "so while the study of vicious walkers has attracted attention from the mathematical physics community , a number of different physical applications also drive its study .",
    "there have been generalizations of vicious walkers to dissimilar walkers  @xcite , walkers with drift  @xcite , and walkers with external potentials  @xcite . here",
    ", we introduce a system of @xmath0 accelerating vicious walkers and study the survival probability , @xmath8 , the probability of having none of the @xmath0 walkers annihilated up to time @xmath9 . in one - dimension , a randomly accelerating walker , @xmath10 , is defined by    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is gaussian noise with @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the corresponding fokker - planck equation is @xmath15p(x , v , t)=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}p(x , v , t),\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the probability density distribution for a randomly accelerating walker in one - dimension .",
    "a randomly accelerating walker is presumably the simplest non - markovian stochastic process .",
    "given the fermionic interaction between vicious accelerating walkers , one can explore the possibility of a non - markovian analogue to the coulomb gas and , hence , a potentially new class of non - markovian random matrices .",
    "recently , fukushima and collaborators have revisited dyson s original brownian motion model for random matrices and found another non - markovian stochastic process after generalizing the coefficients of the matrices  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a randomly accelerating walker appears in the boltzmann weight of an extensible , semiflexible polymer of length @xmath17 with non - zero bending energy  @xcite . for a given displacement vector @xmath18 from some reference point along a contour length , @xmath19 , the hamiltonian , @xmath20 ,",
    "is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the tangent vector and @xmath23 characterizes the bending rigidity .",
    "mapping the contour length @xmath19 to time @xmath9 and the displacement vector @xmath24 to @xmath25 , the equation of motion for this system corresponds to a randomly accelerating walker in the corresponding dimension . implementing the vicious interaction between @xmath0 random accelerating walkers",
    ", therefore , corresponds to the statistics of non - intersecting semiflexible polymer brushes . in the interest of studying a mixture of flexible and semiflexible polymer brushes",
    ", one can also address a mixture of vicious accelerating and random walkers .",
    "please see the appendix for some discussion of @xmath26 vicious mixed walkers system .",
    "we begin by considering @xmath28 vicious accelerating walkers in one - dimension with equal diffusion constants @xmath29 .",
    "the two accelerating walkers are governed by the equation , @xmath30 with the initial condition , @xmath31 , with @xmath32 .",
    "in addition , to compute the survival probability , @xmath8 , we implement the boundary condition , @xmath33 such that the system `` dies '' when the two walkers meet in space and have ingoing velocities .",
    "note that the boundary condition in @xmath34 is redundant since , due to the initial positions , the two walkers can not meet with a relative outgoing velocity .",
    "we then choose the relative coordinate system to reduce the @xmath28 vicious accelerating walkers to one random accelerating walker in the presence of an absorbing wall .",
    "this change of variables takes the form , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the fokker - planck equation thereby reduces to @xmath37p(x , v , t)=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}p(x , v , t),\\ ] ] with the boundary condition , @xmath38    the survival probability for this process is nontrivial in that one can not invoke the method of images as is done for the ordinary random walker .",
    "using properties of the integral of a brownian curve , sinai  @xcite proved that the asymptotic survival probability distribution is given by @xmath39 at long times .",
    "note that the first - passage time distribution , @xmath40 , where the first passage time is defined by the time at which any of the two walkers meet is given by @xmath41 such that @xmath42 .",
    "in general , if the survival probability distribution is given by @xmath43 at large times , then @xmath44 with @xmath45",
    ".    a heuristic argument , based on sinai s approach , for @xmath46 was given in ref .",
    "first , a new time counter , @xmath47 , is defined by each `` original '' time the velocity crosses zero . in other words , the original time is now defined by the distribution of first - passage time of a random walk undergoing a levy flight with levy index @xmath48 . moreover , with this new counting , the position variable is also a levy flight with levy index @xmath49 . by invoking the powerful superuniversality of the sparre - andersen theorem in one - dimension  @xcite ,",
    "the first passage time distribution for the position in terms of @xmath47 is the same as for a random walk , i.e. @xmath50 . to convert back to the original time",
    ", one simply needs to compute the integral @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the limiting distribution for the sum of @xmath47 @xmath48 levy variables . we should also mention that burkhardt  @xcite made the use of marshall - watson functions@xcite to solve for the laplace transform version of eq .",
    "6 with the absorbing boundary condition .    to numerically check for @xmath46 result ( and other results ) , we implement the go - with - the winners algorithm  @xcite .",
    "we do this because as @xmath0 increases , the first passage time exponent @xmath53 increases , making it more difficult to sample the tail of the distribution . the go - with - the winners algorithm iterates replica systems in parallel .",
    "once at least one pair of random accelerators have crossed paths in some fraction of the replicas , those surviving replicas are copied over to the replicas that have already `` died '' .",
    "we choose that fraction to be one - half such that each copy generated carries a relative weight of @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the number of copies , which is then incorporated into the survival probability .",
    "the number of replicas range between @xmath56 and @xmath57 . the number of runs averaged over range between @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "fluctuations between the runs are then used for error analysis .",
    "having calibrated our results for the @xmath28 case , we now consider @xmath2 vicious accelerating walkers with equal diffusion constants .",
    "the fokker - planck equation is given by @xmath60p(x , v , t ) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}p(x , v , t),\\ ] ] where @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "we apply change of variables @xmath36 ,",
    "@xmath63 , @xmath35 , @xmath64 such that the lhs operator for two relative coordinates becomes @xmath65 with the absorbing boundary at @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "again , here , boundary conditions on the velocities are redundant . to remove the coupled term in @xmath70 and @xmath34",
    ", we perform another set of linear transforms , @xmath71 and @xmath72 to obtain @xmath73 with absorbing boundaries , @xmath74 , i.e. a @xmath75 wedge in the @xmath76 plane .",
    "we have reduced three vicious accelerating walkers in one - dimension to one accelerating walker in two - dimensions in a wedge geometry . for comparative purposes ,",
    "let us review the ordinary random walker in a wedge  @xcite . using the conformal mapping @xmath77",
    ", one can map the wedge geometry to the upper - half plane .",
    "then , the motion in @xmath78-direction becomes unbounded and in the @xmath79-direction it is the simple situation of a one - dimensional walker with an absorbing boundary condition .",
    "the survival probability distribution asymptotically in the upper - half plane is @xmath80 . after an inverse conformal mapping",
    ", one arrives at the survival probability distribution of @xmath81 .",
    "while there is currently no analytical solution for the survival probability distribution for an accelerating walker in a @xmath75 wedge geometry , for a @xmath82 wedge , the sparre - andersen theorem can be invoked for the two indepedent directions to arrive at an asymptotic power - law survival probability distribution with @xmath83 .",
    "in addition , for a @xmath84 wedge , @xmath85 . while the sparre - andersen theorem is quite powerful and",
    "can easily be extended to as many independent dimensions as needed , the @xmath75 wedge geometry couples the two directions ( for @xmath2 , at least ) and , therefore , the sparre - andersen theorem , as it stands , can not be invoked .",
    "however , to smoothly interpolate between the @xmath82 and @xmath84 cases , we conjecture that for other wedge angles , the survival probability distribution also asymptotes to a power - law with survival probability exponent , @xmath1 , with @xmath1 decreasing continuously as the wedge angle increases . to this conjecture ,",
    "we resort to numerical simulation of both the wedge geometry for one accelerating walker and the line geometry for three accelerating walkers .",
    "the result is presented in fig .",
    "1 . we measure a survival probability exponent of @xmath3 for @xmath2 vicious accelerating walkers in a line , which agrees with the @xmath75 wedge geometry result ( with essentially the same error bar ) .",
    "also , referring back to the accelerating walker - levy flight mapping implemented to demonstrate the @xmath85 exponent for an absorbing accelerating walker in one - dimension , simulating a @xmath49 levy flight in a @xmath75 wedge geometry with the opening angle , @xmath86 , between @xmath87 and @xmath75 , yields @xmath88 .",
    "figure 2 tests our conjecture that @xmath1 continuously decreases with increasing wedge angle .",
    "both the numerical values of @xmath1 for the @xmath82 and @xmath84 wedges agree well with their analytical counterparts . for comparison purposes ,",
    "we have also plotted the curve @xmath89 , which agrees with the two analytical solutions and can be viewed as a trivial extension of the random walker solution . while the agreement looks reasonable at larger angles ,",
    "the deviation becomes more apparent at smaller angles .",
    "it also appears that the divergence in @xmath1 as @xmath86 decreases to zero is slower than @xmath90 .",
    "now , we numerically address @xmath91 vicious accelerating walkers . to compare with ordinary vicious walkers ,",
    "based on the method of images , fisher  @xcite considered one compound walker in @xmath0 dimensions that can not cross any of the @xmath92 or @xmath93 linear manifolds . using the method of images ,",
    "as long as the initial positive and negative weights ( corresponding to unrestricted positive and negative walkers ) are chosen such that probability distribution is antisymmetric under reflection within each linear manifold , then the distribution will satisfy the absorbing boundary conditions for all future times .",
    "these weights can be represented as a vandemond determinant , which can be factorized to yield a product of @xmath94 pairings such that @xmath95 , where @xmath96 .",
    "previous and the current simulations verify this prediction .",
    "see figure 3 . by the same argument , if the survival exponent for two ( one pair of ) vicious accelerating walkers is @xmath97 , the survival exponent for @xmath0 vicious accelerating walkers system should be @xmath98",
    ". however , for vicious accelerating walkers , the method of images fails .    based on the @xmath28 and @xmath2 results , combined with the fact that @xmath0 vicious accelerating walkers can be mapped to one accelerating walker in @xmath99 dimensions in an unbounded domain",
    ", we expect the power - law survival probability distribution extends to @xmath91 . in figure 3",
    "we present the simulation results of survival probability exponents for vicious accelerating walkers system up to @xmath100 , as well as the too trivial prediction , @xmath101 .",
    "the deviation is apparent at large @xmath0 .",
    "we find that @xmath98 is clearly an upper bound for the measured @xmath0 .",
    "the non - markovian nature of the accelerating walker enables the system to survive longer and in a way that can not be accounted for by individual pairings .",
    "as mentioned previously , vicious gaussian walkers problem is closely related to the gaussian random matrix theory .",
    "a matrix with random entries falls into this category as long as the entries are independent and identically distributed ( iid ) variables with a finite second moment of the corresponding distribution .",
    "a generalization of the random gaussian matrix is the random levy matrix  @xcite , where the entries are drawn from a broader distribution , namely a levy distribution .",
    "the most important characteristic of levy distribution is a heavy power - law tail step - size @xmath102 distribution , @xmath103 for large @xmath102 .",
    "when @xmath104 , the variance of the distribution is finite and , hence , the central limit theorem holds for the distribution of the sum of independently drawn levy variables .",
    "similarly , the random levy matrices reduce to random gaussian matrices .",
    "however in the regime @xmath105 , the variance of the distribution diverges and hence random levy matrices behave qualitatively different from random gaussian matrices . for example , the famous wigner - dyson semicircular law is replaced with a density of states that extends over the entire eigenvalue axis  @xcite .    inspired by the connection between vicious gaussian walkers and random gaussian matrices as well as the connection between levy flights and random accelerating walkers , we study the problem of vicious levy flights . given @xmath0 levy flights in one - dimension , we define the vicious interaction between pairs . because levy flights are nonlocal",
    ", two levy flights jump over each other without meeting at some exact point .",
    "hence , there could be two ways to define the vicious interaction , to prohibit the jump - overs or to allow for jump - overs and the annihilation occurs upon intersection within some range , irrespective of the ordering .",
    "the latter has been recently studied@xcite . however , we are more interested in the former case , in which the set of levy flights annihilate whenever a crossing occurs . in other words ,",
    "a surviving system strictly maintains the initial ordering of all flights , which is the same as for the vicious gaussian walkers .",
    "the fokker - planck equation for a system of @xmath0 one - dimensional vicious levy flights is described as @xmath106 where the normal laplacian is replaced by the riesz - feller derivative of fractional order @xmath107  @xcite .",
    "this derivative has an integral representation , which more easily reveals its nonlocal nature .",
    "the initial condition is still @xmath108 , with @xmath109 for all @xmath110 .",
    "the boundary condition for the non - crossing vicious interaction as we described above is then @xmath111 , if @xmath112 for any @xmath110 .",
    "the @xmath28 case is , again , equivalent to the first - passage problem of a single levy flight via a transformation to relative coordinates ( and integrating out the center of mass coordinate ) .",
    "the only difference with a random walker is that the absorbing boundary condition at the origin has to be modified to an absorbing region occuping the positive x - axis to preserve the non - crossing property .",
    "the first - passage property of a levy flight is governed by the sparre - andersen theorem@xcite , which implies that the first - passage time distribution for any symmetric step size distribution in one - dimension asymptotes to the same as that of a gaussian walker .",
    "thus , the survival probability exponent for @xmath28 is @xmath113 independent of @xmath114 .",
    "we verify this result in our simulation . see figure 4 .",
    "note that this result is very different from the result obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite where @xmath1 depends on @xmath114 for @xmath28 and higher .",
    "we also simulate @xmath2 vicious levy flights . because of the linearity of fractional derivatives , the mapping of two vicious levy flights to a single levy flights in an absorbing plane holds . however ,",
    "due to the lack of rotational invariance of the riesz - feller derivative , the wedge mapping that holds for vicious walkers and now for vicious accelerating walkers , does not apply to vicious levy flights . in order to make progress , since for @xmath28 there exists a power - law distribution , we conjecture that the survival probability distribution scales as a power - law at long times for @xmath115 and measure @xmath1 . figure 4 plots the survival probability exponents for @xmath2 vicious levy flights for several different levy indices . for @xmath28",
    "all values of @xmath114 yield the same survival probability exponent of 1/2 , in agreement with the sparre - andersen theorem . however , the @xmath2 exponents appear to vary with @xmath114 . for instance , for @xmath5 , @xmath6 . while the 0.19 difference between @xmath116 and @xmath117 is small , the difference grows with @xmath0 .",
    "for example , for @xmath118 and @xmath5 , @xmath119 and for @xmath117 , @xmath120 . based on this data , we speculate that for @xmath115 , @xmath1 depends on @xmath114 .",
    "a few comments on the technical aspects of the simulations are in order .",
    "we implement an upper cut - off on the levy steps so that at long enough times , the survival probability distribution approaches the random walker result  @xcite .",
    "the convergence also depends on the levy index .",
    "for example , for @xmath5 and stepsize cut - off @xmath121 , the convergence to the random walker result is fast such that the asymptote to a power - law beyond @xmath122 is in agreement with the random walker result to within one standard deviation .",
    "in contrast for @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and time scales beyond @xmath125 , convergence to the random walker result is observed .",
    "secondly , for @xmath5 we also generated cauchy distributed numbers directly and found good agreement with the power - law generated @xmath5 result .",
    "to summarize , we have generalized the vicious walker problem in two different ways : ( 1 ) vicious accelerating walkers and ( 2 ) vicious levy flights as defined by non - crossing . for both generalizations ,",
    "the typical analytical technique of the method of images fails .",
    "analytical results for @xmath28 are readily obtainable since both problems can be mapped to the first passage problem of a single accelerating walker or levy flight with the appropriate absorbing boundary or region .",
    "we demonstrate that the @xmath0 vicious walker mapping to one walker in @xmath99 dimensions in a wedge geometry generalizes to vicious accelerating walkers .",
    "we also conjecture , based on our numerical data , that there exists an upper bound on the survival probability exponent of @xmath126 for @xmath0 vicious accelerating walkers .",
    "an analytical calculation for the @xmath2 case corresponding to one acclerating walker in a two - dimensional wedge geometry would be the next logical step .",
    "the heuristic argument for the absorbing accelerating walker in one - dimension using a new time counter and levy flights may eventually become useful to analyze the two - dimensional wedge problem",
    ". there also exists a recent numerical result for the survival probability distribution for the two - dimensional fractional browian motion process , originally introduced by kolmogorov  @xcite , in a wedge  @xcite .",
    "we anticipate more study of non - markovian processes in dimensions higher than unity in the near future . indeed ,",
    "a non - markovian extension of dyson s brownian motion model to , for example , include inertia , may be related to @xmath0 vicious accelerating walkers to arrive at a new class of random matrices",
    ". it may also be interesting to investigate other ordering problems of randomly accelerating walkers on a line such as the gaussian equivalent of the  leader  and the  laggard",
    " problem  @xcite .    finally , given our numerical results , we speculate that the survival probability exponent for @xmath0 vicious levy flights ( as defined by no - crossing ) depends on @xmath114 for fixed @xmath115 .",
    "we also refer to a new result where vicious levy flights are defined as annihilating when any two levy flights come within some range of each other and @xmath1 depends on @xmath114 even for @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "while the survival probability exponent in one - dimension is independent of the levy index , as a consequence of the powerful sparre - andersen theorem , we anticipate that this superuniversality may be broken in dimensions higher than unity and the universality of each levy index becomes exposed . in light of our results , a higher dimensional generalization ( or modification ) of the sparre - andersen theorem should be on the forefront of at least several statistical physicists and mathematicians minds .",
