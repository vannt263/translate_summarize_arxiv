    "deep 2  mm observations of the macs  j1149.6 + 2223 cluster field with the goddard iram 2 millimeter observer ( gismo ) revealed a 2  mm source @xcite that was consistent with the position of the gravitationally lensed galaxy macs1149-jd located at @xmath0 @xcite . assuming the validity of this association",
    ", @xcite analyzed the dust formation and destruction rates that are unique to the very high redshift universe .",
    "an important general result of their study was that in high redshift galaxies with dust - to - gas mass ratios below a critical value of @xmath7 , and hence metallicities below @xmath8 , supernova are net producers of interstellar dust , so that the net rate of dust formation in such galaxies exceeds that in older , more metal - rich , objects .",
    "however , imaging from the herschel lensing survey @xcite indicated that the fir flux may instead originate from one of two galaxies at @xmath9 , also within the gismo 17.5  beam [ see cautionary note @xcite ] . follow up observations with the aztec 1.1  mm camera mounted on the large millimeter telescope _",

    "their observations detected a 3.5@xmath10 source consistent with the gismo position , associated with a group of galaxies located 11  away from macs1149-jd source .",
    "five sources with redshifts between 0.7 - 1.6 , that were detected in clash survey of this field @xcite , are within the aztec beam , preventing the definitive association of the gismo source with an individual galaxy .",
    "in this paper we present a 1.3  resolution image of the 33  @xmath11 33  field centered around macs1149-jd obtained at 1.3  mm with the noema .",
    "the image shows a 4@xmath10 source , located within the aztec beam , that is positively identified with clash  2882 , a galaxy at a redshift of 0.99 .",
    "we combine the gismo 2  mm observations with the uv - optical ( uvo ) to far - infrared ( ir ) and submillimeter observations to construct the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the stellar and dust emission components of the galaxy .",

    "given the importance of identifying the counterpart to the 2  mm gismo source , we targeted the field of macs1149-jd using the noema on december 30 , 2014 , and january 1 , 2015 ( program : w14fp , pi : staguhn ) .",

    "the spectral energy distribution comprises of three distinct contributions : thermal emission from dust at wavelengths above @xmath22  @xmath6 m ; an obscured stellar population from 0.4 to 2  @xmath6 m ; and a population of unobscured young blue stars from @xmath23 to 0.4  @xmath6 m .",
    "the fits to the dust and stellar components of the sed are described in the following subsections .",
    "we assumed that the mid - ir to submm emission arises from astronomical silicate and amorphous carbon ( ac ) grains , with optical constants given by @xcite .",
    "model parameters were the silicate and ac dust masses , @xmath24  and @xmath25 , and their respective temperatures , @xmath26  and @xmath27 .",
    "we varied dust masses from @xmath28 to @xmath29  @xmath3 , and solved for the dust temperatures that gave the best fits to observed ir fluxes , ignoring upper limits .",
    "the results of the fit are given in figure  [ specfits ] .",
    "the left column presents the fits to the sed , and the top left panel presents an unconstrained fit to the dust spectrum with silicate and ac dust masses and temperatures as free parameters .",
    "the mid to far ",
    "ir spectra are readily fit with 30  k silicate dust , however the steep @xmath30 falloff in the silicate emissivity failed to fit the millimeter fluxes .",
    "these were fit with a very cold , @xmath31  k , ac dust component .",
    "we consider this fit to be physically unrealistic , because of the large @xmath32  @xmath3  of ac dust needed to fit the spectrum , and the large disparity between the silicate and ac dust temperatures . exposed to a radiation field similar to that in the diffuse ism of the galaxy , ac dust will attain a somewhat higher temperature than that of the silicates , with a ratio of @xmath27/@xmath26@xmath33 @xcite .",
    "we therefore calculated the best fits to the far  ir mm spectrum , constraining the ac - to - silicate dust temperature to be 1.3 . to test the dependence of the derived dust masses and temperatures on this ratio , we also considered a dust model with a @xmath27/@xmath26  ratio of 2.0 .",
    "the resulting fits are shown in the left column of the second and third rows of the figure .",
    "the left panel in the last row presents the fit to the spectrum with a single ac dust component .",
    "the right column in the figure shows the maps ( figure ) of @xmath34  as a function of dust masses ( mass ) .",
    "when the temperatures of the different dust components are unconstrained ( top row of the figure ) , the best fit is obtained with hot silicate and very cold ac dust , radiating close to the lower limit of @xmath35  k imposed by the cosmic microwave background at that redshift . when the relative dust temperatures are constrained to more realistic values ( second and third rows ) , the @xmath34  maps show that the ac dust mass is well determined to be around @xmath36  @xmath3 , whereas the silicate mass can vary substantially without significantly affecting the goodness of the fit to the data .",
    "this is a direct result of the temperature constraints and the differences between the spectral behavior of the emissivity of the two dust components .",
    "because of its higher temperature , the ac dust provides a good fit to the sed at the shortest ir wavelengths , and dominates the emission at all other wavelengths .",
    "consequently its mass is well defined .",
    "the emission from the silicate dust component is only a secondary contributor to the observed sed , and its temperature decreases with increasing ac dust temperatures , in order to fit the long wavelength emission .",
    "the resulting 30% variation in silicate temperatures causes the mass of the silicate dust to vary by factors of 5 . in contrast , there is very little variation in the ac dust temperature ( @xmath37% ) resulting in less than a factor of 1.4 variation in their dust mass .",
    "overall , the minimum value of @xmath34  for all cases is around 16 with 3 degrees of freedom , which is formally a poor fit to the data .",
    "this is largely due to the fact that the 1.1 and 1.3  mm data points are inconsistent with a declining spectrum , and that the gismo  2  mm flux may contain the contribution of other galaxies from within the large beam .",
    "eliminating the 1.1 and 1.3  mm data points will reduce the value of @xmath34  to about 1.8 for 1 degree of freedom , which is a marginally acceptable fit to the data .",
    "dust masses , temperatures , and luminosities are presented in table  [ results1 ] .      to model the stellar emission component we adopted a star formation history ( sfh ) characterized by a delayed exponential function with a characteristic timescale @xmath38 of the form : @xmath39 which , normalized to a sfr of @xmath40 at time @xmath41 , can be written as : @xmath42\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the sfr at time @xmath43  gyr , the age of clash  2882  at @xmath14 .",
    "we used the population synthesis code pegas @xcite with a kroupa imf @xcite to calculate the intrinsic stellar spectrum , and adopted the calzetti attenuation law @xcite to calculate the stellar radiation that escapes the galaxy , and the radiation that is absorbed by the dust .",
    "the current sfr was determined from the total bolometric luminosity , and was found to be equal to @xmath44@xmath2  @xmath3  yr@xmath4 . a good fit to the observed stellar component was obtained for values of @xmath45  gyr , and @xmath46 .",
    "the values of the intrinsic stellar luminosity , @xmath47 , the escaping stellar luminosity , @xmath48 , and the stellar luminosity absorbed by the dust , @xmath49 , are listed in table  [ galx ] .",
    "the value of the absorbed stellar luminosity , @xmath50@xmath2  @xmath51 , is somewhat larger than the calculated ir luminosity , which is about @xmath52@xmath2  @xmath51 .",
    "the fractional difference of 18% is consistent with the missing luminosity from the mid  ir region , if clash  2882  had an arp220like sed . the warm dust that emits at mid ",
    "ir wavelengths makes a small contribution to the total ir luminosity , and a negligible one to the dust mass .",
    "the stellar emission component is therefore consistent with the dust emission component .",
    "the rising stellar sed in the @xmath53  @xmath6 m  region was modeled by a 100  myr burst , with a sfr of 4  @xmath3  yr@xmath4 .",
    "the total burst luminosity and stellar mass are also listed in table  [ galx ] .",
    "the specific sfr ( ssfr ) , defined as @xmath54 , is equal to @xmath55  yr@xmath4 , or equivalently , the specific timescale for star formation , @xmath56 , defined as the inverse quantity , is equal to 2.3  gyr .",
    "the value of the ssfr is larger than that expected from a galaxy with a stellar mass of @xmath57@xmath2  @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the value of @xmath56 is much shorter than the age of the galaxy , suggesting that most stars formed in a recent episode of star formation .",
    "the mass of dust in galaxies is determined by the rates of dust injection into the ism by agb stars and core collapse supernovae ( ccsn ) , and by their destruction rate by supernova remnants ( snrs)in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and can be calculated by detailed evolutionary models , such as those presented by @xcite and @xcite . if the sfr has been constant over the lifetime of the dust , @xmath58",
    ", then the equilibrium dust mass dust mass is given by : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is death rate of the dust producing sources @xmath61 \\{agb , ccsn } , and @xmath62 is their average dust yield .",
    "the dust lifetime is given by @xcite : @xmath63 where @xmath64  is the total mass of ism gas , @xmath65 is the effective mass of gas that is completely cleared of dust by a single snr , and @xmath66  is the rate of core collapse and type  ia sne .",
    "the equilibrium dust mass can then be explicitly written as : @xmath67\\ , \\left({{m _ { \\rm   ism}}\\over m_g}\\right)\\ ] ] the @xmath68@xmath66  ratios depend only on the stellar imf so that given a dust yield in the different stellar sources , the equilibrium dust mass primarily depends on the available ism mass , and the mass of gas cleared of dust by each snr .",
    "the ratio of type ia to ccsn in the solar neighborhood is about 0.20 @xcite giving an @xmath69/@xmath66  ratio of 0.8 . for a kroupa imf ,",
    "the death rate of low mass carbon stars is 6 times higher than the total sn rate , giving @xmath70/@xmath66  @xmath71 .    for simplicity we will assume that all the silicate dust is produced in ccsn with average yields of 0.1  @xmath3 , based on observations of the crab nebula and cas  a @xcite .",
    "carbon dust is made in the outflows from agb stars in the 1.4 to 4.0  @xmath3  mass range , with average yields of @xmath72  @xmath3@xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath65 was recently calculated for a range of ism densities , interstellar magnetic field intensities , and sn explosion energies , and found to be @xmath73  @xmath3 , depending on these values @xcite .",
    "so the equilibrium dust mass in galaxies is approximately given by : @xmath74    if we use an ism mass of @xmath75  @xmath3  for the milky way , then the equilibrium dust mass is only @xmath76  @xmath3 , considerably lower than the @xmath77  @xmath3  inferred from dust models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this discrepancy reflects the fact we only considered stellar sources of interstellar dust , while detailed chemical evolution models suggest that most of the galactic dust must have been reconstituted in the dense ism @xcite .    the ism mass in clash  2882  is unknown , but if we adopt the stellar mass of @xmath78  @xmath3  as an upper limit on the gas mass , then the upper limit on the equilibrium dust mass becomes @xmath79@xmath2  @xmath3 , a factor of at least 5 times lower than that derived from fitting the far - ir emission , independent of the lensing magnification .",
    "the underlying reason for this discrepancy is that the dust production rates in stellar sources ( ccsne and agb stars ) are significantly lower than their destruction rates by snr in the ism .",
    "the situation in clash  2882  is therefore similar to that in the milky way , and the magellanic clouds and other external galaxies , in which the dust production rates are significantly lower than their destruction rates @xcite .",
    "a significantly lower destruction efficiency is required to balance the dust production and destruction rates in the ism .",
    "alternatively , grain growth by accretion onto the cores of surviving grains , as originally suggested for the milky way @xcite , may be an additional source of interstellar dust in clash  2882 .",
    "clash  2882  is a star forming galaxy at @xmath80 with a current sfr of 54@xmath2  @xmath3  yr@xmath4 , a total stellar mass of @xmath78@xmath2  @xmath3 , a ssfr of @xmath81  yr@xmath4 , and a total dust mass of @xmath82@xmath2  @xmath3 , where the mean value of @xmath6 is 2.7 .",
    "the inferred dust mass is higher than the upper limit on the equilibrium dust mass from stellar sources .",
    "similarly to many other star forming galaxies , the dust mass in clash  2882  can not be accounted for by formation in ccsn and agb stars , requiring the need to grow most of the dust in the dense phases of the ism .",
