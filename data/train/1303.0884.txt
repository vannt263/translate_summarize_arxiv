    "decades ago , elliptical galaxies were thought to contain very little , if any , gas .",
    "studies of galaxy formation , therefore , often focussed on the stellar properties , however we now know that a large fraction of the baryonic mass in massive galaxies is believe to be in diffuse form .",
    "thus a complete view of galaxy formation and evolution necessarily incorporates both the stars and hot gas and an understanding of the processes by which these phases interact ( mccarthy et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "cooling - flow clusters are common in the local universe and massive central cluster galaxies ( ccgs ) are often found at the centres of these systems ( peres et al .",
    "if the central cluster density is high enough , intracluster gas can condense and form stars at the bottom of the potential well .",
    "since the radiative cooling times for intracluster gas are short enough that gas can cool and settle to the cluster centre ( edge , stewart @xmath4 fabian 1992 ) , it has been suggested that the big envelopes of ccgs may arise from the gradual deposition of this cool gas .",
    "more recently , high spectral resolution _",
    "xmm - newton _ observations showed that the x - ray gas in cluster centres does not cool significantly below a threshold temperature of @xmath5 kev ( jordn et al .",
    "2004 , and references therein ) .",
    "this initially contradicted the model that these young stars are formed in cooling flows .",
    "however , it is possible that star formation is ongoing in cool - core clusters at a much reduced rate ( bildfell et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "previous studies have reported several examples of ongoing star formation in ccgs , in particular those hosted by cooling - flow clusters ( cardiel , gorgas @xmath4 aragn - salamanca 1998 ; crawford et al .",
    "1999 ; mcnamara et al .  2006 ; edwards et al .  2007 ; odea et al .",
    "2008 ; bildfell et al .",
    "2008 ; pipino et al .",
    "2009 ; loubser et al .",
    "however , the origin of the gas fuelling this star formation is not yet known .",
    "possible explanations include processes involving cooling flows or cold gas deposited during a merging event ( bildfell et al .",
    "these processes will leave different imprints in the dynamical properties , the detailed chemical abundances , and the star formation histories of these galaxies , which can be studied using high - quality spectroscopy ( loubser et al . 2008 ; 2009 ; 2012 ) .",
    "observations that support this idea are blue- and ultraviolet - colour ( uv - colour ) excesses observed ( indicative of star formation ) in the central galaxy of abell 1795 by mcnamara et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and molecular gas detected in 10 out of 32 central cluster galaxies by salom @xmath4 combes ( 2003 ) . the observations by cardiel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) were consistent with an evolutionary sequence in which star formation bursts , triggered by radio sources , take place several times during the lifetime of the cooling flow in the centre of the cluster . however ,",
    "mcnamara @xmath4 oconnell ( 1992 ) found only colour anomalies with small amplitudes , implying star formation rates that account for at most a few percent of the material that is cooling and accreting onto the central galaxy . cooling - flow models for ccg formation also imply the formation of larger numbers of new stars , for which there is no good observational evidence ( athanassoula , garijo @xmath4 garca - gmez 2001 ) .",
    "the central cluster galaxies often host radio - loud agn which may account for the necessary heating to counteract radiative cooling ( von der linden et al .",
    "2007 ) .    in summary , cooling flow models predict more cooled gas than is observed ( bohringer et al .",
    "thus , it is possible that the mass deposited into the molecular clouds is heated by one of several processes - hot young stellar populations , radio - loud agn , x - rays or heat conduction from the intracluster medium itself , shocks and turbulent mixing layers , and cosmic rays .",
    "therefore , only a small fraction of the cooled gas is detected ( crawford et al . 2005 ; ferland et al .",
    "thus , ccgs lie at the interface where it is crucial to understand the role of feedback and accretion in star formation . within these cooling - flow ccgs , cool",
    "molecular clouds , warm ionized hydrogen , and the cooling intracluster medium are related . a complete view of the star formation process incorporates the stars with the gas and an understanding of the processes by which these phases interact , and therefore , requires information from several wavelength regimes .",
    "in conclusion , although ccgs are probably not completely formed in cooling flows , the flows play an important role in regulating the rate at which gas cools at the centres of groups and clusters . in the @xmath6cdm cosmology",
    "it is now understood that local massive haloes assemble late through the merging of smaller systems . in this picture ,",
    "cooling flows seem to be the main fuel for galaxy mass growth at high redshift .",
    "this source is removed only at low redshifts in group or cluster environments , due to agn feedback ( de lucia @xmath4 blaizot 2007 ; voit et al .",
    "indeed , if agn feedback is not properly assumed in hydrodynamical simulations , an apparently bluer bcg is formed as a result of an accelerated late stellar birthrate even after the epoch of quiescent star formation ( romeo et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "we proposed and obtained ifu observations of the central few kiloparsecs of the ionised nebulae in active ccgs in cooling - flow clusters .",
    "these observations will map the morphology , kinematics and ionisation state of the nebulae to gain an understanding of their formation , heating and relationship to the cluster centre .",
    "we selected galaxies from the mcdonald et al .",
    "( 2010 ) study , which consisted of an h@xmath0 survey of 23 cooling flow clusters . amongst their conclusions ,",
    "mcdonald , veilleux @xmath4 rupke ( 2012 ) find a stong correlation between the h@xmath0 luminosity contained in filaments and the x - ray cooling flow rate of the cluster , suggesting that the warm , ionised gas is linked to the cooling flow .",
    "we chose objects with confirmed extended h@xmath0 emission , and with near - ir ( 2mass ) , ultraviolet ( galex ) , x - ray data ( chandra ) , and in some cases vla 1.4 ghz fluxes , already available ( mcdonald et al .",
    "detailed properties of the host clusters , which are reported to influence the activity in the central galaxy , such as central cooling times and the offset between the cluster x - ray peak and the central galaxy , have been derived .",

    "( 2010 ) presented ifu observations of one nearby bcg showing liner - like emission , and brough et al .",
    "( 2011 ) presented ifu data on four ccgs at z @xmath7 to calculate the dynamical masses of ccgs and measure their stellar angular momentum ( although none of their four ccgs contained emission lines ) .",

    "edwards et al .",
    "( 2009 ) presents ifu observations of nine ccgs in cooling and non - cooling clusters ( also from crawford et al .",
    "1999 ) and within 50 kpc of the x - ray centre , with gmos ifu and oasis on wht ( most galaxies with wavelength ranges also limited to the h@xmath0 region , but three also included h@xmath2 ) .",
    "emission line maps of morphology , kinematics , often line ratios , and the stellar continuum have been published for abell 496 by hatch et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and for abell 2052 by edwards et al .",
    "these studies concluded that no proposed heating mechanism reproduces all the emission - line properties within their observed wavelength within a single source .",
    "thus , a single dominant mechanism may not apply to all ccg nebulae , and there may be a mixture of heating mechanisms acting within a single nebula ( wilman , edge @xmath4 swinbank 2006 ; hatch et al .  2007 ) .",
    "thus to get more information which will enable the dominant mechanism(s ) to be identified , we observed more line ratios over a longer wavelength range ( around h@xmath0 and h@xmath2 which also allowed extinction to be appropriately measured ) .",
    "we will be adding the detailed stellar population analysis , and place the derived information from the optical spectra in context with multiwavelength data over the full spectrum in a future paper , to explain the diverse nature of these galaxies .",
    "all the data for abell 780 and 1644 is new , and all four of the extinction maps are new . also , the construction of ionisation diagrams and analysis of ionisation processes with shock models and pagb models is also new .",
    "our exposure times ( improved from previous studies ) are shown in table [ table : objects ] .",
    "this data is also complimentary to the long - slit spectroscopy ( on keck and magellan ) along the h@xmath0 filaments of the four objects ( studied here ) by mcdonald et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .",
    "we introduce the sample and detail of the data reductions in sections [ sample ] and [ reduction ] .",
    "we then derive the optical extinction as well as the line strengths in section [ extinction ] .",
    "we proceed to discuss the four individual cases in section [ figures_nvss ] , and identify the mechanism producing the emission and the ionised gas in these four ccgs in section [ ionisation ] .",
    "we summarise the findings of this paper in [ summary ] .",
    "we have used the following set of cosmological parameters : @xmath8 = 0.3 , @xmath9 = 0.7 , h@xmath10 = 70 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 .",
    "[ fig : thumbnails ]    we have chosen our sample of active central cluster galaxies from the h@xmath0 imaging presented in mcdonald et al .",

    "mcdonald et al .",
    "( 2010 ) enforced the cuts : @xmath12 and @xmath13 , after which they selected 23 clusters to cover the full range of properties , from very rich clusters with high cooling rates to low - density clusters with small cooling flows .",
    "their classical cooling rates range from 6.3  431 m@xmath14 yr@xmath11 which means that while covering a large range in properties , their sample consisted of only cooling flow clusters . from their 23 cooling flow clusters , we selected all the clusters with clearly detected h@xmath0 in their centres ( albeit filamentary , extended or nuclear emission ) .",
    "in addition , all of these central galaxies have optical imaging , near - ir ( 2mass ) and uv ( galex data ) available .",
    "thereafter , we selected all the central galaxies with detailed x - ray ( chandra ) data , as well as vla 1.4 ghz fluxes , available .",
    "this resulted in a sub - sample of 10 galaxies .",
    "we observed four of these galaxies with the gmos ifu ( as shown in figure [ fig : thumbnails ] ) .",
    "we merely chose the objects with the most auxiliary information available .",
    "this additional information will be added in the future paper ( where the underlying stellar populations will be analysed in detail ) and might help to constrain the ionisation mechanisms .",
    "the rest - wavelength range of the emission lines of interest is 48606731  ( h@xmath2 to [ sii]@xmath16731 ) .",
    "the ratio of the forbidden [ nii]@xmath16584 to h@xmath0 line will depend on the metallicity of the gas , the form of the ionising radiation , and the star formation rate .",
    "the relative strength of the [ oiii]@xmath15007 and h@xmath2 lines reveals further excitation mechanism and gas metallicity information .",
    "the role of agn photoionisation is confined to the central 2  3 \" of active , massive nearby elliptical galaxies ( sarzi et al .",
    "thus , ifu observations are ideal and will also allow us to study the 2d - distribution of the ionising radiation .",
    "in addition to the information from the emission lines , we are able to extract the underlying stellar absorption spectra using the improved gandalf code ( sarzi et al . 2006 ) .",
    "thus , the kinematics and morphology of the hot ionised gas and stellar components can be correlated .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     some ellipticals contain dust in the centre that can be patchy , uniform or filamentary ( laine et al .",
    "the long wavelength range of the spectra allows us to constrain the amount of reddening using the observed decrement of the balmer lines , which can be set to have an intrinsic decrement consistent with the recombination theory by treating the lines as a multiplet .",
    "the physical constraints on the emission from the higher - order balmer lines also ensures the strength of the corresponding absorption features is correctly estimated .",
    "we used the dust models by calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to calculate the flux attenuation values at the desired wavelength for any given @xmath15 value ( optional see below ) .",
    "the balmer decrement assumes a case b recombination for a density of 100 @xmath16 and a temperature of 10@xmath17 k , resulting in the predicted h@xmath0/h@xmath2 ratio of 2.86 ( osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "the code can adopt either a single dust component , affecting both the stellar continuum and the emission - line fluxes , or in addition include a second dust component that affects only the emission - line templates .",
    "we did not specify galactic extinction ( from the ned database , schlegel , finkbeiner @xmath4 davis 1998 ) , but we measured a total diffuse component which gave the total extinction ( hence including the foreground galactic extinction ) .",
    "this total extinction measured from the balmer decrement are shown in figure [ fig : mcg_extinct ] and averages are noted in table [ table : objects2 ] ( the galactic extinction noted in table [ table : objects2 ] was not subtracted ) .",
    "the extinction was smoothed over 0.3 arcseconds , and is only plotted where the velocity dispersion of the h@xmath0 line is less than 500 km s@xmath11 ( to avoid spaxels where the h@xmath0 line could not be separated from the [ nii ] lines ) , and it is only plotted where the amplitude - to - noise ( a / n ) ratio of the h@xmath0 line is higher than 3 ( as defined in sarzi et al .  2006 ) where @xmath18 is the equivalent width of the line , and",
    "@xmath19 is the line width . ] .",
    "the a / n maps of the h@xmath0 measurements are shown in section [ figures_nvss ] which gives a direct indication of the errors on the extinction .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 , i.e.  the colour excess between 4350  and 5550  , for the galactic extinction for each of the four galaxies was taken from the ned database ( schlegel et a.  1998 ) , and ranged between 0.037 and 0.140 mag ( table [ table : objects2 ] ) .",
    "the parameter r@xmath20 , i.e.  the ratio of the absolute extinction at 5550  ( a@xmath20 ) to the colour excess @xmath15 , was taken as 3.1 for the interstellar medium ( cardelli , clayton @xmath4 mathis 1989 ) .",
    "the total extinction is given by :    @xmath21    the theoretical h@xmath0/h@xmath2 flux ratio of 2.86 may not be the ideal value to use for seyfert - type galaxies , but the actual value is debated .",
    "it is often assumed that the h@xmath0 emission in these systems is enhanced due to collisional processes , and several authors use a value @xmath22 of 3.1 ( gaskell @xmath4 ferland 1984 ; osterbrock @xmath4 ferland 2006 ) , although other values have also been determined ( binette et al .  1990 calculate a value of 3.4 ) .",
    "the total extinction maps are presented in figure [ fig : mcg_extinct ] , and shows mostly very low extinction , but some morphological features can be seen in mcg-02 - 12 - 039 and ugc09799 .",

    "<S> we present detailed integral field unit ( ifu ) observations of the central few kiloparsecs of the ionised nebulae surrounding four active central cluster galaxies ( ccgs ) in cooling flow clusters ( abell 0496 , 0780 , 1644 and 2052 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our sample consists of ccgs with h@xmath0 filaments , and have existing data from the x - ray regime available . here , we present the detailed optical emission - line ( and simultaneous absorption line ) data over a broad wavelength range to probe the dominant ionisation processes , excitation sources , morphology and kinematics of the hot gas ( as well as the morphology and kinematics of the stars ) . </S>",
    "<S> this , combined with the other multiwavelength data , will form a complete view of the different phases ( hot and cold gas and stars ) and how they interact in the processes of star formation and feedback detected in central galaxies in cooling flow clusters , as well as the influence of the host cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the optical dust extinction maps of the four nebulae . </S>",
    "<S> we also derive a range of different kinematic properties , given the small sample size . for abell 0496 and 0780 </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the stars and gas are kinematically decoupled , and in the case of abell 1644 we find that these components are aligned . for abell 2052 </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the gaseous components show rotation even though no rotation is apparent in the stellar components . to the degree that our spatial resolution reveals </S>",
    "<S> , it appears that all the optical forbidden and hydrogen recombination lines originate in the same gas for all the galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> based on optical diagnostic ratios ( [ oiii]@xmath15007/h@xmath2 against [ nii]@xmath16584/h@xmath0 , [ sii]@xmath36717,6731/h@xmath0 , and [ oi]@xmath16300/h@xmath0 ) , all galaxies show extended liner emission , but that at least one has significant seyfert emission areas , and at least one other has significant hii like emission line ratios for many pixels . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the hardness of the ionising continuum do not decrease with galactocentric distance within our field - of - view ( with the exception of one galaxy that show a core separation ) as the emission line ratios do not vary significantly with radius . </S>",
    "<S> this also indicates that the derived nebular properties are spatially homogeneous . </S>",
    "<S> we fit agn and pagb stars photoionisation models as well as shock excitation models to our derived diagnostic ratios . </S>",
    "<S> these fits , combined with information from multiwavelength studies reveal that agn photoionisation is the most likely ionisation mechanism in at least two cases even though shocks and pagb stars can not be conclusively eliminated .    </S>",
