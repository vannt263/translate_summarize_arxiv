    "galaxies grow partly by accretion of gas from the surrounding intergalactic medium and partly by mergers with other galaxies .",
    "observational studies of galaxy assembly have focused primarily on merger rates , which can be measured indirectly by counting close pairs and merger remnants .",
    "however , all the mass that enters the galaxy population ultimately does so by accretion  mergers can only redistribute this mass from smaller systems to larger systems .",
    "furthermore , numerical simulations predict that even large galaxies grow primarily by smooth gas accretion rather than by cannibalism of smaller objects @xcite .",
    "gas shock - heated to the virial temperature of a typical dark matter halo would radiate most of its acquired gravitational energy in the soft x - ray continuum , making individual sources very difficult to detect , especially at high redshift",
    ". however , fardal et al .",
    "( @xcite , hereafter f01 ) show that much of the gas that enters galaxies in hydrodynamic cosmological simulations never heats to high temperatures at all , and that it therefore channels a substantial fraction of its cooling radiation into atomic emission lines , especially ly@xmath4 .",
    "f01 and @xcite suggested that extended `` ly@xmath4  blobs '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with typical sizes of @xmath10 and line luminosities @xmath11 , might be signatures of cooling radiation from forming galaxies .",
    "@xcite have also investigated predictions for ly@xmath4   cooling radiation from forming galaxies in hydrodynamic simulations .    in this paper , we investigate other aspects of cooling radiation from forming galaxies , in particular the potentially detectable radiation in the @xmath3  ( `` ly@xmath4 '' ) and @xmath2  ( `` h@xmath4 '' ) lines of singly ionized helium .",
    "while challenging , the successful detection line emission would complement ly@xmath4  measurements in at least three ways .",
    "first , because and line cooling rates peak at different temperatures ( @xmath12 vs. @xmath13 ) , measurements of both lines could constrain the physical conditions of the emitting gas .",
    "recent theoretical studies imply that `` cold mode '' accretion , in which the maximum gas temperature is well below the halo virial temperature , is a ubiquitous and fundamental feature of galaxy formation ( f01 ; @xcite ) , a view anticipated by the early analytical work of @xcite .",
    "simultaneous measurements of and emission from different types of galaxies could eventually test detailed predictions for the temperature distribution of cooling gas .",
    "the second advantage of the @xmath2  line is that it should be optically thin , allowing a straightforward interpretation of the observed emission in terms of the spatial distribution and kinematics of the cooling gas .",
    "in contrast , the radiative transfer effects on the ly@xmath4  emission from accreting gas are more complicated , an issue that we will investigate in future work ( j.  kollmeier et al . , in preparation ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "third , the different temperature dependence and absence of radiative transfer effects in lines could help distinguish cooling radiation from alternative explanations of `` ly@xmath4  blobs , '' such as emission from collisionally ionized gas in galactic superwinds @xcite or from gas photoionized by young stellar populations .",
    "for example , only the lowest metallicity stars ( @xmath14 ) have hard enough spectra to ionize to , so stellar photoionization will generally not produce line emission .",
    "it is possible that cooling emission from forming galaxies at high redshift has already been detected .",
    "one such example is the broad @xmath2  line in the composite spectrum of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) from @xcite .",
    "the composite line shows a rather broad line width ( fwhm@xmath15 1500 km s@xmath16 ) , which is a possible signature of wolf - rayet stars .",
    "however , it is difficult to reproduce the strength of the line via stellar population models with reasonable parameters @xcite .",
    "we show in this paper that the cooling emission around individual galaxies is detectable , which suggests it might be fruitful to search for @xmath2  cooling emission in the outer parts of individual lbg s .",
    "the next section describes our simulations and the radiative cooling mechanisms that lead to @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3  line emission .",
    "we present @xmath1  and @xmath2  cooling maps in  [ sec : map ] and discuss the properties of the cooling radiation sources in  [ sec : properties ] . in  [ sec : detectability ] , we examine the detectability of the three major cooling lines in the far ultraviolet and optical and discuss the best observational strategies . in  [ sec : dis ] , we discuss mechanisms other than gravitational cooling radiation that can generate extended ly@xmath4  emission and describe how the cooling line might help us discriminate among those mechanisms .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we use parallel treesph simulations @xcite including the effects of radiative cooling , star formation , thermal feedback , and a spatially uniform metagalactic photoionizing background .",
    "we analyze two simulations : one with a cubic volume of @xmath17 mpc ( comoving ) on a side and a spatial resolution of @xmath18 kpc ( comoving ; equivalent plummer softening ) , the other with a cubic volume of @xmath19 mpc on a side and @xmath20 kpc resolution .",
    "hereafter , we refer to these two simulations as the 11 mpc and 22 mpc simulations , respectively .",
    "the simulations consist of @xmath21 dark matter particles and @xmath21 gas particles , giving a mass resolution of @xmath22 and @xmath23 for the 11 mpc simulation , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 for the 22 mpc simulation .",
    "we adopt a @xmath26cdm cosmology with the parameters @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 . in our calculation of cooling emission lines",
    ", we basically follow the radiative cooling processes described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter kwh ) . here , we briefly summarize the cooling processes that can contribute to line emission .",
    "the four underlying assumptions of radiative cooling are : primordial composition , ionization equilibrium , an optically thin gas , and a spatially uniform radiation field . in the simulations ,",
    "we adopt @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the hydrogen and helium abundance by mass .",
    "the abundances of each ionic species ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) are solely determined by assuming that the primordial plasma is optically thin and in ionization equilibrium ( but not in thermal equilibrium ) .",
    "the functional forms of the temperature - dependent recombination rates , collisional ionization rates , collisional excitation rates , and the rate equations are given in  3 of kwh and the tables therein .",
    "the uniform photoionizing uv background is taken from @xcite .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe the ly@xmath4  and cooling curves under the optically thin gas assumption , the assumption used in our simulations .",
    "however , in the high density regime , a gas cloud becomes dense enough to shield the central part of itself from the uv background , i.e. , becomes self - shielded .",
    "therefore , the actual emissivity of this self - shielded ( or condensed phase ) gas is highly uncertain .",
    "we discuss below how to treat this phase of the igm to derive better estimates of the cooling radiation .",
    "once we generate the ly@xmath4  and cooling emissivities , the cooling radiation is determined by how many gas particles populate a certain range of temperature and density , where we appeal to the high - resolution cosmological simulations mentioned above .      among the various radiative cooling processes ,",
    "only two can produce ly@xmath4  ( 1216 ) , ly@xmath4  ( 340 ) , and balmer @xmath4 ( 1640 ) photons : the recombination cascades of a free electron and the collisional excitation of a bound electron to an excited state followed by radiative decay .",
    "the dominant cooling mechanism is the collisional excitation of neutral hydrogen and singly ionized helium , which have their peaks at temperatures of @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : cooling ] shows the @xmath1  and @xmath3  emissivities for gas of different densities in ionization equilibrium in the presence of a metagalactic photoionizing background .",
    "the dashed lines represent the collisional excitation cooling lines of neutral hydrogen and singly ionized helium .",
    "the dot - dashed lines and dotted lines denote the recombination lines for these two species due to photoionization and collisional ionization , respectively .",
    "the solid lines represent the total ly@xmath4  cooling rates of hydrogen and helium . below @xmath42 , collisions with free electrons are not energetic enough to raise bound electrons to upper levels or to ionize the neutral hydrogen , so the collisional cooling rate of hydrogen drops quickly below this temperature . for singly ionized helium , the collisional cooling rate drops to virtually zero below @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , below @xmath42 , photoionization by the background uv spectrum ( heating ) and the following recombination ( cooling ) is the dominant source for cooling line emission of the primordial plasma .    in the presence of photoionization ,",
    "the cooling curve depends on the density as shown in figure [ fig : cooling ] , because the equilibrium abundances of each species depend on the density . while the collisional ionization rate per unit volume scales as @xmath44 , the photoionization rate per volume is proportional to only @xmath45 . in low density gas ( @xmath46 ) , a significant fraction of and is photoionized and their abundances are mainly determined by the photoionization process , so the collisional excitation feature is relatively weak .",
    "as the gas density increases ( @xmath47 ) , however , collisional excitation becomes more important and the cooling curves approach pure collisional equilibrium , the so - called coronal equilibrium .",
    "the notable difference between the cooling curves of hydrogen and singly ionized helium is that the cooling rates of owing to photoionization become significantly weaker as the gas density increases .",
    "if we assume that the medium is optically thin to the ionizing background  i.e. , not self - shielded  hydrogen is almost fully ionized over the entire temperature range even at high densities , but @xmath1590% of the helium is in a singly ionized state below @xmath48 at high densities .",
    "thus the assumption that the gas is optically thin everywhere is roughly valid for the calculation of the line fluxes , while it is poor for hydrogen .",
    "the correction for the self - shielding of hydrogen will be discussed in the next section .",
    "we estimate the @xmath2  flux from the @xmath3  flux by considering the ratio of @xmath2  to @xmath3  in the recombination cascades and in the collisional excitations , respectively .",
    "the thick solid lines below the cooling curves in figure [ fig : cooling ] represent our estimate of the @xmath2  line emissivity . below @xmath49 , the optical depth of @xmath3",
    "is so large that case - b recombination is a good approximation .",
    "even though the ly@xmath4  optical depth is extremely large , the population of the @xmath50 and @xmath51 states is always much smaller than that of the @xmath52 state , because the de - excitation time for level transitions is very short ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "one might be concerned whether the population of the @xmath51 state is large because of the forbidden transition ( @xmath54 ) , but the two photon decay process is fast enough to de - populate @xmath51 electrons ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "therefore , balmer lines are always optically thin .",
    "we adopt @xmath56 by extrapolating the case - b values of @xcite to the low density limit . for collisional excitation",
    ", we estimate the @xmath2  flux using @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the collisional excitation rate from the @xmath59 to the @xmath60 state .",
    "we adopt the @xmath58 s from @xcite .",
    "@xmath61 is roughly @xmath62 in the temperature range of @xmath63 where @xmath3  collisional excitation cooling is dominant . in summary ,",
    "the @xmath2  flux is calculated by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the recombination rate into @xmath66 states of , and by assuming @xmath67 and @xmath68 .      a major difference between our work and that of @xcite is that our simulations include a uniform uv background radiation field ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "however , because even state - of - art cosmological simulations like ours do not include radiative transfer , the self - shielded phase of the gas at high column densities is not treated properly . when the gas is heated to high temperature ( @xmath69 ) by falling into the forming galaxy s halo , the gas is mostly ionized , so it is reasonable to assume that the gas is optically thin to the uniform uv background .",
    "subsequently , when the gas cloud starts losing its thermal energy via cooling radiation , its neutral column density becomes sufficiently high that the metagalactic uv radiation can not penetrate the surrounding gas , and the cloud becomes self - shielded .",
    "once the supply of ionizing photons is shut off , what happens to the self - shielded high column density clouds ?",
    "first , the ionization states will achieve collisional ionization equilibrium , where the emissivity is determined solely by collisional ionization and collisional excitation .",
    "second , because the cooling emissivity is boosted by these processes , the self - shielded cloud will cool more rapidly to @xmath70 than in the presence of heating by ionizing photons .",
    "below this temperature , the subsequent cooling is dominated by metal lines ( if there are metals ) .",
    "stars ultimately form from this cold gas .    because our simulations do not include the time evolution of the self - shielded gas or metal - line cooling , it is not clear how long the gas particles stay in the self - shielded phase and emit in collisional ionization equilibrium .",
    "the ly@xmath4  emissivities shown in figure [ fig : cooling ] become unreliable in this self - shielded regime .",
    "thus we apply a _ pseudo _ self - shielding correction to the high density gas particles to correct their emissivities .",
    "this correction is not rigorous ; to properly calculate the emissivity of the self - shielded phase of the igm , one should incorporate a radiative transfer calculation that includes non - uniform and anisotropic uv radiation fields .",
    "a different prescription for the self - shielded phase is definitely possible .",
    "for example , @xcite consider two extreme cases : 1 ) adopting zero emissivity and 2 ) using the collisional ionization equilibrium emissivity for the self - shielded phase .",
    "our self - shielding correction scenario described below lies between these two extremes .",
    "to apply the self - shielding correction , we first define the `` local '' optical depth for each gas particle , @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the number densities and the photoionization cross sections of each species ( h@xmath74 , he@xmath74 , he@xmath75 ) , respectively .",
    "the `` local '' size of the gas cloud @xmath76  the length that corresponds to the volume that the gas particle would occupy in space  is defined as @xmath77 .",
    "such that @xmath78 represents the effective geometrical edge - to - center distance of the gas cloud .",
    "for example , @xmath79 is given for a single spherical gas cloud , whereas @xmath80 corresponds to the clumping of @xmath81 gas particles .",
    "the value of @xmath4 should vary from one particle to another , but we adopt @xmath82 throughout the paper as a fiducial value .",
    "the over - density where the self - shielding occurs also depends on the choice of the edge - to - center distance @xmath78 ( and on the redshift ) . however , we find that the effects of adopting @xmath83 is insignificant . ] for each gas particle , the uv background spectrum @xmath84 is attenuated using this local optical depth , i.e. @xmath85 , and new photoionization / heating rates and equilibrium number densities are calculated .",
    "we then determine a new @xmath86 from these values and iterate this procedure until the photoionization rates and the optical depths converge .",
    "we use these final ionization / heating rates to calculate the ly@xmath4  and emissivity of each gas particle .",
    "this modified emissivity for each gas particle is what we will refer to as the _ self - shielding correction case_.    in figure [ fig : tau ] , we show the local optical depths of each gas particle in the final equilibrium state as a function of over - density .",
    "for the 22 mpc simulation at @xmath87 , we show @xmath88 ( ) and @xmath88 ( ) , the optical depth at the ( 13.6 ev ) and ( 54.4 ev ) ionization edges , respectively . as indicated by the dotted lines , the optical depth increases abruptly from @xmath89 to @xmath90 at @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , the optically thin uv background assumption is valid below @xmath91 , but the gas becomes self - shielded quickly above this over - density . because the transition from the optically thin case to the self - shielded phase occurs abruptly , we also consider the emissivity of a _ condensed phase cut _ case as the most conservative for the cooling radiation .",
    "there we set the emissivity of the self - shielded gas particles to zero .",
    "hence , in the following analyses , we consider three possibilities . first is the _ optically thin case _ that assumes a spatially uniform uv background for every gas particle .",
    "second is the _ self - shielding corrected case _ described above that uses an attenuated uv background for each gas particle appropriate for the local optical depth .",
    "third is the _ condensed phase cut case _ where we set the emissivity of gas with @xmath92 and @xmath93 to zero .",
    "we emphasize again that while none of these possibilities are rigorously correct , they range from the most optimistic ( 1 ) to the most conservative case ( 3 ) .",
    "note again that case ( 1 ) is appropriate for , but the full range of cases should be considered for .",
    "+      we generate @xmath1  and @xmath2  cooling maps at @xmath94 2 and 3 by applying our line emissivities to each pixel element and integrating them along the line of sight . the temperature and density of each volume element",
    "is computed using the usual sph smoothing kernels , and the abundances of ionic species are calculated from these smoothed quantities . the thickness of the 11 mpc simulation along the line of sight is @xmath95 and @xmath96 for @xmath87 and @xmath97 , respectively .",
    "we convert these cooling maps into surface brightness maps using our adopted cosmology .",
    "figure [ fig : maps : z3 ] shows the @xmath1  and @xmath2cooling maps for the 11 mpc simulation at @xmath98 .",
    "we show the cooling maps for the condensed phase cut case to represent the most conservative prediction .",
    "the left panels show a part ( @xmath99 ) of our simulation where the filamentary structure of the igm  the so - called `` cosmic web ''  is evident . in the middle panels ,",
    "we show the brightest region ( also the most over - dense region for @xmath98 ) at a finer pixel scale ( @xmath100kpc per pixel ; half of the spatial resolution of our simulation ) .",
    "the right panels show the cooling maps convolved with a 05 fwhm gaussian filter to mimic a typical ground - based observation .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : maps : z3 ] , the ly@xmath4  cooling emission from the igm is somewhat extended above a surface brightness threshold of @xmath101 ( the current limit of ground - based detections ) , whereas the emission will be seen almost as a point source .",
    "we will refer to these extended ly@xmath4  cooling sources in our simulations as ly@xmath4  blobs hereafter . in the cooling maps ,",
    "we include only ly@xmath4  emission from the igm , not from star formation ( i.e. from photoionization caused by massive stars followed by recombination ) . however , we find a compact group of stars and/or star - forming particles , i.e. , galaxies , at the center of each ly@xmath4  blob .",
    "therefore , what we would actually observe are galaxies ( or ly@xmath4  emitters if dust absorption is negligible ) embedded within the ly@xmath4  blobs .",
    "the most uncertain factor in generating the cooling maps is how much the self - shielded gas contributes to the emission . to quantify this factor globally in the simulations",
    ", we consider the @xmath1  and @xmath2  luminosity - weighted temperature and density plots for the optically thin ( optimistic ) case in figure [ fig : phase ] . to make these phase diagrams ,",
    "we extract temperature and density profiles for 100@xmath102100 evenly - spaced lines of sight , apply our emissivities to each radial bin , and integrate the temperatures and densities with the @xmath1  and @xmath2  luminosities as weighting factors .",
    "thus each diagram represents the phases that we could actually probe by observing each line . in each phase diagram",
    ", the condensed phase of the igm is delineated by dot - dashed lines .",
    "the sharp edge of the condensed phase at @xmath70 arises from the lack of metal - line cooling in our simulations .",
    "the diamonds in figure [ fig : phase ] indicate the lines of sight that have @xmath2  or @xmath1  surface brightnesses larger than @xmath103 .",
    "most @xmath2  emission comes from a specific range of temperature ( @xmath104 ) and density ( @xmath105 ) that is remote from the condensed phase , whereas the brightest @xmath1  blobs have significant amounts of condensed phase gas . because self - shielding becomes important in the condensed phase , we exclude this phase in calculating the cooling maps ( in fig .",
    "[ fig : maps : z3 ] ) to produce our most conservative predictions .",
    "as we expected , this cutoff does not affect the cooling maps seriously , but does affect the @xmath1  cooling map dramatically , as gas particles with @xmath106 can not contribute to collisional excitation cooling but only to collisional excitation cooling .",
    "therefore , our predictions for the @xmath2  cooling radiation are far more robust than for @xmath1 .",
    "the next factor that could modify the ly@xmath4  cooling maps is the radiative transfer of ly@xmath4  photons , which could alter the shapes and surface brightness profiles of the blobs substantially .",
    "both the @xmath1  and @xmath3  photons produced in the optically thick medium will be transported to the outer region by resonant scattering until the optical depth becomes smaller than @xmath107 .",
    "ly@xmath4  photons escape eventually by scattering into the optically thin damping wing in the frequency domain , unless they are extinguished by dust .",
    "we expect that the igm at @xmath108 contains little dust and that the cooling emission from the igm is sufficiently far from the star - forming regions since we exclude the high density gas particles in our condensed phase cut case .",
    "therefore , the net effect of the resonant scattering in the spatial and frequency domains is to smooth the surface brightness out to the last scattering surfaces .",
    "for example , @xcite resorted to resonant scattering to explain the observed size of the steidel blobs .",
    "however , owing to the complicated structure of the density and to turbulent velocity fields , it is difficult to predict how much radiative transfer blurs the surface brightness of the cooling blob .",
    "the large bulk motions will especially affect the transfer of ly@xmath4  photons .",
    "depending on the optical depth and velocity field , photons can often undergo very little spatial diffusion and just random walk in velocity space until they reach a frequency where the optical depth is @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "a monte carlo ly@xmath4  radiative transfer calculation would be an ideal tool to make more realistic spatial and frequency maps of ly@xmath4  cooling radiation @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : los ] , we show the profiles of density , temperature , velocity , and and emissivity for a line of sight toward a typical ly@xmath4  blob to illustrate the complicated structure of these quantities . because we do _",
    "not _ take into account these radiative transfer effects in our cooling maps , the @xmath1  cooling map ( the upper middle panel in figure [ fig : maps : z3 ] ) should be smoothed to better represent reality . in contrast , because most resides in the ground state , making the igm optically thin to the @xmath2  line , our cooling maps should be accurate .    besides gravitational cooling and photoionization caused by the uv background ,",
    "supernova feedback is another energy source included in our simulations .",
    "when stars form in the simulations , supernova feedback energy is deposited into the surrounding gas in the form of heat . thermal energy deposited into dense , rapidly cooling gas",
    "is quickly radiated away , so feedback contributes somewhat to the cooling emission .",
    "however , we find that our density - temperature cutoff for the condensed phase effectively removes all the star - forming gas particles at each time step . because the supernova thermal input is directly proportional to the star formation rate , our cooling maps without the condensed phase should not be seriously contaminated by supernova feedback energy .",
    "thus the cooling maps in figure [ fig : maps : z3 ] with the condensed phase removed are still robust lower limits of the flux from the gravitational cooling .",
    "@xcite also show that while the re - radiated supernova energy dominates at lower luminosity , gravitational cooling becomes the dominant source as the mass and luminosity increase .      to study the properties of individual @xmath1  and @xmath2  sources like the ones shown in the cooling maps , we identify discrete groups of gas particles associated with individual dark matter halos and then calculate the total ly@xmath4and @xmath2  luminosities for these sources .",
    "to find the dark matter halos , we apply a friends - of - friends algorithm with a linking length that is 0.25 times the mean inter - particle separation .",
    "we count a gas particle as a member of the source , i.e. blob , associated with the dark matter halo if the distance from the potential center is less than the virial radius of the halo .",
    "we then add the ly@xmath4  and @xmath2  luminosities of the particles to obtain the total cooling luminosities of the blob .",
    "we restrict our analysis to blobs with more than 64 gas particles and 64 dark matter particles to mitigate numerical resolution effects .",
    "thus the smallest halo in the 22 mpc simulation has a gas mass of @xmath110 and dark matter mass of @xmath111 .",
    "these masses decrease to @xmath112 and @xmath113 in the 11 mpc simulation .",
    "@xmath1  and @xmath2  cooling luminosities show tight correlations with halo mass and star formation rate ( fig .",
    "[ fig : correlation ] ) .",
    "the open squares , crosses and circles represent the luminosities for the three different emissivities discussed in  [ sec : self ] : the optically thin case , the self - shielding correction case , and the condensed phase cut cases , respectively .",
    "the correlations are as one would expect : the more massive a galaxy is , the more gas accretes onto the galaxy , resulting in more cooling radiation and a higher star formation rate .",
    "the distribution of cooling luminosity is continuous , and we do not find any evidence that extended ly@xmath4  or emission originates only from high - mass systems or high density regions .",
    "the solid line in the upper panel in figure [ fig : correlation ] indicates the ly@xmath4  emission due to recombination from stellar ionizing photons .",
    "we assume a conversion factor of @xmath114 for a @xmath115 star formation rate with no dust absorption , no escaping ionizing photons , a salpeter imf , and solar metallicity . under these assumptions the ly@xmath4  emission from star formation in galaxies always dominates the ly@xmath4  emission from the surrounding igm , even in the ( most optimistic ) optically thin case .",
    "this result is consistent with the predictions of @xcite and @xcite",
    ".  from cooling radiation dominates the ly@xmath4  from star formation in more massive systems .",
    "we suspect that this difference is a consequence of including a photoionizing background in the simulation analyzed here . ]",
    "the strong correlation between the ly@xmath4  cooling rate in the optically thin case ( squares ) and the star formation rate results from the fact that the gas in the condensed phase tends to satisfy the star formation criteria of the simulation and is likely to form stars in the next time step .",
    "in contrast , the emission caused by star formation is quite uncertain because only extremely low metallicity ( @xmath116 ) stars can emit the hard ionizing photons necessary to ionize .",
    "however , star formation at @xmath5 is unlikely to be dominated by population iii or extremely low metallicity stars .",
    "unlike for ly@xmath4 , the contribution of star formation to must be negligible .",
    "we discuss this point in more detail in ",
    "[ sec : dis ] .",
    "figure [ fig : lf ] shows the ly@xmath4  and luminosity functions ( lfs ) for the three emissivity cases at @xmath87 and 3 .",
    "the lfs include emission only from the igm .",
    "the solid , dashed , and dot - dashed lines represent the optically thin , the self - shielding correction , and the condensed phase cut cases , respectively .",
    "the horizontal dotted lines indicate the number density of one halo in the simulation volume .",
    "note that the distributions extend to brighter blobs as we increase the simulation volume because the larger simulations contain higher mass systems .",
    "note also that the ly@xmath4  luminosity function is very sensitive to the assumed emissivities , whereas the @xmath2  cooling luminosity depends much less on the treatment of the self - shielded or condensed phase of the igm .",
    "this large variation of the ly@xmath4  luminosity is consistent with the results of @xcite .      to estimate the detectability of cooling emission from the extended sources , we convert the rest - frame cooling maps at @xmath87 and @xmath97 into observed surface brightness maps and rebin them with a pixel scale of @xmath117 to mimic the independent resolution elements of ground - based observations ( fig . [ fig : maps : z3 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : histogram ] shows the surface brightness distributions of the rebinned cooling maps at @xmath87 and @xmath97 , assuming the conservative condensed phase cut case .",
    "note that the distributions depend strongly on the size of the bins in the surface brightness maps , because the bright , small - scale structures are smoothed out by binning .",
    "we express each surface brightness distribution in terms of the number of binned pixels per comoving volume and also the number of pixels per square arcmin if one were to observe through a @xmath118 narrow band filter .",
    "the projected angular extents of the 11 mpc simulation at @xmath87 and @xmath97 are @xmath119 and @xmath120 , respectively .",
    "the depth of the 11 mpc simulation is @xmath95 and @xmath96 for @xmath87 and @xmath97 , respectively .",
    "deep , wide - field ( @xmath121 ) , narrow - band ( @xmath6 ) imaging is an effective way to detect cooling radiation , because sky noise dominates in this low surface brightness range .",
    "for example , the average sky background at 6500  on the ground is @xmath122 @xmath123 , comparable to our estimates for the brightest blobs . in figure",

    "@xmath1  and @xmath2  ( balmer @xmath4 ) cooling emission at @xmath5 are potentially detectable with deep narrow band imaging and/or spectroscopy from the ground . @xmath3  will be unreachable until a large aperture uv space telescope ( e.g. suvo ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is available .    \\2 . while our predictions for the strength of the @xmath1  emission line depend strongly on how to handle the self - shielded gas , our predictions for the @xmath2  line are rather robust owing to the negligible emissivity of for the self - shielded igm below @xmath235 .",
    "although @xmath2  cooling emission is fainter than ly@xmath4   by at least a factor of 10 and , unlike ly@xmath4  blobs , might not be resolved spatially with current observational facilities , it is more suitable to study gas accretion in the galaxy formation process because it is optically thin , less sensitive to the uv background , and less contaminated by recombination lines from star - forming galaxies .",
    "\\4 . to use the @xmath1  and @xmath2  cooling lines to constrain galaxy formation models , we first need to exclude the other possible mechanisms for producing ly@xmath4  blobs .",
    "first , because @xmath2  emission from stars is limited to stars with very low metallicities ( @xmath8 ) and population iii objects , its detection , unlike ly@xmath4 , can not be caused by stellar populations .",
    "second , the kinematics of the @xmath2  line can distinguish gravitational cooling radiation from a scenario in which starburst - driven superwinds power ly@xmath4  blobs , because the line width from cooling gas is narrower ( @xmath236 ) than the typical wind speeds ( which are factors of several higher ) .",
    "third , if some fraction of the emitting blobs are powered by agn , additional diagnostics such as the line and/or x - ray emission can be used to discriminate gravitationally cooling blobs from those powered , at least in part , by agn .",
