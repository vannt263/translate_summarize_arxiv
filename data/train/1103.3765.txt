    "it follows that the fourth generation neutrino must have a dirac or a majorana mass term .",

    "it requires a somewhat accurate adjustment of masses and couplings to ensure that one obtains the correct relic density and an acceptable velocity distribution for @xmath60 .",
    "assuming that such a mechanism is at work , the elastic @xmath60-nucleon cross section is again evaluated using micromegas .",
    "both the spin independent ( si ) and spin dependent ( ds ) scattering cross sections with nucleons turn out to be constrained by experiments .    the currently most stringent constraint on si nucleon scattering comes from the cdms @xcite and xenon 100 @xcite experiments , and have reached a sensitivity of @xmath204  pb .",
    "the si cross section is dominated by higgs boson exchange and thus depends on @xmath97 and on the light quark form factors of the nucleon . in the mssm",
    "the strange quark form factor @xmath205 is a major source of uncertainty , since the couplings to down type quarks are enhanced by @xmath206 , see e.g. @xcite for recent discussions of this issue .    for the case considered here ,",
    "the strange quark form factor is not as dominant , but still affects the exclusion limit , as will be shown later .",
    "the parameter dependence of the higgs mediated scattering cross section is easy to understand .",
    "the @xmath60 couplings to the higgs boson are proportional to @xmath38 and also enhanced for large @xmath77 , while the exchange of the higgs boson in the t - channel gives rise to a @xmath207 behavior . for small @xmath97",
    "this leads to exclusion of @xmath38 values above @xmath208  gev . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dd ] the excluded region in the @xmath200 plane is shown for the case of a @xmath209  gev higgs boson .",

    "dark matter in the @xmath38-@xmath77 plane , for @xmath197  gev and @xmath198  gev , under the assumption that @xmath210 .",
    "the red shaded areas are excluded by constraints on the spin dependent nucleon cross section , for the indicated values of @xmath205 .",
    "the whole parameter space is also excluded by constraints on the spin dependent neutrino - neutron cross section , as indicated by the blue stripes . ]",
    "constraints on spin - dependent neutrino - nucleon scattering are much weaker when compared naively to the si constraints , the best limit coming from the xenon 10 experiment @xcite .",
    "it constraints the sd neutron cross section to be smaller than @xmath86  pb .",
    "this limit turns out to be very restrictive for majorana neutrino dark matter , due to its large coupling to the @xmath5-boson .",
    "a purely majorana neutrino is excluded in the mass range of @xmath211  gev@xmath212  tev .    in the mixed dirac - majorana case considered here ,",
    "the coupling to the @xmath5-boson is reduced by @xmath213 , thus the cross section is reduced by @xmath214 . in the case of",
    "maximal mixing , the constraint becomes somewhat weaker , but still excludes majorana neutrino dark matter for masses roughly between @xmath215  gev and @xmath216  gev , and thus the whole parameter range in fig .",
    "[ fig : dd ] .    in conclusion ,",
    "forth generation neutrino dark matter is heavily constrained by dark matter direct detection experiments , even in the mixed dirac - majorana scenario , under the assumption that the neutrino relic density matches the observed dark matter abundance .",
    "these constraints are relaxed if either the local dark matter density and velocity distribution is different from the one assumed to obtain the limits , or if the majorana neutrinos are only one of several dark matter species . in particular case where @xmath60 is a thermal relic",
    "is not constrained by spin dependent neutron scattering , since the density is at least a factor of 5 smaller .",
    "this regime will however be probed by the next generation of experiments  @xcite .",
    "finally @xmath60 annihilation in the sun and in the galactic halo is suppressed by the small thermal relic abundance , and therefore does not impose further constraints on the scenarios considered here  @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed the effects of stable fourth generation majorana neutrinos on higgs phenomenology and on cosmology .",
    "the rate @xmath217 is an important test of the standard model of physics , and will eventually be measured at the lhc , provided that the higgs boson is there .",
    "a deviation of the sm prediction is a clear indication that new physics is changing either the higgs production cross section or its branching fractions , or both .",
    "we have shown that in the presence of stable majorana neutrinos , this rate @xmath218 can be reduced significantly , despite the strong enhancement of the higgs production cross section due to the fourth generation quarks .",
    "the semi - invisible decays of the higgs boson into @xmath90 and @xmath49 pairs provide unique signals at the lhc , and might play an important role in understanding deviations in @xmath218 .",
    "when the mass splittings between the neutrino states are small , these signals are very challenging , since the produced leptons are rather soft .    a stable @xmath60 is not excluded by current dark matter direct detection experiments , provided that @xmath219 is large enough to prevent large inelastic scattering rates . in this case @xmath60 will have a nonzero thermal relic density that can reach up to 20% of the observed dar matter density , but is below 10% for most of the parameter space .",
    "the possibility that all dark matter is of @xmath60 type , e.g. invoking a non - thermal production mechanism , is excluded by constraints on the spin dependent dark matter - neutron cross section .",
    "future direct detection experiments will strengthen these bounds and constrain the fraction of dark matter that can be of @xmath60 type to be less than 10% .",
    "a stable fourth generation has an abundance of interesting phenomenological consequences .",
    "besides the effects on higgs phenomenology presented here , there can be signals of stable charged particles @xcite , quark - antiquark bound states @xcite and lepton flavor violation @xcite at the lhc . in the context of the present discussion",
