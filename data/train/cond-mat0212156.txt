    "the study of the plasticity of crystalline materials is a rich many - body problem involving physics on multiple length scales , with many remaining unexplained mysteries .",
    "the plasticity of bcc metals , for instance , is particularly challenging . unlike their fcc and hcp counterparts , the bcc metals exhibit many active slip planes , have a strong temperature dependence in their plasticity and violate the simple empirical schmid law  @xcite .",
    "moreover , theoretical calculations of the most basic question in plasticity , the stress needed to induce yield at low temperature in a pure sample , differ from experimental extrapolations by over a factor of two  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to provide needed insight into this discrepancy .",
    "ultimately , it is the physics of the @xmath0 screw dislocation defect which controls the low - temperature plasticity of bcc materials  @xcite . the peierls stress , the yield stress at which these dislocations first begin to move spontaneously , is difficult to compare directly with experiment . whereas most computational work on the peierls stress measures the stress to move an isolated , infinitely straight dislocation at zero temperature  @xcite , experiments measure the peierls stress at a finite temperature in systems with many interacting , curved dislocations and in media with defects and surfaces . as an example of the present challenges which the literature faces , using model generalized pseudopotential theory ( mgpt )  @xcite , yang _ et .",
    "al._@xcite predict for the t=0 peierls stress a value 2.5 times greater than experimental extrapolations  @xcite . because such potentials are not based upon first principles ,",
    "it is impossible to determine _ a priori _ whether this discrepancy is due to the inter - atomic potential , the environmental complexities discussed above , or to a flaw in our understanding of the relation between the peierls stress and the experiments .    as it is a daunting experimental task  @xcite to observe properties of a single dislocation locked deep in the heart of a material , accurate theoretical calculations of such systems is essential .",
    "nearly all theoretical calculations to date , concerning such dislocations , have relied upon empirical potentials  @xcite .",
    "given the empirical nature of such calculations , the complex directional bonding properties of bcc materials , and the lack of direct comparison with experiments for validation , first principles _ ab initio _ calculations of dislocations in such systems are clearly needed .",
    "ismail - beigi and arias@xcite were the first to show that density functional theory calculations were crucial in understanding the fundamental properties of the @xmath1 screw dislocation core structure in bcc molybdenum and tantalum . until that work ,",
    "most computational studies based on empirical potentials  @xcite , supported the idea that the dislocation core breaks symmetry , with two energetically equivalent ground state structures which spread outward along two different equivalent sets of three @xmath2 planes@xcite , similar to the concept originally proposed by hirsch  @xcite .",
    "until the availability of the _ ab initio _ calculations , the prevailing view of the violation of the schmid law in the bcc metals was based upon this structure  @xcite .",
    "ismail - beigi and arias  @xcite , in contrast , showed that for both molybdenum and tantalum the ground - state structure within density functional theory was a non - degenerate symmetric core , strongly supporting the work of suzuki and takeuchi  @xcite which first suggested that it is the peierls potential itself that controls the lattice resistance and not the details of the core structure . to help resolve the discrepancy between theoretical and experimental peierls stresses , the work below provides a reliable _ ab initio _ prediction of the peierls stress in bcc tantalum which is free of the unrealistic electronic boundary conditions employed in the only other _ ab initio _ prediction of the peierls stress@xcite .    here ,",
    "we show that the peierls stress , calculated within density function theory , is over a factor of _ five _ larger than expected from extrapolation of experimental results  @xcite .",
    "this supports the view that the discrepancy between the experimental and computational predictions are largely due to the aforementioned environmental complexities , to a flaw in relating the experimental data to the peierls stress , or to a combination of both .    to further explore possible physical effects leading to this discrepancy",
    ", we study the extrapolation of experimental data to determine the zero - temperature peierls stress . such extrapolations generally employ fits from mesoscopic or thermodynamics / kinetic models  @xcite .",
    "however , it has not been established that such models can accurately describe the lowest temperature regime correctly , placing doubt on the quality of these extrapolations . to address this issue",
    ", the work below also provides the first temperature- and orientation- dependent study of the peierls stress in a bcc metal .",
    "we moreover show that extrapolation of our finite temperature results using a current fitting model leads to an underestimation of the zero - temperature peierls stress .",
    "this underscores the difficulty in extrapolating the experimental data accurately but does not fully account for the observed discrepancy .    in section  [ sec - bc",
    "] , this manuscript reviews the various techniques in use for calculation of the peierls stress in the context of efficacy for application to _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "section  [ sec - tempdep ] gives the first calculation of the temperature and orientation dependent peierls stress in a bcc material .",
    "section  [ sec - conv ] describes our technique for obtaining peierls stresses within small unit cells with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "finally , section  [ sec - results ] presents our _ ab initio _",
    "prediction for the peierls stress and compares and contrasts it to currently available experimental and computational values .",
    "the fundamental distinction among theoretical approaches to calculation of the peierls stress is the choice of boundary condition .",
    "the literature describes three types of boundary conditions : cylindrical boundary conditions  @xcite , greens function ( or `` flexible '' ) boundary conditions  @xcite , and periodic boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "we now briefly review each with emphasis on the unique challenges of _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations .      in the practice of cylindrical boundary conditions , anisotropic elasticity theory  @xcite",
    "is used to generate a dislocation in the center of a cylinder .",
    "the cylinder is then separated into _ inner _ and _ outer _ regions .",
    "the atoms in the outer region are held fixed to the solution of anisotropic elasticity theory while the atoms in the inner region relax under the inter - atomic forces . to calculate the peierls stress ,",
    "a stress is applied to the system until the dislocation moves .",
    "this approach suffers numerous draw backs when applied to density functional theory . to avoid surface effects and to properly account for the non - linear nature of the dislocation",
    ", such cylinders generally have to be quite large .",
    "first , even the outer cylinder is of finite size and therefore the outer region must be sufficiently large enough so that forces generated by it onto the inner region are equivalent to those generated from an infinite continuum",
    ". the inner region also must be sufficiently large to mitigate two effects .",
    "the inner region must be large enough so that linear elasticity theory represents well the forces which it imposes on the outer region .",
    "the inner region also must be large enough so that motion of the dislocation is not adversely affected by the fixed outer region , which is a concern because the fixed outer region represents the displacement field when a dislocation is at its center and therefore generates a extraneous force which tends to prevent motion of the dislocation  @xcite .",
    "when using simple , inter - atomic potentials , the use of large cylinders mitigates all of these effects .",
    "however , this approach is not viable for density functional calculations with their extreme computational demands .",
    "this approach , moreover , is particularly ill - suited for electronic structure calculations because the artificial surface at the outside of the outer region , being far different from the bulk , give rise to strong scattering of the electrons far different than would an infinite continuum .",
    "this is particularly problematic for metals , because the single - particle density matrix , which quantifies the effects of this scattering on the inter - atomic forces , decays only algebraically in metals  @xcite .",
    "the following subsection demonstrates that the boundary regions should be quite large in order for these surface effects not to result in large fictitious forces in the active region of the calculation .",
    "the use of greens function , or flexible , boundary conditions  @xcite , is an effective way to reduce the size of the simulation cell .",
    "this approach also employs a cylindrical geometry .",
    "however , rather than the `` inner '' and `` outer '' atomistic regions of the cylindrical boundary approach , the greens function approach employs three inter - atomic regions : an inner `` core '' region containing the center of the dislocation , an intermediate `` buffer '' region , and an outermost `` continuum - response '' region . with _ proper _ implementation , the outer and inner regions couple only indirectly through the response of the buffer region .    in this method ,",
    "all three regions respond to the presence of a dislocation ; however the response of each region is treated differently through a number of steps .",
    "initially , all regions are displaced by the solution to anisotropic elasticity theory .",
    "each iteration then begins by relaxing the atoms in the core region according to the forces which they experience , as computed from either an inter - atomic potential or an _ ab initio _ method .",
    "the forces generated from the mismatch between the outer and inner regions , which the cylindrical approach above ignores , are then relieved by moving the atoms of _ all three regions _ according to the elastic greens function solution , leaving only the nonlinear effects from the core region unaccounted .",
    "the next iteration then begins by relaxing these forces as described above .",
    "iterations proceed until until the forces in the core and buffer region are negligible .",
    "what distinguishes this approach from simple cylindrical boundary conditions is that the continuum region , via the greens function response , is allowed to respond to the motion of the dislocation and to the elastic response generated by the core region as the dislocation moves .",
    "so long as the continuum response region ( a ) accurately represents the structure induced by the presence of the dislocation and ( b ) is sufficiently wide to properly reproduce the forces on the atoms in the buffer and inner regions , this approach accurately describe basic properties of a dislocation .    in order for the first assumption ( a ) above to hold",
    ", the inner core region must be sufficiently large to contain all atoms with displacements outside of the linear regime and the buffer region must be sufficiently wide so that displaced atoms in the core have no effect on the forces experienced in the continuum - response region .",
    "the second assumption ( b ) requires that the continuum - response region to be sufficiently large so that its termination has no effect on the forces on the atoms in the buffer or inner region .",
    "the radius of the calculation must therefore exceed the sum of the non - linear core radius plus twice the range over which motion of atoms creates forces within the lattice . as the latter range can be quite large for electronic structure calculations in metals , the application of this approach to electronic structure calculations can be problematic .    the greens function approach has predicted successfully dislocation properties when applied to time consuming empirical potentials  @xcite which have a limited interaction range .",
    "the approach also has been applied to density functional calculations of the peierls stress for molybdenum and tantalum@xcite , where its application is more questionable due to the above interactions . in these latter works , the artificial boundary on the outside of the continuum - response region have been treated in one of two ways  @xcite , either by keeping the surface free in vacuum or by embedding in periodic boundary conditions with the vacuum filled with material which must contain severe domain boundaries due to the incompatibility of a net burgers vector with periodic boundary conditions .    to gauge the effects which this artificial boundary may have and how far these effects penetrate from the continuum - response region into the buffer region , we perform a test calculation within the density functional theory pseudopotential approach  @xcite of the magnitude of the forces generated onto the system due to the presence of a domain boundary similar to those in the works cited above  @xcite .    for this calculation",
    ", we employ the same computational procedure as for our production calculations in section  [ sec - results ] . here , however , as this is a test , we employ only a single @xmath3-point to sample the brillouin zone ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "we begin with an orthorhombic cell of 24 atoms of tantalum in a bulk arrangement with supercell lattice vectors @xmath5 $ ] , @xmath6 $ ] and @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "we choose this cell because its length along @xmath8 is the same as the smallest simulation cell used in references  and  .",
    "we then generate a domain boundary at the edge of cell along the @xmath9 plane by changing the lattice vector @xmath8 to @xmath10 + \\alpha \\vec r_3 $ ] and holding the atoms in the unit cell fixed in their bulk locations .",
    "@xmath11 is chosen such that the shift is small and the nearest neighbor distance is always within @xmath12 of the bulk , representing even less of a disturbance that in reference  , where atom were within @xmath13 of the bulk nearest neighbor distance . to estimate the effect of the scattering of electrons at the domain boundary on the inter - atomic forces , we hold the atoms fixed and compute the _ ab initio _ forces acting upon them .",
    "figure  [ fig : domain ] shows the forces along the @xmath14 $ ] direction as a function of distance from the center of each domain .",
    "note that relatively large forces develop deep within the cell .",
    "this data indicates that the continuum - response region should be quite large ( @xmath15   ) in order for the response of the electrons not to adversely effect the forces in the buffer region .",
    "note also that the the buffer region should be of similar width to prevent forces from the non - linear displacements in the core from penetrating into the linear continuum - response region .",
    "such large continuum - response and buffer regions can make the calculation infeasible with current computational techniques .",
    "in fact , the only density functional calculations of the peierls stress in this system to date employ the greens function method but with a distance from the buffer region to the domain boundary of only @xmath16   .",
    "it thus is unclear whether the continuum region in these calculations is sufficiently large to lead to reliable results and clearly further calculations are needed to support those results .",
    "below , we provide just such calculations using the method of periodic boundary conditions , which perturb the electronic system far less than the introduction of domain boundaries .",
    "+   +      the final common choice for boundary conditions is to repeat the dislocation core periodically throughout space , so that the dislocation is no longer isolated , but embedded in bulk material containing an array of dislocations .",
    "consistency with periodic boundary conditions then demands that the unit cell contain an even number of dislocations with burgers vectors of alternating sign , arranged typically in dipolar  @xcite or quadrupolar  @xcite arrays . for static properties of the dislocation core , such cells give reliable results as the elastic fields of the surrounding dislocations effectively cancel at the location of each core .",
    "periodic boundary conditions can also been used to calculate the peierls stress  @xcite .",
    "care must be taken , however , because the symmetry of the dipole / quadrupole array breaks as the dislocations move and the dislocation - dislocation interaction then ceases to be negligible .",
    "the use of large unit cells can control this effect@xcite ; however , such a direct , brute - force approach is not practical for computationally demanding _ ab initio _ calculations . to make such calculations feasible",
    ", they must occur in small periodic cells , thereby demanding proper accounting of the dislocation - dislocation interactions .",
    "we have shown in another work  @xcite that , under certain conditions , such interactions can be accounted accurately with minimal extra computational effort , so that accurate values of the peierls stress can be obtained from density functional calculations in periodic cells .",
    "as the residual errors with this approach are associated with the boundary conditions , the magnitude of such an error can be tested by other computational methods , such as empirical potentials .",
    "our previous work shows that that this residual error is relatively small  @xcite , a fact which we confirm explicitly below .    because the deviations from the bulk arrangement at periodic boundaries are relatively mild , such calculations are ideal for mitigating electronic boundary effects .",
    "given the simplicity of working with these boundary conditions and the possibility of the extraction of accurate values for the peierls stress from small unit cells , we choose to work with periodic boundary conditions throughout this work .",
    "section  [ sec - conv ] outlines our procedure for calculating the peierls stress while working with periodic boundary conditions and describes the sources and the magnitude of the residual errors .",
    "( see reference   for a full discussion of these issues . )",
    "to illustrate the complexities of relating computational predictions to experimental findings , we now explore the dependence of the peierls stress in bcc tantalum on orientation and temperature .",
    "the strong dependencies which we shall find underscore the unique properties of dislocations in bcc metals . to clarify , as some authors use slightly different definitions for the peierls stress , here we consider the peierls stress as the value of the stress on the maximum resolved shear stress plane ( maximum value of the shear stress along the [ 111]-direction ) when the dislocation _",
    "first _ moves to a different equilibrium position .    despite recent advances in _ ab initio _ quantum mechanical methods , such methods are still too computationally intensive to study such properties as the temperature dependence of the peierls stress .",
    "therefore , for these calculations , we employ a molecular dynamics ( md ) framework carried out using a first - principles - based , many body force field ( ff ) for tantalum , which we denote qeam , which we have developed to allow accurate and computationally efficient evaluation of atomic interactions  @xcite .",
    "as described above , we carry out these calculations within periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the super - cell consists of a quadrupolar arrangement  @xcite of dislocations containing 5670 atoms with lattice parameters @xmath17   , @xmath18    and @xmath19   , where the @xmath20- , @xmath21- , and @xmath22- axes of our coordinate system are along @xmath23 $ ] , @xmath24 $ ] , and @xmath14 $ ] directions , respectively . as we have shown in another work  @xcite",
    ", such a cell gives very accurate values for the peierls stress .",
    "to calculate the zero temperature peierls stress , we start with a fully relaxed quadrupole dislocation configuration at zero stress and increase the stress in steps of 50 mpa until the dislocations move .",
    "once the dislocations move , we restart the calculation from the structure equilibrated just prior to the motion and increase the stress in smaller steps ( 5 mpa ) in order to more narrowly define the critical stress . at each incremental target stress , we relax the atoms and stresses in the cell by running two very low temperature ( t=0.001 k ) md simulations .",
    "the first run is for 15 ps at constant stress and temperature ( n@xmath26 t ensemble ) using a rahman - parrinello barostat  @xcite and a hoover  @xcite thermostat , and the second run is for 50 ps at constant volume and temperature ( nvt ensemble ) .",
    "we find this approach to be quite stable for relaxing the cell and the atoms of the system .",
    "the @xmath25 screw dislocation has three equivalent \\{112 } and three equivalent \\{110 } potential slip planes , with such planes occurring at 30@xmath27 intervals . to study the orientation dependence of the peierls stress , we apply three types of pure shear stress to the system : a @xmath28 stress , a positive @xmath29 stress and a negative @xmath29 stress .",
    "( note that with coordinate axes as defined above , the @xmath22-axis lies along the dislocation line . )",
    "these stresses leads to forces on the dislocation in the @xmath30 , @xmath31-twinning and @xmath31-antitwinning directions , respectively@xcite . along these directions ,",
    "we find peierls stresses of @xmath32  =  655  mpa , @xmath33  =  575  mpa , and @xmath34  =  1075  mpa , respectively .",
    "table  [ table_peierls_orint ] shows that our essentially zero - temperature results are in good agreement with those of yang and collaborators  @xcite , who employed model generalized pseudopotential theory ( mgpt)@xcite , a different inter - atomic potential .",

    "the lattice vectors of this cell are @xmath40 . to carry out the integrations over the brillouin zone we use a non - zero electronic temperature of @xmath41  ev to facilitate integration over the fermi surface and sample the zone at sixteen special @xmath3-points  @xcite .",

    "most noticeably , the atomistic landscapes are three times stiffer than the _ ab initio _ landscapes .",
    "this raises the question whether the approximate factor of three overestimate of theoretical calculations over the extrapolation of the experimental peierls stresses to zero - temperature is due to defects in the inter - atomic potentials or to failures in the connection between the experiments and the theoretical calculations .      to compute the peierls stress ,",

    "we therefore do not expect the long - range nature of electronic effects in metallic systems to greatly affect the value which shall extract for the peierls stress .",
    "we also note that the empirical potential results for tantalum ( section  [ sec - conv ] ) had a very large cutoff of 9  and accurate results were obtained in the smallest cells used in those calculations .",

    "these results are slightly lower than the previous density functional results of @xmath47 1.8  gpa obtained using greens function boundary conditions@xcite .",
