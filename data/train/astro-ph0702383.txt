    "ever since their identification by @xcite , alfvn waves have been extensively studied using _ in situ _",
    "measurements , such as by helios and ulysses , covering the heliocentric distance from 0.29 to 4.3  au @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the non - thermal broadening of a number of ultraviolet lines , such as those measured with the sumer ( solar ultraviolet measurements of emitted radiation ) and uvcs ( ultraviolet coronagraph spectrometer ) instruments on soho ( the solar and heliospheric observatory ) , is usually attributed to the transverse velocity fluctuations , thereby enabling one to infer the amplitudes of these fluctuations in the inner corona below @xmath11  @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the faraday rotation measurements , which yield information regarding the line - of - sight magnetic field fluctuations , have been shown to support indirectly the presence of alfvn waves inside 10  @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the solar wind in intermediate regions , for the time being , can be explored only by radio scintillation measurements which allow one to derive the velocity fluctuations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is noteworthy that although the hourly - scale fluctuations seem to be more frequently studied , the fluctuation spectrum measured by helios nevertheless spans a broad frequency range from @xmath3 to @xmath12  @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical investigations into the interaction between alfvn waves and the solar wind have been performed in the short wavelength wkb limit which makes the problem more tractable mathematically .",
    "for instance , by employing the wkb approximation , @xcite derived an expression for the ponderomotive force through which the alfvn waves may provide further acceleration to the solar wind .",
    "the wave acceleration was later incorporated in detailed numerical models by , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "it was soon realized that alfvn waves may also heat the solar wind via dissipative processes such as the cyclotron resonance interaction between ions and high frequency , parallel propagating waves generated by a turbulent cascade ( cf . the extensive review by @xcite ) .",
    "such a parallel cascade scenario has been successful in explaining a number of observations , to name but one , the significant thermal anisotropy of ions as established by uvcs measurements @xcite . as pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "the applicability of the wkb approximation in which the processes are formulated is questionable in the near - sun region in view of the large alfvn speeds .",
    "furthermore , a turbulent cascade requires a non - vanishing magnetic reynolds stress tensor , which , however , is zero in the wkb limit since the particle and field components of the tensor cancel each other exactly .",
    "a non - wkb analysis is therefore required to account for the wave reflection and the consequent driving of any turbulence cascade .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "non - wkb analysis of alfvn waves in the solar wind has been carried out for decades ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this , however , is almost exclusively done in the framework of ideal mhd , which allows waves propagating in opposite directions to be explicitly separated when the elssser  variables are used .",
    "the adoption of the elssser  variables has also enabled a new turbulence phenomenology concerning the nonlinear coupling between counter - propagating waves @xcite . this coupling term , if interpreted as the energy cascaded towards fluctuations with increasingly large perpendicular wavenumbers , is also more consistent with theoretical expectations .",
    "despite substantial advances achieved in ideal mhd , which is appropriate for the description of the gross properties of the solar wind , the non - wkb analysis of alfvn waves has rarely been done using multi - fluid transport equations .",
    "in contrast , multi - fluid , alfvn wave driven solar wind modeling formulated in the wkb limit has reached considerable sophistication ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "such a multi - fluid approach is particularly necessary for the solar wind since the alpha particles must be included given their non - negligible abundance and the fact that the proton - alpha differential speed can be a substantial fraction of the proton speed in the fast stream @xcite .",
    "there is therefore an obvious need to extend available non - wkb analyses of alfvn waves from the ideal mhd to the multi - fluid case .",
    "the intent of this paper is to present an analysis of alfvn waves in a 3-fluid solar wind assuming axial symmetry , without assuming that the wavelength is small compared with the spatial scales at which the background parameters vary .",
    "the perturbed velocity and magnetic field are assumed to be in the azimuthal direction , i.e , only purely toroidal waves are investigated . to further simplify the treatment ,",
    "the wave dissipation is neglected .",
    "this simplification is necessary here since if one wants to gain some quantitative insights into the wave dissipation , and to maintain a reasonable self - consistency at the same time , one should formulate the dissipation in terms of the amplitudes of waves propagating outwards and inwards . to this end",
    ", a full multi - fluid elssser  analysis is required but is unfortunately unavailable at the present time . however , if the wave dissipation is neglected and therefore the nonlinear interaction between waves and the multicomponent wind is entirely through the agent of ponderomotive forces , then the problem can be formulated without distinguishing explicitly between the directions of wave propagation ( cf .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec_mathform ] ,",
    "we show how to reduce the general multi - fluid transport equations to the desired form .",
    "the resultant equations governing the fourier amplitudes of toroidal alfvn waves at a given frequency are then solved analytically in two limiting cases , namely the wkb and zero - frequency limits , in section  [ sec_ana_sol ] .",
    "apart from these analytically tractable cases , the equations have to be solved numerically . in section  [ sec_num_model ] , we re - formulate the model equations for numerical convenience , describe the background flow parameters and detail the solution procedure as well .",
    "the numerical solutions for three different frequencies are presented in section  [ sec_num_res ] .",
    "finally , section  [ sec_conc ] summarizes the results , ending with some concluding remarks .",
    "presented in this section is the mathematical development of the equations that govern the toroidal fluctuations in a solar wind which consists of electrons ( @xmath14 ) , protons ( @xmath15 ) and alpha particles ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "each species @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) is characterized by its mass @xmath19 , electric charge @xmath20 , number density @xmath21 , mass density @xmath22 , velocity @xmath23 , and partial pressure @xmath24 .",
    "if measured in units of the electron charge @xmath14 , @xmath20 may be expressed by @xmath25 with @xmath26 by definition .    to simplify the mathematical treatment , a number of assumptions",
    "have been made and are collected as follows :    1 .",
    "it is assumed that the solar wind can be described by the standard transport equations in the five - moment approximation .",
    "2 .   quasi neutrality and quasi - zero current are assumed , i.e. , @xmath27 and @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "symmetry about the magnetic axis is assumed , i.e. , @xmath30 in a heliocentric spherical coordinate system ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the time - independent solar wind interacts with the waves only through the wave - induced ponderomotive forces .",
    "the wave frequency considered is in the hydromagnetic regime , i.e. , well below the ion gyro - frequencies .",
    "the perturbed velocity and magnetic field are assumed to be in the @xmath32 direction only .",
    "the effects of the solar rotation on the background solar wind are neglected such that there is no need to consider the coupling of alfvn waves to the compressional modes in the presence of a spiral magnetic field .",
    "the effects of the coulomb friction on the waves are neglected , and so is the wave - induced modification of the coulomb friction between background ion flows .",
    "the equations appropriate for a multi - component solar wind plasma in the standard five - moment approximation are as follows ( for the derivation see appendix a.1 in @xcite ) @xmath33 \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\frac{z_k}{4\\pi n_e m_k}\\left(\\nabla\\times\\vec{b}\\right)\\times\\vec{b } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{z_k e}{m_k c } \\frac{n_j z_j}{n_e } \\left(\\vec{v}_j-\\vec{v}_k\\right)\\times\\vec{b }         = 0 ,    \\label{gen_vec_vk }   \\\\",

    "moreover , @xmath43 is the heat flux carried by species @xmath17 , and @xmath44 stands for the heating rate applied to species @xmath17 from non - thermal processes . in equation  ( [ gen_vec_vk ] ) , the subscript @xmath45 stands for ion species other than @xmath35 , namely , @xmath46 for @xmath47 and vice versa . as can be seen , in addition to the term @xmath48 , the lorentz force possesses a new term in the form of the cross product of the ion velocity difference and magnetic field .",
    "physically , this new term represents the mutual gyration of one ion species about the other , the axis of gyration being in the direction of the instantaneous magnetic field .",
    "equations  ( [ gen_nk ] ) to ( [ gen_vec_magind ] ) form a complete set if supplemented with the description of species heat fluxes @xmath43 and heating rates @xmath44 . as such",
    ", they can be invoked to depict self - consistently the interaction between alfvn waves and the solar wind species by explicitly introducing these waves via boundary conditions . on the one hand",
    "solving this set of equations presents a computationally formidable task ; on the other hand , one can extract the necessary information concerning the dynamical feedback of the waves to the plasma by going beyond the wkb limit . in the non - wkb approach to be adopted here",
    ", one assumes that the governing equations can still be separated into those governing the background time - independent flow and those governing the transport of waves . as noted by @xcite ( also see the discussion ) , this separation does not necessarily require the waves be linear as long as sufficiently small wave amplitudes are imposed at the sun .",
    "further simplification also results from the choice of a flux tube coordinate system , in which the base vectors are @xmath49 , where @xmath50 with the subscript @xmath51 denoting the poloidal component .",
    "moreover , the independent variable @xmath52 is the arclength along the poloidal magnetic field line .",
    "this choice permits the decomposition of the magnetic field and species velocities into background ones and fluctuations , @xmath53 where @xmath54 . from the assumption of azimuthal symmetry , and the assumption that @xmath55 is time - independent",
    ", one can see from the poloidal component of equation  ( [ gen_vec_magind ] ) that @xmath56 should be strictly in the direction of @xmath55 .",
    "in other words , @xmath57 to a good approximation . now let us consider the @xmath32 component of the momentum equation  ( [ gen_vec_vk ] ) .",
    "since the wave frequencies in question as well as other frequencies associated with the spatial dependence are well below the ion gyro - frequency @xmath58 ( @xmath29 ) , from an order - of - magnitude estimate one can see that @xmath59 .",
    "combined with the fact that @xmath57 , this leads to that both @xmath60 and @xmath61 should be very small and can be safely neglected unless they appear alongside the ion gyro - frequency . with this in mind",
    ", one can find from the @xmath62 component of equation  ( [ gen_vec_vk ] ) that @xmath63 that is , the ion velocity difference is aligned with the instantaneous magnetic field .",
    "this alignment condition further couples one ion species to the other .",
    "note that due to the assumption of quasi - zero current , equation  ( [ ion_vdiff ] ) leads to @xmath64 where @xmath29 .",
    "given the aforementioned assumptions , the time - independent multicomponent solar wind in which the toroidal alfvn waves propagate is governed by @xmath65 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the arclength @xmath52 which becomes the only independent spatial variable .",

    "the extent to which the wave forces may alter the ion flows can be obtained only through a self - consistent modeling by using , e.g. , the iterative approach adopted by @xcite : the wave equation  ( [ num_eqs ] ) and the solar wind equations  ( [ bkg_nk ] ) to ( [ bkg_ps ] ) incorporating the wave contribution are solved alternately until a convergence is met . as a first step , however , we may simply evaluate the ion speeds @xmath310 ( @xmath29 ) corrected for the wave force , i.e. , @xmath311 figure  [ fig_ucorr ] presents the radial distribution of both @xmath312 and @xmath313 for all the frequencies considered .",
    "the background flow speed profiles are also plotted for comparison .",
    "one may see that , with the present choice of the wave amplitude , the waves have negligible effects on the ion acceleration below the alfvn point . beyond the alfvn point",
    ", the effects introduced by the waves on the speed profiles become more important , especially in the low frequency case . as a matter of fact , for @xmath8  @xmath6  the corrected proton speed @xmath312 reaches 785  @xmath176  at 1  au where the background value is 648  @xmath176 . as for the alpha speed ,",
    "@xmath313 becomes negative beyond 100  @xmath5  due to the significant deceleration exerted on the alphas by the waves .",
    "of course , such a situation will not appear in reality .",
    "what will happen is that the protons are accelerated whereas alphas are decelerated by the low frequency waves until the ions move at nearly identical speeds .",
    "the net effect of low - frequency waves is thus to limit the speed difference between the protons and alpha particles at large distances .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that in these regions the net work done by the low - frequency wave on the solar wind as a whole is negligible : @xmath314 and @xmath77 is nearly divergence free as discussed in reference to fig.[fig_ewfw ] .",
    "this study has been motivated by the apparent lack of a non - wkb analysis of alfvn waves in a multi - fluid solar wind with differentially flowing ions . to be more specific , this study",
    "is concerned with the propagation of dissipationless , hydromagnetic ( angular frequency @xmath10 well below ion gyro - frequencies ) , purely toroidal alfvn waves that propagate in a background 3-fluid solar wind comprised of electrons , protons and alpha particles .",
    "azimuthal symmetry is assumed throughout .",
    "no assumption has been made that the wavelength is small compared with the spatial scales at which the background flow parameters vary .",
    "the wave behavior at a given @xmath10 is governed by equation  ( [ num_eqs ] ) , which is derived from the general transport equations in the five - moment approximation . the alfvnic point , where the combined alfvn mach number @xmath0 ( cf .",
    "eq.([def_mt2 ] ) ) , is a singular point of equation  ( [ num_eqs ] ) and a regularity condition has to be imposed . for the other boundary condition",
    ", we impose a velocity amplitude of 10  @xmath176  at the coronal base ( 1  @xmath5 ) . for the given background model of a realistic low - latitude fast solar wind , equation  ( [ num_eqs ] ) is integrated numerically for three representative angular frequencies @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3  @xmath6  to yield the radial distribution of the wave energy and energy flux densities as well as the wave - induced acceleration exerted on ion species .    the first conclusion concerns the applicability of the wkb approximation . between 1  @xmath5 and 1  au ,",
    "the numerical solutions show substantial deviation from the wkb expectations . even for the relatively high frequency @xmath1",
    "@xmath6 , a wkb - like behavior can be seen only in regions where @xmath7  @xmath5 . in the low - frequency case @xmath8  @xmath6 ,",
    "the computed profiles of wave - related parameters show a spatial dependence that is distinct from the wkb one , the deviation being particularly pronounced in interplanetary space . in the inner corona @xmath9",
    "@xmath5 , the computed ion velocity fluctuations are considerably smaller than the wkb expectations in all cases , as is the computed wave - induced acceleration exerted on protons or alpha particles .",
    "as for the wave energy and energy flux densities , they can be enhanced or depleted compared with the wkb results , depending on @xmath10 .",
    "the second conclusion is concerned with how the wave acceleration may alter the background flow parameters . in reference to fig.[fig_ucorr ] , it is found that with the current choice of base wave amplitude , the wave acceleration has little effect on the force balance for protons or alpha particles in the corona .",
    "that is , one has to invoke processes other than the non - wkb wave acceleration to accelerate the ions out of the gravitational potential well of the sun .",
    "however , at large distances beyond the alfvnic point , low - frequency waves may play an important role in the ion dynamics , with the net effect being to equalize the speeds of the two ion species considered .    strictly speaking",
    ", the separation of the flow into fluctuations and a time - independent background implies that the waves are linear .",
    "however , one may have noticed that the wave amplitude @xmath246 at 1  au for @xmath8  s@xmath4  @xmath6  is substantially larger than the background poloidal magnetic field strength ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig_ampltd]a ) . that the transverse magnetic field dominates the poloidal one demands a careful examination of the nonlinear effects other than the wave - induced acceleration . in particular , one needs to look at the generation of secondary waves and structures by the primary alfvn waves through the source terms in the momentum equation .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , in the case of ideal mhd these source terms decrease sufficiently fast with radial distance asymptotically .",
    "consequently , the first - order wave amplitudes are valid provided that the amplitude imposed at the coronal base is sufficiently small .",
    "the basic picture is expected to be the same even if a second ion species is included , although a similar discussion in the 3-fluid framework will be complicated by the richness of wave modes due to the differential proton - alpha streaming ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as has been mentioned in the introduction , alfvn waves are dissipated in some way , and this dissipation of the primary waves should be described self - consistently . a possibility to do this is to perform a full elssser  analysis extended to the multi - fluid case , and to express the dissipation in terms of the amplitudes of counter - propagating waves .",
    "we note that this already complicated issue will become even trickier considering the necessity to apportion the dissipated wave energy among different species .    in closing , we note that the low - frequency waves may also be important for outflows from stars other than the sun .",
    "for instance , in the radiatively driven stellar winds , these waves will provide a further channel of momentum exchange between passive ions and line - absorbing ions in addition to the coulomb friction .",
    "this possibility was first pointed out by @xcite in connection with the effects of stellar rotation .",
    "due to the clear resemblance between the low - frequency alfvn waves and stellar rotation ( cf .",
    "section  [ sec_zero_freq ] ) , their discussion also applies to the case where the star persistently emits alfvn waves with frequencies lower than the critical one defined by equation  ( [ def_omegac ] ) .",
    "consequently , the mass loss rate may be significantly altered .",
    "a quantitative study of this effect is beyond the scope of the present paper though .",
    "this research is supported by a pparc rolling grant to the university of wales aberystwyth .",
    "we thank shadia rifai habbal for her careful reading of the first draft , and hui - nan zheng for helpful discussions ."
