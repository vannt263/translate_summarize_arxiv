    "we present the positions ( in the gsc 2.2 frame ) of exo 1745 - 248 , the nine additional globular cluster sources , and the four serendipitous sources ( with relative positional errors from wavdetect ) in table 1 , along with the background - subtracted counts in three bands .",

    "we estimate an error of 01 in the shift to the gsc 2.2 frame , based on the scatter of the two stars used in the boresighting .",
    "an additional error of 037 ( following egc01 ) is incurred in the shift between the gsc 2.2 and nicmos frames .",
    "combining these with the 02 centering positional uncertainty gives an error for the position in the nicmos frame of 04 .",
    "this error circle is fortuitously free of bright red giants .",
    "error circles for six other x - ray sources in the cluster lie wholly or partially within the nic2 field of view .",
    "comparison of the f110w and f187w images with a ratio image ( figure 3 ) shows a significantly blue faint star ( hereafter star a ) within the error circle , only 02 from the corrected position of exo 1745 - 248 . a combination of this star and another star just above it ( star b ) was shown in the cleaned cmd of egc01 ( their figure 8) as one of only two stars that lie more than 3@xmath13 to the blue from the distribution of stars in that color - magnitude diagram .",
    "our attempts at separate psf - fitting using allstar in daophot encountered two problems : ( 1 ) we were unable to fit stars a and b simultaneously and ( 2 ) the sky - fitting component in phot and allstar gave local sky ( background ) values that were too high , because stars a and b are surrounded by a ring of bright stars .",
    "the latter is a formidable problem in this crowded field , especially in f187w where the background contribution of neighboring red giants is greater than in f110w .",
    "we therefore adopted a customized procedure to estimate the f110w and f187w magnitudes for stars a and b. for sky determination we adopted the mean of the two 2-by-2 pixel regions having the lowest intensity values within an 8 pixel radius of star b. using the f110w and f187w images , and the ratio image , we determined the positions of stars a and b. using psf models and the daophot program addstar to create models for stars a and b we subtracted these models from the two images to produce residual images , while keeping the positions of stars a and b fixed .",
    "since no other close - by stars are obviously present , stars a and b are accurately modeled if the mean aperture counts ( after subtracting the sky ) at their positions in the residual image are equal to zero .",
    "we iteratively varied the magnitudes of these two stars until this goal was met .",
    "the results of these fits are shown in the lower right - hand corner of figure 3 .",
    "clearly the subtractions of stars a and b were successful , given the relatively smooth residuals .",
    "we performed aperture photometry on the residual images to produce photometry that is consistent with figure 8 of egc01 .",
    "photometry for stars a and b were measured by subtracting off stars b and a respectively , and the results are shown in figure 4 .",
    "variables 1 and 2 from egc01 are labeled with crosses , and stars within 1 \" of x - ray sources are circled . the main - sequence turnoff",
    "( not reached at the cluster core ) is at f110w@xmath26 ( clg02 ) .",
    "note the apparently blue color of star a ( @xmath27 from the subgiant sequence ) lying near the top of the blue straggler sequence .",
    "the error in the color of star a is dominated by the error in the f187w magnitude .",
    "the high sky background in f187w caused the original f187w magnitude determination for the combination of stars a and b to be too low , and thus shifted the combination bluewards .",
    "our customized procedure thus gives redder colors for both stars a and b than the original determination for the combination .",
    "given the blue appearance of star a in both the normal and residual images , the reasonable evidence for blue colors in our photometric analysis , and its proximity to the center of the x - ray error circle , star a is a reasonable candidate for the ir counterpart to exo 1745 - 248 .",
    "no evidence is seen for statistically significant variability of star a , but the faintness of star a and its strong blending with star b limits the depth of variability searches .",
    "only the f110w images are useful for time series analysis , and only sparse coverage was obtained here over 1.16 days .",
    "images in the @xmath28 and @xmath29 passbands with the advanced camera ( in high resolution mode ) on should do a much better job of separating stars a and b and would provide much better constraints on variability if taken at several different epochs near outburst and quiescence .    since the f187w band does not correspond to any ground - based filter , standard calibrations for it do not exist .",
    "we apply rough transformations to estimate interesting quantities .",
    "we estimate the unreddened j magnitude from the f110w and f187w magnitudes by the equation    @xmath30    derived assuming that the spectral slope is constant over this range . using @xmath31=0.282 and @xmath32=6.75 ( clg02 ) ,",
    "we find @xmath33=16.40 , @xmath34=1.7 .",
    "we calculate the color ( f110w - f187w)@xmath35= @xmath36 . assuming that the photometry is accurate , three alternatives to an lmxb nature remain for this star",
    ": it could be a blue horizontal branch star , it could be a blue straggler , or it could be a foreground star .",
    "we plot simple interpolated blue straggler and horizontal branch sequences in figure 4 .",
    "star a s position may be consistent with that of a blue horizontal branch star , although a blue horizontal branch has only been hinted at in terzan 5 ( clg02 ) .",
    "it is also consistent with an extremely heavy ( more than twice the turnoff mass ) blue straggler , or a blue straggler binary ( as variable 2 from egc01 , plotted as an `` x '' next to star a in figure 4 , may be ) .",
    "the other extremely blue star seen in figure 4 is probably a foreground star , which also can not be excluded as a possibility for star a. however , the chance of one of the five bluest stars in the 192 square nic2 fov landing in the 04 error circle by chance is only @xmath37 .",
    "none of the stars in the other x - ray error circles ( circled in figure 4 ) display any unusual colors or variability .",
    "this is expected based upon the magnitudes of cvs and quiescent lmxbs , in the field and other globular clusters , which very rarely reach the turnoff magnitude ( grindlay et al .  2001a , b , pooley et al .",
    "2002a ) .",
    "we compare this suggested counterpart to other low - mass x - ray binaries observed in the infrared by calculating the ratio of x - ray to infrared luminosity . using the asm lightcurve in figure 1 , we see that the average asm countrate for the 11 days leading up to the observation was @xmath38 cts s@xmath2 , compared to 5.3@xmath7 cts s@xmath2 at the time of the observation .",
    "the high source confusion near the galactic center for the asm makes this data relatively noisy , so we take 1.5 cts s@xmath2 as an upper limit on the x - ray flux . assuming the same spectrum as we find in 2000 ( see sect .",
    "2.5 ) , we derive an unabsorbed 0.5 - 10 kev x - ray flux of @xmath39 ergs @xmath21 s@xmath2 and an unabsorbed j - band flux of @xmath40 ergs @xmath21 s@xmath2 , thus log(@xmath41)@xmath423.7 .",

    "infrared colors observed by wachter ( 1998 ) give an even broader range ( @xmath52 ) , as some lmxbs are dominated by the disk light in the ir , while others are dominated by the light of the secondary .",
    "this makes identification of lmxbs by infrared colors very difficult , and leaves our identification uncertain .",
    "we extracted the numbers of counts within 1  radius of the sources ( containing 90% of source flux at 1.5 kev ) in the 0.5 - 1.5 , 0.5 - 4.5 , and 1.5 - 6 kev bands .",

    "the luminosities of the two populations roughly agree with the range observed for their respective counterparts in 47 tuc and ngc 6440 .",
    "this suggests that the soft population ( w2 , w3 , w4 , w8 ) should be identified with qlmxbs containing neutron stars and that the harder population is composed of bright cvs .",

    "therefore it seems likely that terzan 5 s msps were formed early in its history , as were those in 47 tuc ( grindlay et al .",
    "2002 ) , which has a roughly similar inferred ratio ( @xmath138 ) of msps to qlmxbs .",
    "we have presented a reasonable infrared candidate to exo 1745 - 248 in terzan 5 , identified by its blue color and positional coincidence with the boresighted position .",
    "we have assembled a broad x - ray spectrum using a simultaneous observation and the spectrum from the readout streak , slightly altering the energy scale of the readout spectrum to account for observed gain variation during the readout .",
    "we utilized the empirical comparisons of spo01 to indicate that this lmxb appears similar to other ultracompact lmxbs in globular clusters , suggesting that exo 1745 - 248 is the fifth ultracompact lmxb known in a globular cluster .",
    "we also identify a broad , strong 6.55 kev iron line , the strongest ( ew=188@xmath139 ev ) yet discovered in a globular cluster lmxb , with an accompanying smeared @xmath140 kev iron edge .",
    "the superb resolution of has allowed us to identify nine faint x - ray sources within 30  of an lmxb in outburst in terzan 5 .",
    "spectral fitting with bremsstrahlung and powerlaw models , and a neutron star hydrogen atmosphere model ( lloyd 2003 ) , suggests that four of these sources are qlmxbs , while five are candidate cvs .",
    "artificial point source testing suggests that we are missing @xmath830% of the sources in the range @xmath141 ergs s@xmath2 due to the presence of the lmxb in outburst .",
    "this implies a total cluster population of @xmath142 sources with @xmath143 ergs s@xmath2 ( excluding the lmxb ) .",
    "a recalculation of the central density of terzan 5 from updated cluster parameters gives log(@xmath127)=5.23 , suggesting that terzan 5 is not the richest of the globular clusters in stellar encounter products and is not as dynamically unstable as previously thought ( clg02 ) .",
    "thus we find that the numbers of x - ray sources in terzan 5 are consistent with the numbers discovered in other globular clusters and the currently favored formation methods .",
    "upcoming observations of terzan 5 and ngc 6440 ( pi : r. wijnands ) will allow us to better constrain the variability and spectra of the qlmxbs in those clusters . @xmath28 and @xmath29 observations of terzan 5 , with the advanced camera for surveys in hrc mode at times when exo 1745 - 248 is in outburst vs. quiescence ,",
    "could unambiguously verify the identification proposed here .    c. h. thanks j.  m. miller , r. wijnands , t. gaetz , r.  k. smith , r. edgar , and the anonymous referee for useful comments that have improved this paper .",
