    "since the concept of entanglement[@xmath0 was introduced into quantum physics , it plays an important roles in quantum information theory .",
    "nearly all of quantum information processes are based on entangled state such as quantum code[@xmath1 , quantum swapping[@xmath2 , quantum teleportation[@xmath3 and so on .    in the quantum information theory",
    "some calculations are very complex .",
    "for example , in quantum teleportation  we must write out all the joint states , and need to find out the relation between the _ alice _",
    "s joint _ bell _ states measured results and the receiver _ bob _ s local operation for his particle .",
    "furthermore , if we perform a teleptortation of @xmath4-dimension state , the calculations are tremendous !",
    "evenmore we make a series of @xmath5-dimensional quantum entanglement swapping , the calculations are very difficult .",
    "we have introduced a kind of notation[@xmath6 , which was represented in ref.[@xmath7 , for quantum teleportation . in that paper",
    ", we give a powerful theorem for general teleportation , by which one can easily construct _ bob _ s operation .    in this paper",
    "we generalize the notation to much more quantum information process . by using this tool ,",
    "we give a new criteria for _ schmidt _ decomposition of entangled state . in terms of this criteria",
    "we need not to calculate partial inner - product for the joint density operator",
    ".    this notation can simplify calculation of quantum swapping include series quantum swapping ,    as we know , notation is often used in physics , it can simplify some calculation just as dirac sign does . here",
    "we try to make following notation for quantum information .",
    "in the paper[@xmath6,we introduced a notation for quantum teleportation , which is defined as follows ,    let @xmath8 be a finite _ hilbert _ space , and @xmath9 , so @xmath5-partite _ hilbert _ space @xmath10 .",
    "we definite some useful notations @xmath11    @xmath12 ,    @xmath13 ,    @xmath14 .",
    "let set @xmath15 be a group of orthonormal complete basis of the @xmath16-th _ hilbert _ space @xmath17 .",
    "so an arbitrary state @xmath18 can be written as @xmath19 ( where superscrip @xmath20 means transposition ) .",
    "arbitrary bipartite state @xmath21 can be written as @xmath22 @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a known matrix @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the transposed of @xmath27 . if we perform a local operation @xmath28 on particle @xmath29 , the state become @xmath30 @xmath31 , and it is @xmath32 @xmath33 with local operation @xmath34 .",
    "we will find the merits of this notation from the following discussion .",
    "the phenomenon of entanglement is a remarkable feature of quantum theory .",
    "it play a crucial role in the discussions of quantum mechanics and quantum information theory .",
    "the entangled states are important for quantum information theory .",
    "in particular , the pure bipartite entangled state @xmath35 is used in most quantum information transported process such as quantum teleportation , quantum code et al .",
    "so how to find out the pbes from pbs(pure bipartite state ) is important .",
    "as we know , any pure bipartite entangled state can be expressed as _ schmidt _",
    "decomposition , so the criteria for pure bipartite entangled state is , if the _",
    "number of the pure bipartite state is more than one . by the notation",
    ", a pure bipartite state @xmath36 can be described as    @xmath37    where all entangled information are included in the matrix @xmath27 .",
    "here we proposed a criteria for this .",
    "@xmath38 @xmath39 _ the state _",
    "@xmath36 _ _  is entangled state , if and only if there are more than one non - zero eigenvalues of the matrix _ _",
    "@xmath40,_the number of the non - zero eigenvalues _ is _ just _ _ schmidt _ _ number_.    _ _ proof__@xmath11as we know , any bipartite entangled state can be written as _",
    "decomposition , namely    @xmath41    the joint density operator is    @xmath42    and the density operator of the qubit @xmath29 is    @xmath43    we can calculate out the eigenvalues of @xmath44    @xmath45    where @xmath46 and _ schmidt _ number @xmath47 then the state @xmath48 is entangled state , namely there are more than two non - zero eigenvalue of the state @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath49    let @xmath50where @xmath51 with @xmath52 , considered @xmath53 , we can get all @xmath54",
    ". so @xmath55 is known .",
    "@xmath56 @xmath57    from this criteria we not only can get the _",
    "number of the state , but also can find out the _ schmidt _ decomposition expression for the state .",
    "@xmath38 @xmath58 _ the state _ @xmath36 _ _",

    "there must be matrix @xmath59 , @xmath60 with @xmath61    @xmath62    and    @xmath63    so    @xmath64    with @xmath65 .",
    "finally we can easily get    @xmath66    @xmath57",
    "quantum information attracted more attention since quantum teleportation has been proposed .",
    "quantum swapping is important in quantum information .",
    "but there are some complicated calculation in quantum cryptography[@xmath67 and quantum swapping , furthermore multi - dimension teleportation or series of swapping , while by this notation , all of this kinds of calculation become easy .      as we know , any quantum information process is based on entangled state . if sender and receiver do not share any common entangled state , how they to communicate each other ?",
    "the answer is that they can make a quantum swapping through another person as follow .",
    "_ alice _ ( sender ) has a entangled states @xmath68 , _",
    "bob_(receiver ) has a entangled states @xmath69 , _ alice _",
    "send qubit @xmath5 to charley(the third person ) and _ bob _ send a qubit @xmath70 to him , then charley make a joint measurement on qubit @xmath5 and @xmath70 , he told _",

    "however we can overcome this problem by a series quantum swapping as shown in the fig @xmath29 ( where @xmath84 means the @xmath85-th epr pairs , and the @xmath86 is the @xmath85-th joint measerment ) .",
    "the calculation of the series quantum swapping is very complex even @xmath4 is a large number , but by the notation , the calculation become concise .",
    "@xmath87      earlier studies have been confined to the teleportation of single - body quantum states @xcite , which is only a special case .",
    "recently teleportation of multi - body quantum states was attracted more  attentions[@xmath88-@xmath89 , the studies are only confined to teleportation of bipartite entangled state . in this paper we study on how to teleport a bipartite states by two epr states based by the notation[@xmath6 , and construct bob s local operation .",
