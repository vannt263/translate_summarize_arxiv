    "we have designed a toy brain with the model described in @xcite , and have simulated it on the computer in c++ language .",
    "the purpose of this exercise is to simulate neurons by calculating their internal voltage , including their ion pumps , synapses with neurotransmitters , electrochemical action pulses that propagate with finite speed along the axons and dendrites , and the `` @xcite that alters the strengths of the synapses so that the brain can learn .",
    "we have simulated excitatory synapses with glutamate neurotransmitter , and inhibitory synapses with gaba neurotransmitter.@xcite these synapses can release neurotransmitters fast or slow .",
    "we have used known circuits of the brain wherever possible,@xcite or at least circuits that the brain may plausibly use .",
    "the toy brain can learn languages , _",
    "e.g. _ english and spanish , without mixing them into '' .",
    "we have designed a plausible structure of the brain , including parallel and series hierarchical learning and recognition , with long and short term memory at the higher levels of the hierarchy .",
    "the toy brain is flexible , modular , asynchronous , has distributed processing ( _ i.e. _ no central control ) , and its neurons have critical learning periods .",
    "this toy brain has a little over 12 thousand neurons and 70 million synapses .",
    "the block diagram of the toy brain is described in section 2 . then follow descriptions of the blocks , neurons , results , and the possible relation of the toy brain with a real brain .",
    "conclusions are collected at the end .",
    "to be specific we will describe the particular toy brain shown in figure [ block ] .",
    "are constants of the c++ program and can be set at will .",
    "we have tried other brain topologies , but limit the discussion to the particular one shown in the figure . ]",
    "this toy brain can learn up to 36 letters of 8 bits , 500 words of 4 letters , and 10,000 phrases of 4 words .",
    "this brain reads a book in english , or spanish , or whatever .",
    "the text is parsed into phrases of 4 words .",
    "each word is truncated to the first 4 letters ( if the word is shorter than 4 letters it is padded with spaces ) .",
    "each letter is coded into 8 bits with 4 ones and 4 zeroes .",
    "the toy brain has 4 hierarchical levels called `` , '' , `` and '' .",
    "the `` neurons learn patterns of 8 bits , the '' neurons learn patterns of 4 letters , and the \" neurons learn patterns of 4 words .    `` and '' are accessible to short term memory,@xcite _ i.e. _ if a `` neuron fires it causes the corresponding four '' neurons to fire after a delay , which , in turn , cause the `` neuron to fire again .",
    "note the double arrows in figure [ block ] .",
    "these synchronized firings cease after about ten seconds ( the duration of short term memory which is settable ) because each of these neurons has an auxiliary neuron that integrates ( counts ) pulses until it reaches its threshold , and then inhibits the main neuron with a slow inhibiting ( gaba ) synapsis .",
    "thus , according to the model of @xcite , the '' acquires the composite `` of its 4 . '' and \" are not accessible to short term memory , _",
    "i.e. _ they do not have feedback circuits to sustain repeated firings of the neurons .",
    "note the single arrows in figure [ block ] .",
    "the brain reads the book one word at a time .",
    "the 4 letters of the word are learned and recognized in parallel . to recognize a phrase of 4 words ,",
    "the toy brain learns and recognizes the 4 words in series ( _ i.e. _ one at a time ) .",
    "each block of word neurons is activated sequentially by one auxiliary neuron that counts the words ( shown only for the first and last word blocks in figure [ block ] ) .",
    "these auxiliary neurons are reset due to the lapse of time between one phrase and the next .",
    "all blocks in figure [ block ] are similar .",
    "let us describe the first block with 36 `` neurons .",
    "four of these neurons are shown in figure [ letter ] .",
    "each '' neuron has ( initially ) 8 inputs corresponding to the 8 bits defining the first letter of a word , and one output connected to 2000 word neurons .",
    "the neurons can be in one of three modes : inactive mode , learning mode , or recognition mode .",
    "initially , all neurons in the block are in inactive mode , except for neuron `` which is in learning mode .",
    "a '' with 4 ones and 4 zeroes is presented to the first block of 36 `` neurons",
    ". neuron '' fires and learns this letter by strengthening the corresponding 4 synapses and breaking the other 4 .",
    "this is the hebb mechanism.@xcite neuron `` passes to recognition mode , and tells neuron '' to pass to learning mode .",
    "this signal is shown with a dashed arrow in figure [ letter ] .",
    "note that neuron `` has reached its critical period for learning . before learning ,",
    "a '' neuron has 8 inputs .",
    "after learning , only 4 inputs survive ( with synapses with strengthened couplings ) .",
    "the output of each neuron has an inhibitory ( gaba ) connection to an input of each succeeding neuron of the block .",
    "these fast inhibiting connections ( shown only for neuron \" in figure [ letter ] , see dotted lines ) prevent several neurons in the block from learning the same letter , and also make the design of the brain more robust , since , for blocks with short term memory , only one neuron per block can fire repeatedly at any time .",
    "let us now consider the @xmath0th `` neuron in a block of 500 words , see figure [ block ] .",
    "this neuron and associated circuitry is shown in figure [ word ] . before learning ,",
    "a '' neuron has @xmath1 input connection from `` neurons . after learning ,",
    "only 4 of these connections are left ( with synapses with strengthened coupling ) .",
    "a '' neuron has the same circuits of a `` neuron , plus one added circuit .",
    "to turn off the repeated firings of neuron '' ( due to the feedback loops between `` neurons and '' neurons ) there is a connection from the output of neuron `` to one of its inputs _ via _ an auxiliary neuron .",
    "this auxiliary neuron has a long time constant to return to its resting voltage , so it integrates ( counts ) its input pulses until it reaches its threshold voltage .",
    "the output synapse of the auxiliary neuron is inhibitory and releases gaba neurotransmitter slowly , so it turns off the repeated firings of neuron '' after about 10 seconds ( settable ) .",
    "such positive and negative feedback circuits have been observed in real brains.@xcite    the other difference between `` blocks and '' blocks is that the former learn in parallel , while the latter learn in series . to implement the series learning of words",
    "we need a control that activates one word block after another .",
    "this is accomplished with one auxiliary neuron per block .",
    "this auxiliary neuron has a long time constant and integrates ( counts ) the words of the phrase and fires to synchronize these words .",
    "the first \" block learns the first word of a phrase , the second block learns the second word of the phrase , and so on .",
    "the words are synchronized by the lapse of time between one phrase and the next .",
    "the simulated neurons have a resting voltage -0.06 volt .",
    "ion pumps make the voltage of the neuron approach the resting voltage with a time constant @xmath2 , which is a settable parameter .",
    "the neurons have a threshold voltage -0.04 volt .",
    "when the internal voltage of the neuron surpasses this threshold , an action pulse is produced ( due to fast sodium and slow potassium voltage activated ion channels ) with a time distribution taken from @xcite .",
    "synapses are defined by the following parameters : voltage step @xmath3 into the target neuron with a settable time distribution ( the injection of charge into the target neuron can be faster or slower ) , and delay @xmath4 of associated dentrite and axon . if @xmath5 , the synapse is excitatory . if @xmath6 , the synapse is inhibitory .    finally ,",
    "if the neuron is in the learning state , then the @xmath3 of all inputs that cause the neuron to fire are increases by @xmath7 , and the @xmath3 of all other inputs are set to zero ( effectively disconnecting these synapses ) .    real neurons must have adjusted these parameters ( by learning from experience and/or by evolution ) .",
    "the toy brain has learned ( in the sense described in this note ) spanish by reading \" by gabriel garca marquez . to show the level of detail of the simulation , we present in figure [ pulses ] the internal voltage of three neurons : the neuron that counts the fourth word in a phrase , a phrase neuron that recognizes four words , and the auxiliary neuron that turns this word neuron off after a delay .",
    "note that the neurons have a resting voltage of -0.06 volt , and a threshold voltage of -0.04 volt .",
    "note that when the phrase neuron fires , the feedback loops cause it to fire repeatedly , until the auxiliary shut - off neurons turn this oscillation off .",
    "note , in the top and middle graphs , the four steps ( corresponding to the four words ) required to reach the threshold voltage of these neurons .",
    "let us put our toy brain in a more familiar setting .",
    "we will add one more hierarchical level : call it `` . for the sake of brevity we will consider only the nine neurons shown in figure [ my_world ] : one '' neuron called `` , two '' neurons called `` and '' , five `` neurons called '' , `` , '' , `` and '' , and one `` neuron called '' .",
    "the toy brain has many other neurons and another hierarchical level ( \") that we will not consider .",
    "the connections shown in figure [ my_world ] have been learned by prior experience of the toy brain .",
    "now suppose i am discussing consciousness with a friend .",
    "my eyes see her and my ears hear her , and my brain recognizes her eyes , her mouth and her voice ( meaning that the `` , '' and `` neurons fire ) . the firing of these neurons cause the '' neuron to fire , so i have recognized her face .",
    "feedback loops cause repeated firings of these neurons , binding together those eyes , that mouth and that voice to form her face .    in a real brain",
    ", the neurons in the upper hierarchies are associated with awareness .",
    "we assume that `` neurons have no awareness , '' neurons have awareness and are not accessible from short term memory ( see the single ended arrow in figure [ my_world ] ) , and `` , '' and \" neurons have awareness and are accessible from short term memory .",
    "so now , in a real brain , i am aware of that face with those eyes , that mouth and that voice",
    ".    my eyes also see my hands .",
    "my brain recognizes these hands , meaning that the `` neuron fires .",
    "also , a neuron in my tooth causes the '' neuron to fire , which in turn causes the `` neuron to fire .",
    "the firing of the '' neuron and the `` neuron cause the '' neuron to fire , so i have recognized my self .",
    "feedback loops cause repeated firings of these neurons , tying me together , so now i am aware of my self with these hands and this tooth ache with that pain .",
    "the firing of the `` and '' neurons in turn cause the firing of the `` neuron .",
    "feedback loops now cause eight neurons to fire synchronously , tying my world together , so now i become aware of my world with her face ( with those eyes , that mouth and that voice ) and me ( with these hands and this tooth ache with that pain ) .",
    "the '' neuron is not part of the feedback loops , so the pain goes away as soon as the dentist lifts that awful hook .",
    "of course this model and description are over simplified , but they give a general idea of what might be going on in a real brain . laking an understanding of the three difficult phenomena : awareness , attention and free will ( if indeed we have free will ! ) , we present the following speculations as a working hypothesis to help guide experiments .    * hypothesis : * from a certain hierarchical level on up wards :    1 .",
    "awareness is the dynamic set of firing neurons . 2 .",
    "somehow , i can excite a neuron ( by free will ? ) .",
    "3 .   somehow , i can inhibit all neurons belonging to a hierarchical level ( by free will ? ) .",
    "if ( by hypothesis 2 ) i excite , for example , the neuron `` , then feedback loops make '' , `` , '' and `` to fire repeatedly in synchronism . in this way",
    "i have brought the image of that face ( with those eyes , that mouth and that voice ) from long term memory and have re - lived it in short term memory .",
    "note that if i excite the '' neuron i can remember myself with these hands and this tooth ache , but i can ( fortunately ) not feel the pain of that tooth ache from memory ( because the \" neuron is not within the feedback loops and can not be excited from memory ) .    to focus attention on",
    ", for example , her eyes , i must inhibit all `` neurons except '' . a way to do that is to inhibit all `` neurons ( hypothesis 3 ) and excite the '' neuron ( hypothesis 2 ) .",
    "ren descartes divided the world into _ res extensa _",
    "( matter ) and _ res cogitans _ ( mind ) .",
    "the problem with this division is that it leaves out the interaction of matter on mind , and mind on matter .",
    "may we suggest identifying `` with the '' ( in the upper hierarchical levels of processing ) .",
    "then the interaction of matter on mind ( _ via _ synapsis from sense cells to neurons ) , and mind on matter ( _ via _ synapsis from neurons to muscles ) becomes clear .",
    "let us repeat hypothesis 1 : awareness is the dynamic set of firing neurons ( in the upper hierarchical levels of processing ) .",
    "this set of firing neurons is determined by inputs from the senses and/or memory ( hypothesis 2 ) , and/or attention ( hypothesis 2 and 3 ) , and a lifelong learning process that programmed the strengths of the couplings at the synapses ( and other parameters of neurons and synapses ) , and is partially sustained for a few seconds by feedback loops . according to hypothesis 1 ,",
    "we have identified what i am aware of with the set of firing neurons .",
    "the pain of the tooth is a set of firing neurons . who / what feels that pain : a grander set of firing neurons .",
    "the sight of her face is a pattern of firing neurons . who / what sees her face :",
    "a grander set of firing neurons .",
    "the awareness of my world is a set of firing neurons .",
    "what / who has that awareness : that same pattern of firing neurons .",
    "if we define `` as what i am aware of , then '' am a dynamic set of firing neurons , sustained by the organization of my brain , the organization of my body , and by the world",
    ".    our toy brain does not understand what it reads , for the same reason i do not understand a book in polish ( i would have understood the book if my mother would have been polish ) . for the toy brain to understand , it is necessary ( but hardly sufficient ) to equip it with sensors and hands so it can explore the world , and give it a \" to teach it the names of the things in the world .",
    "would the toy brain then wake up to awareness ?",
    "we have designed and developed a toy brain that runs on a personal computer .",
    "this toy brain is flexible , modular , has hierarchical learning and recognition , has short and long term memory , is distributed ( _ i.e. _ has no central control ) , is asynchronous , and includes parallel and series processing .",
    "we have simulated the neurons calculating their internal voltages as a function of time .",
