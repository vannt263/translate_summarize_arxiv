    "optical bloch equations ( obes ) are the most widely used time - dependent equations for light - atom interaction in quantum optics @xcite , with which the stimulated absorption , stimulated emission , and spontaneous emission of light by atoms are well described , and the spectroscopy and rabi problem of atoms can be studied well .",
    "the obes play the central role in both the semi - classical models and the quantum models such as jaynes - cummings model @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is @xmath0 , which is restricted by the _ electric dipole approximation _ ( eda ) .",
    "such approximation is a combination of two individual approximations .",
    "the first one is the dipole approximation , which requires that the radius of an atom @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) is much less than the wavelength of the light @xmath3 , @xmath4 the second approximation neglects the coupling between the atoms and the magnetic field of the light @xmath5 due to that it is much smaller than the coupling between the atoms and the electric field @xmath6 of the light .",
    "therefore , these widely - used obes in quantum optics textbooks are only valid for the interaction between atoms and long - wavelength light .",
    "recent realization of the free - electron lasers that work on x - ray wavelengths @xcite ( although only femtosecond pulses are available at present ) provides an opportunity for the experimental study the time evolution of atoms in monochromatic x - ray beam . with the steady - state solutions ( @xmath7 , with @xmath8 being the lift - time of the excited state ) and instantaneous solutions ( @xmath9 ) of obes one can study the spectroscopy of atoms in continues - wave ( cw ) laser and the rabi problem of atoms in ultrafast laser pulse ( such as femtosecond pulses ) , respectively .",
    "such obes are different from the x - ray scattering theories @xcite due to that the obes are time - dependent which study the evolution of the system , while the x - ray scattering theories study the time - independent initial and final states of the system .",
    "however , the wavelength of x - ray ( @xmath10 to @xmath11 ) does not satisfy the dipole approximation condition ( @xmath12 ) , which makes the widely - used obes in quantum optics textbooks invalid in studying the interaction between atoms and x - ray laser .",
    "then a new set of obes beyond the electric dipole approximation is required for the spectroscopy and rabi oscillations of atoms in x - ray laser beams .",
    "quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , which is the relativistic quantum field theory for the electromagnetic interaction , studies the light - matter interactions at the fundamental level @xcite .",
    "bound - state qed is the extension of qed which studies the interaction between photons and bound electrons in atoms with the language of qed .",
    "the early bound - state qed models are developed by furry @xcite , salpeter and bethe @xcite , as well as gell - mann and low @xcite to study the bound - state problem in quantum field theory . in the past years",
    ", many bound - state qed models were developed to correct the electrons energy levels in atoms and ions @xcite , including few - electron atoms @xcite and many - electron atoms @xcite . since the interaction hamiltonian in the bound - state qed models",
    "does not have the eda , it can describe the interaction between the bound electrons in atoms and the light at all wavelength .",
    "then it is interesting to ask a question that whether a new set of obes can be derived directly form the interaction hamiltonian in bound - state qed ?",
    "if so , such obes can get rid of the eda in order to describe the interaction between atoms and light of arbitrary wavelength , especially to meet the recent development of x - ray laser .    in this paper , we start from the minimal - coupling hamiltonian density between the bound - state dirac field and the free electromagnetic field in bound - state qed to derive the new style of obes .",
    "our new obes can describe a two - level atom interacting with a monochromatic light of arbitrary wavelength , which meet the requirement of studying the spectroscopy and the rabi oscillations of two - level atoms in x - ray laser beams .",
    "our paper is arranged as follows : in section ii , we present the interaction hamiltonian for a light - atom interacting system form the interaction hamiltonian density between bound - state dirac field and free electromagnetic field in bound - state qed , and derive the time - dependent equations of the ground and excited states of a two - level atom in interaction picture . in section iii , we involve the density matrix of the two - level atom and the spontaneous emission of its excited state into the time - dependent equations in last section , and derive the obes for a two - level atom interacting with monochromatic light .",
    "we present how the new obes can describe the spectroscopy and the rabi oscillations of a two - level atom in x - ray laser .",
    "section v is the conclusion of this paper , which also gives the discussions on possible extensions of such new obes .",
    "in the interaction picture , the interaction hamiltonian density of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , which is the minimal - coupling between free dirac field and free electromagnetic field , is @xmath13[i - qed ] with @xmath14 being the dirac field , @xmath15 being the dirac matrices , @xmath16 being the covariant four - potential of the electromagnetic field , and @xmath17 being the elementary charge . the minimal - coupling hamiltonian density for the interaction between the bound - state dirac field and free electromagnetic field in bound - state qed has the similar form @xcite @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the bound - state dirac field which describes the bound electrons in atoms , and @xmath20 is the four - potential of the free electromagnetic field .",
    "quantization of the bound - state dirac field , @xmath19 , is different to it of the free dirac field , @xmath14 .",
    "the reason is that the eigenstates of the bound electrons are the discrete wave functions of energy and angular momentum rather than the continues wave - functions of kinetic energy and momentum for free electrons .",
    "since no positrons exist in atoms , we simplify the furry picture @xcite by removing the creation and annihilation operators of positrons , and only preserving the creation and annihilation operators of electrons .",
    "then the bound - state dirac field for the valence electron in a two - level atom can be canonically quantized as @xmath21 here , @xmath22 is the space - dependent wave - function of the bound electron in the state @xmath23 ( with @xmath24 being the excited state and @xmath25 being the ground state ) , @xmath26 is the external linear momentum of the bound - state dirac field , @xmath27 is the total energy of the bound - state dirac field in the state @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the normalization parameter .",
    "@xmath30/@xmath31 is the creation / annihilation operator of the bound electrons in the state @xmath23 , which obeys the anti - commutation relation @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "the canonical quantized monochromatic electromagnetic field in coulomb gauge can be written @xmath34 with @xmath35 being its wave - vector , @xmath36 being its frequency , @xmath37 being the normalization coefficient , @xmath38 being the vector polarization , and @xmath39 being the creation / annihilation operator of photons which obeys the commutation relation @xmath40=1 $ ] , and @xmath41=[a , a]=0 $ ] . since the angular momentum of a bound electron is fixed at a certain energy level in atoms , we assume that the polarization of the electromagnetic field ( circular or linear polarization ) just fits the requirement of the angular momentum difference ( @xmath42 or @xmath43 transitions ) between @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    ". then @xmath46 can be replaced by @xmath47 for such two - level system .",
    "after the quantization of both bound - state dirac field and monochromatic electromagnetic field , we can integrate eq .",
    "( [ i - b ] ) in the three - dimensional space to obtain the time - dependent interaction hamiltonian @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath49 here we adopt the rotating - wave approximation to ignore the counter - rotating frequency parts @xmath50}$ ] , which is an widely used rational approximation in quantum optics @xcite .",
    "the integrations of @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which show the transition probability between @xmath44 and @xmath45 , can be calculated with the wave - function , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "here we define @xmath55 the the spatial integrations ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) are the key differences between the conventional interaction hamiltonian with eda and the minimal coupling hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ ht ] ) . in the interaction hamiltonians which are based on eda @xcite",
    ", the spatial integrations ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) are not considered due to that the wavefunctions of electrons are localized to the spatial point where the atom is ( @xmath58 ) , then such integration are replaced by localized electric - dipole transition matrix elements ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) at @xmath58 . in the minimal coupling hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ ht ] ) , the integrations can be directly calculated with the wavefunctions of electrons , which is free from the wavelength of light .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ ht ] ) can be used to derive the obes with arbitrary light wavelength . with eq .",
    "( [ int ] ) the time - dependent interaction hamiltonian @xmath48 can be rewritten as @xmath61 this is the bound - state qed based interaction hamiltonian for a two - level atom interacting with photons .     and the excited state @xmath62 , where @xmath17 and @xmath63 are the excited and ground state , respectively .",
    "@xmath64 is the particle number state of the photons , @xmath36 is the frequency of the photons , and @xmath65 is the detuning of the photons to the energy difference between @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",

    "( [ hi ] ) , ( [ state ] ) , and ( [ ip ] ) , we can obtain the time - dependent equations of @xmath71 and @xmath72 , @xmath74 this coupled set of equations describes the rabi oscillation between the two level , @xmath62 and @xmath75 , with the rabi frequency @xmath76    the set of two equations in eq .",
    "( [ rabi ] ) is an ideal model where the spontaneous emission of the excited state is not considered . for a real system of a two - level atom interacting with monochromatic light",
    ", the spontaneous emission of the excited state can not be ignored .",
    "the density matrix of the system is necessary to combine eq .",
    "( [ rabi ] ) and the spontaneous emission into a set of equations , which are just the optical bloch equations ( obes ) .",
    "to derive the obes , we need to introduce the density matrix for the two - level atom interacting with monochromatic light at first .",
    "the density matrix is @xmath77 with @xmath78 being the probability of the atom in the excited state @xmath24 , @xmath79 being the probability of the atom in the ground state @xmath25 , and @xmath80 being the off - diagonal elements which determine the transition between @xmath45 and @xmath44 .",
    "an obvious relation is that @xmath81 .    after introducing the density matrix ,",
    "we need to include the spontaneous emission of the excited state @xmath24 .",
    "the standard theory of spontaneous emission is the weisskopf - wigner theory @xcite , which presents that the spontaneous emission is the result of the interaction between the two level atom at the excited state @xmath44 and the vacuum state of multi - mode electromagnetic field .",
    "the former interaction hamiltonian in weisskopf - wigner theory is also based on the electric dipole approximation ( eda ) . in principle , we can rewrite the weisskopf - wigner theory with the minimal - coupling hamiltonian of the bound - state qed @xmath82 and the initial state of the system @xmath83 such new form of weisskopf - wigner theory can get rid of the eda .",
    "however , this work is worth to do in the future and we do not to present it here . in this paper , we adopt a constant @xmath68 as the spontaneous emission rate of the excited state @xmath84 ( then the lifetime of the excited state becomes @xmath85 ) , which is the widely - used approach in quantum optics @xcite .    now with eq .",
    "( [ rabi ] ) and @xmath68 , we can write the time - evolution equations for every element of the density matrix , which are @xmath86^*\\\\ & = \\frac{i}{\\hbar}q^*\\sqrt{n+1}(\\rho_{ee}-\\rho_{gg})-(i\\delta+\\frac{\\gamma}{2})\\tilde{\\rho}_{ge}.\\label{obe } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath87 , and @xmath88 . the equations in eq .",
    "( [ obe ] ) are our bound - state qed based obes for a two - level atom interacting with monochromatic light of arbitrary wavelength .",
    "we obtain these equations from the interaction hamiltonian , eq .  ( [ hi ] ) , which is directly derived from the interaction hamiltonian density between a bound electron and a monochromatic electromagnetic field in bound - state qed .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ obe ] ) is the set of obes beyond the eda . comparing with the former obes that derived from jaynes - cummings model @xcite ,",
    "the brief change of our obes is that the rabi frequency under the eda is replaced by the @xmath89 , where @xmath56 is the spatial integration of all space - dependent wave - functions of both photons and bound electrons ( see eq .",
    "( [ int ] ) ) .",
    "this is the reason why our bound - state qed based obes are free from any spatial approximation , including the eda .     of the two - level atom with @xmath90 in the steady - state limit ( @xmath91 ) , with @xmath92 being the detuning of the light and @xmath68 being the spontaneous emission rate .",
    "the solid ( black ) line is for photon number @xmath93 , and the dashed ( red ) line is for the photon number @xmath94 .",
    "since the intensity of the monochromatic light is proportional to its photon number @xmath64 in the particle number representation , a larger @xmath64 leads to a larger maximum value and a larger full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the @xmath95,width=340 ]    .[absorption ]    a very useful solution of eq.([obe ] ) is the steady - state solution of @xmath95 under the condition @xmath96 .",
    "the steady - state solutions of @xmath95 and @xmath97 are @xmath98 fig .",
    "[ absorption ] shows the varying of @xmath95 with @xmath90 under two different photon numbers @xmath64 and @xmath99 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath95 is a lorentz line - shape , which determines the amplitude and width of the absorption signal of the monochromatic light by a two - level atom in laser spectroscopy .",
    "the resonance point of the light and the two - level atom is at @xmath100 , where @xmath95 has its maximum value @xmath101 .",
    "we can see such maximum value of @xmath95 is always less than @xmath102 due to that the @xmath103 limit of @xmath95 is just @xmath102 at @xmath100 .",
    "this means that the population of the excited state @xmath95 is always smaller than it of the ground state @xmath97 in a steady - state two - level atom .",
    "besides , @xmath64 and @xmath104 also determine the full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the absorption signal . in the condition @xmath105 ,",
    "the fwhm of the absorption signal is approximately @xmath68 , which means that the absorption signal of a weak - intensity light has the natural line - width @xmath68 of the excited state .",
    "when the light intensity ( proportional to @xmath106 ) increases , the fwhm of the absorption signal is broaden to the value @xmath107 , which is called power broadening in laser spectroscopy .",
    "such steady - state solution of @xmath95 is also proportional to the radiation force @xmath108 from the monochromatic light to the atom , which is very important in the laser cooling of atoms .",
    "another useful solution of eq .",
    "( [ obe ] ) is the evolution of @xmath109 before the system reaches its steady - state . from fig .",
    "[ evolution ] we can see such evolution of @xmath109 is also determined by the values of @xmath64 and @xmath104 . when @xmath110 , the @xmath109 reaches its steady value @xmath111 near @xmath112 , and has less than one oscillation period before it ; when @xmath113 , the @xmath109 reaches its steady value @xmath114 near @xmath115 , and has two rabi oscillation periods before it ; when @xmath116 , the @xmath109 reaches its steady value @xmath117 near @xmath118 , and has five obvious oscillation periods before it ; when @xmath119 , the @xmath109 reaches its steady value @xmath120 near @xmath121 , and has ten obvious rabi oscillation periods before it .",
    "the larger values of @xmath122 cause ( i ) larger steady - state values of @xmath123 , ( ii ) larger damping time of @xmath109 before reaching steady - state , ( iii ) and larger rabi oscillation frequencies as well as amplitudes of @xmath109 during the damping time .",
    "the value of @xmath104 is determined by the space - dependent wave - functions of the excited and ground states ( see eq .",
    "( [ int ] ) ) .",
    "when the rabi oscillation disappears , the system reaches its final steady - state , where the phase parameter , @xmath124 , disappears and the dephasing effect due to the spontaneous emission happens @xcite .",
    "therefore , the way to increase the rabi oscillation frequencies and amplitudes , as well as the damping time of @xmath109 is to increase the photon number @xmath64 , which is just to increase the intensity of the monochromatic light in practise .     between @xmath125 and @xmath126 under different values of @xmath127",
    "( with @xmath64 being the number photons which is proportional to the intensity of the light ) .",
    "@xmath85 is the lifetime of the excited state @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath100 . the dotted ( black ) line , dashed ( red ) line , dash dotted ( green ) line , and solid ( blue ) line are the evolution of @xmath109 with @xmath110 , @xmath113 , @xmath116 , and @xmath119 , respectively .",

    "however , our new obes can still reach the results of fig .",
    "[ absorption ] and fig .",
    "[ evolution ] without the eda .",
    "then our obes can be applied to describe the evolution of a two - level atom ( with transition frequency being in the x - ray range ) in a monochromatic in a x - ray laser beam .",
    "such two - level atom could have the absorption spectroscopy of x - ray laser that described by fig .",
    "[ absorption ] ) in the steady - state ( @xmath91 ) , and have the rabi oscillation that shown in fig .  [ evolution ] before the two - level system reaching its steady - state .",
    "another useful result in fig .",
    "[ evolution ] is the population inversion ( @xmath128 ) of the two - level system during the first period of rabi oscillations ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "since the rabi frequency and amplitude are proportional to @xmath130 , the time from @xmath125 to the maximum value of population inversion ( we define it as @xmath131 ) can be shorten by increasing the intensity of the monochromatic light , while the @xmath95 is also increased .",
    "then the value of @xmath131 can be obtained from the evolution of @xmath109 .",
    "this value is useful for the pulse pumped atomic x - ray laser system @xcite . for example , a three - level system with two ground states @xmath132 , and one excited state @xmath44 is prepared with all the papulation being at @xmath133 .",
    "we can pump the population from the @xmath133 to @xmath44 to make a population inversion between @xmath44 and @xmath134 , then the x - ray laser with the frequency between @xmath44 and @xmath134 can be made . in the case when the spontaneous emission rate from @xmath44 to @xmath133 , @xmath135 , is much larger than it from @xmath44 to @xmath134 , @xmath136 , the transition between @xmath44 to @xmath133 by a free - electron laser can be considered as a two - level system approximately , and can be described by the obes in eq .",
    "( [ obe ] ) . when the duration of an intense pulse from the free - electron laser is close to @xmath131 ,",
    "the population inversion between @xmath44 to @xmath133 happens ( green line in fig .",
    "[ evolution ] ) , which is the most effective population inversion between @xmath44 and @xmath134 . then from the obes in eq .",
    "( [ obe ] ) one can calculate out @xmath131 to optimize the duration of the pump pulse in order to give an efficient pump rate for the atomic x - ray laser .",
    "we consider a simple case that a two - level atom interacting with monochromatic light in this paper .",
    "our work can be extend to the case of a multi - level atom interacting with multi - frequency light , with which the non - linear effect of the light - atom interacting system can be studied .",
    "the quantization of multi - frequency electromagnetic field is @xmath137 where @xmath138 .",
