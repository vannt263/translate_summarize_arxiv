    "recently , several experimental papers have reported results on the collective modes of bose condensates in a one - dimensional optical lattice @xcite and its damping at finite temperature @xcite . in these experiments , a shift of the oscillation frequency in the presence of the optical lattice and a sharp change of the damping rate with increasing depth of the optical lattice have been observed . the measured frequency shift @xcite of the collective modes is in good agreement with the renormalized mass theory of krmer _ et al .",
