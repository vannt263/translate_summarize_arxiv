    "@xcite have shown how a cavity with a movable mirror ( treated as a quantum harmonic oscillator ) can be used to synthesize schrdinger cat states  @xcite of the cavity field .",
    "in fact , as we will see here , this system can lead to the production of an extensive class of novel states of the cavity field , including entangled states of two or more cavity modes .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to describe how these can be achieved .",
    "furthermore , in ref.@xcite only the effect of photon leakage from the cavity was considered as a relevant source of decoherence .",
    "we examine the opposite extreme , namely when the decoherence induced in the field due to the damping of the mirror s motion is the dominant source of decoherence and photon leakage is almost absent .",
    "we calculate the effect of this type of decoherence on the states of the cavity field and explicitly demonstrate that , due to the oscillatory nature of the system , the decoherence rate is much lower than expected .",
    "moreover , we show that apart from trying to improve the mirror s isolation , increasing its frequency also helps to reduce the rate of the type of decoherence considered here .",
    "this fact comes as a benefit in the generation of atleast one type of nonclassical state of the cavity field .",
    "these results definitely brighten the prospects of observing nonclassical states of the field inside the cavity given that damping of the mirror s motion is inevitable .",
    "it is also shown that even when the effect of mirror damping on the cavity field is dominant , it does not destroy all the nonclassical features of the cavity field .",
    "in ref.@xcite , the main focus was the generation of nonclassical states of the cavity field .",
    "we give here a thorough treatment of the quantum dynamics of the mirror as well .",
    "in particular , we point out ways in which this mirror motion can also be put in a nonclassical state .",
    "of course , if these are to be observed , then very good isolation of our system from the environment is necessary .",
    "however , the very fact that this system allows in principle the production of nonclassical states of a macroscopic object such as the mirror ( after sufficient isolation ) should be interesting in itself .",
    "numerous authors have previously treated the system of a cavity field and a movable mirror , both quantum mechanically  @xcite and classically  @xcite , and both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "we here assume the movable mirror to be a quantum harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath0 and annihilation operator denoted by @xmath1 , interacting with a cavity field mode of frequency @xmath2 and annihilation operator denoted by @xmath3 . the relevant hamiltonian  @xcite is @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the length of the cavity and mass of the movable mirror respectively .",
    "the time evolution operator corresponding to the above hamiltonian was evaluated by mancini _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ( for completeness we give a proof in appendix a ) and is given by    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    @xmath8         \\mbox{exp}\\left[i k^2 ( a ^\\dagger a)^2 ( t-\\sin{t})\\right ]         \\mbox{exp}\\left[k a^\\dagger a(\\eta b^\\dagger- \\eta^*b)\\right ]                 \\mbox{exp}\\left[-i b^\\dagger b t\\right ] ~,\\ ] ]    2 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the scaled coupling parameter , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 represents a scaled time , being the actual time multiplied by @xmath0 .",
    "we note that values for @xmath13 of the order of unity are experimentaly feasible ( @xmath14 )  @xcite .",
    "we see from the above equation that there is now an explicit kerr - like term in @xmath15 , so that physically one might expect the cavity field to have an evolution similar to that in a kerr like nonlinearity . in view of the large variety of nonclassical states that can be produced by a kerr medium  @xcite",
    ", this system clearly offers prospects for the production of nonclassical states of light  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is known that , like the kerr nonlinearity , this system of a moving - mirror cavity also exhibits optical bistability  @xcite .",
    "let us assume that initially both the mirror and the cavity field are in coherent states . to see that this is reasonable we first note that the long - time steady state of the cavity mode is the vacuum , and that the most stable pointer state  @xcite for the mirror ( being a single harmonic oscillator ) is a coherent state  @xcite .",
    "the steady state therefore consists of the cavity mode in the vacuum state and the mirror in a coherent state . the cavity mode can now be placed in a non - vacuum coherent state by driving it with a coherent input field on a time - scale which is much shorter than the time - scale of the mirror motion .",
    "thus we write the initial state at time @xmath16 as @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are initial coherent states of the field and the mirror respectively .    the time evolution of the system in the interaction picture ( that is , omitting the free evolution of the field ) leads to a state at time @xmath12 given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes a fock state of the cavity field with eigenvalue @xmath22 , and the @xmath23 are coherent states of the mirror given by @xmath24 two features of the mirror dynamics emerge from the above equations :    ( 1 )   after a time @xmath25 the mirror returns to its original state .",
    "at all times between @xmath16 and @xmath25 the mirror state is entangled with the field state with the entanglement being maximum when @xmath26 .",
    "the time dependence of the entanglement is shown in fig.(1 ) as a plot of the purity , or `` linear entropy ''  @xcite which is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the reduced density matrix of the mirror .",
    "( 2 )   the mirror , always being in a mixture of coherent states during its evolution , is described by entirely positive wigner functions and therefore has a fully classical dynamics as illustrated in fig.(2 ) . in this figure , and all the figures showing the wigner function of the mirror , @xmath29 shall stand for @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath32 .",
    "the mirror undergoes an oscillation of a different amplitude ( but at the same frequency ) for each number state of the field .",
    "the net effect is a kind of _ breathing _ of the mirror state ; the mirror state undergoes an oscillatory increase and decrease of its position and momentum spread .",
    "however , this is very different from the well known breathing of squeezed states , as the mirror state is a mixture of coherent states .",
    "[ setup2 ]    thus , during undamped evolution , no nonclassical state of the mirror is generated .",
    "however , because of the entanglement of the mirror with the field , it is possible to generate nonclassical states of the mirror by performing conditional measurements on the field .",
    "we discuss this in section  [ mcon ] .",
    "we divide the discussion of the generation of nonclassical states of the cavity field into three categories : ( a ) multicomponent cats generated at @xmath25 due to dynamics alone ( i.e without any external intervention ) . among these ,",
    "a method of generating the 2-component schrdinger cat has been discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "( b ) entangled states of two or more light modes generated at @xmath25 due to the dynamics alone .",
    "( c ) nonclassical states produced due to conditional measurements on the mirror .",
    "of course the discussion here is by no means exhaustive and there remains the possibility of generating even more interesting states .      at time @xmath25 the state of the cavity field , as obtained from eq.(5 ) , is given by @xmath33 depending on the value of the parameter @xmath13 , the state @xmath34 can be made equivalent to a variety of multicomponent cats . for @xmath35 , @xmath36 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is a two - component schrdinger cat .",
    "for @xmath37 we get the three component cat , @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( not normalized ) . for @xmath41 , @xmath42 which is a four component cat ( not normalized ) .",
    "thus by adjusting the ratio of the coupling and the mirror frequency and thereby varying @xmath13 one can , in principle , obtain all these types of cats at time @xmath25 .",
    "the wigner functions of the cats produced by different values of @xmath13 are shown below in fig.(3 ) . in this figure and",
    "all figures showing the wigner function of the cavity field @xmath43 and @xmath44 are dimensionless quantities .",
    "exactly the same type of states have been noted before as arising in the kerr medium  @xcite .",
    "it is indeed worth noting that creating such states in a cavity such as ours has intrinsic advantages because there is an extensive set of tomographic methods  @xcite that can be implemented to reconstruct the wigner function in a cavity .",
    "two modes of light , each separately interacting with the movable mirror , and with no direct coupling between them , can end up being in an entangled state at time @xmath25 depending on the value of the parameter @xmath13 .",
    "let there be two different modes of light inside the cavity at @xmath16 . for simplicity",
    "we assume them to have the same frequency and hence same value of the parameter @xmath13 , but mutually orthogonal polarization directions .",
    "we assume them to be initially fully disentangled and prepared in coherent states .",
    "let the initial state of the composite system of the mirror and the light be @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are states of the first and second modes respectively , while @xmath19 is the initial state of the mirror .",
    "the state of the two light modes evolves at @xmath25 to the state ( not normalized ) @xmath48 the state can be rewritten as @xmath49 where @xmath50 as is evident from the above equation , @xmath51 are states of the same type as the state @xmath52 given by eq.(7 ) with an amplitude @xmath53 .",
    "hence , for certain values of @xmath13 ( such as 0.5 or @xmath54 or @xmath55 ) , number states of one mode become correlated with multicomponent cat states of the other mode . however",
    ", if @xmath13 is such that @xmath56 is an integer for all @xmath22 and @xmath7 , then the state @xmath51 becomes independent of @xmath7 and @xmath57 becomes a disentangled state . some simplification of eq.(14 )",
    "for k=0.5 results in the entangled state @xmath58 note that production of entangled states in a kerr medium , when the two modes of light have a direct interaction between them have been discussed before  @xcite ; however this case is different in the sense that the modes become entangled because they both individually interact with the same movable mirror .",
    "+ there is no restriction on the number of modes that can be entangled using the above procedure ( only each mode to be entangled has to be resonant with the cavity ) .",
    "it is interesting to demonstrate how eigenstates of the operator @xmath59 where @xmath60 are annihilation operators of @xmath61 different modes of light and @xmath62 is an integer can be created in the cavity . as it is possible for resonant modes to have frequencies that are integer multiples of each other ,",
    "let us consider the case when there are @xmath61 different modes of light in the cavity , with their frequencies @xmath63 being related by @xmath64 where @xmath65 are integers . then from eq.([gpar ] ) it follows that the value of their @xmath66 parameters will be related by @xmath67 .",
    "hence if the initial state of the cavity modes and the mirror is @xmath68 the final ( at time @xmath69 ) composite state of the cavity modes will be    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    @xmath70 as the term @xmath71 can not be split up into a product of the form @xmath72 , for arbitrary values of @xmath73 , @xmath74 can , in general , be an entangled state depending on the value of @xmath73 .",
    "now consider the case when @xmath75 .",
    "we have @xmath76 redefining @xmath77 in the above equation as @xmath78 , recasting the equation in terms of the new @xmath77 and using the fact that @xmath65 are integers , one gets @xmath79 hence @xmath74 are eigenstates of the operator @xmath59 , generalizations of the well known even and odd coherent states which are eigenstates of squares of annihilation operators  @xcite .    2      because of the entanglement of the mirror state with the state of the cavity field during evolution , any measurement on the mirror will project the cavity field to some state which we can determine .",
    "we consider here measurements of the mirror s position , @xmath80 ( i.e , @xmath29 represents actual position of the mirror multiplied by @xmath81 , @xmath7 being the mass of the mirror ) , at time @xmath26 , as the entanglement is most pronounced at that time .",
    "such a measurement will project the state of the light to latexmath:[\\[\\label{fsup }    |\\eta(x)\\rangle_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize c } } = n\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{\\alpha^n}{\\sqrt{n!}}e^{i \\pi k^2 n^2 } \\langle x|\\phi_n ( \\pi)\\rangle    mirror position @xmath29 , different states of the cavity field are produced .",
    "let us choose parameters @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "then the peak of the gaussian function @xmath85 lies at @xmath86 and its width is @xmath87 .",
    "thus the distance between the peaks of @xmath85 and @xmath88 , that is , @xmath89 , is greater than the width @xmath90.hence , if the value obtained for @xmath29 obtained as a result of the measurement is near @xmath91 , the most dominant constituent of the state @xmath92 is @xmath21 . in this way",
    ", we may expect to produce nonclassical states which are very close to number states .",
    "for example , if the value obtained for @xmath29 is near 0 ( which is near @xmath93 ) the cavity field is projected to the state ( unnormalized ) @xmath94 which is shown in fig.(4a ) .",
    "similarly when @xmath29 is near @xmath95 , we get a state very close to the number state @xmath96 as shown in fig.(4b ) .",
    "when @xmath29 is inbetween @xmath91 and @xmath97 we get essentially a superposition of states @xmath98 and @xmath99 as illustrated in fig.(4c ) for @xmath100 ( the state in the figure is approximately @xmath101 , not normalized ) .",
    "fock state superpositions and their nonclassical properties have been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "it is evident from the above discussion that the generation of the above type of states solely rely on the narrowness of the coherent state width in comparison to the spatial separation between the peaks of the gaussians @xmath85 and @xmath88 . as this spatial separation",
    "can always be increased by increasing the value of the parameter @xmath13 , the proximity of the states produced to fock states and their superpositions can always be improved .",
    "we note that the first two types of states , that is , the cats and the entangled states , rely on the kerr type term in the time evolution and hence they can be generated in a kerr medium as well .",
    "in particular , generation of cat states in a kerr medium was suggested some time ago  @xcite .",
    "however , the generation of the third type of states ( i.e the number states and their superpositions ) do not appear to have an analogue in the kerr medium because they are entirely dependent on the entanglement of the states of the mirror and the cavity field during evolution .",
    "the system also offers the opportunity to create quite different nonclassical states of the mirror by conditional measurements on the @xmath29 quadrature of the light field . as",
    "the spatial separation between the coherent state components of the mirror is maximum at @xmath102 , measurements at this instant are likely to produce the most nonclassical states of the mirror .",
    "a measurement of the @xmath29 quadrature of the light field at this instant of time projects the mirror state to @xmath103 as the @xmath104 are coherent states with a different amplitude for each value of @xmath22 , @xmath105 is a _ superposition of spatially separated coherent states _ and as such an entirely nonclassical state of the mirror .",
    "moreover , as the parameter @xmath13 is increased , the separation between the coherent components @xmath106 increases .",
    "so by varying @xmath66 , one can control the macroscopic distinguishability of the states involved in the superposition . in fig.(5 ) we have plotted the wigner function for the state of the mirror produced when @xmath107 and the measurement result is @xmath108 .",
    "this state is distinctly nonclassical and looks somewhat like a schrdinger cat state with unequal amounts of each coherent component .",
    "the importance of the above procedure stems from the observation that there is already a considerable amount of literature , both theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite , focussed on methods to prepare atoms in nonclassical motional states .",
    "so it is only natural to expect that placing a more massive object in such states should be an issue of serious consideration .",
    "the ability to place macroscopic objects in non - classical states may even posses applications .",
    "hollenhorst , for example , has shown that placing gravitational wave detectors in squeezed states leads to higher sensitivity  @xcite .",
    "allthough schemes relying on momentum transer to a massive object from several microscopic objects ( such as atoms or neutrons ) have been suggested  @xcite , these are definitely difficult to implement experimentally . thus the scheme described in this section offers a possible direction from which the production of nonclassical states of a macroscopic object may be approached .",
    "obviously , these states will decohere very rapidly , and their realization may enable some tests of decoherence models  @xcite .",
    "the three main issues which will need to be addressed to bring this scheme to a practical level are : ( 1 ) how well isolated the movable mirror can be made , ( 2 ) how to perform tomography of the states produced and ( 3 ) how to perform instantaneous measurements of the @xmath29 quadrature of the field inside the cavity .",
    "we leave the treatment of these issues for the future .",
    "@xcite , the decoherence of the cavity field was treated as entirely due to the leaking of light through the cavity mirrors . here",
    ", we investigate the complementary case i.e. when the photon leakage from the cavity is almost absent , but damping of the mirror s motion is significant .",
    "it is somewhat artificial to assume no leakage of light from the cavity , but _ in principle _ the rate of mirror damping can be made a few orders of magnitude more than the rate of damping due to the leakage of light by choosing mirrors of sufficiently high reflectivity .",
    "we do not try to address issues of practical feasibility in this paper , however .    as the state of the cavity field",
    "is entangled with the state of the mirror at times between @xmath109 and @xmath110 , it is expected that the decoherence of the mirror will induce a decoherence of the cavity field .",
    "however , its effect on the state of the cavity field is expected to be _",
    "nontrivial_. during the standard decoherence due to leaking of light from the cavity , the coherent states of light form the relevant pointer basis  @xcite .",
    "however , in the case considered here , coherent states of the mirror are in one to one correspondence with number states of the cavity field .",
    "so if decoherence of the mirror forces it towards a coherent state basis , it will induce a decoherence of the cavity field towards the number state basis .",
    "this decoherence will leave some imprint on the state produced in the cavity at time @xmath25 .",
    "the equation which governs the decoherence of the mirror depends on the way the mirror is coupled to its environment . here , for simplicity , we assume that the mirror is amplitude coupled to the environment at zero temperature , which implies the master equation  @xcite @xmath111 + \\frac{\\gamma}{2 } ( 2 b \\rho ( t ) b^\\dagger -   b^\\dagger b   \\rho ( t ) - \\rho ( t ) b^\\dagger b)\\ ] ] where @xmath112 is the hamiltonian of eq.([g ] ) . since we are using a scaled time @xmath12 , @xmath113 in the above equation",
    "is the usual damping constant ( that is , the reciprocal of the dissipation timescale ) divided by the mirror frequency @xmath0 .",
    "eq.([master ] ) has the feature that it singles out coherent states as the pointer basis  @xcite .",
    "it is expected that natural decoherence of macroscopic objects should force them towards a coherent state basis ( to conform with classical reality ) , and eq.([master ] ) accomplishes exactly this .",
    "so we expect that the solution of eq.[master ] will atleast give the basic features of the effect of mirror decoherence on the cavity states correctly .",
    "a similar justification has been given for the use of the above type of decoherence in modelling quantum measurement in ref.@xcite .",
    "a more appropriate model for the decoherence of the mirror is quantum brownian motion  @xcite , but it is also more difficult to solve for our system of interest .",
    "work is in progress to solve the quantum brownian motion for our system numerically , while here we present the analytic solution for the evolution of our system when decoherence is described according to eq.([master ] ) .",
    "this solution is expected to have most features ( at least the localization of the cavity field towards a number state basis ) similar to the solution in the case of quantum brownian motion because both drive the mirror state to a mixture of coherent states .",
    "the technique we use to solve eq.([master ] ) is to apply the unitary evolution and the nonunitary ( decohering ) evolution alternately for short instants of time @xmath114 , and then take the limit as @xmath115 . for simplicity , we assume the initial coherent state of the mirror to be the vacuum state .",
    "the solution for this initial condition is evaluated in appendix b , and the result is    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    @xmath116 where @xmath117 are the amplitudes of the coherent states of the mirror and @xmath118 .\\ ] ]    2 the term @xmath119 in eq.([compl1 ] ) is responsible for decoherence.note that as @xmath120 , we have @xmath121 and @xmath122 where @xmath123 is that given by eq.([phi1 ] ) , with @xmath124 set equal to zero . in other words , the solution given by eq.([compl1 ] ) reduces to the undamped solution given by eq.([ro1 ] ) .",
    "the fact that the mirror is in a mixed state and does not return to a pure state at @xmath25 as in the undamped case is illustrated in fig.(6 ) in a plot of the linear entropy of the mirror s state versus time .",
    "the wigner function for the light field at @xmath25 for various values of our scaled damping constant @xmath113 and @xmath35 ( that is , when a schrdinger cat is expected in the absence of any decoherence ) is given in fig.(7 ) .",
    "two features concerning the type of decoherence considered here become clear from these figures :    \\(1 ) note that from fig.7(a ) , it is evident that even for a value of scaled @xmath113 as high as 0.001 ( that is , unscaled @xmath113 of 1 ) , we have almost no decoherence of the schrdinger cat at all . thus ,",
    "unless the mirror is quite heavily damped it has almost no effect on the states produced inside the cavity .",
    "a possible cause for this is that the efficiency of decoherence depends on the separation between the coherent states of the mirror corresponding to different number states of the field .",
    "this separation is not constant , but oscillates between zero and a maximum value of @xmath125 .",
    "the decoherence process , does not , therefore , get the chance to act with as much efficiency as it would have if the mirror was not a harmonic oscillator . speaking more mathematically , eq.([compl3 ] )",
    "implies that @xmath126 is proportional to @xmath127 and not just @xmath128 . as increasing the frequency decreases @xmath13",
    ", it also decreases the rate of decoherence even if @xmath113 ( which relates to the isolation of the system ) is held constant . in terms of the absolute time",
    "@xmath129 ( obtained by dividing the scaled time @xmath12 , which we had been using , by @xmath0 ) , the time scale @xmath130 of decoherence depends on the frequency as ( from eqs.([gpar ] ) , ( [ compl3 ] ) and definition of @xmath13 ) @xmath131 thus controlling @xmath132 offers an alternate way to control the decoherence timescale of our system .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that an analogous situation has been pointed out in ref.@xcite in the context of the jaynes cummings model , where atomic spontaneous emmission has a much weaker effect on revivals of atomic inversion than the cavity field damping . in that case , however , the explanation was quite different , namely , that spontaneous emmission is independent of the cavity field intensity , while cavity damping is intensity dependent",
    ". this logic will also apply to our system when the intensity of the cavity field is large .",
    "the term which causes decoherence , @xmath133 , is completely independent of the intensity of the cavity field .",
    "so as this intensity increases , the photon damping begins to dominate over the mirror s motional damping , as far as influencing the final state in the cavity is concerned .",
    "\\(2 ) the interference peak of the schrdinger cat , which is a primary feature of this cat , is not significantly lowered by the decoherence process ( see figs.7(b)-7(d ) ) , allthough there is a phase diffusion of the state .",
    "the reasoning for this is the simple fact that the decoherence is towards the number state basis , which preserves the photon number distribution .",
    "the photon number distribution at @xmath25 is same for both the decohered state given by eq.([compl1 ] ) and the undecohered state given by eq.([ro1 ] ) .",
    "this means that one of the primary signatures of the schrdinger cat , namely , an oscillating photon number distribution ( that is , the probability of odd photon numbers being zero for an even coherent state and vice versa ) is the same for the final state produced at @xmath25 , irrespective of whether there was decoherence or not .",
    "so the decoherence considered here is not acting to eliminate all nonclassical properties of the field that would be produced without decoherence .",
    "it does destroy the phase information , but maintains the nonclassicality of the number distribution .",
    "this is precisely the reason why the interference peak of the schrdinger cat does not appear to be destroyed even when scaled @xmath113 is as high as unity , as depicted in fig.7(d ) .",
    "so far we have only considered how the generation of the schrdinger cat is affected in the presence of the mirror s motional damping .",
    "let us now briefly pause to consider how the generation of the other nonclassical states of the cavity field may be affected .",
    "the entangled states of two or more cavity modes mentioned in section.[enta ] are generated by a procedure identical to the generation of the multicomponent cats and hence should have similar patterns of decoherence . on the other hand ,",
    "the fock states mentioned in section.[fock ] will not atall be affected by the type of decoherence considered here , as it drives the cavity field towards a mixture of fock states . moreover , even after their production they will be very stable because , neither the hamiltonian evolution , nor the decohering evolution destroys a fock state of the cavity field .",
    "ofcourse one will have to remember that in a realistic case the photon leakage will also be present , which does destroy fock states @xcite .",
    "lastly , comes the superpositions of two successive fock states , also described in section.[fock ] .",
    "these will , ofcourse , be seriously affected as the decoherence process will be destroying the coherence between successive fock states . as the generation of the nonclassical states of the mirror depend crucially on the coherence between the different @xmath134 components of the system s state , it will also be affected .",
    "in fact , at the very instant of generation of a nonclassical state of the mirror of the type given by eq.([mir ] ) , the coherence between any two of its components like @xmath106 and @xmath135 , will be @xmath136 of the undamped value .",
    "we have already mentioned that the decoherence timescale of the system may be increased by increasing the frequency of the mirror . but whether that actually helps in the generation of any of the nonclassical states described in this paper requires further scrutiny .",
    "for example , the multicomponent cats are generated only when @xmath137 reaches a certain value .",
    "but @xmath126 depends precisely on @xmath137 and not simply on time . thus increasing the frequency",
    "will ofcourse increase the decoherence timescale , but also increase the timescale for the production of the cat states proportionately , so that they are decohered by the same amount whenever they are produced .",
    "for the nonclassical states of the mirror described by eq.([mir ] ) , the situation is somewhat better , but not without its problems . by decreasing @xmath138 ( through @xmath139 ) , one",
    "not only decreases the rate of decoherence but also decreases the spatial separation between the coherent state components involved in the superposition .",
    "hence the components in the superposition may become more coherent , but they also become less _ macroscopically distinguishable _ .",
    "however , in the generation of the superposition of two successive fock states , decreasing @xmath139 really does help .",
    "the reason is clear from eq.([fsup ] ) .",
    "the components of the superposition are fock states of the cavity field and thereby do not depend in any way on the parameter @xmath13 .",
    "the only contribution of @xmath66 comes in the amplitudes , and two successive fock states can always be made to have significant amplitudes whenever the measurement outcome @xmath140 is about halfway between the peaks of the gaussians @xmath85 and @xmath88 , irrespective of the value of k. thus there is atleast one type of nonclassical state whose generation can be aided by increasing the mirror frequency .",
    "in conclusion we would like to stress that the work presented here offers new prospects for the observation of nonclassical features of light in the cavity . even when the decoherence due to the mirror s motion is maximum , the nonclassicality associated with the photon number distribution in the cavity is preserved .",
    "however , nonclassicality associated with the phase distribution is hindered .",
    "but here also , one can be optimistic from the viewpoint that the effect is not dominant unless the mirror is very heavily damped .",
    "we have not addressed the problem of detecting the states produced in the cavity because there exists an extensive literature on this topic  @xcite .",
    "the primary aim of further work must be to solve the system when the mirror is damped according to quantum brownian motion models  @xcite so that one can set up explicit limits on the parameters such as the temperature and mass of the mirror required to observe the nonclassical states in the cavity in their most undecohered condition .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that the feature of decoherence of the field towards the number state basis should also be present in that full solution , since any physically sensible decoherence model must tend to localize the mirror state towards the coherent state basis .",
    "in addition there are prospects to utilize the system for tests of quantum brownian motion , which can be explored further .",
    "also , we have considered starting initially with only a coherent state inside the cavity . one might be able to produce more interesting nonclassical states by starting with nonclassical states .",
    "in fact , all that can be investigated in the kerr medium can be done with this system .",
    "even more can be done with the mirror system perhaps becuase of the opportunities of conditional measurements .",
    "this work was supported in part by the uk engineering and physical sciences research council , the european union , the british council , the inlaks foundation and the new zealand vice chancellor s committee .",
    "one of us ( plk ) would like to acknowledge discussions with p.meystre and s.stenholm on rubber cavities over many years .    2",
    "the time evolution operator is given by @xmath141 where @xmath12 is the time multiplied by @xmath0 , @xmath10 and @xmath142 .",
    "we now consider a unitary transformation using the operator @xmath143 note that this is a displacement operator for the mirror in which the displacement amplitude has been replaced by the number operator for the cavity mode .",
    "using the baker - cambell - hausdorf expansion  @xcite , the effect of this transformation is readily shown to be @xmath144 using the fact that @xmath145 for any function @xmath146 , unitary operator @xmath147 , and arbitrary set of operators @xmath148 , the effect of the transformation on the time evolution operator is easily calculated to be @xmath149 multiplying on the left by @xmath150 , and on the right by @xmath151 , we obtain the following expression for the time evolution operator : @xmath152 ( note that to obtain this expression we have swapped various exponentials which contain commuting arguments . ) to obtain the final form of @xmath15 , we need to swap the last two exponential factors in this expression . to acheive this we note first that the bch expansion gives @xmath153 e^{ib^\\dagger b } = a^\\dagger a ( b^\\dagger e^{-it } - be^{it } ) , \\ ] ] and again using eq.([oprel ] ) we obtain @xmath154 multiplying both sides on the right by @xmath155 we arive at the relation required to swap the exponentials , namely @xmath156 we may now write the expression for @xmath15 as @xmath157 and to obtain the final expression given in eq.([ev ] ) , we need only combine the arguments of the @xmath158 and @xmath159 exponentials , which is readily acheived with the bch relation  @xcite .",
    "we need to solve eq.([master ] ) , which contains two parts .",
    "the solution of the first part @xmath160   ~,\\ ] ] is known to be @xmath161 where , @xmath15 is given by eq.([ev ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the second part , @xmath162 is known to transform @xmath163 as  @xcite @xmath164 where , @xmath165 and @xmath166 are coherent states .",
    "let the initial state of our system be @xmath167 that is , we assume the mirror to be in a vacuum state initially ( for simplicity ) .",
    "as the damping localizes the mirror state to a coherent state basis , and corresponding to each number state of the field , the mirror is driven to a separate coherent state , at any time @xmath12 the general form of the density matrix will be @xmath168 thus , we can split the evolution of the entire system into separate evolutions labelled by @xmath7 and @xmath22 . in other words , we break our problem into that of calculating the evolution of each of the entities @xmath169 separately . in any small time step @xmath114",
    "during which evolution occurs only according to eq.([unit ] ) , the amplitudes of the coherent states of the mirror change according to @xmath170 while if evolution occurs according to eq.([nonunit ] ) , then @xmath171 hence we can set up the following differential equation @xmath172 the solution for which ( with initial condition @xmath173 ) is given by @xmath174 next let us determine how @xmath175 evolves .",
    "following eq.([unit ] ) it evolves as @xmath176 while eq.([nonunit ] ) transforms @xmath177 where the smallness of @xmath114 and the fact that @xmath178 ( from eq.([gphi ] ) ) have been used .",
    "hence , evolving @xmath179 according to eq.([u ] ) and eq.([nu ] ) alternately and taking the limit @xmath115 we obtain @xmath180 combining eq.([gphi ] ) , eq.([ro ] ) and eq.([break ] ) , and evaluating the integral in eq.([ro ] ) one can obtain eqs.([compl1])-([compl3 ] ) of section  [ damp ] , which constitutes the complete solution for the density matrix of the system at an arbitrary time .",
