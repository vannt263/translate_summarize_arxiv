    "cyclical variability of the sun , first discovered through analyses of the sunspot number @xcite , affects the interplanetary / planetary magnetic fields and environment in a number of ways . during solar maximum , increases in flares and coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) lead to an increase in the injection , acceleration , and transport of solar energetic particles .",
    "earth - directed solar particle events last from a few minutes to weeks , occurring from a few times a year to once a month .",
    "they can damage satellite electronics and even pose health risks to astronauts and aviators @xcite .",
    "associated geomagnetic effects from enhanced solar activity disrupt ionospheric communications and can result in high - magnitude geomagnetically induced currents , causing power outages like the march 1989 quebec blackout [ details are available in the north american electric reliability council report at http://www.nerc.com/files/1989-quebec-disturbance.pdf . ] . during solar minimum",
    ", the total heliospheric magnetic flux weakens allowing for an enhancement in the levels of galactic cosmic rays ( gcrs ) , relativistic particles of energies from 100mev through 10gev that are mainly produced in powerful supernova explosions from stellar nurseries throughout the galaxy .",
    "prolonged solar minima , like the recently observed extended minimum between sc 23 and 24 , lead to high level radiation dose rates in interplanetary space that are a serious health hazard for astronauts during extended space travel ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .    in this article , we present an analysis of the x - ray and cme properties spanning several solar cycles . in the x - rays ,",
    "the _ geostationary operational environmental satellites _ ( goes ) spacecraft provide continuous soft x - ray monitoring data for nearly 40 years .",
    "we utilize these data to relate changes in the non - flare solar x - ray background to the sunspot number for sc 2224 in section  [ s - background ] . in section  [ s - flares ] , we expand upon earlier research into variation of x - ray flare rates with solar activity ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) by characterizing flare rates as a function of sunspot number .",
    "in section  [ s - cme ] we compare _ large angle and spectrometric coronagraph _",
    "( lasco ) measurements related to cme speed and width to sunspot number for sc 23 and 24 .",
    "we also compare the cme and x - ray flare properties over these cycles .",
    "the results of our analysis include updated flare and cme frequencies that include sc 24 activity . with the newly updated sunspot number index ,",
    "these new rates can be compared to historical rates to place current solar activity in the context of the historical record .",
    "we discuss this further in section  [ s - conclusion ] .",
    "the solar soft x - ray background flux , produced in the corona from free  free bremsstrahlung and line emission from flare plasma in active region magnetic loops , varies cyclically ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) . in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we utilized the publicly available 18  x - ray observations from goes from 19862014 to establish that this background flux can be used to predict the date of solar cycle maximum , the maximum x - ray background at maximum and throughout the cycle , and the date of the next solar minimum from a few years into the solar cycle .",
    "the background is measured as the minimum 18  flux in the preceding 24 hours for each one - minute xrs measurement , following the procedure of @xcite .",
    "this technique excludes strong flares and instead measures the quiescent flux from active regions .    extending upon our previous soft x - ray background study",
    ", we compare the 18  background flux described by @xcite with the revised sunspot number @xcite .",
    "we included analyses of the goes 18  data from january 1986 through february 2016 .",
    "the revised sunspot number series was obtained for this same period from the wdc - silso , royal observatory of belgium , brussels obtained from http://www.sidc.be/silso/datafiles .",
    "figure  [ fig - xraybackground ] shows the comparison of the revised sunspot number ( the daily total sunspot number , binned to a one - week interval ) to the x - ray background ( binned to a one - week interval ) .",
    "both parameters characterize the solar activity level throughout the cycles by tracking changes in the active regions ( _ e.g. _ , through relative x - ray brightness or number of sunspots ) .        .",
    "the slopes from each of the solar cycles are consistent within the errorbars , with differences in this relationship tied to the normalization factor . ]    in figure  [ fig - ssnxraybackground ] , we show the direct correlation between x - ray background flux and sunspot number for sc 2224 . for each solar cycle , we perform a linear regression fit of the form : @xmath1b = slope @xmath1ssn + intercept . both the background and ssn",
    "are binned by one week , with the same dates used for the binning time periods .",
    "the best - fit values and associated correlation coefficients are included in table  [ table - ssnfits ] .",
    "we also computed spearman rank correlation coefficients for the direct relationship ( non - logarithmic ) between these values , resulting in @xmath2 of 0.79 ( sc 22 ) , 0.65 ( sc 23 ) , and 0.59 ( sc 24 ) . in both cases , there is a significant correlation between x - ray background and ssn .",
    "both the slope and the intercept values change between the solar cycles , although we note that these changes are not statistically significant when accounting for the error bars .",
    "however , we find that the slope flattens and the intercept increases with decreasing solar cycle strength .",
    "this effect is best seen in figure  [ fig - ssnxraybackground ] at low sunspot number ( @xmath3 ) , where the average x - ray background is higher in the weaker solar cycles ( i.e. , sc 24 ) in the stronger solar cycles . since the background is below the goes detection limit during the extremely weak minimum between sc 23 and 24 , we tested whether this result holds for higher sunspot number where our sampling of x - ray background flux is complete .",
    "we find slopes of @xmath4 ( sc 22 ) , @xmath5 ( sc 23 ) , and @xmath6 ( sc 24 ) , with @xmath7 , where ssn @xmath8 .",
    "similarly , we find slopes of @xmath9 ( sc 22 ) , @xmath10 ( sc 23 ) , and @xmath11 ( sc 24 ) , with @xmath12 , where ssn @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the flatter slope in the relationship between ssn and x - ray background flux for lower activity levels is not an effect of poor measurements of x - ray flux at low ssn .",
    "a possible explanation for the differences in the relation between ssn and x - ray background between solar cycles is that the sun is further into the activity cycle when lower sunspot numbers are observed during a weaker cycle when compared to the earlier phase of a stronger solar cycle ( _ e.g. _ , ssn of 30 is reached closer in time to solar maximum in sc 24 than in either sc 22 or 23 ) .",
    "the overall magnetic activity may be higher in the weaker solar cycle , as indicated by a higher x - ray background flux , despite the ssn being the same as during the stronger solar cycle .",
    "a study of the size and morphology , as well as estimates of the total energetics , of the sunspots during similar ssn between weaker and stronger solar cycles might reveal further differences .    these relationships between ssn and x - ray background flux",
    "give us a means to estimate the x - ray flux during historical time periods where x - ray measurements were not taken .",
    "in turn , in the following section the x - ray activity level is compared to the x - ray flare rate , for which our x - ray background  ssn relationship allows a comparison of the expected rate for historical time periods .",
    "the x - ray background ",
    "ssn relationship can be used as a method of predicting the x - ray flare and cme rates using the ssn from earlier solar cycles where x - ray measurements are not available .",
    ".results from the comparison of the x - ray background flux to ssn [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     statistics for the solar cycle phases from rise to maximum for both sc 23 and 24 by ssn . the number of cmes on days within the indicated ssn range ( @xmath14 ) , as well as average and standard deviations of the linear speed and width .",
    "all cmes with widths below 55@xmath15 are excluded to result in a more uniform comparison ( i.e. , more narrow cmes are included in later versions of the cdaw lasco cme catalog ) .    in table",
    "[ table - cmestats ] , we present statistics on a comparison of the number , speed , and width of cmes from sc 23 and 24 .",
    "since sc 24 is not complete , we compare similar phases of the solar cycles from the rise from minimum to maximum . as in section  [ s - flares ] , the daily ssn matching each cme is used to find the statistics within a range of ssn . from our comparison of the two cycles ,",
    "we find that the filtering to normalize the cme catalog may need adjustment , since there are 1844 cmes recorded in sc 23 and 2609 in sc 24 . at lower ssn ( @xmath16 ) , there are significantly more cmes recorded in sc 24 .",
    "many of these additional cmes have slower speeds than the sc 23 cmes , though the average width tends to be the same or larger in sc 24 . as the ssn increases , there are significantly more cmes in sc 23 ( i.e. , from ssns of 150200 there are 2.4 times more cmes in sc 23 ) .",
    "the speed is also higher in sc 23 , but the average widths are consistent .",
    "when we compare the average speeds and widths from different ssn ranges , we find that speed increases with ssn , while average width is fairly consistent .",
    "one caveat on this analysis is that we compare cme properties with no lag between solar activity and cmes .",
    "@xcite , for instance , found that the peak in the cme rate lagged the peak in sunspot number by months .",
    "additionally , @xcite found that cme speed lags ssn by several months .",
    "we have not investigated the presence of a time lag between cme properties and ssn in the current analysis , but note that other studies do see such effects .",
    "we defer a more detailed analysis of time lag affects to future studies .    as an additional investigation ,",
    "which is not dependent on ssn , we compute the distribution of cme speed and width .",
    "we use the data from sc 23 , which spans a full solar cycle .",
    "figure  [ fig - cmedistributions ] presents the results .",
    "a power - law fit to the linear speed distribution yields : @xmath17^{-0.015 \\pm 0.005},\\ ] ] with correlation coefficient @xmath2 of 0.75 and p - value @xmath18 .",
    "this relation holds where ssn @xmath19 250 , since few measurements exist for the highest ssns .",
    "meanwhile , a power - law fit to the width distribution results in : @xmath20^{-0.035 \\pm 0.007},\\ ] ] with @xmath2 of 0.75 and p - value @xmath18 .        .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    finally , we compare the cme speed and width to x - ray peak flux for all cmes within one hour of the onset of an x - ray flare .",
    "figure  [ fig - xraycme ] shows the results for both solar cycles 23 and 24 .",
    "we find that the highest flux x - ray flares are also associated with faster and wider cmes .",
    "this is consistent with earlier results ( _ e.g. _ , sc 23 cme analysis by @xcite ) .",
    "we note that while a trend of increasing width and speed is found , there is no significant statistical relationship from a linear regression analysis ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "we have presented an analysis of revised sunspot number and have compared it to the fluctuation of the x - ray background . while the x - ray background during the last solar minimum was often below the goes detection limit , we show that a linear relationship exists between sunspot number and x - ray background flux .",
    "this relationship exhibits a slow steepening of the number spectrum moving from less active to more active solar cycles .",
    "we also present the power - law relationships between x - ray flare rates binned by sunspot number ranges , showing that the flare rates are somewhat similar irrespective of the ssn .",
    "a two - dimensional plot of the cme frequency shows that number counts of cmes and uniform selection criteria are important in distinguishing the changes in the number and properties of cmes from cycle to cycle . from a selected sample of cmes , using a position angle measure of width @xmath22 , we show that the number of cmes in sc 24 is consistent with the number of cmes during sc 23 at the same phase .",
    "this result agrees with an analysis of halo cmes from @xcite . additionally , we determine the power - law relationship between the projected cme speed and width as a function of sunspot number , showing that these parameters exhibit similar frequencies throughout a solar cycle .    in summary ,",
    "our results include the relationship between ssn and x - ray background flux , power - law relationships of flare occurrence rate as a function of ssn , cme number counts through sc 23 and 24 , and cme rates as a function of ssn . with the newly revised ssn dating back several hundred years ,",
    "our results allow for a comparison of the expected flare and cme properties during historical times where x - ray and cme observations are not available .",
    "our results also allow for a comparison of the x - ray background level where only ssn is estimated",
    ". this can provide insight for modeling of the solar conditions associated with extreme historical storms , like the 1859 carrington event .",
    "additionally , our results can be used to estimate cme and flare rates in solar - analogs , to estimate stellar activity levels from x - ray flux measurements and from this radiation effects on extra - solar planets .",
    "the authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest .",
