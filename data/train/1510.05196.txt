    "therefore the scaling limit of simple random walks on the euclidean grid is conformal invariant .    in 2000",
    "stas smirnov @xcite proved that the scaling limit of critical bernoulli site percolation on the triangular lattice is conformal invariant .",
    "poincar ( 1907 ) proved that every simply connected riemann surface is conformally equivalent to one of the following three surfaces : the open unit disk , the euclidean plane , or the riemann sphere .",
    "in particular it admits a riemannian metric of constant curvature .",
    "this classifies riemannian surfaces as elliptic ( the shpere ) , parabolic ( euclidean ) , and hyperbolic ( negatively curved ) .",

    "he and schramm @xcite proved a discrete uniformization theorem for triangulations : let @xmath0 be the @xmath1-skeleton of a triangulation of an open disk .",
    "if the random walk on @xmath0 is _ recurrent _ , then @xmath0 is circled packed in the euclidean plane .",
    "conversely , if the degrees of the vertices in @xmath0 are bounded and the random walk on @xmath0 is _ transient _ , then @xmath0 is circle packed in the unit disc .    for an extended version of the brooks , smith , stone and tutte ( 1940 ) square tiling theorem , a related discrete uniformization theorem for graphs using squares ,",

    "a graph is transient if simple random on the graph returns to the origin finitely many times almost surely and otherwise is called recurrent .",

    "[ c1 ] assume @xmath0 is transient , then @xmath3-bernoulli site percolation on @xmath0 admits an infinite cluster a.s .",
    "we do nt know it even for any fixed @xmath4 .",
    "the motivation for the conjecture is outlined below and is based on conformal invariance of percolation . after more than two decades of thorough research , conformal invariance of critical bernoulli percolation was established essentially only for the triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "one reason to be slightly skeptical about the conjecture is that for critical percolation on the triangular lattice , the probability the cluster of the origin reaches distance @xmath5 decays polynomially in @xmath5 @xcite , while there are transient triangulations of volume growth @xmath6 .",

    "we do nt have a proof of the conjecture even when the squares are colored black with probability @xmath9 .    behind",
    "the second conjecture is a coarse version of conformal invariance .",
    "that is , the crossing probability is balanced if the tiles are of uniformly bounded distance to circles ( rotation invariance ) , and the squares can be of different sizes , ( dilation invariance ) .",
    "let @xmath0 the @xmath1-skeleton of bounded degree transient a triangulation of an open disk .",

    "_ does recurrence implies no percolation at 1/2 ? _    by same reasoning we will see unboundely many macroscopic clusters for @xmath3-bernoulli percolation , suggesting that if @xmath0 is a @xmath1-skeleton of bounded degree transient a triangulation of an open disk , then there are a.s .",

    "we further believe that @xmath14 for polynomial growth triangulations of the open disk .",
    "note that if all degrees are at least @xmath15 , polynomial growth implies that vertices of higher degrees are polynomially sparse , this suggests that their critical probability for percolation is @xmath3 , as of the triangular lattice . for nonamenable transitive or sofic triangulations @xmath16 @xcite ,",
    "remove the transitivity assumption .    since we believe that @xmath17 for such @xmath0 s , by planar duality we conjecture that @xmath18 and _ uniqueness monotonicity _ holds as well .",

    "there is no scale invariance for the poisson process on the hyperbolic plane and increasing @xmath25 corresponds to the curvature approaching @xmath26 .",

    "it is reasonable to conjecture that the ( annealed ) crossing probabilities converge as @xmath25 increases to infinity .",
    "in particular they converge along a subsequence .",

    "the limit is euclidean and should be given by cardy s formula @xcite .",
    "the argument above gives the conformal invariance of a subsequential limit .",
    "the point is that conformal invariance of the subsequential limit follows from the hyperbolicity .",

    "together with oded schramm we conjectured that changing the uniform measure in the disc ( the measure used in sampling the poisson points ) in a uniformly absolutely continuous way , should not effect crossing probability , as the intensity grows and showed that conformal change of the metric do not effect crossing probabilities . here",
    "we observe that when placing an infinite measure and unbounded metric , so that as the intensity grows the local tiling geometry also converges to that of the high intensity euclidean , conformality follows via hyperbolicity ."
