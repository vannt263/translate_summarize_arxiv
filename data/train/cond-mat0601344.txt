    "knowledge about the spatial structure of systems is a subject that attracts more and more interest in statistical physics . for example",
    ", the study of morphological features has proved very useful to identify and distinguish various formation processes in contexts as varied as the study of large scale distributions of galaxies , or the investigation of micro - emulsions @xcite .",
    "other examples of situations where the focus on the spatial structure is of primary importance to understand the physical properties of a given system are provided by dissipative structures in hydrodynamics , turing patterns occurring in chemical reactions , or transport properties of fluids @xcite .",
    "for instance , the transport of a fluid over a porous substrate depends crucially on the existence of a connected cluster of pores that spans through the whole system @xcite . gaining insight into the spatial structure of the most commonly used lattice - models in statistical physics -i.e .",
    "the potts , clock and generalized ising models- is also a matter of interest in the field of image - analysis , which makes extensive use of these models to simulate noise and clean dirty images @xcite . in this context ,",
    "mathematical quantities that characterize the typical spatial structure of the model seem to be the most natural tuning parameters as opposed to the usual thermodynamic quantities .",
    "+ consequently , efforts have recently been made @xcite to study the typical behavior of minkowsky - functionals ( or curvature integrals ) which quantify the geometrical properties of a given system .",
    "particular interest has been devoted to the study of the euler - poincar characteristic which turns out to be a relevant quantity in various models : let us indeed recall , that for the problem of bond percolation on regular lattices , sykes and essam @xcite were able to show , using standard planarity arguments , that for the case of self - dual lattices ( e.g. @xmath3 ) , the mean value of the euler - poincar characteristic changes sign at the critical point , see also @xcite . + more recently blanchard , _ et al .",
    "_ showed @xcite using duality and perturbative arguments , that for the two dimensional random cluster model ( the fortuin - kasteleyn representation of the q - state potts model ) the mean local euler - poincar characteristic is either zero or exhibits a jump at the self - dual temperature .",
    "more precisely , it vanishes when @xmath4 and exhibits a jump of order @xmath5 when @xmath6 is large enough .",
    "similar results were shown in higher dimensions @xmath7 .",
    "+ this paper aims to investigate the spatial structure of the ising model with arbitrary spins on @xmath3 which , unlike the potts - model , does not have a color - symmetry .",
    "we introduce colored complexes ( i.e. the sets of sites for a given configuration that belong to the same color ) and study the behavior of the associated local mean euler - poincar characteristics . as a result of our numerical computations",
    ", we obtain that the mean value of the euler characteristic per site vanishes below the critical temperature and is positive above this temperature .",
    "as we shall see , this behaviour can be related to the behaviours of topological invariants , the betti s numbers .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the model and give the definitions of the principal quantities of interest .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the results obtained by intensive monte - carlo simulations .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section @xmath8 .",
    "to introduce the generalized ising model considered by griffiths in @xcite , we associate to each lattice site @xmath9 a spin @xmath10 in the set @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( with cardinality @xmath13 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian in a finite box @xmath14 is given by : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a positive constant that we will take equal to @xmath17 in the next section , and the sum runs over nearest neighbors pairs of @xmath18 .",
    "the associated partition function is defined by : @xmath19 where the sum is over all configurations @xmath20 and we let @xmath21 denote the ( corresponding expectation ) of a measurable function @xmath22 . among the quantity of interest",
    ", we shall first consider the magnetization @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the number of sites of @xmath18 .",
    "let us recall that this system exhibits a spontaneous magnetization at all inverse temperatures greater than the critical temperature of the ising model ( @xmath25 ) , as proved in @xcite .",
    "we next introduce others quantities , namely the mean euler characteristic per site . consider a configuration @xmath26 , and let @xmath27 be the set of bonds ( unit segments ) with endpoints @xmath28 , such that @xmath29 , and @xmath30 be the set of plaquettes @xmath31 with corner @xmath32 , such that @xmath33 . to a given configuration @xmath26 , we associate ( in a unique way ) the two  dimensional cell",
    " subcomplex @xmath34 of the complex @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the set of bonds with both endpoints in @xmath18 and @xmath37 is the set of plaquettes with corners in @xmath18 .",
    "the euler characteristic of this subcomplex is defined by : @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes hereafter the cardinality of the set @xmath40 .",
    "it satisfies the euler ",
    "poincar formula @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are respectively the _ number of connected components _ and the _ number of independent @xmath17-cycles _ of the subcomplex @xmath44 . here @xmath45 because @xmath44 has no @xmath46-cycles .",
    "notice that @xmath47 where the local euler characteristic @xmath48 is given by : @xmath49 here , @xmath50 is the set of nearest neighbours of @xmath51 , the second sums is over plaquettes containing @xmath51 as a corner , and @xmath52 is the kronecker symbol : @xmath53 if @xmath29 , and @xmath54 otherwise .",
    "we define the mean euler characteristic per site and the mean betti s numbers per site by : @xmath55    the following limits exist and coincide : @xmath56 here the first limit is taken in such a way that the number of sites of the boundary of @xmath18 divided by the number of sites of @xmath18 tends to @xmath57 , while there is no restriction in the second limit .",
    "the existence of these limits are simple consequences of griffith s inequality @xcite which states that : @xmath58 this implies the following monotonicity properties with respect to the volume : @xmath59 these properties give the existence of the infinite volume limit @xmath60 through sequences of increasing volumes .",
    "they imply also , following @xcite , that the limiting state is translation invariant .",
    "it is then sufficient to observe that : @xmath61}{\\prod_{b \\in s_q , b \\neq 0 } b}\\ ] ] and thus can be written as a ( finite ) linear combination @xmath62 with finite coefficients @xmath63 to conclude the existence of the second limit in ( [ lim ] ) , since also by ( [ qlocal ] ) the local euler characteristic is a ( finite ) linear combination of the @xmath64 with finite coefficients .",
    "the translation invariance allows finally to show that this second limit in ( [ lim ] ) coincides with the first one under the above mentioned conditions .",
    "we shall also consider the subcomplexes of @xmath44 attached to each color .",
    "namely , for a given configuration @xmath26 and a given color @xmath65 , we let @xmath66 be the subset of the box @xmath18 such that @xmath67 , @xmath68 be the subset of bonds of @xmath27 with endpoints @xmath69 such that @xmath70 , and @xmath71 be the subset of plaquettes of @xmath72 with corner @xmath73 , such that @xmath74 . for each color @xmath1 , we associate to a given configuration @xmath26 , the two  dimensional cell ",
    "subcomplex @xmath75 .",
    "obviously @xmath76 is a subcomplex of @xmath77 and hence a subcomplex of @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the euler characteristics of these subcomplexes are defined by : @xmath80 they satisfy the euler  poincar formula @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are respectively the number of connected components and the maximal number of independent @xmath17-cycles of the subcomplex @xmath84 . here",
    "again @xmath85 because @xmath76 has no @xmath46-cycles .",
    "note that @xmath86 as for the total euler characteristic , the euler characteristic of each color can be written as a sum over local variables : @xmath87 where @xmath88    we define the mean euler characteristic per site and the mean betti s numbers per site of the colored subcomplexes : @xmath89    one can show that the following limit exist and coincide : @xmath90 by using the relation @xmath91 and arguing as before .",
    "we have performed intensive monte carlo simulations to study the thermodynamic behaviour of this model . as expected , we find that it belongs to the 2d - ising universality class for all tested values of @xmath92 with the same critical exponents .",
    "the inverse critical temperature @xmath93 at which second order phase transition occurs for @xmath92 ranging from 2 upward tends to 0 with increasing values of @xmath92 .    using binder cumulants @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) , we find @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "the critical exponent for the magnetization is found equal to @xmath97 one for the susceptibility to @xmath98 .    figs .",
    "1 and 2 show the finite size scaling plots of the magnetization and the susceptibility for @xmath99 and @xmath100 for different system sizes @xmath101 : @xmath102 .     and @xmath100 .",
    "@xmath103 as function of @xmath104 .",
    "@xmath105 is the reduced inverse temperature . ]",
    "^2 \\times l^{-7/4}$ ] as function of @xmath104 , for @xmath99 and @xmath100 for different system sizes . ]    in the following we present computed mean values of the euler characteristic and related betti s numbers per site and per color for several values of @xmath92 as function of the inverse temperature @xmath106 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions have been used which obviously lead to a symmetry between colors @xmath1 and@xmath107 .",
    "the equilibrium configuration presents a preference for positively or negatively oriented spins .",
    "we have chosen in the statistics , the first one , i.e. the one corresponding to @xmath108 boundary conditions .",
    "figure [ plotglobal ] shows the behaviour of the mean values of the global euler characteristic @xmath109 and betti s numbers @xmath110 and @xmath111 as function of @xmath106 for @xmath112 and @xmath113 is nothing but the number of connected components of the complex and @xmath114 is the number of independent cycles , i.e. the number of @xmath115dimensional holes in the complex .",
    "seemingly , @xmath116 appears as a decreasing function of @xmath106 and vanishes for @xmath117 .",
    "the decrease of @xmath116 for @xmath118 is associated both to a decrease of @xmath119 and an increase of @xmath114 .",
    "in addition one observes that for @xmath117 these two quantities decrease and seem to compensate each other . this would explain the vanishing of @xmath116 for @xmath120 . as we shall see this compensation",
    "can be understood intuitively by looking at the behaviour of the colored euler - poincar characteristic @xmath121 and colored betti s numbers @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath112 .",
    "let us look at the ising case @xmath25 for which these quantities are presented in figure  [ q1 ] .",
    "we observe that for @xmath118 the quantities @xmath125 , @xmath122 , @xmath126 do not depend on colors @xmath127 .",
    "however they exhibit a sharp transition in the color variable right at the critical point .",
    "it is also seen that above @xmath117 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "therefore @xmath130 which implies that in this range of temperature the global euler characteristic vanishes .",
    "alternatively the behaviour of the colored betti s numbers explain why @xmath131 which , in view of formula ( [ chi - additivity ] ) , gives also that the global euler characteristic vanishes .",
    "these facts can be understood intuitively at low temperatures if one has in mind the usual picture of islands of @xmath132 inside a sea of @xmath133 .",
    "indeed , for such configurations , say @xmath26 , one has @xmath134 and each island gives a contribution @xmath17 to both @xmath135 and @xmath136 .    on the other hand , when @xmath118 there exists only one ( disordered ) phase with independent colors .",
    "this corroborates the fact that @xmath125 , @xmath122 and @xmath126 do not rely on colors in this domain of temperature .",
    "in addition , the disorder increases when beta decreases , and in this domain of temperature it is natural to expect that the number of connected components of each color increases , while the number of independent cycles ( of each color ) decreases .",
    "figure [ q2 ] shows the results for the case @xmath99 ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "considering first the colors @xmath138 , one can formulate the same reasoning as for the case @xmath25 .",
    "the quantities of interest behave similarly as before except for the amplitudes .",
    "the color @xmath139 does not present any particular feature .",
    "@xmath140 translates the fact that this color is dominated by the two extremal states @xmath141 for all values of @xmath106 .",
    "this is reflected by noting that @xmath142 in figure [ q2 ] .",
    "in figure [ q5 ] we present our results for the case @xmath100 ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "we observe that for @xmath117 the main contribution to the number of connected components comes from color @xmath144 .",
    "figure [ zoompi1 ] below gives an enlargement of figure [ q5 ] showing the behavior of the other colors .",
    "here also a sharp transition is observed at the critical point .",
    "all numerics have been performed with careful thermalization control ( up to @xmath145 mc steps before measurements ) .",
    "data simulation errors were controlled through binning analysis . in all figures ,",
    "the error bars are smaller than the sizes of the symbols .",
    "the hoshen - kopelman cluster search algorithm @xcite for colored connected components identification has been used .",
    "in @xcite we have already shown that for the random cluster model , the mean value of the euler - poincar characteristic with respect to the fortuin - kasteleyn measure exhibits a non trivial behaviour at the critical point .",
    "namely , there we found that , in dimension @xmath46 , it is either zero or discontinuous at the transition point .    here , for the ising model with arbitrary spins on @xmath0 ,",
    "our numerics show that the topology of configurations reveals the signature of the phase transition . in particular",
