    "integral_. if these sources are included , well over 100 igr sources have been foundrodrigue / html / igrsources.html ] .",
    "all or nearly all of the igr sources have been found in the 2050 kev band with the imager on board the _ integral _ satellite ( ibis ) coded aperture mask instrument @xcite . large numbers of igr sources have been found because of the combination of hard x - ray imaging with @xmath6 angular resolution , a large field of view ( @xmath7 by @xmath7 fully coded fov for ibis ) , and the _ integral _ observing plan , which emphasizes observations of the galactic plane .",
    "follow - up observations of the igr sources have shown a diversity of source types , including low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , active galactic nuclei , cataclysmic variables as well as other source types . while some of the sources have proved to be transient ,",
    "others have been consistently detected in x - rays in multiple _ integral _ observations as well as by other current and previous x - ray instruments , suggesting that they are persistent .",
    "one sub - group of igr sources exhibits persistent but highly variable x - ray emission .",
    "these sources lie within a few degrees of the galactic plane and show some evidence for clustering near galactic spiral arms @xcite .",
    "their x - ray fluxes are typically @xmath8110 millicrab in the hard x - ray band @xcite , and their luminosities are mostly unknown due to large uncertainties on their distances , but they may have luminosities of @xmath9 ergs  s@xmath10 if they are at typical 110 kpc galactic distances .    although x - ray , optical , and infrared ( ir ) observations of this group of persistent , galactic igr sources show that they do not have uniform properties , some trends have been identified . for many of these sources , their x - ray spectra show high column densities with values of @xmath11 well in excess of the levels expected due to interstellar material .",
    "the most extreme example is igr j163184848 , for which @xmath12 @xmath2 @xcite , and there are also several other sources with values of @xmath11 in the @xmath13 @xmath2 range ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "many of the galactic igr sources also exhibit x - ray pulsations , indicating the presence of a neutron star .",

    "igr j163184848 harbors an unusual supergiant b[e ] star , and the ir spectra also show p cygni profiles , suggesting the presence of a strong stellar outflow @xcite .",
    "another example is igr j173913021 (= xte j1739302 ) , which also contains a supergiant @xcite .    here",

    "although none of the sources have been previously well - studied , it has been pointed out that igr j161954945 is probably the _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics ( asca ) _ source ax j1619294945 @xcite",
    ". the 210 kev _ asca _ spectrum of this source is well - described by a very hard power - law with a photon index of @xmath16 and a relatively high column density of @xmath17 @xmath2 . based on its x - ray properties",

    "the nature of these 3 sources is completely uncertain @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we use observations with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ @xcite to obtain sub - arcsecond x - ray positions for the 4 sources (  @xmath18 ) and to determine whether the sources are associated with known sources (  @xmath19 ) . in  @xmath20 and  @xmath21 , we present a study of the _ chandra _ and _ integral _ spectra . in ",

    "we chose targets located close to the galactic plane that were detected in the 2040  kev band during our 2003 february _ integral _ observation of the black hole transient 4u 163047 @xcite and that were also reported in the first and second catalogs of _ integral _ sources @xcite .",
    "consistent hard x - ray detections gave us reason to believe that these were persistent sources and that the probability of detection with _ chandra _",
    "was high .",
    "table  [ tab : obs ] shows the observation ids ( obsids ) and times of our _ chandra _ observations of the 4 igr sources , which took place between 2005 april and july .",

    "although the effective exposure times are lower in the gaps between acis - i chips , we used a dithering pattern with an amplitude twice as large as the standard pattern to achieve a more uniform sensitivity over the _",

    "for further processing , we used the _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) version 3.3.0.1 software and calibration data base ( caldb ) version 3.2.1 .",
    "we used the ciao routine acis_process_events to obtain a `` level 2 '' event list and image .",

    "based on the image size of 854-by-854 pixels and our detection threshold of @xmath29 ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the brightest sources for these four obsids have 183 , 678 , 866 , and 676 counts , respectively , while the remaining sources have between 3 and 24 counts .",
    "in addition , each of these four brightest sources are located within the respective _ integral _ error circles ( see figure  [ fig : images ] ) , making it very likely that these sources are , in fact , the soft x - ray counterparts of the igr sources . in the following ,",

    "thus , the @xmath31 error circle can be considered to be slightly larger than a 90% confidence error circle .",

    "we produced 0.310 kev energy spectra for each of the four bright _ chandra _ sources using the ciao tool dmextract to produce the spectrum and the tools mkacisrmf and mkarf to produce the files needed to characterizing the instrument response .",
    "we used a circular source extraction region with a radius of @xmath39 and an annular background region centered on the source with inner and outer radii of @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "given that two of the sources are close to the gaps between the acis chips , we produced exposure maps to determine the effective exposure time for each source .",
    "the sources igr j162075129 and igr j171954100 ( obsids 5472 and 5474 ) received the full exposure time , but igr j161954945 ( obsid 5471 ) and igr j16167 - 4957 ( obsid 5473 ) received 70% and 67% of the full exposure time , respectively .",
    "the ciao tool mkarf automatically accounts for the reduced instrument response near chip boundaries .",
    "we fitted the spectra using the software package xspec 11.3.2o .",
    "originally , we rebinned the spectra and fitted them using @xmath42-minimization .",
    "after rebinning , the spectrum for the lowest count rate source ( igr j161954945 ) had 9 bins with an average of 20 counts per bin , while we used 12-bin spectra for the other 3 sources .",
    "we fitted the spectra using a model consisting of an absorbed power - law , and , based on the results for other igr sources , it would not be surprising if the column density has intrinsic and interstellar contributions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the absorbed power - law fit is acceptable ( @xmath43 ) for igr j161954945 , but we obtained very poor fits for the other three sources with values of @xmath42 between 46 and 83 for 9 degrees of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "large positive residuals above @xmath86  kev are the main reason for the poor fits .",
    "this suggests that photon pile - up @xcite is affecting these three spectra , and , indeed , one expects pile - up to significantly impact the spectral shape for sources with count rates as high as we observe for the three brighter sources ( 0.130.18 s@xmath10 ) .",
    "we refitted the three affected spectra after including the xspec pileup model @xcite , and the quality of the fits improves enormously with @xmath42 values of 3.7 , 8.7 , and 9.2 ( 8 dof ) for igr j162075129 , igr j161674957 , and igr j171954100 , respectively .",
    "comptonization models ( e.g. , comptt in xspec ) approximate a power - law shape in the 0.310 kev band and provide fits of similar quality to the power - law fits .",
    "while a thermal blackbody model can adequately describe the spectrum of the fainter source , such a model provides very poor fits to the spectra of the three brighter sources .",
    "even if the pile - up correction is included , an absorbed blackbody model gives @xmath42 values between 32 and 98 for 8 dof .",
    "we conclude that these three spectra are non - thermal , and we focus on the power - law model below .     and",

    "we studied the radial profiles of the 4 igr sources as a check of the pile - up correction , and we conclude that the psf distortions are well - explained by pile - up only and that the pile - up corrections we apply in performing the spectral fits are correct .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra ] shows the 0.310 kev spectra and residuals for the absorbed power - law fits ( with the pile - up correction ) , and table  [ tab : spectra ] provides the values of the spectral parameters . to obtain these values , we refitted the spectra by minimizing the cash  c \"-",
    "statistic @xcite , which is an improvement over @xmath42-minimization for spectra with small numbers of counts as the cash analysis does not require discarding information by rebinning the spectra .",
    "while none of the sources show the extremely high column densities that have been seen for some of the igr sources , the measured values of @xmath11 for igr j161954945 and igr j162075129 are @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xmath2 ( 90% confidence errors ) , placing them somewhat above their respective galactic column densities of @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "igr j161674957 and igr j171954100 have values of @xmath11 that are significantly lower than their galactic column densities .",
    "all the sources are intrinsically hard in the 0.310 kev band based on the measured values of the power - law photon index .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : spectra ] , the best fit values of @xmath44 range from 0.5 to 1.1 , and , in all cases , the spectra are constrained so that @xmath50 based on the 90% confidence ( @xmath45@xmath51 ) error bars . while the errors on the individual parameters indicate very hard spectra , we also calculated error contours to account for possible correlations between @xmath11 and @xmath44 .",
    "the contour plots in figure  [ fig : contour ] show the 68% ( @xmath45@xmath52 ) and 90% ( @xmath45@xmath53 ) confidence error contours , and it is clear that these parameters are significantly correlated for all 4 spectra .",
    "while this analysis shows that the error regions are somewhat larger than indicated by the individual parameter values given in table  [ tab : spectra ] , the spectra are still constrained to be quite hard , with @xmath54 ( 90% confidence ) , and it is still the case that igr j161954945 and igr j162075129 have column densities that are higher than the galactic values while @xmath11 is significantly less than the galactic values for the other two sources .    , scaledwidth=50.0% ]",

    "the light curves for igr j161954945 and igr j161674957 are strongly affected by the dithering over gaps between the acis chips . in both cases",
    ", the count rates drop to zero several times during the observation . in all , about 30% of the time bins are affected , and we do not study the light curves for these 2 sources further . on the other hand , there are no problems with the light curves for igr j162075129 and igr j171954100 , and these are shown in figure  [ fig : lightcurves ] . the clearest variability is seen for igr j162075129 . in the middle of the observation ,",
    "the count rate drops to about a third of its average level , remains there for @xmath8500  s , and then recovers .",
    "we formally tested for variability by fitting each light curve with a constant and obtained @xmath55 and @xmath56 for igr j162075129 and igr j171954100 , respectively .",
    "thus , it is likely that both sources exhibit some variability .",
    "we also produced @xmath522 kev spectra from the ibis / isgri instrument on _ integral_. the observations used to produce the spectra include all public data available from _ integral _ revolutions 46 to 235 ( 2003 february 27 to 2004 september 15 ) .",
    "we made sky images and mosaics with the off - line - analysis software version 5.1 in 10 energy bands between 22 kev and 250 kev , and we derived average source spectra from the mosaic images .",
    "after making vignetting , off - axis , and dead - time corrections , the effective exposure time is 495  ks for igr j171954100 and @xmath8165  ks per source for the other 3 sources ( see table  [ tab : integral ] ) . despite the relatively long exposure times , these sources are rather faint for _ integral _ with 2050  kev isgri count rates between @xmath57 and @xmath58  s@xmath10 ( compared to , e.g. , a 2060  kev count rate of 160 s@xmath10 for the crab pulsar and nebula ) .",
    "thus , the spectra of the igr sources consist of a relatively small number of energy bins . for igr j161954945 , igr j162075129 , and igr j171954100 ,",
    "we are able to obtain 4 energy bins in which the source is detected at a significance of at least 4-@xmath59 , and , for igr j161674957 , the source is only detected in 2 energy bins .",
    "we fitted the isgri spectra with a power - law model , and the results of these fits are given in table  [ tab : integral ] .",
    "for igr j161954945 , igr j162075129 , and igr j171954100 , acceptable fits are obtained with the power - law model with values of @xmath44 equal to @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , respectively . while , for igr j161954945 , the 90% confidence error region for @xmath44 overlaps with the error region determined using the _ chandra _ spectrum , the spectra for igr j162075129 and igr j171954100 are significantly steeper in the 2050 kev band than in the 0.310 kev _ chandra _ band .",
    "although the spectrum for igr j161674947 only has 2 energy bins , it is still possible to calculate the value for @xmath44 , and we obtain @xmath63 , which is significantly steeper than the _",
    "chandra _ measurement .",
    "the fact that the spectra are steeper in the isgri 2050 kev band when compared to the _ chandra _ 0.310 kev band suggests that there is a high energy cut off . to investigate the cut off and to compare the flux levels measured by the two instruments , we performed combined fits for the _ chandra _ plus isgri spectra .",
    "as there is evidence that these sources are variable , and the _ chandra _ and isgri spectra were not taken simultaneously , it is essential to leave the overall normalization between the two instruments as a free parameter .",
    "leaving all parameters free , we fitted the spectrum for each source with and without an exponential cut off ( highecut in xspec ) .",
    "the cut off is detected at the highest level of significance for igr j162075129 with an improvement in the fit from @xmath64 to 5.3/9 , corresponding to an f - test significance of 99.7% .",
    "the cut off is also marginally statistically significant for igr j161674957 , with a 98.4% chance that the cut off is required .",
    "the spectra for igr j161954945 and igr j171954100 allow for the possibility that there is a cut off in the isgri energy range , but the cut off is not required .    while we allowed the @xmath11 , the power - law parameters , @xmath65 in the pile - up model ( for the three brighter sources ) , the cut off parameters ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) , and the overall normalization between the two instruments to be free for the fits described in the previous paragraph , with so many free parameters ,",
    "the parameter values are very poorly constrained .",
    "thus , we fixed the @xmath11 , power - law , and pile - up parameters to the values measured by _",
    "chandra _ , and left just the normalization between instruments and the exponential folding energy ( @xmath67 ) as free parameters in the fit .",
    "we fixed the energy at which the exponential cut off begins ( @xmath66 ) to 10 kev , just above the _ chandra _ bandpass .",
    "however , it should be noted that , while the _ chandra _ spectra do not show any evidence for a spectral cut off , the quality of the spectra and the distortion of the spectra due to pile - up do not allow us to rule out the possibility that the cut off starts at a lower energy . for igr j161954945 , igr j162075129 , igr j161674957 , and igr j171954100 , respectively , we obtained isgri relative normalizations of @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 as well as the following values for @xmath67 : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 kev ( 90% confidence errors ) .",
    "these values indicate that igr j162075129 was relatively bright during the _ chandra _ observation compared to the brightness detected by isgri in 20032004 , while the other sources were consistent with a relative normalization of 1.0 .",
    "also , it is notable that the range of values we measure for @xmath67 , 932 kev , are similar to the values that have been measured for hmxb pulsars @xcite .",
    "with the @xmath32 _ chandra _ positions for the 4 igr sources , we are able to search for counterparts to these sources at other wavelengths . we searched the following catalogs : united states naval observatory ( usno - b1.0 and usno - a2.0 ) ; deep near infrared survey of the southern sky ( denis ) ; 2 micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) ; and _ spitzer _ s galactic legacy infrared mid - plane survey extraordinaire ( glimpse ) .",

    "<S> source is seen in the _ integral _ error circle , and these are likely to be the soft x - ray counterparts of the igr sources . </S>",
    "<S> they have hard 0.310 kev spectra with power - law photon indices of @xmath01.1 . </S>",
    "<S> while many previously studied igr sources show high column densities ( @xmath1 @xmath2 ) , only igr j161954945 has a column density that could be as high as @xmath3 @xmath2 . using optical and ir sky survey catalogs and our own photometry , </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained identifications for all 4 sources . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4-band magnitudes are in the range 14.910.4 , and we have used the optical / ir spectral energy distributions ( seds ) to constrain the nature of the sources . </S>",
    "<S> blackbody components with temperature lower limits of @xmath59400 k for igr j161954945 and @xmath518,000 k for igr j162075129 indicate that these are very likely high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , for igr j161674957 and igr j171954100 , low extinction and the seds indicate later spectral types for the putative companions , indicating that these are not hmxbs . </S>"
