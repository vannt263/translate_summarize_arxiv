    "the universe had a hot early state ",
    "most commonly thought to be a result of post - inflationary reheating . as the universe cooled , over many orders of magnitude , phase transitions likely occurred at many different scales @xcite .",
    "there were at least two associated with the standard model , the quantum - chromodynamic ( qcd ) and electro - weak phase transitions , but there may have also been others at higher energy scales .",
    "the possibility of observing gravitational radiation from these phase transitions is exciting . in the standard model ,",
    "the electroweak phase transition is second - order @xcite as the higgs field smoothly transitions from its high - temperature symmetric state to its low - temperature vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "however , only minimal modifications to the higgs potential from new physics beyond the standard model @xcite can force this transition to be first - order . in this case",
    "a tunneling process moves the higgs field to the vacuum state in the potential at which time the higgs acquires a vev .",
    "bubbles form , collide , and coalesce , greatly increasing the possibility of an observable cosmological phase transition by means of searching for the gravitational wave background .",
    "simulations of vacuum bubbles at different scales confirm that we understand the evolution of these bubbles in many different models . in the vast majority of these simulations , the field that undergoes",
    "the phase transition is uncoupled to other degrees of freedom and the velocities of the walls of the bubbles quickly approach the speed of light .",
    "early simulations reduced the number of dimensions of the problem @xcite capturing the physics of the direct collisions of two bubbles .",
    "the potentials that govern these fields have been growing more complicated , the number of dimensions in the simulations have grown , and much has been learned about the rich dynamics systems of bubbles colliding @xcite .",
    "these advancements have allowed authors to couple the fundamental degree of freedom to other scalar fields , and have shown how energy can be exchanged between the two .",
    "the challenge at the electro - weak scale is greater .",
    "fermions and gauge - bosons coupled to the higgs field do not have a semi - classical interpretation and can not be simulated alongside the higgs field on a classical lattice .",
    "more importantly , the dynamics of the coupled fields are not of the same scale as the dynamics of the higgs field . during the electro - weak phase transition it is more appropriate to think of the standard model fields as a coupled , relativistic fluid .",
    "there has been recent work in this area .",
    "a new study of a toy model in 1 + 1-dimensions @xcite has started to probe this question , studying the numerical evolution of dimensionally - reduced bubbles in the presence of a fluid .",
    "a subset of these authors , joined by others , have followed up with a a 3 + 1-dimensional simulation for a specific set of parameters that yields a first - guess at the gravitational radiation produced by the field during this process @xcite , although this work does not directly closely examine the dynamics of the bubbles themselves in the coupled field / fluid system .",
    "we believe that explicit investigation of the numerical system is necessary first .",
    "therefore before we direct our attention to the the generation of gravitational radiation , we have to fully understand the evolution of bubbles in such a system . here",
    "we will parameterize the phase transition with a scalar field subject to a canonical kinetic term , @xmath0 where , for now , we do not specify a coupling between the field and fluid . in order to broadly talk about first - order phase transitions of different strengths , we parameterize the potential @xmath1 as in @xcite using @xmath2 this choice of potential gives us flexibility , as it allows for comparisons between the standard thin - wall parameterization of first - order phase transitions , e.g. @xcite , as well as models in which the temperature dependence of the potential is explicitly included @xcite .",

    "we are used to seeing an almost - degenerate potential parameterized by @xmath18 where one can translate between the two with@xmath19    computationally , case i is the most difficult , as the bubbles produced in this model have thin walls ( as discussed in more detail below ) and require higher resolution in order to evolve .    since we will evolve our bubbles on a fixed , non - expanding grid ,",
    "the vacuum energy of the true vacuum does not enter into our equations of motion , and thus we choose not to specify it .",
    "the overall energy density of the simulation would be important if we included gravitational effects or if we tied the simulation to present - day observables ; we leave these two extensions to future work . here",
    "we are more interested in the generic behavior of phase transitions and therefore do not constrain our simulations to a particular energy scale .",

    "since lower @xmath12 simulations require much lower resolution , we would have the capacity to evolve bubbles for @xmath110 for much longer while still trusting the simulations .",

    "here we calculate the velocity of the bubble walls in the presence of a coupled fluid compared to the velocity of the bubble with @xmath101 .",
    "as we increase the strength of the coupling , our bubbles have a ( fairly constant ) late - time velocity that is significantly different from the uncoupled case .",
    "for some values of the coupling the velocity can be as low as @xmath111 , which significantly breaks the @xmath103 symmetry of the evolving bubble .",
    "we should note that these simulations are run for @xmath112 , the regime in which the energy density of the universe is dominated by the fluid .",
    "the values of the coupling strength @xmath74 are scaled logarithmically over a range of values chosen to illustrate the range of system behaviors .",
    "when we move toward @xmath113 , we are less able to trust our temperature - independent assumptions ; however , the software we present is capable of resolving dynamics in these regimes , so long as we retain a temperature - independent assumption .",
    "we have presented a set of robust high - resolution numerical simulations of phase transitions in which the order - parameter that defines the phase transition is coupled to a dynamical , relativistic fluid .",
    "we show that these simulations accurately track the behavior of the fluid and the field for a wide range of first - order phase transitions between @xmath13 and @xmath92 , the thin - wall limit .",
    "we have also shown that the velocities of the domain walls of these bubbles depend on the strength of the coupling between the fluid and field .",
    "we show that even modest couplings cause the bubbles to slow down ; breaking the @xmath103 symmetry associated with vacuum bubbles .",
    "we consider this work a first - step toward simulating the full dynamics of a first - order phase transition in the presence of a relativistic fluid , building on the numerical work already present in the literature and only the second such simulation to have been computed .",
    "since we trust the field and fluid evolution , we can use our code to simulate the generation of gravitational radiation in these models .",
    "the software presented here can be easily ` sewn in ' to the software we used in @xcite . in the cases",
    "where @xmath114 we expect to be able to simulate many bubbles in a relatively large volume",

    "another open question probes the nature the coupling between the field and fluid .",
    "the choice that we have made here represents a phenomenologically sound dissipative interaction , however it would be good to know whether new understandings of relativistic fluid actions @xcite can provide a theoretically motivated interaction term .",
    "further it would be necessary to tie the effective parameters of this model , @xmath74 and the equation - of - state , @xmath115 , to the parameters of the relevant fundamental particle physics .",
