    "in addition to the case of multi  photon emissions in the cavity output field , there are also cases where multiple photons simultaneously exit the cavity mirror _ and _ exit the side of the cavity .",
    "hence , the two  photon coincidence rate includes contributions from multiple photons emitted from the cavity as well as two photons emitted by the cavity and at least one photon leaving the side of the cavity .      in order to treat multiphoton emissions , the correlation function  @xmath72 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : w2 ] ) , must be generalized to the multiphoton case  @xmath73 , for @xmath74 the number of photons emitted .",
    "these photoemissions take place at random times @xmath75 with  @xmath76 a vector consisting of the photoemission times .",
    "only @xmath77 photoemission times are required for  @xmath78 photoemissions , as each photoemission time is determined with respect to the time of the first photoemission which can be fixed at @xmath79 .",

    "the rationale for the peak structure is readily extended to explain the similar peak structure observed for the other rate . without loss of generality , we choose , in this section , to study in detail the peak structure for the 3pcr  @xmath114 .",
    "this analysis of the 3pcr structure is important in subsection  [ subsec : difftwoph ] , as the 3pcr is responsible for perturbative corrections to the desired 2pcr , which provides the experimental signature of quantum field effects .",
    "in addition , the 3pcr structure could be used to identify further signatures of quantum field effects compared to the 2pcr signature alone .",
    "the isolation of specific transitions is obtained by the following procedure .",
    "for example , let us consider the influence on the 3pcr of the  @xmath116 transition .",
    "we can write the effective hamiltonian  ( [ eq : heff ] ) as a matrix in the dressed  state basis .",

    "[ app:3pcr:1](a ) . similarly fig .",
    "[ app:3pcr:1](b ) shows the graph for  @xmath122 and its conjugate set to zero .",
    "we observe that eliminating these two matrix elements causes a dramatic reduction of neighbouring peaks at both  @xmath123 , which is depicted as peak  @xmath124 , and  @xmath125 , which is depicted as peak  @xmath126 in fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] .",

    "the final contribution to the rate appears in fig .",
    "[ app:3pcr:3](b ) where the contribution of an  @xmath26 photon to the peaks is apparent . however , the transition  @xmath133 for the peak  @xmath131 is not resonant , but the transition is resonant for the peak at  @xmath132 . from the three figures  [ app:3pcr:1](a ) , [ app:3pcr:2](b ) and",
    "[ app:3pcr:3](b ) , we observe that the peak rate at  @xmath131 and  @xmath132 is overwhelmingly due to a sequence of an  @xmath22 photon followed by two  @xmath26 photon absorptions . by removing one of these three photons artificially , via setting the corresponding matrix elements of the liouvillean to zero , the peaks at  @xmath131 and  @xmath132 are dramatically decreased .",
    "the excitation pathway for the peak at  @xmath132 may be understood in a simple way as follows .",
    "once again setting  @xmath64 for the  @xmath134 transition reduces the peak , not only at  @xmath131 , but also for its close neighbour  @xmath132 .",
    "let us now consider the increase in peak  @xmath135 of fig .",
    "[ app:3pcr:1](a ) .",
    "this increase is due to a decrease in competition which arises by eliminating the  @xmath136 transition due to an  @xmath22 photon .",
    "this competition is clear from the following analysis . from fig .",
    "[ app:3pcr:1](d ) , we see that peak  @xmath135 is reduced by eliminating the  @xmath26 photon which drives the  @xmath137 transition .",

    "[ app:3pcr:2](b ) and [ app:3pcr:3](d ) as the  @xmath146 induced pathway  @xmath147 .",
    "thus , there are two contributing pathways , one via  @xmath148 and the other via  @xmath149 , which are both prevented by eliminating the  @xmath22 photon  induced  @xmath150 transition .",

    "[ app:3pcr:1](a ) is reduced for the condition that the  @xmath151 is suppressed .",
    "we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] that peak  @xmath152 is suppressed for peak  @xmath153 .",

    "some pairs are missed altogether because both photons escape detection .",
    "the other challenge concerns the detection of two simultaneously created photons .",

    "the choice of window time is not obvious , and it is our aim here to determine what the window time should be . as the two simultaneous photons can be separated by a time of order @xmath195 , as discussed above , the window time  @xmath58 might be expected to be on the order of @xmath195 . however , our purpose here is to consider the choice of @xmath58 in detail and to identify the optimal choice of window time  @xmath58 that will produce the strongest 2pcr .",
    "the choice of optimal window time is further complicated by the method of detecting nearly simultaneous photons . in the ideal case discussed above of a perfect photodetector yielding a record of all photon emissions from the cavity , one",

    "this determination is based on whether two photons arrive within a specified time interval . in the conditional case , two photons",
    "are treated as being members of the same ` simultaneously emitted ' pair if the second follows the first by less than the time window  @xmath58 ; in the unconditional case , they are considered to be members of a pair if the temporal separation of the photodetections is less than the time window  @xmath58 .",
    "both definitions are reasonable and depend on the nature of the detection scheme .",
    "the window time for the conditional difference2pcr will always be less than for the unconditional difference2pcr .",
    "the conditional process is more efficient , in a sense , because the detection interval is always triggered by the first photon , whereas the latter case allows part of an interval to pass even before the first photon is detected .",
    "thus , in the unconditional case , a longer interval is required to be able to detect the first photon and then subsequently wait for the second photodetection .",
    "we provide analytical solutions for the two extreme cases in  [ app : a ] .",
    "the window time can be extremely long @xmath202 , yielding expression ( [ long : time ] ) , or extremely short @xmath203 , yielding expression ( [ short : time ] ) for both conditional and unconditional 2pcr .",

    "let us characterise the quality of a 2pcr peak by the ratio of the peak height to the height of the background 2pcr .",
    "we can understand this figure of merit in terms of the ratio of signal to noise , where signal is the 2pcr from the desired two  photon decay events , and the background noise corresponds to two  photon decays arising from unwanted off - resonance two - quantum excitations and decay events .",

    "that is , either a larger or a smaller choice of the window time would reduce the value of the pvr , thereby making the peak more difficult to discern from background events .",
    "there are other concerns besides the pvr in choosing the window time .",
    "for example , choosing a much shorter window time could improve the pvr but also lengthen the run time of the experiment required to accumulate enough signal .",
    "in other words , the absolute height of the peak is also a matter of concern in determining the feasibility of the experiment and is determined by the allowable timescale of the experiment .",
    "the minimum height would need to be on the order of  @xmath214 for  @xmath215 the timescale of the data collection .",

    "[ fig : fig1 ] , whereas the pair signal rate does not decline as quickly for decreasing  @xmath1 .",
    "the increase in pvr is due to the fact that the resonant frequency for the transition @xmath23 is  @xmath218 , for a particular subensemble with coupling strength  @xmath1 , whereas the pump field frequency is constrained to satisfy  @xmath219 .",
    "hence , as  @xmath1 decreases , the pump field drives the system more and more off resonance .",
    "thus , the likelihood of driving the system from  @xmath220 to  @xmath158 , followed by a photoemission , then repeating the driving  @xmath23 and a second photoemission , decreases rapidly with diminishing  @xmath1 : hence the background 2pcr due to rapid driving to  @xmath158 from  @xmath220 is quite small . a lesser contribution to the 2pcr , due to  @xmath221 photons causing off ",
