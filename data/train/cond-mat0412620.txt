    "what survives of the luttinger liquid properties of a one - dimensional metal if two or more metallic chains are coupled by some weak interchain hopping @xmath9 ? motivated by the proposal that the anomalous normal state properties of the high - temperature superconductors are a manifestation of a two - dimensional non - fermi liquid state  @xcite , many authors tried to find an answer to the above question , using non - perturbative methods such as bosonization or the renormalization group ( rg ) @xcite . as a first step towards a solution of this rather difficult problem , it is instructive to study just two coupled spinless metallic chains  @xcite .    in spite of many years of research",
    ", one fundamental aspect has only recently been addressed @xcite : the _ self - consistent _ renormalization of the fermi surface ( fs ) .",
    "the band structure of two non - interacting metallic chains consists of a bonding and an antibonding band , leading in the generic case to a fs consisting of four points @xmath10 and @xmath11 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : band ] .",
    "if the density @xmath12 is held constant , then luttinger s theorem implies that the sum @xmath13 is not affected by interactions ; however , the difference @xmath2 , which is proportional to @xmath9 in the absence of interactions , can be strongly renormalized .",
    "the fs renormalization in two coupled metallic chains has been studied previously using rg methods in refs .",
    "however , the calculation of the fs in these works is either not self - consistent @xcite in the sense discussed in the classic book by nozires  @xcite , or the self - consistency has not been properly implemented within the framework of the rg  @xcite .",
    "the self - consistent definition of the fs is follows naturally from the fact that the shape of the fs is a characteristic property of a zero temperature rg fixed point  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that in our approach the concept of a flowing fs depending on the rg flow parameter  @xcite never appears : we construct the true fs as a rg fixed point , which by definition does not flow .    in this work",
    "we shall use our general method  @xcite of obtaining the fs as a rg fixed point to derive the self - consistency conditions for the true fermi momenta @xmath0 and @xmath1 of two coupled spinless chains . in the parameter regime where the coupled chain system is a stable luttinger liquid , these conditions can be cast into a simple transcendental equation for the distance @xmath2 between the fermi momenta , which for small @xmath9 and for weak interactions takes the form @xmath14^{-1 }   \\label{eq : deltares }   \\ ; .\\ ] ] here @xmath5 is the value of @xmath15 within the hartree - fock approximation , @xmath4 is the bare value of a suitably defined ( see below ) dimensionless coupling describing interchain backscattering , and @xmath16 is an ultraviolet cutoff .",

    "first of all , eq .  ( [ eq : deltares ] ) predicts a strong `` attraction '' between the two fermi momenta .",
    "it is tempting to extrapolate this result to an infinite array of coupled chains : then the fs forms a continuum consisting of two corrugated sheets .",
    "our two - chain result suggests that the curvature of the sheets should decrease due to interactions .",
    "this in turn enforces the nesting singularities and hence might stabilize a luttinger liquid state even in higher dimensions .",
    "the fact that interchain back - scattering reduces the value of @xmath15 has already been noticed by fabrizio @xcite .",
    "however , he neither studied this phenomenon quantitatively , nor did he try to calculate the true fs self - consistently .",
    "the renormalization of @xmath24 predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltares ] ) behaves rather different from the estimate based on perturbation theory around the exact solution of the isolated chains with only forward scattering @xcite .",
    "such an estimate leads to the prediction that the renormalized interchain hopping is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the anomalous dimension of the luttinger liquid and @xmath27 the fermi velocity for @xmath28 .",
    "the fact that without interactions @xmath29 suggests that in the interacting system @xmath30 $ ] for small @xmath26 . a comparison with eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltares ] ) shows that this is not a valid procedure to estimate the location of the true fs .",
    "in order to derive eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltares ] ) we need to keep track of the momentum- and frequency dependence of the four - point vertex . to do this we use here the functional rg method @xcite .",
    "we have derived eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltares ] ) using both the field theoretical  @xcite and the wilsonian formulation  @xcite of the functional rg . in order to make contact with previous work  @xcite ,",
    "let us outline here the derivation within the wilsonian approach .",
    "we shall briefly comment on the corresponding calculation within the field theoretical rg in the concluding paragraph .",
    "starting point in the wilsonian approach is the exact hierarchy of rg flow equations for the irreducible self - energy @xmath31 and the one - particle irreducible @xmath32-point vertices @xmath33 describing the change of these quantities as we vary the infrared cutoff @xmath34 . here",
