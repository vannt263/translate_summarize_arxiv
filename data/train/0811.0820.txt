    "the presence of these black holes could have had dramatic consequences .",
    "if a 100-@xmath4 black hole is radiating at the eddington limit with ten per cent radiative efficiency , beginning at @xmath5 , it will attain a final mass at @xmath6 of greater than @xmath7 , implying that accretion onto these black holes is a viable explanation for the @xmath8 quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "a typical approach is that described by @xcite , where some fraction of the rest - mass energy accreted onto the black hole is deposited as thermal energy within a finite volume of surrounding matter as an additional term in the energy equation .",

    "letter _ we focus on the evolution of remnant black holes immediately following the death of their progenitor pop iii stars .",
    "our simulations account for the ionizing radiation from the pop iii star itself , which photoevaporates the gas within its host halo .",
    "because the simulations are run from cosmological initial conditions , we can follow the fate of the black hole as it encounters cold , dense gas from nearby halos , as well as the recombining gas in the relic h  ii region .",
    "we model the ionizing radiation from accretion onto the black hole by full radiative transfer coupled to the hydrodynamics , revealing how it regulates black hole growth and alters the nearby environment .",
    "we present our simulation method in  2 and our results in  3 .",
    "we conclude with a discussion in  4 .",
    "we will present the results of two otherwise identical simulations runs , one in which ionizing radiation from the accretion is included ( `` feedback '' ) , and one in which it is not ( `` no feedback '' ) .",
    "the simulations with no feedback were first presented in @xcite .",
    "we use the code enzo @xcite to simulate the formation of the first star within a periodic volume 250 comoving kpc on a side .",
    "the dark matter particle mass within the central @xmath9 comoving kpc , where refinement is allowed to proceed adaptively , is @xmath10 .",
    "a fully - formed 100 @xmath4-star is assumed to form when the overdensity is @xmath11 and the molecular hydrogen mass fraction is greater than @xmath12 .",
    "the star is assigned an ionizing photon luminosity of @xmath13  s@xmath14 and shines for its main sequence lifetime of 2.7  myr .",

    "the simulation set up and method , see @xcite ( the set up is just the same as there , but with a different set of random modes for the initial conditions ) . after the lifetime of the star",
    ", radiation is turned off and it is assumed to collapse directly to a black hole with the same mass , position , and velocity as the progenitor .",
    "we track the position of the black hole as the relic hii region evolves for 210 myr from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "we base our model for the spectrum of accreting gas on an approximate form of the multi - color disk + power - law model adopted by @xcite .",
    "we take @xmath17 for @xmath18  ev , @xmath19 for 200 ev @xmath20  kev , and @xmath21 for @xmath22  kev .",
    "this implies a mean photoelectron energy of 460 ev , which we take as our monochramatic photon energy .",
    "while admittedly crude , our model is adequate in this context , where we focus on the larger scale environment on 10 - 1000 pc scales . neglecting dissociating radiation places an upper limit on positive feedback effects , and is therefore conservative in this respect .",
    "the normalization of the total luminosity is obtained by assuming that ten per cent of the rest mass energy of matter falling in is converted to radiation , and the accretion rate is determined from the bondi - hoyle @xcite formula , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the sound speed of the gas and @xmath25 is the velocity of the black hole relative to nearby gas . the bondi radius , @xmath26  cm  @xmath27 , is close to our resolution limit , indicating the local conditions at the black hole are appropriate for determining the accretion rate .",

    "the black hole eventually encounters a nearby halo with which its own host halo is merging , after which the evolution depends on whether or not radiative feedback due to accretion is included . without feedback included , the path through density - temperature space oscillates between cold dense gas close to the neighboring halo s center , to the warmer more rarefied gas in the ambient relic h  ii region , due to the orbital motion of the merging halos . with feedback included , however , the black hole stays in relatively low - density , high - temperature gas for the entire time , partially ionizing and heating gas within hundreds of pc ( figs .",

    "when the clump approaches , the accretion rate rises , accompanied by a shorter heating timescale .",
    "the dotted line in the top panel is the sound crossing time of a 1 pc clump at @xmath3730,000 k. before the clump approaches the black hole for even the first time , the heating timescale becomes shorter than its sound crossing time , and photoevaporation ensues . for a radiative efficiency of ten percent , self - regultation of accretion onto black holes within minihalos occurs at accretion rates some five orders of magnitude below the eddington rate , at about @xmath38 .",
    "we have presented results from a simulation of radiative feedback from accretion onto a remnant black hole of an early pop iii star .",
    "this feedback makes it even more difficult for the black hole to encounter cold , dense gas , further depleting the reservoir of gas available for accretion .",
    "including radiative feedback lowers peak accretion rates from @xmath39 to @xmath40 , indicating that radiative feedback is very efficient at halting accretion .",
    "furthermore , the feedback is sufficiently strong to prevent further cooling and star formation within its host minihalo , inhibiting star formation in the halo over the 200 million years we have evolved it .",
    "further star formation can only occur in larger systems , for which the dark matter potential well is deep enough or within which star formation can occur outside of the center of the halo .",
    "these results are in agreeement with previous work , which indicated that massive pop iii stars forming in minihalos with mass @xmath41 photoevaporate the halo gas from the inside out , leaving any remnant black hole starved , at least momentarily , of accreting material @xcite . in particular",
    ", @xcite showed that this photevaporation was likely to delay significant accretion for on the order of 100 million years , creating an early `` bottleneck '' in the black hole s growth .",
    "our results imply that the situation is likely to be even more drastic , because radiative feedback is so effective at preventing gas from reaching the center of the halo , even without taking into account the effect of radiation pressure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an appealing alternative scenario for seed black hole formation and accretion was recently discussed by @xcite , in which intermediate mass black holes can form by direct collapse in halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "more detailed numerical simulations of the kind presented here will be required to test this hypothesis .",
    "the possibility that accretion onto these black holes could power miniquasars has received a great deal of attention lately , since their radiation could have significantly increased the ionizing photon budget of the universe and extended the reionization process @xcite .",
    "because their radiation would have a long mean free path , they would also change the topology of reionization , blurring the distinction between ionized and neutral gas .",
    "they could also change the pattern of fluctuations in the 21-cm background before reioinization , as pointed out by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "black hole remnants of pop iii stars that formed in minihalos are not likely to be the origin of the miniquasars .",
    "as we have shown , significant accretion onto these black holes will be delayed until they fall into more massive dwarf galaxies , which are likely to be the sites of significant star formation , perhaps of pop ii stars .",
    "black hole remnants from these objects are likely to be both more numerous , and in locations of higher gas density than the black holes that formed in minihalos , thus replacing the pop iii seeds in models like that of @xcite",
    ".    in future work it will be necessary to determine at which values of the radiative efficiency feedback from black hole accretion becomes irrelevant .",
    "more importantly , we must better constrain the angular distribution ( i.e. beaming ) , intensity , and spectral shape of the radiation produced by the accretion flow around massive early stellar mass black holes in the environments we detailed here .",
    "such modeling will require far more spatial and temporal dynamic range than has hitherto been feasible ."
