    "heavy - fermion systems have provided opportunities to study various types of superconductivity .",
    "for example , the ce - based compound @xmath3 has two kinds of superconducting states , one of which observed in higher magnetic fields is a strong candidate for the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov state with finite center - of - mass momentum of the cooper pairs @xcite . in superconductors without inversion symmetry , such as @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the exotic parity mixing between spin - singlet and spin - triplet states is expected to occur due to the existence of the antisymmetric spin - orbit interaction @xcite .",
    "the coexistence of superconductivity and long - range magnetic order has been observed in several ferromagnets ( @xmath6 , urhge , etc . ) as well as in several antiferromegnets ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , etc . )",
    "a variety of experimental and theoretical efforts have been devoted to understanding those exotic states .",
    "superconductivity with simple @xmath0-wave pairing symmetry is another intriguing phenomenon in heavy - fermion systems .",
    "usually , heavy - fermion superconductors favor the nodal pairing states , such as the @xmath9-wave and @xmath10-wave states , rather than the @xmath0-wave state .",
    "this is because the strong coulomb repulsion in those systems is incompatible with intrasite cooper pairing , which gives the nodal @xmath9-wave and @xmath10-wave states .",
    "in fact , nuclear resonance [ nmr and nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) ] experiments have demonstrated that many of the heavy - fermion superconductors possess the nodal superconducting gaps @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "some heavy - fermion compounds , such as @xmath11 @xcite , @xmath12 @xcite , and the recently reinvestigated @xmath13 @xcite , are known to exhibit @xmath0-wave superconductivity . in the bcs theory ,",
    "such @xmath0-wave superconductivity is explained as a result of the electron - phonon attraction between electrons .",
    "however , as mentioned above , heavy - fermion compounds have the strong coulomb repulsion , which is considered as the dominant interaction between electrons .",
    "thus , the @xmath0-wave superconductivity in those compounds may come from another mechanism .",
    "the multiorbital nature is one of the characteristic features of heavy - fermion systems , which are composed of itinerant electrons in the conduction orbitals ( @xmath1 electrons ) and localized electrons in the @xmath2 orbitals ( @xmath2 electrons ) .",
    "the correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 electrons leads to various intriguing phenomena , such as the kondo effect @xcite , quantum critical behavior @xcite , and magnetic orderings due to the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida interaction @xcite .",
    "recently , the importance of such orbital degrees of freedom has also been recognized in the studies of superconductivity in the other strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "for example , the material dependence in the critical temperature of cuprates has been explained by using the multiorbital hubbard models @xcite .",
    "moreover , the multiorbital nature is considered to be the key for understanding the high-@xmath14 superconducting properties in iron pnictides @xcite .",
    "previous studies @xcite suggested that the multiorbital nature can be a source of @xmath0-wave superconductivity in heavy - fermion systems .",
    "hanzawa and yosida @xcite and spaek @xcite discussed the interorbital cooper pairing between @xmath1 and @xmath2 electrons , which we call the `` @xmath1-@xmath2 pairing , '' as a possible mechanism for @xmath0-wave superconductivity .",
    "they estimated the order of the critical temperature in the periodic anderson model with infinitely large coulomb repulsion .",
    "more recently , the present authors @xcite also studied the @xmath1-@xmath2 pairing for finite coulomb repulsion , and presented a mean - field phase diagram of the @xmath0-wave superconducting state .",
    "note , however , that the mean - field approximation can not properly describe local charge , spin , and orbital fluctuation effects , which are crucial in heavy - fermion systems .",
    "thus more sophisticated treatment is required to achieve a deeper understanding of the nature of the interorbital pairing .    in this paper",
    ", we use the variational cluster approach ( vca ) @xcite to study @xmath0-wave superconductivity in heavy - fermion systems .",
    "the vca can properly take into account the local coulomb repulsion @xcite and allows us to deal with various long - range orders , such as charge - density - wave @xcite , @xmath9-wave superconducting @xcite , and antiferromagnetic @xcite orders . here , we apply the vca to the standard periodic anderson model considering all three types of @xmath0-wave cooper pairings , i.e. , between @xmath1 electrons ( @xmath1-@xmath1 pairing ) , between @xmath2 electrons ( @xmath2-@xmath2 pairing ) , and between @xmath1 and @xmath2 electrons ( @xmath1-@xmath2 pairing ) .",
    "we also consider possible antiferromagnetic order , which has been shown to emerge when the coulomb repulsion is sufficiently strong @xcite .",
    "we calculate those order parameters and find five different phases depending on the parameters . at half filling , the system undergoes a second - order phase transition from nonmagnetic kondo insulator to antiferromagnetic state when we increase the coulomb repulsion .",
    "away from half filling , we find the @xmath0-wave superconducting phase , in which all the superconducting order parameters ( @xmath1-@xmath1 , @xmath2-@xmath2 , and @xmath1-@xmath2 pairings ) have finite values .",
    "we also find the coexistence phase of the @xmath0-wave superconductivity and long - range antiferromagnetic order in a region closer to half filling . in the vca , the self - energy of the original system is approximated by that of a reference system consisting of isolated clusters .",
    "an advantage of the vca is that it can treat symmetry - breaking states by assuming effective fields called the `` weiss fields '' in the reference system .",
    "we compare two different reference systems with and without the weiss field that acts as a pair potential for the @xmath1-@xmath2 pairing , and conclude that the formation of cooper pairs between @xmath1 and @xmath2 electrons is indeed an essential mechanism to stabilize the @xmath0-wave superconducting states in heavy - fermion systems .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we introduce the periodic anderson model and extend the formulation of the vca to describe the @xmath0-wave superconductivity in the model . in sec .",

    "the final section , sec . [ sec5 ] , is devoted to conclusions .",
    "we consider the periodic anderson model , which is believed to capture the essential physics of heavy - fermion systems .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) creates an itinerant @xmath1 electron ( a localized @xmath2 electron ) with spin @xmath18 at site @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",

    "( [ h_cluster ] ) , the cluster hamiltonian @xmath34 includes four types of weiss - field terms , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "the first three terms allow for describing the @xmath1-@xmath1 , @xmath2-@xmath2 , and @xmath1-@xmath2 pairing orders , respectively .",
    "the last term gives long - range antiferromagnetic order .",
    "the corresponding weiss fields , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , are determined by the variational conditions as mentioned below . to keep the thermodynamic consistency @xcite , the cluster chemical potential @xmath43 is also treated as a variational parameter .",
    "we denote the set of these variational parameters as @xmath44 .",
    "we assume that the weiss field @xmath42 acts only on @xmath2 electrons , which is justified by the fact that the antiferromagnetic order in this system is mainly due to the coulomb repulsion between @xmath2 electrons .",
    "we introduce the following nambu spinor defined on each cluster : @xmath45 where the two sites on the cluster @xmath28 are labeled @xmath46 and @xmath47 . by diagonalizing the two - site hamiltonian @xmath34",

    "<S> we study @xmath0-wave cooper pairing in heavy - fermion systems . we analyze the periodic anderson model by means of the variational cluster approach ( vca ) focusing on the interorbital cooper pairing between a conduction electron ( @xmath1 electron ) and an @xmath2 electron , called the `` @xmath1-@xmath2 pairing . '' </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the @xmath0-wave superconductivity appears coexisting with long - range antiferromagnetic order when electrons or holes are doped into the system at half filling . </S>",
    "<S> the antiferromagnetic order vanishes when the doping concentration exceeds a certain critical value , leading to a pure @xmath0-wave superconducting state . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the comparative study with different reference systems used in the vca shows that the interorbital @xmath1-@xmath2 pairing is essential for the appearance of the @xmath0-wave superconductivity .    </S>",
