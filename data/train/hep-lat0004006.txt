    "<S> we explore methods of extrapolating lattice calculations of hadronic observables to the physical regime , while respecting the constraints of chiral symmetry and heavy quark effective theory . in particular , we extrapolate lattice results for magnetic moments of the spin-1/2 baryon octet to the physical pion mass and compare with experimental measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the success previously reported for extrapolations of the nucleon magnetic moments carries over to the @xmath0 baryons . </S>",
    "<S> a study of the residual discrepancies in the @xmath1 baryon moments suggests that it is important to have new simulation data with a more realistic strange quark mass .    </S>",

    "<S> however , computational limitations mean that hadronic observables , such as masses and magnetic moments , are calculated at quark masses much larger than their physical values . although improvements in algorithms and computer speed will allow lattice calculations of hadronic observables to be performed much closer to the physical regime , these improvements will proceed over many years . in the meantime </S>",
    "<S> it is imperative that one has an understanding of how to extrapolate lattice results , obtained at large quark masses , to the physical world .    </S>",
    "<S> a difficult problem encountered in calculating hadronic observables at heavy quark masses on the lattice is that chiral perturbation theory is not applicable in this heavy quark mass regime . </S>",
    "<S> however , chiral perturbation theory predicts that near the chiral limit there are important non - analytic terms as a function of the quark mass , @xmath2 ( or equivalently of @xmath3 , as @xmath4 in this range ) , in the expansion of a physical observable . </S>",
    "<S> this non - analytic behaviour must be taken into account in _ any _ extrapolation to the physical regime .    </S>",
    "<S> here we focus on linking lattice calculations of magnetic moments of the spin-@xmath5 baryon octet to the physical world . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we follow an extrapolation procedure first introduced for the nucleon magnetic moments which builds in the non - analytic behaviour of the magnetic moments near the chiral limit , as well as the correct heavy quark behaviour @xcite . in the case of the nucleon , </S>",
    "<S> this extrapolation procedure predicts @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( see fig .  5 of ref.@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this agrees well with the experimental measurements of @xmath8 and @xmath9 . here </S>",
    "<S> we explore the application of this procedure to octet baryons in general .    </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic moment results used here are extracted from the lattice qcd calculations of ref .  @xcite . while the results are now quite old , they continue to be the _ only _ lattice estimates of the spin-@xmath5 baryon octet magnetic moments available at the moment . </S>",
    "<S> these results were all obtained at pion masses above @xmath10mev . </S>",
    "<S> we extrapolate these results as functions of the pion mass , @xmath11 , to the physical pion mass of @xmath12mev , to obtain the physical magnetic moment predictions . </S>",
    "<S> because the lattice calculations are quenched , we expect that there are errors in the lattice data which we have been unable to take into account . </S>",
    "<S> however , as explained in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , these errors are expected to be on the scale of the statistical errors . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , an ideal extrapolation of magnetic moments would use full qcd lattice results which are unavailable at the moment .    </S>",
    "<S> extrapolations    to extrapolate the lattice calculations of the magnetic moments we use the pad@xmath13 approximant : _ </S>",
    "<S> i()= [ pade ] where @xmath14 , corresponding to the @xmath15 baryon , is fixed model - independently by chiral perturbation theory and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are allowed to vary to best fit the data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this formula builds in the chiral behaviour at small @xmath18 , governed by @xmath14 , as well as the correct heavy quark behaviour , as discussed in the following .    </S>",
    "<S> the goldstone boson loops resulting from dynamical chiral symmetry breaking mean that the baryon magnetic moments exhibit certain model independent , non - analytic behaviour in the quark masses . using an expansion about the chiral su(3 ) limit , one finds that the magnetic moments of the octet baryons ( in nuclear magnetons , @xmath19 ) are given by _ </S>",
    "<S> i = _ </S>",
    "<S> i+_x=,k_i^(x)m_x +  [ chiral ] where the ellipses represent higher order terms , including logarithms @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 is the pion decay constant in the chiral limit ( @xmath21 mev ) and @xmath22 is the nucleon mass . for our purposes , namely extrapolating lattice data at fixed strange quark mass ( @xmath23 ) as a function of the light quark mass ( @xmath2 ) , it is preferable to expand about the su(2 ) chiral limit . </S>",
    "<S> the cloudy bag calculations in ref.@xcite showed that goldstone boson loops are suppressed like @xmath24 at large @xmath25 ( comparable to @xmath26 ) . </S>",
    "<S> although this result is model dependent , the lattice simulations themselves do not show a rapid variation with @xmath25 at values of order @xmath26 or higher , thus supporting the general conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> one therefore expects that the kaon loops should be relatively small and slowly varying as a function of @xmath2 . and @xmath23 is fixed and large . ] </S>",
    "<S> they can therefore be absorbed in the fit parameters @xmath27 and @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the rapid variation of @xmath11 with @xmath2 means that the leading non - analytic behaviour in @xmath11 must be treated explicitly .    </S>",
    "<S> it is simple to see that the pad@xmath13 approximant , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pade ] ) , guarantees the correct behaviour of the magnetic moments in the chiral su(2 ) limit . </S>",
    "<S> expanding eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pade ] ) about @xmath28 we find @xmath29 in order to reproduce the leading non - analytic behaviour of the chiral expansion in our fit we fix @xmath14 to the value @xmath30 for the @xmath15 octet baryon . </S>",
    "<S> the one - loop corrected estimates @xcite of the coefficients @xmath31 and @xmath14 are given in table  [ table : chi ] .    </S>",
    "<S> .one - loop corrected estimates of @xmath31 ( in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ chiral ] ) ) and @xmath32 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the case of the nucleon , the fits given here ( figs </S>",
    "<S> .  1 and 2 ) are slightly different from those given in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , as we omit the second set of lattice results ( these were extracted from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite which dealt with the nucleon only ) in order to produce a consistent set of graphs for the entire baryon octet . </S>",
    "<S> however , the nucleon fits shown here still give excellent agreement with experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> the physical magnetic moment predictions for the @xmath33 and @xmath34 are also in good agreement with experiment .    using magnetic moment values predicted by the pad@xmath13 approximant we can calculate the ratio of the @xmath35 and @xmath36 magnetic moments . </S>",
    "<S> the simple quark model predicts that this ratio is given by = ( 4- ) which becomes = ( 4- ) if we take each quark magnetic moment to be given by the dirac moment of its constituent mass . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the ratio is less than 1 for @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> this disagrees with the experimentally measured value of @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> however , using the predictions of the pad@xmath13 approximant , we obtain a value of 1.15 for this ratio , which is in excellent agreement with the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> this is a good indication that meson cloud effects must be included in an extrapolation of lattice results to the physical regime .    </S>",
    "<S> the lattice calculations of baryon magnetic moments used in this letter were made with a strange quark mass of approximately @xmath39  mev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is much heavier than the physical mass of the strange quark of @xmath40 mev at a scale 2 gev , taken from a careful analysis of qcd sum rules for @xmath41 decay @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of the strange quark to the @xmath0 baryon magnetic moments is very small . </S>",
    "<S> lattice qcd calculations indicate that the contribution of a singly represented quark in a baryon is half that anticipated by su(6 ) spin - flavour symmetry @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence the heavy strange quark mass will have a subtle effect on the @xmath0 moments . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the strange quarks dominate the @xmath42 and @xmath1 magnetic moments . </S>",
    "<S> thus the heavy strange quark produces a large error in the lattice data for these baryons , which so far we have not taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> this is reflected in the predictions of the @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath35 magnetic moments which are smaller in magnitude than the experimental measurements in all cases .    in an attempt to correct for the effect of the large strange quark mass considered in the lattice calculations , we average the magnetic moment lattice results of each @xmath45 baryon with magnetic moment results of a light - quark equivalent baryon . are not available . ] this procedure interpolates between magnetic moment lattice results produced with heavy strange quarks and those produced with zero strange quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> these averaged results have an effective strange quark mass closer to the physical strange quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> we have also used the pad@xmath13 approximant to extrapolate the averaged results . </S>",
    "<S> the effect on the @xmath0 moments is subtle ( see table  [ table : fit ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the case of @xmath35 , this method is sufficient to reproduce the empirical @xmath35 moment ( as shown by the dashed line in fig .  4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> there is a remaining discrepancy in the value predicted for the @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly the present estimate of the correction for the heavy strange quark mass is somewhat crude . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore regard it as very important to have new simulation data with a realistic strange quark mass . at that stage </S>",
    "<S> it may also be necessary to include kaon loop effects , because the transition @xmath46 is energetically favoured , and will make a negative contribution to the @xmath44 magnetic moment .    </S>",
    "<S> conclusion we have shown that the pad@xmath13 approximant which was introduced to extrapolate lattice results for the magnetic moments of the nucleon , is also successful in predicting magnetic moments for the spin-@xmath5 baryon octet . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic moment values predicted by the fits for the @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 compare well with experimental data . as a first estimate of the correction to be expected if a more realistic strange quark mass were used , we averaged lattice results for the @xmath49 baryons with the magnetic moments of the corresponding light - quark baryons . </S>",
    "<S> this had a small effect on the predictions for the @xmath0 baryon magnetic moments , but significantly improved the @xmath1 baryon results . in the case of @xmath35 , </S>",
    "<S> the averaging procedure produced good agreement with the experimental results . in the future we hope to perform a similar extrapolation procedure using more precise magnetic moment lattice data , calculated with realistic strange quark masses . at that stage </S>",
    "<S> it may also be necessary to include the kaon loop corrections , especially for the doubly strange @xmath1 hyperons . </S>"
