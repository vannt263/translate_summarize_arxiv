    "@xmath0 car is a binary system @xcite composed of a very massive primary star @xcite and a hotter and less luminous evolved main sequence secondary star . despite two decades of detailed observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) and modelling ( e.g. , @xcite ) there are disagreements over two important properties of the binary system .",
    "these are the masses of the two stars and the orientation of the eccentric orbit .",
    "the low - masses model assumes that @xmath0 car is at its eddington luminosity limit and a mass of @xmath5 is derived @xcite .",
    "some studies take it to be the mass of the primary star , while other assumes that the combined masses of the two stars amounts to that mass with @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the high - masses model was developed by us @xcite under the assumption that most of the extra energy released during the 18371856 great eruption ( ge ) of @xmath0 car originated from high accretion rate onto the secondary star .",
    "there are models that explain the ge with only one star ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and others that use three stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the ge was agiant eruption and a sn impostor , which is the group of eruptive massive stars within the more general groups of intermediate luminosity optical transients ( ilots ; @xcite ) .",
    "in @xcite we presented the high - accretion - powered ilots ( hapi ) model , according to which all ilots are powered by high accretion rate onto a main sequence ( ms ) , or a star slightly evolved off the ms @xcite . according to the hapi model , then , the luminosity peaks of the great eruption resulted from accretion onto the companion close to periastron passages .",
    "those peaks are @xmath8@xmath9 years apart . if one assumes that the peaks are related to peristron passage , and occur about the same time after ( or before ) periastron , the separation between the peaks can be inferred as the orbital period .",
    "the second peak came after the eruption has started , and mass was lost .",
    "therefore the orbital period is smaller than the time interval between the peaks .",
    "we adopted a value of @xmath10 years .",
    "the present orbital period is @xmath11 years , suggesting that during the great eruption the orbital period has increased .",
    "the orbital period changed as the secondary accreted mass , and as mass was lost from the binary system , both as a wind from the primary star and as jets from the secondary star .",
    "in that study @xcite we found that for the hapi mechanism to work within the orbital changes constraints , the two stars should have a significantly larger masses than @xmath12 .",
    "the masses should be in the range of @xmath13@xmath14 and @xmath15@xmath16 .",
    "this high - masses model is further supported by evolution of massive stars on the hr diagram .",
    "the calculations of @xcite show that a zero - age main sequence ( zams ) star with an initial mass of @xmath17 is required to explain the present luminosity of the primary of @xmath0 car .",
    "indeed , modern stellar evolution tracks of @xmath18 stars even when rotation is considered ( @xcite ; @xcite ) do not reach that luminosity , and more massive models of @xmath19 are required , as found by @xcite .",
    "the primary lost large amounts of mass to the bipolar nebula around @xmath0 car , the homunculus ( @xcite ) .",
    "when the large mass loss along the evolution is considered , a present mass of @xmath20 is compatible with the zams mass inferred above .    in the debate on the orientation of the binary system",
    ", the two sides are holding a literally @xmath21 opposite views .",
    "one side holds that during periastron passages the primary star is closer to us ( @xmath22@xmath23 ; e.g. , @xcite , while the other side holds the view that during periastron passages the secondary star is at its closest location to us ( @xmath24 ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the disagreement on the orientation stems mainly from the controversy on the source of some emission and absorption lines , in particular the lines . in a recent paper @xcite present a study of the variations of some spectral lines with the phase of the binary orbit , based on observations with the ctio 1.5 m telescope .",
    "they attributed the lines to the primary star . in @xcite , on the other hand , we assumed that the lines observed by @xcite are formed in the acceleration zone of the wind blown by the secondary star .",
    "we calculated the doppler shift variations of the lines as a function of orbital phase with the low - masses model of @xmath0 car , and found that a good fit is obtained if the lines are formed in the region where the secondary wind speed is @xmath25 .",
    "in the present study we combine the high - masses model of @xmath0 car with the assumption that the lines originate in the acceleration zone of the secondary stellar wind , and try to fit the new doppler shifts presented by @xcite .",
    "the origin of the visible p  cyg lines ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 ) in the binary system @xmath0 car is in dispute , with different researchers attributing it to different regions , e.g. , the primary star ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we attribute the p  cyg lines to the acceleration zone of the secondary s wind @xcite . a similar dispute exists for the  @xmath31@xmath32 line @xcite .",
    "while @xcite argued that it can not come from the secondary star , we noted that the lines closely follow the behavior of the lines , and attributed it to the secondary wind @xcite .",
    "the effective temperature of the secondary was estimated be @xmath33@xmath34 by @xcite , and more recently @xmath35 by @xcite .",
    "the main arguments for the p  cyg lines origin in the acceleration zone of the wind blown by the secondary star are as follows @xcite .    1 .",
    "the doppler shift of the p  cyg absorption components follows very well the secondary s orbit , as we show in section [ sec : orbital ] for the high - masses model , and as was shown before for the low - masses model @xcite .",
    "the lines are known to originate in stars with temperatures well above @xmath36 , mostly in hydrogen deficient stars ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; further discussion is in section [ sec : summary ] ) .",
    "3 .   the secondary can account for the amount of absorption in the lines , as we show in section [ sec : abs ] .",
    "the doppler shift of the emission follows that of the absorption , as we show in section [ sec : orbital ] .",
    "the secondary mass loss rate is much lower than the primary s .",
    "it is important to mention that most of the lines observed from the @xmath0 car system do originate in the primary and its wind ( the best example is probably the hydrogen lines ; @xcite , ) .",
    "take  @xmath37 line for example .",
    "this line , and many others , originate in the primary . but it shows a p  cyg profile that shifts much less in periastron compared to the p  cyg lines we discuss here",
    ".    it might seem a `` strange '' coincidence that the place in the secondary wind where the are formed , according to our model , has about the same velocity as the primary s wind .",
    "however , even a stranger coincidence exists for a model where the lines are formed in the primary s wind : the area that absorbs the lines would have to change its velocity in the same way the secondary moves around the center of mass of the binary system .    using the assumption that the lines originate in the secondary wind , in the past we fitted their doppler shift variations with orbital phase for the low - masses model ( the conventional model ) of @xmath0 car , with @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the doppler shift of the p  cyg absorption component of the lines was found to be in agreement with the binary orientation with a longitude angle @xmath40 , i.e. , secondary closest to us at periastron .",
    "we here upgrade the model to include the new doppler shifts presented recently by @xcite , and the high - masses model that better fits the luminosity and the behavior of @xmath0 car during the great eruption according to the hapi model .    in fitting the lines doppler shifts with orbital phase we scan the following parameter space .    1 .",
    "the eccentricity is @xmath41@xmath42 .",
    "inclination angle ( the angle between a line perpendicular to the orbital plane and the line of sight ) is also in the consensus to be @xmath43 .",
    "the orbital period is @xmath44 days @xcite .",
    "4 .   for the masses",
    "we use our results @xcite that the present masses are @xmath13@xmath14 and @xmath15@xmath16 .",
    "we take here for the present masses of @xmath0 car components @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we assume that the observer is behind the secondary at periastron , namely @xmath47 .",
    "we note that there is inconsistency in some papers regarding the exact epoch of periastron , or phase @xmath48 .",
    "@xcite used jd 2454842.5 for the 2009 periastron passage .",
    "@xcite used jd 2454860 as a reference time for the event ( see also discussion at the appendix of @xcite ) . the uncertainty in determining",
    "the time of periastron may cause the change in radial velocity to appear after periastron rather than before , or vice versa .",
    "evidently the observations collected so far from @xmath0 car are insufficient for determining the exact time of periastron .",
    "we will adopt an intermediate value between the references above , @xmath49 jd 2454850 .",
    "this value coincides with having the sharp variation in radial velocity of the lines studied here at periastron .",
    "however , one should bear in mind that the uncertainty of the periastron epoch is of @xmath50 days .",
    "we corrected the orbital phases inferred from the observation dates in this work to have phase 0 at @xmath51 .",
    "based only on geometric considerations , i.e. , neglecting variations of the wind speed near periastron passage and stochastic wind speed variations , we here use our model to fit the observations of @xcite .",
    "the orbital velocity of the secondary relative to the primary , @xmath52 , is converted to the velocity relative to the center of mass @xmath53     \\left [ \\frac{2}{r(t)}-\\frac{1}{a } \\right]^{1/2 } , \\label{v_m1}\\ ] ] that can be written as @xmath54 \\left[\\frac{2 \\pi g}{p}\\right]^{1/3 } \\left [ \\frac{2}{\\tilde{r}(t)}-1 \\right]^{1/2 } \\\\        & = f_m \\left[\\frac{2 \\pi g}{p}\\right]^{1/3 } \\left [ \\frac{2}{\\tilde{r}(t)}-1 \\right]^{1/2}. \\end{split } \\label{v_m2}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 .",
    "the entire stellar mass dependency is embedded in the factor @xmath56 .",
    "for the low - masses model ( @xmath38 and @xmath57 ) its value is @xmath58 , while for the high - masses model ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) it is @xmath59 .",
    "therefore the amplitude of the fit with the new parameters is less than @xmath60 larger than the amplitude using the old parameters .",
    "on top of @xmath61 there are factors related to the observation angle @xmath62 , the inclination @xmath63 , and the eccentricity @xmath64 . from the result",
    "we subtract the constant velocity @xmath65 of the zone in the secondary wind where the lines are absorbed , or the average velocity of the emitting gas when the peak emission is fitted .",
    "figure [ fig : heimin ] shows in a blue - solid line our fit to the observed radial velocity absorption component of lines from @xcite and of @xcite .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig : heimin ] that our fit to the new lines at @xmath66 and @xmath28 is not as good as our fit to the lines studied by @xcite .",
    "we attribute this to contamination of the two @xmath28 and @xmath66 lines by lines .",
    "this contamination was mentioned by @xcite .",
    "more observations of lines , specifically the  @xmath67 line , were taken for the 2009 event by @xcite , and for the 2014.6 event by @xcite .",
    "the later paper summarizes observations of that line from the previous 3 events ( 2003.5 , 2009 , and 2014.6 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : hei4714 ] shows how our model fits the observations .",
    "we used the same model we used for the other lines in figure [ fig : heimin ] , but @xmath68 .",
    "we take this slightly different value than the value of @xmath69 that was used in figure [ fig : heimin ] to match the average of the absorption component s radial velocity .",
    "the different values mean either that the  @xmath67 line is absorbed in the wind slightly closer to the wind origin on the secondary star , or that there are large variations and uncertainties in the derived doppler shifts near periastron passages .",
    "@xcite found that the 2014.6 event was different than pervious events , and according to their interpretation in the framework of the accretion model , it showed signs of less accretion onto the secondary close to periastron , indicating weaker primary wind .",
    "the line flux increased significantly in 20092014 compared to 19982003 .",
    "the absorption of the  @xmath67 line disappeared 8 days before periastron and re - appeared 8 days after ( assuming our @xmath51 ) .",
    "the radial velocities are lower in the 2014.6 event compared to previous events .",
    "in fact , for fitting only the data from 2014.6 it would be better to use @xmath70 , keeping the rest of the parameters unchanged .",
    "this behavior , together with the large fluctuations in the doppler shifts near periastron as seen in the different figures , suggest that the velocities of the regions where lines are formed in the different regions of the secondary wind vary from cycle to cycle and in short time scales near periastron passages .",
    "we should therefore aim at fitting the general behavior of the doppler shift variations with orbital phase ; a perfect fit to the doppler shifts of this interacting binary system can not be achieved using the geometrical effects alone .",
    "we used the same principles we used for fitting the radial velocity variations of the absorption lines to fit the _ emission _",
    "peak bisector velocity of the  @xmath71 line across the 2009 event observed by @xcite .",
    "we find that a value of @xmath72 for the average velocity of the gas emitting the line gives the best results .",
    "figure [ fig : heivb ] shows the fit we obtained , together with the observations of the emission peak bisector velocity of the  @xmath71 .",
    "we present two other cases with @xmath40 ( secondary star closer to the observer at periastron ) , one with an eccentricity of @xmath73 , and the other is the low - masses model from @xcite .",
    "we also show two models where the line is assumed to originate in the primary stellar wind .",
    "one is our simple geometric model , but the line is emitted by the primary stellar wind and @xmath74 ( dashed - dotted line ) , and the second is the fit presented by @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the models where the line is emitted by the secondary stellar wind and the secondary star is in the foreground at periastron result in a much better fit to the observations .",
    "we next test our model against the variation in the doppler shift of the absorption component of the  @xmath75@xmath76 lines , taken from both @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we use here @xmath68 . the  @xmath77 line observed by @xcite",
    "has clear emission peaks close to periastron , but these were not clear in the profiles of @xcite .",
    "we fit also the emission component of the  @xmath77 line , with @xmath78 .",
    "the fits are presented in figure [ fig : nii ] .",
    "though the and lines intensities behave differently , the radial velocity of the  @xmath77 emission component follows that of the absorption component amazingly well .",
    "also , the entire lines - formation regions show the same doppler shift variation .",
    "such a behavior can not be explained in frame of a model where the and lines - formation regions change their location within the primary wind .",
    "the main driver of the variations in the doppler shifts is the pure orbital motion .",
    "however , it is not the only one .",
    "a variation in location within the secondary wind in our model can take place , and it is even expected to occur . as the secondary approached periastron , its wind properties change , most likely due to accretion of gas from the primary stellar wind @xcite .",
    "the accretion phase lasts for several weeks , but the influence on the secondary stellar wind properties can last few months after the event , until the accreted mass is removed by the restoring secondary wind @xcite .",
    "it is therefore very reasonable that lines will be absorbed in different locations across periastron .",
    "this secondary effect is the main cause for the deviation from our doppler - based model , as seen in the figures .",
    "according to @xcite the amount of absorption of the  @xmath28 p  cyg line reaches up to @xmath79 .",
    "this line , however , shows different orbital change ( probably because it is blended ) and is _ not _ one of the lines we claim to originate in the secondary wind ( see section [ sec : orbital ] ) .",
    "the lines we attribute to the secondary , show much less absorption .",
    "the  @xmath80 p  cyg line , for example , shows @xmath81 absorption near periastron @xcite .",
    "we can use this to better constrain the properties of the two stars .    the maximum absorption , assuming it occurs in the secondary wind , is obtained when @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the luminosities of the primary and the secondary , respectively , and @xmath85 and @xmath85 are their fractions within the line absorption waveband .    according to @xcite , the  @xmath80 shows @xmath81 absorption for a range between @xmath86@xmath87 . taking @xmath88 in equation ( [ eq : absorption ] )",
    "we get the requirement that @xmath89 assuming blackbody radiation , and taking conventional parameters for the temperatures of the primary and the secondary @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively , we obtain @xmath92 .",
    "this means that according to equation ( [ eq : absorption2 ] ) , the luminosity ratio needs to satisfy @xmath93 .",
    "according to the conventional parameters , the ratio @xmath94 , so this leads to a contradiction .",
    "it is not possible to find for the conventional model , a point in the stellar evolution path , even with a different effective temperature , that would be even close to satisfy that requirement .",
    "we therefore conclude that the two stars must have a smaller luminosity ratio , and consequently smaller mass ratio , as is expected in the massive stars model .",
    "they should also have a smaller temperature ratio to make the requirement in equation ( [ eq : absorption2 ] ) easier to meet .",
    "for the massive stars model we propose , we can track the evolution of @xmath45 and @xmath46 stars ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) , and try to find a reasonable set of parameters that satisfies the above equation .",
    "we find that if we take @xmath95 @xcite , @xmath96 @xcite , which gives @xmath97 , then the requirement from equation ( [ eq : absorption2 ] ) becomes @xmath98 .",
    "and indeed , stellar evolution tracks give @xmath99 and @xmath100 , satisfying the condition .",
    "we used spectroscopic observations of @xmath0 car close to the 2009 periastron passage ( @xcite ; @xcite,@xcite ) to show they support earlier suggestions that companion is in the foreground at periastron ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we assumed that the and spectral lines originate in the acceleration zone of the secondary star of @xmath0 car ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we then took the secondary to be closest to us at periastron passages , i.e. , @xmath40 .",
    "we further used the high - masses model of @xmath0 car with component masses of @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "these masses better fit evolutionary tracks of massive stars that cross the locations of the two stars on the hr diagram , than the commonly used masses of @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "a massive primary star with initial mass larger than @xmath101 , and a secondary star with an initial mass larger than @xmath102 are supported by stellar evolution calculations for very massive stars ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the high masses , more generally in the range of @xmath13@xmath14 and @xmath15@xmath16 , can account also for the powering of the nineteenth century great eruption by mass accretion onto the secondary star ( the hapi model ; @xcite ) . for the eccentricity and inclination angle we used the commonly accepted values of @xmath103 and @xmath4 , respectively . as evident from figs .",
    "[ fig : heimin][fig : nii ] we could fit the general variation of the doppler shifts with orbital phase . therefore , the suggestion that the secondary star is in the foreground at periastron ( e.g. , @xcite ) is definitely tenable .",
    "the suggestion that the primary star is in the foreground at periastron seems to encounter problems , e.g. , as evident from the dashed black line in figure [ fig : hei4714 ] that is the model proposed by @xcite .    in some cases",
    "the opposite model , of a line originating from the primary stellar wind and the primary star is in the foreground at periastron passages , might fit part of the doppler shifts , e.g. , fitting the data from @xcite in figure [ fig : heimin ] .",
    "however , this model has too low amplitudes both at periastron passages , as evident from all figures , and away from periastron passages , e.g. , right side of figure [ fig : hei4714 ] .    in the present study we considered only the role of the orbital motion on the variation of the doppler shift with orbital phase .",
    "it appears clear from the fluctuations in the doppler shift values and from the non - perfect fitting that the velocity of the zone responsible for the formation of each line is changing .",
    "both stochastic variations and variation with orbital phase , noticeably near periastron passages , exist .",
    "these variations are another manifestation of the unrelaxed nature of this binary system .",
    "the three unknowns about the binary system discussed here are : ( i ) masses of two stars ;",
    "( ii ) orbital orientation ; ( iii ) exact periastron time .",
    "the masses of the two stars were obtained by @xcite as explained in section [ sec : intro ] .",
    "here we showed that the mass estimate obtained by @xcite also allows to fit radial velocities of the lines .",
    "the orbital orientation is the main parameter discussed here in detail .",
    "the time of periastron is uncertain .",
    "we used a fixed value here and did not fine - tuned its value .",
    "it may however be possible to use the he i and other lines to get a better constrain for its time .",
    "what we find here is that our fits are consistent with periastron time of jd 2454850 but a few days difference is also possible .",
    "in addition to the doppler shifts presented here , there are other arguments that support the suggestion that the secondary star is in the foreground at periastron passages .",
    "the four supporting arguments listed by @xcite include the evolution of the radio emission and the behavior of the  @xmath104 line . in a previous study @xcite",
    "we further argued that the column density toward the x - ray emitting gas , that is the post - shock secondary wind , is more compatible with a binary orientation where for most of the time the secondary star is in the background , being on the foreground only near periastron passages .",
    "another supporting argument was brought by @xcite .",
    "they demonstrated that the asymmetric morphology of the blue and red - shifted components of the outflow at hundreds of astronomical units from @xmath0 car , can be accounted for from the collision of the free primary stellar wind with the slowly expanding dense equatorial gas closer to us .",
    "namely , for most of the orbital period the primary is in the foreground , and at periastron passages the secondary star is in the foreground .",
    "@xcite discovered that the lines were absent from @xmath0 car s spectra prior to the mid 1940s .",
    "they discussed the various difficulties it may pose to models attributing the required he ionizing photons to the the secondary , ionizing the primary wind .",
    "they also conclude that even a much denser primary wind could not have obscured the he ionizing photons coming from the secondary . @xcite and @xcite claimed , however , that the he ionizing photons only moderately penetrate the dense post - shocked primary wind .",
    "therefore if the primary wind at that time was 24 times denser , it should have been enough to change the ionization structure of he in the primary s wind , and prevent the formation of the lines .",
    "these arguments , however , are irrelevant for a model in which the lines originate in the secondary s wind . in the frame of the accretion model ,",
    "however , it is easier to provide an explanation .",
    "a denser primary wind can form a thick accretion belt around the secondary close to periastron @xcite that would last for the entire orbit , providing a shield for its radiation .",
    "even after the belt is gone , the mass that is accreted onto the secondary changes its photospheric structure and makes it cooler , diminishing the he ionizing photons .",
    "this may require that the primary wind before the 1940s was 2030 times denser .",
    "a new study by @xcite suggests that the mass loss could have reached that magnitude or even higher .",
    "@xcite also observed the lines and their velocity shifts from reflected polar spectra at the location known as `` fos4 '' .",
    "they argue it may be a problematic observation for the orbital motion explanation to the doppler shift variations . a similar argument appear in @xcite regarding the  @xmath67 line .",
    "the only direct comparison of fos4 and direct view is in figure 8 of that paper .",
    "though it may at first sight look like the radial velocity of the absorption in fos4 follows that of the direct view , we notice the following : ( 1 ) the observations at @xmath105 and @xmath106 days ( phase @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) show very high radial velocity in absorption , much above other observations of the same line . ( 2 ) at @xmath106 days the value of fos4 is @xmath109 higher",
    ". as the observations are sparse , there is now way to know if this is significant .",
    "it may indicate that the fos4 doppler shift of the absorption is smaller in amplitude and non systematic .",
    "alternatively , it may be a fluctuation .",
    "it is therefore impossible to know if fos4 persistently follows the direct view or not .",
    "a detailed comparison of densely sampled multiple lines is needed in order to check that .",
    "even if it does , it may well be possible that not only polar light is reflected to fos4 and there is some reflection from equatorial regions .",
    "@xcite used the distribution of gas and ionizing radiation around @xmath0 car to constrain the properties of the secondary .",
    "if the limits of @xcite hold , then the secondary mass should be @xmath110 .",
    "a mass of @xmath111 is still within the hapi model for the great eruption .",
    "we here showed that the doppler shifts can be fitted with @xmath39 and @xmath46 any value for @xmath112 in this range can be fitted .",
    "but as stated , because of the luminosity of the primary star and the hapi model for the ge , we prefer the high - masses model .",
    "p cyg profiles in he  i are found in hot hydrogen poor stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . we know from observations that the primary s outer layers consists of about @xmath79 helium ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a few @xmath113 of material from the primary were accreted onto the secondary during the eruptions .",
    "the accreted gas makes the secondary s envelope enriched with helium .",
    "it is very plausible that even though the secondary is hot , its helium lines are stronger than other stars in its evolutionary stage .",
    "clumpiness of the secondary wind @xcite can make part of the gas somewhat cooler , also enhancing the he  i lines .",
    "the very massive primary star of @xmath114 and the very high eccentricity of the binary orbit hints that the system was once a triple system , and that the primary formed by the merger of two ( or more ) stars .",
    "the merger process released large amount of gravitational energy within weeks to months .",
    "such an event can be classified as ilot .",
    "therefore , it may well be that the nineteenth century great eruption was not the first ilot of this system .",
    "we note that the estimates for the masses in the hapi model do not depend on the previous existence or nonexistence of a third star .",
    "the masses of only two stars are relevant for both the calculations done in this paper for spectral fitting , and the calculation done in @xcite for modeling the light curve .",
    "the third star is suggested as a possible easier route to obtain the large mass of the primary , together with a high eccentricity orbit .",
    "but it is well possible that both were obtained with only two stars along the entire evolution ."
