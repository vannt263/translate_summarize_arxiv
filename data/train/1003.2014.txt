    "in order to address several physical problems in gravitational theories , including the important question of averaging in cosmology and the interpretation of cosmological observations @xcite , it is necessary to define an averaged or macroscopic theory of gravity . however , due to the non - linear nature of the gravitational field equations in , for example , einstein s general relativity ( gr ) , it is very difficult to define a mathematically precise and covariant averaging procedure for tensor fields . in previous approaches a @xmath0",
    "cosmological space - time splitting has been employed ( i.e. , this procedure is not generally covariant ) where only scalar quantities are averaged @xcite and a perturbative approach involving averaging the perturbed einstein field equations ( efe ) has been utilized @xcite .    in the macroscopic gravity ( mg )",
    "approach to the averaging problem in gr , which is a fully covariant and exact method , a prescription for the correlation functions which emerge in an averaging of the non - linear field equations ( without which , the averaging of the efe simply amount to definitions of the new averaged terms ) is given , and a new tensor field with its own set of field equations is introduced @xcite . for the cosmological problem ,",
    "additional assumptions are required : with reasonable cosmological assumptions , the correlation tensor in mg takes the form of a spatial curvature @xcite .",
    "the formal mathematical issues of averaging tensors on a differential manifold have recently been revisited @xcite . in particular",
    ", we note that it may be possible to avoid several of the technical problems of averaging by adopting an approach based on scalar curvature invariants @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to construct a mathematical framework within which a consistent theory of averaged geometric quantities on a differentiable manifold can be formulated .",
    "while we develop the formalism with applications to gr in mind ( applications to cosmology will be pursued in future work ) , our primary motive is to set up a smoothing procedure of interest in its own right , similar in spirit to concepts such as ricci flow @xcite .",
    "our intent is to introduce a rigorously defined geometric averaging procedure that captures the intuition of averaging as integrating a quantity over a region @xmath1 and dividing by the volume @xmath2 .",
    "when we average a tensorial object @xmath3 , in order for the averaged object @xmath4 to transform tensorially , @xmath3 has to be parallel transported from each point @xmath5 within @xmath1 to a common reference point when we want to indicate the reference point . ]",
    "@xmath6 . therefore , as in @xcite",
    ", we introduce the weitzenbck connection for parallel transport and argue that , within the context of averaging , frames and connections are more natural geometrical objects on the manifold .",
    "this also suggests alternative theories of gravity ( such as , for example , poincar gauge theories ) as being of interest .",
    "being parallel transported to a reference point @xmath6 , in order to define the average over @xmath1.,height=207 ]",
    "we will assume a differentiable @xmath7-dimensional manifold @xmath8 , equipped with a local frame co - basis @xmath9 whose associated metric @xmath10 is of lorentzian or riemannian signature and a connection form @xmath11 taking values in the lie algebra @xmath12 of the appropriate pseudo - orthogonal structure group @xmath13 , which is @xmath14 for lorentzian manifolds and @xmath15 for the riemannian case .",
    "lower - case latin indices indicate tensors with respect to diffeomorphisms of @xmath8 .",
    "upper - case latin indices transform under @xmath13 .",
    "indices for differential forms will be suppressed when this does not cause confusion .",
    "we will usually take @xmath16 to be the unique torsion - free spin connection associated with the frame field @xmath17 , and in this case , @xmath16 is related to the frame by the cartan structure equation @xmath18 however , it is possible to let @xmath17 and @xmath16 remain independent . in this case , @xmath16 needs to be determined by other means ( see section ( [ theories ] ) ) .",
    "the curvature 2-form of @xmath16 , @xmath19 $ ] is defined as @xmath20 = \\d \\omega^i_j + \\omega^i_k \\wedge \\omega^k_j\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    averaged quantities will generally be denoted with an overline ( i.e. @xmath21 ) whereas quantities defined by a compatibility condition with an averaged field will be denoted with tildes ( i.e. , @xmath22 ) .",
    "in order to carry out the parallel transport procedure alluded to in the introduction , we will need to choose a connection and a curve .",
    "one possibility would be to choose the metric - compatible levi - cevita connection and parallel transport along the geodesic connecting the two points ( if one exists ) .",
    "a difficulty in this choice is that one is required to explicitly calculate the equations for the geodesic .",
    "therefore , we will make another choice , one that does not depend on the choice of the curve which is naturally available in theories formulated in terms of a frame field : the _ weitzenbck connection _ @xmath23@xcite .",
    "this is a connection with non - zero torsion , zero curvature , and zero non - metricity defined via the frame field by @xmath24    the corresponding parallel transport equation for a vector field @xmath25 is then @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the tangent vector to the curve along which the parallel transport takes place .",
    "it can be checked by a direct substitution that @xmath28 solves this equation , where @xmath29 .",
    "the object @xmath30 is the parallel transport operator that maps a vector at point @xmath5 into the parallel transported vector at reference point @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , it can be noted that @xmath30 depends only on the initial and final point and not on the choice of curve connecting the two points ; this reflects the flatness of the weitzenbck connection @xmath23 ( see @xcite for additional details ) .",
    "we now define the average of a tensor field @xmath31 as @xmath32 here , @xmath1 is the region over which the averaging is performed , @xmath2 is the volume of that region ( as measured by the unaveraged frame field ) and primes refer to dependence on the point @xmath5 over which the integration is performed , and @xmath33 is the determinant of the frame field .",
    "it can be readily seen from equation ( [ parasol ] ) that parallel transporting the frame field from point @xmath5 to point @xmath6 will simply give us the frame field at the point @xmath6 .",
    "the corresponding statement is also true for the metric , that is , the average of the metric is the metric itself , which is at odds with the intuitive view of averaging as a smoothing process .",
    "therefore , an alternative process is necessary .",
    "a suggested course of action is to proceed in the following manner .",
    "one starts the process by averaging the spin connection @xmath16 : @xmath34 since @xmath16 is a lie algebra - valued one - form and since the averaging procedure ensures that the same is true of @xmath21 , one concludes that @xmath21 is truly a connection form .",
    "given @xmath21 , can one find a compatible frame field @xmath22 with @xmath21 as its spin connection ?",
    "the cartan structure equation , equation ( [ cart ] ) , has an integrability condition @xmath35 \\wedge \\tilde{e}^j=0 $ ] for @xmath21 and @xmath36 . under what circumstances",
    "is this condition satisfied ?",
    "it is clear that a necessary condition is that @xmath21 take values in a subalgebra of the pseudo - orthogonal lie algebra given by the metric signature . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that this condition is sufficient as well , so the connection determines the metric up to a constant , and therefore the frame up to a constant and a local lorentz transformation .",
    "there are now two possible identifications for the curvature associated with the averaged manifold .",
    "the first is to calculate the corresponding curvature @xmath37 $ ] associated with the averaged spin connection .",
    "the second is to calculate the curvature @xmath38 $ ] and then average to obtain @xmath39}$ ] , which is generally distinct from @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "if we proceed in the latter manner by assuming that @xmath39}$ ] is indeed the curvature of some spin connection @xmath40 , can one find the corresponding spin connection @xmath41 ?",
    "the integrability condition is @xmath42 .",
    "this integrability condition does not hold for _ all _ manifolds , but it is generically satisfied@xcite .",
    "what if any relation exists between @xmath39}$ ] and @xmath37 $ ] ?",
    "a partial result is possible once we discuss how to obtain neighboring averaging regions .",
    "one procedure which yields neighboring averaging regions of similar size and shape to the original averaging region is a process coined `` averaging region coordination '' first described in @xcite and further illustrated in @xcite . in this procedure , the given direction vector at @xmath6 , @xmath43 is mapped ( or coordinated ) to a direction vector for all other points @xmath44 through parallel transport .",
    "the vector @xmath45 is the image of the given directional vector @xmath46 at @xmath6 to each point @xmath47 . given an averaging region @xmath48 at supporting point @xmath6 and a direction vector @xmath43 , one can now obtain a nearby averaging region @xmath49 , by lie dragging @xmath48 a parametric distance @xmath50 along the integral curves of the parallel transported vector field @xmath51 for each point @xmath52 . assuming this  averaging region coordination ",
    "one is able to explicitly calculate the difference in the averaged curvature and the curvature of the averaged spin connection .",

    "this equation can be interpreted as stating that on average , the averaged @xmath60 changes more slowly than the unaveraged @xmath60 .",
