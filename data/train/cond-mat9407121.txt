    "the possibility of detecting quantum interference effects between macroscopically distinguishable states  eigenstates of a variable corresponding to macroscopically different eigenvalues  has received much attention in the last few years .",
    "such interest is motivated by one of the fundamental problems in quantum mechanics : to determine whether quantum - mechanical features can be observed in macroscopic objects @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the detection of a macroscopic superposition is very difficult , due to the unavoidable coupling with the environment and by the consequent dissipation @xcite .",
    "the severity with which dissipation destroys the quantum coherence at macroscopic level has been discussed by several authors .    since the original proposal by yurke and stoler @xcite , who have shown that a coherent state propagating through a kerr medium evolves , under suitable conditions , into a quantum superposition of two coherent states which are 180@xmath0 out of phase with each other ,",
    "many attempts have been made in order to preserve this superposition with detectable effects as , for example , the interference fringes at the output of a homodyne detector .",
    "mecozzi and tombesi @xcite have considered a dissipation model corresponding to a beam splitter with a squeezed vacuum injected into the unused port .",
    "they have shown that the interference pattern may be preserved if the input light is squeezed in a suitable quadrature . as a model for phase - sensitive measurements , kennedy and walls",
    "@xcite suggested the use of a squeezed bath in place of the thermal one , showing a substantial improvement of the quadrature - phase sensitivity . on these lines , buek ,",
    "kim and gantsog @xcite have recently studied the phase 3.0truecm properties of superpositions of coherent states evolving in a squeezed ( phase - sensitive ) amplifier , showing that differently from the phase - insensitive case @xcite , the phase distribution of the schrdinger - cat input state can be preserved for long times .",
    "the above models either suffer a parametrically imposed dynamics for the loss ( beam splitter models@xcite ) , or do not consider the nonlinear coupling generating the superposition state , which is just treated as an initial condition @xcite .",
    "for this reason we consider a model in which both the anharmonic hamiltonian and the interaction with a squeezed bath are taken into account , thus allowing a test of the effect of squeezed fluctuations on the generation of a superposition state starting from a single coherent one .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ model ] we introduce the model and discuss the corresponding master equation . in sec .",
    "[ results ] we present the numerical integration of the master equation and the results of the numerical analysis , showing the efficiency of a squeezed bath in the creation of a `` quasi - superposition state '' . in sec .",
    "[ conclu ] we conclude and summarize the results .",
    "we consider a mode of the electromagnetic field at frequency @xmath1 in a kerr medium coupled to a squeezed bath , namely a reservoir of oscillators whose fluctuations are squeezed @xcite .",
    "the total hamiltonian is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the free kerr hamiltonian of the field mode @xmath4 @xmath5 is the free hamiltonian of the bath , and @xmath6 is the oscillator - reservoir interaction hamiltonian , which in the rotating wave approximation has the form @xmath7 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hamis ] ) and ( [ eq : hamint ] ) @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the boson creation and annihilation operators of the mode , while @xmath10 and @xmath11 are bath operators .",
    "the bath is squeezed and markovian , namely the correlations functions of the operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 are given by  @xcite @xmath12 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : corr ] ) @xmath13 is the damping constant ( determined by the coupling between the oscillator and the bath ) , @xmath14 is a real parameter , which reduces to the mean number of thermal photons when the bath is not squeezed , and @xmath15 is the squeezing complex parameter ( @xmath16 ) satisfying the relation @xmath17 the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 measure the strength of the correlations of the bath degrees of freedom : for @xmath18 the squeezing is maximum , whereas for @xmath19 the reservoir reduces to the customary thermal one .    from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tothami])([eq : corr ] ) one can derive the following master equation for the reduced density matrix of the field mode in the interaction picture @xcite @xmath20 + \\gamma(n+1)(2a\\hat{\\rho } a^{\\dagger}-a^{\\dagger } a\\hat{\\rho}-\\hat{\\rho } a^{\\dagger } a ) \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\mbox { } + \\gamma n(2a^{\\dagger}\\hat{\\rho } a - aa^{\\dagger}\\hat{\\rho}-\\hat{\\rho } aa^{\\dagger } ) \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\mbox { } - \\gamma m(2a^{\\dagger}\\hat{\\rho } a^{\\dagger}-a^{\\dagger } a^{\\dagger}\\hat{\\rho}-\\hat{\\rho } a^{\\dagger } a^{\\dagger } ) \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\mbox { } -\\gamma m^{\\ast}(2a\\hat{\\rho } a - aa\\hat{\\rho}-\\hat{\\rho } aa)\\;. \\label{eq : meq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eq .",
    "( [ eq : meq ] ) is numerically solved in the next section .",
    "the results are shown in terms of the @xmath21-function @xmath22 which is the ( positive definite ) probability density for the antinormally ordered moments of the annihilation and creation operators , and in terms of the wigner function , which is defined by @xmath23    using standard methods @xcite , it is possible to convert the master equation  ( [ eq : meq ] ) into the fokker - planck type equation for the @xmath21-function @xmath24 \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\mbox { } + \\gamma\\left({{\\partial}\\over{\\partial\\alpha } } \\alpha+{{\\partial}\\over{\\partial\\alpha^{\\ast}}}\\alpha^{\\ast}\\right)q + 2\\gamma(n+1){{\\partial^2q}\\over{\\partial\\alpha\\partial\\alpha^{\\ast } } } \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\mbox { } + \\gamma m{{\\partial^2q}\\over{\\partial\\alpha^2 } } + \\gamma m^{\\ast}{{\\partial^2q}\\over{\\partial{\\alpha^{\\ast}}^2}}\\;. \\label{eq : fp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eq .",
    "( [ eq : fp ] ) has been solved for @xmath25 @xcite and for @xmath26 @xcite . for @xmath27 and @xmath15 both nonvanishing , however , an analytic solution is not available , whereas numerical integration has to be carried out carefully , because of computation instabilities @xcite .    in absence of dissipation",
    "an initial coherent state @xmath28 evolves towards the following superposition of coherent states at @xmath29 @xmath30 the @xmath21-function of the @xmath31 coherent state is the gaussian @xmath32 whereas for @xmath33 it approximatively corresponds to two gaussian peaks in the complex plane centered at @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the two peaks are macroscopically distinguishable  for @xmath36 .",
    "the evolution is periodic with period @xmath37 . in presence of dissipation the state at times",
    "@xmath38 is no longer pure , and a superposition of states corresponds to a quasi - superposition  mixed state , with interfering features still surviving .",
    "we will look for signatures of such states from peaks in the complex plane approximately separated by a distance @xmath39 , reminiscent of the state ( [ eq : yusto ] ) .",
    "we have studied the time evolution of the density matrix by integrating numerically the master equation ( [ eq : meq ] ) for truncated hilbert space dimension @xmath40 ( typically a power of 2 , in order to take advantage of fast fourier transform algorithm for reconstructing the @xmath21-function and the wigner function ) .",
    "the integration time - step has to be carefully tuned as a function of @xmath27 and @xmath34 ( here typically @xmath41 for a standard fourth - order runge - kutta routine ) .",
    "numerical accuracy is checked through normalization of @xmath42 , @xmath21 and @xmath43 , positivity of @xmath21 , and reality of the diagonal elements of @xmath42 . as a test",
    ", the results from analytical solutions for @xmath44 @xcite and for @xmath25 @xcite have been recovered up to the seventh digit .    in fig .",
    "[ fg : sque ] the @xmath21-function from the master equation ( [ eq : meq ] ) for maximally squeezed bath [ @xmath45 is given for @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and squeezing phase @xmath48 . at @xmath49 [ well before @xmath50 , namely before the creation time of the state ( [ eq : yusto ] ) in the undamped case ] two peaks are clearly visible in the structure of the @xmath21-function .",
    "this result can be compared with that of daniel and milburn @xcite at the same time , but in absence of squeezing .",
    "the two peaks are almost symmetrical with respect to the origin of the phase space .",
    "of course , due to dissipation , they are not strictly coherent , but they are still visible , even for subsequent times .    in fig .",
    "[ fg : term ] the effect of a purely thermal bath on the generation of the superposition state is shown for comparison with fig .",
    "[ fg : sque ] for the same values of the parameters . in this case",
    "there are no peaks in the @xmath21-function , which now exhibits a classical behaviour @xcite : this is the usual effect of dissipation @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fg : wign ] we show for completeness the time evolution of the wigner function at the same times as in fig .  [",
    "fg : sque ] : the two peaks still show up , but now some interference features arise between the two component states , as expected .",
    "we have also considered the case in which the phase of the complex squeezing parameter @xmath15 is chosen as @xmath51 , namely the squeezing direction of the phase sensitive bath is rotated of @xmath52 with respect to the case @xmath48@xcite : the creation of two peaks is still visible and their distance is approximately the same as in fig .",
    "[ fg : sque ] , but the line connecting them is now rotated of about @xmath52 , in agreement with the phase of @xmath15 .    the effect is further confirmed by the behaviour of the quadrature distributions @xmath53 , defined by @xmath54 with @xmath55 the probability @xmath53 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fg : marg ] at @xmath49 for @xmath56 and @xmath57 . for @xmath57along the direction which joins the two peaks of the wigner function ",
    "the probability @xmath53 exhibits two peaks resulting from marginal integration in the complex plane . on the other hand , along the orthogonal direction at @xmath56 ,",
    "a pattern reminiscent of interference in phase space@xcite between the two originally coherent components is visible .",
    "we have also computed the degree of mixing @xmath58 : its behaviour shows a rapid increase with time , achieving the asymptotic value @xmath59 .",
    "thus , the above coherence features still survive notwithstanding the large mixing .",
    "notice that , however , this happens only for the two - peak state , whereas there is no reminiscence of the symmetrical superposition of three coherent states which arises at @xmath60 in absence of dissipation .",
    "as regards the other parameters , the overall scenario is not affected by changing the phase of the initial coherent field @xmath61 , whereas increasing the modulus of @xmath61 deteriorates the formation of the two peaks . on the other hand , slightly increasing @xmath27 or @xmath14 ( still for a maximally squeezed bath ) , does not appreciably improve the visibility of the peaks .",
    "we have considered the anharmonic oscillator interacting with a squeezed bath . the dissipative kerr effect models a coherent state propagating into a nonlinear medium , as , for example , into an optical fiber .",
    "the squeezing has been considered in order to have the production of coherent effects in presence of dissipation . differently from the previous works @xcite and @xcite , our model treats all effects ( nonlinearity , dissipation and squeezing ) contextually .",
    "we have shown that squeezing the fluctuations of the bath improves the generation of quasi - superposition  states , which are completely forbidden in presence of a heat bath .",
    "our results are in agreement with those of kennedy and walls @xcite and of buek , kim and gantsog @xcite and complete them : a squeezed bath not only is able to preserve a macroscopic quantum superposition , but also allows its generation in presence of nonlinear interactions .",
    "the physical meaning of a squeezed bath is not completely understood in the present context : a suitable feedback mechanism could be envisaged that supports an _ ad hoc _ phase sensitive interaction , which amplifies or attenuates fluctuations , depending on the quadrature @xcite .    in conclusion , some comments regarding the direction of squeezing in the bath are in order . despite the squeezing direction does not affects the generation of quasi - superposition states , the survival time of coherence is naturally increased only for squeezing in the direction orthogonal to the line that joins the component states . on the other hand , the kerr effect rotates the @xmath21-function in the complex plane , thus making squeezing less efficient in the overall evolution .",
    "this suggests that an ideal bath should be squeezed isotropically in the plane , depending on the phase of the state itself .",
    "it is possible to write a master equation for such an isotropically squeezed bath : numerical results on these lines will be the object of a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
