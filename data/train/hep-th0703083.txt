    "it is believed that in spite of the recent potential importance of magnetic monopoles@xcite,@xcite,@xcite and dyons @xcite towards the quark confinement problem @xcite of quantum choromodynamics , possible magnetic condensation of vacuum @xcite , cp - violation @xcite , their role as catalyst in proton decay @xcite and the current grand unified theories @xcite , the formalism necessary to describe them has been clumsy and manifestly non - covariant .",
    "keeping in view the potential importance of monopoles and the results of witten @xcite that monopoles are necessarily dyons , we @xcite have also constructed a self - consistent co - variant theory of generalized electromagnetic fields associated with dyons each carrying the generalized charge as complex quantity with its real and imaginary part as electric and magnetic constituents . on the other hand quaternions",
    "were invented by hamilton @xcite to extend the theory of complex numbers to three dimensions .",
    "maxwell s equations of electromagnetism were rewritten in terms of quaternions @xcite .",
    "finklestein et al @xcite developed the quaternionic quantum mechanics and adler @xcite described the theory of the algebraic structure of quantum choromodynamics for strong interactions .",
    "various aspects of quaternions are discussed by morita @xcite towards the kinematical structure of poincare gauge theory and the left - right weinberg - salam theory of quantum choromodynamics .",
    "we have also studied @xcite the quaternionic formulation for generalized field equations of dyons in unique , simpler and compact notations .",
    "quaternion non - abelian gauge theory has also been consistently discussed @xcite to maintain the structural symmetry between the theory of linear gravity and electromagnetism .",
    "it is also shown that quaternion formalism characterises the abelian and non - abelian gauge structures @xcite of dyons in terms of real and imaginary constituents of quaternion basis elements .",
    "altenatively , kravchenko @xcite and his coworkers have consistently analysed the maxwell s equations for time - dependent electromagnetic fields in homogeneous ( isotropic ) and chiral medium . extending this ,",
    "we @xcite have also derived the generalised maxwells - dirac equation in the homogenous ( isotropic ) medium .",
    "it has been shown that the field equations of dyons also remains invariant under the duality transformations in isotropic homogeneous medium and the equation of motion reproduces the rotationally symmetric gauge invariant angular momentum of dyons . in order to extend the theory of monopoles and dyons in isotropic medium and consequently the relevance of quaternion formalism of dyons , in the present paper",
    "we have undertaken the study of the quaternion analysis of time dependent maxwell s equations in presence of electric and magnetic charges and the solution for the classical problem of moving sources are obtained in unique , simpler and consistent manner .",
    "quaternion forms of potential current , field equation and equation of motion are developed in compact manner and it is imphasized that the quantum equations in terms of quaternions are invariant under quaternion , lorentz and duality transformations .",
    "it has also been discussed that the quaternion analyticity of dyons in isotropic medium reproduces the results of kravchenko @xcite in the absence of magnetic monopole and accordingly this theory can be described symmetrically for pure monopole in the absence of electric charge or vice versa .",
    "assuming the existence of magnetic monopoles , we may write the following form @xcite of symmetric generalized maxwell - dirac differential equations @xcite in free space in si units @xmath2@xmath3 as ;    @xmath4    where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are respectively the electric and magnetic charge densities while @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the corresponding current densities , @xmath9 is electric induction vector , @xmath10 is electric field , @xmath11 is magnetic induction vector and @xmath12 is magnetic field .",
