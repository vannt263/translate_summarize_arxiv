    "neutrino oscillation experiments are powerful probes of neutrino masses ( see ) . at present three types of neutrino oscillation experiments",
    "have obtained positive results : solar and atmospheric experiments and one short - baseline experiment .",
    "all solar neutrino experiments ( homestake @xcite , kamiokande @xcite , gallex @xcite , sage @xcite , super - kamiokande @xcite ) have found a deficit in the flux of electron neutrinos on earth with respect to the standard solar model prediction @xcite , which constitutes an indication in favor of oscillations of electron neutrinos into other states .",
    "although no direct proof of these oscillations exist at present , there is a convincing evidence that the deficit of solar @xmath3 s is due to neutrino physics , of which neutrino oscillations is the simplest and most natural phenomenon .",
    "hopefully , the issue will be definitively settled in a few years by the new generation of neutrino oscillation experiments ( gno @xcite , sno @xcite , borexino @xcite , icarus @xcite and others @xcite ) .",
    "several atmospheric neutrino experiments ( kamiokande @xcite , imb @xcite , super - kamiokande @xcite , soudan 2 @xcite , macro @xcite ) have found an anomalous ratio of the events generated by muon and electron neutrinos and an anomalous angular dependence of the events generated by muon neutrinos .",
    "although so far the oscillation pattern has not been observed , this is considered as an evidence in favor of oscillations of muon neutrinos into tau or sterile neutrinos .",
    "transitions of muon neutrinos into electron neutrinos are strongly disfavored by the bounds established by the long - baseline @xmath4 disappearance experiments chooz @xcite and palo verde @xcite and by the fact that super - kamiokande data do not show any anomalous angular dependence of the events generated by atmospheric electron neutrinos .",
    "the present data of the super - kamiokande @xcite and macro @xcite disfavor pure transitions of atmospheric muon neutrinos into sterile states .",
    "there are good chances that the issue will be clarified in a definite way in the near future by long - baseline experiments with muon neutrino beams ( k2k @xcite , minos @xcite , opera @xcite , icarus @xcite ) and by new atmospheric neutrino experiments ( monolith @xcite and others @xcite ) .",
    "the k2k experiment have already obtained some preliminary indication of a possible transition of muon neutrinos into other states @xcite .",
    "the third evidence in favor of neutrino oscillations has been found in the short - baseline lsnd experiment @xcite , where an excess of @xmath5 events have been observed .",
    "if interpreted in terms of @xmath6 neutrino oscillations , this excess corresponds to an oscillation probability of @xmath7 .",
    "this result has not been confirmed by other experiments ( many other less sensitive short - baseline experiments have not found any signal of neutrino oscillations ; the strongest bounds have been obtained in the bugey @xcite , cdhs @xcite , ccfr @xcite , bnl - e776 @xcite , karmen @xcite , chorus @xcite , nomad @xcite experiments ) , but it is very interesting and important , because it is the only existing evidence of neutrino flavor transition from one state to another and because such transitions could be explored with high accuracy in future short - baseline experiments . in a few years the miniboone experiment @xcite will check the lsnd signal in terms of neutrino oscillations .",
    "it is well known ( see @xcite ) that the three indications in favor of neutrino oscillations need at least three different neutrino mass - squared differences ( @xmath8 s ) , arranged in the hierarchical order @xmath9 .",
    "this means that at least four massive neutrinos must exist .",
    "here we consider the minimal case of four massive neutrinos , that has been considered recently by many authors ( see and references therein ) , whose flavor basis is constituted by the standard active neutrinos @xmath3 , @xmath2 , @xmath10 , and a sterile neutrino @xmath11 .",
    "figure  [ 4schemes ] shows the six possible four - neutrino schemes that can accommodate the observed hierarchy of @xmath8 s .",
    "these six schemes are divided in two classes : 3 + 1 and 2 + 2 . in the 3 + 1 schemes",
    "there is a group of three neutrino masses separated from an isolated mass by the lsnd gap of the order of 1 ev , such that the largest mass - squared difference , @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 are neutrino masses , with @xmath16 ) , generates the oscillations observed in the lsnd experiment . in the 2 + 2 schemes there are two couples of close mass eigenstates separated by the lsnd gap .",
    "the numbering of the mass eigenvalues in fig .",
    "[ 4schemes ] is conveniently chosen in order to have always solar neutrino oscillations generated by @xmath17 and short - baseline ( sbl ) oscillations generated by @xmath18 ( we have also @xmath19 in 3 + 1 schemes and @xmath20 in 2 + 2 schemes ) . in 3 + 1 schemes",
    "atmospheric neutrino oscillations are generated by @xmath21 , whereas in 2 + 2 schemes they are generated by @xmath22 .",
    "it has been shown that in the framework of four - neutrino mixing the 3 + 1 schemes are disfavored by the experimental data , with respect to the 2 + 2 schemes @xcite . however , in a recent paper barger , kayser , learned , weiler and whisnant @xcite noticed that the new 99% cl allowed region obtained recently in the lsnd experiment and presented at the neutrino 2000 conference allows the existence 3 + 1 schemes ( see also @xcite ) in four small regions of the amplitude @xmath23 of @xmath24 and @xmath6 oscillations ( @xmath23 is equivalent to the usual @xmath25 in the two - generation case ) .",

    "such a scheme is attractive because it represents a perturbation of the standard three - neutrino mixing in which a mass eigenstate is added , that mixes mainly with the new sterile neutrino @xmath11 and very weakly with the standard active neutrinos @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath10 . in this case , the usual phenomenology of three - neutrino mixing in solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillation experiments is practically unchanged . the atmospheric neutrino anomaly would be explained by dominant @xmath0 transitions , with possible sub - dominant @xmath32 transitions constrained by the chooz bound .",
    "the solar neutrino problem would be explained by an approximately equal mixture of @xmath33 and @xmath1 transitions .    here , we consider another possibility that , as we will see , predicts relative large @xmath0 and @xmath1 transitions in short - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments , that could be observed in the near future .",
