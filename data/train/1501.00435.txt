    "the central assumption of general relativity is the strong equivalence principle ( henceforward referred to equivalence principle or ep)@xcite : a freely falling frame is indistinguishable locally from an inertial frame with a minkowski metric .",
    "viceversa , stationary frames in gravitational fields are indistinguishable from accelerating frames , represented in minkowski space by coordinate systems with curvature .",
    "the strong ep implies that _ all _ laws of physics respect this invariance .",
    "this implies that all laws of physics have to be written covariantly with respect to non - inertial transformations , and that gravitational fields have to be described in terms of a curved spacetime , in which _ all _ metrics are warped .    while the ep leads to an elegant picture of _ classical _ physical laws , extending it to the structure of quantum field theory , which reconciled quantum mechanics in terms of vectors in hilbert space evolving linearly under the action of unitary operators , @xmath0 |\\psi>$ ] , and observables as hermitian operators ( @xmath1 ) defined on this space .",
    "`` quantum field theory '' refers to the extension of this framework to fields , valued over each point in spacetime .",
    "as we argue toward the end of the introduction , this definition is reductive since hermiticity , linearity and unitarity are only applicable for _ closed _ quantum systems .",
    "however , a rigorous definition of quantum mechanics without this constraint is currently lacking ( the reformulation in terms of sum - over - paths and partition functions comes closest to to such a rigorous definition ) , so weather the `` modification of quantum mechanics '' discussed this work is really a modification of quantum mechanics is a matter of opinion and semantics ] with _ special _",
    "relativity @xcite has proven very difficult , with both technical issues , such as non - renormalizeability of gravity as a field theory @xcite , and conceptual paradoxes , such as the black hole information problem @xcite , being highly controversial after decades of study .",
    "this should not surprise us : the mere fact that @xcite , a detector in curved space , whether due to acceleration ( usually called the unruh effect ) or a gravitational field ( usually called hawking radiation ) , sees a finite temperature bath makes combining background independence with quantum mechanics fundamentally problematic , because even infinitesimal non - inertial deformations put the vacuum in another superselection sector with a different entropy content .",
    "note that this signals an ambiguity of the semiclassical limit of qft as well as gravity : haag s theorem @xcite ensures that even an infinitesimal coordinate deformation @xcite will send the vacuum of the theory into a unitarily inequivalent orthogonal state @xcite , one which is indistinguishable from a thermal mixed state which can not be reached by quantum evolution . for normal qft",
    "this ambiguity is irrelevant as this unitary inequivalence can be reabsorbed into field - strength renormalization , but for a theory of gravity such a renormalization would inevitably modify observable asymptotic states .",
    "the universal nature of the `` fragility '' of quantum field theory to deformations is illustrated by the fact that interactions and the unruh effect are deeply connected : _ dynamically _ the unruh effect can be understood , in an inertial frame , in terms of qft interactions ( bremstrahlung - like processes to leading order ) between a charged detector and the field provoking its acceleration @xcite . in this picture",
    "the different entropy content of the system can be understood in terms of the use of the semiclassical approximation and decoherence @xcite with respect to the zero entropy minkowski vacuum .",
    "this means , however , that an `` accelerated '' transformation will send the system into a different vacuum , a non - unitary transformation , as made evident by the different entropy content of this vacuum .",
    "a dynamical change in gravitational fields , however , needs to be unitary if gravity is to be a quantum theory as usually defined ( see footnote 1 ) . while a linearized gravitational fluctuation maintains ep ( in fact , is required by quantum consistency to do so @xcite ) , any vacuum backreaction should break it .",
    "quantitatively , this should manifest itself as an anomalous difference between the energy - momentum tensor defined from the effective action @xmath2 and the vertex function for the graviton @xmath3 ( fig . [ def ] panels ( a ) and ( b ) respectively ) .",
    "this , in fact , has long been seen explicitly in loop corrections of spin-2 theories @xcite , and even at the level for first quantization @xcite . note that lack of unitarity has nothing to do with energy conservation ( in an accelerated frame the hamiltonian has an explicit time dependence ) , but is dependent on the fact that quantum field theories are local and have infinitely many degrees of freedom . in a fundamental theory where",
    "degrees of freedom at the planck scale are countable , non - inertial transformations should also be unitary , and it is not clear whether the unruh effect persists in such models @xcite . if it does not , however , the existence within such theories of a semiclassical limit of a quantum field theory living on a manifold is doubtful because of the connection of the unruh effect to qft in minkowski space @xcite .",
    "let us try to interpret what this incompatibility means in a more physical way . in classical physics ,",
    "while non - inertial frames are distinguishable from inertial ones , dynamically the difference can be parametrized by fictitious forces ( coriolis , centrifugal and others , represented by parallel transport formalisms : christoffel symbols and so on ) .",
    "the ep implies that    * any non - gravitational consequences of choosing a non - inertial frame can be parametrized by such a formalism centered around parallel transport * choosing a non - inertial frame in and of itself can not impact the gravitational dynamics , which is represented by the geometry of space and not the local metric choice .",
    "if this is to be a semiclassical limit of a quantum theory , either the role of the horizon implies a general breaking of unitarity or the gravitational forces can not be fully encoded this way : in minkowski space , and _ only _ in minkowski space , any correlations at superhorizon distances will cancel out when antiparticles and particles are taken into account @xcite and so we can say that the bulk and the horizon are fully decoupled .",
    "the violation of unitarity implicit in the unruh effect can be interpreted @xcite as the tracing over of degrees of freedom lying beyond a rindler horizon .",
    "if this evolution is to be unitary , this tracing over can only be an approximation , and hence an observer could in principle reconstruct states appearing beyond the horizon exactly ( this reasoning applied to a black hole geometry is the essential issue behind the so - called black - hole information paradox @xcite ) . by definition",
    "such a horizon is not a `` true '' horizon but an apparent one , which ceases being a horizon when the right observable is measured .",
    "since horizons encode information on the curvature of geometry @xcite ( including infinitesimal perturbations @xcite ) , and the strong ep implies gravity to be geometric , the ep requires _ no _ observable can be constructed sensitive to degrees of freedom beyond the horizon ( the horizon must indeed be a `` true '' one ) and hence the tracing over needs to be _",
    "exact_. this suggests _ either _ the equivalence principle , _ or _",
    "quantum mechanics _ or _ at least observer - specific unitarity have to be abandoned .",
    "aesthetic and consistency grounds make for skepticism of the second alternative , which nevertheless has some following ( see e.g. @xcite ) ; most of the practitioners of the field tend to prefer the first alternative , sometimes couching it in arguments such as those in @xcite",
    ". indeed , high precision empirical tests of the strong equivalence principle are not to at the level sufficient to test this alternative , which would require precision measurements of the difference highlighted in fig .",
    "[ def ] ( precise torsion experiments @xcite tend to test the weak version . to the author s knowledge the only direct tests that self - energy respects the ep are nordveldt effect measurements @xcite ) .",
    "given the historical role of the _ exact _ ep in the development of general relativity as geometric theory , however , it is tempting to discuss `` how much of quantum mechanics '' one has to abandon for the ep to hold _ at all orders _ , in @xmath4 and field coupling constants if not @xmath5 .      to impose",
    "the strong equivalence principle means making sure the two local detectors , instantaneously in two different ( not necessarily inertial ) coordinate systems will obtain the same values for _ all observables _ once the non - inertial effects ( the equivalent of the pseudo - frces in the classical description ) are `` properly '' accounted for .",
    "the crucial issue is to understand the meaning of this `` properly '' within a quantum field theory : in the sum - over - paths picture , it means adding the imaginary _ boundary term _ to the action @xcite , so what appears as a unitary quantum evolution to one observer will appear as a partially or fully decohered `` thermal '' evolution to the other .",
    "this means that covariance with respect to non inertial transformations implies it should be possible to substitute a `` thermal '' ensemble for a quantum one by going to a different coordinate system .",
    "this is _ not _ incompatible with standard quantum mechanics : horizons make any quantum system _ open _ ( the degrees of freedom outside the horizon have to be traced over ) , and open quantum systems have been studied for decades @xcite .",
    "objects such as partition functions , correlators and density matrices , remain well - defined .",
    "since curvature of space is necessarily linked to the appearance of a causally connected horizon @xcite , this is a promising approach for encoding the equivalence principle at the level of an effective field theory ( eft ) .",
    "as we will show , holography @xcite follows naturally as a consequence . while we are not aware of such an eft approach being proposed before , a similar argument was made in @xcite at the _ classical _ level .",
    "furthermore , given the definition of local geometry in terms of the horizon @xcite , our approach is compatible with the thermal time hypothesis @xcite / the wootters - page decoherence time picture @xcite , and the mathematical formalism is similar to that described in section iiic of @xcite and references therein .",
    "in addition , there is a deep mathematical analogy between the physics advocated here and the gribov horizon picture in nonabelian gauge theores @xcite .",
    "we shall proceed in the feynman sum - over - paths picture @xcite and define our eft at the level of the partition function . given",

    "one can then impose constrains that `` all detectors '' at the same point in spacetime in non - inertial reference frames will measure the same correlation functions .",

    "the necessity of the surface term @xmath33 @xcite and the temperature @xcite have long been known , but the discussion here gives them an interpretation rooted in the equivalence principle .",

    "it should be noted that , due to the weinberg - witten theorem , a self - consistent spin-2 theory will exhibit the equivalence principle at tree level @xcite ] . since the bulk in gauge / gravity setups always includes spin-2 fields , and is thought to be a limit of a truly quantum background - independent theory ( `` m - theory '' ) , it is not surprising holography should arise and , with the additional constraints , lead to an equation of the type of eq .",

    "more subtly , consider the infalling observer calculation described in section vii of @xcite .",
    "the authors argue that an infalling observer s detection of hawking radiation is suppressed by the finite size of the locally available detector with respect to the characteristic frequency of hawking s radiation .",
    "provided the equivalence principle holds semiclassically , this conclusion is inevitable , since otherwise the infalling observer would have a local measurement at their disposal which would tell them they are in fact infalling rather than in an inertial frame .",

    "this assumption is _ not _ obviously related to the equivalence principle , and does _ not _ hold for general field theories : obvious counter examples are conformally invariant theories ( such as @xmath64 sym @xcite ) or alternatively massless @xmath65 theory . in a world",

    "in this work , we have _ not _ outlined a theory of quantum gravity .",
    "the geometry that defines @xmath66 and @xmath67 is classical , with quantum theories living on it . in the semiclassical limit",

    "this evolution is also the semiclassical leading term of a lindblad - type equation @xcite , with the super - horizon degrees of freedom traced over instantaneously , consistently with the fact that to leading order in @xmath71 , the horizon is determined `` instantaneously '' ( in the detectors comoving frame ) from the rayachaduri equation @xcite and @xmath72 of the bulk fields .",
    "rather , we have written down a recipe for constructing an eft respecting covariance with respect to non - inertial transformations , and hence have paved the way to incorporating the equivalence principle in an effective theory expansion .",
    "equation [ zdef ] is classical in gravity and leading order in @xmath5 , but it is in arbitrary order in @xmath4 and eft coupling constants . in a regime where a semiclassical eft is a good approximation ,",

    "physically they address the _ quantum process _ of crossing the horizon , something that happens instantaneously up to @xmath74 .",

    "hence , fundamentally as well as practically , any hope for testing these ideas should focus on _ weak _ fields and accelerations with respect to the relevant power of @xmath5 .",
    "for instance , gravitational waves in this approach look very different from the usual approaches , centered around `` graviton '' quantization .",

    "other mechanisms , where primordial waves are generated by reaction with matter , however , also exist , through suppressed by powers of @xmath76 , analogously to black hole evaporation and the dissipation of sound in a viscous medium@xcite , on a time - scale of @xmath77 .",
    "this effect can not be captured by perturbation expansions , since the perturbative decay amplitude of a graviton to _ any _ number of photons is zero @xcite , but can be readily understood as the kind of semiclassical non - perturbative effect background independence requires for arbitrary weak perturbations .",
    "this implies that gravitational waves , of arbitrarily small amplitudes , must be thought of as collective `` semiclassical '' excitations .",
    "more quantitative calculations in this direction can be done by the linearized horizon formalism described in @xcite .",
    "more generally , the strong equivalence principle can be directly experimentally probed to a level necessary to test if it applies beyond linearized gr .",
    "in addition to the lunar ranging experiments mentioned earlier @xcite qed setups in an accelerated frame could lead to regimes where horizon effects appear .",
    "for example , the @xmath78 interference detected in @xcite should appear _ exactly _ in an accelerating frame , and disappear , up to tidal forces , in a freely falling frame ( in orbit , for example ) .",
    "while this is obvious in the first quantization limit , since wavenumber shift@xmath79 momentum change @xmath79 force @xmath80 time , in the field theory limit , where back - reaction with the unruh effect is non - negligible , the applicability of the equivalence principle could yield quantifiable predictions .",
    "formalisms such as @xcite for qfts and @xcite for quantum mechanics can be used to calculate observables under the assumption that full unitarity is maintained in the presence of gravitational fields . the general reasoning contained in this paper",
    "will lead to an expectation that decoherence will happen at a rate comparable to the ratio of the characteristic size of the system ( the minimum of the wave - number of the system s constituents and the system s charge radius ) to the distance from the horizon in the systems comoving frame .",
    "this is natural scale , defining relativistic `` locality '' in a quantum setting .",
    "given the recent work with ultra - powerful lasers @xcite , perhaps quantitative tests of this type will become possible in the coming decades ) .",
    "finally , it should be noted that a cosmological formulation of the conjecture presented here could provide a foundation to the approach in @xcite , given the analogy of the action in @xcite with eq .",
    "furthermore , a cosmological formulation with _ conserved charges _ in addition to @xmath81 , and hence a bulk - boundary _ chemical potential _ augmenting temperature in eq .",
    "[ zdef ] will naturally lead to a net conserved charge asymmetry in the bulk , in a manner similar to @xcite .",

    "+ in non - abelian gauge theories , gauge choice is not possible when non - perturbative field fluctuations are taken into account in the parth integral , but `` equivalent '' gauge choices are not connected by continuus deformations .",
    "such equivalent gauge choices are separated by a horizon in field strength @xmath82 . as the authors of the review quoted above show",
    ", one can approximate qualitative features of non - perturbative qcd , like confinement , by limiting the functional integral of the fields to modes below this horizon .",
    "while physically gauge symmetry is very different from general relativity ( in gauge theory `` background independence '' is defined in an internal space , and observables are gauge - invariant . in general relativity",
    "it is defined in physical space , and observables are gauge - dependent ) , mathematically both are based on diffeomorphism invariance ( in internal and physical space respectively ) , hence the equivalent of horizons , in internal space , must appear and have a role in gauge theory .",
    "the mathematical consequences of both horizons in @xmath82 and horizons in spacetime are equivalent : the appearance of boundary terms in the effective lagrangian .",
    "physically , these horizons do very different things ; in gr , the horizon breaks unitarity and represents the unobservability of certain degrees of freedom . in non - abelian gauge theory it does not affect unitarity since it separates gauge - equivalent regions , but it introduces non - perturbative effects into quark and gluon propagators , and might ultimately be responsible for confinement . while we are not even close to understanding the full consequences of this , the idea that the confinement phase transition and the physics of black holes are deeply analogous is thus natural .",
