    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite has produced a revolution in both the volume and quality of spectroscopic data available for quasars . the data release 5 ( dr5 ) @xcite and legacy data release 7 ( dr7 ) @xcite with their associated quasar catalogues ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) provide intermediate resolution ( @xmath11@xmath122000 ) , moderate signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) ( snr@xmath1215 per 69pixel ) , spectra of unprecedented homogeneity , covering essentially the entire ",
    "wavelength region ( @xmath5=38009180 ) .",
    "the quality of the schneider et al .",
    "quasar catalogues is truly impressive , with errors in redshift identification reduced to the 0.01 per cent level and individual redshift estimates , resulting primarily from the sdss spectroscopic pipeline ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and the sdss dr7 website ) , are accurate to of order @xmath0@xmath120.002 .",
    "the publication of even individual quasar redshifts , based on moderate resolution spectra , to such accuracy was a significant achievement prior to the mid-1990s , further highlighting the advance represented by the sdss .    notwithstanding the quality of the sdss quasar spectra and the associated redshift estimates , important scientific investigations , including the clustering of quasars themselves ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , the cross - correlation of quasars and other object populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , the origin and properties of associated absorbers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) benefit significantly both from reduced systematics in redshift determinations and the reliable assignment of redshift uncertainties for individual quasars .",
    "in this paper we present the determination of new redshifts and associated error estimates for more than 89500 quasars from the sdss dr6 @xcite .",
    "our redshift determinations suffer from much smaller systematic effects compared to the default values from the sdss spectroscopic pipeline .",
    "specifically , systematics are reduced by more than an order of magnitude to 1.0@xmath910@xmath8 in @xmath13/(1+@xmath14 ) per unit redshift , or , equivalently , 30per unit redshift/(1+@xmath14 ) , whereas researchers studying galaxies conventionally specify uncertainties in kilometres per second .",
    "the improvements possible in redshift determination made possible by the sdss spectra are such that the ` kilometres per second ' parameterisation is increasingly attractive and we specify the main results using both schemes . ] .",
    "a detailed comparison of redshifts derived from h&k absorption , @xmath63727,3729 emission , @xmath64960,5008 emission and cross - correlation with a new quasar template spectrum , provides greatly improved error estimates for individual quasar redshifts .",
    "the error estimates incorporate both the uncertainties resulting from the properties of the sdss spectra , quantified using the very large number of multiple spectra present in the sdss , and the intrinsic quasar - to - quasar dispersion .",
    "the resulting catalogue will allow significant advances in many studies that rely on the determination of systemic quasar redshifts with small systematics and well - determined uncertainties .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the quasar sample , before the features of the quasar redshifts available from the sdss spectroscopic pipeline are illustrated in section 3 .",
    "section 4 includes a description of the procedures involved in generating a master quasar template for the cross - correlation redshift estimates .",
    "section 5 then describes the procedures employed to provide the new redshift estimates for the sdss quasars .",
    "an assessment of the consistency of the different redshift estimates is given in section 6 and redshift estimates , based on different rest - frame wavelength regions , are placed onto the same ` systemic ' reference system .",
    "a critical assessment of the internal and external reliability of the new quasar redshifts is presented at this point .",
    "twenty - one centimetre radio observations of the majority of the sdss quasars are available from the faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimetres ( first , * ? ? ?",
    "section 7 contains a description showing how the new redshift estimation scheme allows spectral energy distribution ( sed ) dependent composite spectra ( for first - detected quasars in this case ) to be constructed , producing significantly improved redshifts .",
    "the resulting redshift catalogue , including well - determined error estimates for each quasar , is described in section 8 . a short discussion , including consideration of the origin of the differences with published redshifts and an independent test of the new redshifts follows in section 9 .",
    "the paper concludes with a brief summary of the conclusions as section 10 .",
    "we adopt the same convention as employed in the sdss and use vacuum wavelengths throughout the paper .",
    "absolute magnitudes are calculated in a cosmology with @xmath15=70 , @xmath16=0.3 and @xmath17=0.7 .",
    "the quasar sample consists of 91665 objects , including 77392 quasars in the @xcite dr5 catalogue that are retained in the later dr7 quasar catalogue of @xcite .",
    "a further 13081 objects are quasars , present in the additional dr6 spectroscopic plates , identified by one of us ( pch ) using a similar prescription to that employed by @xcite , all of which are present in the @xcite catalogue .",
    "an additional 1192 objects , which do not satisfy one , or both , of the emission line velocity width or absolute magnitude criterion imposed by @xcite , are also included .",
    "while formally failing the ` quasar ' definition of schneider et al.s dr5 and dr7 compilations the objects are essentially all luminous active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "none of the results in the paper depend on the exact definition of the ` quasar'-sample used .",
    "the spectra were all processed through the sky - residual subtraction scheme of @xcite , resulting in significantly improved snr at wavelengths @xmath5@xmath187200 .",
    "the snr improvement allows the important quasar rest - frame wavelength regions containing the @xmath52799 and @xmath51908 emission lines , to contribute to the cross - correlation redshift determinations ( section [ sec : cc_calc ] ) to much higher redshifts than is possible using the original sdss spectra .",
    "the sdss dr6 contains a very large number of objects for which multiple spectra are available . for our quasar sample",
    "there are @xmath39000 independent pairs of spectra .",
    "the catalogue of spectrum pairs allows the accurate determination of redshift reproducibility as a function of snr , redshift and cross - correlation amplitude and extensive use of the spectrum pairs is made to quantify the contribution of the sdss spectra themselves to the quasar redshift errors .",
    "the sdss spectroscopic pipeline ( spectro1d ) incorporates a sophisticated scheme@xmath19 for determining both the classification ( star , galaxy , quasar , ... ) of the spectra and the redshifts of extragalactic objects .",
    "cross - correlation redshift estimates are determined using the @xcite technique and a composite quasar template from @xcite .",
    "emission lines are identified via a wavelet transform technique and an independent redshift estimate is derived using the observed - frame wavelength emission line locations and reference rest - frame emission line wavelengths , the latter taken from the @xcite composite quasar spectrum .",
    "the reference wavelengths adopted from the quasar composite can differ from laboratory values due to the complex , often asymmetric , line profiles and apparent ` velocity shifts ' of the line centroids @xcite .",
    "the sdss database and the individual fits spectrum files contain extensive quantitative information on the determination and reliability of the different redshift estimates .",
    "however , the majority of researchers utilise the ` final'-redshift estimate z included in the sdss specobjall table , the individual fits spectrum file headers , or from the schneider et al . catalogues .",
    "if available , the cross - correlation redshift is adopted as the ` final ' redshift for the spectrum .",
    "some 88 per cent of the quasars possess redshifts derived from cross - correlation and more than a third of such objects also possess consistent emission line - based redshifts . a further 7 per cent of quasars , where no reliable cross - correlation redshift is available , possess redshifts derived from the emission lines .",
    "the remaining 5 per cent of quasars , including a large fraction of pathological objects and spectra of low snr , have redshifts derived via manual inspection of the spectra .",
    "independent spectrum classifications and redshift determinations , based on direct @xmath20-fitting of template spectra to the data , have been made at princeton using the specbs code .",
    "the redshift determination , essentially via cross - correlation , differs from the implementation employed in the spectro1d pipeline but the same composite quasar template from @xcite was used .",
    "[ sdss_prince ] shows a comparison of the sdss final - redshifts and princeton redshifts as a function of quasar redshift and @xmath21 have @xmath0=@xmath22 plotted as the y - axis .",
    "the choice of which estimate is used in the denominator is usually irrelevant given the scale of the plots . ] .",
    "the selection of the sub - sample of more than 70000 spectra is conservative in that only spectra with high - confidence sdss redshifts , where there is also no inconsistency between the cross - correlation and emission line redshift determinations , are used . the data in fig .",
    "[ sdss_prince ] should essentially represent an internal consistency check and the large differences between redshifts , extending to @xmath235@xmath910@xmath24 , or 1500 , are surprising .",
    "perhaps even more striking is the sequence of apparent discontinuities in the behaviour as a function of redshift .",
    "a second illustration of the extent of redshift - dependent systematics comes from comparing the redshift derived from the location of the @xmath62796,2803 emission in each quasar spectrum with the sdss redshift .",
    "[ sdss_mgii ] presents the data for more than 60000 spectra with snr@xmath110 emission line locations ( from the sdss spectroscopic pipeline ) .",
    "the rest - frame location of the emission line has been shown by many studies over the decades to be well - behaved and there is no reason to expect @xmath3500shifts over small redshift intervals , or , indeed , an apparent systematic 2@xmath910@xmath24 ( 600 ) change in the location of the emission with increasing redshift of the quasars .",
    "the systematic redshift differences show similar patterns over the redshift range common to both fig .",
    "[ sdss_prince ] and fig .",
    "[ sdss_mgii ] .",
    "although somewhat more complex to interpret ( section  [ sec : em_shifts ] ) , the equivalent plot for the emission , fig .  [ sdss_ciii ] , also shows strong systematic effects as a function of redshift . the form and substantial amplitude of the systematic and random differences in figs .",
    "[ sdss_prince][sdss_ciii ] led to the initiation of the investigation presented here .",
    "the generation of the high - snr quasar template to be used to calculate cross - correlation redshifts begins with a sample of quasars at low redshifts that possess emission line - determined redshifts .",
    "a somewhat more involved procedure is then necessary to incorporate additional quasars at higher redshifts into the master template . in this section",
    "the recipe for each element of the master template construction are outlined .",
    "the narrow forbidden emission lines of @xmath64960,5008 are prominent in many quasar spectra with redshifts @xmath14@xmath250.8 and a composite spectrum based on the combination of quasars with redshifts determined via the location of emission forms the starting point for the construction of the master quasar template .",
    "the @xmath319000 quasars with sdss redshifts @xmath14@xmath250.85 are searched for the presence of emission in a narrow wavelength interval ( @xmath3100 ) corresponding to the predicted rest - frame location calculated from the sdss redshift .",
    "a ` continuum ' is defined using a median filter of 21 pixels and @xmath64960,5008 emission then identified using a matched - filter detection scheme applied to a continuum - subtracted version of each spectrum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "emission is often broad and frequently exhibits strong asymmetries @xcite , the small filter - scale adopted for the detection is chosen with the aim of isolating narrow , well - defined , peaks that may be present .",
    "the filter template consists of two gaussian components of the same width , centred at 4960.30  and 5008.24 , with flux ratio 1:3 .",
    "emission features can be identified reliably via detections with relatively low snr , particularly given the restricted wavelength range searched in each spectrum .",
    "however , given the importance of establishing accurate redshifts as the first step in the construction of the composite quasar , the 8542 spectra possessing detections with snr@xmath18@xmath26 form the starting point for the template construction .",
    "the recipe used to combine spectra with specified redshifts into a composite is as follows :    * pixels falling within 6.0  of the strong night - sky lines at 5578.5  and 6301.7  are flagged * pixels without valid sdss data , determined from the sdss noise array provided for each spectrum , are flagged * spectra are shifted to the rest - frame , with the native 69`pixels ' of the original sdss spectra retained .",
    "the signal from each spectrum is placed onto the master rest - frame wavelength array using a ` nearest pixel'-scheme , thereby avoiding the need for any rebinning or interpolation=20 , less than a third of a pixel , in the extent of features in the resulting composite spectra . ]",
    "* spectra are normalised using a wavelength interval common to all spectra * spectra are median - filtered with a window of 61-pixels to define a ` continuum ' .",
    "spectrum pixels falling more than 4.5@xmath26 below the continuum , along with a grow - radius of two pixels , are flagged , effectively removing wavelengths affected by strong narrow absorption * the median value of all non - flagged pixels at each rest - frame wavelength is calculated ( a minimum of 100 spectra must contribute )    at this point a very high snr composite quasar spectrum is available , extending down to rest - frame wavelength @xmath5@xmath32300 .",
    "the emission moves beyond the red limit of the sdss spectra at @xmath14@xmath180.8 and it is necessary to use a cross - correlation scheme , employing a much greater wavelength range of the quasar spectrum , to allow the construction of the master template further into the rest - frame ultra - violet .      the cross - correlation algorithm is based on a straightforward spatial cross - correlation between an individual quasar spectrum and a high - snr template spectrum .",
    "the key elements of the cross - correlation calculation are i ) a conservative choice of the portions of the quasar spectrum to employ in the calculation , avoiding strong emission lines close to the edges of the observed spectrum , and ii ) application of an essentially identical ` window ' to both the individual quasar and template spectra prior to the cross - correlation calculation .    for each quasar spectrum , with its companion error - array , pixels are excluded from the cross - correlation calculation according to a sequence of rules / tests .",
    "the first and last valid pixels , where the sdss spectrum error - array is not set to 0 , define the limits of the accessible wavelength range . in the observed - frame :    * the first 25-pixels at each end are excluded * pixels within 6  of each of the strong night - sky emission lines at 5578.5  and 6301.5  are excluded * narrow absorption features are identified by examining a continuum - subtracted spectrum .",
    "the continuum is defined using a 61-pixel median filter .",
    "pixels that fall more than 4.5@xmath26 below the continuum are flagged and a grow - radius of 2-pixels then applied .",
    "thus , a single pixel exceeding the threshold results in the exclusion of 5-pixels .",
    "the quasar spectrum is then transformed to the rest - frame using the specified redshift estimate , @xmath27 initially but all the cross - correlation estimates are recalculated using an updated value of @xmath27 from the cross - correlation calculation itself .",

    "the fit is then refined , performing quadratic fits to narrower pixel intervals centred on the peak of the previous quadratic fit , with the final fit determined over an interval of @xmath34=@xmath35/5 .",
    "the output consists of a redshift estimate , @xmath37 , and a cross - correlation amplitude , @xmath38 , in the range 1@xmath7@xmath38@xmath71 , which parameterises the degree of similarity between the two spectra .",
    "extensive experimentation demonstrates that the requirement @xmath38@xmath10.2 results in an almost error - free catalogue of cross - correlation redshifts .",
    "however , it must be stressed that the use of such a low amplitude is only possible because of the extremely low occurrence of catastrophic redshift mis - identifications resulting from the sdss spectroscopic pipeline and the subsequent refinements of @xcite .      with the cross - correlation redshift determination procedure in place it is possible to utilise quasars with redshift @xmath14@xmath180.8 to extend the master template . to ensure that the template construction is not adversely affected by the inclusion of spectra with poor snr , or the presence of broad absorption line ( bal ) troughs , the full quasar sample ( section [ sec : samp ] )",

    "all spectra with @xmath38@xmath10.2 and redshifts , 0.8@xmath25@xmath14@xmath71.0 , are combined to produce a composite .",
    "then , the original and new composites are combined by taking the average , weighted by the relative number of spectra contributing at each wavelength .",
    "the effect is to determine redshifts for quasars using only the wavelength range where the initial ( lower - redshift ) composite is of high snr .",
    "the procedure is then repeated for intervals of @xmath13=0.2 up to redshift @xmath14=1.6 .",
    "table  [ tab : cc_construct ] summarises the number of spectra , median absolute magnitudes and wavelength coverage for all of the composites used to generate the final master template spectrum .",

    "[ fig : mg_ciii ] shows the ratio of the observed - frame centroids of ` ' and for quasars in the redshift interval 1.1@xmath25@xmath14@xmath252.2 , where both lines are present in the sdss spectra .",
    "the systematic trend of @xmath32@xmath910@xmath24 in the wavelength ratio as a function of quasar luminosity translates directly into a systematic in @xmath39/(1+@xmath14 ) where the emission line region contributes significantly to the cross - correlation signal .",
    "the luminosity - dependent change in the relative positions of the and emission lines presents a problem when considering the generation of the master quasar template .",
    "indeed , the large systematic means that care is needed when calculating redshifts for a population of quasars with a range of luminosities .",
    "consider the result of cross - correlating a quasar template with a quasar of high luminosity .",
    "the emission in the quasar is at slightly smaller rest - frame wavelength than in the template and the resulting redshift estimate will lie somewhere between redshift estimates based on the locations of the and lines alone . performing such cross - correlation redshift estimates for a sample of higher redshift quasars and then updating",
    "the template with their spectra will have the effect of biasing the profile / location of the emission line to smaller wavelengths .",
    "the effect is pernicious in that subsequent use of such a template to calculate redshifts for quasars where is not even visible , will produce biased values because of the systematic change in the profile / location of emission and other features in the template .",
    "similar , even larger , luminosity - dependent systematic trends are also present in the relative locations of the emission complex and the emission line .",

    "[ fig : comp_comp]b shows the excellent agreement between the composites at optical wavelengths where emission lines , including h@xmath41 and @xmath64960,5008 , dominate the redshift determinations ( either directly , via emission line locations , or , through the contribution of emission lines to the cross - correlation signal ) . in contrast , fig .",
    "[ fig : comp_comp]a , illustrates the significant difference in the location of the @xmath52799 emission line in the two composites . at the accuracy levels of interest , absolute wavelength ` centroids ' of broad emission lines in quasar spectra",
    "are dominated by the particular scheme used to define the associated ` continuum ' and the height above the continuum used to define the ` line ' .",
    "however , the centroid of the portion of the emission line above half the peak height is 1.2@xmath230.1  bluer in the hw - template compared to the @xcite template . the line centroid moves redward as increasingly large fractions of the line wings are included but at the half peak height level the hw - template line centroid is only 0.4@xmath42(@xmath345 ) redward of the rest - frame reference value of 2798.75 , derived from the components in the ratio 2:1 .    the strongest ` jump ' in the relation between the hw- and princeton - redshifts in fig .",
    "[ fig : hw_prince ] , at @xmath14@xmath32.2 , derives fundamentally from the large systematic trends in the ratio of to ` ' emission line locations as a function of quasar absolute magnitude ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mg_ciii ] ) .",
    "the origin of the effect is primarily the change in the ratio of @xmath51908 to @xmath51892 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rqrl_ciii ] for illustration in the context of first - detected quasars ) .",
    "a direct comparison of the hw - template and @xcite template is somewhat misleading because the hw - redshifts are derived only following the significant absolute magnitude dependent corrections .",
    "however , using any sensible definition of the emission line , the + blend is significantly bluer in the hw - template than in the @xcite composite , producing the increase in the hw - redshifts at @xmath14@xmath32.2 .",
    "the princeton redshifts then become progressively closer to the hw - redshifts as the emission line ( with its well - established increasing blue asymmetry at increasing quasar luminosity ) dominates the princeton determinations at higher redshifts .",
    "recall though , that the emission region does _ not _ contribute to the hw - redshifts , except in a very small percentage of quasars .",
    "the availability of the large sdss quasar catalogues have stimulated new investigations into the physical origin of associated absorbers , particularly those evident through the presence of and absorption ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a pre - requisite for such investigations is an estimate of the systemic quasar redshifts .",
    "given the large intrinsic variation in the properties of the emission line and the relative invariance of the emission line centroid , redshifts based on the location of the emission line are often employed in studies of both associated and absorbers in quasars with redshifts @xmath14@xmath72.1 .",
    "both and absorber catalogues are available from our investigation of absorber populations in sdss quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "strong narrow absorbers are flagged and ` removed ' from the quasar spectra prior to the calculation of the cross - correlation redshift determinations ( section  [ sec : temcon ] ) .",
    "the new hw - quasar redshifts are thus essentially independent of the presence of individual absorbers and a comparison of associated absorbers velocity distributions , using both sdss- and hw - redshifts , provides a powerful test of the redshift accuracy in an astrophysical context of considerable current interest .",

    "the differences in the distributions are striking , with the hw - redshift - based histogram showing a much higher peak at @xmath41@xmath30 and a greatly reduced population of positive @xmath41 values ( i.e. @xmath44@xmath18@xmath45 ) .",
    "the centroid of the @xmath41@xmath30 component shows no detectable shift over the entire redshift range of the quasars , 1.55@xmath25@xmath14@xmath253.5 .",

    "the differences between the sdss- and hw - redshifts at @xmath14@xmath252.1 are significantly smaller than for the quasars included in the absorber sample .",
    "however , similar behaviour is evident to that seen in the absorbers , the @xmath41@xmath30 peak is significantly better defined using the hw - redshifts and the population of redshifted absorbers with positive @xmath41 greatly reduced .",
    "a more detailed consideration of the distribution of the absorber redshifts leads to an improved parameterisation of the various constituent absorber populations @xcite .",
    "to summarise , the distributions of the and associated absorber populations provide independent confirmation of the veracity of the new hw - redshifts . while beyond the scope of the present paper , investigations of associated absorber populations are in hand using the full sdss dr7 legacy release spectroscopic database .",
