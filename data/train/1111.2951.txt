    "the main object of this work is a particular non - commutative field theory which is derived using the spectral action principle and then treated numerically .",
    "non - commutativity can be found in many fields of physics like quantum field theories , string theory , condensed matter physics .",
    "the first application of non - commutativity into physics is dated from the middle of the last century inspired by the ideas of quantum mechanics , where starting from classical mechanics , the commutative algebra of functions on the phase space is replaced by a non - commutative operator algebra on a hilbert space .",
    "the duality between ordinary spaces @xmath1 and proper commutative algebras is expressed by the gelfand - naimark theorem which states the fact that the algebra of all continuous functions on @xmath1 is the only possible type of commutative @xmath2-algebra . additionally , given a commutative @xmath2-algebra @xmath3 , it is possible to reconstruct a hausdorff topological space @xmath1 in order to obtain that @xmath3 is the algebra of continuous functions on @xmath1 .",
    "the study of commutative @xmath2-algebras is equivalent to the study of topological hausdorff spaces .",
    "the previous duality has inspired the identification , in non - commutative geometry , of some algebraical objects as a category of non - commutative topological spaces .",
    "alain connes @xcite , one of the founders of non - commutative geometry , has proposed a candidate for the objects of such category , the spectral triples @xmath4 @xcite , composed by an algebra @xmath5 , an hilbert space @xmath6 on which @xmath5 is represented and an selfadjoint operator @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , every compact oriented riemannian manifold can be used to define a spectral triple , this kind of manifold @xmath1 characterizes a dirac operator on self - adjoint clifford module bundles over @xmath1 .",
    "connes , after a conjecture in 1996 @xcite and some considerable attempts of rennie and varilly @xcite , proved the so called reconstruction theorem @xcite for commutative spectral triples satisfying various axioms , showing that exists a compact oriented smooth manifold @xmath8 such that @xmath9 is the algebra of smooth functions on @xmath8 and every compact oriented smooth manifold emerges in this way",
    ". pushed by the aim of reformulating the standard model of particles in a non - commutative way @xcite , connes has introduced the almost - commutative spectral triple extending the axioms of the reconstruction theorem to a non - commutative algebra .",
    "a first attempt to formulate a field theory for a truly non - commutative algebra was obtained replacing in the usual field theory action the point - wise multiplication of the fields with a non - commutative one , namely a @xmath10-product .",
    "the fields now belongs to @xmath11 , a vector space defined by an enough regular class functions on @xmath11 equipped with the moyal product : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a skew - symmetric matrix .",
    "a very important question about non - commutative quantum field theory @xcite , is whether or not the quantum theory is well - defined or in other words if it is renormalizable or not . at first sight ,",
    "the non - locality of the non - commutate action induced by the @xmath10-product in the position space can induce us to fear some problems for the renormalization .",
    "in fact it was discovered @xcite that after computing the feynman rules for such theory and deriving the loop amplitude we find that the non - local interaction terms in the action induce an oscillatory factors ( involving loop momenta ) in the feynman integrals .",
    "studying the structure of feynman diagrams for the action , filk @xcite has showed that are present two types of loop diagram the planar and non - planar diagrams .",
    "the planar diagrams do not have this oscillatory factors coming from the non - local interaction terms , and therefore the corresponding integrals are the same as in usual quantum field theory . on the other hand ,",
    "all non - planar diagrams have the oscillatory factors involving loop momenta . due to this terms the renormalization of quantum field theories on the non - commutative @xmath14",
    "is not achieved and these models show a phenomenon called uv / ir - mixing @xcite .",
    "chepelev and roiban @xcite analyses uv / ir - mixing to all orders , the conclusion of the power - counting theorem is that field theories on non - commutative @xmath14 are not renormalizable if the divergence of their commutative counterparts are higher than logarithmic .",
    "a great step towards the non - commutative field theory was made when h.grosse and r.wulkenhaar @xcite , found a non - commutative @xmath15-theory renormalizable action which develops additional marginal coupling , corresponding to an harmonic oscillator potential for the real - valued free field @xmath16 on @xmath11 : @xmath17=\\int d^4x \\left(\\frac{1}{2 } \\varphi \\star ( -\\delta+\\omega^2 \\tilde{x}^2 + \\mu^2)\\star\\varphi + \\frac{\\lambda}{4}\\varphi \\star \\varphi \\star \\varphi \\star \\varphi\\right)(x ) \\nonumber\\ ] ] where @xmath18 $ ] , and @xmath19 is a real parameter . using the moyal matrix base , which turns the @xmath10-product into a standard ( infinite ) matrix product , h.grosse and r.wulkenhaar were able to prove the perturbative renormalizability of the theory @xcite .",
    "afterward , r.wulkenhaar et al .",
    "@xcite found an alternative simpler normalization proof using multi - scale analysis in matrix base , showing the equivalence of various renormalization schemes .",
    "a last , but useful , renormalization proof was formulated using symanzik type hyperbolic polynomials @xcite .",
    "the non - commutative model treated in this work is a sort of extension , via spectral action principle , of the scalar w - g model , in which we are interested to formulate a yang - mills theory in renormalizable way on moyal space .",
    "we can expect that usual yang - mills theory on moyal space without modifications of the action by something similar to an oscillator potential , to be not renormalizable @xcite .",
    "additionally , the moyal space with usual dirac operator is a spectral triple , the corresponding spectral action was computed in @xcite , with the result that it is the usual not renormalizable action on moyal plane . in @xcite",
    "h.grosse and r.wulkenhaar , in order to obtain a gauge theory with an oscillator potential via the spectral action principle , used a dirac operator constructed using the statement @xmath20 where the four dimensional laplacian is substituted by the four dimensional oscillator hamiltonian @xmath21 .",
    "the idea behind is that the spectral dimension is defined through the dirac operator so the spectral dimension defined by such dirac operator is related to the harmonic oscillator phase space dimension .",
    "it turns out that to write down an dirac operator , so that its square equals the 4d harmonic oscillator hamiltonian , is an easy task using eight dimension clifford algebra .",
    "in addition , can be shown that using this dirac operator on 4d - moyal space , is possible define an eight - dimensional spectral triple .",
    "after defined the dirac operator with the desired spectrum it is considered the total spectral triple as the tensor product of the `` oscillating '' spectral triple @xmath22 with an almost - commutative triple and then is perform the previous described procedure of non - commutative geometry to compute the spectral action .",
    "we notice that matrix algebra introduces an extension of the standard potential in the commutative case , in fact the scalar field @xmath23 and the @xmath24 fields are present together in a potential of the form @xmath25 , with @xmath26 and @xmath27 is a covariant coordinate .",
    "the high non - triviality of the vacuum makes very difficult to explicit the vacuum configuration of the system in @xcite a. de goursac , j.c .",
    "wallet , and r. wulkenhaar , using the matrix base formalism , have found an expressions from vacuum solutions deriving them from the relevant solutions of the equations of motion .",
    "although , the complexity of the vacuum configuration makes the perturbative approach very complicated , in order to conduct some investigations will be considered a non - perturbative scheme using a discretized matrix model of the action in which the fields become matrices , the star product become the matrix multiplication and the integral turns in a matrix trace .",
    "now comes in to play the numerical treatment , the standard method is to approximate the space by discrete points , for example using a lattice approximation and then calculate the observables over that set of points @xcite .",
    "since an approximation in the position space is not suitable due to the oscillator factor of the moyal product , instead the lattice approximation , will be used the matrix moyal base , which was already used in the first renormalization proof of @xmath15-model restricted to finite matrices .",
    "hence , will be performed a monte carlo simulation studying some statistical quantity such the energy density and specific heat varying the parameters @xmath28 and gathering some informations on the various contributions of the fields to the action .",
    "the simulations are quite cumbersome due the complexity of the action and the number of independent matrices to handle but we are able to get an acceptable balance between the computation precision and the computation time . for the simulations is applied a standard metropolis - monte carlo algorithm @xcite with various estimators for the error and for the autocorrelation time of the samples . in general",
    "we chose the range of parameters in order to avoid problems with the thermalization process , obtaining numerical simulations where is enough to wait a relative small number of monte carlo steps to compute independent results from the initial conditions .",
    "we are interested on the continuous limit that correspond to matrices of infinite size .",
    "we will consider various size of the matrices expecting a stabilization of the values of observables like the energy density , increasing the matrix size . in order to find same possible phase transitions",
    "will be used the specific heat which is a measure of the dispersion of the energy .",
    "the phase transitions are registered as peaks of the specific heat , increasing the matrices size .",
    "in this section will be computed a spectral action starting from a non - commutative spectral triple .",
    "the feature of this particular triple is the choice of a 4-dimension harmonic dirac operator .",
    "the idea behind this construction @xcite is to relate the dirac operator with the oscillator hamiltonian operator . roughly speaking ,",
    "we look at the dirac operator as a generalization of the laplace operator so we have @xmath29 . considering the spectrum @xmath30 @xmath31 of the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator hamiltonian @xmath32 ,",
    "can be deduced that @xmath33 is a non - commutative infinitesimal of order one .",
    "the non - commutative dimension of a spectral triple , equipped with the 4d harmonic dirac operator @xmath34 , is fixed by the non - commutative order of the inverse operator @xmath35 which is eight not four .",
    "this occurrence connects the spectral dimension to the phase space dimension instead the one of the configuration space @xcite . in order to construct such harmonic dirac operator and the spectral triple we will work in the framework of the generalized @xmath36-dimensional harmonic operators .",
    "will be studied the 4-dimensional case in order to construct the non - commutative spectral triple which is starting point for the field theory we are interested in .",
    "having the 4-dimensional harmonic dirac operator with harmonic oscillator spectrum , to implement the higgs mechanism we will consider the tensor product of the non - commutative triple with a finite connes - lott type spectral triple @xcite .",
    "we will fluctuate the total dirac operator following the standard machinery @xcite of non - commutative geometry to get `` gauged '' dirac operator .",
    "thus we will proceed to compute the spectral action in which are present two u(1)-moyal yang - mills fields unified with a complex higgs field .",
    "* 1 *    the harmonic dirac operator in @xmath36-dimensions can be defined using the clifford algebra of @xmath37 represented on the hilbert space @xmath38 , it is very useful to consider @xmath36-dimensional fermionic annihilation and creation operators @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath36-dimensional bosonic annihilation and creation operators @xmath41 , @xmath42 satisfying for @xmath43 : @xmath44=[a^\\dagger_\\mu , a^\\dagger_\\nu]=0 , & [ a_\\mu , a^\\dagger_\\nu]=\\delta_{\\mu\\nu } \\label{com1 } \\\\   & \\{b_\\mu , b_\\nu\\}=\\{b_\\mu^\\dagger , b_\\nu^\\dagger\\}=0 , & \\{b_\\mu , b_\\nu^\\dagger\\}=\\delta_{\\mu\\nu } \\label{anti1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 . using this operators is possible to construct a dirac operator as : @xmath46 summed over repeated index .",

    "in the framework of non - commutative field theories on 4-dimensional moyal plane has been proved @xcite that the introduction of an harmonic oscillator term makes a @xmath66-model on 4-dimensional moyal plane renormalizable .",
