    "the photometric observations were made through different combinations of broad - band filters .",
    "generally , the brightness of 3c390.3 was scaled with respect to standard stars in the photometric sequence ( stars a , b , and d ) defined by penston , penston , & sandage ( 1971 ) , plus a hst guide star located at 208  from 3c390.3 at @xmath16 ( hst gs 4591:731 ) . in some cases , star a could not be used because of saturation .",

    "the used aperture was a 15  rectangle to ensure that the light loss can be neglected even in the case of bad seeing .",

    "finally , the @xmath2-band light curves of the other subsamples were shifted to the @xmath2-band light curve derived from the heidelberg sample by applying a constant additive magnitude offset to all of the measurements in a given subset .",
    "the additive factor was derived by comparison of @xmath2-band magnitudes which were observed within @xmath183 days .",
    "the additive factors for the individual subsamples are presented in table 5 .",
    "the additive scaling factors given in table 5 are quite large in some cases .",
    "generally , the brightness variations of 3c390.3 were provided in magnitudes using the standard stars in the field for calibration .",
    "but a few groups ( m , r , u ) provided the brightness of 3c390.3 as differential magnitudes relative to the calibration stars in the field .",

    "this restriction could not be used for the special astrophysical observatory ( j ) ; in this case , the offset is based on epochs separated by no more than 6 days .",
    "the resulting additive scaling factors are given in table 5 .",
    "the sample recorded at behlen observatory ( q ) was used as the standard in the @xmath1-band because the temporal sampling is good and the measurements were made through a large aperture ( 13  .",
    "@xmath197 ) so that uncertainties due to seeing variations are small .",
    "the @xmath1-band measurements are made relative to star b , which is close in brightness to the nucleus of 3c 390.3 . in order to scale the @xmath1-magnitudes to a common flux level , we compared measurements at epochs separated by no more than three days . in table 5 ,",
    "the differential magnitudes are given which were applied to the individual light curves to produce a common light curve .",
    "for the calibration of the @xmath3-band magnitudes we used observations taken at calar alto observatory .",
    "the @xmath3-band frames were recorded in december 1994 .",
    "the calibration was based on the globular cluster ngc2419 using the stars given by christian et al.(1985 ) .",

    "the additive factors for the individual subsamples are presented in table 5 .",
    "the measured brightnesses of the stars used for calibration are in good agreement with the values provided by penston et al .",
    "however , star a deviates from this trend in @xmath2 and @xmath3 in comparison to stars b and d. it might be that this is due to the brightness of star a causing non - linearity effects and an underestimate of the brightness of star a. after combining the measurements of the individual groups to common broad - band light curves , the apparent magnitudes were transformed into flux .",
    "the conversion has been performed using the following equations ( allen 1973 ; wamsteker 1981 ) : @xmath20 the resulting time - binned light curves from the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 broad - band measurements in units of @xmath21ergs  s@xmath12@xmath22@xmath12 are displayed in figure 1 .",
    "the flux calibration of agn spectra can be accomplished in several ways . in variability studies , it is common practice to normalize the flux scale to the fluxes of the narrow emission lines , which are assumed to be constant over time scales of at least several decades ( peterson 1993 ) .",
    "this assumption is justified by the large spatial extent and low gas density of the narrow - line region ( nlr ) , since light travel - time effects and the long recombination time scale ( @xmath23years for @xmath24@xmath25 ) damp out short time - scale variability .",
    "however , 3c390.3 is apparently a special case in this regard , as narrow - line variability has been reported in this object ( clavel & wamsteker 1987 ) . on the basis of spectra obtained between 1974 and 1990 , zheng et al .",
    "( 1995 ) present evidence that the [ oiii]@xmath26 , 5007 fluxes follow the variations in the continuum , although on a longer time scale than the broad emission lines . during the period of decreasing and increasing [ oiii ]",
    "flux there might also be periods of several months or one year of nearly constant [ oiii ]  flux .",
    "however , we need to examine the data closely to test for variability of the [ oiii ]  lines before we use them for flux calibration .    two data sets , the ohio state sample ( a ) and the lick observatory sample ( b ) , were selected to measure the absolute flux in the [ oiii]@xmath27  line .",
    "the spectra were photometrically calibrated by comparison with the broad - band photometric measurements .",
    "the spectra were convolved with the spectral response curve of the johnson @xmath1 and @xmath2 filters ( schild 1983 ) , and the flux of the convolved spectra was measured for the wavelength range of the filter curves and compared with photometric data points .",
    "photometric and spectroscopic data obtained no more than 3 days apart were used in this comparison .",
    "the spectra were then scaled by multiplicative factors to achieve the same total flux ratio as the intercalibrated photometric measurements in @xmath1 and @xmath2 . for the lick data",
    "( b ) , the @xmath2-band measurements were used to scale the entire spectrum , and the [ oiii]@xmath27  flux was then measured .",
    "spectra from the ohio state sample ( a ) do not cover the entire wavelength range of the @xmath1-band filter , and therefore the missing contribution to the @xmath1-band measurement was estimated from the lick spectra , which cover the entire wavelength range of the @xmath1 bandpass .",
    "the ratio of @xmath1-band flux measured from the ohio state spectra to that measured from the lick spectra was found to be @xmath28 , i.e. , a constant contribution .",
    "the fluxes from the ohio state spectra were thus corrected by this constant factor .",
    "the [ oiii]@xmath27  flux was then measured from the photometrically scaled ohio state ( a ) and lick observatory ( b ) spectra by integrating the spectrum over the range 52585320 .",
    "therefore , a linear pseudo - continuum was fitted beneath the [ oiii]@xmath27emission line . in fig .  2",
    ", we show the [ oiii]@xmath27  flux measured from the ohio state and lick subsets normalized to a mean value of unity and displayed as a function of time .",
    "no time - dependent trend is detected , and the rms variation about the mean is @xmath29% .",
    "we thus conclude that it is safe to assume that the [ oiii]@xmath27  flux is constant within a few percent over the duration of this monitoring program , and that the [ oiii]@xmath27  flux can be used to calibrate all of the spectra .",

    "it is also important to take aperture effects into account ( peterson & collins 1983 ) .",
    "the seeing - dependent uncertainties which are introduced by the aperture geometry can be minimized by using large apertures .",
    "it has been shown that apertures of 5  @xmath31 7  .",
    "@xmath195 can reduce seeing - dependent photometric errors to no more than a few percent in the case of nearby agns ( peterson et al .",
    "1995 ) . in the case of 3c390.3",
    ", the blr and the nlr can be taken to be point sources ( cf .",
    "baum et al .  1988 ) , which means that no aperture correction needs to be made for the agn continuum / narrow - line flux ratios or the broad - line / narrow - line ratios , since seeing - dependent light losses at the slit will be the same for each of these components . however , the amount of host - galaxy starlight that is recorded is still aperture dependent , and systematic corrections need to be employed .    in order to estimate how sensitive the measurements are to seeing - dependent light loss from the host galaxy , we carried out simulated aperture photometry on the @xmath2-band frame obtained at calar alto with the 2.2-m telescope under good seeing conditions ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the host galaxy has been separated from the point - like agn component by fitting a de vaucouleurs @xmath33 profile to the observed surface - brightness distribution .",
    "this image was convolved with gaussians of various width to simulate various seeing conditions up to 4  . @xmath190 .",
    "the flux of the host galaxy and of the point - like agn were measured for a fixed aperture of 10  .",
    "@xmath195x10  .",
    "the flux ratio of the point - line agn to the host galaxy for the @xmath2-band is @xmath34 .",
    "this is similar to the result of smith & heckman ( 1989 ) , who found @xmath35 for @xmath1-band measurements . by using different aperture geometries in these simulations",
    ", we find that the ratio of agn light to starlight from the host galaxy changes over the full range of observed seeing values by less than 1% for the larger apertures ( i.e. , slit width greater than 4 ) . for intermediate slit widths ( 2  .",
    "@xmath195  3  .",
    "@xmath196 ) , seeing variations introduce uncertainties of @xmath36% . for the smallest slit widths ( @xmath37 ) ,",
    "seeing effects can alter the nucleus to starlight ratio by as much as @xmath38% , with the largest uncertainties occurring for seeing worse than @xmath39 .",
    "since the data that constitute the various samples were taken with different instruments in different configurations , the spectra have to be intercalibrated to a common flux level . as we have shown above , the [ oiii]@xmath27  line flux was constant to better than 3% during this campaign , so we can safely use the narrow emission lines as flux standards . in order to avoid any wavelength - dependent calibration errors ,",
    "each spectrum was scaled in flux locally over a limited wavelength range prior to measurement .",
    "the h@xmath6  spectral region was scaled with respect to the [ oiii]@xmath26 , 5007 line fluxes , while the h@xmath5  region was scaled with respect to the fluxes of the [ oi]@xmath40 and [ nii]@xmath41 , 6584 emission lines .",
    "the spectra were intercalibrated using the method described by van groningen & wanders ( 1992 ) .",
    "this procedure corrects the data for different flux scales , small wavelength shifts , and different spectral resolutions by minimizing the narrow - line residuals in difference spectra formed by subtracting a `` reference spectrum '' from each of the observed spectra .",
    "the rescaled spectra are used to derive integrated emission - line fluxes as well as the optical continuum flux .",
    "the continuum fluxes are then adjusted for different amounts of host - galaxy contamination ( see peterson et al .",

    "@xmath195 ) , was adopted as a standard ( i.e. , @xmath45 by definition ) , and other data sets were merged progressively by comparing measurements based on observations made no more than @xmath183 days apart .",
    "this means that any real variability that occurs on time scales this short tends to be somewhat suppressed by the process that allows us to combine the different data sets . the additive scaling factor @xmath44 for the various samples are given in table 6 .",
    "the average interval between measurements is about @xmath46days for @xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath3 while the @xmath0-band variations have been measured with an average sampling interval of @xmath49days ( table 7 ) .",
    "the time - binned broad - band continuum light curves are shown in fig .  1 . the variations can be characterized as a nearly monotonic increase of the flux with smaller - scale variations superposed on this general trend . from jd2449760 to jd2449800 , the flux rose in the v , r , i bands faster than during the previous interval .",
    "after this period , the flux level stays nearly constant for nearly 3 months and then a second strong increasing episode follows .",
    "the @xmath1-band light curve appears to have more complicated structure , and we note in particular apparently rapid variations during the interval jd2449800 to jd2449920 .    figure 3 shows two spectra of 3c390.3 that represent the low ( jd2449636 ) and high ( jd2450007 ) flux states observed during this campaign .",
    "the most obvious variation is the strong increase of the small blue bump , the very broad feature shortward of 4000 , which is usually ascribed to balmer continuum emission and a blend of several thousand feii  emission lines ( wills , netzer , & wills 1985 ) .",
    "the broad balmer lines show also evidence for increasing flux . underneath the low - state spectrum in fig .",
    "3 we show the integration ranges for the various features that have been measured in these spectra .",
    "the optical emission - line fluxes were integrated over a common range of @xmath50 ^ -1 km s@xmath12  for the strong balmer emission lines ( h@xmath5 , h@xmath6 , and h@xmath7 ) and i5876 hei@xmath8 .",
    "the ii4686 heii@xmath9  line flux was integrated over a range corresponding @xmath51 ^ -1 km s@xmath12  to @xmath52 ^ -1 km s@xmath12   to reduce contamination by h@xmath6(cf.table 8) .",
    "a local linear continuum fit was interpolated under each emission line . in the case of the h@xmath6   region ,",
    "the continuum was defined by the flux measured in two narrow ( 10  width ) windows at 4400  and 5475  in the observed frame .",
    "although the region of the long wavelength window might be contaminated by several weak emission lines and the mgb absorption feature , this is still the most line - free region near h@xmath6  and is thus an appropriate place to estimate the optical continuum flux . the continuum window at 4400  is displaced from the h@xmath7  line center by @xmath53 ^ -1 km s@xmath12 , and thus possible contamination by broad emission line flux can be safely ignored ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "contamination of h@xmath6  by [ oiii ] emission has been corrected by subtracting the constant [ oiii]@xmath27  flux given earlier plus the [ oiii]@xmath54 flux which we account for by assuming a [ oiii]@xmath27/[oiii]@xmath54 flux ratio of 3 . in the case of the h@xmath5  region ,",
    "two narrow ( 10  in width ) windows at 5960  and 7495  were used to define the continuum underlying the lines .",
    "no attempt has been made to correct any of the measured emission - line fluxes for their respective narrow - line contributions . in each spectrum ,",
    "the optical continuum flux measured is the average value in the range 54605470 .",
    "the extracted range of the emission lines and of the optical continuum is given in table 8 .",
    "the time - binned light curves for the strong emission lines and the optical continuum flux @xmath4(5177 ) measured from the calibrated spectra are plotted in fig .",
    "the corresponding flux measurements are available on the www at the url given above ( table 9 ) .",
    "a final check of the uncertainty estimates was performed by examining the ratios of all pairs of photometric and spectroscopic observations which were separated by 2 days or less .",
    "the error estimates were also calculated using maximum intervals of 3 days and 4 days , and the resulting errors are identical to within 3% . generally , there are at least a few hundred independent pairs of measurements within 2 days of one another for the photometric measurements .",
    "only the @xmath0-band curve yields fewer independent pairs . for the spectroscopic data",
    "the number of independent pairs is of the order of several dozen with the exception of h@xmath7 .",
    "the dispersion about the mean ( unity ) , divided by @xmath55 , provides an estimate of the typical uncertainty in a single measurement ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the observational uncertainties ( @xmath57 ) assigned to the spectral flux measurements were estimated from the error spectra which were calculated within the intercalibration routine , as well as from the signal - to - noise ratio within the spectral range near the individual emission lines . for the continuum the mean fractional error ( @xmath57 ) in a given measurement is 0.041 .",
    "the average fractional uncertainty from the quoted estimate ( @xmath56 ) for the same measurements ( table 10 ) is 0.040 which implies that the error estimates are probably quite good .",
    "generally , the estimated errors ( @xmath58 ) are of the same order as the observational uncertainties ( @xmath59 ) derived directly from the measurements .",
    "a comparison of the flux of the broad band measurements and the broad emission lines is given in table 11 .",
    "the mean spectroscopic continuum flux is lower than the mean broad band @xmath1- and @xmath2-flux .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the broad band flux measurements contain in addition to the continuum flux emission line contributions .",
    "the variability parameter @xmath60 and @xmath61 have been calculated for the broad - band flux variations ( cf .",
    "clavel et al .  1991 ; rodrguez - pascual et al .",
    "the quantity @xmath61 is simply the ratio of the maximum to the minimum flux .",
    "the quantity @xmath60 is an estimation of the fluctuations of the intrinsic variations relative to the mean flux .",
    "therefore , the rms of the light curves has been corrected with respect to the uncertainties introduced by the observations .",
    "@xmath61 and @xmath60 of the broad - band variations are given in table 11 .",
    "we calculated the mean and root - mean - square ( rms ) spectra from the flux - scaled spectra , and the h@xmath5  and h@xmath6  regions are shown in fig .",
    "the velocity scale is set by adopting a redshift @xmath62 given by the narrow components of h@xmath5  and h@xmath6  and the [ oiii]@xmath63 emission lines , i.e.  the restframe of the nlr .",
    "the rms spectrum is useful for isolating the variable parts of the line profile .",
    "the full - width at zero intensity ( fwzi ) of the mean h@xmath5  and h@xmath6profiles is ( 25000@xmath182000)^-1 km s@xmath12 , while the fwzi of the rms profiles is only ( 14000@xmath18500)^-1 km s@xmath12 ( cf.fig.5 ) .",
    "thus , the variations in the broad emission line profiles are strong at lower radial velocities while the flux originating in high radial - velocity gas varies little , if at all .",
    "this behavior is similar to what has been seen in mrk 590 ( ferland , korista , & peterson 1990 ; peterson et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "the line profiles of h@xmath5  and h@xmath6   show clear asymmetric structure .",
    "at least three substructures can be identified in both line profiles . a blue hump in the mean spectra",
    "is located near @xmath64 ^ -1 km s@xmath12  with respect to the line peak , and a red hump is seen near @xmath65 ^ -1 km s@xmath12 .",
    "the red and blue humps can be seen clearly in the rms spectra , and in addition a broad central component appears .",
    "if these three components are modeled as gaussians , the fwhm of the components in the wings is of order @xmath66 ^ -1 km s@xmath12 , while for the central component the fwhm is @xmath67 ^ -1 km s@xmath12 .",

    "the iccf and dcf algorithms and the limitations of the methods have been discussed in detail by robinson & prez ( 1990 ) and by white & peterson ( 1994 ) , and the specific implementation of the iccf and dcf used here are as described by white & peterson ( 1994 ) .",
    "the emission lines are expected to change in response to variations in the far - uv continuum , primarily to the unobservable wavelengths just shortward of 912 .",
    "we must therefore assume that the observable continuum can approximate the behavior of the ionizing continuum .",
    "it is generally assumed in this type of analysis that the shortest observed uv wavelength provides the best observable approximation to the `` driving '' ( ionizing ) continuum .",
    "for the first time , however , we have a well - sampled simultaneous soft x - ray light curve ( leighly et al .",
    "1997 ) , so we can compare the x - ray and uv continua ( obrien et al .  1998 ) directly . in this analysis",
    ", we used the x - ray light curve as the driving continuum ( fig.6 ) since the observational uncertainties are smaller than for the uv light curve .",
    "as will be discussed elsewhere ( obrien et al .",
    "1998 ) , the relative amplitudes of the ultraviolet variations at a wavelength of 1370  are nearly identical to those in the _ rosat _ hri light curve , so the results presented here do not depend critically on our choice of the x - ray light curve in preference to the uv light curve .",
    "since the sampling of the @xmath0-band light curve is very poor , we have excluded the @xmath0-band data from the cross - correlation analysis .",
    "operationally , the temporal coverage of the optical light curves was restricted to the period covered by the x - ray measurements .",
    "all of the light curves were binned into time intervals of 0.5 days to avoid unnecessary structure in the iccf . for each light curve",
    ", we also computed the sampling - window autocorrelation function ( acf@xmath70 ) , which is a measure of how much of the width of the acf is introduced by the interpolation process rather than by real correlation of the continuum values at different times .",
    "the acf@xmath70 is computed by repeatedly sampling white - noise light curves in exactly the same way as the real observations and then computing the autocorrelation function ( acf ) .",
    "the average of many such autocorrelations , the acf@xmath70 , has a peak at zero lag whose width depends on how much interpolation the iccf has to do on short time scales .",
    "the width ( fwhm ) of the acf@xmath70 is @xmath71 days for the emission lines and broad - band flux measurements for the x - ray restricted time period .",
    "these values are negligible compared to the widths of any of the emission - line acfs or ccfs found here ( see figs .",
    "79 ) , and thus interpolation of the light curves is justified .",
    "the general sampling characteristics of each of the restricted and rebinned light curves are given in table 12 .",
    "the name of the feature is given in column ( 1 ) , and column ( 2 ) gives the total number of points @xmath72 in the light curve that are used in computing the cross - correlation functions .",
    "the width ( fwhm ) of the acf is given in column ( 3 ) , and the width of iccf computed by cross - correlation with the x - ray continuum is given in column ( 4 ) .",
    "column ( 5 ) gives the width ( fwhm ) of the corresponding acf@xmath70 .",
    "uncertainties in the iccf results for the cross - correlation maxima and centroids , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively , were computed through monte carlo techniques as follows : for both time series , each flux value in the light curves was modified with gaussian deviates based on the quoted uncertainty for that point .",
    "each light curve of @xmath72 points was then randomly resampled @xmath72 times in a `` bootstrap '' fashion , specifically allowing points to appear more than one time ( the effect of which is only to remove at random certain points from the light curve ) .",
    "the iccf was computed , and the values of @xmath75 and @xmath76 were recorded if they were statistically significant at a confidence level higher than 95% and not clear outliers ( e.g. , lags larger than 100 days ) . by repeating this process 5001000 times , distributions of @xmath75 and @xmath76",
    "were built up .",
    "the means of these distributions were always very close to the values of @xmath75 and @xmath76 obtained from the original series , and the standard deviations of these distributions are taken to be the uncertainty associated with a single realization , i.e. , the quoted uncertainties @xmath77 and @xmath74 .",
    "the acf , acf@xmath70 , iccf , and zdcf are shown for the broad - band variations in @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "7 ) , the broad balmer emission lines h@xmath5 ,",
    "h@xmath6 , and h@xmath7  ( fig .  8) , the helium lines i5876 hei@xmath8  and ii4686 heii@xmath9 , and the optical continuum @xmath4(5177 ) ( fig",
    "the acfs of the light curves are broad since the shape is dominated by the nearly monotonic increase in the light curves .",
    "the fwhms of the acfs of the well - sampled light curves are of the order of 50100days ( table 12 ) . within the uncertainties ,",
    "the dcfs and zdcfs are identical ; therefore , to avoid confusion only the iccfs and the corresponding zdcfs are displayed in figs .",
    "the time delay derived from the centroid of a cross - correlation function provides a more robust estimate of the lag than does the peak , as evidenced by the consistently smaller widths of the monte carlo distributions for the centroid compared to the peak .",
    "also , in the case of the emission lines , the centroid is readily identified with a physically meaningful quantity , the luminosity - weighted radius of the line - emitting region ( koratkar & gaskell 1991 ) .",
    "the delays expressed by @xmath78 of the three methods used here are nearly identical within the uncertainties , although the dcf method tends to yield smaller delays than the iccf and zdcf method .",
    "the results of the cross - correlation analysis are given in table 13 .",
    "column ( 1 ) indicates the `` responding '' light curve ( i.e. , the light curve that is assumed to be responding to the driving light curve ) , and column ( 2 ) gives the peak value of the correlation coefficient @xmath79 for the iccf .",
    "the position of the peak of the cross - correlation functions @xmath80 was measured by fitting a gaussian curve to the upper 85% of the iccf , zdcf , and dcf ; these values are given in columns ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 5 ) , respectively , and column ( 6 ) gives the error estimate for the position of the cross - correlation peak @xmath77 .",
    "the centroids @xmath78 of the iccf , zdcf , and dcf , in each case computed using the points in the cross - correlation function with values greater than @xmath81 , are given in columns ( 7 ) , ( 8) , and ( 9 ) , respectively , and the uncertainty in the iccf centroid @xmath82 is given in column ( 10 ) .    the broad - band ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 ) and the optical continuum flux variations appear to be delayed by a few days , relative to the x - ray or ultraviolet continuum variations",
    "however , the measured lags are in no case different from zero at any reasonable level of statistical significance if the monte - carlo based error estimates are reliable . somewhat smaller , but marginally statistically significant , wavelength - dependent continuum lags have been reported in the case of ngc 7469 ( wanders et al .",
    "1997 ; collier et al .",
    "1997 ) , although in the case of ngc 7469 the mean spacing between observations of the driving continuum is much smaller than for the observations reported here .",
    "the emission - line time delays are similar for all of the optical emission lines , about 20 days , although in each case the uncertainties are somewhat larger than we have obtained in similar experiments on account of the vagaries of the continuum behavior and sampling . within the uncertainties , the measured time delays for h@xmath5 , h@xmath6 , h@xmath7 , and",
    "i5876 hei@xmath8  are indistinguishable",
    ". however , the uncertainties are sufficiently large that ionization stratification , as detected in other well - studied sources , also can not be ruled out . only ii4686 heii@xmath9  appears to respond more rapidly than the other lines , but the relatively low value of @xmath79 and relatively narrow width of the cross - correlation function ( about 30 days as compared to @xmath83 days for the other lines ) cast some doubt on the significance of this result .",
    "in contrast to the agn studied before , the delay of the ly@xmath5 and iv civ line variations of the current 3c390.3 campaign is significantly larger than the delay of the optical lines .",
    "the analysis of the ultraviolet spectra yields a delay of 35  70 days for ly@xmath5  and iv civ  ( obrien et al .  1998 ) .    in order to study the response of individual parts of the line profile to the x - ray continuum variations and thus search for evidence of an organized radial - velocity field in the blr , we have divided the profiles of the strongest and least contaminated lines , h@xmath5  and h@xmath6 , into three parts : the blue wing ( @xmath51 to @xmath84kms@xmath12 ) , the core ( @xmath85 to @xmath86kms@xmath12 ) , and the red wing ( @xmath87 to @xmath88kms@xmath12 ) .",
    "the light curves of the different profile sections ( cf.figs .",
    "10,11 ) were rebinned onto 0.5-day intervals ( available in electronic form on the www at the url given above as table 14 ) and again cross - correlations were performed restricting the data to the x - ray monitoring period .",
    "since we are concerned at this point with _ differential _ lags between different sections of the line profiles , we cross - correlate the light curves for the different line sections against each other rather than against the driving continuum ; we arbitrarily chose the line cores as the first ( driving ) series , and computed the lags of the red and blue wings of the lines relative to the core .",
    "these results are shown in table 15 and in figs .",
    "12 and 13 .",
    "neither h@xmath5  nor h@xmath6  shows any evidence for any differences in the response of the wings relative to the core . in the case of h@xmath5 ,",
    "the uncertainties are especially large on account of the low amplitude of variability , but the h@xmath6  results seem to exclude the possibility that the blr velocity field is characterized by primarily radial motions , either infall or outflow .",
    "the results of a year - long ( 1994 october to 1995 october ) optical monitoring campaign on the blrg 3c390.3 are presented in this paper .",
    "the principal findings are as follows :    1 .   the broad - band ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 ) fluxes , the optical continuum measured from spectrophotometry @xmath4(5177 ) , and the integrated emission - line fluxes of h@xmath5 , h@xmath6 , h@xmath7 , i5876 hei@xmath8 , and ii4686 heii@xmath9  showed significant variations of order 50% in amplitude .",
    "2 .   the parameter @xmath60 , which is essentially the rms variation about the mean , increased with decreasing wavelength for the broad - band measurements as well as for the balmer emission lines . 3 .",
    "the variations of the broad - band and emission - line fluxes are delayed with respect to the x - ray variations .",
    "cross - correlation functions were calculated with three different methods ( iccf , dcf , and zdcf ) .",
    "the time delays of the optical continuum variations expressed by the centroid of the cross - correlation functions are typically about 5 days , but with uncertainties of @xmath105 days .",
    "therefore , zero - time delay between the high - energy and low - energy continuum variability can not be ruled out .",
    "the delays of the balmer lines h@xmath5 , h@xmath6 , and h@xmath7 and of i5876 hei@xmath8are typically around 20 days @xmath18 8 days .",
    "there is some evidence that ii4686 heii@xmath9  responds somewhat more rapidly with a time delay of @xmath1010 days , but again the uncertainties are quite large ( @xmath108 days ) .",
    "4 .   the simple cross - correlation analysis of the line core with the line profile wings of the h@xmath5 and h@xmath6 emission might indicate that the wings vary in the same way with respect to the line core .",
    "but there might be a weak indication that the variations of the blue wing are delayed by @xmath10 4 days with respect to the red wing .",
    "the mean and rms h@xmath5  and h@xmath6  line profiles reveal the existence of at least three substructures  a central component , plus strong blue and red components at about @xmath11 ^ -1 km s@xmath12  relative to line center .",
    "the rms spectra show that the broad - line variations are much stronger at line center than in the outer wings .",
