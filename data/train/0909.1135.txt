    "geometric curvature of nano - scale conducting films with curved geometry@xcite provides us a clue to synthesize a new class of quantum devices based on curved nanomaterials .",
    "the most relevant nature is the occurrence of a _ curvature - dependent potential _ (",
    "cp ) that acts on low - energy electrons moving in the curved systems@xcite .",
    "the mechanism of the cp have been considered from various perspectives@xcite , which triggered interesting theoretical predictions on the electric transport properties of curved nanostructures : quantum transmission probabilities in y - nanojunction@xcite , a charge separation in helicoidal ribbons@xcite , and an anomalous shift of the tomonaga - luttinger exponent in deformed nanocylinders@xcite are only a few to mention .    in the earlier work ,",
    "the authors have studied the cp effect on the electrical resistivity of corrugated semiconductor films@xcite .",
    "a specific magnitude of the corrugation amplitude turned out to cause a significant increase in the resistivity , which is due to the cp - enhanced population of the electron - electron umklapp scattering processes relevant to the resistivity .",
    "this result motivates us to complete a thorough check of the cp effect in a wider range of two geometric parameters , i.e. , the corrugation amplitude and period , that determine the shape of the corrugated film .",
    "this attempt is crucially important in order to make use of the effect in developing curved - nanomaterial - based quantum devices .",
    "sketch of a periodic curved surface .",
    "it is represented by @xmath0 with a corrugation amplitude @xmath1 and a period @xmath2 .",
    "the curvilinear coordinates ( @xmath3,@xmath4 ) used in this paper are embedded in the surface . ]    in this paper , we analyze systematically the correlation between the two geometric parameters and the cp - induced resistivity enhancement of the corrugated semiconductor films . we show that the degree of contributions from electron - electron scatterings to the resistivity is strongly dependent on the values of the two parameters .",
    "the present results enable to determine the maximal surface geometry that is requisite for the resistivity enhancement to get sizable in actual experiments .",
    "let us consider a two dimensional ( 2d ) electron system confined to a thin film , in which the film is subjected to an unidirectional corrugation along the @xmath5 axis .",
    "the height of the film in the @xmath6 direction is given by @xmath7 where @xmath1 and @xmath8 are the amplitude and period of corrugation , respectively ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : curve ] ) . by transforming the variables",
    "@xmath9 into @xmath10 with the definition @xmath11 , we obtain the schrdinger equation @xcite @xmath12 \\psi ( \\xi , \\eta)=e \\psi ( \\xi , \\eta ) .",

    "equation ( [ eq : xieta ] ) is solved by using the fourier series expansion @xmath16 \\exp ( ik^\\eta \\eta ) ,   \\label{eq : wave}\\ ] ] as a result of which the energy - band structure @xmath17 with respect to the wavevector @xmath18 is obtained .",
    "the periodic nature of @xmath13 with the period @xmath19 implies an occurrence of gaps at @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is a positive integer ) in the fermi circle , where @xmath22 defines the reciprocal lattice vector @xmath23 associated with the periodicity of @xmath13 .",
    "such gaps are observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fermi](b ) , where a sufficiently large amplitude of @xmath13 is assumed by setting appropriate values of @xmath1 and @xmath24 .",
    "still , it should be noted that gaps at @xmath20 may and may _ not _ occur once @xmath25 is given .",
    "this is primary because @xmath25 as well as @xmath26 are two - variable functions of @xmath1 and @xmath24 as understood from fig .",
    "[ fig : curve ] .",
    "hence , different pairs of the two values @xmath27 can yield the same value of @xmath25 , though the pairs do not always produce a gap at @xmath20 .    two contrast examples of the fermi circle are clearly demonstrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : fermi](a ) and [ fig : fermi](b ) .",
    "we set @xmath28 and @xmath29 to draw the fermi circles , in which both pairs give an identical value of @xmath25 as shown in the contour plot of @xmath30 in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] ; the points @xmath31 and @xmath32 in the plot correspond to fig .",
    "[ fig : fermi](a ) and [ fig : fermi](b ) , respectively . the fermi circle in fig.[fig :",
    "fermi](a ) has almost no gap , whereas that in fig.[fig : fermi](b ) shows clear gaps at @xmath33 and @xmath34 . as we shall see later ,",
    "usage of such pairs @xmath27 that lead to gaps in the fermi circle is a necessary condition for the corrugation - induced jump in the resistivity to be observed .",
    "we now consider the low - temperature resistivity of 2d electron systems under periodic modulation .",
    "contributions of two - electron scatterings to the resistivity at low temperature @xmath35 are expressed by@xcite @xmath36where @xmath37 are the boltzmann constant and the fermi energy , respectively .",
    "@xmath38 represent the contributions from the @xmath21th umklapp scatterings @xmath39 that satisfy the momentum conservation law : @xmath40 @xmath41 is satisfied because of the inversion symmetry of the fermi circle with respect to @xmath42 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : rho_c ] ) holds for @xmath43 , i.e. , when smearing of the fermi degeneracy by thermal fluctuation can be negligible so that electron - electron scatterings are allowed just on the fermi circle .",

    "are dominant in the total value of @xmath38@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the number of such dominant processes takes the maximum when gaps open at both ends of the fermi circle ( @xmath52 ) , i.e. , when the relation @xmath53 is satisfied . as a result , the surface corrugation with @xmath1 and @xmath24 that satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : gkf_eq ] ) can cause the corrugation - induced jump in @xmath47 .",
    "we emphasize again that eq .",
    "( [ eq : gkf_eq ] ) is a necessary ( not sufficient ) condition of the jump in @xmath47 , since gaps may and may not be present for a given @xmath25 .",
    "in numerical calculations of @xmath47 , we set @xmath54mev and employed material constants of the gaas / al@xmath55ga@xmath56as heterostructures : the effective mass is @xmath57=0.067 ( @xmath58 is a bare electron mass ) and the dielectric constant is @xmath59=13.2 ( @xmath60 is the dielectric constant of vacuum ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : rho_c1 ] shows the @xmath24 dependence of @xmath47 ; we fixed @xmath61=0.7 and increased @xmath24 from @xmath62 to @xmath63 as indicated by the dotted trajectory in fig .",

    "[ fig : rho_c1 ] , we also show the @xmath24 dependences of @xmath38 with @xmath67 , 1 and @xmath68 . the term @xmath69 is found to be dominant at all values of @xmath70 , which imply that overall behavior of @xmath47 in the @xmath24 region considered is determined by the first - order umklapp process .    it should be noted that in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_c1 ] , no peak appears at @xmath71 although the value satisfies the condition of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gkf_eq ] ) with @xmath72 .",
    "the disappearance of the peak in @xmath47 at @xmath71 is attributed to the absence of gaps associated with the second - order umklapp process , as discussed below in detail .",
    "we discuss the reason why the contributions from the second umklapp processes do not enhance @xmath47 at @xmath71 in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_c1 ] . figures [ fig : alpha](a ) and [ fig : alpha](b ) show the profiles of the fourier coefficients @xmath73 ( see eq .",

    "[ fig : map ] , respectively . in both figures , upward peaks of @xmath74 with @xmath75 touch downward peaks of @xmath73 at @xmath76 .",
    "the widths @xmath77 of the upward peaks are estimated as @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the fourier component of the cp .",
    "we can deduce from eq .",

    "( [ eq : width ] ) that @xmath82 increases monotonically with increasing @xmath1 and @xmath24 .",
    "notice that the larger width @xmath83 results in the larger @xmath47 , since the number of the associated umklapp processes increase .",
    "in fact , @xmath84 is needed to get @xmath85 under the condition that @xmath86 yields @xmath871 or 2 .",
    "( the magnitude of @xmath88 is large enough to observe it experimentally@xcite . )",
    "these arguments account for the reason why the parameters @xmath27 corresponding to @xmath31 , which provide @xmath89 , give no peak in @xmath47 in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_c1 ] .",
