    "on july 4 , 2012 , a new particle at around 125 gev was discovered at the lhc  @xcite . through measurements of the coupling property , spin and parity ,",
    "the new particle has so far been almost consistent with the higgs boson predicted as a key boson responsible for the origin of mass in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "one discrepancy from the sm higgs has been , however , reported in the diphoton channel  @xcite where the observed signal event is about two times larger than the sm higgs prediction .",
    "this would imply that the observed scalar boson is a sm - higgs impostor concerning the underlying theory beyond the sm .",
    "one such a possible impostor is the technidilaton ( td ) , a composite scalar boson , predicted in the walking technicolor ( wtc )  @xcite with an approximately scale - invariant ( conformal ) gauge dynamics and a large anomalous dimension @xmath0 .",
    "the td is a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson for the spontaneous breaking of the approximate scale symmetry triggered by technifermion condensation and hence its lightness , say 125 gev , would be protected by the approximate scale symmetry inherent to the wtc .",
    "thus the discovery of td would imply the discovery of the wtc .",
    "the lhc signatures of the td were studied in a couple of recent papers  @xcite .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that the 125 gev td is consistent with the currently reported diphoton signal as well as other signals such as @xmath1 and @xmath2 , etc .. it was emphasized that the td is favored by the current data thanks to the presence of extra technifermion loop corrections to digluon and diphoton couplings .",
    "this talk summarizes the 125 gev td phenomenology at the lhc and shows a theoretically interesting possibility that the td can indeed be as light as the 125 gev boson by certain nontrivial feature intrinsic to the dynamics of wtc .",
    "the stability of the td mass is also discussed , where it turns out that the large td decay constant plays an important role against corrections from the sm particles in a low - energy region to be relevant after the walking behavior .",
    "we start with a review of the characteristic features of wtc including the spontaneous breaking of both chiral and scale symmetries and the mass generation of td ( sec .",
    "[ wtc - td ] ) .",
    "we then discuss the size of the td mass following two approaches : straightforward nonperturbative computations in the ladder approximation  @xcite ( sec .",
    "[ lad - est ] ) and a model estimate in a view of holography applied to wtc  @xcite ( sec.[holo - est ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the ladder estimate , the holographic model incorporates effects from the technigluon condensation , which turns out to play the crucial role to realize the td mass on the order of 125 gev  @xcite .    to make direct contact with the lhc study",
    ", we derive a low - energy effective lagrangian  @xcite obtained by integrating out technifermions , which is governed by the lightest technihadron spectra involving the td ( sec .",
    "[ eff - lag ] ) .",
    "the lagrangian is constructed based on nonlinear realization of the scale symmetry as well as the chiral symmetry coupled to the sm particles via the sm gauge interactions .",
    "the td couplings to the sm particles are read off from the effective lagrangian .",
    "we then find that the couplings take essentially the same form as those of the sm particles , except two distinguishable ingredients : the overall scale of the couplings are set by the td decay constant ( @xmath3 ) associated with the spontaneous breaking of the scale symmetry , not by the electroweak ( ew ) scale ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "actually , @xmath3 turns out to be larger than @xmath4 from both ladder and holographic estimates .",
    "the other crucial discrepancy comes in the couplings to diphoton and digluon , which get effects from technifermion loop contributions to be either enhanced or suppressed , depending on models of wtc . to be concrete",
    ", we will take one - family model for the wtc to explicitly calculate those couplings .",
    "after understanding the td coupling property from the effective lagrangian , we pay attention to the stability of the td mass against radiative corrections arising from the sm particle loops .",
    "the large td decay constant @xmath3 then turns out to play the crucial role to keep the td mass around 125 gev without invoking heavy fine tunning , in contrast to the sm higgs case .",
    "finally , we shall explore the lhc production and decay processes of the 125 gev td in the one - family model and estimate the signal strengths for the relevant channels to be compared with the experimental data on the higgs searches ( sec .",
    "[ signal ] ) .",
    "it is shown that the td signal is consistent with the currently reported data and can give a better fit than the sm higgs , notably due to the presence of extra technifermion loop corrections .",
    "technicolor ( tc )  @xcite accommodates the ew symmetry breaking by technifermion condensation , without invoking the fundamental higgs boson , just like the quark condensation in qcd , and hence gives the dynamical explanation for the origin of mass . the original version of tc  @xcite , a naive scale - up version of qcd ,",
    "was ruled out due to the excessive flavor - changing neutral currents .",
    "a way out of this problem was suggested under a simple assumption of the existence of a large anomalous dimension for technifermion bilinear operator @xmath5 without any concrete dynamics and concrete value of the anomalous dimension  @xcite .",
    "it was the wtc  @xcite that exhibited a concrete dynamics based on a nonperturbative analysis of ladder schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equation with nonrunning ( scale invariant / conformal ) gauge coupling , @xmath6 , yielding a concrete value of the anomalous dimension , @xmath7 in the chiral broken phase .",
    "modern version of wtc  @xcite is based on the two - loop running coupling with the caswell - banks - zaks infrared fixed point  @xcite , instead of the nonrunning one , in the improved ladder sd equation .",
    "another problem of the tc as a qcd scale - up is the ew constraints , so - called @xmath8 and @xmath9 parameters .",
    "this may also be improved in the wtc  @xcite . even if wtc in isolation can not overcome this problem ,",
    "there still exist a possibility that the problem may be resolved in the combined dynamical system including the sm fermion mass generation such as the extended tc ( etc ) dynamics  @xcite , in much the same way as the solution ( `` ideal fermion delocalization '' )  @xcite in the higgsless models which simultaneously adjust @xmath8 and @xmath9 parameters by incorporating the sm fermion mass profile",
    ".    it would be better to understand the wtc through an illustration by the notion of gauge dynamics : figure [ alpha - beta ] shows a schematic view of the wtc in terms of the gauge coupling @xmath10 ( left panel ) and its beta function @xmath11 ( right panel ) . in a field theoretical sense , the  walking \" can be realized by an accidental balance between gluonic and fermionic contributions to the running of gauge coupling of @xmath12 gauge theory including @xmath13 fermions .",
    "in fact , the presence of walking region implies a pseudo infrared fixed point ( @xmath14 ) , a la caswell - banks - zack infrared fixed point based on the two - loop beta function in the large @xmath15 qcd  @xcite . during the walking region ( region ii in fig .",

    "the walking regime ( region ii ) expands in a wide range @xmath20 : below the infrared scale @xmath21 , technifermions decouple and hence the balance with technigluon contributions gets lost , leading to the one edge of walking ( region iii ) , while above the ultraviolet scale @xmath22 tev ) the theory will be embedded into an etc ( region i ) .",

    "[ alpha - beta ] .",
    "the chiral condensate @xmath26 is generated to scale with the large anomalous dimension @xmath27 which solves the flavor - changing neutral current problem  @xcite : @xmath28    of particular interest is the fact that the wtc possesses the ( approximate ) scale invariance ( @xmath29 for @xmath30 ) , which is spontaneously broken by the technifermion condensation / mass generation .",
    "this implies presence of a ( pseudo ) nambu - goldstone boson (  dilaton \" ) for the scale symmetry .",
    "this is a flavor - singlet composite scalar and may be a mixture of @xmath31 bound state and techniglueball .",
    "that is the td , technidilaton .",
    "the td gets massive essentially due to the  nonperturbative \" scale anomaly : according to the dynamical mass generation in eq.([miransky ] ) , the gauge coupling @xmath10 is renormalized , starts running and hence the  nonperturbative \" beta function @xmath32 is generated  @xcite : @xmath33 this induces the  nonperturbative \" scale anomaly : @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the dilatation current and @xmath36 the field strength of technigluon field . thus the td becomes massive due to the nonperturbative scale anomaly  @xcite .",
    "a straightforward calculation  @xcite based on the ladder sd equation and the ladder ( homogeneous ) bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation in the walking regime indicates a relatively light scalar bound state ( identified with td ) : @xmath37 for the one - family model with @xmath38 gev .",
    "this @xmath39 is much smaller than masses of the techni - vector / axial - vector mesons on tev range , but still larger than the lhc boson at 125 gev .",
    "this result is consistent with another calculation  @xcite based on the ladder sd equation and the ladder ( inhomogeneous ) bs equation , and also consistent with other indirect computation  @xcite based on the ladder gauged nambu - jona - lasinio model .",
    "in fact , the pcdc ( partially conserved dilatation current ) relation evaluated in the ladder approximation does not allow a very light td unless the td gets decoupled with divergent decay constant @xmath3  @xcite : the pcdc relation reads @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the trace of energy - momentum tensor . to this relation , the ladder estimate gives @xmath42 ( near the conformal window ) with @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "this simply implies that the limit @xmath44 , where the td gets light compared with the weak scale @xmath45 , can only be realized when @xmath46 , i.e. , a decoupled limit : @xmath47      as suggested earlier  @xcite , however , there is a potential problem in the ladder approximation about the mass of the td .",
    "actually , the ladder approximation totally ignores non - ladder dynamics , say , most notably the full gluonic dynamics . thus a possible way out would be to include fully _ nonperturbative gluonic dynamics_. ( also a direct estimate of @xmath3 free from the ladder approximation and without invoking the pcdc ( without referring to @xmath39 ) is necessary to give more implications of the td at the lhc . )",
    "one such a possibility besides lattice simulations would be a holographic computation based on the gauge - gravity duality  @xcite .",
    "we shall work on a recently proposed holographic model  @xcite , which is based on deformation of a bottom - up approach for successful holographic - dual of qcd  @xcite .",
    "the model describes a five - dimensional gauge theory having @xmath48 gauge symmetry , defined on the five - dimensional anti - de - sitter space with the fifth direction being compactified on a finite interval .",
    "in addition to a bulk scalar dual to the technifermion bilinear operator @xmath49 with the anomalous dimension @xmath0 , an extra bulk scalar field dual to technigluon condensate @xmath50 is incorporated   is actually necessary to properly reproduce the high energy behavior of vector / axial - vector current correlator including the gluon condensate term as predicted in the operator product expansion  @xcite . ] .    following the well - known holographic recipe",
    ", one can easily calculate the scalar ( or dilatation ) current correlator and examine the lowest pole identified as the td mass to get a formula in a light td limit : @xmath51 ( the details can be found in the published paper  @xcite . )",
    "this implies that , in contrast to the ladder approximation eq.([mtd : lad ] ) , the td can be as light as the 125 gev boson by a large gluonic effect @xmath52 : @xmath53 for the one - family model with @xmath54 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the gluonic effect in qcd is much smaller , @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "similarly , one can calculate the td decay constant @xmath3 by examining the pole residue of the dilatation current correlator to find a formula  @xcite : @xmath56 this and eq.([holo : formula ] ) indicate that , in contrast to the ladder approximation eq.([limit : lad ] ) , a very light / massless td with the finite decay constant @xmath3 can be realized when @xmath52 goes to infinity : @xmath57    the large @xmath52 limit actually corresponds to a  conformal \" limit where @xmath58 : combining eqs.([holo : formula ] ) and ( [ holo : formula:2 ] ) with the pcdc relation in eq.([pcdc ] ) and calculating the technigluon condensate @xmath59 , one can evaluate the beta function as a function of @xmath52 to find that @xmath60 as @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "thus the holographic estimate suggests that a very light td with the finite decay constant can be allowed due to the conformality tied with the nonperturbative gluonic effect @xmath52 .",
    "though this holographic result is strong enough to indicate the presence of the 125 gev td , we would anticipate that lattice simulations will give a more conclusive answer .",
    "below the technifermion mass scale @xmath62 tev ( see region iii in fig  .[alpha - beta ] ) , the wtc can be viewed as an effective technihadron model as in the qcd case .",
    "such an effective model will be described by a low - energy effective lagrangian based on nonlinear realization of both chiral and scale symmetries , involving the 125 gev td and the sm particles , which is most relevant for the lhc study  .",
    "the chiral / ew and scale invariant lagrangian thus takes the form  @xcite @xmath63 + { \\cal l}_{\\rm kin}(\\chi )   \\ , , \\label{inv : l}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is a nonlinear base of the scale symmetry , which parametrizes the td field @xmath65 with the decay constant @xmath3 and has the scale dimension 1 ; @xmath66 with the @xmath67 and @xmath68 gauge fields @xmath69 and @xmath70 ; @xmath71 denotes the scale invariant kinetic term of td and @xmath72 the usual chiral field parameterizing the ( eaten ) nambu - goldstone boson fields @xmath73 as @xmath74 ; the @xmath75 term gives the td couplings to massive weak bosons : @xmath76    as seen in eqs.([np : beta ] ) and ( [ np : sa ] ) , the scale symmetry is actually broken explicitly as well as spontaneously by dynamical mass generation of technifermions , which has to be respected also in the nonlinear realization  @xcite .",
    "such explicit breaking effects arise in the td yukawa couplings to the sm fermions , which reflect underlying etc - induced four - fermion terms , and couplings to qcd gluons and photons related to the scale anomaly in the sm gauge sector . in order to incorporate these effects into the scale - invariant lagrangian",

    "the td yukawa coupling to the sm @xmath85-fermion arises from the first line of eq.([lag : s ] ) as  @xcite @xmath86 along with scale dimension of technifermion bilinear operator @xmath87 .",
    "the anomalous dimension @xmath27 in wtc , which is crucial to obtain the realistic mass of the sm fermions of the first and the second generations without suffering from the flavor - changing neutral current problems .",
    "however it was known for long time that it is not enough for the mass of the third - generation sm @xmath85-fermions like @xmath88 : a simplest resolution would be the strong etc model  @xcite having much larger anomalous dimension @xmath89 due to the strong effective four - fermion coupling from the etc dynamics in addition to the walking gauge coupling . here",
    "we take @xmath90 2 , i.e. , @xmath91 , as in the strong etc model for the third - generation sm @xmath85-fermions like @xmath88 which are relevant to the current lhc data .",
    "we see from eqs.([td : ww ] ) and ( [ td : yukawa ] ) that the td couplings to @xmath69 and @xmath92 bosons and fermions are related to those of the sm higgs by a simple scaling : @xmath93 in addition to the above scaling , the couplings to gluon and photon ( @xmath94 and @xmath95 terms in eq.([lag : s ] ) ) involve the beta functions , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , induced from @xmath98-technifermion loops  @xcite .",

    "one could actually derive these td couplings directly from the ward - takahashi identities for the dilatation symmetry ( low - energy theorem )  @xcite .    as seen from eqs.([scaling ] ) and ( [ g - dip - dig ] ) , once the ratio @xmath102 is fixed , the td lhc phenomenological study can be made just by quoting the sm higgs coupling properties : we may estimate @xmath3 based on the ladder approximation  @xcite : the td decay constant @xmath3 can actually be related to the td mass @xmath39 through the pcdc  which is analogous to the pcac ( partially conserved axialvector current ) relation for the qcd pion  involving the vacuum energy density @xmath103 : @xmath104 the vacuum energy density @xmath103 is saturated by the technigluon condensation induced from the technifermion condensation , so is generically expressed as @xmath105 where @xmath106 denotes the dynamical technifermion mass and @xmath107 with @xmath108 being the number of ew doublets formed by technifermions and the number of dummy technifermions , @xmath109 , which are singlet under the sm gauges .",
    "the overall coefficient @xmath110 is determined once a straightforward nonperturbative calculation is made .",
    "the dynamical technifermion mass @xmath106 can , on the other hand , be related to the technipion decay constant @xmath19 : @xmath111 with the overall coefficient @xmath112 and the property of @xmath113 scaling taken into account .",
    "the values of @xmath110 and @xmath112 may be quoted from the latest result  @xcite on a ladder schwinger - dyson analysis for a modern version of wtc  @xcite : @xmath114 where @xmath112 has been estimated based on the pagels - stokar formula  @xcite . in that case",
    "@xmath13 is fixed by the criticality condition for the walking regime as  @xcite @xmath115 the estimated values in eqs.([kappas ] ) and ( [ criticality ] ) are based on ladder approximation which are subject to certain uncertainties up to 30% observed for the critical coupling and hadron spectrum in qcd  @xcite .",
    "we may include this 30% uncertainty in estimation of each independent factor @xmath110 , @xmath116 and the criticality condition @xmath117 .",
    "putting these all together , we thus estimate @xmath102 as @xmath118    alternatively , using the holographic estimate in eq.([holo : formula:2 ] ) and incorporating a typical @xmath11930% correction into the holography coming from the next - to - leading order terms in @xmath120 expansion , we may estimate the td decay constant @xmath3 to get  @xcite @xmath121 which is coincidentally consistent with the ladder estimate in eq.([vals ] ) .",
    "note that the two calculations are quite different qualitatively in a sense that the ladder calculation has no massless td limit , while the holographic model including the nonperturbative gluonic dynamics does .",
    "nevertheless , such a numerical coincidence may suggest that both models are reflecting some reality through similar dynamical effects for the particular mass region of the 125 gev td .      before proceeding to the lhc phenomenology , we shall briefly remark on stability of the light td mass against radiative corrections . as a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson of scale invariance ,",

    "the scale symmetry breaking in the ultraviolet region @xmath123 ( region i in fig .  [ alpha - beta ] ) has no problem thanks to the naturalness as usual like in the qcd and the qcd - scale - up tc where the theory has only logarithmic divergences . only possible source of the scale symmetry violation",
    "is from an effective theory for @xmath124 ( region iii in fig .",
    "[ alpha - beta ] ) .",
    "below @xmath125 the dominant corrections to the td mass @xmath39 come from the sm top quark loop   coupling could yield a similar correction to @xmath39 at one - loop level .",
    "this contribution , however , turns out to be negligible in magnitude compared to the top - loop correction in eq.([top - corr ] ) , due to the high suppression factor @xmath126  @xcite . ] , which can be estimated from the effective lagrangian in eqs.([inv : l ] ) and ( [ lag : s ] ) as @xmath127 where the cutoff has been set by @xmath106 . due to the large td decay constant @xmath128 ( see eq.([holo : prediction ] ) ) , this correction only gives a tiny shift to the 125 gev td mass ( note numerically @xmath129 ) : @xmath130 thus the 125 gev td mass is fully stable against the radiative corrections , in contrast to the unnatural sm higgs case .",
    "we now discuss the 125 gev td phenomenology at the lhc based on the coupling properties derived in the previous section .",
    "as is clear from eqs.([scaling ] ) and ( [ holo : prediction ] ) , the td couplings to the sm particles are simply suppressed by the large decay constant @xmath3 compared to the sm higgs case . as seen from eq.([g - dip - dig ] ) , however , the gluon - gluon fusion ( ggf ) and diphoton couplings can be enhanced due to extra contributions from technifermions in the one - family model which compensate the overall suppression by @xmath3 .",

    "<S> the technidilaton ( td ) is a composite scalar predicted in walking technicolor ( wtc ) , arising as a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson associated with the spontaneous breaking of the approximate scale invariance . due to the nambu - goldstone boson s nature </S>",
    "<S> , the td can be as light as the lhc boson that has been discovered at around 125 gev . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the size of the td mass and the coupling properties relevant to the lhc study . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the td couplings to the standard model ( sm ) particles take the same form as those of the sm higgs boson , except the essentially distinguishable two ingredients : i ) the overall coupling strengths set by the decay constant related to the spontaneous breaking of the scale invariance , which is in general not equal to the electroweak scale ; ii ) the couplings to photons and gluons which can include extra contributions from technifermion loops and hence can be enhanced compared to the sm higgs case . to be concrete , </S>",
    "<S> we take the one - family technicolor model to explore the td lhc phenomenology at 125 gev . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the td gives the signal consistent with the currently reported lhc data , notably can explain the excess in the diphoton channel , due to the extra contributions to digluon and diphoton couplings coming from the one - family technifermion loops . </S>"
