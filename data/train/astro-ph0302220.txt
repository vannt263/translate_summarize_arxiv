    "_ wmap _ has mapped the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropy over the full sky with unprecedented accuracy @xcite . the temperature angular power spectrum ( tt , * ? ? ? * ) and the temperature - polarization cross - power spectrum ( te , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) derived from those maps have a number of characteristic features .",
    "it is these features , and our ability to predict them , that make the anisotropy such a powerful tool for cosmology .",
    "computer programs like cmbfast @xcite efficiently compute the tt and te power spectra for a wide variety of cosmological parameters .",
    "the model spectra are then compared to the data to deduce the best fit parameters @xcite .",
    "the distinctiveness and accuracy of the measured spectrum determines the degree to which the parameters may be distinguished .",
    "while the parameters of cosmological models are ultimately found by maximizing the likelihood of the data given a model , and the validity of a model is assessed by the goodness of fit @xcite , this analysis by itself provides no model independent assessment of the features of the angular power spectrum . both intuition and calculational simplicity fall by the wayside . in this paper",
    "we focus on the peaks of the tt and te spectra .",
    "there are four reasons to consider just these particular characteristics .",
    "the first is that through an examination of the peaks , one can gain an intuition for how the cosmological parameters are encoded in the tt and te spectra .",
    "the second is that by determining how the peaks depend on cosmological parameters , one may quickly assess how potential systematic errors in the angular power spectra affect some of the cosmological parameters .",
    "the third is that alternative models , or additions to the best fit model , may be easily compared to the data simply by checking to see if the alternative reproduces the peak positions and amplitudes .",
    "finally , the peaks serve as a simple check for the sophisticated parameter fitting described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : background ] we give a brief overview of the cmb . in ",
    "[ sec : peakvals ] we give _ wmap _ s best fit values for the positions in @xmath15-space and amplitudes of the peaks .",
    "we then consider , in ",
    "[ sec : interp ] , the cosmological information that comes from the positions and amplitudes of the tt and te peaks .",
    "we interpret the peaks in terms of the best fit model to the full _ wmap _ data set @xcite and make direct connections to the decoupling epoch .",
    "we conclude in  [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "the cmb tt spectrum may be divided into three regions depending on the characteristic angular scale of its features . in each region , a different physical process dominates .",
    "the regions correspond to : ( a ) angular scales larger than the horizon size at decoupling as observed today .",
    "these correspond to @xmath16 or , equivalently @xmath17 .",
    "the low @xmath15 portion is termed the sachs - wolfe plateau @xcite . in this region",
    "one observes the relatively unprocessed primordial fluctuation spectrum because patches of sky with larger separations could not have been in causal contact at decoupling .",
    "( b ) the acoustic peak region , @xmath18 or @xmath19 , which is described by the physics of a 3000  k plasma of number density @xmath20 responding to fluctuations in the gravitational potential produced by the dark matter .",
    "( c ) the silk damping tail @xcite , @xmath21 or @xmath22 , which is produced by diffusion of the photons from the potential fluctuations and the washing out of the net observed fluctuations by the relatively large number of hot and cold regions along the line of sight . the basic framework in which to interpret the temperature anisotropy has been known for over thirty years @xcite .",
    "it has long been recognized that the positions and amplitudes of the peaks in the @xmath19 region could be used to constrain the cosmological parameters in a particular model @xcite .",
    "previous studies @xcite have steadily increased our understanding of the peaks and their significance .",
    "a summary of pre-_wmap _ determinations of the position and amplitude of the first peak is given in table 1 .",
    "we determine the peaks and troughs with fits of gaussian and parabolic functions to the data . through this process",
    ", we compress a large data set to eight numbers . such a compression is similar to specifying the cosmological parameters ; though , it is considerably easier to compute and directed more toward the intrinsic characteristics of the data as opposed to a cosmological model .    for the tt spectrum , @xmath23 , we model the spectrum for @xmath24 as composed of a gaussian peak , a parabolic trough , and a second parabolic peak independent of any particular cosmological model . using a parabola to fit the first peak results in a higher @xmath25 and",
    "systematically underestimates the amplitude .",
    "parabolas are adequate for the other features .",
    "the independent parameters are the amplitude and position of each peak and trough , the width of the first peak , and a continuity parameter .",
    "the latera recta the value of the latus rectum is @xmath26 .",
    "] of the trough and second peak are derived by constraining the model spectrum to be continuous .",
    "the junction between the first peak and the first trough ( first trough and second peak ) is fixed to be where the first peak ( first trough ) equals the continuity parameter .",
    "in other words , the continuity parameter is the value of the angular power spectrum where the curves meet .",
    "there are a total of eight parameters .",
    "we denote the positions of the first peak , first trough , and second peak as @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 respectively .",
    "the amplitudes of the first and second peak are @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the peak parameters are found in three ways : ( a ) with a direct non - linear fit based on the levenberg - marquardt algorithm @xcite ; ( b ) with a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) @xcite of the peak parameters ( not the cosmological parameters ) ; and ( c ) with peak - by - peak fits with a gaussian fitting function .",
    "we have also separately fit the first peak with a gaussian with additional parameters for kurtosis and skewness .",
    "all methods yield consistent results .",
    "the values we quote are from the mcmc .",
    "all fitting is done with the unbinned angular spectra using the full covariance matrix @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the year one _ wmap _ calibration uncertainty is 0.5% which is added in quadruture to the fitted peak amplitude uncertainty .",
    "the fit to the tt peak models yields a minimum @xmath33 . while not as good a fit to the data as a cmbfast - derived spectrum ,",
    "the determinations of the peaks are the same for all three methods and are consistent with those of the best fit cmbfast model .    for the te spectrum",
    "the data between @xmath34 are modeled as a piecewise - continous composite of a parabolic antipeak and parabolic peak .",
    "( we do not fit the reionization region , @xmath35 ) .",
    "each parabola has a latus rectum , height , and position ; however , the latus rectum of the antipeak is constrained by the requirement that the antipeak and peak are continuously joined at the zero - crossing .",
    "thus there are just five free parameters .",
    "we impose a prior on the latus rectum of the peak to be @xmath36 .",
    "the te fisher matrix depends on @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "the tt spectrum is fixed to be a best - fit model , and the small ee contribution is neglected .",
    "the best fit model spectrum has @xmath40 .",
    "the parameters are summarized in table  [ tab : peaks ] along with the peak positions determined directly from the mcmc method .",
    "these two completely distinct methods yield consistent results",
    ". figure  [ fig : peakfit ] shows the binned tt and te angular spectrum with the best fit peaks model and the @xmath10 and @xmath41 contours for the peak and trough positions .",
    "the amplitude of the tt trough and second peak are separated by @xmath42 , leaving no doubt of the existence of the second peak .    also shown in table  [",
    "tab : peaks ] are the peak determinations from the full analysis using just the _ wmap _ data @xcite .",
    "the agreement between the two is generally good , most of the values are within @xmath10 , all are within @xmath43 .",
    "this level of discrepancy is expected because the peak fitting and the full analysis weight the data in very different ways .",
    "we now interpret the peak characteristics in terms of a flat adiabatic @xmath11cdm cosmological model .",
    "we focus on the baryon density , @xmath44 , the matter density , @xmath45 ( @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the cold dark matter component ) , and the the slope of the primordial power spectrum , @xmath14 .",
    "the comparison of the peaks and troughs to the model is made at two levels . at the more general level",
    ", we use cmbfast to derive simple scaling relations and show how the cosmological parameters are encoded in the peak characteristics .",
    "the aim is to build an intuition for the connection between the raw data and the deduced parameters .",
    "this approach has been championed by @xcite ; this paper forms the basis for our presentation .",
    "the scaling relations hold for a wide range of parameters and may be derived without considering _ wmap _ data .",
    "however , we optimize them for the best fit _ wmap _ parameters ( table  [ tab : numvals ] ) , so they are as accurate as possible . at a more detailed level , we show that by using the peak values _ and _ uncertainties with the scaling relations , one obtains constraints and uncertainties on @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath14 , and the age of the universe that are consistent with the full analysis @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed that the physics of the acoustic peaks may be understood in terms @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath14 , @xmath50 ( the optical depth to when the universe was reionized ) , and @xmath51 ( the angular scale of the sound horizon at decoupling ) .",
    "our approach follows that of @xcite in that we consider just the positions of the peaks and the ratios of the peak amplitudes . for @xmath52 ,",
    "the peak ratios are insensitive to the intrinsic amplitude of the cmb spectrum and to @xmath50 .",
    "the free electrons from reionization at @xmath53 @xcite scatter cmb photons , thereby reducing the cmb fluctuations by nearly a constant factor for multipoles @xmath54 .",
    "( the reionization also increases the tt spectrum at @xmath35 due to doppler shifts of the scatterers . )",
    "we therefore consider just @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath14 , and @xmath51 , in the context of a flat @xmath11cdm model .",
    "the acoustic peaks arise from adiabatic compression of the photon - baryon fluid as it falls into preexisting wells in the gravitational potential .",
    "these potential wells are initially the result of fluctuations in some primordial field ( e.g. , the inflaton field in inflationary cosmology ) .",
    "the wells are enhanced by the dark matter ( @xmath47 ) , which is able to cluster following matter - radiation equality ( @xmath55 , table  [ tab : numvals ] ) because the dark matter , for our purposes , does not scatter off the photons or baryons .",
    "the first peak corresponds to the scale of the mode that has compressed once in the age of the universe at the time that the photons decoupled from the electrons at @xmath56 , some @xmath57 after the big bang @xcite .",
    "the characteristic angular scale of the peaks is set by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the comoving size of the sound horizon at decoupling and @xmath60 is the comoving angular size distance to the decoupling surface .",
    "the size of the sound horizon may be computed from the properties of a photon - baryon fluid in an expanding universe . at decoupling it",
    "is given by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* b6 ) : @xmath61 in mpc , where @xmath62 with @xmath63 the baryon density and @xmath64 the photon density .",
    "the redshift at matter - radiation equality is @xmath65 the ratio of neutrinos to photons is @xmath66 @xcite . note that @xmath67 depends only on the physical densities , @xmath49 and @xmath48 , and not on @xmath68 .",
    "( we assume @xmath69 @xcite and the number of neutrino species , @xmath70 . )",
    "also , @xmath59 is independent of the curvature and cosmological constant densities , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , because these are both late acting : at high @xmath73 the universe evolves as though it is geometrically flat .    the comoving angular size distance .",
    "common alternative names include `` proper motion distance '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , `` angular diameter distance '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , and `` transverse comoving distance '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . ] to the decoupling surface , @xmath60 , for a flat geometry is @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the current radiation density and @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "neither @xmath59 nor @xmath60 depend on @xmath14 .",
    "the picture one has is that of measuring the angular size @xmath51 of a physical meter stick of size @xmath59 near the edge of the observable universe with geodesics of the intervening geometry as encoded in @xmath60 .",
    "the position in @xmath15-space of the first peak is intimately linked to @xmath51 . in fact , in the full analysis @xcite , @xmath51 is one of the best determined fit parameters because of its association with the first peak . to make the connection",
    ", one defines a characteristic acoustic index , @xmath77 .",
    "however , @xmath78 is not @xmath27 because the potential wells that drive the compression , leading to the large variance at @xmath27 , are dynamic : they respond to the matter and radiation that falls into them .",
    "additionally , there is no precise physical relation between an angular scale and an associated @xmath15 .",
    "one calibrates the relation with cosmological models , such as those from cmbfast , to find a phase factor @xmath79 that relates the two @xcite .",
    "the general relation for all peaks and troughs is @xmath80 where @xmath81 labels the peak number ( @xmath82 for the first peak , @xmath83 for the first trough , etc . ) . for a particular curvature density , @xmath71 , the @xmath84 depend weakly on @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "for example , near the _ wmap _ values , changing @xmath14 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 by 10% changes @xmath79 by 4.6% , 0.5% , and 1.1% , respectively .",
    "because the @xmath84 differ by only @xmath85% between peaks , @xmath78 may be thought of as the characteristic scale of the peaks in @xmath15-space .",
    "effectively , the full analysis solves for the phase factors simultaneously with the other parameters .",
    "the considerations above are quite general and involve a good fraction of the quantities that are of interest to cosmologists .",
    "we now show how the _ wmap _ peak positions are related to , and in some cases determine , these quantities .",
    "the position of the first peak is an essential ingredient of the mixture of properties that make the cmb such a powerful probe of the geometry of the universe @xcite .",
    "however , the position alone does not determine the geometry . with the full tt spectrum , the quantities that _ wmap _ measures particularly well , independent of @xmath71 ,",
    "are @xmath49 and @xmath48 because both these quantities affect the spectrum at early times , before geometric effects shift the spectrum .",
    "even if @xmath49 and @xmath48 are known , @xmath71 and @xmath86 ( through @xmath68 ) may be traded off one another to give the same @xmath51 .",
    "this is called the `` geometric degeneracy '' @xcite .",
    "the degeneracy is broken with either prior knowledge of @xmath68 or @xmath86 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for _ wmap _ if we impose a prior constraint of @xmath87 then @xmath88 ; without the prior , @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "in the following , we take the geometry to be flat and therefore consider the peak positions as a function of @xmath48 , @xmath14 , and @xmath49 only .    with known @xmath48 and @xmath49",
    ", the acoustic horizon size @xmath59 is particularly well determined . from equation 2",
    "we find @xmath90mpc .",
    "when @xmath14 is included , we may in addition determine the phases .",
    "from the fits in @xcite we obtain @xmath91 .",
    "the uncertainty is derived from the uncertainties of @xmath14 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and the quoted accuracy of the fitting function .",
    "this combined with the measured position of the first peak at @xmath92 gives us an acoustic horizon scale of @xmath93 . and",
    ", from @xmath78 we find that @xmath94 .",
    "in other words , we know the angular and physical sizes of structures on the decouping surface very well . from equation",
    "[ eq : theta_s ] , we solve for the angular size distance and find that @xmath95 . if we had naively tried to compute @xmath60 from @xmath68 and @xmath86 and their uncertainties directly from equation  [ eq : add ] , the resulting uncertainty would have been larger .",
    "this , though , is not the correct procedure because the @xmath68 and @xmath86 deduced from the cmb are correlated as shown in figure  [ fig : h_vs_omm ] .",
    "the interplay between measuring the peak position , and thus @xmath60 , and measuring @xmath49 is at the root of _ wmap _ s ability to determine @xmath86 and @xmath68 separately @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite show that @xmath51 , which depends primarily on the first peak position , is the same along a line of constant @xmath96 .",
    "in other words , this is how @xmath86 and @xmath68 scale to keep @xmath51 constant . in figure  [ fig : h_vs_omm ] we show the constraint from the measured first peak position . for each coordinate pair in the plane",
    ", we compute @xmath27 from equations  [ eq : theta_s ] , [ eq : rss ] , [ eq : add ] , and [ eq : peak_phase ] and then assign the pair a likelihood derived from the measured distribution of @xmath92 .",
    "( we set @xmath97 for the calculation as discussed below . )",
    "the figure also shows the constraints from @xmath49 and the likelihood contours from the full _ wmap _ likelihood analysis .",
    "it is evident that the departure from a fixed @xmath13 dependence in @xmath51 enables separating @xmath86 and @xmath68 .",
    "the separation is by no means complete and constitutes one of the largest parameter degeneracy for _ wmap _ ; it precludes determining @xmath98 to high precision with cmb data alone .",
    "the independent determination of @xmath86 and @xmath68 will improve with time as the uncertainty on @xmath49 decreases .",
    "fortunately , galaxy surveys are sensitive to @xmath99 which breaks the degeneracy when the data sets are combined @xcite .",
    "it is fortuitous that in a flat geometry the position of the first peak is directly correlated with the age of the universe @xcite .",
    "this is seen most easily in the @xmath100 plane in figure  [ fig : h_vs_omm ] . with @xmath101 ,",
    "the age depends only on the expansion time scale @xmath102 and @xmath86 and is given by @xmath103 } \\label{eqn : t0}\\ ] ] @xcite .",
    "we show the isochrons for 12  gyr through 16  gyr .",
    "one observes that they overlap considerably with the position constraint and the degeneracy lines from equation  [ eq : add ] . for reasonable values of @xmath86 , the age",
    "is seen to be in the neighborhood of 13.6 gyr .",
    "the full analysis @xcite gives @xmath104 for @xmath101 .",
    "changing @xmath48 changes the position constraint through changes in @xmath59 and @xmath79 . if @xmath48 is increased from 0.024 to 0.025 ( @xmath10 ) , the position constraint line shifts by @xmath105 , indicating that the plot is not particularly sensitive to changes in @xmath48 .    to summarize this section ,",
    "we have shown how the position of the first peak is related to the cosmological parameters .",
    "traditionally , one has used equation  [ eq : peak_phase ] , the weak dependence of @xmath106 on @xmath48 and @xmath49 , @xmath107 and the measured position of the first peak to deduce flatness .",
    "instead , we assumed flatness and use _ wmap _ s values of @xmath14 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , to deduce a precise relation for the acoustic scale , @xmath78 .",
    "we then showed how one of the largest parameter degeneracy in the cmb data could be understood in terms trading off @xmath68 and @xmath86 in @xmath51 .",
    "finally , we showed that _",
    "s measure of the age of the universe is largely a function of _ wmap _ s identification of the position of the first peak .",
    "the scaling of the amplitude of the first peak with @xmath48 and @xmath49 has a straightforward interpretation .",
    "however , unlike the position , the amplitude itself has a complicated dependence on the cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "we defer discussing the @xmath48 scaling until after  [ sec : second_peak ] and consider here just the @xmath49 scaling .    increasing @xmath49 decreases the first peak height .",
    "when the universe is radiation dominated at @xmath108 and the photon - baryon fluid compresses in a gravitational potential well , the depth of the well is decreased due to the additional mass loading of the fluid . as a result , the compressed fluid can expand more easily because it sees a shallower potential .",
    "the process is termed `` radiation driving '' @xcite and enhances the oscillations .",
    "( in addition , a shallower potential well means that the photons are redshifted less as they climb out enhancing the effect further . )",
    "the effect remains important through recombination .",
    "increasing @xmath49 , while holding all else but @xmath72 constant , moves the epoch of matter - radiation equality to higher redshifts without significantly affecting @xmath56 .",
    "this gives the dark matter more time to develop the potential wells into which the photon - baryon fluid falls . with better defined potential wells ,",
    "the compressed photon - baryon fluid has less of an effect on them , thereby reducing the effects of radiation driving . as a consequence , increasing @xmath49 decreases the amplitude of the fluctuations for all the acoustic peaks .",
    "there is a pronounced second peak in the _ wmap _ tt spectrum at a height @xmath42 above the first trough .",
    "the peak arises from the rarefaction phase of an acoustic wave . in broad terms @xcite , in the same conformal time",
    "that it takes the plasma to compress over the acoustic horizon , an acoustic wave with half the wavelength ( twice the @xmath15 ) of the first peak can compress and rarify .",
    "likewise , a compressional third peak is expected at the second harmonic of the first peak and a rarefaction fourth peak is expected at the third harmonic of the first peak .",
    "this set of peaks , the first two of which _ wmap _ clearly sees , shows that the photon - baryon fluid underwent acoustic oscillations .",
    "the position of the first trough , and the second and subsequent peaks is predicted from the acoustic scale and phase shifts . from equation  ( [ eq : peak_phase ] ) and the values in table  [ tab : numvals ] ,",
    "one predicts @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 .",
    "the first two of these values agree with those found from the peak fits to within the measurement uncertainty as shown in table  [ tab : peaks ] .",
    "the amplitude of the second peak depends on many of the same parameters as the amplitude of the first .",
    "its most distinctive feature , though , is that increasing @xmath48 _ decreases _ its height .",
    "the reason is that as one increases the baryon density one increases the inertia in the photon - baryon fluid .",
    "when compared to the lower @xmath48 case , the compressions are deeper and the rarefactions not as pronounced .",
    "thus , the compressional peaks are hotter ( first and third ) and the rarefaction peaks ( second and fourth ) are cooler .",
    "following @xcite we characterize the amplitude of second peak as a ratio to the amplitude of the first peak , @xmath112 .",
    "the ratio is insensitive to the reionization optical depth and to the overall amplitude of the spectrum since they simply scale the amplitudes of both peaks .",
    "it depends on just @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath14 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath49 is relatively weak , since to a first approximation it too just scales the peak amplitudes as discussed above .",
    "the dependence on @xmath14 simply comes from the overall slope of the cmb angular spectrum . increasing @xmath14 increases the height of the second peak relative to the first .",
    "the following function is derived from fitting to a grid of cmbfast spectra .",
    "it gives the ratio of the peak amplitudes to @xmath113% accuracy for 50% variations in the parameters : @xmath114 the parameter dependences are @xmath115 thus a 1% increase in both @xmath48 and @xmath49 with @xmath14 fixed reduces the height of the second peak relative to the first by 0.63% .",
    "for the _ wmap _ data , @xmath116 . in figure",
    "[ fig : n_wb_wc ] we show the constraints from @xmath117 for @xmath118 .",
    "the contour lines correspond to the full analysis @xcite .",
    "one sees that the two analyses are consistent , though the error from just considering @xmath117 is larger .",
    "however , it is clear that the uncertainty in @xmath112 for @xmath48 at fixed @xmath14 and @xmath49 leads to nearly the same uncertainty as deduced from the full analysis .",
    "thus , we may interpret _ wmap _ s ability to determine @xmath48 as coming primarily from the precise measurement of the ratio of the first two peaks .",
    "the first two terms on the right side of the above equation , as shown in figure  [ fig : n_wb_wc ] , also quantify the @xmath119 degeneracy @xcite .",
    "the height of the third peak _ increases _ as @xmath48 increases , as discussed above , and increasing @xmath49 decreases its height .",
    "thus the ratio to the first peak is not as distinctive as for the second peak in terms of @xmath48 and @xmath49 but the long @xmath15 baseline makes the ratio more sensitive to @xmath14 . @xcite",

    "measuring the third peak helps mostly in measuring @xmath14 , thereby breaking the @xmath119 degeneracy shown in the left side of figure  [ fig : n_wb_wc ] . for _ wmap _ parameters , equation  [ eq : h3tt ] is accurate to 1% .    _",
    "wmap _ does not yet clearly measure the third peak . for its height",

    "though not quite at the peak , the value is sufficient . with _ wmap _",
    "s first peak , @xmath124 .",
    "the e - mode polarization in the cmb arises from thompson scattering of a quadrupolar radiation pattern at the surface of last scattering . at decoupling ,",
    "the quadrupolar pattern is produced by velocity gradients in the plasma and is correlated with the temperature anisotropy @xcite . in rough terms , because it is velocity dependent , the temperature - polarization correlation traces the derivative of the temperature spectrum . for a given tt spectrum , the ( non - reionized )",
    "te and ee spectra are predicted .",
    "thus , their observation confirms that the cosmological model is correct but in so far as they are predicted for @xmath52 , they contain little additional information about the parameters .",
    "by contrast , the te polarization signal at @xmath35 @xcite , produced by reionized electrons scattering the local @xmath125 cmb quadrupole , breaks a number of parameter degeneracies and considerably enhances the ability to extract the cosmic parameters .    from parameterizing the output of cmbfast",
    ", we find that the ratio of the first te antipeak to the second te peak is given by @xmath126 the parameter dependencies are @xmath127 the sign preceding @xmath128 is opposite to that in the case of the tt peaks since we are considering the ratio of the first antipeak ( low @xmath15 ) to the second peak ( high @xmath15 ) , whereas in the case of the tt peaks we were considering the second peak ( high @xmath15 ) to the first peak ( low @xmath15 ) . here ,",
    "increasing @xmath49 _ increases _ the contrast between the te peak and antipeak .",
    "this occurs because increasing @xmath49 leads to deeper potential wells at decoupling . in turn",
    ", this produces higher velocities and thus an enhanced polarization signal . from the data we find @xmath129 .",
    "we now use the scaling relations just presented in a flat model with the scalar index limited to @xmath130 .",
    "this simplified minimal model leads to a greater intuition for assessing the peaks role in determining the cosmological parameters .",
    "the constraints from @xmath112 and @xmath131 are shown in figure  [ fig : n_wb_wc ] .",
    "we see that @xmath112 determines @xmath48 for most values of the dark matter and that @xmath132 ( 2@xmath133 ) regardless of the amount of dark matter .",
    "the width of the swath is about twice that of the formal error , again indicating that more in the spectrum than just @xmath112 constrains @xmath48 .",
    "the constraints from @xmath134 and @xmath131 are almost orthogonal to the @xmath112 constraint but their uncertainty bands are wide .",
    "this shows us that the _ wmap _ value for @xmath47 ( or @xmath49 ) is not being driven specifically by the peak ratios .",
    "rather , the constraint comes from the amplitude of the whole spectrum .",
    "the degeneracy with @xmath50 is broken by the te detection of reionization and the degeneracy with the overall amplitude is broken because @xmath49 affects primarily the acoustic peak region more than the low @xmath15 part of the spectrum .",
    "we have focused on the dominant acoustic features in the _ wmap _ spectrum , but there are other features as well .",
    "notable by its absence is a trough in the tt spectrum at @xmath135 due to the increase in fluctuation power near @xmath136 from the integrated sachs - wolfe effect in a @xmath11-dominated universe .",
    "this feature is largely obscured by cosmic variance . for _ wmap",
    "_ though , there is very little power at low @xmath15 and the correlations with @xmath137 are unusually small @xcite .",
    "the lack of even a hint of an upturn at low @xmath15 , in the context of @xmath11cdm models , is surprising .",
    "( however , _",
    "cobe _ also found no evidence for such an upturn ) .",
    "this departure from the model constitutes a small ( though possibly important ) fraction of the total fluctuation power and does not cast doubt on the interpretation of the @xmath52 spectrum .    at @xmath138 and @xmath139 ,",
    "for example , there are excursions from a smooth spectrum that are somewhat larger than expected statistically .",
    "while intriguing , they may result from a combination of cosmic variance , subdominant astrophysical processes , and small effects from approximations made for the year one data analysis @xcite . at present",
    ", we consider them interesting but do not attach cosmological significance to them ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more integration time and more detailed analyses are needed to understand how they should be interpreted .    in summary ,",
    "the characteristics of the peaks of the _ wmap _ angular power spectra may be robustly extracted from the data .",
    "the second tt peak is seen with high accuracy ; the te antipeak and peak have been observed for the first time . in the context of a flat adiabatic @xmath11cdm model , which fits the _ wmap _ data well , we report the characteristics of the decoupling surface . by considering a reduced parameter space ,",
    "we show how the position of the first peak leads to _ wmap _ s tight determination of the age of the universe and how @xmath48 is determined primarily from the amplitude ratio of the first to second tt peak .",
    "the determination of @xmath49 comes from considering the full data set and is not attributable to any particular peak ratio .",
    "lp is grateful to viatcheslav mukhanov for helpful discussions on the parameter dependences of the peaks during his year at princeton and to alessandro melchiorri for discussing his work on peaks prior to publication .",
    "lp especially thanks toby marriage for many enlightening discussions on the first peak .",
