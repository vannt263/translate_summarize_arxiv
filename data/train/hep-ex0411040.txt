    "deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) has long been used to measure the structure of hadrons .",
    "measurements with a fixed target helped establish the quark parton model and the theory of the strong force , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "hera , being the first colliding beam dis experiment , enables proton structure to be measured in hitherto unexplored regions .",
    "the measurements of proton structure at hera , particularly at very low fractional parton momentum , have yielded extremely precise parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , essential for making qcd predictions at present and future hadron colliders .    in the years 19982000",
    "hera was operated in both @xmath5 and @xmath6 scattering modes at a centre of mass energy of @xmath7  gev .",
    "the large data samples collected has allowed a determination of all the possible neutral current ( nc , @xmath8 ) structure functions @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the first time at hera . the structure function @xmath0 is sensitive to all quark species and dominates the cross section throughout the accessible phase space .",
    "the quantity @xmath2 is sensitive to the valence quarks . since the cross section only becomes sensitive to @xmath2 via the exchange of the @xmath9 boson , its influence is limited to the very high @xmath10 electroweak regime .",
    "finally , @xmath1 is sensitive to higher order gluon radiation processes providing valuable confirmation of the gluon content of the proton .    like the neutral current cross section",
    ", the charged current ( cc , @xmath11 ) cross section is an important tool to measure the structure of the proton , particularly since the charged current process is sensitive to the quark flavour decomposition of the proton .",
    "measurements of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 scattering cross sections have allowed independent determination of the @xmath12 quark and @xmath13 densities . in the years 2003 - 2004",
    "hera operated in @xmath5 mode with longitudinally polarised @xmath14 beam , allowing the dependence of the cc cross section on polarisation to be measured for the first time .",
    "the structure functions are usually presented in terms of the kinematic variables bjorken @xmath15 , the fraction of the proton s momentum carried by the struck quark and @xmath10 the negative square of the 4-momentum transfer of the exchanged boson .",
    "@xmath10 may be interpreted as the resolving power of the exchange , with increasing @xmath10 able to resolve smaller distances within the proton .",
    "they may be derived from the differential cross sections as    @xmath16 \\label{eqn : sf}\\ ] ]    here @xmath17 is the electromagnetic coupling constants and @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "a similar relationship holds for cc interactions  @xcite .",
    "from the hera collaborations and fixed target experiments . the data are plotted as a function of @xmath15 for various fixed values of @xmath10 . also included",
    "are the results of a nlo qcd fit to the data .",
    "[ fig : f2x ] _ , width=434 ]    the large integrated luminosity achieved by hera in the last few years has provided data samples of several million events for nc measurements at low @xmath15 and low @xmath10 .",
    "this has allowed the determination of the proton structure function @xmath0 to an accuracy of @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "example measurements of @xmath0 from hera and fixed target experiments are shown in figure  [ fig : f2x ] .",
    "@xmath0 , which is sensitive to the total quark density of the proton , is seen to rise steeply as @xmath15 decreases .",
    "the data are compared to a next to leading order ( nlo ) quantum - chromodynamics ( qcd ) fit , which describes all data for @xmath21  gev very well .",
    "it may also be seen in figure  [ fig : f2x ] that the rise towards lower @xmath15 becomes more pronounced as @xmath10 increases . in order to explore this feature more quantitatively @xmath0",
    "is parameterised as @xmath22 and the slope parameter @xmath23 is plotted as a function of @xmath10 in figure  [ fig : lammergez ] . for @xmath24  gev it can be seen that @xmath23 increases .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that as @xmath10 increases the resolving power of the probe increases and more and more splitting processes of the form @xmath25 are resolved .",
    "the components after the spitting carry less momentum and so are observed at lower @xmath15 . at @xmath26 gev the data tend to reach a constant value for @xmath23 . in this region",
    "the data are difficult to describe using perturbative qcd although non - perturbative models do have some success  @xcite .     where the @xmath0 is parameterised as @xmath22 . , width=302 ]    it is also interesting to plot @xmath0 as a function of @xmath10 at fixed @xmath15 as shown in figure  [ fig : f2andglu].(a ) .",
    "if the proton were made solely of 3 quarks @xmath0 should remain constant or scale with @xmath10 .",
    "what is seen is negative scaling violations at large @xmath15 , approximate scaling at @xmath27 and very large positive scaling violations at low @xmath15 . in qcd",
    "these scaling violations are interpreted as gluon radiation . as @xmath10 increases",
    "there is an increasing chance that a valence quark radiates a gluon and so decreasing the quark density at higher @xmath15 .",
    "conversely at lower @xmath15 there is an increased chance of a radiated gluon splitting into a quark pair so the density increases .",
    "nlo qcd theory shows that the gluon density is related to the differential of @xmath0 : @xmath28 .",
    "such a determination has been performed and the results are shown in figure  [ fig : f2andglu].(b ) .",
    "similar scaling violations are observed to the quark density of the proton .",
    "the structure function @xmath1 has not been directly determined at hera since a run taken at lower beam energies has not yet been performed .",
    "the data , however , are sensitive to @xmath1 at high @xmath29 as can be seen by examining equation  [ eqn : sf ] .",
    "h1 have used the approach that since @xmath0 is well determined over a wide range of @xmath15 and @xmath10 it may be extrapolated into the region at high @xmath29 using the qcd fit @xcite .",
    "thus , by subtracting a term that depends on @xmath0 and making a very small correction for @xmath2 one may determine @xmath1 .",
    "such a determination is shown in figure  [ fig : fl ] for various different @xmath10 and @xmath15 for a fixed @xmath30 .",
    "measurements from the @xmath5 data and the @xmath6 data are shown .",
    "it can be seen that the data are inconsistent with either @xmath31 or @xmath32 .",
    "the nlo qcd fit shows good agreement to the data .",
    "this is an important test of qcd since @xmath1 only arises through higher order corrections .",

    "although the errors on the first measurement are large it shows that the method works and reduced errors may be possible with high luminosity hera ii running .",
    "the nc and cc single differential cross sections @xmath34 at high @xmath10 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hiq2a ] for both @xmath5 and @xmath6 scattering @xcite .",
    "the nc data are seen to fall with the typical @xmath35 behaviour as expected for a photon propagator .",
    "the cc cross section is suppressed at low @xmath10 due to the large @xmath36 boson mass . at @xmath37",
    "the cross sections become comparable as expected from the unification of the electroweak force .",
    "the measurements are compared to a nlo qcd fit which provides a good description of the data .",

    ", width=491 ]    the combination of four cross sections , nc and cc in both @xmath5 and @xmath6 scattering , allows the flavour separation of the proton to be achieved with minimal assumptions using hera data alone for the first time .",
    "nlo qcd fits have been made by both collaborations to this data taking into account experimental and theoretical uncertainties @xcite .",
    "zeus include their jet data in order to reduce uncertainties particularly in the medium x region ( @xmath41 ) , where the hera inclusive data do not constrain the gluon very precisely .",
    "the results of these fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hiq2b ] for the @xmath12 and @xmath13 valence quark densities @xmath42 , @xmath43 ; the sea quark density @xmath44 and the gluon density @xmath45 . the results of the two fits agree well .",
    "the cross section measurements has been improved through a reduction of the systematic uncertainties which dominate the nc measurement up to @xmath46  gev@xmath47 .",
    "the double differential nc cross section now has a total systematic uncertainty of typically about @xmath48 compared to @xmath49 previously .",
    "this reduction in the systematic uncertainty has allowed the @xmath12 density to be determined to a precision of typically @xmath48 , and the @xmath13 density with a precision of @xmath50 at @xmath51 .",
    "from equation  [ eqn : sf ] it can be seen that the structure function @xmath2 may be measured by subtracting the @xmath5 nc data from the @xmath6 data .",
    "although @xmath2 only becomes a non - negligible part of the cross section at large @xmath10 when @xmath52 there are now enough statistics for a first measurement from hera .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : xf3 ] .",
    "the structure function @xmath2 is particularly important because it is only sensitive to the valence quarks . the measurements from hera show good agreement to the nlo qcd fit .",
    "the excess seen at low @xmath15 is not significant due to the relatively large errors on the data at the moment .    .",

    "this enables longitudinal polarisation of the @xmath14 beam .",
    "the first measurements @xcite of the cc cross section as a function of polarisation ( @xmath53 ) are shown in figure  [ fig : polcc ] .",
    "it is seen that the cross section is smaller for negative polarisation than for positive . in the standard model , due to the absence of right handed charged currents",
    ", it is expected that the cc cross section follows a linear dependence , with zero expectation at @xmath54 .",
    "the standard model agrees well with the data .",
    "there have been 2 methods employed at hera to extract the charm and beauty structure functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the proton .",
    "the first method is to tag charm by reconstructing @xmath55 mesons .",
    "this method results in a clean high statistics event sample and has been used by h1 and zeus to measure @xmath3 over the range @xmath56  @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the drawback of this method is that only a small fraction of charm events are seen and model dependent corrections must be employed to correct for unseen phase space , particularly at low transverse momentum of the @xmath55 , in order to extract @xmath3 . in the second method charm and",
    "beauty events are distinguished from each other and from the light quarks by measuring the displacement of tracks from the primary vertex  @xcite .",
    "the longer lived heavy hadrons produce tracks with significant displacements from the primary vertex , while the light hadrons usually decay so fast that the tracks are produced at the primary vertex .",
