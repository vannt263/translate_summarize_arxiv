    "qkd allows two distant parties , alice and bob , to generate a secret key ( unknown to a potential eavesdropper , eve ) over insecure quantum and classical channels . in discrete - variable ( dv ) qkd systems",
    "the key information is encoded on the properties of single photons , and detection is realized by single - photon detectors e.g. , @xcite . in cv - qkd",
    "the key information is encoded on the quadrature variables of the optical field , and detection is realized by high - efficiency homodyne ( or heterodyne ) detection techniques e.g. , @xcite .",
    "qkd schemes are mostly implemented based on point - to - point protocols where alice encodes the key information onto quantum states which are then transmitted over an unsecured quantum channel . at the output of the channel bob receives and measures the incoming states to infer the information of the sender .",
    "the secure key rate of point - to - point qkd is highly dependent on the devices utilized at the sender and receiver stations , particularly the measurement devices .",
    "unfortunately , practical detectors are not perfect and their inherent flaws can become the attack focus of an adversary @xcite . to alleviate this concern mdi protocols have been proposed @xcite . in mdi protocols both trusted ( legitimate )",
    "parties transmit quantum states to a third party ( assumed untrustworthy ) who realizes the measurements .",
    "the measurement outcomes will then be used by the legitimate users to establish secure keys independent of the measurement device .",
    "such procedures are particularly useful in relay systems , where due to channel issues an intermediate relay _ must _ be used to complete the communication link .",
    "mdi protocols have been well analyzed in theory @xcite , and experimentally demonstrated with dv systems @xcite and cv systems @xcite .",
    "previous works on mdi protocols have largely focussed on fixed - attenuation channels such as optical fiber @xcite . in the deployment of qkd between two remote ground stations",
    "a viable option could be the use of an mdi protocol with a low - earth orbit ( leo ) satellite realizing the measurement .",
    "however , the turbulent atmosphere between ground and satellite leads to a fading channel , whose nature of course is radically different from the fixed - attenuation channel .",
    "also , the atmospheric fading channel typically incurs very high loss rates .",
    "this is somewhat of a concern for the implementation of a mdi protocol since previous works on fixed - attenuation channels clearly demonstrate the non - viability of such a protocol in the high - loss regime .",
    "thus , in terms of the quantum key rates , it remains unclear if the atmospheric - fading channels can lead to an effective implementation of a mdi protocol .",
    "it is the main purpose of this work to provide a quantitative assessment , in terms of the resulting key rates , of a cv - mdi protocol over atmospheric - fading channels . among the many contributors to the transmission fluctuation in earth - to - satellite communications",
    ", we will focus here only on the fluctuations caused by beam wandering - the largest contributor @xcite .",
    "we will analyze the security of our mdi protocol through the use of an equivalent entanglement - based swapping scheme e.g. , @xcite . in doing this",
    "we will utilize some of our own previous work on the gaussian entanglement produced by entanglement swapping over atmospheric channels@xcite .",
    "our key aim is to compare the performance ( in terms of the resultant key rates ) of our cv - mdi protocol implemented over atmospheric - fading channels to the corresponding cv - mdi protocol over fixed - attenuation channels .",
    "we will also explore the cost , in the context of quantum key rates , of moving from the usual mode of assuming a trustworthy satellite to the mdi mode of assuming an untrustworthy satellite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , our cv - mdi protocol is described in detail . in section iii ,",
    "the simulation results on the performance of the protocol over the atmospheric - fading channels are presented and discussed .",
    "our conclusions are provided in section iv .",
    "we now describe the implementation of a cv - mdi protocol and outline how to determine the quantum key rates of this protocol for the atmospheric channel .",
    "let us first introduce some notation on cv states we will need for our discussions of the mdi protocol . for a single bosonic mode with annihilation and creation operators @xmath0 , the quadrature operators @xmath1 are defined by @xmath2 which satisfy the commutation relation @xmath3 = 2i$ ] ( here @xmath4 ) .",
    "the vector of quadrature operators for a quantum state with @xmath5 modes can be defined as @xmath6 .",
    "similarly , @xmath7 is defined for the corresponding quadrature variables .",
    "gaussian states are completely characterized by the first moment of the quadrature operators @xmath8 and a covariance matrix ( cm ) @xmath9 , i.e. a matrix of the second moments of the quadrature operators , which can be written as @xmath10 by local unitary operators , the first moment of every two - mode gaussian state can be set to zero and the cm can be transformed into the following standard form @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is a @xmath15 identity matrix .    in a typical point - to - point qkd protocol",
    "two distant trusted parties , alice and bob , first create two sets of correlated data by exchanging quantum states over an unsecured quantum channel . in a prepare - and - measure ( pm )",
    "scheme alice is the sender who prepares the quantum states and bob is the receiver who measures the incoming quantum states .",
    "following the steps of reconciliation and privacy amplification over a public ( but authenticated ) classical channel , alice and bob can subsequently generate a secret key even in the presence of eve . in this work",
    "we will largely focus on the cv - mdi protocol @xcite whose sources are gaussian states , experimentally demonstrated over free - space ( non - fading ) channels @xcite .",
    "the cv - mdi protocol in the pm scheme proceeds as follows:_preparation : _ if squeezed states represent the initial quantum resource , alice ( bob ) prepares mode  @xmath16 @xmath17 ( mode  @xmath18 @xmath19 ) in a squeezed state with cm @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , and where @xmath22 is the single - mode squeezing .",
    "the squeezed quadrature of mode  @xmath16 ( mode  @xmath18 ) is then modulated by a random gaussian - distributed variable with zero mean and variance @xmath23 such that @xmath24 .",
    "we will assume modes  @xmath16 and @xmath18 are modulated by the same but independent gaussian distributions .",
    "choosing to squeeze either the @xmath25 or @xmath26 quadrature is based on a random bit generated at alice and bob s side .",
    "if coherent states represent the initial quantum resource , alice ( bob ) prepares mode  @xmath16 @xmath17 ( mode  @xmath18 @xmath19 ) in a coherent state , where each quadrature of mode  @xmath16 and mode  @xmath18 are independently modulated by a random gaussian - distributed variable with zero mean and variance @xmath27 . _",
    "transmission : _ alice and bob transmit modes  @xmath16 and @xmath18 over the insecure lossy channels to the untrusted relay . _",
    "measurement : _ a cv bell measurement is performed on the incoming modes @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( where the @xmath30 indicates that the states have now incurred losses ) , which means modes @xmath28 and @xmath29 are combined on a balanced beam splitter whose output ports are conjugately homodyned . as a result ,",
    "the quadrature operators @xmath31 and @xmath32 are measured by the two homodyne detectors , and the classical measurement outcomes @xmath33 with probability @xmath34 are then communicated over a public channel to alice and bob .",
    "then bob modifies his data based on the bell measurement outcomes , while alice keeps her data unchanged . as a result ,",
    "the mutual information between alice and bob becomes nonzero , and a correlation is created between the two parties . as the relay may be controlled by eve , she does know the measurement results , however , this knowledge would not help her extract precise information on alice and bob s encodings .",
    "_ post - processing : _ after the establishment of a sufficiently large amount of correlated data , alice and bob proceed with the classical post - processing over an authenticated public channel which starts by applying sifting process ( no sifting is needed when the two partners prepare the coherent states ) and continues with parameter estimation , information reconciliation and privacy amplification to distill a secret key .",
    "the reconciliation can be performed in two ways ; either alice s data or bob s data are the reference .",
    "any false reporting of the bell measurement results by the relay will be readily detected in the post - processing phase .",
    "although the cv - mdi protocol is practically implemented in a pm scheme , we will study the protocol in an equivalent entanglement - based ( eb ) scheme that invokes cv - entanglement swapping at the satellite .",
    "in the eb scheme , a pair of two - mode squeezed vacuum ( tmsv ) states @xmath35 and @xmath36 with the same two - mode squeezing @xmath37 are initially owned by alice and bob respectively , where indices  @xmath38 indicate the modes .",
    "let us consider the initial two - mode gaussian entangled states @xmath35 and @xmath36 having zero mean and cm of the following form @xmath39 where @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the quadrature variance of each mode .",
    "modes  1 and 4 are held by alice and bob , while modes  2 and 3 are transmitted towards the intermediate relay over the insecure lossy channels with transmissivities of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively . assuming the fixed values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the received states at the relay , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , are still gaussian , and described with cms @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the excess noise contributions assumed to be independent of the channel loss . in implementations of cv - mdi qkd",
    ", excess noise generally comes from the two sources ; quantum state preparation at the transmitters ( laser s phase noise and imperfections in the modulation ) , and bell measurement at the receiver ( electronic noise and imperfections in the homodyne detectors ) .",
    "we will assume the transmitter noise is negligible relative to the receiver noise .",
    "the received modes  @xmath49 and @xmath50 are swapped via a bell measurement at the intermediate relay , where the modes  @xmath49 and @xmath50 are combined in a balanced beam - splitter , yielding output modes  @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "then , the new quadratures @xmath53 and @xmath54 are measured by two homodyne detectors , providing the classical outcomes @xmath55 with probability @xmath56 .",
    "the swapping process continues with the relay communicating the bell measurement results through a classical public channel to alice and bob .",
    "after the swapping process the cm of the conditional gaussian state @xmath57 shared between alice and bob can be obtained @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 . after receiving the bell measurement outcomes ,",
    "bob displaces mode  4 and obtains mode  @xmath60 , while alice keeps mode  1 unchanged .",
    "then alice and bob measure modes  1 and @xmath60 by homodyne ( or heterodyne ) detectors to create correlated data .",
    "after the establishment of a sufficiently large amount of correlated data , alice and bob proceed with the classical postprocessing over an authenticated public channel to create a secret key .",
    "( see appendix for more details . ) in the eb scheme of the cv - mdi protocol , if alice ( bob ) applies a homodyne detection on mode @xmath61 ( mode @xmath62 ) of the initial tmsv state @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) , the prepared state in its equivalent pm scheme is a squeezed state on mode @xmath63 ( mode @xmath64 ) , whose squeezed quadrature is modulated by a random gaussian distributed variable of zero mean and variance @xmath24 .",
    "if alice ( bob ) applies a heterodyne detection on mode  1 ( mode 4 ) , the prepared state in its equivalent pm scheme is a coherent state on mode  2 ( mode 3 ) , whose both quadratures are independently modulated by a random gaussian - distributed variable of zero mean and variance @xmath65 .",
    "note that these homodyne and heterodyne detections by alice and bob in the eb scheme can be postponed to after the bell measurement at the relay since the local measurements commute . in the protocol of coherent states ,",
    "the displacement variance @xmath27 is the result of a feasible modulation , hence @xmath27 can reach high values , for instance @xmath66 @xcite . on the contrary , in the protocol of squeezed states , high values of squeezing",
    "are experimentally challenging to achieve , hence the value of @xmath67 and also @xmath23 is practically limited .",
    "for example , @xmath68 is equivalent to the two - mode squeezing of 10db ( the state - of - the - art vacuum squeezing for the tmsv state ) .      having the conditional gaussian state with the cm in the form of eq .  , we are able to analytically compute the key rate @xmath69 of the protocol in bits per pulse , under the assumption of gaussian attacks by eve @xcite",

    "note that @xmath127 allows us to parameterize the difference between the two fading uplinks in terms of the geometry , such as the distance from each ground station to the satellite .",

    "1(a ) has only been plotted for the case where alice s data are the reference of reconciliation ; however , in the symmetric setting , where the two fading channels are characterized with the same probability density distribution , the key rate is always the same no matter whose data is the reference of reconciliation .",
    "we also simulate the performance of the cv - mdi protocol over the fixed - attenuation channels in relation to the fading channels . in order to make a valid comparison",

    "1(b ) shows the key rate ( in bits per pulse ) over the fixed - attenuation channels as a function of total channel losses , i.e. , @xmath141 with all the settings and parameters being the same as the corresponding protocols in fig .",
    "the main point we wish to draw from these results is while the cv - mdi protocol is only feasible over low - loss fixed - attenuation channels , the same protocol is able to achieve positive key rates over high - loss fading channels .",

    "it is perhaps interesting to compare our cv - mdi protocol with a scheme in which the satellite acts as a reflecting relay ( trustworthy relay ) .",
    "this scheme referred to as the _ direct transmission scheme _ has been studied in our previous work @xcite in terms of gaussian entanglement generation . in this scheme ,",
    "alice initially possesses a tmsv state , where one mode is held by alice , and the other mode is transmitted towards bob via a reflecting satellite over two independent fading channels . after the distribution of entanglement ,",
    "alice and bob can proceed with cv - qkd by applying homodyne ( or heterodyne ) detections to their own modes . in the typical point - to - point cv - qkd",
    ", the reverse reconciliation ( rr ) scenario always leads to higher key rates than the direct reconciliation ( dr ) scenario @xcite .",
    "hence , we only consider the rr scenario where bob s data is the reference of reconciliation . we again consider the symmetric setting , i.e. , @xmath134 , and the same type of detection by the trusted parties .",
    "1(a ) also shows the key rate of the direct transmission scheme for two types of detection , homodyne detection and heterodyne detection , as a function of the total mean fading losses .",
    "note that for these calculations the value of the quadrature variance is @xmath135 , and the value of the excess noise ( the receiver noise at bob s station ) is chosen the same as that in the cv - mdi protocol .",
    "these results , as expected , illustrate that the mdi protocol is not as effective as the direct transmission scheme in terms of the quantum key rates .",
    "the difference in the key rates shown between the direct transmission protocol and the mdi protocol simply illustrates the cost in moving from a trustworthy relay to an untrustworthy relay .    we have also simulated the performance of the mdi protocol in the more generic asymmetric settings anticipated for satellite communications ( i.e. one link has less fading loss than the other ) . for such circumstances ,",

    "2 we can see that the impact of the geometry is very small , with the key rate improvement only at about @xmath143 at low losses and almost negligible at the higher losses of 25 - 30db .",

    "thus far we have assumed a perfect reconciliation , @xmath146 .",
    "the lower curves of fig .  2 show the anticipated key rates for a realistic high ( but achievable ) value of @xmath147 , and for comparison an inefficient value @xmath148 .",
    "these results indicate the importance of efficient classical codes ( such as well - designed ldpc codes ) in the reconciliation phase .",
    "the results shown in figs .  1 - 2 can be translated into rates per second after multiplication by the anticipated pulse generation rate .",
    "pulse rates of order 100mhz can be anticipated by state - of - the - art systems . the average key rate , of course ,",
    "must be determined through a weighted integration over all possible geometrical configurations . however , from the results presented in figs .  1 - 2",
    "we already see that , dependent on the scheme adopted and on the actual loss rates , quantum key rates in the range of up to a few kbit / s can be anticipated for space - based implementations of the mdi protocol .    at the cost of additional complexity at the satellite , other variants of the mdi paradigm",
    "are possible .",
    "for example , inclusions of non - gaussian operations at the relay , such as a single - photon subtraction from each incoming pulse , prior to the bell measurement could be invoked .",
    "such photonic subtraction would generate a conditional state between alice and bob that would be non - gaussian in nature , possibly possessing enhanced entanglement - and therefore leading to higher key rates .",
    "our preliminary analysis of such a single - photon subtraction scheme appears to indicate that higher key rates will not be forthcoming - largely because of the low probabilities associated with the photon subtraction procedure .",

    "it is certainly not impossible that the quantum key generation rates presented here can be significantly improved upon if more sophisticated quantum operations are possible on board the satellite .",
    "in this work we have explored a cv - based mdi protocol for two terrestrial stations communicating via an untrustworthy leo satellite . in terms of the quantum key rates",

    "can be inserted into a global unitary operator @xmath158 .",
    "thus , the probability @xmath159 of all the measurement outcomes @xmath160 is given by @xmath161 substituting @xmath162 of eq .   into eq .",
    ", we will have @xmath163 the bell measurement result @xmath164 is then communicated to alice and bob . according to the result @xmath164 , bob modifies his data @xmath152 by @xmath165 , where @xmath127 is the gain factor in the modified pm scheme .",
    "however , alice keeps her data unchanged , i.e. , @xmath166 .",
    "thus , the probability @xmath167 of the final data @xmath168 is given by @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the displacement operator .",
    "note , if bob measures the @xmath26 quadrature of his mode  4 , yielding @xmath171 , after receiving the bell measurement result , he modifies his data as @xmath172 .",
    "now , we consider the eb scheme , where alice and bob generate the tmsv states @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively , and transmit modes  2 and 3 towards the untrusted relay . after the bell measurement at the relay with the outcome @xmath164 and the probability @xmath157 , the density operator of the system is given by @xmath173 where the initial density matrix of the system , @xmath174 , and the global unitary operator @xmath158 are the same as those in the modified pm scheme . after broadcasting the bell measurement results @xmath164 to alice and bob , alice keeps mode  1 unchanged , while bob displaces mode  4 by the displacement operator @xmath175 , where @xmath176 is the gain factor in the eb scheme . at this step",
    "the density operator of the system is given by @xmath177 where mode  @xmath60 is mode  4 after the displacement .",
    "then alice and bob apply the homodyne detections on mode  1 and @xmath60 , respectively . here , again we assume alice and bob measure the @xmath25 quadrature of modes  1 and @xmath60 , yielding @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "the probability @xmath167 of the data @xmath180 given the bell measurement result @xmath164 is @xmath181 thus , the probability of the final data @xmath168 is given by @xmath182 comparing eqs .   and",
    ", the probability of the final data is the same for the modified pm scheme and the eb scheme when @xmath183 .",
    "as such , the modified pm scheme and our eb scheme are equivalent . the equivalence between the pm scheme and the modified pm scheme leads to the equivalence claimed in this paper ."
