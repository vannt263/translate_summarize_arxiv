    "in the context of hybrid medical imaging methods , a physical coupling between a high - contrast modality ( e.g. electrical impedance tomography , optical tomography ) and a high - resolution modality ( e.g. acoustic waves , magnetic resonance imaging ) is used in order to benefit from the advantages of both . without this coupling ,",
    "the high - contrast modality , usually modeled by an inverse problem involving the reconstruction of the constitutive parameter of an elliptic pde from knowledge of boundary functionals , results in a mathematically severely ill - posed problem and suffers from poor resolution .",
    "the analysis of this coupling usually involves a two - step inversion procedure where the high - resolution modality provides internal functionals , from which we reconstruct the parameters of the elliptic equation , thus leading to improved resolution @xcite .",
    "a problem that has received a lot of attention recently concerns the reconstruction of the conductivity tensor @xmath0 in the elliptic equation @xmath1 from knowledge of internal power density measurements of the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 both solve with possibly different boundary conditions .",
    "this problem is motivated by a coupling between electrical impedance imaging and ultrasound imaging and also finds applications in thermo - acoustic imaging .",
    "explicit reconstruction procedures for the above non - linear problem have been established in @xcite , successively in the 2d , 3d , and @xmath5d isotropic case , and then in the 2d and @xmath5d anisotropic case . in these articles , the number of functionals may be quite large .",
    "the analyses in @xcite were recently summarized and pushed further in @xcite . if one decomposes @xmath0 into the product of a scalar function @xmath6 and a scaled anisotropic structure @xmath7 such that @xmath8 , the latter reference establishes explicit reconstruction formulas for both quantities with lipschitz stability for @xmath9 in @xmath10 , and involving the loss of one derivative for @xmath7 .    in the isotropic case ,",
    "several works study the above problem in the presence of a lesser number of functionals .",
    "the case of one functional is addressed in @xcite , whereas numerical simulations show good results with two functionals in dimension @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "theoretical and numerical analyses of the linearized inverse problem are considered in @xcite .",
    "the stabilizing nature of a class of internal functionals containing the power densities is demonstrated in @xcite using a micro - local analysis of the linearized inverse problem .",
    "the above inverse problem is recast as a system of nonlinear partial differential equations in @xcite and its linearization analyzed by means of theories of elliptic systems of equations .",
    "it is shown in the latter reference that @xmath12 functionals , where @xmath5 is spatial dimension , is sufficient to reconstruct a scalar coefficient @xmath0 with elliptic regularity , i.e. , with no loss of derivatives , from power density measurements .",
    "this was confirmed by two - dimensional simulations in @xcite .",
    "all known explicit reconstruction procedures require knowledge of a larger number of internal functionals .    in the present work , we study the linearized version of this inverse problem in the anisotropic case , i.e. we write an expansion of the form @xmath13 with @xmath14 known and @xmath15 , and study the reconstructibility of @xmath0 from linearized power densities ( lpd ) .",
    "we first proceed by supporting the perturbation @xmath0 away from the boundary @xmath16 and analyze microlocally the symbol of the linearized functionals , and show that , as in @xcite , a large enough number of functionals allows us to construct a left - parametrix and set up a fredholm inversion .",
    "the main difference between the isotropic and anisotropic settings is that the anisotropic part of the conductivity is reconstructed with a loss of one derivative .",
    "such a loss of a derivative is optimal since our estimates are elliptic in nature .",
    "it is reminiscent of results obtained for a similar problem in @xcite .",
    "secondly , we show how the explicit inversion approach presented in @xcite carries through linearization , thus allowing for reconstruction of fully anisotropic tensors supported up to the boundary of @xmath17 . in this case",
    ", we derive reconstruction formulas that require a smaller number of power densities than in the non - linear case , giving possible room for improvement in the non - linear inversion algorithms .    for additional information on hybrid inverse problems in other areas of ( mostly medical ) imaging",

    "consider the conductivity equation , where @xmath18 is open , bounded and connected with @xmath19 , and where @xmath20 is a uniformly elliptic conductivity tensor over @xmath17 .",

    "we consider the measurement functionals @xmath25    considering an expansion of the form @xmath26 , where the background conductivity @xmath14 is known , uniformly elliptic and @xmath27 so small that the total @xmath20 remains uniformly elliptic , we first look for the frchet derivative of with respect to @xmath0 at @xmath14 . expanding the solutions @xmath22 accordingly as @xmath28 the pde at orders @xmath29 and @xmath30 gives rise to two relations @xmath31",
    "the measurements then look like @xmath32 therefore , the component @xmath33 of the frchet derivative of @xmath34 at @xmath14 is @xmath35 where the @xmath36 s are linear functions in @xmath0 according to .    in both subsequent approaches ,",
    "reconstruction formulas are established under the following two assumptions about the behavior of solutions related to the conductivity of reference @xmath14 .",

    "setting , we find that _",
    "one _ additional solution such that @xmath47 has full rank is enough to reconstruct the linear perturbation @xmath0 .",
    "we thus formulate our second crucial assumption here :    [ hyp : z ] assume that hypothesis [ hyp : det ] holds over some fixed @xmath37 .",
    "there exists @xmath48 such that the solution @xmath43 of with boundary condition @xmath49 has a full - rank matrix @xmath47 ( as defined in ) over @xmath50 .",
    "[ rem : const ] in the case where @xmath14 is constant , then it is straightforward to see that @xmath51 ( @xmath41 ) fulfill hypothesis [ hyp : det ] over @xmath17 .",

    "it has been pointed out that hypothesis [ hyp : det ] may not be systematically satisfied globally in dimension @xmath60 . a more general hypothesis to consider",
    "would come from picking a larger family ( of cardinality @xmath61 ) of solutions whose gradients have maximal rank throughout @xmath17 . while this additional technical point would not alter qualitatively the present reconstruction algorithms",
    ", it would add complexity in notation which the authors decided to avoid ; see also @xcite .      in the reconstruction approach developped in @xcite for the non - linear problem",

    "namely , consider the decomposition of the tensor @xmath62 into the product of a scalar function @xmath63 and a scaled anisotropic structure @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "the following results were then established .",
    "starting from @xmath5 solutions whose gradients form a basis of @xmath66 over a subset @xmath67 , it was shown that under knowledge of a @xmath68 anisotropic structure @xmath64 , the scalar function @xmath69 was uniquely and lipschitz - stably reconstructible in @xmath70 from @xmath10 power densities .",
    "additionally , if one added a finite number of solutions @xmath71 such that the family of matrices @xmath72 defined as in imposed enough orthogonality constraints on @xmath64 , then the latter was explicitely reconstructible over @xmath50 from the mutual power densities of @xmath73 .",
    "the latter reconstruction was stable in @xmath74 for power densities in @xmath10 norm , thus it involved the loss of one derivative .    passing to the linearized setting now ( recall @xmath13 ) , and anticipating",
    "that one scalar quantity may be more stably reconstructible than the others , this quantity should be the linearized version of @xmath75 .",

    "the objective in this section is to show , following earlier work in the isotropic case in @xcite , that such an operator is elliptic under appropriate conditions .",
    "we first fix @xmath85 and assume that @xmath86 , so that integrals of the form @xmath87 are well - defined , with @xmath88 a matrix - valued symbol whose entries are polynomials in @xmath89 ( see @xcite ) and where the hat denotes the fourier transform @xmath90 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath91 and can be extended smoothly by @xmath92 outside @xmath93 . as pointed out in @xcite , in order to treat this problem microlocally",

    "we will therefore not distinguish the operators @xmath33 from their pseudo - differential counterparts .",
