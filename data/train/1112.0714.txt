    "systems that have crackling noise and avalanches exhibit scale invariance and power laws , which point to the notion of underlying universality  @xcite .",
    "these systems include many of the best - studied examples of non - equilibrium critical phenomena , and much progress has been made in a renormalization group context  @xcite .",
    "the renormalization group implies that the long length and time behavior near critical points is governed by universal exponents and scaling functions .",
    "however , the predictive power of these theoretical studies has hiterto been underutilized ; the primary focus of experiments and numerical simulations has been on precise estimates of critical exponents , rather than on the universal joint predictions of properties involving several control parameters and/or measured quantities .",
    "a wide variety of materials and natural systems have been studied in the context of non - equilibrium critical phenomena .",
    "many of these systems exhibit avalanches which have power law size distributions .",
    "these include barkhausen noise in ferromagnets  @xcite , fluid imbibition into porous media , flux - line depinning  @xcite , and martensitic transformations  @xcite , to name a few . in the first three of these systems ,",
    "avalanches are the result of the jerky motion of an interface ( domain wall , fluid front , flux - line ) in a disordered environment , and can be described by the same family of front - propagation models .    in this manuscript , we study the spatial structures of avalanches in a front - propagation model in two dimensions , developing tools and methods needed for systematic study and extraction of these multiparameter universal scaling functions . to illustrate the utility and importance of these functions , we apply them systematically to a practical experimental problem  the size distributions of avalanches seen through a viewing window .",
    "this problem illustrates ( a )  the complexity and sophistication of the different emergent size distributions , ( b )  the relationships amongst the probability distributions of heights , widths , and sizes and their utility in generating predictions for windowed avalanches , and ( c )  the use of functional forms and least - squares fits to analyze and report on these multiparameter scaling functions .",
    "imaging experiments have been used in recent years to study a wide variety of systems exhibiting crackling noise or similar dynamics .",
    "barkhausen noise is measured making use of the magneto - optical kerr effect  @xcite , allowing one to examine the domain wall motion in 2d thin films in real - time . in experiments on superconducting vortices  @xcite , a magneto - optical ( mo ) setup is also used . in experiments of fracture  @xcite , fluid imbibition  @xcite and granular systems  @xcite , the dynamics are also followed with a camera .",
    "these visualization experiments provide an unusual opportunity : we now can study the universal properties of the spatial morphology  various distributions of heights , widths , angles , local heights , etc of either the avalanches or the fronts",
    ". however , the measurements of these properties are often distorted by a limited field of view .",
    "we hereby take this problem and develop the scaling theory for the universal functions needed to characterize the results of a generic imaging experiment  the distribution of avalanche sizes seen through windows .",
    "the limited field of view in experiments distort the size distributions of avalanches , and cause difficulties in characterizing the critical exponents .",
    "naturally , there is a bias towards small avalanches ; large ones are cut off by the boundaries of the window .",
    "it can also distort the size distribution if pieces of large avalanches cut off by window boundaries are counted as small ones .",
    "experiments have taken a variety of approaches to deal with such windowing effects : `` laser reflectometry ''  @xcite on barkhausen noise uses the magneto - optical kerr effect , but lacking spatial resolution , lumps fragments and avalanches together ; meanwhile , other optical kerr experiments have shown  @xcite that the effective size exponent @xmath0 for this lumped distribution depends strongly on the window width .",

    "we will show comprehensively how to analyze all of the size data lying within a window , and how to use the different classes of avalanches to get independent measures of various critical exponents .",

    "characterizing spatial structures of avalanches must go far beyond the traditional focus on critical exponents .",

    "we are taking the first steps towards the use of scaling methods as a practical engineering tool .",
    "since our theme is multifaceted , readers may be interested in focusing on different aspects of this work . in this section we present an overview of key results in this paper and a summary of their corresponding sections .",
    "* 1 . universal spatial structures of avalanches in directed percolation depinning . *",
    "we provide a substantive analysis of the universal spatial morphology of avalanches in the quenched kpz ( qkpz ) model in 1 + 1 dimensions ( the model is discussed in section  [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : window_dist](a ) shows avalanches in a typical simulation of this model .",
    "analogous to magnetic systems , we have added a  demagnetization factor  @xmath1 that parameterizes the restoring force , which allows us to access many metastable configurations of the front near the depinning transition , and controls the typical width of an avalanche , @xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ fig : scaleinvariant ] shows examples of these resulting avalanches from simulations of various @xmath1 . in section  [ sec : fullsystem ] , we thoroughly examine the spatial structure of the avalanches , including sizes @xmath3 ( the total area covered between pinned fronts , which would correspond to the total magnetization change in magnets , or the avalanche size of a rice pile ) , and also widths @xmath4 and heights @xmath5 ( which measure the length of an avalanche in directions perpendicular and parallel to the direction of the motion of the front ; this corresponds to studying the shapes of the magnetic domains or flux lines ) .",
    "we examine and fit the distributions of these sizes , heights and widths in section  [ sec : fullsystem ] .        *",
    "2 . avalanches in windows .",
    "* as mentioned in the introduction , in many imaging experiments the limited field of view distorts the avalanche size distribution .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : window_dist](b ) and ( c ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : window_dist](b ) most of the avalanches are cut off by the left and right boundaries- if one were to count the area of these avalanches , we would count large ones as smaller ones .",
    "the resulting size distribution inside the window ( dashed line of figure  [ fig : window_dist](c ) ) has a very different power law and shape compared to the full system distribution ( solid line of figure  [ fig : window_dist](c ) ) .    in section",
    "[ sec : window ] , we show in detail how avalanches which cross boundaries exhibit distinctly different size distributions and critical exponents . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider a strip geometry where only the left / right boundaries are relevant ( since avalanches in our system are flat and wide , few touch the top or bottom ) .",
    "we can therefore separate avalanches into four different categories , 00 , 01 , 10 , and 11 , depending on whether avalanches touch ( 1 ) or do not touch ( 0 ) the left or right boundaries : internal avalanches ( 00 ) ( figure  [ fig : window_dist](d ) ) , split avalanches ( 10 and 01)(figure  [ fig : window_dist](e ) and ( f ) ) , and spanning avalanches ( 11 ) ( figure  [ fig : window_dist](g ) ) .",
    "the internal ( 00 ) avalanches share the same power law as that of the full distribution , with a cutoff controlled by both the system size @xmath6 and the window size @xmath7 .",
    "the split ( 10 or 01 ) avalanches have a modified power law- a smaller exponent as larger avalanches are counted as smaller halves .",
    "( see figure  [ fig : window_dist])(c ) ) .",
    "the spanning avalanches also exhibit a smaller exponent , although this is not obvious in the shape of its scaling function .",
    "we can see that it has both an outer cutoff due to @xmath6 and an inner cutoff due to the window size @xmath7 , since avalanches must be large enough to span the window ( purple dash - dotted line in figure  [ fig : window_dist](c ) ) .",
    "the internal and spanning avalanches also have distinct universal scaling functions with a cutoff controlled predominately by the window size for windows comparable to or smaller than the size of @xmath6 . in section  [ sec : window ] and section",
    "[ sec : shapes ] we give a thorough analysis of these modified power laws , the different scaling shapes , and the results of fits to data .    having established a sophisticated method of analyzing both experimental and simulation data , we can utilize this analysis to enhance the collection of data in visualization experiments .",
    "section  [ sec : experiments ] has some suggestions for how to collect data and simultaneously analyze the scaling behavior of different magnifications , and extract multiple exponents .    *",
    "3 . functional forms *",
    "a main emphasis of our work is that we fit an entire functional form instead of power laws  @xcite , this includes the shape of the scaling function , and analytic and singular corrections to scaling .",
    "the benefit of approaching a scaling problem this way is that it allows us to account for both universal and non - universal effects in a consistent way .",
    "writing down the functional form that is given by the data for a certain universality class will also be useful for identifying and characterizing other systems that are thought to belong to the same universality class .",
    "we have found that , to analyze the windowed distributions , we need to first thoroughly examine the spatial structure of avalanches for the full system . in particular , in order to analyze the avalanche pieces left inside the window , we need to define height and width distributions and also joint distributions of sizes and widths .",
    "section  [ sec : fullsystem ] discusses these and also the results of fits for such distributions for the qkpz model we are studying . to focus on the scaling region , and minimize lattice effects , we will discuss these distributions in terms of _ fractional area distributions _",
    ", @xmath8 , the average fraction of the system that a given size takes up .",
    "a remarkable result is that size , height , and width distributions can be fitted with a nearly identical functional form .",
    "for example the size distribution is : @xmath9 here we have the shorthand @xmath10 .",
    "the width @xmath11 and height @xmath12 distributions are similar , with the form of @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is identical in form to the one quoted above in eq  [ eq : firsteq ] .",
    "fitting the size , height and width distributions at once , we can extract multiple exponents- not only the commonly measured size distribution exponent @xmath0 , but also the exponent @xmath17 which , as mentioned in point 1 , relates the typical width of an avalanche to @xmath1 , and also the roughness exponent @xmath18 . the roughness exponent @xmath18 , which measures the fluctuations of the interface , is typically quoted for front propagation models as a means of characterizing the universality class .",
    "( in our analysis , we have found a range for the roughness exponent @xmath18 ( from @xmath19 to @xmath20 ) that differs from the literature value @xmath21  @xcite ; we discuss this in appendix  [ sec : zeta ] . )",
    "one must note that the functional forms we choose are a practical tool to summarize existing information .",
    "while they may be inspired by analytical calculations , and chosen to be consistent with known asymptotics , they should be trusted only in the ranges over which they have been measured .    *",
    "4 . multivariable scaling problems . * the size distribution in eq .",
    "[ eq : firsteq ] has a scaling form with one scaling variable .",
    "however , in this paper we will consider many scaling forms with more than one variable , such as a joint size and width distribution ( [ sec : fullsystem ] ) , or the windowed distributions ( section  [ sec : window ] and  [ sec : shapes ] ) . in these cases ,",
    "two or more scaling variables are important for describing the shape of the distribution ( as seen in figure  [ fig : window_dist](c ) ) .",
    "for example , the general form for the @xmath22 windowed distributions is : @xmath23 here the scaling functions become distributions with two scaling variables , the rescaled size @xmath24 and rescaled window width @xmath25 .",
    "the traditional `` scaling collapse '' methods become problematic when multiple scaling variables are simultaneously important ; this has hitherto retarded the effective study and use of these powerful universal joint distributions .",
    "we present a systematic method for analyzing scaling problems with multiple control variables . in our problem ,",
    "the two control parameters are the demagnetization factor @xmath1 , and the window width @xmath7 .",
    "we will show that the interplay between @xmath1 and @xmath7 is important for determining the shape of the avalanche size distributions .",
    "in particular , we can write scaling functions for the distributions of the avalanche pieces in terms of these two scaling variables @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( as seen in figure  [ fig : window_dist](c ) ) .",
    "for example , the scaling function for the 11 distribution is : @xmath28 section  [ sec : shapes ] discusses in detail the functions @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 that we consider .",
    "one may also find the results of fits ( figures and tables of parameters ) in section  [ sec : window ] .",
    "* 5 . sloppyscaling",
    "* the analysis in this paper is done in the software environment _ sloppyscaling _ and includes a bayesian analysis of systematic error bars , which are explained in appendix  [ subsec : systematic ] .",
    "_ sloppyscaling _ allows us to fit data without collapses , which as mentioned above is problematic when there is more than one scaling variable involved . included in the software setup",
    "are automatic fits of data to theory functions with nonlinear least - squares and ease of visualizing results .",
    "this software may be applied to many different multivariable scaling problems , making full use of universality and the predictions of the renormalization group .",
    "all of the fits in this paper and their corresponding figures ( including axis labels ) were generated directly and automatically using _",
    "( a )  @xmath32 ( b )  @xmath33 ( c )  @xmath34 ( @xmath1 is what controls the typical avalanche sizes in a given system , giving a characteristic width @xmath6 . ) larger demagnetization fields stop avalanches more strongly , hence large @xmath1 corresponds to smaller avalanches .",
    "the colored regions represent avalanches .",
    "the fronts are moving from bottom to top .",
    "notice that the two simulations are statistically similar to one another apart from a rescaling of heights and widths .",
    "note that most of the area is covered by the largest avalanches.,width=302 ]    we use a model for imbibition fronts to produce avalanches , it is extensively studied , with well - established critical exponents .",
    "we simulate crackling noise using a quenched kpz model in 1 + 1 dimensions ( see appendix  [ subsec : numerics ] for details on the implementation )  @xcite , with dynamics given by : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the height of the front , @xmath37 the driving force increasing quasistatically , linear and non - linear terms for the kpz model controlled by the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively , and @xmath40 gaussian quenched disorder . in the spirit of magnetic avalanche models  @xcite , we have added a term analogous to a demagnetization field @xmath41 , which allows us to have pinned fronts at many metastable configurations .",
    "models like these have been simulated  @xcite mostly near the depinning transition ( and with @xmath42 ) . with @xmath43",
    ", we define the area between each pinned front as an avalanche of size @xmath44 .",
    "avalanches produced by this model are thought to belong to the directed percolation depinning ( dpd ) universality class  @xcite .",
    "the avalanches are self - affine , long and wide , with @xmath45 .",
    "the roughness exponent @xmath18 characterizes the ruggedness of the front , and also governs the scaling of avalanche heights @xmath5 with widths @xmath4 , @xmath46  @xcite . in our model",
    ", @xmath1 controls the typical size of the avalanche ( figure  [ fig : scaleinvariant ] ) , the larger the @xmath1 the smaller the typical size of an avalanche .",
    "we define the characteristic width of an avalanche in the full , unwindowed system to be @xmath47 .",
    "we will write all the scaling forms in terms of the length @xmath6 rather than the demagnetizing factor @xmath1 directly to emphasize the analogies to finite - size scaling , as we are also studying finite _ window _ sizes compared to the size of @xmath6 .",
    "in this section we will introduce various avalanche spatial distributions and their scaling forms .",
    "these forms will allow us to motivate the windowed distributions , and also serve as an example where traditional collapses may lead to questionable results .      traditionally , to describe an avalanche size distribution , we write the probability distribution as a power law times a universal scaling function . for example : @xmath48 @xmath6 is the characteristic width of an avalanche , and @xmath49 the typical largest height , and therefore the appropriate scaling variable to describe the area of an avalanche is @xmath10 .",
    "when studying the spatial properties as in our case , the probability distribution @xmath50 ( eq .  [ eq : p(s ) ] ) is not the best choice , as its normalization is highly affected by non - universal effects at the lattice spacing ( figure  [ fig : ps ] ) .",
    "in fact , for @xmath51 , the normalization integral @xmath52 diverges at its lower ( ultraviolet ) limit @xmath53 , but not for @xmath54 .",
    "although we could study scaling functions that include a lattice cutoff , it is more interesting to focus on the large ( infrared ) avalanche cutoff , which depends on @xmath6 in a universal way . to this end , it is more appropriate to make use of the first moment of @xmath50 , and to consider the _ area - weighted size distribution _",
    "@xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 has a natural physical interpretation : it is the fraction of the full system area covered by avalanches with sizes between @xmath44 and @xmath58 .",
    "its scaling form is thus : @xmath59 we use the subscripts @xmath60 to distinguish the scaling of the size distributions governed by @xmath1 from those governed by other control variables .",
    "the power of @xmath6 we pull out of the scaling function is needed to normalize @xmath55 to one , since @xmath55 is sensitive to the long - distance cutoff .",
    "in particular ,    @xmath61    where the last integral converges for @xmath62 , but we would need to use the second moment @xmath63 for the 3d nucleated rfim  @xcite , which has @xmath64 . ] and becomes small as @xmath6 becomes large .",
    "notice that the normalization of a power law must either diverge at the lower or at the upper limit . by studying avalanches weighted by their first moment",
    ", the normalization depends explicitly on @xmath6 , the infrared cutoff .",
    "this is the regime we are mainly interested in , since we would like to study the finite size effects imposed by both @xmath1 and the window size @xmath7 . alternatively ,",
    "as done in  @xcite , one may also define a scale @xmath65 , redefine the sizes as @xmath66 and a corresponding @xmath67 which has normalization @xmath68 . here",
    "@xmath69 is universal , but is also not a probability distribution in the conventional sense .",
    "this definition has an effect equivalent to what we do here : to make the function universal and insensitive to non - universal lattice effects on normalization .",
    "namely , our definitions are related in the following way : @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "here we use @xmath72 , which is consistent with their definition of @xmath73 up to a constant factor .",
    "we prefer to focus on the more directly interpretable fractional area distribution @xmath55 .",
    "furthermore , notice that we have been unorthodox in writing the scaling form  ( [ eq : aofsandkappa ] ) for @xmath74 with a power of both @xmath6 and of @xmath44 outside the scaling function .",
    "normally one factors out a single variable from the scaling function .",
    "for example , one could in principle write @xmath75 in this form , @xmath76 is invariant under rescaling , and also clearly preserves normalization .",
    "however , @xmath77 vanishes as @xmath78 , so this form of the scaling function disguises the power law behavior of the avalanche size distribution . by choosing the form @xmath79 which is defined to be finite and non - zero as @xmath80",
    ", we make manifest both the avalanche size dependence and the system size dependence .",
    "in addition to the size distributions , we can also study the avalanche height and width distributions .",
    "we define height along the direction of front propagation , measuring the maximum height of an avalanche , and width perpendicular to heights , measuring the maximum width of an avalanche .",
    "how do the height and width distributions scale ?",
    "an avalanche of height @xmath5 has size @xmath81 , so the system area @xmath82 covered by avalanches with heights between @xmath5 and @xmath83 scales as @xmath84 and since @xmath85 , @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the appropriate scaling variable to describe the avalanche height .",
    "similarly , we can write the scaling form for the width distributions as : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the scaling variable for widths .    notice the pattern in all these formulas : @xmath90 is a function with @xmath91 of scaling variables ( combinations of @xmath92 and @xmath93 invariant under the renormalization group rescaling ) multiplying a power of the scaling variable , divided by the independent variable @xmath92 , making @xmath94 invariant under rescaling , allowing it to be universal .      in figs .",
    "[ fig : ps - b ] ,  [ fig : ah ] ,  [ fig : aw ] we show the size , height and width distributions for our qkpz simulations at various @xmath1 , and at different simulation sizes @xmath93 .",
    "the curves are theoretical fits using a functional form of the type @xmath95 where @xmath96 , and @xmath97 , and @xmath98 are ( 5x3 ) fitting parameters ( results are listed in table  [ table : shw - fit ] ) . the first exponential term is the universal scaling function , while the second accounts for non - universal analytic corrections at small @xmath99 due to lattice effects  @xcite .",
    "( see appendix  [ subsec : corrections ] ) .",
    "one may ask why we choose this particular scaling form .",
    "when fitting data to a function , there are many parameterizations we could use to describe the data .",
    "this form is motivated from a functional renormalization group expansion by le doussal and wiese for static avalanche size distributions in a linear model  @xcite .",
    "our model differs in that there is a nonlinear kpz term leading to anisotropy , so that our avalanches belong to a different universality class , the dpd universality class .",
    "le doussal and wiese find the avalanche size distribution for the linear model , for all static universality classes ( random - bond , random - field , and random - periodic ) , to leading order in @xmath100 ( where @xmath101 is the dimension of the interface ) , to be : @xmath102    here their scaling form includes the large scale cutoff @xmath73 .",
    "le doussal and wiese claim that their results for both static and dynamic avalanches agree up to one loop for systems with @xmath103 .",
    "static avalanches are separated by equilibrium configurations ( or ground states ) , and dynamic avalanches are connected through a sequence of metastable states .",
    "our avalanches result from a moving interface near the depinning transition , so they belong to a dynamic universality class .",

    "the local height distribution is shown in figure  [ fig : ahxl ] . here",
    "the curves show a fit we have generated with a scaling function of the fit to @xmath22 spanning avalanches ( eq  [ eq : a11function ] ) which cross both window boundaries , taking the limit of @xmath130 .",
    "our best measure of the local heights is equivalent to a @xmath22 distribution with window size @xmath135 .",
    "details for how this works are provided in the section  [ subsec:11 ] .",
    "once we have distributions for the measures of size @xmath44 , width @xmath4 and height @xmath5 , we can also explore the forms of joint distributions .",
    "the area @xmath136 of avalanches in the range of size @xmath137 and widths @xmath138 will go to zero strongly if the size @xmath44 becomes either much larger than or much smaller than the typical size @xmath139 of an avalanche of width @xmath4  so we may factor out any combination of powers of @xmath4 and @xmath44 without changing the singularity .",
    "it still makes sense , though , to factor out the @xmath6-dependence .",
    "if we choose to factor out powers of @xmath44 , therefore , we find @xmath140 where again we have a power of a dimensionless scaling variable , times a scaling function , divided by @xmath141 since @xmath142 is multiplied by @xmath143 in its invariant form .    the last joint distribution that will be useful is related to right - most pieces of an avalanche .",
    "consider the right - most piece of width @xmath99 of an avalanche of total width @xmath4 and total size @xmath44 ; let this segment have size @xmath3 .",
    "( this will be the size measured by a window that cuts the avalanche at the left - hand window boundary at @xmath99 . )",
    "let @xmath144 be the fraction of the system covered by such avalanche pieces .",
    "then , in the same logic as before , this five - variable distribution can be written as a power law times a universal function of four variables :    @xmath145    one can clearly work out scaling forms for joint distributions of several variables and other combinations .",
    "the ones we have discussed here will be needed in our analysis of windowing effects .",
    "now that we have laid the groundwork for exploring the shapes of avalanches , we focus on analyzing avalanches inside a viewing window . in this section , we focus on how to define the right power laws and scaling ; we also give results for fits , extracting critical exponents . in the next section ,",
    "we go into more detail about the scaling shapes of these distributions - the universal scaling _ functions _ for avalanche sizes viewed through windows .    in imaging experiments one often runs into the problem of not being able to see the whole system , distorting the avalanche size distribution . in particular , for barkhausen noise",
    ", typical magnetic avalanches span many decades in size , far beyond the spatial resolution of optical microscopes .",
    "the natural solution is to take measurements at a variety of magnifications .",
    "even though at the weakest magnifications the window size @xmath146 and most avalanches avoid the window boundaries , the effects of the boundaries will always dominate at the highest magnifications .",
    "the analysis in this section not only provides a method to correct for finite - size - like window effects on exponents , but allows us to actively make use of all the data for a range of magnifications .    we show in detail in this section and the next how the avalanches which cross different boundaries exhibit distinctly different size distributions and critical exponents ( figure  [ fig : window_dist ] ) . as described in section  [ sec : summary ] , we consider the avalanches measured in an infinite strip of width @xmath7 ( figure  [ fig : window_dist](b ) ) , for a system with characteristic length @xmath6 .",
    "we separate avalanches into different categories : internal avalanches ( 00 ) , split avalanches ( 10 and 01 ) , and spanning avalanches ( 11 ) .",
    "let us call @xmath147 the area fraction covered by such avalanches with sizes in the range @xmath148 .",
    "( for @xmath149 , the segment size equals the total size . ) the split ( 10 or 01 ) avalanches will have area fraction @xmath150 for each @xmath3 .",
    "the distribution @xmath151 ( figure  [ fig : window_dist](f ) ) of avalanches touching the right boundary naturally equals @xmath152 on average .",
    "@xmath153 is the fraction of the strip spanned by 11 spanning avalanches .",
    "we mentioned in section  [ sec : summary ] that the 00 avalanches have a power law that matches the full system , whereas the 10 , 01 , 11 avalanches all have modified power laws with a smaller exponent @xmath0 .",
    "besides different power law scaling , the universal scaling functions for these different avalanche distributions are also distinct .",
    "in particular , the cutoff dependence on window size is different for internal avalanches and split avalanches , while the spanning avalanches have both an outer and an inner cutoff due to the window size ( since avalanches must be large enough to span the window ) .",
    "we present the fits of these universal scaling functions in this section and discuss their shapes in more detail in the next .",
    "we know that all avalanches in the window are of one of the 00 , 10 , 01 , 11 types , so @xmath154    as in the previous section , consider how each of these distributions @xmath155 rescales under a coarse - graining by a factor @xmath156 .",
    "the @xmath157 denote our indices for the various windowed distributions ( 00 , 10 , 01 , 11 ) .",
    "each @xmath158 , being a geometrical quantity ( a fractional area ) , must be invariant under rescaling ( with two invariant scaling variables ) : @xmath159 however , this is clearly not the form which makes the size and window - width dependence of the avalanche sizes manifest .",
    "we are allowed to factor powers of the invariant scaling variables @xmath160 and @xmath161 out of the scaling function @xmath162 : @xmath163 the appropriate powers of @xmath3 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 to pull outside depend upon which of the three distributions we are considering . for the distributions @xmath149 and @xmath152 , @xmath151 , we choose @xmath164 and @xmath165 ( powers of the invariant scaling variables @xmath166 and @xmath167 ) to make the resulting scaling function go to a constant at small @xmath92 and/or @xmath168 . this way the power laws we pull out describe the behavior of the limit of small @xmath3 , and the way in which the avalanches are cut off by the window size ( as @xmath3 approaches @xmath169 )",
    "are described by the scaling function . on the other hand for @xmath170",
    "there are no small avalanches ( they have to be large enough to span the window ) , and as @xmath171 , all avalanches span the window and become 11 avalanches , and in this limit the distribution will not go to zero , so for this distribution we instead pull out powers of @xmath7 and @xmath3 .",
    "first let us consider @xmath172 , the window area spanned by avalanches of sizes in @xmath173 that do not touch the boundaries .",
    "this can be computed explicitly from the function @xmath142 ( eq .  [ eqn : awsjoint ] ) which gives the area covered by avalanches of width @xmath4 and size @xmath44 ( note that for @xmath174 avalanches , the segment pieces @xmath175 ) :    @xmath176    where @xmath177 is the probability that an avalanche whose center lies within the window is entirely contained in the window ( i.e. , the avalanche center lies within @xmath178 of the center of the window ) . changing variables from @xmath4 to @xmath179 , @xmath180 with no explicit dependence on the window width @xmath7 ( so @xmath181 ) , and the same critical exponent @xmath182 that is given by the non - windowed distribution .",

    "( [ eq : a00scaling ] ) is of the general form given by eq .  ( [ eq : bzzscaling ] ) and  ( [ eq : azzscaling ] ) .",
    "this scaling equation is also consistent with our numerics : the normalization of the distribution for small avalanches is independent of @xmath7 , and @xmath183 is consistent with the bulk @xmath184 .",
    "using this scaling form , we fit the @xmath174 data ( jointly with @xmath22 and @xmath185 data ) with a scaling function given by a parameterized functional form : @xmath186 with @xmath187 .",
    "our fit for the parameter @xmath188 is @xmath189 , which we believe to be @xmath190 ( see next section ) .",

    "one may note the exponent @xmath18 in our fits is fixed to the literature value of 0.63 . if we allow for a free fit on all the parameters , it shifts to @xmath195 .",
    "although the free fit is @xmath196 away from the accepted value of @xmath18 , the fit with fixed @xmath197 has only a @xmath198 higher cost than the free fit minimum , suggesting an average of @xmath199 drift on the parameters instead of @xmath196 as seen in table  [ table : fit ] .",
    "this suggests three cautions ( 1 )  the estimate on our systematic error ( 0.02 ) is a lower bound estimate , and in fact the systematic error should be higher .",
    "( 2 )  the fact that our systematic error should be higher also implies that the scaling functions are imperfect and may be improved upon .",
    "( 3 )  there could be corrections due to a crossover that depends on both @xmath39 and @xmath1 which we have not accounted for , which are distorting the fit .",

    "the best fit value of @xmath308 is @xmath309 , whereas the expected was @xmath310 .",
    "finally , one may note that in our system all the @xmath248 turn out to fit to our expected @xmath190 within the error bars of @xmath18 .",
    "one may be tempted to set @xmath248 as @xmath190 and have fewer fit parameters in one s form ; however , we recognize that our geometrical arguments do not hold for front propagation that is super - rough with @xmath311 , or for models that allow overhangs , so we leave @xmath248 as a free parameter to signify this geometrical constraint .",
    "although there are noticeable imperfections in the theory function , the agreement is impressive between theory and simulation as seen in figures  [ fig:00shape ] ,  [ fig:10shape ] , and  [ fig:11shape ] .",
    "the scaling function for each of the three distributions is a competition between two types of terms : the rescaled size @xmath312 and the rescaled window size @xmath27 . upon examining the fit parameters of the scaling function",
    ", all three distributions share the characteristic that at small @xmath25 the terms with pure powers of @xmath313 and @xmath314 become unimportant , leaving only @xmath315 for the @xmath174 and @xmath185 distributions , and for the @xmath22 a @xmath306 term .",
    "notice that for the @xmath174 and @xmath185 distributions , since @xmath248 is @xmath316 , the @xmath6 dependence disappears for the universal scaling function at small @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , the shape of the scaling function is cut off mainly by the window size @xmath7 .",
    "in fact removing the @xmath24 terms for these functions does not affect the shape for @xmath317 . for experiments that study systems in the same universality class as this one , this implies that data may be measured at large magnifications ( small windows ) and fit to extract exponents and scaling behavior without the extra , often unknown , scale of @xmath6 .",
    "what does our analysis imply for current experiments ? how should one conduct the experiment and analyze the data ? here",
    "we discuss for the particular case of magnetic avalanches in barkhausen noise , how to take into account window effects and further enhance the collection of data .",
    "there are two optical methods for detecting avalanche distributions for barkhausen noise in 2d thin films , and both make use of the magneto - optical kerr effect ( moke ) .",
    "when a polarized beam of light reflects off a magnetized sample , the reflected polarization is affected depending on the magnetization .",
    "a second polarizer can be used to filter this signal , and then using either a photodiode  @xcite , or an optical microscope  @xcite , we can collect data about the avalanches from the signal . for experiments using a photodiode (",
    "let us call this `` laser reflectometry '' ) , one can only measure the total magnetization change over time , and not individual avalanches . for experiments using an optical microscope ( let us call this `` avalanche visualization '' ) , one can resolve individual avalanches and their shape",
    ".    in laser reflectometry experiments  @xcite we only have information for the magnitude of magnetization as a function of time , and can not see which avalanches touch the boundary .",
    "furthermore , in current techniques the laser spots are gaussian in shape , and do not have sharp boundaries",
    ". however , there seems to be no fundamental reason why the illuminated region could not be optically generated with uniform illumination and sharp edges , up to some diffraction limit depending upon the geometry of the experiment .",
    "( a typical avalanche of interest is a few microns in size , large compared to the wavelength of optical light which is 400 - 700 nm ) .",
    "if one could make the edges of the laser spots sharper , one could adjust the laser spots to flicker between two sizes , one with a radius slightly larger than the other .",
    "events that occur with the same magnitude in both the large size measurement and the smaller size measurement would be 00 internal avalanches .",
    "more elaborate sequences of spot shapes could be used to further distinguish 01 and 10 split avalanches from 11 spanning avalanches .    for avalanche visualization experiments  @xcite ,",
    "it is straightforward to separate the data into 00 , 10 , 01 , and 11 avalanches for systems which have our strip geometry and flat fronts with @xmath318 .",
    "our analysis will remain valid with minor corrections due to real - world experimental circumstances .",
    "for example , sometimes the propagation direction of the front is not parallel to the top and bottom boundaries . in this case",
    "there would be corrections depending on the angle of the tilt @xmath319 and the size of the window .",
    "the local heights @xmath225 would need to be adjusted with the factor of @xmath320 .",
    "the 10 , and 01 avalanches would be cut off at an angle , but for self - affine ( short , wide ) avalanches these size corrections are likely irrelevant .    for materials with dipolar interactions and zig - zag shaped fronts  @xcite , we are less confident that our methods can be applied without modification .",
    "the large vertical extent of the zig - zag front suggests that all four boundaries of the window will matter ; therefore we will need to divide avalanches into more categories ( 0000 , 1000 , 0100 , 0010 , 1010 ... ) .",
    "the analysis for these types of avalanches will be more complicated .",
    "this would be an interesting problem to pursue by simultaneous analysis of simulations and the experimental data .",
    "knowing how to deal with window effects can be an important tool for these visualization experiments . by combining data at several magnifications ( corresponding to different window sizes )",
    ", we resolve a larger range of length scales . higher magnifications will show the small avalanches , while lower magnifications will allow us to both capture larger avalanches and explore more fully the 00 internal avalanches .",
    "for example , if our ccd camera recording the images has a resolution of @xmath321 pixels , and we have a magnification of up to 5x-50x , we can simultaneously explore a range of window sizes and extend our effective spatial resolution from @xmath321 to @xmath322 .",
    "more generally , this paper has provided the tools needed to extract from the experimental data for systems of similar interface dynamics the critical exponents @xmath0 , @xmath18 and the universal scaling functions @xmath79 , @xmath323 , etc . for these experiments , we can also measure widths and heights and the average shape , giving us an independent measure of @xmath18 , and the universal scaling function @xmath324 .",
    "our detailed analysis and comprehensive methods presented in this paper enable a more powerful interpretation of current experiments , and improved construction of future experiments .",
    "the avalanche simulations in this paper were produced using a quenched kpz model  @xcite , with dynamics given by : @xmath325 where @xmath36 is the height of the front , @xmath37 the driving force , @xmath1 the `` demagnetization field '' , linear and non - linear terms for the kpz model controlled by the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively , and @xmath40 gaussian random noise .",
    "this was run for system sizes of width @xmath93 4096 , 8192 , and 16384 .",
    "the simulations have been run in a strip geometry ( @xmath326 , @xmath327 , and @xmath328 ) and the bottom half of the simulations have been truncated to avoid transient effects due to the initially flat front .",
    "the left - right boundaries have periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the simulations are done using a discrete cellular automaton model , in which the displacement of the string @xmath5 , the time @xmath329 and the space @xmath99 are all discretized and take integer values @xcite . for a configuration @xmath330 , we compute the local force @xmath331 at each site @xmath332 , leading to a discretized version of eq .",
    "[ eq : qkpz ] @xmath333 where the sum runs over all the nearest neighbors @xmath334 for the site @xmath332 , @xmath208 is the discretization length that we set to @xmath135 , and @xmath335 is a random force .",
    "the automaton dynamics are as follows : ( 1 )  increment the external field until one site is unstable ( @xmath336 ) ; ( 2 )  determine for each site along the interface whether it is stable ( @xmath337 ) or unstable ( @xmath338 ) ; ( 3 )  advance all unstable sites by one step @xmath339 in parallel , generating a new value of the pinning force @xmath335 ; ( 4 )  repeat until no sites are unstable ( the end of the avalanche ) ; ( 5 )  repeat ( 1 - 4 ) until the front passes the top of the simulated window .",
    "we use nonlinear least squares methods for fitting data to theory functions , minimizing a cost defined as : @xmath340 here @xmath319 are the parameters , @xmath341 the function value , and @xmath342 the error on the data points .",
    "the weight @xmath343 in our case is determined by fluctuations from run to run .",
    "namely , we bin the data ( in equispaced log bins ) for each of @xmath344 simulations , calculate the standard deviation of this value across runs , divide by @xmath345 to get the fluctuation in the mean of that bin .     in our distributions ,",
    "small avalanches occur more often ( leading to small error bars ) , but large avalanches are more important , and the smallest avalanches suffer from non - universal lattice effects .",
    "so during the fitting process there is a tradeoff between fitting the region where there is good data and where the variations are most important .",
    "we use a number of methods to compensate for this imbalance .",
    "( 1 )   we set a minimum error bar ( @xmath346 of the data value ) on the data points , making the error bars on smaller avalanches larger , and therefore decreasing their weight .",
    "( 2 )   analytic and singular corrections to scaling can also account for non - universal effects .",
    "we include analytic corrections to scaling for the lattice effects in our scaling functions .",
    "these corrections appear in all distributions we discuss .",
    "a more detailed discussion is in section e of this appendix .",
    "( 3 )  one may also skip points that have non - universal behavior when fitting . for our fits in this paper , all points are included .",
    "another issue arises in regions where one has sparse data ; there may be bins that do not have any observations .",
    "for these zeros , the error bar should not be zero !",
    "we can use maximum likelihood methods to estimate theoretical errors .",
    "say we have @xmath344 experiments , and bin the data with @xmath347 sizes in each bin @xmath332 . with the median size in the bin @xmath348 , the expected probability for each size is @xmath349 , where @xmath55 is the theoretical distribution of sizes , and so getting a zero in one of the bins will have the probability @xmath350 . using maximum likelihood ,",
    "this results in a cost of @xmath351 given that @xmath352 is small .",
    "the residual we add to the total cost is therefore : @xmath353 this calculation is generalizable to sparse data that is non - zero- say one has @xmath354 events in a bin for @xmath344 measurements , then the probability is @xmath355 , and the appropriate error bar we get is approximately @xmath356 .",
    "one could then use the larger of the error bar given by this argument or the statistical error bars from the simulation . in practice , for our simulations , we find it sufficient to use the statistical error bars but to compensate with minimum error bars given by eq .",
    "[ eq : ml_err ] .    in non - linear",
    "least squares fitting , we can also include priors in the cost if we have assumptions or information a priori about the parameters . for example",
    ", in our problem , we put priors on the exponents inside the scaling functions ( @xmath188 , @xmath252 , etc ) to prevent them from going to large values and forcing their corresponding coefficients to zero . as a result our cost function now becomes : @xmath357 in eq .",
    "[ eq : cost_prior ] , @xmath354 represents all the arbitrary exponents that occur inside the scaling functions ( @xmath248 , @xmath358 , @xmath359 etc ... ) .",
    "@xmath360 is included to prevent @xmath266 from going to zero .",
    "a clear understanding of these techniques for fitting is important for increasing the reliability of our results , and acknowledging its limitations . in a following subsection ,",
    "section  [ subsec : systematic ] , we will further discuss how to estimate the reliability of results inferred by fitting data to a theory , generating systematic error bars for fitting results .      to facilitate the exploration of this problem ,",
    "we have developed a software environment , _ sloppyscaling _ , in python .",
    "this code is downloadable at http://www.lassp.cornell.edu/ sethna / sloppy / sloppyscaling / sloppyscaling.htm .",
    "the main features of this code include various nonlinear - least squares fitting methods  @xcite , automatic plotting for visualization , and methods for generating systematic error bars on the theory .",
    "we have quoted in our results systematic error bars instead of the more commonly used standard error bars in the parameters .",
    "standard errors given by the covariance matrix are expected to be erroneous for our problem , since our problem is highly nonlinear in the parameters , and also sloppy- parameter combinations in the sloppiest directions can vary an infinite amount without affecting the fit .",
    "we use a method due to frederiksen et .",
    "al  @xcite for bayesian estimation of errors .",
    "this method involves assuming that given a theory ( m ) which is imperfect , a spread of parameters ( each corresponding to different models ) may fit the data(d ) in an equally acceptable matter .",
    "we can define a probability of a certain model with @xmath361 where @xmath362 is the cost at a given set of parameters @xmath319 , and the effective temperature @xmath363 sets a scale for the fluctuations away form the best fit . since the cost at the best fit parameters @xmath364 is a measure of how well the theory is doing",
    ", we choose @xmath365 , where n is the number of parameters with  equipartition  allowing each degree of freedom a contribution of @xmath366 to the total cost .",
    "ideally , after defining such a probability , one should sample parameter space to determine the systematic error bars on parameters .",
    "however , in our functions sampling is non - trivial due to parameter evaporation  @xcite , the `` entropy '' for parameters drifting to infinity overwhelms their cost in degrading the resulting fits .",
    "therefore , we make a quadratic estimate of the fluctuations in predictions , essentially using propagation of error to estimate the systematic error .",
    "the covariance matrix gives an error @xmath367 that assumes the temperature of 1 , corresponding to @xmath368 .",
    "using propagation of error , we calculate the systematic error according to our effective temperature @xmath365 : @xmath369 the shaded plots are generated by sampling according to the hessian at the best fit , weighting our steps in each eigendirection by the inverse square root of the eigenvalue , and scaling the steps with a low temperature ( @xmath370 ) .",
    "then for our ensemble of parameters we calculate the fluctuations in the theory ( residuals @xmath371 ) corresponding to the ensemble .",
    "we scale up these fluctuations according to the temperature defined by the best fit , or @xmath372 , @xmath373 we have also estimated systematic errors by removing large @xmath1 curves ( which we believe have larger corrections ) , and looking at the corresponding drift in exponents and parameters .",
    "the estimate of the systematic error that this procedure gives is often similar ( sometimes smaller ) to the one using our temperature - scaled propagation of error .",
    "corrections to scaling play an important role in our scaling functions , their inclusion accounts for non - universal effects , and helps increase the reliability of universal predictions . in each of the scaling functions in this paper we have included analytic corrections to scaling that capture the lattice effects of our automata simulations .",
    "they are of the form : @xmath374 this expansion for small @xmath44 corrects for the lattice effects on small size avalanches which we believe to be present in the distributions .",
    "one can imagine that experiments may have other origins of non - universal effects , such as a nonlinear signal amplifier or distorting lens ; one should always attempt to account for and include these  @xcite .",
    "one caveat is that , just as adding extra free parameters does not necessarily increase the quality of one s fits , adding corrections is not a guarantee for increasing the accuracy of one s scaling function .",
    "one should be careful in checking that the terms included in the corrections to scaling behave as expected in the region of interest , are subdominant when taking the appropriate limits , and do not confuse the main universal scaling function , either by canceling out terms or having the same effect .",
    "an example of this complication is seen in our studies of using the limit of the @xmath22 distribution at @xmath130 for the local height distributions .    in sections  [ subsec :",
    "localheights ] and  [ subsec:11 ] , we take the view point of using the parameterized from of @xmath375 as the proper limit of @xmath226 . however , this data should be matched as well by @xmath376 , since in effect this is what we are fitting for the local height distributions .",
    "we can view the ratio between the two functions as a multiplicative correction to scaling from lattice effects ( without considering the corrections to scaling for lattice effects in equation  [ eq : latticecorrections ] ) : @xmath377 here we define @xmath378 .",
    "note however that for the term @xmath379 , the value of the fit for @xmath308 equals @xmath380 , which is within the range of error for @xmath381 .",
    "therefore this term is nearly @xmath382 , where @xmath383 .",
    "this term then has the same effect as the correction to scaling term @xmath384 at small @xmath7 ( since @xmath385 for @xmath22 avalanches at small @xmath7 ) .",
    "since @xmath384 is only significant in the range of small @xmath3 , which only occur in the @xmath22 distributions at small @xmath7 , these two parameters serve the same purpose , and it is redundant to include both for the fits . we therefore remove the term @xmath384 for the @xmath22 distributions for our fits .",
    "one can also check the corrections and see all powers of @xmath6 are negative , and the multiplicative correction approaches unity as we get closer to the critical point . with our current fit , the term with @xmath386 dominates the corrections .",
    "notice that , originally , to account for lattice effects , we have added corrections in integer powers of @xmath225 ( @xmath387 ) , which are subdominant compared to @xmath386 .",
    "this implies that there are more dangerous corrections to scaling than originally inferred . by this method",
    ", one might check if the corrections originally included are sufficient- in this case they are close , but could be improved upon by systematically adding similar terms .    in a continuum case ,",
    "the concept of local heights @xmath225 should describe a smooth shape tracing the depinning line , in our automata , since the smallest width is naturally 1 lattice spacing , the smallest possible window width is @xmath246 . in measuring the local heights",
    ", this discreteness limits the smoothness of the shape of @xmath225 , and gives rise to the corrections we see .",
    "here we ve seen that if we `` know '' from other measurements ( in our case the @xmath22 spanning avalanches ) the right limit the universal scaling form should take , we may find the form of the corrections .",
    "we have argued at various points in the paper that scaling collapses are limited and may lead to questionable results .",
    "here we will illustrate an example of this . using the critical exponents given by a free fit of the windowed distributions ( @xmath18 allowed to vary )",
    ", we collapse the sizes , heights and widths . comparing the figures included here and the ones in section  [ sec : fullsystem ] ( figures  [ fig : ascollapse ] ,  [ fig : ahcollapse ] , and  [ fig : awcollapse ] . )",
    ", one can see that the collapses are of similar quality .",
    ", @xmath388 , and @xmath389 .",

    "since @xmath17 does not change significantly , the quality of the collapses are similar . ]",
    "[ fig : awcollapse-068 ]    the fact that such distinct values of @xmath18 can yield similar quality collapses may imply ( 1 )  our `` systematic error '' bars on @xmath18 , estimated to be @xmath392 , are in reality much larger , ( 2 )  collapses do not incorporate non - universal corrections to scaling , and these may have an important effect , ( 3 )  collapses are not a reliable way of verifying the values of critical exponents .",
    "in particular , we expect corrections to scaling due to large @xmath1 to be responsible for the drift in exponents .    with these software tools and analytical methods , data at critical points",
    "may be analyzed while including multiple scaling variables , allowing for the treatment of a broad range of experiments , and also allowing for a far more rigorous estimation of statistical and systematic errors . by using automatic fits to entire scaling functions , instead of traditional collapses , and by estimating systematic error bars , we facilitate the interpretation of data with multiple scaling variables and analytic corrections to scaling",
    "this advance will allow for better characterization not only of noise in magnetic thin films and similar avalanche dynamics , but should be broadly applicable to all applications of critical phenomena and scaling theories to experiments and simulations .",

    "the shape of the front has been studied as an identifying feature for front propagation models , which is usually characterized by defining a roughness exponent @xmath18 , which is measured through a height - height correlation function : @xmath397        the quenched kpz model we use is conjectured to belong to the directed percolation depinning ( dpd ) universality class  @xcite , which is conjectured in turn to belong to the directed percolation(dp ) universality class . for a pinned interface in dpd , the roughness exponent @xmath398  @xcite matches that of the ratio of correlation length exponents in dp @xmath399  @xcite .",
    "( here @xmath400 and @xmath401 , where @xmath402 is the branching probability , and @xmath403 is the percolation threshold . ) .",
    "one may note that for a moving interface , the picture is less well known ; there has been numerical study that shows @xmath404  @xcite , but also arguments that the interface under this condition is not self - affine  @xcite , that the moving regions have @xmath405 and the pinned regions have @xmath197 .",
    "one could imagine that our demagnetizing force , like the velocity in dpd , could lead to a heterogeneous mixture of different scaling regions , converging to @xmath197 as @xmath42 .",

    "one can see clearly a drift in the measured exponent in figure  [ fig : local_log ] .",
    "the range of our estimates ( varying from @xmath406 to @xmath407 ) is large compared to our error estimates ; however , best fits with @xmath18 fixed within this range had costs within 1.5 times that of the best fit value , indicating both that our quadratic estimates for the systematic errors are too small and that it may be challenging to definitively measure @xmath18 in either simulation or experiment .",
    "in our fits we find that @xmath105 for the size , width and height distributions joint fit , and @xmath408 for the @xmath174 , @xmath185 , @xmath22 joint distributions .",
    "notice that although the direction of front propagation is in general along the y - axis in our problem , portions of the front will be at various angles to the y - axis .",
    "since the local direction of the front propagation is not fixed , we can also choose a rotationally invariant definition of height and width : defining the height and width of an avalanche along the axes of the moment of inertia tensor .",
    "we define root - mean - square heights and widths as the square root of its eigenvalues .",
    "so if we fit _",
    "rms _ heights and widths jointly , we get @xmath409 much higher than @xmath19 measured along the global axes .",
