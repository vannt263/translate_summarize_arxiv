    "in this supplemental material , we discuss details useful for the understanding of the main results of the paper .      in this section , we describe the ga @xcite used to obtain the decomposition of the local trotter blocks @xcite .",
    "the sequence of quantum gates is codified in a matrix representing in the protocol the genetic code of an individual .",
    "this matrix contains as many columns ( genes ) as allowed resources , and sufficient rows to determine the type of gate and the qubits on which it acts .",
    "the next step is to engineer a fitness or evaluation function which maps every individual into a real number .",
    "this allows to classify the individuals with respect to an adequate criterion for the optimization purposes . in our case",
    ", the fitness function corresponds to the fidelity with respect to the ideal block dynamics .",
    "finally , each cycle of the algorithm consists of three stages : breeding , mutation , and natural selection .    in the breeding stage ,",
    "a new generation of individuals is obtained by combining the genetic code of the predecessors , which provides the genetic code of the offspring .",
    "we have used a hierarchical combination method , which allows the number of broods of each individual to depend on its fidelity . in particular , for an initial population of @xmath53 individuals sorted by fidelity , our algorithm creates an offspring of @xmath103 , @xmath104 of which acquire genetic material of the first precursor , @xmath105 of the second , @xmath53 of the third , and @xmath106 of the fourth .",
    "notice that each newborn individual is produced with the genetic information of two predecessors , as it can be seen from the fact that adding the numbers of each progeny equals two times the number of newborn individuals .",
    "notice that this is not the most general situation , since we could have considered individuals as a combination of more predecessors .",
    "additionally , the amount of genes each precursor provides , in this case the number of matrix columns , also depends on the hierarchy induced by fidelity .    in the mutation stage ,",
    "every individual is allowed to mutate by randomly modifying any sequence of genetic material , with equal probability for all individuals .",
    "this probability settles the threshold to overcome for a random number for a mutation event to occur , case in which another set of random numbers provides the new genes to insert in the genetic material .    in the last stage of the cycle ,",
    "old and new generations of individuals are combined in the same population group .",
    "afterwards , they are sorted depending on their fidelity , and those which show the highest fidelity are selected as the initial population of the forthcoming cycle .",
    "we derive here the formula @xmath107 for the number of architectures in terms of the number of ancillary qubits @xmath73 and the number of imperfect gates @xmath71 .",
    "we impose the condition of applying each two - qubit gate once and only once , and that the gates are asymmetric , so applying it to qubits @xmath108 is different to apply it to qubits @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , one of the @xmath73 qubits is selected as the control , and one of the remaining @xmath110 as the target .",
    "this process is repeated for each of the @xmath71 gates , so we obtain @xmath111 possibilities . finally , the @xmath71 gates may be applied in any possible order , so there are @xmath84 re - orderings . therefore , by combining both results , the number of total architectures turns into @xmath112 .",
    "we compare the mean error of the integrated cnot gate obtained with ga over many realizations of imperfect gates with the average of the highest fidelity imperfect cnot gate involved in the architecture . for this purpose",
    ", we take a sampling of 1000 different experiments , and we average the error of the best gate .",
    "we estimate the error of the integrated cnot and obtain the percentage of improvement in the error .",
    "these results are summarized in table [ table ] for the cases studied in the main manuscript .",
    "as it is shown , the probability to have a high - fidelity gate is increased when the number of gates is aucmented .",
    "accordingly , there are more possible architectures that minimize the error in the integrated cnot . for the case of @xmath98 and @xmath87",
    ", we obtain similar errors to the ones for @xmath86 .",
    "this could well be because the number of ancillary qubits is of the same order of the involved gates , and then no measurable improvement is expected since there is no cancellation of gate errors .",
    "nevertheless , the optimal relation between number qubits and involved gates is still an open question .",

    "<S> the resilience against changes in the initial conditions of the problem is based on the overheads in the resources . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in the case of electric circuits , when one circuit element fails , the circuit continues working and the designed antennas continue measuring signals even under changes in environmental conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most important limitations in the field of quantum computing  @xcite is the fidelity loss of quantum operations . </S>",
    "<S> quantum error correction protocols  @xcite , which codify logical qubits in several physical qubits , have been proposed and implemented in different quantum technologies , such as linear optics  @xcite , trapped ions  @xcite and superconducting circuits  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we exemplify this with a possible implementation of a high - fidelity controlled - not ( cnot ) modular gate , which is made out of several imperfect cnots . additionally , these architectures show resilience against changes in the gate error . therefore , by combining the concept of digital quantum simulation with ga , it is possible to design robust and versatile digital quantum protocols .    </S>",

    "<S> this method consists in executing a series of discretized interactions , resulting in an effective dynamics similar to the ideal dynamics of the simulated system . </S>",
    "<S> associated to the unitary evolution of hamiltonian @xmath0 , trotter formula reads @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the ideal unitary evolution , @xmath3 is the simulated time , @xmath4 is the number of trotter steps , and @xmath5 are the hamiltonians in the simulating system . on one hand , for a fixed total execution time , </S>",
    "<S> the larger the number of trotter steps is , the lower the digital error of the simulation . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the execution of multiple gates in a quantum system can introduce experimental errors due to decoherence and imperfect gate implementation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , there is a compromise between the number of trotter steps and quantum operations that can be performed by the quantum simulator  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> gas can be employed for outperforming current techniques of digital quantum simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the first step of a digital quantum simulation is the decomposition of the simulated hamiltonian into interactions implementable in the quantum platform , which is a tough task in general . </S>",
    "<S> however , by using gas , it is possible to find a series of gates adapted to the constraints imposed by the quantum simulator , whose resulting interaction is similar to the one of hamiltonian @xmath6 . for this purpose , we need neither to satisfy the condition @xmath0 , nor to use the same execution time for every involved gate . </S>",
    "<S> this not only relaxes the conditions for simulating the dynamics , but also allows us to control the number of gates involved , permitting the possibility of minimizing the experimental error .    </S>",
    "<S> let us assume the situation in which is not possible to compute the ideal dynamics of a short - range interacting hamiltonian , since , for instance the number of particles is too large . by using the trotter - suzuki formula </S>",
    "<S> , it is possible to decompose the interaction into @xmath7 local blocks of @xmath8-interacting particles each , out of @xmath9 total particles . </S>",
    "<S> let us denote by @xmath10 the ideal unitary evolution of the hamiltonian acting on the @xmath11th local block of @xmath8 qubits . </S>",
    "<S> once the total dynamics is decomposed into blocks , each @xmath10 has to be implemented employing the resources available in the experimental platform , as depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ gaprotocol ] . here , gas play an important role , since they provide an architecture for efficiently approximating each @xmath10 by @xmath12 : @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that @xmath8 is sufficiently small to allow the minimization of the error associated with the approximation in a standard computer . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the evaluation function has access to an approximate version of the complete system dynamics , because this is solvable in terms of the trotter expansion . in our algorithm , as an evaluation function , we compare trotter unitary evolution , @xmath16 , for a given number of trotter steps @xmath4 with the unitary evolution obtained from gas , @xmath17 . the evaluation function </S>",
    "<S> is then given by @xmath18  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , for all analyzed examples , the number of gates involved in the ga protocol is lower than in the trotter expansion , which gives positive perspectives for experimental realizations of digital quantum simulations based on this approach .    </S>",
    "<S> the upper bound for the total error @xmath19 of the protocol , is obtained by combining the trotter error with the error of the ga optimization @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the first term is nothing but the digital error  @xcite , so we analyze the second term . </S>",
    "<S> consider that @xmath12 , the unitary provided by the ga , has a matrix error @xmath21 , @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> let us denote by @xmath23 , the operations when extending to the whole hilbert space , where @xmath7 is the number of blocks . the same relation holds for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , therefore , @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> we are now able to compute the error of the ga optimization for a single trotter step , given by @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> we approximate this expression to a first order in @xmath28 , @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 . by computing the norm of the unitary matrices @xmath32 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain @xmath33 , which coincides with the error in each of the subspaces , @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the ga error is bounded by the sum of the errors in each unitary block , which is linear in the number of qubits for the simulation of a short - range interacting hamiltonian . as a final remark , </S>",
    "<S> since both @xmath35 and @xmath36 are unitaries , we would like to point out that the error could also be parametrized by a multiplicative unitary matrix . </S>",
