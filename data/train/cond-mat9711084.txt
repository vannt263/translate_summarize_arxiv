    "it has been discussed at length in the literature @xcite how this hamiltonian can be reduced to an effective hamiltonian for atoms being in their internal ground state in the presence of a single laser beam . for this reason",
    "we will only briefly discuss how this can be done in the presence of several laser beams with different frequencies . in order to avoid spontaneous emission",
    "all laser beams have to be detuned far off resonance so that the population of the excited - state atoms is negligible . in this case",
    "the heisenberg equation of motion for the excited - state field operator can be adiabatically eliminated by assuming that the detunings @xmath21 of the laser beams from the atomic resonance frequency are all in the same order of magnitude and are the largest characteristic frequencies of the system @xcite . the resulting expression for @xmath22",

    "this equation determines the nonlinear dynamics of trapped becs in multiple laser beams and defines the effective hamiltonian @xmath41 for the collective wavefunction @xmath38 .",
    "the design of an optical potential @xmath31 which can rotate the bec by transferring angular momentum was addressed in ref .",

    "the potential @xmath42 of ref .",
    "@xcite is created by four traveling wave laser beams of equal intensity and width much larger than the size of the condensate ( this is usually the case ) so that they can be considered as plane waves .",
    "the laser beams 1 and 2 propagate along the x- and y - direction have the same frequency @xmath43 .",
    "their phases are chosen to be equal at the origin so that the rabi frequencies of the two lasers have the form @xmath44 $ ] and @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "the other two laser beams have the frequency @xmath46 and propagate in directions slightly different from the x- and y- direction with a small angle @xmath47 . the frequency difference @xmath48 is assumed to be so small that the difference between @xmath49 and @xmath50 for any @xmath51 is negligible .",
    "the wavevector of the third laser beam is given by @xmath52 , where @xmath53 denotes the deviation of the wavevectors .",
    "similiarly the 4th laser s wavevector is given by @xmath54 .",
    "the phases are chosen so that laser 4 is in phase with lasers 1 and 2 at the origin whereas the phase of laser 3 is shifted by @xmath55 .",
    "the third rabi frequency is then given by @xmath56 \\omega_0 \\exp [ i ( k x -\\delta k y)]$ ] and the fourth by @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "the described configuration of laser beams leads to the optical potential @xmath58   \\nonumber \\\\ & &    + e^{-i \\phi(t ) } \\big [ e^{i \\delta k x } + i e^{i\\delta    k y } + i e^{-i k(x - y ) + i \\delta k y }    + e^{ik(x - y)+i\\delta kx }    \\big ] \\big \\ } + h.c.\\ ; , \\label{vl2 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have introduced the effective rabi frequency @xmath59 and the time dependent phase @xmath60 . in this section and in the rest of the paper we neglect c - number terms in the optical potential since they only produce an overall phase shift in the wavefunction .    since the wavelength of an optical laser is much smaller than the size of a typical condensate ( several micrometers ) all exponentials in eq . ( [ vl2 ] ) containing the wavevector @xmath61",
    "are rapidly varying over the condensate and therefore average to zero @xcite .",
    "the remaining exponentials , @xmath62 $ ] and @xmath63 $ ] , can be approximated by expressions linear in @xmath64 if the angle @xmath47 is small enough .",
    "the resulting optical potential then takes the form .",
    "@xmath65 it obviously produces a rotating spatially homogeneous force over the size of the condensate .",
    "the rotating force can transfer angular momentum to the condensate .",
    "this can be seen easily by rewriting it in the form @xmath66 because of the commutation relation @xmath67 = \\pm \\hbar ( x\\pm iy)$ ] the operator @xmath68 increases the orbital angular momentum by @xmath69 .",
    "thus , if the frequency difference @xmath70 is nearly resonant with a transition between two trap eigenstates , the angular momentum of the condensate is increased by the force @xcite .    since @xmath31 is produced by laser beams we have to estimate the rate of decoherence of the condensate due to the spontaneous emission of photons which is given by the probability that an atom is excited times the spontaneous emission rate @xmath25 .",
    "the excitation probability for off - resonant light is of the order of @xmath71 . the decoherence time is therefore given by @xmath72 and is therefore much larger than @xmath73 since the detuning is much larger than the natural linewidth .",
    "for instance , if @xmath74 is about 10 ms then for @xmath75 the decoherence time is in the order of a second .",
    "one also has to address the question of how stable the frequencies of the laser beams must be so that @xmath70 is well defined .",
    "it turns out that this poses no problem at all since only the frequency _ difference _",
    "@xmath70 is required to be stable .",
    "since in the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite all four laser beams originate from the same laser source , and since the frequency difference is created by modulating the laser beams , it is clear that only the modulator frequency must be stable .",
    "the stability requirement on the laser beams can therefore easily be fulfilled by any common laser source .",
    "we also point out that laser beams are of course only one possibility to produce a rotating homogeneous force . the same potential could be created by spatially varying and rotating magnetic fields , for instance .",
    "the following analysis of the condensate s motion in the potential ( [ vlvort ] ) therefore covers this case as well .",
    "we now turn to the effect of the optical potential ( [ vlvort ] ) on a condensate trapped in a harmonical potential of the form @xmath76 @xmath77 and @xmath78 denote the trap frequency in the z - direction and in the x - y - plane , respectively .",
    "we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that in the case of an ideal bose gas and a resonant optical potential ( i.e. , @xmath79 ) the condensate rotates around the center of the trap with increasing mean radius but preserving its shape ( comp .",
    "it was also demonstrated that this motion corresponds to a coherent superposition of vortex states @xmath80 ( @xmath81 $ ] , where @xmath82 is the azimuthal angle in the x - y - plane ) with different winding number @xmath83 .    in this section",
    "we extend this result to an interacting bose gas .",
    "we start from eq .",
    "( [ gpeham ] ) including the resonant optical potential ( [ vlvort ] ) .",

    "again the condensate performs a rotation around the trap center whereby the radius of the rotation increases linearly in time .",
    "this result was to be expected since usual interatomic potentials are translation - invariant and therefore affect the center - of - mass motion only indirectly .",
    "it provides an extension of ehrenfest s theorem for interacting bose condensates .",
    "we remark that the result ( [ trajeclsg ] ) deviates from the corresponding result of ref .",
    "@xcite by the factor @xmath93 inside the square brackets .",
    "this difference arises because in ref .",
    "@xcite a rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) has been made .",
    "as usual for rwa the difference is negligible for large times @xmath94 .    to demonstrate that , as in the noninteracting case , the shape of the condensate is not affected by the optical potential we consider the time evolution of the variance of the position operators . using @xmath95 and defining @xmath96 we arrive at @xmath97 because neither the center - of - mass motion nor the optical potential enter into these equations we can infer that the shape of the condensate remains unaffected by the optical potential .",
    "it is worth noting that one can derive from eq .",
    "( [ varianz ] ) the mean energy conservation law @xmath98 + \\omega_z^2 ( \\delta z)^2\\ } + g \\int d^3 u |\\psi     ( \\vec{u})|^4 = \\mbox { const . } \\ ; , \\ ] ] which nicely demonstrates the relation between the interaction energy and the widths of the condensate s wavefunction .",
    "we conclude that , albeit the potential ( [ vlvort ] ) seems to be perfectly suited for this task , neither a pure vortex state nor even a vortex line far away from the center of the trap is created .",
    "however , this does not rule out the possibility to form a vortex state during the formation of the condensate by directly cooling the gas in a rotating trapping potential",
    ". our result may also be helpful to understand why the recent experiments at mit @xcite attempting to observe persistent flows around a potential wall at the trap center by rotating the trap can not achieve the expected result .    to understand why the potential ( [ vlvort ] ) produces a superposition of vortex states rather than a pure one we observe that it couples only neighboring eigenstates of the trap .",
    "this can be seen by expressing the coordinates @xmath99 in terms of the corresponding annihilation operators of the trap ( i.e. , @xmath100 , for instance ) .",
    "since the potential is linear in these operators it couples states with energy @xmath101 ( in the noninteracting case ) to states with energy @xmath102 .",
    "if the coupling is resonant ( @xmath103 ) the potential ( [ vlvort ] ) not only resonantly transforms the ground state to the first excited vortex state , but it also resonantly transfers the @xmath83th vortex state ( with energy @xmath101 ) to the @xmath104th vortex state , because of the equal energy interval between these energy eigenstates . as a result , the long - time evolution of the system driven by the rotating force will lead to a superposition of vortex states with different winding number .",
    "this implies that to create a pure vortex state one must destroy the equal interval between the trap energy levels to avoid the simultaneous excitations of different vortex states .",
    "we will analyze this in the next section",
    "in the preceding sections we have presented a scheme to transfer a harmonically trapped condensate into a rotating state which is a coherent superposition of vortex states .",
    "we also analysed why the scheme does not create a pure vortex state if the trapping potential is harmonic : the equal interval between the energy levels in a harmonic trap causes the condensate to climb up a ladder of resonant transitions into different vortex states .",
    "the situation is different if an anharmonic ( yet still rotationally symmetric ) potential @xmath105 is used in eq .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) for which the interval between the energy levels is not equal .",
    "therefore , if the frequency @xmath106 in the optical potential ( [ vlvort ] ) is choosen to be in resonance with the transition from the ground state to the first excited vortex state , the transition to the next vortex state will in general be out of resonance ( see fig .  2 )",
    "this fact can be exploited to prepare a pure vortex state in an anharmonic trap .    to estimate this",
    "quantitatively we first consider the ideal bose gas and expand the wavevector in terms of the simultaneous eigenstates @xmath107 of the hamiltonian ( [ hcms ] ) and the orbital angular momentum @xmath108 , @xmath109 c_{m , s}(t ) \\psi_{m , s}$ ] .",
    "the eigenstates fulfill the relations @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "it should be noted that the inclusion of the phase factor @xmath112 $ ] in this expansion is equivalent to the description of the system in a frame of reference rotating with angular velocity @xmath113 ( where we left open the possibility that the frequencies can vary in time ) . in this description",
    "the broken symmetry between states of positive ( @xmath114 ) and negative ( @xmath115 ) angular momentum becomes obvious .",
    "since the latter are counterrotating for @xmath116 transitions to these states are highly suppressed .    using this expansion the schrdinger equation ( [ gpe ] ) for the ideal condensate with @xmath117",
    "can be reduced to @xmath118 with @xmath119 .",
    "we assume that , as it is the case for the harmonic potential , @xmath120 has a unique ground state with energy @xmath121 and that the energy levels @xmath122 are well separated , with @xmath123 being the lowest vortex excitation . in this case , if we choose @xmath124 the transition from @xmath125 to @xmath126 is in resonance while the transition from @xmath126 to @xmath127 is detuned by the amount @xmath128 . furthermore ,",
    "if the condition @xmath129 is fulfilled , the transition from @xmath130 to @xmath127 will be highly supressed so that we effectively have a two - level system consisting of the states @xmath125 and @xmath130 .",
    "it is obvious that after a time @xmath131 the complete population will have been transferred to the first excited vortex state , where we have defined the rabi frequency @xmath132 of the transition between @xmath125 and @xmath126 this situation is mathematically very similar to the resonant excitation of the first excited state in an atom by a laser beam . in this case",
    "one can safely neglect all states beside the ground and the first excited state , too .    as a specific example we consider a two - dimensional anharmonic oscillator for which the trapping potential is given by @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the two - dimensional radial variable and @xmath135 determines the strength of the potential .",
    "the neglection of the z - direction does not alter the predictions for the ideal bose gas and is justified for the interacting bose gas if excitations along the z - axis are sufficiently supressed .",
    "approximate eigenstates of the resulting hamiltonian can be obtained by application of ritz s variational method . for later use",

    "this state was found by propagating a gaussian trial wavefunction in imaginary time and normalizing it between each step .",
    "the formation of a vortex state was studied by using the modified split - step method presented in ref .",
    "this consists in approximating the time evolution operator @xmath194 $ ] for small @xmath195 as @xmath196\\exp [ -i \\delta t t\\hbar ] \\exp [ -i \\delta t v/(2 \\hbar)]$ ] , where @xmath197 and @xmath198 denote the kinetic and potential part of the hamiltonian , respectively . the terms containing @xmath198 are diagonal in position space and can easily be applied to the wavefunction .",
    "the term involving @xmath197 is computed by transforming the wavefunction to momentum space by using the fast - fourier - transformation algorithm ( fft ) , applying the operator , and performing the inverse fft .",
    "the physical parameters for the trap and the rb atoms are the same as given at the end of the previous section ( trap strength @xmath199 j / m@xmath168 , trap size @xmath171 m , mass @xmath170 kg ) .",
    "in addition , the two - dimensional nonlinearity parameter @xmath137 was assumed to be @xmath200 j m@xmath201 . for rb atoms the scattering length is about 5 nm .",
    "therefore , if we relate an effective 3-dimensional peak density @xmath202 to the peak of the 2-dimensional wavefunction @xmath203 by @xmath204 we can infer that this choice of @xmath137 corresponds to a peak density @xmath202 of about @xmath205 @xmath206 .",
    "the strength of the optical potential ( [ vlvort ] ) was determined by setting @xmath207 j / m .",
    "it turned out that for this system a grid size of @xmath208 points was accurate enough for the numerical study of the creation process .",
    "the most laborious part of the numerical simulation was to find the proper variation of the frequency difference @xmath186 .",
    "it is not difficult to find an approximation of the physical parameters in eq .",
    "( [ rescond ] ) by use of the variational wavefunctions ( [ vari ] ) .",
    "however , in order to get satisfactory results , these parameters must be determined more precise than the variationally calculated values which deviate from the exact values by up to 10% .",
    "we finally found that the best results are produced if the sinusodial variation is delayed for a time @xmath209 ms to compensate for effects of other modes than @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "thus the frequency difference was given by @xmath210 with @xmath211 s@xmath212 , @xmath213 s@xmath212 , and @xmath214 s@xmath212 .",
    "the numerical results for this choice of parameters are shown in fig .  4 and 5 .",
    "4a - d show the modulus squared of the wavefunction at different times of the evolution ( 0 ms , 87 ms , 142 ms , 247 ms ) .",
    "it shows that for a moderately interacting bose gas in an anharmonic trap an almost pure vortex state can be created .",
    "5 displays the phase of the wavefunction at the same times ( the coarse - grained structure at the border of the figures represents numerical noise ) . fig .",
    "5b demonstrates that during the evolution two vortex lines are created , one of which finally becomes the vortex state in fig.4d and the other slips out of the trap .",
    "this situation can be described reasonably well by assuming that the wavefunction is a superposition of the form @xmath215 , where @xmath216 describes a vortex state with angular momentum @xmath217 .",
    "4b shows the corresponding deformation of the wavefunction .",
    "the modulus of the expansion coefficients @xmath218 can be approximately determined by looking at fig .  5 since the closer one ( two ) vortex lines are to the origin the larger the value of @xmath219 ( @xmath220 ) is .",
    "we also mention that the vortex lines rotate around the origin during the creation process .",
    "this can be seen in an animation of the creation process @xcite .",
    "we have presented a scheme based on four laser beams which induces a spatially homogeneous force to transfer angular momentum to a trapped condensate . for a harmonic trap",
    "this scheme is equivalent to a rotation of the trapping potential around its original position . in this case",
    "the condensate will be prepared into a superposition of pure vortex states , corresponding to a circular motion of the condensate as a whole around the original trap center .",
    "the reason for the creation of a superposition rather than a pure vortex state is that the energy eigenvalues of the trap are equidistant for a harmonic trap .",
    "thus , transitions to neighboring states are simultaneously resonant . in an anharmonic trap",
    "this phenomenon does not occur .",
    "if the intensity of the laser beam is sufficiently low one can tune the transition from the ground state to the first excited vortex state into resonance while leaving the transition to the second excited vortex state far off - resonant .",
    "the interaction - induced energy shift appearing in a non - ideal bec can be compensated by a sinusodial variation of the rotation frequency of the force .",
    "it then is possible to create a pure vortex state in an anharmonic trap .    beside employing an anharmonic trap one alternative method to create a vortex state",
    "is to use raman transitions induced by laguerre - gaussian laser beams , as it was propsed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    "a single laguerre - gaussian laser beam already carries an orbital angular momentum which can be transferred to the condensate .",
    "it is of interest to understand why the proposal with raman transitions also works for a harmonic trapping potential and is not restricted to anharmonic potentials . in the notation used in the present paper",
    "the basic mechanism of the scheme based on raman - transitions is that laser beams of the laguerre - gaussian type couple the condensate , which is initially in the ground state @xmath221 of the trap and the internal state @xmath222 , to a vortex state @xmath223 and the internal state @xmath224 . here",
    "the state vectors are defined by @xmath225 .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is then roughly of the form @xmath226 .",
    "this combination of internal transition and excitation of the center - of - mass motion guarantees that the condensate never can occupy higher vortex states like @xmath227 since the condensate can only oscillate between the states @xmath228 and @xmath229pmarzlin / index.html _"
