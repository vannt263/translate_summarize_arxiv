    "the heavy ion program at large hadron collider ( lhc ) opened up a new era in the physics of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite at higher energies .",
    "one of the most unique properties of the hot matter is the near - perfect fluidity , which was first discovered in the au - au collisions at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite . a standard modeling of the heavy ion collision at rhic consists of several stages ; nucleus - nucleus collision , early thermalization , hydrodynamic evolution , freezeout and hadronic cascade .",
    "the relativistic hydrodynamic model describes the intermediate stage ( @xmath0 1 - 10 fm / c ) where the system is locally equilibrated . on the other hand ,",
    "the pre - collision state is considered to be described by the color glass condensate ( cgc ) where the medium is interpreted as saturated gluons @xcite .",
    "the cgc itself is considered to be successful in reproducing the rapidity distributions and the multiplicities observed at rhic .",
    "the latest pb - pb collisions at lhc , however , revealed that most of the cgc predictions underestimated the multiplicity at mid - rapidity @xcite .",
    "this could be due to the fact that secondary interactions are missing in the comparison . in this study",
    "we estimate the viscous hydrodynamic evolution of the cgc rapidity distributions at rhic and lhc with non - boost invariant flow for the first time @xcite .",
    "we solve the full second order constitutive equations @xcite with both shear and bulk viscosity to investigate the hydrodynamic deformation of the initial distributions .",
    "the viscous hydrodynamic equations consist of the conservation laws and the constitutive equations . in the limit of vanishing chemical potentials we consider ,",
    "the former is the energy - momentum conservation @xmath1 .",
    "we employ the full second - order extended israel - stewart theory @xcite for the latter .",
    "we choose the landau frame where the flow @xmath2 is identified as the eigenvector of @xmath3 .",
    "then the non - equilibrium dynamics in the hydrodynamic system is described by the bulk pressure @xmath4 and the shear stress tensor @xmath5 .",
    "the constitutive equations for the dissipative currents read @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the time- and the space - like derivatives .",
    "@xmath10 is the temperature and @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the transport coefficients .",
    "the angle brackets on indices @xmath15 denote the projection of the traceless symmetric components .",
    "we solve the hydrodynamic equations in the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional relativistic coordinates to discuss non - boost invariant evolution of the medium , although the effects of the transverse flow are neglected .",
    "this is in good contrast to the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic models which are used to discuss transverse dynamics but with boost - invariant flow .",
    "one has to introduce the equation of state and the transport coefficients as inputs to perform hydrodynamic calculations .",
    "here we employ the equation of state from the latest lattice qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "since the transport coefficients are difficult to calculate in the first principle method , the shear viscosity is set to @xmath16 @xcite and the bulk viscosity @xmath17 by extending the method in ref .",
    "@xcite where @xmath18 is the sound velocity .",
    "the second order transport coefficients @xmath13 and @xmath14 are calculated with the ratios of the first and the second order ones given in kinetic theory .",
    "note that they are employed for the purpose of demonstration to see qualitative responses of the systems .",
    "the initial energy distributions are calculated from the monte - carlo version @xcite of kharzeev - levin - nardi ( mc - kln ) model @xcite .",
    "the saturation scale @xmath19 for a nucleus @xmath20 at a transverse coordinate @xmath21 is set as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the momentum fraction of incident partons and @xmath24 the thickness function .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 is related with the rapidity dependence of the distribution ; @xmath26 gets steeper with increasing @xmath25 . here",
    "it is fixed as @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the 5% most central events are used for the construction of the smooth initial conditions .",
    "the initial energy distribution @xmath28 is obtained from the average cgc transverse energy distribution per unit area @xmath29 by identifying momentum rapidity @xmath30 with space - time rapidity @xmath31 . here the initial time is set to @xmath32 fm / c .",
    "the initial distributions for the dissipative currents are not well - known . here",
    "we choose @xmath33 and @xmath34 to employ the same initial energy - momentum tensor for ideal and viscous hydrodynamic cases .",
    "the initial flow rapidity is set to @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "we investigate the rapidity distribution through the entropy distribution per flow rapidity @xmath37 , where the two quantities are related as @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "this is because the ratio of the number density to the entropy density is temperature dependent in the limit of relativistic massless gas , and flow rapidity in a fluid element on average can be identified with momentum rapidity .",
    "note that this is a pure hydrodynamic quantity which does not involve complicated model assumptions such as freezeout and thus one can compare the initial and the final distributions .",

    "( right ) the lhc case with @xmath39 fm / c .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    the cgc rapidity distributions with and without hydrodynamic evolutions for au - au collisions at @xmath40 200 gev and pb - pb collisions at @xmath40 2.76 tev are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rapiditydist ] .",
    "they correspond to the rhic and the lhc settings .",
    "the distributions are always flattened in ideal hydrodynamic systems due to the entropy flux to forward rapidity driven by the pressure gradient in rapidity direction .",
    "on the other hand , the distributions in viscous hydrodynamic systems are enhanced due to the entropy production .",
    "the entropy production could be larger because the viscous coefficients here are close to the conjectured lower boundaries .",
    "the final times are chosen so that the temperatures at mid - rapidity are sufficiently near the qcd pseudo - critical temperature .",
    "for the current parameter settings , the equal - time surface is not so different than the isothermal one because the distributions do not change much after @xmath41 fm / c .",
    "the hydrodynamic modifications differ in magnitude for the rhic and the lhc cases .",
    "if , as indicated in the current parameter settings , the cgc rapidity distribution is flattened at rhic , the actual initial distribution needs to be steeper , _",
    "i.e. _ , the true @xmath25 has to be larger than the current value .",
    "since the hydrodynamic effects are accidentally cancelled at lhc , it translates into larger multiplicity at lhc .",
    "this could be one of the candidates to explain the underprediction of the multiplicity at lhc by the cgc .",
    "we developed the theoretical and numerical scheme of the full second order viscous hydrodynamic model for the longitudinal expansion .",
    "the cgc initial rapidity distributions are visibly modified during the hydrodynamic stage due to the interplay between the two factors : ( i ) entropy production from non - equilibrium processes and ( ii ) entropy flux to forward rapidity caused by non - boost invariance .",
    "the result implies that readjustment of the cgc parameters is necessary , which could be one of the key factors for explaining the gap between the cgc predictions and the lhc data @xcite .",
    "the results indicate that non - boost invariant hydrodynamic evolution together with viscosity is indispensable for developing an integrated picture of the heavy ion collisions .",
    "detailed analyses on the parameter dependences will also be explored elsewhere @xcite .",
