    "a challenging problem in nuclear physics is to calculate nuclear properties microscopically , using realistic nuclear forces . for light systems ( @xmath0 ) , the schrdinger equation can be solved with a high degree of accuracy and both ground state properties and reaction cross sections have been calculated  @xcite .    for heavier systems , the green s function monte carlo ( gfmc )",
    "method @xcite as well as the no - core shell model ( ncsm ) approach  @xcite have been successfully applied for the _ ab initio _ description of nuclear properties , using realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) and three - nucleon forces .",
    "gfmc calculations , while more accurate , are limited to masses up to @xmath1 , while the ncsm can handle a larger range of masses , up to @xmath2 and beyond  @xcite .",
    "however , for a@xmath3 a big obstacle is encountered if one wants to calculate reaction observables involving states in the continuum , because of the enormous difficulties in calculating many - body scattering states .",
    "such difficulties can be avoided using integral transforms , which reduce the continuum problem to a bound - state - like problem  @xcite , so that only bound state techniques are required .",
    "while not all integral transforms are appropriate for a practical use  @xcite ( the inversion of the transforms is an `` ill posed problem ''  @xcite ) , the integral transform with a lorentz kernel  @xcite appears to be the practical tool for such calculations .",
    "in fact , it has allowed the calculation of electromagnetic reaction cross sections beyond break - up thresholds of nuclei from @xmath4  @xcite to a=7  @xcite .",
    "such calculations have also been possible thanks to the use of the effective interaction hyperspherical harmonic ( eihh )  @xcite approach , a very accurate bound state technique , which , similar to the ncsm approach , uses the concept of an effective interaction to speed up the convergence of the basis expansions . in particular , by means of the lorentz integral transform ( lit ) method combined with the eihh technique , total photoabsorption cross sections of six- @xcite and seven - body nuclei  @xcite with semirealistic nn potentials have been calculated . in a very recent work  @xcite the @xmath5he total photoabsorption cross section",
    "could even be calculated with a realistic nuclear force ( two- and three - body potential ) . moreover",
    ", a similar formalism has been recently applied to describe exclusive electromagnetic processes of the four - body nuclear system with a semirealistic potential  @xcite .",
    "while the eihh and ncsm approaches are rather similar , only the latter has made use of realistic interactions in calculations with @xmath6 .",
    "indeed , ncsm has the advantage that one can use an equivalent slater determinant basis , allowing description of a larger range of masses .",
    "therefore , it is of great interest to investigate the possibility of applying the ncsm to the lit equations .",
    "in fact , if one could obtain reliable results in this way , the possibility to study also reactions on heavier nuclei by means of realistic _ ab initio _ approaches would open up .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to investigate the applicability of the ncsm approach to the solutions of the bound - state equations required by the lit method .",
    "the similarities between the eihh and the ncsm makes the task straightforward , in principle . on the other hand",
    ", the practical implementation of the method , especially concerning the problems of convergence , might lead to difficulties .    in the following , we present the results of a test consisting in calculating , within the eihh and ncsm approaches , the lit of the four - body response functions to two different excitation operators . because of the convergence properties , the input interaction is the simple minnesota ( mn )  @xcite potential .",

    "the inclusive cross sections of reactions induced by perturbative external probes are generally written in terms of the so - called response functions defined as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 represents the energy transferred by the probe , and @xmath9 the excitation operator .",
    "wave functions and energies of the ground and final states of the perturbed system are denoted by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .    in the lit method  @xcite",
    "one obtains @xmath12 after the inversion of an integral transform with a lorentzian kernel @xmath13 the state @xmath14 is the unique solution of the inhomogeneous `` schrdinger - like '' equation @xmath15 because of the presence of an imaginary part @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) and the fact that the right - hand side of this same equation is localized , one has an asymptotic boundary condition similar to a bound state .",
    "thus , one can apply bound - state techniques for its solution , and , in particular , expansions over basis sets of localized functions . in the present paper",
    "we solve eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) using both the ncsm and eihh methods , which will be briefly described below .    in both cases",
    "we evaluate the lit by calculating the quantity @xmath17 directly  @xcite via the lanczos algorithm .",
    "hence , one finds that the lit can be written as a continuous fraction @xmath18 in terms of the lanczos coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the quantity @xmath23 is the zero - th moment of the distribution @xmath12 and , therefore , equivalent to the total strength induced by the excitation operator ( non - energy weighted sum rule ) . a parameter - free smooth response function @xmath12 is obtained by inversion of the integral transform of eq .",

    "we would like to note that similar applications have already been used in the past  @xcite for evaluating response functions by means of shell - model calculations in terms of the so - called `` lanczos response '' ( lr ) . in these cases , lr is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the number of lanczos iterations , while @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the eigenvalues and transition strengths obtained with the lanczos algorithm , respectively . starting with eq .",
    "( [ lrdelta ] ) , one usually replaces the @xmath28 function by a resolution function ( lorentzian or gaussian ) with a width parameter appropriate to the experiment ( a typical value is @xmath29 mev )  @xcite , or one evaluates the running integral @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the break - up threshold energy of the system .",
    "while the lr has the same underlying physical content as @xmath32 , since in both approaches one starts from the poles and the residues of the green s function , it is evident that the information is processed in a different way .",
    "in fact , in the lit method eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) is regarded as an integral transform of the response function , which is then recovered via numerical inversion . in this approach",
    ", one typically chooses larger values of @xmath16 (  @xmath33 mev ) , of the order of the strunctures expected in the response function , such that @xmath34 can be calculated with the sufficient numerical precision that allows a stable inversion .",
    "after the inversion one recovers a smooth response , which is independent of @xmath16 in a large range of values for this parameter .",
    "the eihh and ncsm approaches are spectral resolution methods , where one performs an expansion of the schrdinger wave function in terms of a complete set of basis states : the hyperspherical - harmonics ( hh ) functions in the eihh case , and the ho basis functions in the ncsm case .",
    "obviously , due to computational limitations , the basis has to be truncated .",
    "the truncated set of states forms the so - called model or @xmath35-space , and the excluded basis functions build its complementary @xmath36-space , such that the sum @xmath37 spans the total hilbert space .",
    "it is well - known that for a given nn interaction the ho and the hh expansions converge rather slowly . in order to accelerate the convergence pattern ,",
    "both methods make use of an effective interaction introduced by navrtil _ et .",
    "@xcite , which follows a unitary transformation approach .",
    "for the finite @xmath35-space , the corresponding effective interaction is obtained by means of a unitary transformation  @xcite . in general",
    ", the exact effective interaction for an @xmath38-body system will have irreducible @xmath38-body matrix elements , even if the bare interaction is only two - body , and its construction requires the exact solution of the initial problem . since the solution for the @xmath38-body problem is the primary goal of the approach , an exact calculation of the effective interaction is not practical , and one has to resort to approximations .",
    "thus , the effective interaction is approximated as a sum of @xmath39-body effective interaction terms ( @xmath40 , derived from the solution of the @xmath39-body problem .",
    "this procedure is called the cluster approximation , and in practice , we use @xmath41 or @xmath42 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is then obtained by replacing the bare interaction in the @xmath38-body hamiltonian by the effective one .",
    "however , because of the approximation introduced in order to compute the effective interaction , the resulting eigenvalues of the effective hamiltonian do not exactly reproduce the values in the full space , the signature being a dependence of the observables on the parameters of the model space .",
    "for a given cluster approximation , the eigenenergies converge to the bare ones by increasing the size of the model space . and in the limit @xmath43 this procedure becomes exact @xcite .",
    "alternately , one can obtain convergence in a fixed model space by increasing the cluster size , as in this case the approximate effective interaction converges to the exact one .    in the ncsm ,",
    "one works in an ho basis , and the @xmath35-space is spanned by states with the total number of ho quanta @xmath44 . for the purpose of this paper ,",
    "we neglect three - body forces and use local interactions , although the non - local interactions do not present an impediment  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the intrinsic hamiltonian describing a system of @xmath38 nucleons is simply @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 being the momentum and the position vectors of the _ _ i__th particle , respectively ; @xmath48 being the nn potential ; and @xmath49 the nucleon mass . in order to facilitate the use of the convenient ho basis for evaluating the effective interaction , eq .",

( [ homega3 ] ) in a subspace @xmath57 of the full three - body hilbert space .",
    "this approximation introduces dependence on the oscillator parameter @xmath53 so that one has to search for a range of @xmath53-values that minimizes such a dependence .",

    "a more detailed description of the derivation of the operator @xmath55 can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in a consistent approach",
    ", one should use effective transition operators , derived by means of the same transformation that determines the effective interaction .",
    "while the renormalization at the three - cluster level has not been investigated for general operators , studies of the latter in the two - body cluster approximation have shown little effect of the renormalization for long - range observables @xcite .",
    "although it is conceivable that a renormalization at the three - body cluster level can show some improvement for long - range operators in smaller model spaces , this task is extremely demanding and not justified since we obtain model space independent results in the largest model spaces used in this work .",
    "the present four - nucleon @xmath35-space calculations are performed in a properly antisymmetrized translationally invariant ho basis , as described in  @xcite , where the interested reader can find details on how to compute an one - body translationally invariant operator in such a basis .    in the eihh method",
    "@xcite the calculation is performed with the hh basis and the spaces @xmath35 and @xmath36 are defined by means of the hyperspherical quantum number @xmath61 .",
    "thus , the model space includes all the hh functions with @xmath62 .",
    "the intrinsic hamiltonian in the hyperspherical coordinates is given by @xmath63 + \\sum_{i < j=1}^{a}v(\\vec{r}_{i}-\\vec{r}_{j})\\;,\\label{hh1}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the hyperradius and @xmath65 contains derivatives with respect to @xmath64 only .",
    "the grand - angular momentum operator @xmath66 is a function of the variables of particles @xmath38 and @xmath67 and of @xmath68 , the grand angular momentum operator of the residual subsystem @xcite . unlike in the case of ncsm calculation , in this work",
    "we use a two - body cluster approximation for eihh , which already yields an excellent convergence pattern .",
    "the starting point for the construction of the effective interaction is a two - body - like hamiltonian , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the relative coordinate between particles @xmath38 and @xmath71 , but the total hyperspherical kinetic energy is considered . due to the presence of the hyperradius @xmath64 , which is a collective coordinate , the resulting effective interaction produces a sort of `` medium correction '' .",
    "moreover , since it depends also on the @xmath72 quantum number of the @xmath73 particle subsystem , it is state dependent .",
    "the sum of these leads to a faster rate of convergence .",
    "the hh functions are constructed starting from the relative jacobi coordinates , thus the center of mass motion is removed from the very beginning .",
    "the fermionic basis states are obtained by coupling spin - isospin states , _",
    "i.e. _ , states that belong to irreducible representations of the permutation group @xmath74 , with spatial hh states to yield completely antisymmetric basis functions .",
    "the basis is constructed by using the powerful algorithms of @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to investigate the reliability of the ncsm approach for the description of inclusive response functions via the lit method , and not to give a realistic prediction of those response functions .",
    "therefore , although applications of the ncsm and the eihh have already been performed and published using realistic nn forces as well as theoretical three nucleon forces , for the purpose of our comparison it is more convenient to employ the semi - realistic mn  @xcite potential .",
    "the advantage of the mn potential is that it consists of gaussian - type potentials and has a rather soft core , leading to good convergence rate for both the ncsm and the eihh .",
    "we present results for two operators different in isospin nature and range , giving the leading contribution to low - energy electromagnetic reactions .",
    "these are the isovector dipole and the isoscalar quadrupole operators , respectively : @xmath75    the ncsm calculations are also carried out for four different ho frequencies ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 mev ) , in order to study the dependence of the resulting lit on this parameter and to provide an estimate for the theoretical uncertainties .",

    "the origin of this behavior is related to the fall - off of the wave function for the ho potential well .",

    "( [ 2 ] ) ] is influenced by the convergence of its two components : ( i ) the total strength @xmath81 , which was discussed earlier ; ( ii ) the residual continued fraction of lanczos coefficients .",
    "while the first is governed by the convergence of the ground state ( non - energy weighted sum rule ) , the results for the continued fraction have a further dependence on the @xmath109 model space .",
    "for this reason , the convergence pattern of the lit has to be studied as a function of the model space for the ground state as well as for the lit state @xmath110 .",
    "due to the parity difference of the two states , the values of @xmath79 and @xmath78 chosen for the model spaces are even for the ground state and odd for @xmath111 state , respectively .",
    "figure  [ figure3 ] shows that the convergence of the lit for eihh is fast and accurate over the entire range of @xmath103 . the same plot for the ncsm results at @xmath83 mev , presented in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] , reveals a slower convergence rate .",
    "in particular , we notice that , unlike for the eihh , the high @xmath103 tails of the ncsm results show oscillations and a satisfactory quenching of such oscillations is obtained only for the biggest model space ( @xmath107 ) .",

    "in a given model space , for smaller ho frequencies one obtains a better sampling of the complex - energy continuum , and therefore a more accurate convergence of the lit , especially in the low-@xmath103 region ; on the other hand , faster convergence is achieved when the ho length parameter is chosen close to the size of the state to be described , and , therefore , larger @xmath112 values are preferrable for describing the ground state . as a consequence , in the particular case of the @xmath5he nucleus ,",

    "[ figure4 ] .",
    "the different behavior of the two methods with respect to the size of the @xmath35-space used in the calculation is related both to the differences in the shape and asymptotic behavior of the ho and hh base states  @xcite , and , more importantly , to the actual number of states , included in the expansion .",
    "we would like to point out that , due to the extra flexibility of the hh basis in the hyperradial part of the expansion , for the same value of @xmath78 and @xmath79 , the number of totally antisymmetric basis states in the two approaches is significantly different .",

    "the calculation of the total strength for the quadrupole transition employs an expansion over an intermediate set of basis states with @xmath127 . in particular , for the ncsm values in the largest model space ( @xmath125 ) , we omit the contribution of the transitions to the @xmath127 states with @xmath128 , as a full calculation in this case would be out of reach . in principle , one could evaluate the loss of strength induced by such an approximation ( introduced due to computational limitations ) , using the non - energy weighted sum rule and calculating the expectation value of the operator @xmath129 directly on the ground state , as was done for the dipole response .",

    "the chosen transitions have allowed us to perform the test for two operators different in isospin nature and range . in both cases",
    "our model study has shown that the ncsm can be successfully applied to the solution of the bound - state - like equations required by the lit methods . however , due to differences in the asymptotics of the wave functions and in the strength distribution in the continuum achieved with the ho and hh expansions , the practical implementation of the method , especially concerning the problems of convergence , might lead to difficulties . in particular , to ensure a small numerical uncertainty in the response function , obtained by numerical inversion  @xcite , one has to achieve a very good accuracy in the calculation of the lit .",
    "consequently , it is necessary to find a range of ho frequencies , for which both the ground and the excited states of the system present good convergence properties . the actual choice of @xmath112 depends on both the nucleus under consideration and the range of the transition operator . for @xmath5he",
    "we find that frequencies in the range @xmath131 have the demanded characteristics for both the isovector dipole and isoscalar quadrupole excitations .",
    "our main conclusion is that , in this benchmarking calculation with a semirealistic nn interaction , the ncsm is able to reach the level of precision required for the description of continuum responses via the lit method and to obtain equivalent results as those found with the eihh method .",
    "because of the ability of ncsm to handle heavier mass nuclei than the eihh , the present result opens the door for possible lit investigations of heavier nuclei .",
    "however , the large model spaces needed in the ncsm calculations in order to achieve the necessary accuracy will require considerable thought and effort , but may be assisted by the use of effective field - theory two- and three - body interactions , which should be softer .",
    "since lit requires a good description of the ground - state wave function , and , at the same time , a fine enough discretization of the complex - energy continuum , one could use a mixed - mode approach in the spirit of ref .",
    "thus , one could use basis states with a frequency that ensures fast convergence for the ground state , adding also basis states of smaller frequencies , which would allow a better discretization of the complex - energy continuum at low energies , and basis states corresponding to larger frequencies for a better description of the response at higher energies .",
    "this approach would require , however , a more involved numerical technique which can be adapted for our no - core calculations in a jacobi basis .",
    "moreover , such a method is not immediately applicable to slater determinant basis codes , which are much more efficient for calculations in heavier nuclei , because of the more delicate treatment of the center - of - mass motion required in such a case .",
    "while such an approximation is under consideration , we leave its possible implementation for future work .",
