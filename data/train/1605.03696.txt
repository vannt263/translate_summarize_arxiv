    "a long time ago it was found @xcite that the belinskii , khalatnikov and lifshitz ( bkl ) conjecture @xcite , concerning generic spacelike singularity , extends to generic timelike singularity .",
    "both conjectures are based on the generalization of possible solutions to the dynamics of the bianchi ix model near spacelike and timelike singularities .",
    "these are general analytical considerations based on reasonable assumptions , which are not rigorous mathematically so the bkl is not called a theorem , but conjecture or scenario . however , due to numerical simulations done in the meantime ( see , @xcite and references therein ) , the bkl scenario is commonly believed to underly the generic solution to general relativity .",
    "recently , there appeared two papers with contradictory conclusions verifying the considerations concerning the solution to the bianchi ix dynamics near the timelike singularity in terms of the iwasawa decomposition of the metric @xcite .",
    "this was our motivation to analyse again the dynamics of the bianchi ix spacetime , but this time both analytically and numerically .",
    "it is so because the dynamics is defined by highly nonlinear coupled system of equations and exact analytical solutions are not available .",
    "we consider the dynamics of the vacuum bianchi ix model which is known to be similar to the case with the perfect fluids having soft equations of state such as dust or radiation .",
    "the dynamics of the bianchi ix spacetime near spacelike and timelike singularities turn out to be similar of oscillatory type .",
    "the main difference is that in the latter case there exist singular solutions with diverging volume densities , but finite curvature invariants .",
    "however , in both cases there occur solutions which are asymptotically singular with blowing up curvature invariants .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : the next two sections specify the dynamics of the bianchi ix near spacelike and timelike singularities .",
    "the further two sections present the solutions to the dynamical equations , including some approximate analytical and numerical treatments .",
    "we conclude in the last section .",
    "the metric in a synchronous frame has the form @xmath0 in what follows we use the system of units in which @xmath1 and the definitions and notations of the book @xcite .",
    "in particular , the signature ( @xmath2 ) is used and the roman indices run over @xmath3 . in this section ( but not in the section [ x ] ) the greek indices @xmath4 take values @xmath5 and label the spatial coordinates .",
    "the coordinate @xmath6 is timelike , so we exclude the solutions describing strong gravitational waves @xcite , naked singularities @xcite and other spacetimes which are not interesting for cosmology @xcite .",
    "the singularity corresponds to @xmath7 .",

    "an infinite number of oscillations occur during each of these intervals .",
    "they are separated by the so - called kasner epochs , each of which can be described by the left - hand sides of ( [ e6 ] ) - ( [ e9 ] ) with the right - hand sides being neglected . during these epochs the spacetime is similar to the well - known kasner metric @xcite @xmath71 where the kasner indices @xmath72 satisfy the conditions @xmath73 thus one of them is negative and other two are positive .    more specifically , the functions during each kasner s epoch have the form @xmath74 where @xmath75 . for the function @xmath76 we get @xmath77 where @xmath78 with some set of kasner indices @xmath72 satisfying conditions ( [ eqq16 ] ) .",
    "the increasing of the function with a negative kasner index leads to the increasing the corresponding terms in the right - hand sides of ( [ e6 ] ) - ( [ e8 ] ) and a transfer from one epoch to another . for instance , if @xmath79 , then this transition has the form @xmath80 @xmath81 where @xmath82 , and where @xmath83 is the value of @xmath70 corresponding to a maximum of @xmath84 .",
    "after that we have a new epoch with a negative kasner index associated with @xmath85 or @xmath86 .",
    "the entire process of evolution of the metric is generally made up of successive periods named eras ( each consisting of a number of epochs ) , during which distances along two of the axes oscillate , while the distance along the third axis changes , to some extent , independently . in fig .",

    "( [ e8 ] ) with initial values and derivatives satisfying the condition ( [ e9 ] ) ]    one can choose the direction of evolution towards the singularity in two ways , namely along or opposite to the @xmath70 increase .",

    "if @xmath91 , we have @xmath89 as @xmath92 ; if @xmath93 , the vanishing of the volume occurs as @xmath94 ( where @xmath95 at @xmath96 ) . in the bianchi ix vacuum cosmological model",
    "we can consider the spacetime ( [ e5 ] ) at any @xmath70 from @xmath97 to @xmath98 .",
    "there is no singularities at finite values of @xmath70 .",
    "suppose , for instance , that the function @xmath84 increases when approaching the singularity at finite @xmath70 , while two others decrease , i.e. @xmath99 .",
    "then , we can leave only the main terms in the right hand sides of ( [ e6 ] ) - ( [ e8 ] ) so we get the solution ( [ eqq3 ] ) in which , however , @xmath84 decreases near the singularity .",

    "now , let us assume that two of the functions , for example @xmath84 and @xmath85 , increase when approaching the singularity , while the other one changes slowly , i.e. we have the case @xmath100 .",

    "is a concave function .",
    "this fact contradicts to our assumption .    finally , let assume that all three functions increase when approaching the singularity .",
    "the system of equations ( [ e6 ] ) - ( [ e9 ] ) is invariant with respect to the transformation @xmath102 so the characteristic period of @xmath70 , e.g. a duration of epoch has to decrease near the singularity .",
    "this has to be accompanied by increasing of values of @xmath103 from ( [ eqq12 ] ) . but",
    "a change of kasner epoch ( [ eqq3 ] ) leads to its decreasing @xcite @xmath104 which again leads to the contradiction .",
    "we conclude that the occurrence of the singularity at finite value of @xmath70 is impossible .",
    "can all three functions decrease ? in this case we can neglect the right - hand sides of ( [ e6 ] ) - ( [ e8 ] ) and get the asymptotic form near the singularity @xmath105 if the singularity corresponds to @xmath106 , we have @xmath107 , and if the singularity occurs at @xmath108 , we take @xmath109 . in both cases",

    "one can repeat all the arguments from section [ rd ] with a few changes to show that there is an oscillation regime near the timelike singularity as it was done in @xcite .",
    "the difference in signs of the right - hand sides of ( [ e6 ] ) - ( [ e8 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) - ( [ eq8 ] ) is not important when we consider an oscillating mode , because among functions @xmath87 only one is increasing and acts as a perturbation .",
    "could the singularity in ( [ eq6 ] ) - ( [ eq9 ] ) occur at some finite @xmath65 ? in what follows",
