    "these observations are difficult to reconcile with some current idealized formation scenarios for elliptical galaxies .",
    "a simple conclusion from the data is that most early - type galaxies can neither have fully formed in a simple monolithic collapse nor a binary merger of gas - rich disks at high redshift , unless their increase in size can be explained by secular processes such as adiabatic expansion driven by stellar mass loss and/or strong feedback @xcite . additionally , simple passive evolution of the stellar population is in contradiction with observations of local ellipticals @xcite .",
    "+ dry ( i.e. gas - poor , collisionless ) mergers and stellar accretion events are the prime candidates for the strong mass and size evolution of stellar spheroids at @xmath5 @xcite as the additional presence of a dissipative component in a major merger event would limit the size increase ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the observed ellipticals are already very massive at high redshift , thus we expect from the shape of the mass function that minor mergers should be much more common than major mergers until z=0 .",
    "massive early - type galaxies may undergo not more than one major merger ( with typically low cool gas content , see also @xcite ) since @xmath6 ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) with a significant contribution from minor mergers for the mass buildup @xcite .",
    "the low number of observed major early - type mergers is also supported by theoretical evidence that massive ( @xmath7 ) halos at @xmath8 typically experience only one major merger or less until @xmath9 and minor mergers are much more common @xcite . on average , this is not enough to account for the required mass and size growth ( see also @xcite ) as major dry mergers at most increase the size of a simple one component system by a factor of two and allowing for dark matter halos reduces the size growth further @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we use , as a proof of principle , a very high resolution cosmological simulation of the formation of a spheroid with no major mergers below @xmath10 in combination with simple scaling relations to show that the observed rapid size growth and density evolution of spheroidal galaxies can be explained by minor mergers and small accretion events .",
    "the problem is computationally very expensive . at high",
    "redshift the observed ellipticals have half - mass sizes of @xmath11 with accreting subsystems of even smaller size . as we know from isolated merger simulations ( see e.g. @xcite ) , to resolve such a system reasonably well we require a force softening of 10% of the effective radius , which in our case is of the order of @xmath12 and we require particle numbers of @xmath13 to simulate the galaxy in a full cosmological context over a hubble time . finally , to accurately follow the kinematics high force and integration accuracy are required .",

    "( orbital parameters from cosmological simulations indicate that most halos merge on parabolic orbits ) , the total energy of the final system is    @xmath26    the mass of the final system is @xmath27 .",
    "therefore the ratio of the final to initial mean square speeds is    @xmath28    similarly , the ratio of the final to initial gravitational radius is    @xmath29    and for the ratio of the densities we get    @xmath30    if during one or more mergers the initial stellar system increases its mass by a factor of two then @xmath31 .",

    "as we have shown before the evolution in surface brightness is mainly driven by an evolution in surface density and not by stellar evolution .    at z=3",

    "the z=0 values of the simulated galaxy are close to the simple prediction , however , the size increase as well as the decrease in density and dispersion are more moderate .",
    "this is however expected as the real evolution of the system is more complex and there is non - negligible in - situ star formation between z=3 and z=1 .",
    "still , the simple scaling relations for stellar accretion represent the evolution of the system from z=3 to z=0 very well .",
    "however , observations of more massive ellipticals than the one presented here indicate an even stronger size increase @xcite .",
    "this effect can be expected if the assembly of more massive galaxies is even more dominated by minor mergers and stellar accretion .",
    "in particular , the drop in velocity dispersion is in qualitative agreement with first direct observations by @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite have reported a relatively weak evolution of the density within fixed 1kpc of only a factor 2 - 3 .",
    "this also is in qualitative agreement with our simulation which shows a decrease of only a factor 1.5 from z=2 to z=0 .",
    "we also note that the stellar population of the system is already evolved at high redshift . at @xmath8",
    "the galaxy has a stellar mass of @xmath85 and a local star formation rate of only @xmath86 and an average stellar age of @xmath87 .",
    "in this paper we show that the observed size and density evolution of massive spheroids agrees with what is to be expected from a high resolution cosmological simulation of a system which grows at late times predominantly by minor mergers and accretion of stars .",
    "we can successfully apply simple scaling relations derived from the virial theorem to demonstrate that that the size increase and decrease in density and velocity dispersion is a natural consequence of mass assembly by much less massive stellar systems and accretion @xcite and can not be explained by mass assembly histories dominated by major stellar mergers .    in the simulation , a first phase @xmath88 dominated by in - situ star formation from inflowing cold gas ( see e.g.",
    "@xcite and references therein ) produces a massive and dense stellar system with sizes @xmath89 .",
    "this phase of the formation of the cores of ellipticals is followed by an extended phase @xmath90 with little in - situ star formation but significant accretion of stellar material .",
    "this material can be stripped at larger radii and increases the size of the system with time . at the same time",
    "the central concentration is reduced by dynamical friction from the surviving cores ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the apparent size increase is caused by the initial dominance of the in - situ component being heated and , at larger radii , overshadowed ultimately by the accreted stars . from z=3",
    "to z=0 the effective radius of the system increases by a factor of 3.5 with a decrease in the effective density of more than an order of magnitude and a decrease in velocity dispersion of 20% , in good agreement with predictions from simple scaling relations for the accretion of minor mergers .",
    "detailed investigations of dark matter simulations ( see e.g. @xcite ) as well as recent observations ( see e.g. @xcite ) on the mass assembly mechanisms of early - type galaxies and their dark matter halos demonstrate the significance of minor mergers .",
    "in addition , due to the shape of the mass function , massive systems at high redshift are more likely to experience minor mergers , than lower mass galaxies .",
    "if the size evolution is in general driven by minor mergers we would expect a differential size increase , e.g. more massive high redshift systems grow larger than lower mass systems . at the same time",
    "minor mergers do also play an important role for the gravitational heating of halo gas , thereby suppressing the formation of new stars @xcite .",
    "a picture of a two phase formation process for massive spheroidal galaxies has a number of virtues . in the first dissipative phase at high redshift stars form quickly and",
    "build the compact progenitor of present - day ellipticals .",
    "in fact , it seems of minor importance if the gas is funneled to the center through streams or mergers of extended gas dominated disks ( see e.g. @xcite ) as long as it happens on a short timescale .",
    "the stars formed at this early phase are expected to be significantly enriched in alpha - elements as expected from observations @xcite and form the compact core of the elliptical galaxy .",
    "later on metal - poor stars from smaller systems are accreted and form the halo of the galaxy resulting in the observed metalicity gradient .",
    "this inside out formation scenario is also made plausible by recent observations of @xcite .",
    "there is an important test of the picture presented in this paper .",
    "if correct , then the outer parts of massive giant ellipticals will tend to be old , blue , metal - poor and relatively uniform from galaxy to galaxy since they are all composed essentially of the debris from tidally destroyed accreted small systems .",
