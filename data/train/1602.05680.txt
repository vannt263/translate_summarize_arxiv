    "the high field and low temperature ( hflt ) superconducting ( sc ) phase of cecoin@xmath1 is a novel type of state of matter , and a lot of experimental and theoretical studies have been performed to obtain the genuine picture on this phase . in this phase , the @xmath0-wave pairing and a sdw orders coexist , although this sdw order is absent in the normal phase@xcite just above @xmath2 .",
    "early experimental data have already indicated that this sc material has an unusually strong ppb effect .",
    "based on theoretical analysis@xcite of subsequent experimental facts on the vortex lattice rigidity@xcite , nmr@xcite , and doping effects@xcite , it has been argued that the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) sc state , where a sc order parameter @xmath3 is spontaneously modulated in real space due to a strong paramagnetic pair - breaking ( ppb)@xcite , is realized in the hflt phase .",
    "further , it has been clarified @xcite that an interplay between the @xmath0-wave pairing symmetry and the strong ppb creates a sdw order in contrast to the widespread view that the sc and magnetic orders are competitive with each other . this theoretical picture on the sdw ordering based only on the strong ppb explains the main features of the sdw order observed through a neutron scattering experiment@xcite and an nmr experiment@xcite .    in our previous works@xcite",
    ", it has been stressed that the ppb - induced coexistence of @xmath0-wave sc and the sdw orders occurs , broadly speaking , with two origins .",
    "firstly , suppression of the sdw ordering due to a sc excitation gap is weakened due to ppb , and , secondly , the sdw ordering is enhanced due to the sign change of the @xmath0-wave gap function @xmath4 in k - space where @xmath5 is satisfied with @xmath6 .",
    "the importance of k - space sign change of the gap function for the ppb - induced sdw ordering have also been discussed elsewhere@xcite in relation to a ppb - induced shift of a resonance peak .",
    "furthermore , it has also been shown that the ppb - induced sdw ordering is largely enhanced by the fflo modulation of @xmath3 parallel to the field@xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been shown @xcite that the presence of such a longitudinal fflo spatial modulation in the hflt phase explains the switching of the sdw @xmath7-vector via the in - plane rotation of the applied magnetic field seen in cecoin@xmath1 @xcite .    nevertheless , it is surprising that this sdw order in _ real _ space tends to favor the region with a nonvanishing sc order rather than the vicinity of the vortex cores@xcite .",
    "then , one may wonder how the magnetic order favoring coexistence with a non - vanishing sc order in real space can coexist with the sc order even in k - space .",
    "this naive question has motivated us to investigate details of k - space structure of this ppb - induced sdw order in a @xmath0-wave sc phase .    in this paper , we present a theoretical analysis on k - space structure of the coexisting @xmath0-wave sc and sdw orders induced by a strong ppb effect .",
    "it is found that the sdw order develops in the k - space region near the @xmath0-wave gap node , where the sc order is suppressed by ppb , and the nesting condition of the fermi surface ( fs ) is satisfied .",
    "effects of the sign change of the @xmath0-wave gap function around each gap node on the coexistence of these orders are discussed through a comparison with the results of an artificial model in which the gap function with no sign change in k - space is assumed .",
    "it is shown that , due to the sign change of the gap function , the @xmath0-wave sc and sdw orders are enhanced cooperatively even in k - space , and the coexistence of these orders is largely stabilized by this mutual enhancement .",
    "moreover , it has been found that , in the case of a large fs curvature , a sdw staggered moment is maximal _ slightly below _ the sc transition field @xmath8 due to the mismatch of the nesting hotspot and the k - space region where the sc order is suppressed by ppb .",
    "these results indicate the presence of a profound mechanism of the ppb - induced coexistence of @xmath0-wave sc and sdw orders in the light of the k - space structure of these orders .",
    "the mechanism of the ppb - induced sdw ordering has also been discussed by another research group @xcite , in which the importance of the nesting between quasiparticle pockets appearing in k - space due to strong ppb , on which the lower excitation energy in a pure sc phase is equal to zero , has been stressed .",
    "the theoretical works of refs . are based on essentially the same model , and thus , if the quasiparticle pockets contribution is dominant , their contribution might also be reflected in k - space results in the framework of our previous works @xcite . in the sense of clarifying a genuine picture on the coexistence of the two orders ,",
    "the present comprehensive study on the k - space structure of these coexisting orders is believed to be valuable .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : model ] , we explain the formulation of our theoretical model . in sec.iii , the structure of @xmath0-wave sc and sdw orders in k - space",
    "is presented . in sec.[sec : sign_change ] , influences of the sign change of the gap function on the k - space structure of these orders are discussed , by comparing the results in the @xmath0-wave sc model and in the artificial model with one another . in sec.[sec : curvature ] , effects of the fs curvature on k - space structure of these orders and its consequences in the field dependence of a sdw staggered moment are discussed . in sec.[sec : summary ] , we present a summary and discussions of the results . throughout the present paper , expressions are written in unit of @xmath9 .",

    "the dispersion relation @xmath24 is that of the two - dimensional lattice system and is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the nearest and next - nearest neighbor hopping , respectively , and @xmath28 is the chemical potential , which is adjusted so that the fs nesting condition @xmath29 is precisely satisfied at the @xmath0-wave gap nodes on the line @xmath30 if @xmath31 ( see , however , below ) .",
    "our calculation is performed in the pauli limit , i.e. , the ppb effect is assumed to be so strong that the orbital pair - breaking effect is negligible . in accord with a neutron scattering experiment in the hflt phase of cecoin@xmath1@xcite",
    ", it is assumed that the sdw staggered moment is parallel to the c - axis , and that a single-@xmath23 sdw order is always realized @xcite .    to stress that the ppb - induced sdw ordering in the @xmath32-wave sc phase does not stem from a specific fermi surface but is a general phenomenon insensitive to the details of the fermi surface , the simplest fermi surface of the 2d tight - binding model will be used .",
    "further , a fflo spatial modulation of the sc order parameter , believed to be present in the high field phase of cecoin@xmath1 , will not be considered , and the sdw ordering in this work will be examined by assuming a spatially homogeneous sc order parameter because a sdw or antiferromagnetic ordering enhanced in higher fields is not believed to be peculiar to cecoin@xmath1 : as argued elsewhere @xcite , the tendency of the sdw ordering at the high field end of the sc phase is also seen in heavy fermion superconductors other than cecoin@xmath1 .    regarding the form of the pairing function @xmath4 ,",
    "the following two forms will be considered in the present paper : the first one is the usual @xmath0-wave one @xmath33 , which changes its sign in k - space such that @xmath34 with @xmath35 , and the second one is of an extended @xmath36-wave type @xmath37 , which does not change its sign in k - space .",
    "the implication of the use of the second functional form will be explained later in sec.[sec : sign_change ] .    in our calculation , it is assumed that the sdw order is incommensurate so that the modulation vector @xmath23 is equal to @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is an integer .",
    "note that , due to the four - fold rotational symmetry of @xmath24 and @xmath40 , the @xmath41-rotation of @xmath13 transforms @xmath42 with @xmath43 to @xmath42 with @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , it is justified to restrict ourselves to the case with @xmath44 . with this value of @xmath23 ,",
    "@xmath45 quasiparticle states are coupled with one another in @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and thus the action @xmath48 corresponding to the hamiltonian @xmath42 is written as a bilinear form of @xmath45-dimension @xmath49 where @xmath50 @xmath51 with @xmath52 ( @xmath53 is the fermion matsubara frequency ) , @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( @xmath56 is the @xmath57 identity matrix , and @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) is the pauli matrix ) .",
    "then , the free energy density @xmath60 can be calculated straightforwardly based on @xmath48 , as @xmath61 in the numerical calculation , we used @xmath62 , i.e. , @xmath63 in accord with the observed sdw modulation vector in cecoin@xmath1@xcite , and the values of @xmath3 and @xmath21 are obtained by numerically minimizing @xmath64 .",
    "structures of coexisting sc and sdw orders in k - space can be investigated in terms of the following correlation functions associated with the quasiparticle states with wave vector @xmath13 : @xmath65      \\nonumber \\\\      & = t\\sum_{\\omega_n } \\left ( [ \\hat{g}_k+\\hat{g}_{k - q}^*]_{3,1}-[\\hat{g}_{-k}+\\hat{g}_{-k+q}^*]_{4,2 } \\right ) ,      \\\\",

    "on the other hand , these correlation functions can be finite in the presence of the mean - field couplings ( see eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) ) , and the strength of the ordering in k - space can be measured by these correlation functions .",
    "in fact , the gap equations for sc and sdw orders are expressed in terms of @xmath68 and @xmath69 as @xmath70 @xmath71 equation ( [ eq : m ] ) shows that the sdw staggered moment @xmath21 is proportional to the sum of @xmath68 over k - space , indicating that @xmath68 measures the contribution of the quasiparticle states with wave vector @xmath13 to the sdw ordering . in our calculation",
    ", we verified that sdw correlation functions with higher harmonics ( e.g. @xmath72 ) are negligibly small , and thus , we focused only on @xmath68 to study sdw ordering in k - space . similarly , eq.([eq : delta ] ) shows that the sc order parameter @xmath3 is proportional to the weighted sum of @xmath69 with the gap function @xmath4 over k - space , indicating that @xmath69 measures the contribution of the quasiparticle states with wave vector @xmath13 to the cooper pairing .",

    "the used parameters are @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the pauli limiting field , and @xmath85 is the sc transition temperature at @xmath86 . , title=\"fig : \" ]    .",
    "[ fig : map ]    in this section , we present k - space structure of coexisting sc and sdw orders induced by the ppb effect .",
    "examples of k - space distributions of @xmath69 and @xmath68 are shown in fig.1 ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively , as colormaps .",
    "since the major contributions to sc and sdw orderings come from quasiparticle states in the vicinity of fs , the distributions of @xmath69 and @xmath68 are concentrated near fs in fig.[fig : map ] . in fig.[fig : map](a ) , the magnitude of @xmath69 is strongly suppressed in the narrow oval regions near the @xmath0-wave gap nodes ( @xmath87 ) . in these regions , the excitation energy in a pure sc phase with the zeeman energy @xmath88 become negative for @xmath89 in higher fields . since the negative excitation energy @xmath90 means that the cooper pairing including the quasiparticle with @xmath91 is unstable , @xmath69 is strongly suppressed in these regions .",
    "however , while @xmath69 in a pure sc phase is completely suppressed in these regions , @xmath69 is _ not completely _ suppressed in these regions when a sdw order is present ( see fig.[fig : fh](a ) and the discussions in sec.[sec : sign_change ] ) .    in fig.[fig :",
    "map](b ) , the major contributions to @xmath68 come from the narrow oval regions near @xmath92 .",
    "these regions contributing to the sdw ordering are determined under the following two conditions .",
    "the first one is that the fs nesting condition ( @xmath93 ) is satisfied better in these regions . in fig.[fig : map ] , in which the fs curvature is small , this condition is satisfied in a larger area of the fs in the first and third quadrants of the k - space . in relation to this ,",
    "the case with a large fs curvature will be discussed in sec.[sec : curvature ] later .",
    "the second one is that the sc order is suppressed by ppb in these regions : as the field is increased , the k - space regions contributing to the sdw ordering become broader , while the sc order is suppressed by ppb there .",
    "these conditions suggest that the sdw ordering is induced mainly by quasiparticle states in the k - space regions where the sc order is suppressed by ppb and the fs nesting condition is satisfied better . in nonzero fields where ppb is not negligible , however , these conditions does not play quantitatively main roles , and rather , as will be discussed in the next section , the @xmath94-dependent sign change of the @xmath0-wave gap function becomes an indispensable condition for stabilizing coexistence of sc and sdw orders in k - space .",
    "in this section , we explain the roles of the k - dependent sign change of the @xmath0-wave gap function ( @xmath33 ) in the ppb - induced coexistence of sc and sdw orders . for this purpose",
    ", we also analyzed a toy model in which the gap function with no sign change in k - space ( @xmath95 ) is assumed .",
    "this form of @xmath4 is nonanalytic in @xmath13 and might be artificial as a theoretical expression of a gap function of an existing real material . on the other hand , this form qualitatively describes an extended @xmath36-wave pairing case , and , by comparing the results from this @xmath4-form with those from the @xmath0-wave pairing form , roles of the amplitude and phase components of @xmath4 can be separated from each other to examine the essential roles of the sign change of @xmath4 around a gap node in k - space for the sdw ordering . in relation to this , note that the sc quasiparticle excitation energy @xmath96 is insensitive to the sign of @xmath4 so that @xmath96 in the artificial pairing - model mentioned above is identical to that in the usual @xmath0-wave case ( see eq.([eq : ek ] ) ) .",
    "consequently , the k - space region where the sc order is suppressed by ppb ( @xmath90 ) in the artificial model becomes completely the same as that in the @xmath0-wave case .",
    "as is seen below , the sdw ordering is not sensitive much to the @xmath13-dependence of @xmath96 .",

    ", we used the common parameter values regarding the electronic details in these models . in spite of this",
    ", a large difference is found in the field dependences of @xmath21 between these models . in fig.[fig : opvsh](a ) , the sdw ordering is not realized in the high - field normal ( non sc ) state , and the coexistence phase of sc and sdw orders is induced by ppb in the high - field region of the sc phase . in fig.[fig : opvsh](b ) , on the other hand , the sdw ordering is strongly suppressed in the sc phase compared to in the high - field normal phase , which indicates a clear competition between sc and sdw orders in the artificial model .",
    "this difference implies that the sign change of the gap function , which is present in the @xmath0-wave sc model and not in the artificial model , is essential to the realization of the ppb - induced sdw ordering only in a sc phase .    in both figures of fig.2 ,",
    "the appearance of the nonvanishing @xmath21 with increasing @xmath98 is continuous .",
    "this second order transition to the sdw ordered phase might be seen as a kink of the field dependence of @xmath3 . since the sc order is already present at this second order transition field where @xmath3 is large , however , effects of @xmath21 on @xmath3 are much smaller contributions to the free energy compared with those of @xmath3 on @xmath21 at least for the parameter values used in obtaining fig.2 .",

    "these results imply that sc and sdw orders are enhanced consistently with each other not only in real space but also in k - space in the @xmath0-wave sc model . in fig.[fig : fh](b ) , on the other hand , @xmath68 is maximal at the gap node , and is strongly suppressed in the region away from the gap node where @xmath69 is finite . furthermore , @xmath69 near the gap node is completely suppressed even in the presence of a sdw order .",
    "these results suggest that , contrary to the @xmath0-wave sc model , sc and sdw orders are competitive in k - space in the artificial model .",
    "the difference in the field dependences of @xmath21 between these models can be understood in the light of the difference in the k - space structure of sc and sdw orders between these models . in the @xmath0-wave sc model with a strong ppb effect , sc and",

    "even if there is no sdw ordering in a normal phase , a sdw order is induced in higher fields by the presence of a sc order . in the artificial model , on the other hand , sc and sdw orders are competitive in k - space",
    "; therefore , a phase with only one kind of orders tends to be more stable than a phase where both sc and sdw orders are present and coexist in k - space . as a result , the sdw ordering in a sc phase is strongly suppressed in contrast to that in a normal phase . as discussed above ,",
    "the difference between these models is solely originated from the presence or absence of the k - space sign change of the gap function .",
    "consequently , these results indicate that the k - space sign change of the gap function @xmath103 is the main origin of the mutual enhancement of @xmath0-wave sc and sdw orders in k - space and is necessary to realization of the sdw ordering appearing only in a sc phase .",

    "the overlap of sc and sdw orders in k - space become significantly small , as shown in fig.[fig : t2fs](a ) .",
    "this difference in the k - space structure of the sc and sdw orders due to a fs curvature affects the field dependence of the sdw ordering .",
    "the field dependence of @xmath21 in the case of the small fs curvature ( @xmath79 ) is shown in fig.[fig : opvsh](a ) , indicating that @xmath21 is maximal at @xmath8 , at which the ppb effect is the most effective . in this case , the k - space regions contributing to the sdw ordering become wider than the k - space regions in which the sc order is suppressed by ppb , leading to the monotonous increase of @xmath21 with the field in the sc phase . in the case of the large fs curvature ( @xmath130 ) , on the other hand",
    ", the field dependence of @xmath21 is plotted in fig.[fig : t2fs](b ) , showing that @xmath21 is maximal not at @xmath8 , but at the field _ slightly below _",
    "@xmath8 . because the overlap of sc and sdw orders in k - space becomes significantly small at a high field , the sdw ordering due to the mutual enhancement of these orders in k - space is destabilized in high fields .",
    "this results in the steep decrease of @xmath21 in high fields and thus the peak of @xmath21 at the field slightly below @xmath8 .",
    "in this paper , we have theoretically analyzed k - space structures of coexisting @xmath0-wave sc and sdw orders induced by ppb , and discussed the details of the mechanism of the ppb - induced sdw ordering .",
    "it has been shown that the sc order is suppressed in the k - space regions near the gap nodes , where the excitation energy @xmath96 in a pure sc phase is negative for @xmath89 due to the zeeman energy , and that the major contributions to the sdw ordering come from the k - space regions , where the sc order is suppressed by ppb , and the nesting condition of fs ( @xmath135 ) is satisfied ( fig.[fig : map ] ) .",
    "these results reflect the contributions of quasiparticle pockets@xcite , in which @xmath136 , because sdw ordering is mainly induced by quasiparticle states near the quasiparticle pockets connected by the nesting vector @xmath23 .",
    "however , it has been shown that the sign change of the gap function in k - space ( @xmath103 ) is more essential to the realization of the ppb - induced sdw ordering only in a sc phase .",
    "figure [ fig : opvsh ] shows that the coexistence of sc and sdw orders is stabilized in the high - field region of a @xmath0-wave sc phase with the k - space sign change of the gap function @xmath4 , while these orders are always competitive in the artificial model in which there is no sign change of @xmath4 in k - space . in relation to this , it has also been shown in ref . that a @xmath137-wave sc order , which does not satisfy @xmath103 with @xmath138 , is always competitive to a sdw order with the modulation vector @xmath23 .",
    "this fact also indicates that the k - space sign change of the gap function ( @xmath103 ) is a crucial factor for the ppb - induced coexistence of sc and sdw orders .",
    "the importance of the k - space sign change of the gap function can be explained based on the k - space structure of sc and sdw orders .",
    "it has been shown that , in the @xmath0-wave sc model , sc and sdw orders are enhanced with each other even in k - space , while , in the artificial model , these orders are competitive in k - space ( fig.[fig : fh ] ) .",
    "this result indicates that this mutual enhancement of @xmath0-wave sc and sdw orders originates from the sign change of @xmath4 and stabilizes the overlapped structure of these orders in k - space . as a result , the ppb - induced coexistent phase of sc and sdw orders is largely stabilized by this mutual enhancement .",
    "we stress that this mutual enhancement of sc and sdw orders in k - space resulting from the sign change of the gap function is the dominant mechanism for the ppb - induced sdw ordering .    in the case of a large fs curvature ,",
    "the hotspot for the nesting becomes smaller than the k - space region where a sc order is suppressed by ppb as the field is increased , leading to a decrease of the overlap of these orders in k - space ( fig.[fig : t2fs](a ) ) and a suppression of sdw ordering in the high - field region of the sc phase . as a result , the field dependence of a sdw moment @xmath139 has a peak at a field slightly below @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : t2fs](b ) ) .",
    "a peak of sdw ordering at a field slightly below @xmath8 has also been predicted in the case of a moderate strength of ppb with a second order sc transition at a high fields@xcite and in the case of a strong - coupling sc phase@xcite . however , the peak of sdw ordering in these cases results from the large decrease of a sc order parameter @xmath3 in higher fields , and the peak of @xmath139 in the case of a large fs curvature , where @xmath3 is almost independent of the field ( see fig.[fig : t2fs](b ) ) , is caused by the different mechanism from them .",
    "that is , the k - space structure of coexisting sc and sdw orders affects the ppb - induced sdw ordering in the present case .",
    "finally , we note that , as discussed in refs . , the enhancement of sdw ordering at a field below @xmath8 should be ultimately related to the field - induced antiferromagnetic quantum critical phenomena near @xmath8 observed in several heavy fermion superconductors with a strong ppb effect , such as cecoin@xmath1@xcite , cerhin@xmath1@xcite , ce@xmath140pdin@xmath141@xcite , and nppd@xmath1al@xmath140@xcite .",
