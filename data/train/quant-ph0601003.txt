    ".8 cm the solution of the spheroidal wave equation is a very old subject , but it still an important theme in the existing literature .",
    "the importance of this equation arises in many areas of physics .",
    "for instance , it plays an important role in the study of light scattering in optics [ 1 - 3 ] , nuclear modeling [ 4 ] , signal processing and communication theory [ 5 ] , electromagnetic modeling [ 6 ] , and in finding the electromagnetic induction ( emi ) response of canonical objects at magnetoquasistatic frequencies [ 7 ] .",
    "applications utilizing complex @xmath1 include for example , light scattering from spheroidal particles , and spheroidal antennas enveloped in a plasma medium .",
    "attempts to find rapid , and accurate eigenvalues @xmath0 of the angular spheroidal wave equation for large size parameter @xmath4 ( assumed real ) have been ongoing .",
    "flammer summarizes the work ( up to 1957 [ 8 ] ) , and documents the asymptotic expansions for @xmath0 of the angular spheroidal wave equation . since that time",
    ", serious attempts for this case were made by many authors .",
    "slepian [ 9 ] , and streifer [ 10 ] derived uniform asymptotic expansions for the spheroidal functions and their eigenvalues , which were further developed by des cloiseaux , and mehta [ 11 ] , and dunster [ 12 ] .",
    "other asymptotic results based on wkb methods have been obtained by sink , and eu [ 13 ] .",
    "recently , asymptotic expansions of @xmath0 for large @xmath5 , and @xmath1 have been proposed by guimares [ 14 ] , de moraes and guimares [ 15 ] , and the work of do - nhat [ 16 , 17 ] summarizes and provides more details of flammer s expansions for @xmath0 .    nevertheless , because of the complexity of the angular spheroidal wave equation with arbitrary complex size parameter @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , evaluation of @xmath0 in this regime has been much less studied .    very recently , barrowes et al .",
    "[ 18 ] compute the asymptotic expansions of @xmath0 with arbitrary complex size parameter @xmath1 in the asymptotic regime of large @xmath9 with @xmath5 , and @xmath3 fixed . on the other hand",
    ", few packages have been developed for the computation of the angular spheroidal eigenvalues @xmath0 with arbitrary complex size parameter @xmath10 .",
    "thompson [ 19 ] , li et al .",
    "[ 20 , 21 ] , and falloon et al .",
    "[ 22 ] are of the most recent ones .    those attempts to obtain the eigenvalues @xmath0 with arbitrary complex size parameter @xmath10 are rely heavily on power series expansions , and complicated recurrence relations .",
    "accurate results in those works are obtainable at the expense of extensive mathematical , and numerical manipulations , thus obscuring the physical analysis of the corresponding system .",
    "the present work applies the asymptotic iteration method ( aim ) [ 23 , 24 ] , for the computation of the angular spheroidal eigenvalues @xmath0 with arbitrary complex size parameter @xmath10 .",
    "this method was applied by barakat et al . [ 25 ] to compute the angular spheroidal eigenvalues @xmath0 with real @xmath4 , and for the eigenenergies of the anharmonic oscillator potential [ 26 ] .",
    "the implementation of this method was straightforward , and the results were sufficiently accurate for practical purposes .",
    "most importantly , the numerical computation of the angular spheroidal eigenvalues using this method was quite simple , fast , and the eigenvalues were satisfying a simple ordering relation .",
    "therefore , one can unambiguously select the correct starting eigenvalue .",
    "furthermore , aim was quite flexible in the sense that , it is applicable to any parameter value involved like @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath1 . it also handles @xmath0 with large @xmath2 , and @xmath1 which poses many numerical instabilities to some of the previously mentioned methods . therefore , the main motivation of the present work is to overcome the shortcomings of those approaches , and to formulate an elegant algebraic approach to yield a fairly simple analytic formula which will give rapidly the eigenvalues with high accuracy .    in this spirit , this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 the asymptotic iteration method for the angular spheroidal wave equation is outlined .",
    "the analytical expressions for asymptotic iteration method are cast in such a way that allows the reader to use them without proceeding into their derivation . in sec .",
    "3 we present our numerical results compared with other works , and then we conclude and remark therein .",
    "the angular spheroidal wave equation , with which we shall be concerned , is @xmath11 + \\left [ ( \\lambda^{m}_{\\ell}(c))^2-c^2\\eta^2-\\frac{m^2}{(1-\\eta^2)}\\right ]   s_{\\ell , m}(c;\\eta)= 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the parameter @xmath1 , which is related to the ellipticity of the spheroidal coordinate surfaces , is allowed to be a complex variable in the present work .",
    "consequently , there is no need to make the usual distinction between the prolate , and oblate forms of the spheroidal wave equation , and the prolate form equation ( 1 ) is adopted for definiteness .",
    "the other parameters @xmath0 , and @xmath3 are separation constants .",
    "the second arises as a wave number for the polar angle of spheroidal coordinates and , as usual , is required to be a nonnegative integer ; @xmath12 is an integer enumerating the eigenvalues , and functions .",
    "the spheroidal wave functions @xmath13 are defined to be the solutions of equation ( 1 ) that are finite at the two end points @xmath14 of the range of the independent variable . these finiteness can be satisfied only for certain eigenvalues @xmath0 , which depend on the values of @xmath1 once a specific value of @xmath3 has been chosen .",
    "the simplest case is that of @xmath1 = 0 , for which the function @xmath13 reduces to the associated legendre function , and @xmath15 is its eigenvalues .    here , the integer @xmath2 labels successive eigenvalues for fixed @xmath3 . when @xmath16 we have the lowest eigenvalue , and the corresponding eigenfunction has no nodes in the interval @xmath17",
    "when @xmath18 we have the next eigenvalue , and the eigenfunction has one node inside ( -1 , 1 ) ; and so on .",
    "a similar situation holds for the general case @xmath19 .    in order to apply the aim for the general case @xmath20",
    ", we have to investigate the behavior of the solution near the singular points @xmath14 . substituting a power series expansion of the form @xmath21 into equation ( 1 )",
    ", we find that the regular solution has @xmath22 . without loss of generality",
    ", we can take @xmath23 since @xmath24 is a symmetry of the equation .",
    "therefore , we get an equation that is more tractable to the method if we factor out this behavior .",
    "accordingly , we set @xmath25 then the new function @xmath26 will satisfy a second - order homogenous linear differential equation of the form @xmath27 where @xmath28    both equations ( 1 ) , and ( 4 ) are invariant under the replacement @xmath29 . thus the functions @xmath13 , and @xmath26 must also be invariant , except possibly for an overall scale factor .",
    "the systematic procedure of the aim begins by rewriting equation ( 4 ) in the following form @xmath30 where @xmath31 and following the technique of aim [ 23 , 25 ] , that will lead to a general solution of equation ( 6 ) : @xmath32.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if for some @xmath33 , @xmath34 with @xmath35    for sufficiently large @xmath36 , we can now introduce the termination condition of the method , which in turn , yields the angular spheroidal eigenvalues @xmath0 @xmath37",
    "within the framework of the aim mentioned in the above section , the angular spheroidal eigenvalues @xmath0 are calculated by means of equation ( 11 ) . to obtain the eigenvalues @xmath0 , the iterations should be terminated by imposing a condition @xmath38= 0 as an approximation to equation ( 11 ) . on the other hand , for each iteration , the expression @xmath39 depends on two variables : @xmath0 , and @xmath40 .",
    "the calculated eigenvalues @xmath0 by means of this condition should , however , be independent of the choice of @xmath40 .",
    "nevertheless , the choice of @xmath40 is observed to be critical only to the speed of the convergence to the eigenvalues , as well as for the stability of the process . in this work",
    "it is observed that , the best starting value for @xmath40 is the value at which the effective potential of equation ( 1 ) takes its minimum value . for this purpose , it is necessary to perform the variable change @xmath41 , mapping the finite interval ( -1,1 ) into the infinite one @xmath42 , and then equation ( 1 ) can be rewritten as @xmath43 where the effective potential @xmath44 is @xmath45 sech^2(x)-c^{2}sech^4(x).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath44 is an even function , its minimum value occurs when @xmath46 , which in turn implies that @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , at the end of the iterations we put @xmath47 .    to test the rate of convergence of aim numerically , we calculate the angular spheroidal eigenvalue @xmath48 shown in figure 1 .",
    "we simply tried a set of iteration numbers @xmath49 , and the convergence of aim seems to take place smoothly when @xmath50 iterations .",
    "proceeding in the same way , the results of the aim for @xmath0 with different values of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath1 are reported in tables 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 .",
    "the results are shown in such a way that one can easily judge the accuracy of the method .",
    "the angular spheroidal eigenvalues @xmath0 were calculated by means of 45 iterations only .",
    "our calculated eigenvalues @xmath0 are all in excellent agreement with the available published data [ 8 , 18 , 20 , 22 ] over the full range of parameter values , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath1 .    a second , more stringent , test of the method",
    "is shown in table 3 , where we consider large real @xmath1 , in this case , in order to reproduce more accurate results , the angular spheroidal eigenvalues @xmath0 were calculated by means of 100 iterations . again the agreement is quite excellent with the available published data .",
    "it is worthwhile to emphasize that , the aim is very easy to implement for calculating the angular spheroidal eigenvalues @xmath0 , without having to worry about the ranges , and forms of @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , for purely real c , and purely imaginary c , the obtained eigenvalues are satisfying a very simple ordering relation .",
    "but , for complex arbitray c values , the eigenvalues are no longer real , since the spheroidal equation is not self - adjoint . in this case",
    "the ordering is determined by the absolute magnitude of @xmath51 .",
    "hence , one can unambiguously select the correct starting eigenvalue .",
    "this represents a significant advantage over the tridiagonal matrix method [ 22 ] in which , the eigenvalues are not ordered , and hence to choose the correct matrix eigenvalue , one must use an iterative process to move towards the starting value .    as a concluding remark",
    ", we would like to point out that , the accuracy of the results could be increased if the number of iterations are increased . + this work is supported by king saud university , college of science - research center projects no .",
