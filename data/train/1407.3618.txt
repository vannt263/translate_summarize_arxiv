    "one of the key open questions regarding the operation of a tokamak fusion reactor is how the energy and particle losses from the confined plasma will distribute on the different plasma facing components ( pfc ) , as it will determine their heat loads , sputtering levels , tritium retention and lifetime .",
    "this depends on the transport processes regulating the width of the scrape - off layer ( sol ) .",
    "in particular , the distribution of heat and particle fluxes between divertor and main chamber wall depends on the balance between parallel and perpendicular transport in the sol .",
    "after the leading role of diffusion had been called into question @xcite , the outward propagation of intermittent convective structures known as `` filaments '' or `` blobs '' has become widely accepted as the dominant mechanism for cross - field transport on the low - field side of tokamaks .",
    "plasma filaments have been modeled as poloidally localized , coherent structures of high pressure that extend along the magnetic field lines within a background plasma of lower pressure .",
    "curvature - driven instabilities ( interchange / ballooning ) compete with fluctuating parallel currents to give rise to a poloidal polarization @xcite .",
    "this polarization causes an @xmath1 drift which propels the filament in the perpendicular direction . during the last two decades",
    ", filaments have been the subject of intense experimental and theoretical study @xcite .",
    "they have been observed to cause cross - field convection to dominate the sol in many major tokamaks including asdex @xcite , jt-60u @xcite , alcator c - mod @xcite , diii - d @xcite , asdex upgrade @xcite and tcv @xcite .",
    "+ one of the best documented experimental features of filamentary transport in the sol of tokamaks is the l - mode `` high density transition '' ( hdt ) taking place after a certain density around @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the ratio between the plasma core line density , @xmath4 , and the greenwald density , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the plasma current and minor radius ) .",
    "after such density is surpassed in the main plasma , the density profile in the sol changes , flattening its gradient and giving rise to a `` shoulder '' .",
    "although this transition had already been reported in other machines @xcite , it was first linked to enhanced perpendicular convective transport ( which `` could be dominated by large - scale convection cells '' ) in alcator c - mod @xcite : for @xmath8 , the sol displayed two regions , with a steep gradient in the near sol , followed by a flat gradient towards the wall . after a detailed analysis of sol transport , labombard et al .",
    "@xcite conclude that in the first region parallel conduction dominates over perpendicular transport while the far sol is dominated by perpendicular convection .",
    "after @xmath2 is surpassed , the flat gradient region extends from the wall to the separatrix and convection dominates the whole sol . in tcv @xcite ,",
    "a similar change of the density profile is observed : at fgw  0.25 there are two distinct decay lengths , while at fgw  0.6 there is only one .",
    "the high density profile is in very good agreement with esel simulations , which describe the transport in the sol as the result of interchange turbulence leading to the ejection of filamentary structures @xcite . in diii - d @xcite and asdex",
    "upgrade ( aug ) @xcite , a `` shoulder '' appears in the density profile after the hdt . in diii - d ,",
    "the transition is found at @xmath9 , and leads to a clear decrease in the far sol gradient , although it does not affect the near sol .",
    "it is also explained as an increase in the ratio of perpendicular to parallel transport , @xmath10 , due to an enhanced convection . in aug , the hdt is found @xcite at some density between @xmath11 and @xmath12 , although the two slopes ca nt be distinguished clearly at lower densities .",
    "the transition is explained as an increase in filamentary transport . finally , a similar transition is observed in jt-60u @xcite at a slightly higher density ( @xmath13 ) . +",
    "this transition in sol transport has been proposed as one of the key elements in the density limit : indeed , in alcator c - mod the density limit disruption has been observed when the combination of radiative and convective losses exceeded the input power @xcite .",
    "this happened when the flat convective region of the sol reached the separatrix and filaments began forming in the confined region @xcite .",
    "+ besides , part of the literature reporting the hdt investigates the relation between midplane transport and divertor evolution : experiments carried out in asdex @xcite revealed that the divertor strike line was broadened when the divertor electron temperature dropped as a result of increased perpendicular losses .",
    "early work in aug @xcite suggested that the detachment of the divertor takes place around the same density at which the shoulder appears in the midplane .",
    "finally , the change of sol profiles in jt-60u is related to the divertor detachment @xcite ( in this case , associated to the onset of a marfe near the x - point ) .",
    "the drop in @xmath14 leads to an increase of the density e - folding length , @xmath15 , although in this case it is interpreted as a drop in @xmath16 , and not as an enhancement of convection .",
    "interestingly , the reported detachment of the jt-60u divertor takes place at a higher density fraction ( around @xmath17 ) than in other devices , due to its ( then ) open divertor configuration @xcite .",
    "this difference is also observed for the onset of the midplane density shoulder , suggesting a clear link between them .",
    "+ in all these cases , the increase of the far sol e - folding length appears to be caused by an increased perpendicular to parallel transport ratio , typically linked to an enhanced convection of filaments .",
    "one likely explanation for this is the increase of ion - electron collisions as the result of the increase of sol density and the associated reduction in temperature : in endler s model , the rise of the spitzer resistivity along the field lines causes the growth rate of the filament instability , to increase as @xmath18 as @xmath14 decreases @xcite .",
    "according to the mixing length estimate , this would mean an increase in the perpendicular convective transport . also , the results from simulations by garcia et al .",
    "@xcite , which are in agreement with experimental results from tcv @xcite , reveal that filaments propagating in the sheath connected regime have lower radial velocities than those disconnected from the sheath due to an increase in collisionality .",
    "early models @xcite only considered sheath connected filaments with a parallel structure based on the `` simple sol '' @xcite , where the filament circuit was closed through the wall and the main potential drop was at the sheath . however , successive refinements @xcite included alternative closure schemes which defined different scalings of filament properties such as size , amplitude and velocity .",
    "these closure schemes are determined by sol characteristics such as x - point fanning , finite @xmath19 , parallel advection of vorticity , resistivity or @xmath20 . in this context ,",
    "myra et al .",
    "@xcite developed a model where the midplane becomes disconnected from the divertor for large collisionalities . in their invariant",
    "scaling , this transition is determined by the effective collisionality parameter    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the connection length , @xmath23 the sound speed , @xmath24 the electron - ion collision frequency and @xmath25 the gyrofrequency of species @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 can be seen as the ratio between the parallel characteristic length and the ion - electron mean free path . according to the model , for @xmath28",
    ", the midplane is connected to the wall , but for @xmath29 filaments undergo a regime transition which strongly increases their radial convection .",
    "later work @xcite has generalized this single filament - effect to the transport of a turbulent sol .",
    "this mechanism has been invoked @xcite to explain the hdt in the alcator c - mod experiment @xcite and its relation to the density limit . according to this interpretation",
    ", convection becomes a feedbacked channel for energy loss : as density increases over a certain threshold @xmath30 is increased , enhancing convection and resulting in less energy transported in the parallel direction . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath14 would drop downstream , thus further increasing @xmath27 .",
    "this would explain the formation of the convective profile `` shoulder '' over a certain density threshold which moves closer to the separatrix as plasma density is increased and the divertor effects mentioned before @xcite : an increase of @xmath27 would lead to a change in the @xmath10 balance , a wider sol and , finally , to divertor detachment .",
    "+ although a general picture of filamentary transport and its relation to the transition in the sol density profile is well established , a more quantitative description is still needed in order to understand the links to the density limit and connect midplane and divertor detachment physics and eventually achieve predictive capabilities . in this sense , the hdt is the ideal testbed to benchmark filament models with the potential to predict the @xmath10 ratio into a wider range of plasma conditions , including h - mode operation .",
    "a good example of this is the degradation of the confinement observed at high density h - mode operation in aug @xcite , where a similar change in the structure of the sol is observed as density is increased , and filamentary transport might play a role as an energy loss mechanism leading to the h - l back transition and eventual disruption of the plasma . in this context ,",
    "the purpose of this work is twofold : on a first level , the hdt in aug is investigated with an improved set of diagnostics in order to determine with precision its density threshold and to measure the associated changes in the sol transport . on a second level , we use the measurements to test the validity of the mechanisms discussed above , and their effect ( or lack thereof ) on the rest of the sol . with this purpose ,",
    "we provide a comprehensive experimental coverage of the sol evolution across the transition in order to analyze simultaneously the changes in midplane perpendicular transport , turbulence characteristics , collisionality parameter @xmath27 and the effect on the divertor to obtain a consistent picture of all the related phenomena . + the paper is organized as follows : in section [ exp ] we describe the experimental setup used in aug , along with the diagnostics employed and the characteristics of the plasma discharges . next",
    ", the methodology for the analysis of turbulence is described in section [ anatech ] .",
    "experimental results are presented in section [ expres ] .",

    "[ fig : profiles_multi ] ) , but also the presence of a cold region in front of the wall may interrupt the filament circuit , thus forcing the end of the sheath connected regime regardless of the values of @xmath27 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : div ] , the beginning of the divertor detachment affects the @xmath161 $ ] region , which roughly corresponds to @xmath146 where the main changes for filaments take place . also , in fig .",
    "[ fig : resumen ] ( bottom ) , the evolution of the dod on the outer divertor displays a very similar evolution indicating that both the beginning of the detachment and the collisionality transition happen roughly at the same time .",
    "+      in this sense , the discovered relation between the filament transition and the detachment of the outer divertor is very relevant and raises an intriguing question about the direction of causality in the observed events : one possible mechanism is that the increase of @xmath184 and density in the sol leads to a rise in the global collisionality @xmath27 along field lines , disconnecting the filaments from the divertor and leading to an enhanced convective radial transport .",
    "this would spread the power loads arriving into the divertor and cause its detachment or at least speed up the transition from partial to complete detachment along the entire target creating an enhanced power loss channel .",
    "however , the process could also work in the opposite direction : the beginning of the divertor detachment , caused by reasons unrelated to filamentary transport in the sol , creates a low temperature region in front of the targets which would greatly increase collisionality and thus disconnect the filaments regardless of the @xmath27 values in the midplane .",
    "this effect would start close to the separatrix ( where the detachment starts ) and propagate then towards greater @xmath34 values . as a result",
    ", filaments in the midplane would transit to the collisional regime and increase the radial transport in the observed way .",
    "both possibilities seem realistic and it is not possible to determine the direction of causality with current data .",
    "so far , the discussion about the effect of detachment has been focused on the outer divertor .",
    "since it has the lowest @xmath22 to the midplane , and given the clear connection between its dod and the formation of the velocity shear it would be expected to have greater influence .",
    "however , the question remains whether the key factor in the filament behavior is the beginning of the detachment of the outer divertor or the achievement of the total detachment in the inner one , since both happen roughly at the same times .",
    "+ another midplane effect of divertor detachment could be the emergence of the shear layer after the transition .",
    "a possible explanation for this would be , again , the electrical disconnection from the divertor : for low densities , the attached condition creates a @xmath197 which , due to the sheath potential drop , leads to a @xmath198 in front of the target plates . in this low density condition ,",
    "parallel gradients are very low and @xmath199 at the midplane is strongly influenced by the divertor temperature @xcite .",
    "therefore , an @xmath1 drift appears in the ion diamagnetic direction , as observed experimentally . over @xmath139",
    ", the high recycling regime causes @xmath14 to drop to a few ev for @xmath200 . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath199 in front of the target is reduced and , more importantly , the @xmath199 at the midplane is disconnected from the divertor . that radial range corresponds to the region where inversion of @xmath111 is observed . in good agreement with that ,",
    "@xmath82 profiles in the x - point are flattened after the transition . instead ,",
    "for @xmath201 the divertor is still not detached , @xmath14 remains relatively unaffected at the divertor and @xmath111 does nt change sign in the midplane .",
    "the first conclusion of this work is that the high density transition in aug displays the same behavior as reported from other machines in the reviewed literature : sol density and @xmath202 profiles broaden at densities above a threshold value of @xmath203 m@xmath67 , corresponding to @xmath115 .",
    "this change is observed with several diagnostics : the broadening of @xmath50 profiles is measured with lib and langmuir probes in the midplane and x - point reciprocators , while the broadening of the @xmath61 profile is measured by the ir camera on the mem probe head .",
    "the agreement between the different diagnostics is remarkable . in particular , lib data show how the structure of density profiles transits from a dual shape with a steep gradient close to the separatrix to a single region one , in which the whole sol shows the gradient observed in the far sol at lower densities .",
    "+ however , due to the combined use of sol diagnostics , a number of additional findings can be reported : in the first place , clear evidence has been provided that such variations in the profiles are accompanied by changes in the structure of filaments in the outer midplane . as the density surpasses the transition threshold ,",
    "filaments become larger and denser , increase their radial propagation speed and their detection frequency is reduced .",
    "this transition coincides with an increase in radial transport .",
    "this was measured both on the changes of @xmath15 and @xmath164 , which rise respectively by a factor of 5 and 3 , and on the average filamentary transport @xmath184 measured by the multipin probe head of the mem , which is increased by more than an order of magnitude leading to effective particle fluxes up to @xmath190 m@xmath186s@xmath187 .",
    "finally , all these changes coincide with the detachment of the outer divertor , as indicated by the degree of detachment and radial ion saturation profiles measured by the flushed mounted langmuir probe arrays on the targets .",
    "the outer divertor is the one with the shortest connection length to the midplane and the last to detach .",
    "therefore , it can be expected to be the main electrical interface between filaments and the solid wall .",
    "probably as a result of this , the poloidal rotation of filaments changes from the ion to the electron diamagnetic drift direction . + in order to explain the underlying physical mechanism , the validity of some models proposed in the literature has been investigated @xcite . according to these models",
    ", these changes would be the result of a transition in the filament regime , governed by collisionality along the filament , @xmath27 .",
    "an estimation of the values of @xmath27 showed it increases with density , @xmath58 , and crosses the critical @xmath193 value when @xmath203 m@xmath67 is reached .",
    "this result is consistent with the model proposed by myra et al .",
    "@xcite . however , these values only correspond to estimations on the midplane and must thus be taken with caution . a more meaningful calculation of @xmath27 would require to take into account the variations of @xmath50 , @xmath85 and @xmath14 along the whole field line ( including the divertor ) as well as the effect of neutrals and detachment .",
    "such quantitative calculations are considered beyond the scope of this work and left for future studies .",
    "nevertheless , given the qualitative agreement between the experimental results and the proposed models , an increase in convective transport can be considered as the mechanism governing the transition .",
    "the direction of causality between midplane profiles and divertor detachment ( i.e. , whether increased filamentary transport triggers the detachment or increased resistivity due to divertor detachment triggers the filament transition ) will be addressed in future work .",
    "+ summarizing this work , a consistent picture is provided in which many experimental findings are brought together under a coherent description linking filament models , midplane perpendicular / parallel transport balance and divertor detachment .",
    "these findings may turn out of great practical importance for the design and operation of next generation tokamaks : since these devices will operate at high densities and with detached divertors , transport in the sol can be expected to be dominated by filaments in the high density regime described in this work . therefore , the extrapolation of sol transport based on experimental observations conducted in present tokamaks with attached divertors and low collisionalities may be seriously underestimating the future particle and heat fluxes onto the main chamber wall . in this sense",
    ", it is particularly important to determine whether the key parameter governing the transition is the @xmath27 parameter at the main chamber or at the detached divertors , since nominal regimes in iter will feature partially detached divertors but still a very hot sol in the midplane ( with a relatively low @xmath27 ) .",
    "these regimes ca nt be achieved simultaneously in present day machines , excluding the possibility of direct extrapolation .",
    "therefore , iter operation will require a better understanding of the whole process , including a working conceptual model with some degree of predictive capability .",
    "the authors would like to thank s. potzel for the useful discussions .",
    "this work was supported by euratom and carried out within the framework of the european fusion development agreement .",
    "the views and opinions expressed herein do not necessarily reflect those of the european commission .",
    "blob velocity and size calculations based on conventional blob analysis techniques using the correlation between pins yielded non - physical results , including irrealistically large velocities ( and sizes ) . considering the initial results ,",
    "featuring filaments with perpendicular sizes in the range of several centimeters , an obvious source of error was the fact that filaments are typically larger than the distance between pins ( in the range of a few mm ) .",
    "therefore , some model of the simultaneous interaction of the blob with the whole pin array is required in order to correctly interpret probe data .",
    "such a simple model was then introduced , based on the following assumptions :    * the density distribution of the blob can be roughly approximated as an ellipse . *",
    "the size of the blob is larger than the projection of the distance between the pins on the axis perpendicular to the propagation . *",
    "the blob is symmetric with respect to axis parallel to the direction of propagation .",
    "if these assumptions hold , the points of the blob in which the maximum level of signal are detected by each probe will be roughly distributed along a straight line .",
    "this can be seen in the cartoon in figure [ fig_ap]a : as the blob propagates over the pins , the detection ( maximum in the @xmath31 signal happens at different times but always along the same dashed blue line traveling with it . in this case",
    ", the blob can be modeled as a front propagating at a velocity @xmath204 with an angle @xmath26 with respect to the binormal direction .",
    "both @xmath204 and @xmath26 can be calculated from the cross - correlation time between pins 1 and 2 , @xmath205 , and 1 and 3,@xmath206 .",
    "indeed , combining the geometric information of figure [ fig_ap]b ,         pins in fig [ fig : diag ] .",
    "@xmath210 and @xmath211 stand for radial and binormal directions .",
    "the blob measures 20 mm in the direction parallel to @xmath204 and the distance between pins is scaled accordingly .",
    "the relative trajectories of the pins are represented as dashed black lines .",
    "as an example , the signal measured by pin 2 , @xmath212 is represented over the trajectory .",
    "( b ) geometric description of the passage over the pins : @xmath213 and @xmath214 stand for the radial and binormal separation of the pins , @xmath204 is the perpendicular propagation velocity of the front / blob and @xmath205 , @xmath206 are the correlation delays between pin 1 and pins 2 and 3 . _",
    "_ ]    note that the purpose of this model is not to provide a precise description of the blob structure , but to find some working hypothesis which allow to get a correct qualitative measure of the blob propagation : the first assumption is commonplace in filament theory , and is in good agreement with general blob observations @xcite and also with gemr simulations of aug sol turbulence @xcite .",
    "the second assumption is introduced a posteriori as a result of the initial results of the conventional analysis . in any case , the results of this model are in good agreement with it : as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , the minimum size of the blob is around @xmath215 , with most blobs being substantially larger than that . as a reference ,",
    "the blob represented in the cartoon in figure [ fig_ap]a has a size of @xmath216 mm .",
    "finally , the third assumption comes from the general notion of the blob being propelled by the @xmath1 force caused by the dipole formed by the emergence of curvature drifts on the density fluctuation @xcite ( so in principle the axis of the roughly symmetric dipole should be perpendicular to @xmath204 ) .",
    "notice that no assumption is made on the size of the blob on the direction perpendicular to @xmath204 .",
    "the reason for this is an intrinsic feature of langmuir probe measurements ( and not a result of this model ) : regardless of the blob shape and tilt , a single pin can only collect information about the evolution of the blob in the direction of its motion . only through a complex reconstruction involving many pins can the shape of the blob in the direction perpendicular to it be assessed . as a result ,",
    "not much can be said about the shape or orientation of the detected filaments : the could either be circular , tilted ellipses or structures elongated along the radial direction ( streamers ) .",
    "in any case , the results seem to be reasonable when compared to other aug diagnostics ( see , eg . , fig [ fig : resumen ] ) or , as discussed in section [ discussion ] , with normalized blob measurements from other machines .",
