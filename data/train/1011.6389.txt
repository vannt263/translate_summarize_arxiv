    "a geometrically frustrated fcc lattice is obtained when only the b@xmath1 ions are magnetic .",
    "a conventional picture of isotropic antiferromagnetic superexchange is insufficient for these materials . altering this picture are two important effects considered in our work .",
    "the first effect is spin - orbit coupling , which is relevant for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 transition metal ions that comprise the magnetic sites .",

    "one particularly important result is the local @xmath5-axis compression or expansion of the b@xmath1-o octahedra , which we refer to as a _ tetragonal distortion _ of these octahedra .",
    "while the octahedral crystal field favors the @xmath6 orbitals over the @xmath20 ones , the tetragonal distortion will split the @xmath6 levels . in the case of a local @xmath5-axis compression , the @xmath21 orbital",

    "all of these effects will generate the anisotropic interactions that form the focus of our models .",

    "we are particularly interested in the case of a local b@xmath1-o @xmath5-axis compression , where orbital degeneracy is absent .",
    "la@xmath0limoo@xmath2 is a candidate for such a material , while the otherwise isostructural sr@xmath0careo@xmath2 features instead a @xmath5-axis expansion of the octahedra .",
    "la@xmath0limoo@xmath2 shows no magnetic ordering down to 2 k from either heat capacity or neutron diffraction ; however , @xmath27sr measurements show evidence of short - range correlations developing below 20 k.@xcite the curie - weiss temperature is negative , @xmath28 k , indicating predominant antiferromagnetic superexchange .",
    "in contrast , sr@xmath0careo@xmath2 shows spin - freezing behavior below 14 k.@xcite    in the present work , we use the sp(@xmath8 ) generalization of heisenberg models to describe these systems.@xcite this generalization provides a unifying framework to study the effect of spin magnitude , from semiclassical ordering at `` large spin '' to possible spin liquid phases for `` small spin '' .    the ability to capture `` large - spin '' magnetic order may help to describe the higher - spin analogues of @xmath24 double perovskites . in particular , the `` spin-@xmath29 '' analogue of la@xmath0limoo@xmath2 is the isostructural la@xmath0liruo@xmath2",
    ", whose @xmath30 configuration occupies all three @xmath6 orbitals .",
    "since the effective magnetic moment is close to the spin-@xmath29-only moment , there is only slight renormalization due to spin - orbit coupling , and intra - orbital coulomb repulsion is the dominant effect in determining orbital occupancy .",

    "[ sec : model ] , we discuss the effects of monoclinic distortion and spin - orbit coupling .",
    "this leads us to consider two different models , the _ planar anisotropy _ and _ general anisotropy _ models , each taking the form of a pseudo - spin heisenberg model . in  [ sec : classicalresults ] , we solve for the classical spin ordering of both of these models . in  [ sec : meanfieldtreatment ] , we describe the sp(@xmath8 ) generalization of the heisenberg model and its mean - field treatment .",
    "results of this mean - field treatment are shown in  [",
    "sec : planaranisotropy ] for the planar anisotropy model , and in  [ sec : generalanisotropy ] for the general anisotropy model .",
    "an extension to finite temperature is discussed in  [ sec : finitetemperature ] . in  [ sec : discussion ] , we summarize our results and discuss extensions of this work .",
    "in modelling monoclinically distorted double perovskites with @xmath3 or @xmath4 magnetic ions , there are two important effects of the monoclinic distortion that should be considered in conjunction with spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the first effect of monoclinic distortion is local @xmath5-axis compression or expansion of the b@xmath1-o octahedra , which affects orbital occupation .",
    "the second is the change of orbital orientation due to the geometric distortion , which affects overlap integrals and the resultant interactions .",
    "we will derive our models by considering the effect of distortion and spin - orbit coupling on the interactions between @xmath6 orbitals .",
    "one motivation for our models comes from a spin-@xmath7 heisenberg model obtained via spin - dimer calculation for the isostructural monoclinically distorted double perovskites la@xmath0limoo@xmath2 and sr@xmath0careo@xmath2.@xcite in this method , the tetragonal compression ( or expansion ) of these materials was modelled by assuming occupation of only the @xmath21 orbitals ( or equal occupation of only the @xmath22 and @xmath23 orbitals ) .",
    "this method is also sensitive to the effect of the geometric changes resulting from the distortion .",
    "however , spin - orbit coupling was not considered , so that the assumed orbital occupation will be slightly incorrect .",
    "the result is an anisotropic @xmath15 heisenberg model , with estimates for the relative strengths of the couplings , seen in table [ tab : jparams ] .",
    "to understand the effects of the monoclinic distortion and spin - orbit coupling , we first look at the interactions between neighboring @xmath6 orbitals in the case of cubic symmetry , as have been considered in detail by chen _ et al_.@xcite to facilitate this , we show the six nearest - neighbor directions @xmath33 for the fcc lattice in figure [ fig : fcclattice ] . without distortion , the @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36-axes",
    "are simply the cartesian @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath5-axes .",
    "the strongest interaction is antiferromagnetic superexchange , involving sites and orbitals lying in the same plane .",
    "for instance , @xmath21 orbitals on neighboring sites along the @xmath31-@xmath32 plane will interact antiferromagnetically .",
    "ferromagnetic interactions between sites on a plane will couple orbitals lying on that plane to orbitals lying perpendicular to it.@xcite along the @xmath31-@xmath32 plane , @xmath21 orbitals interact ferromagnetically with neighboring @xmath23 and @xmath22 orbitals .",
    "quadrupole - quadrupole interactions also exist between all @xmath6 orbitals on neighboring sites , due to different orientations of the quadrupole moments of these orbitals .",
    "the first effect of monoclinic distortion is the local @xmath5-axis distortion of the @xmath37-o octahedra , a compression for la@xmath0limoo@xmath2 and an expansion for sr@xmath0careo@xmath2 .",
    "this splits the degeneracy of the three @xmath6 orbitals .",
    "the @xmath22 and @xmath23 orbitals will remain degenerate , but the @xmath21 orbital will have a lower energy for a compression and a higher energy for an expansion .",
    "consequently , the occupation of the @xmath21 orbital will be favored or disfavored compared to occupation of the other two orbitals .",
    "this is taken as a very important effect in the spin - dimer calculation to explain the relative anisotropies of the two materials.@xcite    the second important effect of the monoclinic distortion is a global @xmath36-axis elongation , and rotation of the b@xmath1-o octahedra , affecting the overlap of the occupied orbitals , which are now tilted out of plane .",
    "an example of this , in the case of la@xmath0liruo@xmath2 , is shown in figure [ fig : laliruo ] .",
    "the @xmath21 orbitals , for instance , are tilted out of the @xmath34-@xmath35 plane , and will have some interaction with @xmath21 orbitals on neighboring planes . in this fashion , many new exchange pathways will contribute at the nearest - neighbor level .",
    "these effects generate a significant amount of exchange anisotropy in the spin - dimer calculation.@xcite the relative coupling strengths estimated by spin - dimer calculation for la@xmath0limoo@xmath2 and sr@xmath0careo@xmath2 can be seen in table [ tab : jparams ] .",
    ".relative strengths of heisenberg couplings , given in figure [ fig : fcclattice ] , from the spin - dimer calculation of aharen _",
    "et al_.@xcite [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     interactions between @xmath31-@xmath32 planes in la@xmath0limoo@xmath2 are relatively weak , as expected from dominant in - plane @xmath21-@xmath21 antiferromagnetic interaction and @xmath36-axis elongation .",
    "we note that further in - plane anisotropy is significant , due to the strong effect of mo - o octahedra rotation upon @xmath21 orbital overlap . in sr@xmath0careo@xmath2 ,",
    "intra - plane interactions are still larger than inter - plane interactions , even though the superexchange between @xmath21 orbitals is not present .",
    "the only in - plane superexchange processes occur through tilted @xmath22 or @xmath23 orbitals",
    ". nevertheless , the inter - plane interactions are significantly stronger than in la@xmath0limoo@xmath2 .",
    "the length of the unit cell along the @xmath36 axis is significantly larger than along the @xmath34 or @xmath35 axes , which could explain the smaller inter - plane coupling compared to the intra - plane one . for both materials , however , the planar anisotropy of the couplings is clear , and effects of both geometrical distortion and orbital occupation are important .      beyond monoclinic distortion ,",
    "we now consider spin - orbit coupling , which can be important in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 magnetic ions commonly seen in the double perovskites .",
    "for instance , spin - orbit coupling in octahedrally coordinated mo@xmath38 is estimated to be on the order of 0.1 ev.@xcite the effect of spin - orbit coupling on the @xmath6 orbitals of octahedrally coordinated ions is a well - studied problem .",
    "when the octahedral crystal field splitting is significantly large compared to the spin - orbit coupling , we may project out the @xmath20 states . upon projection , the @xmath39 orbital angular momentum for the @xmath40 orbitals looks like a @xmath41 pseudo - angular momentum operator @xmath42 up to a sign change , where @xmath43 .",
    "this @xmath14 pseudo - orbital angular momentum combines with the @xmath44 angular momentum of the single electron to create states of effective total angular momentum @xmath18 and @xmath7 .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling @xmath45 breaks the degeneracy of these states , where the four @xmath18 states have an energy @xmath46 lower than the two @xmath19 ones .",
    "these @xmath18 states are written in terms of the @xmath6 ones as @xmath47 with a @xmath24 configuration , the occupancy of the @xmath21 orbital upon projection to these states is given by@xcite @xmath48 the occupation operators for the other @xmath6 orbitals are given by cyclic permutation of the @xmath49 indices , and the single - occupancy constraint @xmath50 is satisfied .",
    "the effect of projection onto this @xmath18 subspace , due to large spin - orbit coupling , has been considered by chen _",
    "_ for the cubic materials.@xcite the hamiltonian can be written in terms of the orbitally - resolved spin operators , such as @xmath51 . upon projecting to the @xmath17 states ,",
    "these orbitally - resolved spin operators contain terms both linear and cubic in @xmath52 .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian , containing terms of 4@xmath53 and 6@xmath53 order in @xmath52 , leads to interesting multipolar behavior.@xcite    when spin - orbit coupling is much larger than the local @xmath5-axis crystal field , the @xmath18 states provide the relevant starting point , rather than the @xmath6 orbitals .",
    "however , one can consider the general splitting of @xmath6 orbital degeneracy in the presence of both spin - orbit coupling and the local @xmath5-axis distortion .",
    "we can model each site with a local hamiltonian @xmath54   - \\lambda { \\ensuremath{\\mathbf{l}}}\\cdot{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{s}}}$ ] , where @xmath55 is the strength of the crystal field splitting due to local @xmath5-axis compression .",
    "the case for a local @xmath5-axis expansion has been considered by jackeli and khaliullin.@xcite we proceed in a similar manner , identifying the relevant low - energy eigenstates of @xmath56 .",
    "diagonalization of @xmath56 determines the lowest - energy kramers pair to be given by @xmath57 the energy difference between the ground and first excited doublets is given by @xmath58 , which goes to zero as @xmath59 , and approaches @xmath60 when @xmath61 .",
    "we consider the case where this separation is large enough to focus on the lowest - energy doublet .",
    "this will require the tetragonal crystal field to be significantly larger than the exchange coupling @xmath62 , regardless of the relative strength of spin - orbit coupling . by projecting out the higher - energy states",
    ", we obtain a pseudo - spin-1/2 model .    within this projection",
    ", we consider the form of the interactions in an otherwise cubic double perovskite , beginning with the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction .",
    "due to the fixed orbital occupation in ( [ eqn : lowedoublet ] ) , this interaction is constant and will not contribute to our models .",
    "the orbitally off - diagonal ferromagnetic interactions , of strength @xmath63 , generate pseudo - spin interactions that are both spatially and spin - anisotropic .",
    "for our models , we will focus on the antiferromagnetic interactions .",

    "we note that the introduction of spin - orbit coupling results in a reduction of the magnetic moment compared to the case of @xmath21 occupation when @xmath73 .",
    "the first , and simpler , of the two models considered in this paper is concerned primarily with the effects of the tetragonal crystal field splitting . without spin - orbit coupling , we see easily from ( [ eqn : generalantiferromagnetic ] ) that preferential @xmath21 orbital occupation leads to anisotropic interactions that are stronger on the @xmath31-@xmath32 planes . in this case",
    ", we have a true spin-@xmath7 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model .",
