    "in classical statistical mechanics , a particle is described in terms of a nonnegative phase space distribution @xmath0 this is the probability of the particle having position @xmath1 and momentum @xmath2 at the time @xmath3 .",

    "for instance , the wigner distribution obeys the same equation of motion ( [ eq : classtraj ] ) as a classical phase space distribution .",
    "bracken and melloy @xcite recently found that the probability of observing a free particle in a certain region of space may increase even though there is zero probability for the particle to have momenta pointing towards this region .",
    "they explained this effect in terms of negative probability .",
    "here we shall study another dynamical effect which defies explanation in terms of the classical model ( [ eq : posdist ] ) and ( [ eq : classtraj ] ) . to this end",

    "violation of ( [ eq : nonneg ] ) therefore can be interpreted in classical terms as due to negative kinetic energy given @xmath1 .",
    "it may seem surprising that a negative kinetic energy can be observed .",
    "indeed , the operator @xmath15 has only nonnegative eigenvalues , and the expectation of this operator therefore is always nonnegative .",
    "but this does not imply that also _ conditional _ kinetic energy must be nonnegative . indeed , in tunneling , it seems as if the particle traversing the tunneling region has negative kinetic energy , since the total energy is lower than the energy of the potential barrier .",

    ", one might instead abandon ( [ eq : classtraj ] ) @xcite .",
    "this amounts to abandoning the idea that a point in phase space moves with constant velocity .",
    "the analysis done here can be generalized to particles in arbitrary potentials .",
    "also in this case it can be shown that negative kinetic energy leads to nonclassical evolution of the position absolute value .",
