    "the problem of crystal lattice disorder effect upon the processes of inelastic and phase relaxation of electrons in metal systems continues to be topical .",
    "theory @xcite demonstrates that the electron - electron interaction increases with disordering and the behavior of temperature dependence of electron - electron relaxation time @xmath1 depends on system dimensionality .",
    "thus , for a two - dimensional system @xmath2 , not to @xmath3 , as it follows from the fermi - liquid theory for pure metals .",
    "electron relaxation time due to inelastic electron - phonon collisions , @xmath4 , in pure metals is characterized by the dependence @xmath5 which is also true for weak disorder @xcite with @xmath6 ( `` pure limit '' ) where @xmath7 is the thermal phonon wave vector and @xmath8 is the electron mean free path . in the case of strong disorder with @xmath9 ( `` dirty limit '' )",
    ", the temperature dependence of @xmath10 should take the form @xmath11 as reported in @xcite . the increase in exponent on @xmath12 and the unexpected dependence on @xmath8 ( the frequency of electron - phonon scattering decreases with @xmath8 )",
    "can be attributed to the reduction in the electron - phonon interaction on the crossover to a dirty limit .",
    "the processes of inelastic electron scattering by oscillating impurities that result in the dependence @xmath13 are considered in ref .  .",
    "according to ref .",
    "this contribution makes itself evident under electron scattering by transverse phonons at @xmath14 .",
    "however , as shown in ref .  , the contribution of this mechanism is cancelled out in dirty limit and is missing in the pure one @xcite .",
    "hence the pure - dirty limit transition must involve the change of the dependence @xmath5 to @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , for disordered metals both the behavior of temperature dependence of @xmath4 and the effect of electron mean free path on @xmath4 are currently central problems .    in disordered metals the interference of electron wave functions at low temperatures results in quantum corrections to conductivity that may be attributed to the effects of weak localization ( wl ) @xcite and electron - electron interaction ( eei ) @xcite .",
    "the values of these corrections are directly related to the characteristic electron relaxation times and electron - electron interaction constants .",
    "this permits the phase relaxation time of electron wave function , @xmath16 , ( in essence , the inelastic relaxation time ) and the spin relaxation time of electrons due to spin - orbit ( @xmath17 ) and spin - spin ( @xmath18 ) interaction to be determined from the analysis of the experimental temperature and magnetic field dependences of conductivity , @xmath19 .",
    "it was found @xcite that the temperature dependence of @xmath16 determined from the quantum corrections to magnetoconductivity of au films could be described by the relation @xmath20 at @xmath21  k , the latter being associated with the electron - phonon relaxation processes .",
    "more recently , the same result was obtained in refs .   .",
    "according to ref .  , the contribution of electron - phonon relaxation separated from @xmath22 for an au film of @xmath23  @xmath24 ( @xmath25 is sheet resistance ) could be described by the relation @xmath26 , where @xmath27  s@xmath28k@xmath29 .",
    "however , the overheating experiments at ultralow temperatures ( 0.031  k ) described in ref .   for au films of @xmath30  @xmath24 resulted in an expression @xmath31 , where @xmath32@xmath33 and @xmath34  s@xmath28k@xmath35 .",
    "a similar relation @xmath36",
    "s@xmath28 is consistent with the data on temperature dependence of @xmath16 obtained in ref .   for au films of @xmath37  @xmath24 in the temperature range 0.0510 k. thus , for au films @xmath38 and/or @xmath10 have a @xmath3 dependence in some cases and a @xmath39 dependence in other cases .",
    "the @xmath40 dependence was also found for nb films from the effect of electron overheating in the temperature range 1.510k @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 dependence was as a rule observed for pure films of other metals .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "a temperature dependence of the inelastic time was obtained for pure al films from weak localization . from this dependence the contribution of electron - phonon scattering was separated , which agreed with @xmath41 calculated from the real band structure of al for electron scattering by longitudinal phonons .",
    "a similar result was also obtained for al films later @xcite . for pure cu films",
    "the dependence @xmath5 for the time of electron - phonon energy relaxation at ultralow temperatures ( 10 - 300   mk ) was obtained from the effect of electron overheating @xcite .",
    "the effects of electron mean free path and film thickness on electron phase relaxation time in au , ag and mg films were studied in ref .  .",
    "the electron mean free path , @xmath8 , was varied by annealing of quench - condensed films by stages .",
    "the experiments did not reveal any dependence of @xmath16 on electron mean free path .",
    "the same result was obtained for the films of some other metals , for instance , sb @xcite and bi @xcite . however , for nb films the dependence upon the mean free path of the @xmath42-type was found in ref .  . in our opinion , the results given in refs .",
    "may be attributed to a `` pure limit '' .",
    "a contradictory situation appears in ref . :",
    "the @xmath43 dependence points to the `` dirty '' limit , though the exponent on t is much below 4 .",
    "this paper is concerned with the effect of disordering on characteristic electron relaxation times in thin au films ( @xmath44 ) estimated by analyzing the quantum corrections to conductivity .",
    "the disorder was enhanced by irradiating the films with 3.5 kev ar ions , resulting in radiation damage of the crystal lattice .",
    "variation in the fluence enabled us to prepare a series of samples of much the same thickness ( @xmath45  nm ) with the values of @xmath25 between 6 and 500  @xmath24 .",
    "this permitted the previous data on manifestation of quantum interference effects in au films @xcite to be complemented and new and , in some cases , unexpected features of disorder influence on phase and spin relaxation of electrons to be revealed .",
    "the au films with thickness @xmath46  10  nm were prepared by condensing a metal molecular beam at a rate 0.05  nm@xmath47s@xmath28 at pressure of residual gases @xmath48  pa .",
    "99.99 % purity gold was evaporated out of a mo boat onto a sapphire single - crystal substrate ( for measuring film conductivity ) and a nacl single - crystal cleft ( for tem study ) .",
    "both substrates were precoated with a sio sublayer ( @xmath46  15 nm thick ) to ensure identical structural and topological parameters of the deposited films . to enhance the structure disordering ,",
    "the films were bombarded in vacuum with argon ions of energy 0.5 - 3.5 kev .",
    "the ion fluences @xmath49 varied within @xmath50 and @xmath51  cm@xmath29 .",
    "with this irradiation dose the decrease in the film thickness was negligible ( 10 - 20 % with the highest dose ) , but with a large dose holes with the sizes of @xmath53 nm appeared in the film .",
    "the total surface fraction of the holes under the highest irradiation dose was @xmath54 .",
    "the electron microscopic results for the films are reported in ref .  .",
    "as the irradiation dose was increased , the film resistance became tens of times higher against its initial value .",
    "we suggest that the irradiation induced increase in the film resistance is substantially associated with radiation defects generated in the lattice . for the interference effects under consideration , which result from frequently occurring elastic processes of electron scattering , the nature of scatterers is of no importance . what counts is that the electron motion be of diffusion nature because of small electron mean free paths .",
    "the effects of wl and eei in the films studied manifested themselves in the dependences of resistance @xmath55 on perpendicular magnetic field @xmath56 ( varied up to 20 koe ) and temperature ( varied between 0.5 and 50 k ) .",
    "the resistance measurements were carried out by using a standard four - probe dc technique .",
    "the values of current ( 520 @xmath57a ) were chosen in such a way as to prevent , where possible , the influence of joule heating .",
    "the relative error of the resistance measurements was @xmath58 .",
    "the film area under measurement was 2 mm @xmath59 0.1 mm in size .",
    "the samples were places into a vacuum cryostat with a superconducting solenoid where the sapphire substrate was in a good thermal contact with a copper vessel filled with @xmath60he to produce temperatures below 1.5 k.    preliminary results on the problem discussed are reported in ref .   .",
    "our earlier data and the new experimental results of this study were computer - processed using an advanced program to fit experiment results and theoretical formulas .",
    "a very good description was obtained , which made conclusions more reliable and convincing .",
    "to analyze the temperature and magnetic field dependences of conductivity @xmath61 , well - known expressions for quantum corrections @xmath62 associated with wl and eei effects in two - dimensional systems @xcite have been used . for the films",
    "studied , the two - dimensional conditions of manifestation of quantum interference effects are fulfilled : @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the film thickness , @xmath65 = @xmath66 is the diffusion length of phase relaxation , @xmath67 is the thermal coherence length in a normal metal , and @xmath68 is the electron diffusion coefficient .",
    "the contribution of wl and eei to the temperature dependence of conductivity in a zero magnetic field is of the form :    @xmath69 + \\lambda_{t}^{d}\\ln \\frac{kt\\tau}{\\hbar } \\right\\ } \\label{one}\\ ] ]    where @xmath70 is the elastic electron relaxation time , @xmath71 ; @xmath72 , @xmath73 is the phase relaxation time due to inelastic scattering , @xmath74 is the interaction constant in the diffusive channel .",

    "the variation of conductivity in an arbitrary temperature range from @xmath80 to @xmath81 due to wl and eei effects is    @xmath82 + \\lambda_{t}^{d } \\ln \\frac { t_{2 } } { t_{1 } }   \\right\\ } \\label{two}\\ ] ]    below we use @xmath83 , which is true for small corrections",
    ".    the variation of conductivity in a perpendicular magnetic field associated with the wl effect in two - dimensional system can be given by the expression :    @xmath84    where @xmath85 , @xmath86 is digamma function . for the films",
    "studied , the contribution of eei to magnetoresistance ( mr ) is negligible , so we do not cite corresponding expressions .",
    "as an example , fig .  [ fig.1 ] shows the experimental @xmath87 dependences obtained at different temperatures(up to 50 k ) for one of the samples .",
    "it can be seen that the mr is positive which is the case of a strong spin - orbit interaction ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "however , the curves @xmath87 are nonmonotonic : for nonirradiated samples a well - defined maximum can be seen .",
    "the shape of @xmath89 curves reflects , according to eq .",
    "( [ three ] ) , a competition of inelastic and spin - orbit electron scattering contributions .    using computer fitting procedure according to eq .",
    "( [ three ] ) the characteristic values @xmath90 and @xmath91 can be found from the experimental data . in order to determine @xmath16 and @xmath17 ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath92 has been used , where fermy velocity @xmath93 is found from the free - electron model and @xmath8 from the relation @xmath94",
    "@xmath95@xmath96 for au @xcite ( where @xmath97 is the film resistivity , calculated , taking into account the electron - microscopic data for the topological structure of the films ) .",
    "the experimental magnetoresistive data are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] by dots , while solid curves represent the calculated @xmath98 dependences using eq .",
    "( [ three ] ) with @xmath90 and @xmath91 as fit parameters . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] the fitting accuracy was high enough .",
    "[ fig.2 ] shows a typical @xmath99 dependence .",
    "the @xmath99 dependences characterize the temperature variation of @xmath16 since d may be assumed to be temperature - independent .",
    "it can be seen that the character of this dependence changes with decreasing temperature .",
    "within the temperature range 1050 k , the @xmath100 dependence is revealed , where @xmath101 , in the range 310 k , @xmath102 dependence has been observed for high - resistive samples and at lower temperatures ( @xmath103  k ) @xmath90 goes to some constant value .",
    "the saturation of @xmath22 dependence at very low temperatures may be attributed to several factors .",
    "one of them is the influence of electron overheating caused by the measuring current .",
    "we however believe , that this factor is hardly probable since the used measuring currents were quite small . besides",
    ", electron overheating does not lead to saturation and does not change the slope of the dependence @xmath22 though the @xmath22 values differ from the true ones .",
    "it is more likely that saturation of @xmath22 is due to spin electron scattering . in this case",
    "the saturation occures when spin scattering by magnetic impurities at very low temperatures starts predominating over the processes of electron - electron and electron - phonon scattering , and the characteristic time of spin scattering is temperature - independent .    a new explanation proposed in ref",
    ".   attributes the low - temperature saturation of @xmath22 dependences in one - dimensional ( 1d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems to the influence of zero - point fluctuations of phase coherent electrons , which leads to intrinsic decoherence of electrons .",
    "this model accounts not only for its authors results taken on narrow ( quasi-1d ) au films , but it also explains the @xmath22 saturation in 1d and 2d metallic and semiconducting samples , observed by other reseachers . besides , the characteristic saturation time @xmath104 , calculated within the model of fluctuation decoherence , agrees well with the experiment .",
    "as the resistance of the samples increases ( and hence the diffusion coefficient of the electrons decreases ) , the time @xmath104 becomes shorter .",
    "this regularity is observed , but only for high - ohmic samples with @xmath105 , and the changes are considerably smaller than in ref .  . in our samples",
    "the saturation occures in comparatively low - ohmic samples too .",
    "this implies that the model used in ref .   can not be the only explanation of saturation of @xmath22 dependence at low temperatures .    above 4 k , where the factors responsible for the low temperature saturation of the dependence @xmath22 turn out to be insignificant , this dependence can be approximated by    @xmath106    in which the electron - electron relaxation rate is numerically determined by the expression in ref .  :",
    "@xmath107    thus , at temperatures below 2 k , the character of temperature dependence of @xmath22 depends on the times @xmath104 and @xmath18 . at higher temperatures",
    "the shape of the curve @xmath22 is first dictated by the predominating electron - electron ( ee ) relaxation processes , and for the temperatures @xmath108  k - by the processes of electron - phonon ( ep ) relaxation .",
    "to separate the contributions of the e - e and e - p relaxation to @xmath16 , we used the following procedure .",

    "( [ six a ] ) , because the error is about 50 % in this case .",
    "our experimental dependences were plotted in the coordinates @xmath114 vs. @xmath12 . for high - ohmic samples ( @xmath115 )",

    "( [ five ] ) .",
    "it is also found in earlier studies ref . that the ratio of calculated and experimental @xmath1-values for au films is close to 1 ( @xmath116 1.051.2 ) .",
    "this permits us to take @xmath1 equal to the value , given by eq .",
    "( [ five ] ) .",
    "then , @xmath113 , and @xmath79 can be found with good accuracy ( the error is below 15% ) .    for low - ohmic samples @xmath117",
    "the electron - electron relaxation is not essential since the inequality @xmath118 holds in the whole temperature range down to @xmath119  k. spin - spin scattering or electron decoherence is observed below this temperature .",
    "for these samples no horizontal part is seen in the @xmath114 vs. @xmath12 dependences and at @xmath120 k the @xmath22 dependence actually characterizes electron - phonon relaxation . for low - ohmic samples",
    "it can be described by the @xmath40 dependence .",
    "we have found that at enhancing disorder and growing @xmath25 the @xmath16 behavior is different in different temperature ranges : @xmath16 increases in the region of predominating electron - phonon scattering and goes down in the region , where the e - e scattering makes itself evident .",
    "[ fig.3 ] ) .",
    "the figure is a vivid demonstration of the general statement : as disorder increases , the electron - phonon interaction grows weaker , while electron - electron interaction is enhanced .",
    "the reliability of obtained @xmath16 and @xmath17 values can be illustrated while comparing the temperature - resistance dependence calculated using @xmath22 and @xmath17 derived from magnetoresistance with the experimental @xmath121 data .",

    "[ fig.4 ] ) a horizontal part and then a weak growth of resistance as the temperature goes down .",
    "this behavior of the resistance can be explained well in terms of the wl and eei effects .",
    "for the strong spin - orbit interaction ( @xmath88 and @xmath123 ) eq .",

    ", the coefficient @xmath131 has to be less than the theoretical value .",
    "beside this , @xmath132-time decrease of @xmath79 in the expression @xmath133 is typical of percolation systems @xcite .",
    "this effect has not been found in the films studied .    with the separated contribution of the e - e relaxation to @xmath16 it turns out , that for high - resistance samples ( @xmath134  @xmath24 )",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath4 can be described by the function @xmath135 where @xmath79 is slightly above 2 and increases monotonically with @xmath25 ( see the table ) .",
    "the behavior of the immediate dependence of @xmath4 on @xmath8 can be demonstrated if we plot the value of @xmath4 versus @xmath8 for a certain temperature ( fig .",

    "it turns out that some samples do not reveal any dependence of @xmath4 on @xmath8 whereas the remaining samples feature a strong dependence of the form @xmath137 .",
    "the increase in the exponent @xmath79 with enhancing disorder ( see the table ) and the existence of the above - mentioned relationship between @xmath4 and @xmath8 ( @xmath137 ) suggest that as the films are disordered , there occurs a pure @xmath138 ",

    "indeed , the condition @xmath140 defines a particular temperature @xmath141 ( @xmath142 is the velocity of phonons of different polarization ) below which a dirty limit case occurs , and this temperature increases with decreasing @xmath8 ( see the table ) . in those cases where @xmath143 is below the temperature range within which the dependence @xmath20 makes itself evident , i.e. @xmath144  k",
    ", there is no influence of electron mean free path on @xmath4 .",
    "however when @xmath143 is much higher than 10 k , an increase in @xmath79 is observed and the relation between @xmath4 and @xmath8 appears .    in view of the above behavior , the discrepancy between the @xmath79-values for au films given in refs .   can be explained .",
    "the subjects of investigation in refs .   correspond to a pure limit case , where @xmath79 is found to be equal to 2 ; the data in ref .",
    "are true for a dirty limit case ( 0.031.0 k ) where @xmath79 took a value close to 3 .",
    "the problem of reduction of the exponent @xmath79 as opposed to the theoretical predictions is much more difficult to interpret . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : int ] , according to refs .",
    "the bulk disordered samples must reveal dependences @xmath145 for @xmath146 and @xmath5 for @xmath14 . since @xmath4 is given by the eliashberg function @xmath147 within the frequency range corresponding to the energy of thermal phonons @xcite :    @xmath148    the reduction of @xmath79 from 3 to 2 within the pure limit corresponds to the occurrence of a linear , rather than quadratic , dependence of the eliashberg function on @xmath149 at low frequencies .",
    "the change in the eliashberg function form at low phonon frequencies may be accounted for by the modification of the phonon spectrum in thin films . in this case for the 2d phonon spectrum a dependence @xmath150 is assumed to be observed in the dirty limit @xcite and @xmath40 in the pure one ( rigorous theory is unavailable ) . assuming two - dimensionality of the phonon spectrum allowed the authors of ref .   to fit the calculated data on @xmath4 with the experimental ones , and the process of heat escape to the environment at electron overheating was successfully interpreted in ref .",
    "on the same ground .",
    "many authors believe that the 2d phonon spectrum in a thin film is due to the quantum size effect for the phonons when the phonon wavelength @xmath151 is comparable to the film thickness .",
    "this problem is consequently discussed for free standing film .",
    "for @xmath152 there exist flexural waves with the quadratic dispersion relations @xmath153 ( ref .  ) in a free standing film which are characterized by a linear dependence of phonon state density on @xmath149  : @xmath154 .",
    "since @xmath155 , for au films 10 nm thick the above condition is realized at temperatures below 3 k. at higher temperatures the phonon spectrum of free standing film is also quantized @xcite .",
    "thus , one can expect a 2d behavior of phonons due to the size quantization in a free standing film or in a film with weak adhesion to the substrate .",
    "for the film on substrate only those phonons are prone to quantization which have undergone complete internal reflection from the metal - substrate boundary , i.e. fly up to the boundary at an angle larger than the critical one @xmath156 ( @xmath157 , the angle is measured from the normal to the boundary and @xmath158 refers to the substrate ) . for the considered gold - sapphire system @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "the phonons within the critical angle accomplish acoustic metal - substrate coupling .",
    "we should bear in mind that in the studied real film - substrate systems the acoustic coupling is far from being weak .",
    "therefore , the results for free films can not be applied in our case in full measure .",
    "the interpretation of the problem proposed in ref .   takes into account the fact that the film is on a substrate .",
    "concurrent with the above mentioned waves , we suppose that love s waves may occur in the film - substrate system .",
    "the love s waves are surface waves whose displacement vector is parallel to the surface and perpendicular to the direction of propagation .",
    "solution of the problem for the love s waves in a film - substrate system results in an uncommon dispersion relation .",
    "thus , when the conditions @xmath161 and @xmath162 ( @xmath163 being the medium density ) are met , the dispersion relation for the love s waves is of the form @xmath164 ( ref .  )",
    "similar to that for 2d plasmons .",
    "these conditions are well fulfilled for the gold - sapphire system .",
    "the 1d love s wave which obeyed the above dispersion relation , gives rise to a linear frequency spectrum @xcite , which is possibly responsible for the observed behavior of the temperature dependence of @xmath10 for the gold films on sapphire substrates .",
    "now we discuss the behavior of @xmath17 on disordering in the temperature region where @xmath165 .",
    "the values of @xmath17 was found to increase with disorder and the increase in @xmath25 ( see the table ) .",
    "this result is quite unexpected because it is commonly assumed that the increase in the frequency of elastic scattering processes @xmath166 also involves an increase in the frequency of spin - orbit processes @xmath167 .",
    "the ratio of the above frequencies , @xmath168 , characterizes the probability of spin - orbit process on elastic electron scattering .",
    "an approximate estimation of this quantity can be given by the following relationship for metals with inversion symmetry of crystal lattice @xcite :    @xmath169    if the spin - orbit interaction is of importance in the field of a heavy impurity , or    @xmath170    if the spin - orbit interaction is essential in the matrix ( on scattering by a light impurity ) . here",

    "the dependence of @xmath175 on @xmath173 was truly close to @xmath176 , and the values of @xmath177 corresponded to the probability of surface scattering followed by a spin flip appeared to be rather high ( @xmath178@xmath179 ) for heavy metals ( pb , sn , ga , cu ) compared to the expected values for bulk scattering ( approximately by a factor of three ) . in refs .",
    "the values of @xmath17 for different degrees of disordering were determined from the effects of weak localization in mg , ag and al films and the validity of the relation @xmath180 was confirmed .",
    "one would think that the uncommon behavior of @xmath17 with disordering , observed by us in the au films , could be attributed to the modification of the nature of main scatterers in the film after irradiation with ar ions : the number of scatterers and , hence , the frequency of elastic scattering processes , @xmath166 , after the irradiation increases while the proportion of scatterers with strong spin - orbit interaction decreases .",
    "this could have been due to the implanted ar ions if the latter had a weak spin - orbit interaction compared to the matrix atoms",
    ". however , it seems to us that the high concentration of ar ions in the film is unlikely because for their average energy of 2 kev their free path within the irradiated film is more than the film thickness ( a significant part of ions with high energy pierces the film and penetrates the sio sublayer ) .",
    "moreover , the film heating on irradiation ( up to @xmath181@xmath182c ) results in that a large part of the implanted ar ions escapes it . by the data given in ref .",
    ", the maximum ar concentration in irradiated films of noble metals is no more than 1% . for significant influence of ar impurities on @xmath17 ,",
    "it is necessary that the ar concentration should be higher at least by the order of magnitude .",
    "let us assume that the ar irradiation results in an increase in the concentration of radiation defects of the film structure and leads to enhancement of diffusion behavior of electron motion in the film .",
    "if the dominant mechanism of elastic scattering in the perfect film is a surface scattering , it turns out that the enhancement of disordering causes a bulk scattering to be dominant . as in ref .  , the frequency @xmath17 can be represented as a sum of contributions from bulk and surface scattering to spin - orbit relaxation :    @xmath183    it is quite possible that the probability of spin flip under electron scattering by surface is much higher than under scattering by impurity in the bulk , i.e. @xmath184 .",
    "this suggestion is supported by the experimental results presented in ref .  , where the dependence of @xmath167 on mg film thickness was studied .",
    "the same result was obtained for films of different metals in ref .   and also for bi films in ref .   where the localization correction to magnetoresistance was studied in parallel magnetic field in conditions where the quantum size effect manifests itself .",
    "in view of the above inequality , the processes of spin - orbit scattering by surface are to be dominant in perfect films where the second term prevails . with enhancing disorder , the contribution of these processes decreases because of the increase in the time , @xmath185 , of diffusion electron motion from surface to surface .",
    "the contribution of spin - orbit scattering by impurities in the bulk material having the probability @xmath186 becomes appreciable .",
    "this increases the time @xmath17 .",
    "we can illustrate this by a simple transformation of eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) .",
    "let us assume , that @xmath187 , and the time of diffusion from one surface to the other is @xmath188 , and @xmath189 . then eq .  (",
    "[ 11 ] ) becomes    @xmath190    or    @xmath191    the experimental points are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.6 ] in the @xmath192 vs. @xmath193 coordinates . the straight line in fig .",
    "[ fig.6 ] obtained by the least - square technique has @xmath194 and @xmath195 , which supports the assumption that @xmath184 .",
    "thus , with the high probability of spin flip during the electron scattering at the surface , the enhanced disorder in the film reduces the frequency of collisions with the surface and is responsible for the decrease in the spin - orbit scattering rate , observed with decreasing of electron mean free path .",
    "the irradiation of au films with 3.5 kev ar ions has made it possible to obtain samples with the crystal lattice disorder in a wide range .",
    "the experiments resulted in the previously unknown influence of disorder on the processes of phase and spin - orbit relaxation of electrons .",
    "\\2 . for a particular degree of disordering ,",
    "the frequency of electron - phonon scattering begins to decrease directly with the electron mean free path and the exponent @xmath79 in temperature dependence @xmath196 somewhat increases compared to @xmath197 for weakly disordered films ( see the table ) .",
    "the variation in @xmath4 on disordering may be attributed to the pure - dirty limit transition .",
    "attention is attracted to the fact that the reduced values of exponents @xmath79 in the `` pure '' limits ( cf . the theoretical predictions for 3d metals ) are related to the surface waves of love - type , which present in the film - substrate system .",
    "these waves obey an unusual dispersion law and have a linear frequency spectrum .",
    "the abnormal decrease in the rate of spin - orbit scattering with enhancing disorder is treated assuming that the probability of spin flip is higher under electron scattering by surface than by impurities in the bulk .",
    "we are very grateful to v.v.bobkov and v.i.glushko for ar - ion irradiation of au films and electron microscopy study , a.i.kopeliovich , v.a.shklovsky and e.s.syrkin for their helpful discussion of the results and e.yu.kopeichenko for his assistance in the processing of the experimental data .",
