    "an electron - hole gas , where the electrons reside in a two - dimensional layer and the holes in another two - dimensional layer ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : layers ] ) , represents a many - body system with controllable attractive coulomb interaction and controllable density . for weak attraction the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) approach predicts the formation of cooper pairs , whereas strong attraction results in the formation of composite bosons , known as indirect excitons .",
    "besides these two fundamental regimes other phases may exist .",
    "in particular , at higher densities new correlated phases could appear when the coulomb electron - hole attraction is changed from weak to strong coupling through a change of the interlayer separation .",
    "this could enable us to create an electron - hole plasma , a state of superfluid cooper pairs and even a mott state at high densities .",
    "the physics would go beyond the weakly interacting electron gas in conventional superconductors , where the attraction is created by electron - phonon coupling  @xcite .",
    "the double layer system can be realized in the form of semiconductor coupled quantum wells ( cqws ) or by two graphene layers ( gls ) .",
    "the cqws are conceptually simple : negative electrons are trapped in a two - dimensional plane , while an equal number of positive holes is trapped in a parallel plane a distance @xmath0 .",
    "superfluidity in cqws has been predicted by lozovik and yudson in 1975  lozovik , which stimulated intensive theoretical research for a number of new physical phenomena such as persistent electric currents and unusual effects in strong magnetic fields  shevchenko , lerner , dzjubenko , kallin , knox , yoshioka , littlewood , vignale , ulloa .",
    "moreover , it led to a series of experimental studies that have focused on observing these effects  snoke_paper , snoke_paper_sc , chemla , krivolapchuk , timofeev , zrenner , sivan , snoke , em .",
    "other theoretical studies considered the bcs phase of electron - hole cooper pairs in a dense electron - hole system  @xcite and a dilute gas of dipolar ( indirect ) excitons , where the latter are formed as bound states of electron - hole pairs in cqws  @xcite .",
    "besides the condensation of excitons and the formation of a superfluid state , their dissociation into the electron - hole plasma ( ehp ) is also of interest and was studied experimentally for gaas / algaas cqws in ref .  [ ] .",
    "the phase diagram of indirect excitons formed by the spatially separated electrons and holes in gaas / algaas cqws was analyzed experimentally , and it was shown that the exciton system undergoes a phase transition to an unbound electron - hole plasma for increasing temperatures  @xcite . this transition has been manifested as an abrupt change in the photoluminescence linewidth and in the peak energy at some critical power density and temperature .",
    "the dynamics of the ionization transition of the excitons was studied by using the rate equation  @xcite .",
    "the fraction of ionized carriers in an electron - hole - exciton gas in a photoexcited semiconductor was derived theoretically by applying the mass - action equation , or saha equation , for the number of free carriers in equilibrium  @xcite .    within the hartree - fock approximation",
    "the ionization equilibrium of an electron - hole plasma and the exciton phase was investigated in a highly excited semiconductor in ref .  [ ] with special attention to the influence of many - particle effects such as screening and lowering of the ionization energy .",
    "the dissociation of excitons in gaas - gaalas quantum wells with increasing excitation was studied within two different theoretical approaches  @xcite . from a thermodynamic approach",
    "a simple criterion for the transition to the ehp was obtained : the sum of chemical potentials of carriers , reflecting the effective shrinkage of the band edge , crosses the exciton energy with increasing excitation .",
    "alternatively , a spectral approach , based on the semiconductor bloch equations within linear optical response , was used to analyze the quasi - particle properties of carriers and the dynamical screening between electron - hole pairs . while the first is effectively a one - particle approach , in the second the whole two - particle spectrum",
    "is studied  @xcite .",
    "the transition between the excitons and the ehp was obtained in hartree - fock approximation for qws  manzke_njp .",
    "this transition was also studied using the thermodynamic perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "the condensation of cooper pairs formed by spatially separated electrons and holes was also the subject of more recent studies in a system of two isolated graphene layers @xcite .",
    "the electron - electron interactions in decoupled gls were analyzed in detail , where it was found that the hartree - fock approach provides a quite accurate description of the inter - particle interactions in gls  @xcite .",
    "the electron - hole superfluidity caused by formation of the bcs phase by cooper electron - hole pairs in two parallel bilayer graphene sheets was proposed recently  perali , where also the hartree - fock approximation was applied . in ref .",
    "@xcite was predicted the superfluidity of quasi - two - dimensional dipole excitons in double - layer graphene in the presence of band gaps .    according to a detailed study of the ionization degree of the electron - hole plasma in semiconductor quantum wells  @xcite , the dependence of the degree of ionization on the carrier density depends dramatically on the electron and hole masses and the dielectric constant , which are different for different semiconductors . in ref .",
    "[ ] the phase transition between the exciton phase and the ehp was analyzed .",
    "finally , the transition from an exciton gas to an ehp could have important applications to all - optical switching  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we predict a first oder phase transition between the bcs phase and an insulating mott phase for strong electron - hole attraction at low temperatures for the electron - hole gas in the cqws when one filled with electrons , the other with holes .",
    "this transition can be observed at the small interlayer separation @xmath0 and high electron and hole densities .",
    "we study the phase diagram of the electron - hole gas formed in two layers within a mean - field approximation for the pairing order parameter as a function of interaction strength , temperature and density .",

    ", we analyze the order of the phase transitions with respect to the temperature as well as the temperature dependence of the order parameter , using the results of the mean - field calculations at nonzero temperatures .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in sec .",

    "the phase diagram of a translational invariant electron - hole system is presented in sec .",
    "finally , the discussion of the results and conclusions follow in sections  [ disc ] and [ conc ] , respectively .",

    "the spin of electrons and holes is neglected here because we are not interested in magnetization effects .",
    "moreover , we assume the simple parabolic dispersion relations @xmath6 , @xmath7 for the electrons and holes with electron @xmath8 and hole @xmath9 masses , respectively . to take care of the band structure of a realistic system",
    "we introduce an upper cut - off energy @xmath10 in such way that the kinetic energy of the quasiparticles is constrained by @xmath11 . in eq .",
    "( [ hamilton ] ) @xmath12 is the attractive electron - hole interaction , that is different for the paired electrons and holes in cqwa and two separated graphene layers and can be defined by the 2d fourier image of the screened electron - hole attraction @xmath13 as @xcite @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) @xmath15 is the interaction strength , @xmath16 is the dielectric constant of the cqws or the dielectric between gls , @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the electron charge , @xmath19 , and @xmath0 is the thickness of the dielectric interlayer .    using the notation @xmath20 and @xmath21 for the fermi energy and the fermi momentum , respectively , the fermi momentum of the 2d fermi system is defined as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the 2d density of electrons and holes .",
    "estimating @xmath24 for the parameters of the real quantum wells , we obtain @xmath25 , and we use the following approximation for the potential energy of the electron - hole attraction given by eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a material dependent parameter ( cf .",
    "table [ table:1 ] ) given by @xmath28    now we consider the grand - canonical equilibrium of the electron - hole gas , and define the expectation value of the operator @xmath29 with respect to the boltzmann distribution @xmath30 at temperature @xmath31 and the trace with respect to all fermionic quantum states of the hamiltonian @xmath32 as : o = 1z tr ,  z = tr  , [ partition00 ] where @xmath33 .",
    "the free energy @xmath34 then reads @xmath35 , from which we obtain the densities of electrons and holes as n_e , h=-  , [ density00 ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the chemical potentials of the electron and hole gases , respectively .",
    "in order to evaluate the free energy of the interacting electron - hole gas we apply a mean - field approximation .",
    "this is based on the idea that we replace the interaction terms in the hamiltonian ( [ hamilton ] ) , which are quartic expression with respect to the fermion operators , by a quadratic term that couples to a mean field .",
    "there are several options for choosing the mean field .",
    "very common is to use a hartree - fock like approximation that couples to the fermion densities @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "then the mean field is a self - energy @xmath39 , where the real part @xmath40 describes a shift of the fermi energy and the imaginary part @xmath41 a damping of the quantum dynamics .",

    "we can assume that the effective shift of the fermi energy by the self - energy is already taken into account , which implies that the fermi energy is the renormalized one .",
    "within this approximation we can perform the trace in eq .",
    "( [ partition00 ] ) with respect to non - interacting electrons and holes .",
    "these states are created as product states by applying the fermionic creation and annihilation operators @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) and @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) of eq .",
    "( [ hamilton ] ) to a vacuum state .",
    "then the free energy in momentum representation reads ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) f = -  , [ mft1 ] where @xmath47 is the single particle energy with @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "it should be noticed that we consider the case where the masses of the electrons and holes are different .",
    "this results in the extra term related to r in eq .",
    "when the effective masses of the electrons and holes are equal this term vanish .",
    "now the gap order parameter @xmath50 is determined as the minimum of the free energy .",
    "the density of particles can be evaluated using eq .",
    "( [ density00 ] ) , which allows us to fix the fermi energy @xmath51 by adjusting @xmath52 with the experimental results .",
    "this allow us to calculate first the pairing order parameter @xmath50 as the minimum of the free energy , after inserting the solution in @xmath34 , then the average density @xmath52 .    by increasing the laser pumping intensity , the electron - hole density increases and one can observe a phase transition from a dilute electron - hole plasma to a bcs ( paired electron - hole system ) state and another phase transition from the bcs state to dense ehp .",
    "both phase transitions are the second order transition .",
    "besides the transition from the bcs phase to the ehp we would also expect a transition similar to the mott transition in a repulsive hubbard model .",
    "this is due to the fact that there is always competition between kinetic energy and interaction energy . in the strongly interating regime",
    "the interaction suppresses the kinetic energy and an insulating mott phase appears @xcite .",
    "a similar effect is expected for our electron - hole gas in the strongly interacting regime .    before we provide a more detailed mean - field calculation , a brief qualitative discussion of the electron - hole gas",
    "the properties of the system are controlled by three parameters , namely the fermi energy , the interaction strength and the temperature .",
    "the influence of these parameters one can understand in terms of the free energy in eq .",
    "( [ mft1 ] ) as follows : ( i ) changing the fermi energy @xmath53 results in a change of the density .",
    "( ii ) an increase of the temperature implies an increase of the thermal fluctuations of the electron - hole gas .",
    "( iii ) finally , increasing the interaction ( e.g. , by reducing the distance @xmath0 between the layers ) , will reduce the size of the cooper pairs in the bcs regime : with the screened coulomb interaction in ( [ static_screening ] ) an increasing interaction means a decreasing size of cooper pairs , namely the appearance of cooper pairs with larger values of @xmath54 .",
    "this is easy to justify by using the linearized mean - field equation @xmath55 for small @xmath50 that gives _ ~f_1_with a positive prefactor @xmath56 , which is independent of @xmath57 .",
    "this equation has a nonzero solution ( i.e. , a cooper pair ) if the factor in front of @xmath58 on the right - hand side is 1 . for large values of @xmath57",
    "this is the case only for a sufficiently large value of @xmath54 . in other words , for the strongly interacting regime",
    "the cooper pairs become more like tightly bound electron - hole pairs , which can be considered as hard - core bosons .",
    "the hard core is a consequence of the pauli principle .",
    "this picture suggests to present the electron - hole gas for weak interaction in terms of a mean - field theory and for strong interaction as a hard - core bose gas .",
    "below we focus on the mean - field theory alone , using eq .",
    "( [ mft1 ] ) for the free energy and study the crossover to strong interaction and high densities within this approach .",
    "the free energy expression ( [ mft1 ] ) is now considered for a translational invariant system with weak interaction . in this case",
    "we expect that the order parameter is uniform , i.e. is independent on the momentum : @xmath59 .",
    "this means that the cooper pairs are extended object , which may be justified at least for weak interaction @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is defined as the fourier component of the inverse coulomb interaction @xmath62 .",
    "then the free energy in eq .",

    "the latter allows us to discuss the phase diagram of the electron - hole gas in a simple manner .",
    "first of all , the stability of the system requires @xmath81 .",

    "they are distinguished by the fact that the position of the minima @xmath84 goes continuously ( second order transition ) or discontinuously ( first order transition ) to zero . in terms of our truncated free energy @xmath80 ,",
    "the second order transition is characterized by one minimum at @xmath83 , which is realized for @xmath85 , and by a maximum at @xmath83 and another minimum at @xmath82 .",
    "the latter is realized for @xmath86 and @xmath87 . the first order transition , on the other hand , is characterized by two minima and a maximum in between .",

    "this equation and the condition for a second order phase transition @xmath95 , @xmath86 shall be used in the subsequent section to evaluate the phase diagram of the electron - hole gas .",
    "the phase diagram of the electron - hole gas within mean - field approximation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] , which clearly shows a paired bcs phase under the dome and a non - bcs phase above the dome .",
    "this structure indicates that for a sufficiently strong interaction at intermediate densities the electron - hole gas has a tendency to form paired states . at lower or at higher densities there is no pairing effect .",
    "the horizontal line at @xmath96 is important .",
    "it separates the strongly interacting regime from the weakly interacting regime , which can be distinguished by the fact that the former has a first order transition to the non - bcs state and the latter has a second order transition ( see also fig . [",
    "fig : energy ] ) .",
    "if the pairing order parameter vanishes , the electron - hole gas is just a gas of non - interacting electrons and holes with the hamiltonian in the mean - field approximation : @xmath97 .",
    "the interaction is taken care of by a renormalized chemical potential @xmath5 .",
    "if the fermi energy @xmath98 is inside the band ( i.e. , for @xmath99 , @xmath100 ) this describes an electron - hole plasma .",
    "on the other hand , if the fermi energy is above the band ( i.e , for @xmath101 ) there are no extended ( bloch ) states and the system is in a localized or insulating phase . using here the analogy with the hard - core bose gas , this could be a mott state of hard - core bosons @xcite .",
    "however , this regime can not be described correctly by our mean - field theory .     and @xmath93 of the free energy of eq . ( [ truncated ] ) as a function of @xmath102 for @xmath103 .",

    "as a result of our mean - field approach we have found that the electron - hole gas in two separate layers has three characteristic different regimes . according to the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] , there is a dilute electron - hole gas at weak interaction without pairing of electrons and holes in the two layers . in other words ,",
    "the interaction is too weak to create pairing , therefore , the electrons and the holes are independent .",
    "the effect of the interaction in this phase is a renormalization of the fermi energy , as it can be analyzed by a hartree - fock approximation . either by increasing the densities due to an increase of the fermi energies or by increasing the interaction strength ( e.g. , by reducing the interlayer distance @xmath0 ) a second order phase transition to a bcs phase with cooper pairs appears .",
    "being in the bcs phase there are two possibilities for changing parameters : either to increase the densities at a fixed moderate interaction strength or increase simultaneously the densities and the interaction strength . in the former case the paired gas undergos another second order phase transition to a dense electron - hole gas , whereas in the latter case it is possible that we have a first order transition from the bcs state to a bosonic mott state .",
    "the mott state itself is not directly describable within our mean - field approach but its existence is indicated by the fact that strongly coupled electron - hole gas can be represented by a dense hard - core bose gas . for the latter the existence of a mott state has been established @xcite .",
