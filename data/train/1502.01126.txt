    "fermi_/lat @xcite as well as at tev energies @xcite .",
    "the jet of ic310 , extending in the outward direction from the center of the cluster led to early assignment of this object as a head - tail radio galaxy @xcite .",
    "however , using the very - long - baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) technique , a parsec - scale one - sided jet was found to follow the large - scale jet within about @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the alignment of the jet at different scales , without any hints of bending put in doubt the above classification .",
    "instead , the inner jet appears to be blazar - like with a missing counter jet due to relativistically boosted emission .",
    "further indications for transitional behavior between a radio galaxy and a blazar were found in ic310 in various energy ranges @xcite .",

    "it allows observations of gamma - ray sources with energies above 50gev . during the observations of the perseus cluster performed in the end of 2012 magic telescopes revealed an extreme gamma - ray flare from ic310 on the night of 12/13@xmath2 of november @xcite .",
    "in addition , the source was observed in radio band by european vlbi network ( evn ) during october / november 2012 .    in section  [ sec :",

    "the signal extraction and calibration of the data , the image parametrization , the direction and energy reconstruction as well as the gamma - hadron separation were applied with the standard analysis software mars as described in @xcite . in the night of the flare a strong signal of 507 gamma - like events above 300gev in the region around ic310 in excess of the background estimated as 47 events was observed . due to still limited statistics of events and a very rapid variability behavior ,",
    "the classical approach for the calculation of light curves in gamma - ray astronomy which is based on the fixed width of the time bins is not optimal in this case .",
    "we used instead a method similar to the one commonly used for data of x - ray observatories for the computing of energy spectra .",
    "we first identify all periods in the data during which the telescopes were not operational ( in particular @xmath10min gaps every 20min when the telescope is slewing and reconfiguring for the next data run ) .",
    "afterwards , we bin the remaining time periods based on a fixed number ( in this case 9 ) of on events per bin .",
    "we estimate the number of background events in each time bin from four off - source regions at the same distance from the camera center . using toy mc simulations we validated that this method limits the bias in flux value and its error @xcite . as the signal to",

    "the emission is highly variable , fitting the light curve in the full time range with a constant reveals a @xmath18 of 199/58 corresponding to a probability of @xmath19 .",
    "we use the rapidly rising part of the 1@xmath20 big flare ( mjd 56244.062056244.0652 ) in order to compute the conservative , slowest doubling time , @xmath21 , which is still consistent with the magic data .",

    "the ultrafast variability casts a shadow of doubt on the current shock - in - jet paradigm .",
    "the moving shock plasma leads to a shortening of the observed variability time scale @xmath50 compared with the variability time scale @xmath51 in a frame comoving with the shock given by @xmath52 .",
    "this effect is often used to explain ultrafast variability from blazars @xcite in which @xmath53 can be nearly arbitrarily large providing that the jet moving with large lorentz factor is observed at a very small angle . in the case of ic310",
    "however the estimation of the observation angle @xmath54 obtained from the radio observations constrain the maximum doppler factor to be @xmath55 .",
    "all of these attempts to explain the sub - horizon scale variability with relativistic projection effects alone encounter a fundamental problem @xcite . if the perturbations giving rise to the blazar variability are injected at the jet base , the time scale of the flux variations in the frame comoving with the jet is affected by time dilation with lorentz factor @xmath56 . in blazars where @xmath57 , the lorentz factor cancels out , and",
    "the observed variability time scale is ultimately bounded below by @xmath58 .",
    "additionally , a very high value of the doppler factor is required to avoid the absorption of the tev gamma rays due to interactions with low - energy synchrotron photons .",
    "such synchrotron photons are inevitably produced together with the gamma rays in the shock - in - jet scenario . the optical depth to pair creation by the gamma rays",
    "can be approximated by @xmath59 .",
    "adopting , conservatively , a non - thermal infrared luminosity of @xmath60 of the gamma - ray luminosity during the flare , the emission region would be transparent to the emission of 10  tev gamma rays only if @xmath61 .    in summary",
    ", trying to interpret the ic310 flare in the framework of the shock - in - jet model meets difficulties .",
    "alternative models can involve stars falling into the jet @xcite , mini - jet structures within the jets @xcite or magnetospheric models @xcite . in the case of ic310 star - in - jet model can not provide sufficient luminosity to explain the tev flare @xcite .",
    "also jets - in - jet models suffer from rapidly dropping luminosity at larger observation angles @xcite .",
    "moreover the magnetic reconnection which can led to production of such mini - jets is expected to occur in the main jet rather at larger distances from the black hole .    in magnetospheric models ,",
    "particle acceleration is assumed occur in electric fields parallel to the magnetic fields .",
    "this mechanism is common to the particle - starved magnetospheres of pulsars , but it could also operate in the magnetospheres anchored to the ergospheres of accreting black holes ( see fig .",

    "the rotation of the black hole induces a charge - separated magnetosphere ( red ) with polar vacuum gap regions ( yellow ) . in the gaps ,",
    "the electric field of the magnetosphere has a component parallel to the magnetic field accelerating particles to ultra - relativistic energies .",
    "inverse - compton scattering and intense pair production due to interactions with low - energy thermal photons from the plasma accreted by the black hole leads to the observed gamma rays .",

    ", scaledwidth=49.0% ]    electric fields can exist in vacuum gaps when the density of charge carriers is too low to cause their shortcut , i.e. below the so - called goldreich - julian charge density .",
    "electron - positron pairs in excess of the goldreich - julian charge density can be produced thermally by photon - photon collisions in a hot accretion torus or corona surrounding the black hole .",
    "it has also been suggested , that particles can be injected by the reconnection of twisted magnetic loops in the accretion flow @xcite .",
    "a depletion of charges from thermal pair production is expected to happen when the accretion rate becomes very low . in this late phase of their accretion history ,",
    "supermassive black holes are expected to have spun up to maximal rotation .",
    "black holes can sustain a poynting flux jet by virtue of the blandford - znajek mechanism @xcite .",
    "jet collimation takes place rather far away from the black hole , i.e. at the scale of the light cylinder beyond @xmath63 .",
    "gaps could be located at various angles with the jet axis corresponding to the polar and outer gaps in pulsar magnetospheres leading to fan beams at rather large angles with the jet axis .",
    "as the gap height and seed particle content depend sensitively on plasma turbulence and accretion rate , the gap emission is expected to be highly variable .",
    "for an accretion rate of @xmath64 of the eddington accretion rate and maximal black hole rotation , the gap height in ic  310 is expected to be @xmath65 @xcite which is in line with the variability times seen in the observations .",
    "depending on the electron temperature and geometry of the radiatively inefficient accretion flow , its thermal cyclotron luminosity can be low enough to warrant the absence of pair creation attenuation in the spectrum of gamma rays . in this picture , the intermittent variability witnessed in ic  310 is due to a runaway effect .",
    "as particles accelerate to ultrahigh energies , electromagnetic cascades develop multiplying the number of charge carriers until their current shortcuts the gap .",
    "the excess particles are then swept away with the jet flow , until the gap reappears .",
    "radio galaxies and blazars with very low accretion rates allow us to obtain a glimpse of the jet formation process near supermassive black holes .",
    "observations of ic310 performed with the magic telescopes showed variability with time scale below 5min , shorter than the light crossing time of the event horizon of its black hole .",
    "the commonly used in agns shock - in - jet models have troubles to explain such emission .",
    "a plausible explanation involves emission from vacuum gaps in the magnetosphere of ic310 .",
    "interestingly , such explanation invite to explore analogies with pulsars where particle acceleration takes place in two stages . in the first stage ,",
    "particle acceleration occurs in the gaps of a charge - separated magnetosphere anchored in the ergosphere of a rotating black hole , and in a second stage at shock waves in the force - free wind beyond the outer light cylinder .",
