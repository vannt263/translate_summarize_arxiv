    "phase ordering in fluids is an important process that still needs to be completely understood in many cases of practical relevance .",
    "when a fluid is quenched from an initial disordered state into a regime of two - phase coexistence below the spinodal line , domains of the two phases are formed and grow with time .",
    "the typical size @xmath1 of domains follows the power law @xmath2 with the growth exponent @xmath3 being _ universal _ in the sense that it does not depend on the microscopic details of the fluid , assuming only a few values related to the physical mechanism operating during phase separation @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamics is in general relevant and the coupling with the velocity field can change the value of the growth exponent @xmath3 from that of purely diffusive growth @xcite .    in this paper we consider the ordering of a liquid - vapor system subject to an external field mimicking the effects of gravity .",
    "the role of gravity on phase ordering has been more studied in binary systems . in critical quenches , after an initial diffusive growth with exponent @xmath4 , there is a viscous growth characterized by @xmath0 followed by an inertial regime with @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "gravity becomes relevant when heavy domains resting on top of light ones become gravitationally unstable , thus accelerating the domain growth @xcite .",
    "this occurs at late stages making inertial growth difficult to observe .",
    "a theoretical analysis neglecting hydrodynamical contributions suggests an exponent @xmath6 for the size of domains in the vertical direction @xcite .",
    "there are few studies of phase separation for liquid - vapor systems . in two - dimensional simulations the values @xmath7 for high viscosity fluids and @xmath5 for low - viscosity fluids",
    "have been found @xcite .",
    "we are not aware of simulations made on a liquid - vapor system subject to gravity , where the growth exponent is measured .",
    "we address this problem by applying the lattice boltzmann method ( lbm ) to simulate a van der waals fluid described by the navier - stokes and the continuity equation .",
    "lbm have been proved successful in studying fluids with mesoscopic structures ( liquid - vapor interfaces in our case ) on large time scales , as it is needed for phase separation @xcite . in our approach",
    ", the thermodynamic description is based on a free - energy functional where interfaces are described at a coarse - grained level .",
    "the free - energy interface cost is expressed , as usual in van der waals - landau models , in terms of gradients of the density field .",
    "locally , the fluid satisfies the van der waals state equation .",
    "a finite difference version of lbm is implemented where the relationship @xmath8 among the lattice speed @xmath9 and the space and time steps @xmath10 and @xmath11 does no longer hold , as in standard _ collision - streaming _ lbm @xcite .",
    "the rejection of this condition has two advantages .",
    "first , this allows one to further consider multicomponent fluid systems where the masses of the component particles , as well as the lattice speeds , may be no longer identical @xcite .",
    "second , higher order numerical schemes ( including flux limiter schemes ) may be considered in order to reduce unphysical effects like the spurious velocity and the numerical viscosity @xcite .",
    "the use of high order numerical schemes in finite difference lbm helps further to improve the numerical stability and accuracy @xcite while providing a convenient alternative to interpolation supplemented lbm @xcite .",
    "our main results is that the sedimentation process induced by gravity is characterized by an exponent @xmath0 independently on the values of viscosity and gravity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "our lbm approach is described in section 2 ; numerical results are shown in section 3 and conclusions will be drawn in section 4 .",
    "in this paper , we use the d2q9 isothermal finite difference lattice boltzmann model in two dimensions , which is well known in the literature @xcite .",
    "this model relies on the following set of @xmath12 evolution equations for the non - dimensionalized distribution functions @xmath13 , @xmath14 , defined in the nodes @xmath15 of a lattice with @xmath16 nodes @xcite @xmath17 \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{\\,\\delta t\\,}{\\,\\chi c^{2}\\,}\\,{\\mathbf{f}}\\cdot\\,\\left[\\ , { \\mathbf{e}}_{i}\\,-\\ , { \\mathbf{u}}({\\mathbf{r}},t)\\,\\right]\\,f^{eq}_{i}({\\mathbf{r}},t ) .",

    "the local values of the fluid quantities ( particle number density @xmath19 and velocity @xmath20 ) are derived from the distribution functions , as follows @xmath21 the velocity vectors @xmath22 are given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a non - dimensionalized speed , @xmath25 is the non - dimensionalized system temperature , and @xmath26 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the following reference quantities @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is avogadro s number , @xmath31 is the molar volume at the critical point of temperature @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the mass of the fluid particles and @xmath34 is boltzmann s constant , may be used to get the non - dimensionalized values of the particle number density , temperature and speed , respectively .",
    "the system size is chosen as reference length @xmath35 , the reference quantities @xmath36 and @xmath37 for time and acceleration follow from @xmath38 since we use finite difference schemes @xcite to evolve the particle distribution functions according to eq.([lbevol ] ) , the lattice spacing @xmath10 and the time step @xmath10 are no longer related to the lattice speed @xmath9 as in standard lattice boltzmann models @xcite , the temperature @xmath39 is now a control parameter in our simulations .",
    "this feature of the finite difference approach allows us to change the system temperature @xmath39 ( and hence also the lattice speed @xmath9 ) while preserving the lattice spacing @xmath10 and the system size in each direction ( i.e. , the corresponding number of lattice nodes ) . in such models",
    "there is more freedom to choose the discrete velocity set , as done recently in a thermal model @xcite where the possibility of having different sets of velocities allows to release the constraint of constant temperature .",

    ", we will consider the case of an acceleration directed upwards : @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",

    "we used the values @xmath93 and @xmath94 , which allow us to access low and high viscosity regimes , respectively , as shown in a previous work where the present model without gravity was used to study the phase separation in liquid - gas systems @xcite .",
    "the process of phase separation depends on the interplay among three main driving forces : the viscous one @xmath95 , the gravity one @xmath96 , and the surface tension one @xmath97",
    ". it may be then useful to evaluate their relative contributions introducing the bond number @xmath98 , the capillary number @xmath99 , and the ratio @xmath100 .",
    "the choice of the input parameters is such to access the ranges @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 .",
    "after the initial stages when the mixture starts to phase separate , the effect of the gravitational force is to accumulate material at walls : the heavy phase ( liquid ) is moved to the top wall and the light phase ( vapor ) stays at the bottom wall .",

    "the main difference that can be observed between the two figures is the presence of many droplets in the case at high viscosity as compared to the case at low viscosity .",
    "the reason is due to the fact that in the latter case hydrodynamics is effective in coalescing droplets , thus producing a more homogeneous pattern .     in the case with @xmath104 , @xmath106 and @xmath83 .",

    "we have a clear and convincing indication that in all the cases the growth is consistent with a power law with growth exponent @xmath0 which depends neither on @xmath90 nor on @xmath92 .",
    "the growth is observed over almost two time decades until the system is entirely separated in two parts of different composition . in particular , we want to stress the fact that the exponent @xmath0 is observed in both cases , when the gravitational force @xmath119 is small compared to the surface tension force @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) , as well as when @xmath119 is small compared to the viscous one @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "this indicates that the existence of the same scaling exponent @xmath3 in the gravity direction is exclusively due to the presence of the gravity force @xmath124 .",
