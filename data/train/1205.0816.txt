    "black holes reside at the centers of most massive galaxies @xcite and their masses ( @xmath5 ) are known to tightly correlate with properties of their host galaxy , like the bulge stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath6 ; e.g. , @xcite ) and the bulge luminosity ( @xmath7 ; e.g. , @xcite ) . playing a fundamental role in establishing the empirical @xmath5 @xmath4 host galaxy relationships over the past 15 years",

    "in fact , _ hst _ spectroscopic observations have lead to about 50 of the 70 black hole mass measurements made to date .",
    "more recently , adaptive optics ( ao ) systems on large ground - based telescopes have become an attractive alternative for obtaining high spatial resolution data .",
    "these systems correct for wavefront distortions caused by turbulence in the earth s atmosphere using a natural guide star or a laser guide star ( lgs ) as a reference .",
    "they are often used in conjunction with an integral field unit ( ifu ) , which can map out the two - dimensional ( 2d ) velocity field very efficiently compared to traditional long - slit spectrographs . in addition , ao systems operating in the near infrared on @xmath8 m telescopes are able to probe deep into the central regions of galaxies that previously presented significant observational challenges with the 2.4 m _ hst _",
    ", such as giant ellipticals with low - surface brightness cores and galaxy nuclei obscured by dust .",
    "ao - assisted ifus will undoubtedly have a major impact on the field of supermassive black hole detection , and black hole mass measurements using this technology have already become increasingly more prevalent in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "measurements of black hole masses are most often made through the dynamical modeling of gas disks or stars .",
    "gas dynamical modeling is conceptually simple , and the method can be applied to galaxies containing nuclear gas disks in circular rotation .",
    "the main drawback of this technique is that the gas can be influenced by non - gravitational forces , and the assumption of circular rotation must be verified .",
    "furthermore , many of the observed gas disks in early - type galaxies exhibit velocity dispersions in excess of those expected from just rotational motion alone . this internal velocity dispersion can be quite large , ranging from @xmath9@xmath10 km s@xmath11 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the physical nature of the intrinsic velocity dispersion is not understood .",
    "one interpretation is that the intrinsic velocity dispersion is the result of local microturbulence , but the bulk motion of the gas remains at the circular velocity @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the intrinsic velocity dispersion could be dynamically important , providing pressure support to the gas disk .",
    "models that do not account for this effect will underestimate the true black hole mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , stellar dynamical modeling is the most widely used method .",
    "however , extracting a secure black hole mass measurement from the observed kinematics can be challenging due to the complexity of the models .",
    "recent adjustments to several previous stellar dynamical measurements have been made after identifying significant systematic effects due to degeneracies between the dark matter halo and stellar mass - to - light ratio @xcite , insufficient coverage of the phase space occupied by tangential orbits @xcite , and the effects of triaxiality @xcite .",
    "other possible sources of error , such as the choice of regularization @xcite and the uncertain inclinations of early - type galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have lead to further debate about the accuracy of stellar dynamical mass measurements .    since gas and stellar dynamical modeling methods suffer from different systematic effects , carrying out consistency tests between the two techniques",
    "is crucial . only by applying both mass measurement methods to the same object",
    "can we address important unanswered questions regarding the black hole scaling relations .",
    "is there a systematic difference between the masses derived from the two methods , and if so , how does this affect the slope of the relations ? how much of the scatter in the @xmath5 @xmath4 host galaxy relationships is the result of inconsistencies between stellar and gas dynamical measurements ?",
    "theoretical interpretations of @xmath5 @xmath4 host galaxy correlations range from the black hole being an essential component in galaxy evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to simply being the result of random mergers without the need for a coevolution of black holes and galaxies @xcite . understanding the shape and cosmic scatter of the relations , especially at the sparsely populated upper- and lower - mass ends ,",

    "this necessary consistency check has only been attempted on a few galaxies with mixed results .",
    "stellar and gas dynamical models have been applied to ic 1459 @xcite and ngc 3379 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in both these galaxies , the gas kinematics turned out to be disturbed and not compatible with regular disklike rotation .",
    "consequently , the ionized gas does not give a useful measurement of the black hole mass , and the galaxies are not suitable for a proper comparison between the two methods .",
    "in the cases of ngc 3227 and ngc 4151 , the gas dynamical black hole mass measurements by @xcite are generally consistent with the stellar dynamical masses reported by @xcite and @xcite . however , @xcite could not find a single best fitting model for ngc 4151 , and label their stellar dynamical result as tentative .",
    "@xcite applied both methods to ngc 4335 , and found a stellar dynamical mass that is at least five times larger than the gas dynamical determination .",
    "the black holes in m87 and cen  a have been the subject of numerous gas and stellar dynamical studies . while early examinations of the stellar dynamics ( see review by @xcite , and references therein ) produced similar mass estimates for the black hole in m87 as the gas dynamical measurements @xcite , the most recent stellar dynamical mass from @xcite is about a factor of two larger . finally , there is a great variation in the cen  a gas dynamical black hole mass measurements , mainly due to uncertainties in the inclination of the gas disk ( @xcite , 2006 , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the latest gas dynamical measurement of @xcite is significantly smaller than the stellar dynamical measurement of @xcite ( by about a factor of four ) , but is in agreement with the stellar dynamical measurement by @xcite . with only a few direct comparisons between the gas and stellar dynamical techniques ,",
    "clearly more objects need to be examined .",
    "an excellent target for such a comparison study is ngc 3998 , which is a nearby , s0 galaxy with a low ionization nuclear emission - line region ( liner ) nucleus @xcite .",

    ", we describe a measurement of the black hole in ngc 3998 using orbit - based stellar dynamical models .",
    "we will compare the stellar dynamical black hole mass measurement to the existing gas dynamical measurement by @xcite in order to test whether the two methods give consistent results when applied to the same galaxy .",
    "we begin by presenting the imaging observations and the determination of the galaxy s stellar mass distribution in  [ sec : img_obs ] and  [ sec : stellarmass ] .",
    "we describe the spectroscopic observations in  [ sec : spec_obs ] , and the measurement of the stellar kinematics in  [ sec : kinematics ] .",
    "models of the point - spread function ( psf ) are discussed in  [ sec : psf ] . in  [ sec : modeling ] , we provide a brief overview of the stellar dynamical technique , and its application to ngc 3998 , as well as present the modeling results in  [ sec : results ] . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we examine the stellar orbital structure of the galaxy , compare the stellar dynamical mass measurement to gas dynamical determination , and place the black hole in ngc 3998 on the @xmath15 @xmath4 host galaxy relationships . throughout this paper , we adopt a distance to ngc 3998 of 13.7 mpc @xcite .",
    "imaging observations are essential components in the orbit - based stellar dynamical models , and are used to derive the galaxy s luminosity density .",
    "we obtained a wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) f791w image of ngc 3998 centered on the planetary camera ( pc ) detector from the _ hst _ archive .",
    "the _ hst _ image of ngc 3998 was originally acquired under program go-5924 , and the total exposure time was 100 s. the wfpc2 image , with a pixel scale of 0046 and 01 for the pc and wide - field chips , provides high angular resolution imaging suitable for constructing a luminous mass model near the black hole , however the image only extends out to a radius of @xmath1610  ( 0.6 kpc ) .",
    "we therefore also included in the analysis a deep @xmath17-band image ( courtesy of lsker et al .",
    ", in preparation ) taken with the wide - field infrared camera ( wircam ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the 3.6 m canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "the image has a spatial scale of 03 pixel@xmath11 and covers a 30@xmath1830  field .",
    "the total exposure time was 442 s , and we were able to measure the galaxy s surface brightness profile out to a radius of @xmath16250  ( 16.6 kpc ) .",
    "the ground - based image was used to generate the mass model on large spatial scales , which is helpful in constraining the intrinsic shape of the galaxy in the stellar dynamical models .",
    "we parameterized the wfpc2 f791w and wircam @xmath17-band images of ngc 3998 as the sum of 2d gaussians using the multi - gaussian expansion ( mge ) method @xcite .",
    "the mge method has often been used to model high - resolution and ground - based images ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and we used the mge method here because it has the advantage of being able to reproduce a large range of density distributions while also allowing for the deprojection to be carried out analytically .",
    "mge models were fit to both images simultaneously while also accounting for the _ hst _ psf .",
    "the psf itself was described as the sum of 25 positive and negative gaussians , which were found by applying the mge software to a tiny tim model @xcite .",
    "our best - fit mge parametrization of the galaxy was composed of 12 gaussians , where the innermost gaussian was constrained to be round and the position angles ( pa ) of the gaussian components were required to be the same .",
    "this model produced an excellent fit to the imaging data , as can be seen in figure [ fig : mge2d ] .",
    "in addition , in figure [ fig : mge1d ] , we present the surface brightness profile , the mge model , and the percent error averaged along the azimuthal axis . the mge model was corrected for galactic extinction using the @xcite values given by the nasa / ipac extragalactic database and the surface density was converted to @xmath1-band solar units using the wfpc2 calibration by @xcite . in table",
    "[ tab : mge ] , we provide the best - fit values of the mge parameters .",
    "we further note that there are no significant emission lines within the f791w bandpass @xcite .",
    "although our adopted mge model requires each gaussian component to have the same pa , we fit an additional mge model that allowed for isophotal twists .",
    "we detected very small changes to the pa , of typically @xmath19 , between the components .",
    "furthermore , when using this mge parameterization as input into the orbit - based stellar dynamical models , we found worse agreement between the observed and predicted stellar kinematics . as a result , we do not consider the mge model that allows for isophotal twists any longer , and focus solely on the mge parametrization that constrains each component to have the same pa .    when constructing mass models of galaxies containing an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , often the innermost gaussian of the mge model is assumed to arise from non - thermal emission and is excluded from the stellar mass distribution .",
    "the nucleus of ngc 3998 has been spectroscopically classified as a type 1.9 liner @xcite , and an unresolved , variable uv source , a compact radio source , and an x - ray source have all been detected at the galaxy s center @xcite .",
    "all of this evidence suggests that ngc 3998 hosts an agn .",
    "however , the galaxy also exhibits a cuspy surface brightness profile , and some starlight may still be contained within the innermost gaussian .",
    "we therefore ran orbit - based stellar dynamical models using mge parameterizations that both included and excluded this central gaussian , and will discuss the results in  [ sec : results ] and  [ subsec : more_errors ] .",
    "these descriptions represent the two extremes : in one case all the light from the innermost gaussian is attributed to the stars and in the other scenario all the light is assigned to the agn .",

    "we obtained 300 s exposures of the galaxy nucleus and sky , following the sequence object - object - object - sky object - object - object - sky , and recorded 3.8 hours of on - source integration time . each object exposure",
    "was dithered 02 perpendicular to the long - axis of the ifu in order to remove bad pixels and to obtain a slightly wider field of view of 12 @xmath18 32 .",
    "in addition , we observed k and m giant stars for use as velocity templates in the same observational setup as was used for the galaxy , and a0  v stars for telluric correction .",
    "the data were reduced using the osiris data reduction pipeline v2.3 .",
    "the pipeline includes subtraction of a sky frame , glitch identification and cosmic ray cleaning , extraction of the spectra into a data cube ( with two spatial dimensions , @xmath24 and @xmath25 corresponding to the short and long axis of the ifu , and one spectral dimension ) , wavelength calibration , atmospheric dispersion correction , and telluric correction using the extracted one - dimensional ( 1d ) spectrum of an a0  v star .",
    "while the reduction pipeline is capable of performing scaled sky subtraction following the algorithm outlined by @xcite , we found that the current implementation did not work well for our data set and produced strong sky residuals in the reduced cubes .",
    "we instead opted for a direct subtraction method , where we subtracted a sky exposure from the previous two object frames and from the following object frame .",
    "thus , the sky and object frames were separated in time by at most 600 s , and the direct subtraction method worked well .",
    "after all of the individual galaxy cubes were reduced , we determined the spatial @xmath24 and @xmath25 offsets between the first galaxy cube and each of the remaining object cubes .",
    "this was done by summing along the wavelength axis of the data cubes to generate flux maps , then cross - correlating the images . using these offsets ,",
    "the individual object cubes were aligned and averaged to produce the final galaxy data cube .",
    "the velocity template star observations were reduced in a similar manner , but an additional step was included to extract a 1d spectrum from the data cube using a circular aperture with a radius of 7 pixels .",
    "we retrieved stis observations of ngc 3998 made on 1999 march 10 under program go-7350 from the _ hst _ archive .",
    "ngc 3998 was observed with the 52x0.2 aperture at eight slit positions , all of which were aligned at a pa of @xmath26 , within @xmath27 of the galaxy s major axis .",
    "two successive exposures were obtained at each slit position to aid in the removal of cosmic rays , and a shift of about four pixels in the spatial direction was made between positions .",
    "the average exposure time recorded at each slit position was 2730 s. the g750 m grating , centered on 8561  , was read out in an unbinned mode , which provided a scale of 00507 pixel@xmath11 along the spatial axis and 0554   pixel@xmath11 along the dispersion direction . following the observation of the galaxy at each slit position , a contemporaneous flat field was taken .",
    "in addition to the galaxy observations , the k3 iii star hr 260 was observed as part of program 7350 for use as a velocity template . in order to build up a larger library",
    ", we also searched the _ hst _ archives for other suitable stars , using as a guide the previously published stellar dynamical black hole mass measurements made from stis data .",
    "we retrieved an additional four stars , observed using the same stis setup , from the archive : the k0 iii star hr 7615 ( go-7566 ) , the g8 iii star hd 141680 ( go-8591 ) , and the k2 iii and g5 v stars hd 73471 and hd 115617 ( go-8928 ) .",
    "the data were reduced by running individual iraf tasks within the standard space telescope science institute ( stsci ) calstis pipeline . with these tasks ,",
    "the overscan region was trimmed , the bias and dark files were subtracted , flat - field corrections were applied , cr - split exposures were combined to reject cosmic rays , wavelength and flux calibration were performed , and the data were rectified for geometric distortions .",
    "we chose to run individual segments of the pipeline independently , following the procedure detailed in the stis data handbook v6.0 @xcite , instead of running the wrapper calstis program so that a couple of important modifications could be made .",
    "specifically , we found that the dark calibration file provided by stsci , which is constructed from several long dark exposures taken over the course of a week , contained very strong hot pixels that did not subtract well and left numerous negative pixels in the galaxy spectral images .",
    "this poor subtraction is likely due to pixels that vary on timescales of less than a week .",
    "we therefore followed a similar approach to @xcite , and modified the dark file by replacing any pixels that deviated by more than @xmath28 with a median value .",
    "after the initial processing was complete , we included an additional cleaning step and used la - cosmic @xcite to remove the hot pixels remaining after the subtraction our modified dark file .",
    "we then applied the geometric distortion correction to the cleaned images . additionally , we used the contemporaneous flat field exposures taken at each of the slit positions to remove the obvious fringe pattern affecting the spectra .",
    "iraf tasks were used to reduce and normalize the flat field observations , shift and scale the fringes in the normalized flat such that they would match those in the galaxy images , and to finally apply the fringe correction .",
    "the reduced , geometrically rectified , fringe - corrected spectral images at each of the eight slit positions taken along the galaxy s major axis were then aligned and combined to produce the final 2d galaxy spectrum .",
    "the same procedure was applied to the five velocity standard stars observed with stis , but as a final step , we constructed a 1d spectrum by adding together 3 spectral rows above and below the central row from the 2d images .",

    "we additionally observed k giant stars for use as velocity templates , and the flux standard star feige 34 , in the same observational setup as was employed for ngc 3998 .",
    "we reduced the lris data using iraf .",
    "the initial processing steps of the 2d spectral images included trim and bias subtraction , flat fielding , and cosmic ray cleaning .",
    "for the ngc 3998 exposures , we also geometrically rectified the 2d spectra so that both the wavelength and spatial axes would run parallel along rows and columns , respectively . during this process",
    ", we used the hg , ar , and ne arc lamp exposures acquired immediately following the ngc 3998 observations to wavelength calibrate the spectral images .",
    "we removed the sky background by subtracting the two dithered spectral images taken at each pa from one another .",
    "the difference images were spatially aligned , averaged together , and trimmed to remove the negative features resulting from the pair subtraction . as a final reduction step ,",
    "we compared a calibrated 1d standard star spectrum to a 1d spectrum of the galaxy extracted using the apall task to determine the multiplicative factor ( as a function of wavelength ) that was needed to bring the two spectra into agreement .",
    "the scaling was then applied to the 2d galaxy spectrum to produce a final , flux - calibrated spectral image of ngc 3998 at each pa .",
    "the velocity template stars were reduced following a slightly different procedure because we only required a 1d spectrum from the 2d image .",
    "after the initial image processing , we applied the same spectral rectification and wavelength calibration to the 2d spectra of the velocity template stars as was used for the ngc 3998 spectra .",
    "we performed a secondary correction to the wavelength calibration by applying a small linear shift along the dispersion axis so that two bright sky lines bounding the triplet region matched the known wavelengths of 8430   and 8886  .",
    "we then extracted a 1d spectrum with apall using a 53 aperture radius and sky regions that were 84 in width beginning at a distance of 23 .",
    "the velocity template spectra were flux calibrated using an extracted 1d spectrum of the standard star feige 34 .",
    "from the osiris , stis , and lris data , we extracted 1d spectra over a range of spatial locations and measured the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) , which we parameterized with the first four gauss - hermite moments ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 ) .",
    "measurement of the losvd requires spectra with a high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "typically , a s / n of @xmath940 per spectral and spatial resolution element are needed in order to reliably determine @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which quantify asymmetric and symmetric deviations from a gaussian ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we used the voronoi binning algorithm @xcite in order to achieve the best spatial resolution possible given such a requirement on the minimum s / n .",
    "the stellar kinematics in each of the spatial bins were then measured using the penalized pixel fitting ( ppxf ) method of @xcite . with this method , logarithmically rebinned galaxy spectra are fit in pixel space using a stellar template that is convolved with the losvd .",
    "the ppxf code minimizes template mismatch by finding an optimal stellar template that is composed of a linear combination of spectra from a library .",
    "the libraries were designed to contain stars that are representative of the galaxy s expected stellar population .",
    "when measuring the stellar kinematics from the osiris data , we used a template library composed of 20 stars , consisting of mostly k and m giants ( spectral types",
    "k0 @xmath4 k5 and m0 @xmath4 m5 ) , a k4 v star , and a g9 v star .",
    "the stis kinematics were determined using a library of five stars ( g8 iii @xmath4 k3 iii , and g5 v ) , and the lris kinematics were extracted using a library of eight k0 iii @xmath4 k3 iii stars .    the optimal stellar template was determined just once by using ppxf to fit a very high s / n spectrum generated by summing the spectra over all spatial locations .",
    "once the optimal stellar template was found , ppxf was used to measure the kinematics in each spatial bin by holding fixed the relative weights of the stars that comprise the optimal template .",
    "we did , however , allow the coefficients of an additive legendre polynomial of degree 1 and a multiplicative legendre polynomial of degree 2 to vary .",
    "the additive polynomial was used to model the agn continuum , and the multiplicative polynomial was included to correct continuum shape differences between the optimal stellar template and the galaxy spectra due to imperfect flux calibration and reddening .",
    "errors on the kinematic measurements were estimated using a set of monte carlo simulations . during each realization",
    ", random gaussian noise was added to the observed spectrum from each bin based upon the standard deviation of the ppxf model residuals .",
    "the losvd was measured with the penalization turned off in order to produce realistic uncertainties . from 100 realizations , we determined the 1@xmath34 errors from the standard deviation of the resulting distributions .",
    "we also tested the robustness of our kinematic measurements by assuming different continuum models , each with various combinations of additive and multiplicative polynomials of degree @xmath37 .",
    "we additionally used ppxf to measure just @xmath33 and @xmath34 in each spatial bin , as well as allowed for the relative contributions of the stars making up the optimal stellar template to vary between spatial bins .",
    "regardless of the continuum model used , the number of gauss - hermite moments extracted , or whether a new optimal template was fit for each bin , we found consistent results for all but a few spatial bins .",
    "the kinematics measured from these few spatial bins were deemed unreliable and excluded from further analysis .    as a final step",
    ", we determined the systematic offsets in the odd gauss - hermite moments directly from the data using the point - symmetrization routine described in appendix a of @xcite .",
    "the offset for the first odd gauss - hermite moment corresponds to the recession velocity of the galaxy , and a systematic shift in the second odd gauss - hermite moment may result from slight template mismatch effects .",
    "the offsets were subtracted from the @xmath33 and @xmath35 values determined with ppxf .    although the systematic offsets in the odd moments were measured with the point - symmetrization code , we did not symmetrize the kinematics before using them as inputs into the orbit - based dynamical models .",
    "often the observed kinematics are symmetrized ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) because the dynamical models can only produce predicted kinematics that are bi- or point - symmetric .",
    "thus , symmetrizing the input kinematics reduces the noise in the observations and aids in visual comparisons between various models .",
    "however , the symmetrization routine assumes that the galaxy nucleus is exactly centered on one of the ifu lenslets .",
    "while this is true for the reduced data sets from the sauron ifu @xcite , for which the symmetrization code was originally designed , the assumption does not hold for the osiris data .",
    "consequently , our best - fit stellar dynamical model , presented in  [ sec : results ] , was determined using non - symmetrized kinematics , but in  [ subsec : more_errors ] we also test the effect on @xmath5 of symmetrizing the kinematics before running the orbit - based stellar dynamical models .",
    "we used the ppxf method to measure the kinematics from the osiris data over a wavelength range of @xmath38 m . for ngc 3998 , this wavelength region included three very strong co bandhead absorption features : @xmath39co , @xmath40co , and @xmath41co .",
    "the kinematics were constrained mainly by these prominent co bandheads , although weaker and absorption lines were also detected .",
    "we note that no emission lines were detected with the osiris kbb filter .",
    "the stellar kinematics were measured from 90 spatial bins , 10 of which contain just a single lenslet and fall within the central @xmath9015 region .",
    "the s / n of the spectra ( taken to be the ratio of median value of the binned spectrum to the standard deviation of the ppxf model residuals ) ranged from @xmath42 , with a median value of 58 .",
    "the optimal template was composed of eight stars , with a k5 iii star contributing a majority of the flux . in figure",
    "[ fig : spec_osiris ] , we show example spectra from two spatial bins and the optimal template broadened by the best - fit losvd , as well as the spectrum from the k5 iii star .    the kinematics show that the galaxy is rapidly rotating , with velocities of @xmath43 km s@xmath11 over the osiris ifu , and there is an anti - correlation between @xmath35 and @xmath33 .",
    "although the @xmath36 kinematics are expected to be symmetric about the center , with a peak or dip at the nucleus , we find @xmath36 to be noisy , without any clear trends .",
    "in contrast , the velocity dispersion shows a very strong peak at the nucleus , rising from @xmath44270 km s@xmath11 in the outer regions to @xmath44560 km s@xmath11 at the center .",
    "the errors on the velocity dispersion measurements are quite large at nucleus and will be discussed further in  [ subsec : more_errors ] , but outside of the innermost lenslets , we find typical errors of 10 km s@xmath11 , 13 km s@xmath11 , 0.02 , and 0.03 , for @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "ngc 3998 contains an agn , which dilutes the observed stellar features , and can lead to difficulties in extracting the kinematics near the nucleus . during the spectral fitting with ppxf , we included an additive polynomial to account for the agn dilution .",
    "however , we measured large uncertainties on the kinematics extracted from four of the innermost lenslets , suggesting that ppxf can not disentangle the agn from the stellar component in a consistent manner . our final best - fit model presented in  [ sec : results ]",
    "was found using the kinematic measurements and errors from all the osiris bins , however we further tested the effect on @xmath5 when the central kinematics are excluded from the modeling ( see  [ subsec : more_errors ] ) .",
    "we measured the stellar kinematics from the triplet lines using the ppxf routine to fit an optimal stellar template over the wavelength range @xmath45  .",
    "the optimal template was composed of two stars : a k2 iii star , which contributed most of the flux to the template , and a k3 iii star . near the nucleus",

    "furthermore , we were unable to measure the stellar kinematics within @xmath1602 of the nucleus due to the agn . in the end , we extracted reliable kinematics from eight spatial bins extending from about 02 to 1  from the nucleus .",
    "the spectra in the eight bins had a s / n of @xmath46 with a median value of @xmath47 .",

    "the stis kinematics show that the galaxy is rotating quickly with velocities of @xmath48 km s@xmath11 over the inner @xmath49 , that there is a rise in velocity dispersion from @xmath44 290 km s@xmath11 at 1  to @xmath44 370 km s@xmath11 at 02 , and that @xmath35 is anti - correlated with the velocity .",
    "again , we are unable to detect any significant trends in @xmath36 .",

    "however , for completeness , the final best - fit model described in  [ sec : results ] was determined using the stis data , along with the osiris and lris measurements .",

    "the median errors for @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 were 8 km s@xmath11 , 9 km s@xmath11 , 0.02 , and 0.03 for @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "we find excellent agreement between kinematics measured from the osiris , stis , and lris data .",
    "while template mismatch is a common source of uncertainty when extracting stellar kinematics , at least it is encouraging to find consistent measurements from different instruments over different wavelength regions using different velocity template stars . in figure",
    "[ fig : kin_rad ] , we show the four gauss - hermite moments measured from the three different instruments as a function of projected distance from the nucleus .",
    "an important input into the stellar dynamical models is the spatial psf .",
    "however , determining the osiris psf is especially complicated because the quality of the ao correction varies with time and numerous data cubes ( obtained over the course of two nights ) were mosaiced together .",
    "@xcite highlight several ways to estimate the psf from ao - corrected ifu data , and for this work we used a method that compares the osiris data cube to a deconvolved _ hst _ image , as has been employed by @xcite .",
    "we used the mge model generated from the wfpc2 791w image ( discussed in  [ sec : stellarmass ] ) , which already has the _ hst _ psf removed , and convolved it with a model for the osiris psf .",
    "the osiris psf is taken to be three concentric circular 2d gaussians parameterized by the dispersions and relative weights of the components . the convolved image",
    "is then compared to the osiris data cube , summed along the wavelength axis , and the parameters of the psf are varied to determine the best fit .",
    "we found that the three components have dispersions of 001 , 004 , and 028 with relative weights of 0.19 , 0.60 , and 0.21 .",
    "thus , we were able to achieve a good ao correction and the psf core has a fwhm of @xmath901 .",
    "to model the stis psf , we used tiny tim @xcite to reconstruct the psf for a monochromatic filter passband at 8651  . fitting two concentric circular 2d gaussians to the tiny tim image",
    ", we found that the psf can be characterized by a narrow component with @xmath56 003 and a weight of 0.76 , plus a broad component with @xmath56 012 and a weight of 0.24 .",
    "these dispersion values and weights were used as input into the stellar dynamical models , which require a psf to be described with circularly symmetric gaussians .    for the lris psf , we examined the spatial distribution of the eight velocity template stars that were observed on the same night as ngc 3998 .",
    "we fit a single gaussian to a spatial cut at 8600   through the geometrically rectified 2d spectra , and found an average dispersion of @xmath56 035 .",

    "the galaxy potential consists of contributions from the black hole , the stars , and dark matter .",
    "we take the three - dimensional ( 3d ) stellar mass to be described as the sum of multiple coaxial gaussian distributions , which are determined by deprojecting the mge model and assuming a constant stellar mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the deprojection is carried out by choosing a direction from which the galaxy is observed , characterized by the euler angles @xmath58 ( corresponding to the inclination angle ) , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 . with a set of these viewing angles , each component @xmath61 of the mge model",

    "the schwarzschild method additionally allows for dark halo properties to be determined , but our stellar kinematics extend out to a radius of @xmath1615  ( @xmath161 kpc ) , and we are unable to differentiate between various dark halo models .",
    "consequently , the model results presented in  [ sec : results ] do not include dark matter , and the galaxy potential is calculated from the contributions of the black hole and the stars alone .",
    "however , we do test the effect on the inferred black hole mass by incorporating a couple of fixed dark halo models in  [ subsec : more_errors ] .",
    "given the galaxy potential , a representative orbit library is generated , and the initial conditions of the orbits are chosen such that the three integrals of motion are sampled .",
    "the orbits are integrated and projected onto the observable quantities ( the location on the sky and the losvd parameters ) while accounting for the psf and aperture binning .",
    "next , weights for each orbit are found such that superposition of orbits matches the kinematics in the least - squares sense while also satisfying contraints imposed by the stellar density in each aperture and 3d bin .",
    "many dynamical models are calculated with different values for the parameters of interest , namely @xmath5 , @xmath57 , and the viewing angles @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 ( or equivalently the intrinsic shape parameters @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 ) .",

    "we bundle together @xmath69 orbits with adjacent starting positions and sum their observables , resulting in a total of 600,000 orbits .",
    "such orbital dithering is commonly used in the construction of schwarzschild models to ensure a smooth distribution function , and further smoothing can be applied after the linear orbital superposition through the adoption of a regularization term .",
    "our results presented in  [ sec : results ] are based upon models run without regularization , however we note that including a small amount of regularization did not change the best - fit black hole mass .",
    "we estimate the model fitting uncertainty on @xmath5 ( @xmath57 ) by marginalizing over @xmath57 ( @xmath5 ) and the shape parameters .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , who advise the use of @xmath3 errors for @xmath5 measurements due to the numerical uncertainties associated with schwarzschild modeling , we quote the @xmath3 uncertainties on @xmath5 and @xmath57 for one degree of freedom .",
    "this corresponds to a change of 9.0 in @xmath68 from the minimum value .",
    "the statistical uncertainties on the intrinsic shape parameters are derived differently , using the confidence levels established by @xcite and applied during the studies of m32 and ngc 3379 by @xcite . the confidence interval for the intrinsic shape parameters",
    "are set based upon the expected standard deviation in @xmath68 , or @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the number of observables used to constrain the model ( 1072 for ngc 3998 ) .",
    "while the @xmath5 determination is influenced by a the innermost kinematical measurements , the intrinsic shape parameters are set by a much larger number of observables , such that the expected scatter in @xmath68 becomes important and is much larger than the standard @xmath72 criterion @xcite .",
    "it is computationally prohibitive to explore parameter space for the full range of @xmath5 , @xmath57 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 values simultaneously , so we initially fixed @xmath5 and varied @xmath57 and the shape parameters .",
    "we sampled axis ratios of @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and all possible values of @xmath67 in steps of @xmath75 , and evaluated 11 @xmath1-band @xmath57 values between 4.16 and 6.24 @xmath76 .",
    "the minimum values of @xmath65 and @xmath66 were chosen to reflect the smallest values that have been observed in other galaxies as well as to probe very triaxial shapes , and the upper bound on @xmath66 was set by the average flattening of 2d gaussians in the mge model for ngc 3998 . with our sampling",
    ", we have covered 128 different galaxy shapes , 5 of which are oblate axisymmetric .",
    "this procedure assumes that the shape parameters do not depend on the black hole mass , which was shown to be true for the specific cases of m32 and ngc 3379 @xcite .",
    "we tested whether this also holds for ngc 3998 by first setting @xmath77 [ the @xcite gas dynamical black hole mass measurement adjusted for our assumed distance ] , and then using a larger mass of @xmath78 [ the mass predicted from the @xmath14 relationship when a bulge stellar velocity dispersion of @xmath79 km s@xmath11 is assumed @xcite ] .",
    "we found that the best - fit intrinsic shapes differ for the two @xmath5 values tested : an oblate axisymmetric shape , with @xmath80 and @xmath81 at an effective radius ( @xmath82 ) is preferred when @xmath77 , and a round , but triaxial shape , with @xmath83 and @xmath84 at @xmath85 is found when @xmath86 .    given that the best - fit intrinsic shape changes with @xmath5 , we constructed a model grid by varying @xmath5 between @xmath87 and @xmath88 and examining 11 @xmath1-band @xmath57 values between 4.2 and 6.2 @xmath76 , while also sampling ten shapes .",
    "these shapes have the lowest ten @xmath68 values from the two grid runs described above , and they fully encompass the @xmath3 uncertainties of @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 when @xmath5 is set to @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",

    "we additionally compare the osiris velocity dispersions to those predicted from models with the best - fit mass of @xmath96 , a smaller black hole with @xmath97 , and a larger black hole with @xmath98 in figure [ fig : osiris_3panel ] .",
    "this figure demonstrates that our best - fit black hole mass is a reasonable one , and clear differences between the predicted velocity dispersions for the models with a smaller and larger black hole and the observed kinematics can be seen by eye .",
    "the more massive black hole produces velocity dispersions that are much too large at the center , while the smaller black hole is unable to match the sharp rise in the observed nuclear velocity dispersion .",
    "we calculated another model grid holding @xmath5 fixed at @xmath96 and allowing @xmath57 and the shape parameters to vary .",
    "this grid allowed us to derive the uncertainties on the shape parameters , having previously determined the best - fit black hole mass .",
    "we again sampled 128 galaxy shapes with axis ratios of @xmath99 , @xmath74 , and all possible values of @xmath67 , and examined 11 @xmath1-band @xmath57 values between 4.2 and 6.2 @xmath76 .",

    "an upper error bar of zero is measured for @xmath66 because this ratio is limited by the observed average flattening of the 2d gaussians from the mge model .",
    "thus , the best - fit intrinsic shape is as round as the _ hst_/cfht images allow , and is consistent with an oblate axisymmetric spheroid .",
    "furthermore , we were unable to place strong constrains on the viewing angles , finding that the inclination ranges from @xmath103 to @xmath104 ( edge - on ) , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 ( @xmath3 uncertainties )",
    ". these results are consistent with previous stellar dynamical studies of other early - type galaxies , in particular the work of @xcite and @xcite who find that the viewing angles are highly degenerate .",
    "the @xmath3 errors on @xmath5 presented above represent the formal model fitting uncertainty , and account for the random noise within the stellar dynamical models .",
    "we further explored other sources of uncertainty that are not included in the statistical errors but that could have an effect the @xmath5 determination .",
    "we summarize the results of these model grids below .    _ stellar density distribution _ : care must be taken to separate the agn light from the stellar contribution when constructing the luminous mass model .",
    "often , this is accomplished by removing the innermost gaussian component from the mge model , however ngc 3998 exhibits a steep surface brightness profile and some starlight may still be contained within the central component . in the analysis presented above , we assumed that all of the light from the central mge gaussian was due to the stars . here",
    ", we consider the other extreme , where all the light from the inner mge component comes from the agn .",
    "after removing the central gaussian component from the mge model , we followed the same procedure outlined in ",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "we first calculated stellar dynamical models fixing @xmath5 to @xmath107 and @xmath90 in order to determine the most probable galaxy shapes .",
    "then , we ran model grids sampling over the ten best galaxy shapes , while varying @xmath5 between @xmath108 and @xmath109 and @xmath57 between 4.2 and 6.2 @xmath76 .",
    "we found a very round , but oblate , intrinsic shape for the galaxy , with @xmath110 and an @xmath1-band @xmath111 ( @xmath3 uncertainties ) .",
    "this best - fit stellar dynamical model is a worse description of the observations ( @xmath112 ) compared to the best model presented previously in  [",
    "sec : results ] ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "moreover , when excluding the central mge component , the dynamical models for every combination of @xmath5 and @xmath57 have a higher @xmath68 than the stellar dynamical models constructed from a mass model with all 12 gaussian components .",
    "for this reason , and because the black hole masses determined using the two mge models are fully consistent within the statistical uncertainties , covering nearly identical @xmath5 ranges , we view the best - fit model from  [ sec : results ] as our final result .    _ dark halo _ : work by @xcite has raised concerns that stellar dynamical black hole mass measurements may be underestimated if both the black hole and the dark matter halo are not simultaneously modeled .",
    "the reasoning is that without a dark halo , the @xmath57 may be overestimated in order to compensate for the missing mass at large radii .",
    "the @xmath57 is assumed to be constant in the models , and thus a smaller black hole would be needed to match the observed nuclear kinematics . by including the contribution of dark matter in their re - examination of m87 , @xcite found that the black hole mass increased by about a factor of two .",
    "likewise , @xcite noted a strong dependence of the black hole mass on the dark halo when studying ngc 6086 .",
    "both objects exhibit shallow stellar luminosity profiles and have massive , concentrated dark matter halos , limiting the radial range over which the stars dominate the gravitational potential and the assumption of a constant @xmath57 holds .",
    "moreover , these studies utilized data in which the quality and/or spatial resolution was unable to limit the degeneracy between the black hole and stellar mass - to - light ratio in the central regions .",
    "in contrast , black hole mass measurements based upon high s / n observations well within the region influenced by the black hole appear to be less sensitive to the inclusion of dark halos during the modeling @xcite .",
    "we are unable to directly fit for the parameters of a dark halo model because our kinematics do not extend out to large enough radii .",
    "instead , we selected a fixed model for the dark halo .",
    "two commonly used dark halo models are the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile @xcite and a distribution based on a cored logarithmic potential @xcite .",
    "previous work has found that both parameterizations give consistent results @xcite , and here we adopt the profile from a logarithmic potential given by    @xmath114    the parameters @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the asymptotically constant circular velocity and the core radius , within which the dark matter density is approximately constant .",
    "we fixed @xmath115 and @xmath116 to values of @xmath117 km s@xmath11 and @xmath118 kpc , respectively , which were chosen for ngc 3998 using the galaxy @xmath119-band luminosity of @xmath120 reported by the hyperleda database @xcite and the empirical relations by @xcite .",
    "the relationships in @xcite provide a way to select physically motivated parameters for the dark matter halo , and was similarly used by @xcite to test the effects of dark matter on the black hole mass .",
    "when including the dark halo in our stellar dynamical models , we did not observe a significant change in the black hole mass , measuring @xmath121 and an @xmath1-band @xmath122 ( @xmath3 errors ) .",
    "the decrease in the best - fit black hole mass is in the opposite direction as anticipated , but is well within the statistical uncertainties and is likely due to noise in the dynamical models .",
    "a similar result was seen when we incorporated a dark halo that was twice as massive within the radial range covered by the large - scale lris kinematics .",
    "therefore , neglecting the dark matter contribution during the dynamical modeling presented in  [ sec : results ] did not lead to a biased @xmath5 determination .",
    "we attribute this result to the high quality osiris data , which probes regions well within the influence of the black hole and reduces the degeneracy between @xmath5 and @xmath57 , as well as to the galaxy s strong rotation , which also makes the measurement less sensitive to the dark halo .    _",
    "central osiris kinematics _ : contributions from a non - stellar nucleus dilute absorption lines and make the measurement of reliable stellar kinematics challenging . in some instances ,",
    "the agn contribution is so strong that the stellar features are no longer visible in the nuclear spectra @xcite .",
    "this is not the case for ngc 3998 , however we do measure large errors for the kinematics extracted from four of innermost osiris lenslets . as an example , at these locations we found velocity dispersions between @xmath123 and @xmath124 km s@xmath11 with error bars of @xmath125 km s@xmath11 . beyond these four lenslets , but still within @xmath901 of the nucleus , we continued to measure large velocity dispersions of @xmath126 km s@xmath11 but with more reasonable errors of @xmath920 km s@xmath11 . the large uncertainties from the inner osiris bins indicate that the ppxf routine could not model the agn contribution in a consistent fashion within 005 from the nucleus , which in turn may have biased these kinematical measurements . therefore , we excluded the measurements from the central five osiris bins when fitting the orbit - based stellar dynamical models .",
    "doing so led to a best - fit model with @xmath127 and @xmath1-band @xmath128 .",
    "the values and @xmath3 uncertainties for @xmath5 and @xmath57 are the same as found previously in  [ sec : results ] , when all of the osiris kinematics were fit during the modeling .",
    "even if the kinematics measured from four of the innermost osiris lenslets are biased due to agn contamination , there appears to be no subsequent effect on the black hole mass .",
    "this result is not entirely surprising because the stellar dynamical models take into account the errors on the input kinematics , and we have a number of other reliable measurements of the losvd within the black hole sphere of influence .",

    "[ sec : psf ] , the osiris psf was determined by comparing the deconvolved _ hst _",

    "given the difficulties associated with measuring the psf , we therefore additionally considered two extreme parameterizations of the osiris psf to quantify changes in @xmath5 .",
    "both psfs were composed of two concentric , circular , 2d gaussians , and the dispersion of the second component was set at 028 .",
    "we chose 028 because this is the dispersion of the broad component in the osiris psf model presented in ",
    "[ sec : psf ] .",
    "we then constructed a `` poor '' psf , such that the narrow component had a dispersion of 0084 and contributed 15% of the flux to the total psf , and a `` good '' psf , whose narrow component had a dispersion of 0025 ( roughly the @xmath21-band diffraction limit for a 10 m telescope ) and contributed 95% of the flux to the total psf .",
    "the stellar dynamical models based upon the `` bad '' psf yielded a best - fit model with @xmath129 and @xmath1-band @xmath130 , and the models using the `` good '' psf produced best - fit parameters of @xmath131 and @xmath1-band @xmath132 .",
    "thus , even for two extreme psf models , the black hole mass remains within the @xmath3 statistical uncertainties presented in ",
    "[ sec : results ] .    _ symmetrizing the kinematics _",
    ": we removed the systematic offsets in the odd gauss - hermite moments ( e.g. , the galaxy s systemic velocity ) with the point - symmetrization code of @xcite .",
    "in addition to this step , the common practice is to make further adjustments to the kinematical measurements and their errors so that the velocity fields become bi- or point - symmetric , thereby reducing the observational noise .",
    "however , the symmetrization process assumes that the galaxy nucleus is centered on one of the lenslets , which is not necessarily true for the osiris data .",
    "therefore , in  [ sec : results ] , we calculated stellar dynamical models without first requiring the observed velocity fileds to be symmetric . instead ,",
    "if we do symmetrize the input kinematics , we find a best - fit model with @xmath133 and an @xmath1-band @xmath134 .",
    "as expected , the best model is a much better description of the ( symmetrized ) observed kinematics , with @xmath135 and @xmath136 , and larger statistical @xmath3 uncertainties on @xmath5 are found .",
    "although the best - fit black hole mass increased by 17% from the mass derived previously , it remains within the model fitting uncertainties determined in ",
    "[ sec : results ] , and we continue to prefer the dynamical model constrained with the non - symmetrized kinematics .",
    "through orbit - based stellar dynamical modeling we measured a mass of @xmath93 for the black hole in ngc 3998 .",
    "we report @xmath3 statistical errors on the black hole mass , but ran additional model grids to assess the robustness of our mass measurement .",
    "we found no significant changes ( outside the random noise of the models ) to the black hole mass due to these sources of uncertainty , and so we do not make any additional adjustments to the black hole mass or its error bars . with this black hole mass , and a bulge stellar velocity dispersion of 272 km s@xmath11 ( see  [ subsec : mbh_correlations ] below ) , the black hole sphere of influence is @xmath137 07 , which is well resolved by the observations .",
    "we now examine the orbital structure of galaxy , compare the stellar dynamical black hole mass measurement to the existing gas dynamical mass , and place ngc 3998 on the @xmath5 @xmath4 host galaxy relationships .",
    "we examined the internal orbital structure of ngc 3998 using the orbital weights found with the schwarzschild superposition method for our best fitting model ( presented in  [ sec : results ] ) . defining the tangential velocity dispersion as @xmath138 , with @xmath139 being the usual spherical coordinates , we plot the ratio @xmath140 as a function of radius in the top panel of figure [ fig : orbstructure ] . near the nucleus",
    ", the velocity dispersion becomes radially anisotropic reaching values of @xmath141 , while the velocity dispersion is isotropic , deviating by at most @xmath910% from @xmath142 , at radii beyond @xmath901 .",
    "the radial anisotropy near the galaxy s center can be attributed to the large fraction of box orbits : we found that the box orbits contribute @xmath143% to the stellar mass within the inner @xmath901 ( see bottom panel of figure [ fig : orbstructure ] ) .",
    "similarly large contributions from box orbits have been seen when applying triaxial schwarzschild models to other objects as well @xcite . outside of @xmath20 ,",
    "our best - fit model is made up of @xmath965% short - axis tube orbits and @xmath920% long - axis tube orbits .",
    "ngc 3998 is classified as an s0 galaxy , and indeed , our best fitting dynamical model shows evidence for both a bulge and a disk component . in figure",
    "[ fig : dynamical_bulgedisk ] , we show the mass distribution along orbits as a function of average radius and spin , @xmath144 .",
    "the spin is defined as @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the average angular momentum along the @xmath147-direction , @xmath148 is the average radius , and @xmath149 is the average second moment of the orbit .",
    "the figure shows the clear presence of a non - rotating bulge component ( @xmath150 ) and a rotating disk component ( @xmath151 ) , making up 52% and 39% of the mass within the radial range covered by our kinematic measurements .",
    "the remaining 9% of the mass comes from orbits with @xmath152 that fall outside the radial range covered by the osiris kinematics .",
    "thus , the near isotropy at radii larger than @xmath901 seen in figure [ fig : orbstructure ] is due to the presence of a bulge component , while the disk causes the strong rotation that is seen in the osiris , stis , and lris kinematics in figures [ fig : datamodel_osiris ] , [ fig : datamodel_stis ] , and [ fig : datamodel_lris ] .",
    "by modeling the _ hst _ stis gas kinematics as a thin , circularly rotating disk , @xcite derived a black hole mass of @xmath153 ( @xmath154 uncertainties ) . scaling the black hole mass for the distance adopted here ,",
    "their mass measurement becomes @xmath155 .",
    "the stellar dynamical black hole mass is therefore significantly larger , by nearly a factor of four , compared the gas dynamical measurement .",
    "we can not resolve the discrepancy between the stellar and gas dynamical mass measurements for the black hole in ngc 3998 , but discuss a few of the uncertainties associated with both methods below .",
    "the gas kinematics measured from the stis data clearly show organized rotation . however , the line widths predicted from a rotating , dynamically cold , thin - disk model do not fully match the observed velocity dispersions .",
    "@xcite found that the model underestimates the observed rise in the nuclear velocity dispersion by @xmath920% , although larger inconsistencies were seen in the two slit positions immediately adjacent to the central slit . without re - analyzing the stis data for ngc 3998 , it is difficult to determine whether the addition of an intrinsic velocity dispersion to the models would greatly improve the agreement between the predicted and observed line widths , and by how much the gas dynamical black hole mass measurement would then increase if the excess velocity dispersion was considered dynamically important .",
    "previous gas dynamical studies that have assigned a dynamical origin to the internal velocity dispersion have found varying degrees to which the black hole mass is affected . for example , using an asymmetric drift correction to estimate the circular velocity from the observed mean rotational speed , @xcite found a 12% increase in the best - fit black hole mass for ngc 3245 while @xcite found that the mass of the black hole in m84 doubles .",
    "however , we note that the differences between the observed line widths and the predictions from a dynamically cold , rotating disk model for ngc 3245 and m84 were larger than those observed for ngc 3998 .",
    "admittedly , the factor of four increase needed to make the best - fit gas dynamical mass to match the best - fit stellar dynamical measurement is quite large , and the discrepancy probably can not be entirely resolved by assigning a dynamical origin to an intrinsic velocity dispersion .",
    "another source of uncertainty in the gas dynamical black holes mass comes from the inclination of the emission - line disk .",
    "@xcite found that all models with inclinations below @xmath156 produced equally acceptable fits to the data at the @xmath154 level , and that the inferred black hole masses differed by about an order of magnitude for inclination angles @xmath157 and @xmath156 .",
    "a similarly large difference in the ngc 3998 black hole mass for extreme inclination angles was reported by @xcite , who estimated masses of @xmath158 and @xmath159 ( adjusted to our distance ) for inclinations of @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "@xcite ruled out very face - on orientations , @xmath162 , because such angles produced @xmath33-band mass - to - light ratios that are too high compared the predictions of a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) for an old stellar population .",
    "they ultimately reported results using a disk inclination of @xmath163 , and further combined their statistical uncertainties on @xmath5 with the uncertainties resulting from the allowed range in inclination angles between @xmath164 and @xmath156 to derive the @xmath154 error bars on @xmath5 .",
    "interestingly , the results of @xcite indicate that the most massive galaxies have @xmath57 values that are higher than the predictions of a salpeter imf for an old stellar population , thus lower inclinations of the gas disk in ngc 3998 may be acceptable , which would then lead to an increase in the gas dynamical mass measurement .    when constructing the stellar dynamical models presented here , we did not assume axisymmetry or a specific viewing orientation .",
    "however , it is not feasible to explore all possible values for the five parameters simultaneously , and we employed a method that begins by holding fixed @xmath5 while varying the other parameters to find the best - fit intrinsic galaxy shape before searching for the best - fit @xmath5 .",
    "such an approach does not guarantee that a global minimum will be found , and we attempted to alleviate this problem by sampling over ten galaxy shapes ( instead of just the best - fit shape ) while varying @xmath5 and @xmath57 .",
    "the ten shapes were taken from the ten best models when @xmath5 was held at two different values , and the shapes cover the @xmath3 ranges of @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 for the two black hole masses .",
    "thus , we should have covered the possible galaxy shapes while searching for the best fitting @xmath5 and @xmath57 parameters .",
    "one assumption that is made when constructing the stellar dynamical models is that the @xmath57 does not vary with radius .",
    "ngc 3998 has both bulge and disk components , and could also contain a nuclear star cluster @xcite .",
    "if each of these components has a very different stellar population , then a single @xmath57 is not a realistic description of the system .",
    "recent work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has advocated for a bottom - heavy imf in massive early - type galaxies .",
    "thus , if the bulge component of ngc 3998 is indeed rich in dwarf stars , the larger @xmath57 for the bulge region would lead to a smaller stellar dynamical black hole mass measurement .",
    "however , allowing for a radial variation in @xmath57 , in addition to sampling the @xmath5 and three shape parameters , is too computationally expensive to be attempted here .",
    "in contrast , the gas dynamical black hole mass measurement , which relies on the gas kinematics at small radii where the stellar potential is dominated by the bulge , is insensitive to @xmath57 variations . while our assumption of a constant @xmath57 , may effect the derivation of the stellar dynamical black hole mass , the other systematic effects often associated with the stellar dynamical method appear to be minimal .",
    "for example , we found the black hole mass was insensitive to the inclusion of a of dark halo in the model , as well as to the exact osiris psf that was adopted .",
    "moreover , we found good agreement between the kinematics measured from different instruments using different template libraries , suggesting that template mismatch is not a dominate source of uncertainty .",
    "when placing ngc 3998 on the @xmath14 relation , @xcite adopted a bulge stellar velocity dispersion of @xmath79 km s@xmath11 .",
    "the value was taken from the hyperleda database , and was based upon the dispersion values found in the literature at that time , however we are in a position to directly measure the effective stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath165 ) of the bulge component from our data and models .",
    "recent studies of very massive black holes have elected to exclude data within @xmath20 when measuring the effective velocity dispersion @xcite , and here we follow the same approach .",
    "we weight the @xmath34 and @xmath33 measurements obtained from the lris major axis slit with the surface brightness profile set by our mge model , following @xcite , but integrate from @xmath20 to the bulge effective radius .",
    "the bulge effective radius is rather uncertain for ngc 3998 , with literature values ranging between 47 < @xmath82 < 183 @xcite , which in turn produces some uncertainty in the measurement of @xmath165 .",
    "taking an average of the @xmath166 measurements determined from recent optical images @xcite , we find that @xmath167107 and @xmath168 km s@xmath11 for ngc 3998 . for comparison , effective stellar velocity dispersions of @xmath169 km s@xmath11 and @xmath170",
    "km s@xmath11 are measured for @xmath17147 and 183 , respectively .",
    "we note , however , that there is just a single measurement of the large - scale stellar kinematics on each side of the nucleus beyond a radius of 12 , making it difficult to determine @xmath165 for a bulge effective radius of 183 from the lris data .",
    "these @xmath165 measurements are based upon the large - scale kinematics extracted from the major axis lris slit , however the best - fit stellar dynamical model from  [ sec : results ] allows us to predict the luminosity - weighted second moment from a circular aperture of radius @xmath82 .",
    "we measured an effective velocity dispersion of @xmath172 km s@xmath11 when a bulge effective radius of @xmath171107 is used and the central regions within @xmath20 are excluded .",
    "this method provides a formally more correct estimate of @xmath165 , as a circular aperture is being considered instead of relying on a single slit position , but most of stellar velocity dispersions on the @xmath173 relationship were derived using long - slit data and the definition given by @xcite .",
    "thus , for consistency purposes we continue to consider the measurements of @xmath165 made from the lris data .    with an effective stellar velocity dispersion of @xmath174 km s@xmath11 , the black hole mass predicted from the @xmath14 relation",
    "is @xmath175 using the recent calibration of @xcite . instead",
    ", black hole masses of @xmath176 and @xmath177 are predicted from the @xmath14 correlation calibrated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "thus , our stellar dynamical black hole mass measurement falls within the expectations of the relationship when calculating @xmath165 using the large - scale lris kinematics and a bulge effective radius of 107 .",
    "to place ngc 3998 on the @xmath178 correlation , we use the total , extinction corrected , @xmath33-band luminosity of @xmath179 for ngc 3998 from the third reference catalog of bright galaxies ( rc3 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the average of the bulge - to - total ratio ( @xmath180 ) values reported by @xcite and @xcite is @xmath181 , which suggests a @xmath33-band luminosity of @xmath182 for the bulge of ngc 3998 .",
    "such a bulge luminosity translates into a prediction of @xmath183 and @xmath184 for the black hole mass using the @xmath33-band @xmath178 relation of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "even when deliberately overestimating the bulge luminosity , and using the total , @xmath33-band luminosity reported in rc3 , the @xmath185 relation suggests a black hole mass of @xmath186 @xcite .",
    "the stellar dynamical measurement therefore places ngc 3998 well above the @xmath185 relationship . in figure",
    "[ fig : n3998_mbhrels ] , we show the location of ngc 3998 on the black hole mass scaling relations .",
    "to conclude , we have studied the stellar dynamics of the nearby , s0 galaxy , ngc 3998 . from keck lgs",
    "ao osiris observations in the @xmath21 band and archival _ hst _ stis data covering the triplet lines , we mapped out the 2d kinematics within @xmath92of the nucleus with a superb angular resolution of @xmath901 , thereby resolving the gravitational sphere of influence of the black hole .",
    "in addition , we obtained long - slit data at four pas with keck lris to measure the large - scale stellar kinematics , extending to @xmath91 @xmath82 , which is essential for constraining the stellar orbital distribution .",
    "we found that the galaxy is rapidly rotating with @xmath187 km s@xmath11 and exhibits a very sharp rise in the velocity dispersion to values of @xmath44500 km s@xmath11 .",
    "our high - quality spectroscopic data further allowed us to quantify the losvd s asymmetric and symmetric deviations from a gaussian through the @xmath35 and @xmath36 gauss - hermite moments .",
    "we observed an anti - correlation between @xmath35 and @xmath33 , and slight peak in @xmath36 at the center from the large - scale data .    combining the kinematics with the luminosity density measured from a _ hst _",
    "wfpc2 f791w image and a cfht wircam @xmath188 image , we constructed three - integral , triaxial , schwarzschild models .",
    "the intrinsic shape of the galaxy is very round ( as round as the imaging observations allow ) , and oblate , with axis ratios @xmath189 and @xmath190 at a radius of 107 .",
    "although we are unable to place strong constraints on the shape parameters / viewing orientation , by sampling over them , we were able to extract a robust measurement of the black hole mass and @xmath1-band stellar mass - to - light ratio , finding @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "additional model grids were run to assess possible systematic effects .",
    "we tested the effect on the black hole mass when assigning all the light from the central mge component to the agn , incorporating a fixed dark halo model , excluding the central osiris kinematics that may be biased due to agn contamination , adopting two extreme models for the osiris psf , and symmetrizing the kinematic measurements .",
    "we did not see any significant changes ( outside of the modeling fitting uncertainties ) to the best - fit @xmath5 or @xmath57 .    with the stellar dynamical black hole mass measurement , ngc",
    "3998 is consistent with @xmath14 when using a bulge stellar velocity dispersion of @xmath193 km s@xmath11 , but well off the @xmath178 correlation , even when overestimating the bulge luminosity . also , the stellar dynamical black hole mass measurement is larger than the existing gas dynamical measurement , with the masses differing by close to a factor of four .",
    "ngc 3998 is now one of eight galaxies for which both stellar and gas dynamical modeling have been used to measure the mass of the central black hole .",
    "however , the gas kinematics turned out to be strongly disturbed in two of the galaxies and a clear best - fit mass and the associated uncertainties could not be measured for another object , preventing a meaningful comparison between the stellar and gas dynamical techniques .",
    "the five remaining comparison studies have produced mixed results , ranging from excellent agreement between the two mass measurements to the stellar dynamical black hole mass exceeding the gas dynamical determination by a factor of five .",
    "of the three cases in which the black hole masses disagree , the stellar dynamical measurement is always larger than the black hole mass derived with gas dynamical modeling .",
    "with such a limited sample , clearly more cross - checks are necessary before conclusions can be made regarding the consistency of the gas and stellar dynamical techniques , the subsequent effects on the @xmath5 @xmath4 host galaxy relationship , and the magnitude and distribution of the cosmic scatter in the correlations . targeting galaxies with dust lanes could be particularly useful , as well - ordered , symmetric dust lanes suggest the presence of a regularly rotating gas disk @xcite and can also be used to constrain galaxy inclinations .",
