    "the neutrinosphere density , @xmath3 , then follows from known cross sections for neutrinos with these energies .",

    "we will use these results in later works to calculate neutrino interactions .",
    "nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) models are commonly used in nuclear astrophysics  @xcite .",
    "these models describe low - density nuclear matter as a system of non- or minimally - interacting nuclei with a distribution of neutron number @xmath4 and charge @xmath5 determined from nuclear masses through statistical equilibrium .",
    "however , nse models fail in an uncontrollable manner as the density increases and strong interactions between nuclei become important .",
    "one would like a model - independent way to include strong interactions and a well - defined criterion to determine the range of validity of nse models . in this paper",
    "we take a step towards this goal by considering a simple nse model with neutrons ( @xmath6 ) , protons ( @xmath7 ) and alpha ( @xmath8 ) particles .",
    "the virial expansion is then used to systematically incorporate strong interactions using nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) , n@xmath8 and @xmath9 elastic scattering phase shifts .    pure neutron matter at low density is a very interesting nearly - universal fermi system . in the limit that the neutron - neutron scattering length is large compared to the interparticle spacing and",
    "the range of the interaction is small , the properties of dilute fermi gases are expected to be universal , independent of the details of the interaction . in a separate paper  @xcite , we have calculated the equation of state of low - density neutron matter using the virial expansion , in order to assess quantitatively how close the system is to universal behavior at finite temperature .",

    "there are many theoretical approaches to low - density nuclear matter .",
    "microscopic calculations start from nn and three - nucleon interactions that reproduce nn scattering and selected few - nucleon data .",
    "in addition to the conventional variational  @xcite and brueckner  @xcite calculations , renormalization - group methods coupled with effective field theory provide new insights to nuclear forces and the possibility of a perturbative and thus systematic approach to nuclear matter with theoretical error estimates  @xcite .",
    "however , all wave functions that are typically used only include two - nucleon correlations and omit four - nucleon correlations that could be important to describe alpha particle formation at low densities .",
    "we note that the equation of state calculation of buchler and coon  @xcite is close in strategy to the virial equation of state , but it takes into account pauli blocking on the phase shifts and thus uses a model nn interaction .",
    "moreover , there are a variety of skyrme - type  @xcite and relativistic mean - field  @xcite parametrizations of the nuclear energy functional , which are used to calculate ground - state energies and densities of intermediate - mass and heavy nuclei .",
    "however , it is not clear what form to take for the energy functional for a gas of nucleons at low densities , where the system forms clusters and the binding energy per nucleon is density - independent with @xmath10 .",
    "there are also some phenomenological models that attempt to provide a reasonable behavior for the equation of state over a wide range of densities , temperatures and compositions .",
    "the lattimer - swesty equation of state  @xcite is based on an extended liquid - drop model .",
    "this equation of state is almost universally used in modern supernova simulations  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the shen - toki - oyamatsu - sumiyoshi equation of state  @xcite is based on an approximate thomas - fermi calculation using a relativistic mean - field interaction . however , it is not clear how reliable these models are , and there does not appear to be any way to systematically improve them .    recently , there are lattice simulations for neutron matter using effective field theory  @xcite , where the couplings are fitted to reproduce nn scattering regularized on the same lattice .",
    "these calculations are promising , but are presently limited to low orders in the effective field theory expansion and to small lattices .",
    "it is very useful to compare these lattice results to our virial equation of state at low densities . in the virial approach it is simple to assess how errors in the nn phase shifts , because of a low - order truncation in the effective field theory , impact the equation of state .",
    "the virial equation of state thus provides a valuable check for the lattice results .",
    "the virial expansion is a very general and old method for determining the equation of state of a dilute gas .",
    "there are two major assumptions .",
    "first , that the system is in a gas phase and has undergone no phase transition with decreasing temperature or increasing density .",
    "second , that the fugacity @xmath11 is small , so the partition function can be expanded in powers of @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 denotes the chemical potential and @xmath14 is the temperature .",
    "the second virial coefficient @xmath15 describes the @xmath16 term in the fugacity expansion of the partition function , while the third virial coefficient describes the @xmath17 term . a general formula relating @xmath15 to the two - body elastic scattering phase shifts has been known for some time  @xcite .",
    "little is known about the third virial coefficient  @xcite .",
    "the first application of the virial expansion to hot matter formed in heavy - ion experiments was by pratt _",
    "et al . _",
    "in addition , venugopalan and prakash  @xcite , for example , use the virial expansion to study matter formed in relativistic heavy - ion collisions . in general , however , the latter work is interested in much higher temperatures , where thermal mesons are important .",
    "a great advantage of the virial expansion is that it correctly includes both bound states and scattering resonances on an equal footing .",
    "in contrast , nse models only include bound state contributions . since the thermodynamics of the system is continuous when a bound state moves into the resonant continuum , both weakly bound states and low - energy scattering resonances are equally important .",
    "this was explicitly demonstrated for fermi gases in the crossover region of a feshbach resonance by ho and mueller  @xcite .",
    "the virial expansion in this paper includes contributions from the two - nucleon ( deuteron ) and four - nucleon ( alpha particle ) bound states and the relevant low - energy scattering resonances : the dominant ones being the @xmath18s@xmath19 two - nucleon resonance ( @xmath20he or @xmath20n ) , the p@xmath21 n@xmath8 resonance and the @xmath9 @xmath22 resonance that is the ground state of @xmath23be .",

    "results are presented in section  [ results ] for the virial coefficients and equilibrium properties , such as the composition , pressure , entropy , energy and symmetry energy .",
    "we conclude and give an outlook in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "in this section , we introduce the virial expansion for a system of neutrons , protons , and alpha particles . we first discuss our choice of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 particle degrees of freedom",
    ". then we present the virial equation of state expanded to second order in the fugacities and calculate the entropy and the energy .",
    "finally , we relate the second virial coefficients to the relevant scattering phase shifts .      there is a close relation between the virial expansion and nse models .",
    "the latter include a variety of bound states , while the virial expansion includes both bound states and scattering resonances .",
    "the virial equation of state can therefore also be regarded as a systematic extension of nse models to take into account strong interactions in the resonant continuum .",
    "the deuteron is automatically included in the virial expansion as a bound - state contribution to the second virial coefficient @xmath24 with experimental deuteron binding energy @xmath25 .",
    "however , the @xmath8 particle has a large binding energy , @xmath26 , and this will only be included in the fourth virial coefficient describing four - nucleon interactions . in general ,",
    "fourth - order contributions are expected to be small at low densities and high temperatures .",
    "however , for lower temperatures @xmath27 is very large .",
    "this will lead to an unnaturally large fourth virial coefficient that will greatly reduce the radius of convergence of the nucleonic virial expansion .",
    "our solution to this problem is to rearrange the original nucleonic virial expansion and include @xmath8 particles explicitly .",
    "this allows us to retain the large @xmath27 terms at lower order in the virial expansion .",
    "this procedure can be extended to explicitly include a variety of additional heavy nuclei that may be important at even higher densities .",

    ", @xmath140 rises rapidly at low densities where the virial coefficients make only small contributions .",
    "therefore the error band is very small .",
    "the error band becomes more important for @xmath160 .",
    "the ls equation of state is seen to significantly underestimate @xmath140 at all three temperatures .",
    "this may be due to a simple oversight in the published version  @xcite of the ls equation of state .",
    "lattimer and swesty include the neutron - proton mass difference in the proton chemical potential , but do not appear to include twice this difference in the alpha chemical potential .",
    "in contrast , the shen equation of state is close to our virial results at low densities .",
    "however , both ls and shen equations of state predict too few @xmath8 particles at high temperatures @xmath161 .",

    "the differences of the ls and shen equations of state at the higher densities shown for @xmath162 in fig .",

    "[ fig7 ]    [ fig8 ]    both phenomenological equations of state shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] give @xmath8 particle concentrations that first increase with density and then rapidly decrease .",
    "this decrease is due to the formation of heavy nuclei .",
    "heavy nuclei are not included in our first studies .",
    "we will extend the virial formalism to include heavy nuclei in future work .",
    "therefore , our virial results are currently limited to lower densities , where one does not expect large contributions from heavy nuclei . in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , we plot the density above which the shen equation of state has a heavy nuclei mass fraction larger than 10% .",
    "this provides an estimate for the range of validity of the virial @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 equation of state . for this estimate",
    "we have considered the shen instead of the ls model due to the ls error in @xmath140 .",
    "next , we present our results for the pressure . in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , we plot the pressure of symmetric nuclear matter for @xmath163 .",
    "the formation of @xmath8 particles reduces the total number of particles in the system , and this significantly lowers the pressure . for comparison",
    ", we also show in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] the microscopic fermi hyper - netted - chain ( fhnc ) equation of state of friedman and pandharipande  @xcite .",
    "the latter calculation is based on a variational wave function with only two - nucleon correlations .",
    "however , the model - independent virial equation of state shows that there are large @xmath8 concentrations in this density regime .",
    "for example , at the threshold density of @xmath164 ( from fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) we have @xmath165 .",
    "microscopic calculations may require wave functions with four - nucleon correlations to accurately describe these @xmath8 particle contributions .",
    "_ this suggests that all present microscopic variational or brueckner equations of state are incomplete in their description of low - density nuclear matter . _ in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , we also give the pressure for densities beyond the threshold density of fig .  [ fig9 ] in order to compare virial and fhnc results , which both omit the formation of heavy nuclei .    the error band in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] is again estimated from a neglected third virial coefficient @xmath166 .",
    "for the pressure , this involves a cancellation .",
    "increasing @xmath149 decreases the nucleonic contribution to the pressure due to the additional attractive interaction between nucleons .",
    "however , a larger @xmath149 also reduces the formation of @xmath8 particles ( due to a lower alpha chemical potential ) , and this acts to increase the total pressure .",
    "therefore , a positive @xmath149 reduces the pressure at very low densities , but then leads to a larger pressure with increasing density .    in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , we show our results for the pressure of symmetric nuclear matter for @xmath71 in comparison to the phenomenological ls and shen equations of state .",
    "the pressure given in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] also includes the contribution of an electron and photon gas as in appendix  c of  @xcite .",
    "we find the pressures given by the virial equation of state and the phenomenological models agree well .    in a separate paper  @xcite",
    ", we have demonstrated that the equation of state of low - density neutron matter scales to a very good approximation .",
    "table  [ table1 ] shows that the neutron virial coefficient @xmath122 is practically independent of the temperature .",
    "if all virial coefficients are temperature independent , and provided the condition for chemical equilibrium does not introduce a strong temperature dependence through @xmath167 , then the power series in the fugacity for the pressure and the baryon density will have no explicit temperature dependence . in this case , the pressure will scale as @xmath168 where @xmath169 is some function of @xmath170 .",
    "if this scaling relation holds , one can predict the pressure @xmath171 at a new temperature @xmath172 from the original @xmath173 through @xmath174 with @xmath175 .",
    "we study this scaling symmetry in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] , where we have used eq .",
    "( [ pscale ] ) to predict the pressure of neutron matter for @xmath176 from virial pressures calculated for @xmath101 and @xmath158 .",
    "the agreement with the unscaled @xmath71 virial pressure is excellent .",
    "this demonstrates that low - density neutron matter scales , even when interactions are included .",
    "[ fig12 ] also shows scaled pressures of symmetric nuclear matter for @xmath176 using @xmath101 and @xmath158 results as input .",
    "these scaled pressures do not agree with the @xmath71 virial pressure .",
    "therefore , nuclear matter does not scale , which is due to clustering and mainly comes as a result of the strong temperature dependence of @xmath37 and @xmath140 .",
    "the entropy per baryon @xmath134 of symmetric nuclear matter is shown for @xmath71 in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] .",
    "here , our virial calculation again includes the entropy of an electron and photon gas as in appendix  c of  @xcite . the entropy is clearly seen to reflect the composition . at low densities , the ls entropy is above the other calculations because of the low @xmath8 mass fraction in the ls model . at high densities ,",
    "the entropy in the phenomenological models is below our virial result due to the formation of heavy nuclei .",
    "this deviation coincides with the threshold density of fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] , we also show the entropy per baryon for the wolff equation of state  @xcite , to give a measure for the model dependence of the onset of heavy nuclei . the entropy per baryon for extremely neutron - rich matter @xmath177 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] .",
    "now there is very little change in composition , and thus good agreement between the virial and phenomenological results .",
    "in addition to the entropy , we show our results for the energy per baryon @xmath135 in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] . in the limit of very low density",
    ", the energy reduces to the kinetic energy of an ideal classical gas @xmath178 .",
    "therefore , we have subtracted @xmath178 from @xmath135 in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] , in order to clearly show the interaction effects .",
    "we find that the energy per baryon for pure neutron matter is somewhat below @xmath178 due to the attractive nuclear interactions .",
    "our neutron matter results are in excellent agreement with the scaling law for the energy density @xmath179 , which follows from eq .",
    "( [ epsilon ] ) when the virial coefficients are temperature independent , as is the case for neutron matter with @xmath180 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath135 for symmetric nuclear matter drops very rapidly with increasing density .",
    "this reflects the large binding energy as @xmath8 particles form . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] , this drop becomes more rapid for lower temperatures .",
    "we therefore expect that the inclusion of heavy nuclei , or many - nucleon correlations , are necessary to obtain a constant energy per particle @xmath181 for @xmath113 nuclear matter at subsaturation densities .",
    "the symmetry energy @xmath182 characterizes how the energy rises as one moves away from equal numbers of neutrons and protons , @xmath183 we evaluate the second derivative of the energy per baryon with respect to the proton fraction numerically . fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] shows the symmetry energy for @xmath71 . at very low density , @xmath182 rises slowly with density .",
    "to lowest order in the density and neglecting @xmath8 particles , the symmetry energy is given by @xmath184 then , as @xmath8 particles form , @xmath182 rises much faster with density . as a result of clustering ,",
    "the symmetry energy is large even at a very small fraction of saturation density .",
    "this is analogous to the observed behavior for the energy .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] the symmetry free energy @xmath185 defined as @xmath186 to lowest order in the density and neglecting @xmath8 particles , the symmetry free energy is given by @xmath187 where the @xmath188 term is from the entropy of mixing in the free energy density .",
    "again , as @xmath8 particles form , we find in fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] that @xmath185 increases rapidly with density .",
    "finally , the temperature dependence of the symmetry energy is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] for @xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "the lower the temperature , the more rapidly @xmath182 rises with density .",
    "we conclude that , in the thermodynamic limit , the symmetry energy is large at low densities due to cluster formation .",
    "isospin observables in asymmetric heavy - ion collisions , such as the @xmath189 ration of emitted fragments , are often analyzed with semiclassical simulations , where nucleons move in isospin - dependent mean fields and undergo two - nucleon collisions .",
    "the isospin - dependent mean - field implies a certain symmetry energy .",
    "the density dependence of this symmetry energy can be adjusted to improve agreement with the data , e.g. , see  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenological symmetry energy at low densities is in general much smaller than our virial @xmath182 .",
    "this is because the symmetry energy in the virial expansion includes the contributions of clusters with high central densities even at low baryon density .",
    "the relation between @xmath182 and the symmetry energy of mean - field models for single nuclei should therefore be investigated in future work .",
    "we have presented the equation of state of low - density nuclear matter using the model - independent virial expansion .",
    "the virial equation of state is thermodynamically consistent and was calculated directly from binding energies and scattering phase shifts , without the need of a nuclear interaction model or nuclear wave functions .",
    "therefore , our results provide a benchmark for all microscopic or phenomenological equations of state at low densities .",
    "the virial equation of state can also be used to constrain models that extend to higher densities . in some cases ,",
    "our virial results may be used to constrain model parameters or functional forms for model interactions . in other cases",
    ", more extensive modifications of the phenomenological equations of state may be necessary in order to reproduce the virial low - density limit .",
    "tightly bound nuclei can lead to unnaturally large bound state contributions to the higher - order virial coefficients .",
    "therefore , we have considered a gas of nucleons and alpha particles to explicitly take into account the large @xmath8 particle binding energy .",
    "this leads to a larger radius of convergence compared to a nucleonic virial expansion .",
    "we have calculated the second virial coefficients for nn , n@xmath8 and @xmath9 interactions directly from the relevant binding energies and scattering phase shifts . for the temperatures of interest ,",
    "the virial coefficients are dominated by the low - energy bound states and resonances , but higher partial wave contributions are significant .",
    "we have found that the second virial coefficient for neutron matter @xmath60 is approximately temperature - independent , which leads to an approximate scaling symmetry of pure neutron matter .",
    "the second virial coefficients for nuclear matter @xmath107 and @xmath106 decrease with temperature , and as a result nuclear matter does not scale . the second virial coefficient for n@xmath8 interactions @xmath190",
    "is well approximated by the resonant p@xmath21 contribution .",
    "this holds over a wide range of energies due to a cancellation among the additional partial waves . the second virial coefficient for @xmath9 interactions @xmath62 increases with temperature , as the @xmath9 phase shifts become large at higher energies .",
    "the inclusion of the coulomb interaction for the virial coefficients , and the proper treatment of inelasticities and mixing parameters ( due to the tensor force ) are important topics for future improvements .",
    "we have used the virial coefficients to make model - independent predictions for a variety of properties of nuclear matter over a range of densities , temperatures and composition .",
    "the resulting @xmath8 particle concentration disagrees with all equations of state currently used in supernova simulations .",
    "the contributions from low - energy resonances show most prominently in the composition of low - density nuclear matter .",
    "the effects of the second virial coefficients follows a natural hierarchy , with the nn virial coefficients being more important than the n@xmath8 virial coefficient , and the @xmath9 virial coefficient leading to very small changes .",
    "we have used this hierarchy to make simple error estimates by studying the effects of a neglected third virial coefficient @xmath191 .",
    "the resulting error bands are small .",
    "detailed investigations of the effects of omitted higher virial coefficients , as well as the effects of heavy nuclei will be the topic of separate studies .",
    "for a better error estimate , it is important to also have a reliable calculation of the third virial coefficients , which could , e.g. , come from a calculation in the effective field theory for halo nuclei  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these error estimates can also help clarify the domain of validity of the virial expansion .",
    "the physics of nuclear matter is very different from neutron matter due to clustering . as the density increases , @xmath8 particles form and this leads to a significant reduction of the pressure of low - density nuclear matter .",
    "similarly , clustering increases the binding energy and it reduces the entropy , which reflects the number of particles in the system . as the density increases further , heavier nuclei and larger clusters form , and @xmath8 particles become less important . in fact , the breakdown of the virial expansion for nuclear matter is due to the formation of heavy nuclei , which is reached before the nucleon fugacities become large . in nuclear matter at @xmath113 , we expect that one has to explicitly include heavy nuclei , or many - nucleon correlations , to obtain a constant energy per baryon @xmath10 and a constant symmetry energy at low densities .",
    "these virial results greatly improve our conceptual understanding of nuclear matter at subsaturation densities .",
    "the virial equation of state can be regarded as a systematic extension of nse models for strong interactions in the resonant continuum .",
    "such a comparison will also provide valuable insights how to systematically organize the virial expansion to include heavy nuclei .",
    "in addition , topics of future studies include model - independent predictions for the neutrino response of low - density nuclear matter and a detailed comparison with nuclear lattice calculations  @xcite .",
