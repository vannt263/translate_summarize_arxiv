    "particles suspended in fluid move along random trajectories .",
    "study on so called the brownian motion has provided fundamental understanding of macroscopic diffusion phenomena led by collective dynamics of microscopic constituents . theoretical framework to describe the brownian motion was proposed by einstein  @xcite , which is experimentally verified by perrin  @xcite .",
    "the brownian trajectories reflect medium properties , shape and size of particles .",
    "hence , analyzing diffusive motions is a useful way to examine the physical properties of solution and colloid suspension , and its applications extend to the realm of chemistry and biology , let alone physics  @xcite .",
    "although the original theory by einstein describes translational motion in terms of diffusion constants , theory was extended to rotational motion of an ellipsoid  @xcite , and an object with shape anisotropy has acquired considerable attention over decades for both in free space @xcite and under an external potential field @xcite . there",
    "exist abundant examples of anisotropic objects such as proteins and microtubles in nature , man - made colloidal particles  @xcite , and nanotubes  @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention a few diffusion characteristics of anisotropic particles .",
    "since object more easily diffuses in the direction of its major principal axis , trajectory of an anisotropic particle becomes elongated along the preferred direction  @xcite .",
    "this asymmetric trajectories in turn allow us infer the shape of a particle , but it can only be observable within time interval while orientation of the particle is preserved .",
    "also , the statistics of diffusion trajectory is not gaussian having higher order cumulants which contain the information associated with shape  @xcite .",
    "it is only recent that these features could be experimentally characterized  @xcite .",
    "the state of art experiment was enabled by single particle tracking technique  @xcite , and demonstrates a potential possibility to acquire shape information from diffusion trajectories . yet",
    ", the practical application is limited by a few factors .",
    "first is to realize high temporal resolution .",
    "if time resolution is longer than orientation correlation time , diffusion trajectory becomes indiscernible from that of spherical or point particles in the laboratory frame , and information related to shape anisotropy is totally erased .",
    "this issue would be partially solved by recent developments to enhance the resolution less than orientational correlation time of membrane proteins of cells , which is typically order of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "more crucial is the fact that it is experimentally infeasible to identify initial angles of nanoscale objects , and one has to consider averaged quantity over an ensemble of randomly oriented particles . in conventionally used second cumulant of displacement ,",
    "terms associated with shape anisotropy vanish upon averaging over randomly distributed initial angles .",
    "we thus needs to consider higher orders as relevant quantities to the trajectory analysis in relation to the shape factor  @xcite . since statistical convergences of higher order cumulants",
    "are usually poor , their statistical behaviors and errors are still to be examined . furthermore , natural question arises : what is the best higher order quantity to pursue efficient and reliable estimation of diffusion constants and shape anisotropy ?",
    "the purpose of this study is to propose a new measure , based on the gyration tensor , and suggest a systematic way to read diffusion constants of anisotropic objects from particle position trajectories . considering motions of anisotropic objects moving on a two dimensional space in the absence of external force ,",
    "we analyze the fourth order fluctuation of particle displacement both analytically and numerically by langevin dynamics simulation .",
    "in particular , we obtain the analytic expression of the gyration measure , which completely agrees with langevin dynamics simulation results .",
    "we compare the statistical convergence and finite sampling error of the gyration measure with previously suggested fourth moments and find that analysis adopting gyration tensor is most efficient .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce our system and its governing equations of motion , where we illustrate an example of the diffusive trajectory , and discuss the properties of the second cumulant of particle position .",
    "the higher order quantities are examined in sec .",
    "iii , where we introduce the fourth order quantity obtained from the gyration tensor and obtain its analytic expression exactly . in order to test the efficiency of those measures ,",
    "we evaluate the standard errors of the fourth cumulants and the gyration tensor based measure and explicate their errors in the estimation of diffusion constants in sec.iv . finally in sec .",
    "v , we discuss a possible scheme to implement least error measure and the properties of other fourth order measures .",

    "the second moment describes well the normal diffusion and the position dispersion is perfectly symmetric , as indicated by the aspect ratio , @xmath36 .",
    "for @xmath37 , the diffusive behavior in the long time limit ( @xmath38 ) is similar to the normal diffusion with diffusion constant @xmath39 , and the aspect ratio of trajectories is almost unity . if observation time is short compared to the angular relaxation time ( @xmath40 ) , the diffusion follows the behavior , @xmath41 , dependent on the anisotropy factor @xmath27 and the initial angle , and leads to the aspect ratio deviated from unity .",
    "in order to read @xmath27 and @xmath19 from the second moment given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : xsecondm ] ) , one needs to realize an ensemble of particles at a fixed initial angle , which can possibly be done if one detects the initial angles of particles , and collect a number of trajectories of particles which have the identical initial orientation .",
    "however , it is difficult to resolve the orientations of microscopic objects in single particle tracking experiment  @xcite so that experimentally available are quantities averaged over randomly distributed initial angles .",
    "meanwhile as is apparent from eq .",
    "( [ eq : xsecondm ] ) the average of the second moment over initial angle @xmath11 nullifies the second term containing factors @xmath27 and @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , it is necessary in most practical situations to examine higher moments in order to obtain the physical constants of objects from the initial angle averaged trajectories . to the end , the authors of ref .",

    "there certainly exist alternative ways to measure fluctuations in quartic order of the stochastic variable .",
    "for example , one can consider the fourth moment of translocation , @xmath44 .",
    "following the calculation scheme in appendix a , we find , @xmath45 subtracting the first term given from the second moment of @xmath46 leads to a measure , @xmath47:@xmath48 for short time measurements @xmath49 , @xmath50 increase quadratically in time and in the long time measurement @xmath51 , it converges to linear function of time .",
    "such asymptotic behaviors are determined by @xmath27 and @xmath19 .",
    "this is also the case for @xmath52 because of a relation @xmath53 .",
    "another fourth moment measure is gyration tensor , which is useful in identifying the spatial distribution of particles @xcite .",

    "are displayed in fig .  2 , where we compare numerical results obtained from langevin dynamics simulation with the analytic results .",
    "it can be seen that the two methods yield consistent results .",
    "this consistency could be obtained only for sufficient repetitions of simulation ( @xmath67 simulations were performed in producing fig .  2 ) .",
    "if the number of repeated simulations ( or experiments ) is insufficient , the estimate of @xmath86 would be randomly deviated from the analytic results .",
    "therefore , in practical estimation of the diffusion constants from a finite number of measurements , the statistical convergence of the measures and also finite sampling errors in estimating the diffusion constants come into question .     before proceeding , let us make a remark on the effect of a marker position . in single particle tracking experiments diffusion trajectory of an object",
    "is obtained by tracing a point - like marker allocated on the object . in our consideration , the marker is assumed to be placed at the center of mobility . even if the marker position is displaced from the center by @xmath87",

    "one thus finds that this correction would be negligible when when @xmath89 with @xmath90 the size of the elongated object .",
    "in order to investigate the statistical convergence , we consider the variance of the measures , @xmath91 although it is the very basic idea of statistics , we briefly mention the statistical meaning of @xmath92 .",
    "suppose that one has a data set of @xmath93 s with @xmath93 obtained from the @xmath56th measurement ( or simulation ) , and the total number of data , @xmath94 , is relatively large so that one can apply the central limit theorem .",
    "then , the bias of the finite sampling average @xmath95 from the true average @xmath96 can be written as @xmath97 from the above equation we find that the number of samplings required to reach the desired accuracy , @xmath98 , amounts to @xmath99 therefore , @xmath92 in relative to the average @xmath96 quantifies the finite sampling error and also required number of measurements .    ) , of the quartic order measures for various @xmath100 values as a function of @xmath101 , where the average is taken over @xmath67 simulations .",

    "the fluctuations for @xmath107 are more significant than @xmath80 for a given @xmath100 , and for a given measure , it is more pronounced for smaller @xmath100 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : errandbehavior ] , we present the relative fluctuation , @xmath108 , as a function of observation time . we observe that it increases linearly in time , and",

    "we also perform the detailed analysis of statistical errors of the gyration measure which indeed confirms eq .",
    "( [ behavior ] ) and allows us to analytically evaluate @xmath105 and @xmath103 . over the entire range of observation time , @xmath108 for @xmath111 is bigger than that for the gyration measure @xmath112 .",
    "moreover , @xmath107 increases more rapidly than @xmath80 , and its statistical convergence in the long time limit should be much poorer than @xmath80 .",
    "this observation together with eqs .",
    "( [ standard error ] ) and ( [ sample number ] ) implies that if one choose to use @xmath107 rather than the gyration measure , estimation of @xmath27 and @xmath19 according to the limiting behaviors eq .",
    "( [ eq : longshort ] ) from finite number of experiments can be more errorneous , and requires more samplings . in this respect",
    "it appears that more efficient analysis can be done by the gyration measure .",
    "however , because of @xmath113 linearly increasing in time , in using the gyration measure it is desirable to choose the observation time window , @xmath114 where @xmath115 is large for the long time behavior to set in , and yet not too large to bring in unwanted fluctuations . it should also be noted that the relative fluctuation becomes more significant if we consider less anisotropic particles ( smaller @xmath100 ) .",
    "note also in appendix c that the magnitude of @xmath105 and @xmath103 are enhanced as @xmath100 decrease .",
    "this is because for small @xmath27 the measure itself becomes small , while @xmath116 remains finite .",
    "therefore , it is expected that a large number of experiments should be repeated in order to probe weak anisotropy .",
    "let us now demonstrate more explicitly how the discussed behaviors of the variance are reflected in the estimation of diffusion constants .",
    "we evaluate finite sampling errors in @xmath27 and @xmath19 , and present the results in fig .  4 , where @xmath117 and @xmath118 represent values extracted from finite sample average of @xmath86 of sample size @xmath94 , @xmath119 , with @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",

    "although the error is large , it is order of magnitude less than the case of @xmath107 , and more importantly , it can further be reduced by increasing the sample size , as suggested in the bias well saturated into @xmath125 .     and",
    "@xmath118 are the estimated values from measuring the asymptotic behaviors of @xmath119 .",
    "the upper panel shows the bias of @xmath117 from its true value @xmath27 .",
    "both @xmath107 and @xmath80 result in the bias decreasing with the sample size ( @xmath125 lines are added for guides to the eye ) , but the bias is larger for @xmath107 in the entire range of sample size . in determining @xmath118 , we evaluate the slope of @xmath119 at @xmath129 .",
