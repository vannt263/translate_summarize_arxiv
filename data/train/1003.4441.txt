    "the hydrodynamics of fish locomotion at moderate reynolds number has been of interest to biologists and engineers for decades .",
    "it is known that unsteady rhythmic undulations of fish ` control surfaces '  the body , fins and tail  play a fundamental role in enabling a fish to propel itself through the water @xcite .",
    "this propulsion is achieved primarily by the reaction force supplied by the fluid against the accelerating and deforming surfaces .",
    "theoretical models for fish swimming have been proposed by @xcite and @xcite , which utilize slender body theory to explain thrust generation in fish - like swimming .",
    "more recently , it has been found that the mechanism of vorticity shedding off the fins and tail is an important feature in fish locomotion @xcite .",
    "the near - field flow structure , wake structure and body vortices around the fish skin have been studied both experimentally and computationally @xcite .",
    "moreover , triantafyllou and co - workers @xcite have investigated the range of strouhal number in flapping foils and fish - like systems that lead to peak propulsive efficiency .",
    "propulsive efficiency is defined as @xmath0 in triantafyllou s paper , where @xmath1 is the time - averaged thrust , @xmath2 is the average forward velocity , and @xmath3 is the average input power . in their work , the range @xmath4 usually guarantees the highest propulsive efficiencies .",
    "this strouhal number range is also seen in aquatic creatures , such as sharks and cetaceans @xcite .    however , these studies are all based on individual fish . indeed",
    ", many kinds of fishes tend to swim in groups @xcite .",
    "a number of explanations for fish schooling have been advanced , for example , protection against predation @xcite , social animal behaviors @xcite , and reduction of navigation errors @xcite . in particular",
    ", it is thought that energy savings through hydrodynamic interactions could be an important factor .",
    "@xcite postulated that the hydrodynamics of fish schooling is strongly tied with both streamwise and lateral interactions among the fish , and proposed an optimal configuration in which members would draw the most energetic benefit .",
    "though there has been some skepticism about the relative importance of achieving hydrodynamic benefit in schooling @xcite , it is reasonable to expect that some benefit is achieved , even after the necessary compromises that detract from energy savings to fulfill the other roles of the school @xcite .",
    "@xcite have found evidence of energy savings by comparing oxygen consumption rates and tail - beat frequencies between members at the front and rear of the school .",
    "more recently , @xcite examined cetacean mother ",
    "calf pairs swimming in echelon formation and found that the calf was able to reduce its effort and increase its speed compared to solo swimming .",
    "in contrast to the extensive investigations on self - propulsion mechanisms for individual fish - like swimming , there have been relatively few studies  either computational or experimental  on the hydromechanical consequences of fish schooling .",
    "studies on streamwise interactions have recently been performed in the context of fish swimming in an obstacle wake @xcite .",
    "@xcite computationally studied the passive self - propulsion of a three - link fish - like swimmer by focusing on the effect of the body length and flexibility of the fish .",
    "however , lateral interactions among fish - like bodies with undulatory waves propagating from the head to the tail have not been explored thoroughly .",
    "a notable exception is the recent computational study of @xcite , in which an infinite lateral series of two - dimensional undulating fish - like shapes was investigated .",
    "each member of the series moved either in phase or exactly out of phase with its immediate neighbors .",
    "they found that the anti - phase cases led to maximum thrust generation , while in - phase cases exhibited the greatest energy savings .",
    "they found that benefits were insignificant for separation distances beyond one body length .",
    "similar to the study of @xcite , the present paper focuses on the hydrodynamics of two - dimensional fish - like shapes in lateral arrangement , undergoing undulatory motions in a viscous and incompressible flow .",
    "however , in contrast to their work , the present investigation focuses on the thrust consequences in configurations with a finite number of individuals , over a wider range of separation distances and a variety of phase differences .",
    "the study relies on numerical simulations of the navier  stokes equations with the viscous vortex particle method @xcite .",
    "single and multiple ( up to three ) fish tethered in a free - stream flow are simulated in this work .",
    "the reynolds number  the ratio of inertial to viscous forces  is maintained relatively low at 100 for computational benefits .",
    "however , the results can be extended to higher reynolds number , since the reactive mechanisms at the heart of the interaction are insensitive to this parameter .",
    "the strouhal number , which represents the ratio of tail undulation velocity to free - stream velocity , is varied in a single fish to determine the value at which thrust balances drag .",
    "this strouhal number is then fixed in all lateral configurations of fish - like bodies .",
    "the hydrodynamics of lateral schooling of fish - like bodies is studied by varying the separation distance and phase difference between adjacent fishes .",
    "finally , a lateral configuration with three fishes is also investigated here .",
    "it is noted that , although this study is only focused on an abstracted model for fish - like swimming , the purpose of this study  to examine hydrodynamic interactions between nearby fish - like shapes and their effect on thrust  is also relevant for understanding similar mechanisms in real fish .",
    "furthermore , this study represents the first step in a logical sequence towards a more comprehensive understanding of hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "the present investigation makes use of the viscous vortex particle method @xcite to simulate the flow .",
    "this method solves the lagrangian form of the navier - stokes equations by utilizing vorticity - carrying particles as computational elements .",
    "the no - slip boundary condition is enforced by solving for and fluxing a surface vortex sheet representing spurious slip into adjacent particles in the fluid .",
    "the method was recently extended to continuously deforming bodies by @xcite .",
    "convergence of the overall algorithm to the navier - stokes solution was demonstrated in their work .",
    "the reliance on convecting computational particles rather than a grid affords this method with a natural adaptivity to the evolving shape of the fish .",
    "furthermore , there is no difficulty in simulating multiple fishes , even if separated by tens of body lengths .",
    "particles interact with each other through the biot - savart summation , which is accelerated by a fast multipole method @xcite .",
    "details of the vvpm including force calculation for deforming bodies , including convergence studies , can be found in the paper by @xcite .",

    "its construction , depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : fishdesign ] , is based on the time - varying shape of a backbone curve .",
    "several circles of different radius are centered on the backbone , and cubic splines are drawn between points of tangency on these circles to represent the fish profile .",

    "this form , which is motivated by the analysis of carangiform fish mechanics by @xcite , produces a traveling wave of growing amplitude that propagates from the head to the tail . by using this construction of a fish - like shape ,",
    "the fractional change of area is never greater than 0.2 percent , thus the body configuration can be regarded as area preserving .",
    "it is known that tail - beat frequency is a key parameter in the propulsion mechanism of fish @xcite .",
    "this effect is characterized in this work by the strouhal number , defined as @xmath11 , where @xmath9 is the backbone frequency , @xmath12 is the peak - to - peak tail amplitude , and @xmath13 is a free - stream velocity .",
    "the reynolds number , defined as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the horizontal chord length between the head and the tail ( approximately 1.1 in our fish ) and @xmath16 is the kinematic viscosity , is held fixed at @xmath17 .",
    "finally , it is conventional to represent the force by a dimensionless force coefficient the @xmath18 component of this force coefficient is defined as @xmath19 .",
    "this section presents the computational results of a single two - dimensional fish - like shape as well as two and three fish - like profiles in lateral arrangement . for simplicity",
    ", we denote this single fish - like shape as a single ` fish ' and the system with two and three fish - like bodies as ` fish schooling ' .",
    "the first problem consists of performing a study to understand the effect of strouhal number on thrust generation in a fixed solo fish which is undergoing prescribed undulatory deformation in a uniform free stream .",
    "the second problem comprises an investigation of the thrust improvement mechanism in the lateral configuration of two and three fish schooling with respect to changes in separation distance and phase .      in order to understand mechanisms for thrust augmentation in fish schooling ,",
    "we firstly explore the two - dimensional flow and the resulting force produced by an undulating fish - like profile immersed in a uniform free stream .",
    "the strouhal number is varied over a range of values between 0.2 and 1 .",
    "[ fig : solofish_cx_st ] reveals a smoothly declining trend of the mean @xmath18 component of the force coefficient @xmath20 as strouhal number increases .",
    "in particular , it is noted that @xmath21 gives nearly zero mean net force and above this strouhal number , the fish generates a net thrust .",
    "thus , @xmath21 indicates the condition at which thrust balances drag in the mean sense , and the equivalent free - swimming fish would generate nearly the same flow .",
    "an example of the time - varying history of force coefficient is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : solofish_cx_t ] for @xmath21 .",
    "consequently , in the following cases of lateral arrangements of two and three fish schooling , strouhal number remains fixed at @xmath21 to demonstrate thrust improvement mechanisms induced by schooling configurations .",
    "it is useful to compare this strouhal number with those found in previous studies of aquatic creatures . in our study ,",
    "strouhal numbers greater than 0.8 are needed to produce net thrust , which is higher than those found in the studies of triantafyllou and co - workers @xcite .",
    "this can be mainly attributed to the low reynolds number ( @xmath22 ) used in our study , while trianatafyllou s papers are focused on high reynolds numbers of and above order @xmath23 . in order to achieve the same thrust",
    ", low reynolds number needs to be coupled with high strouhal number due to the increased role of viscous drag .",
    "most studies in fish locomotion are based on high reynolds number which are typical of aquatic animals , such as dolphins , but low reynolds number is still widely seen in swimming creatures with smaller size , for example , tadpole larvae swimming is at reynolds number on the order of @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "in addition , spanwise vorticity shedding and other three - dimensional effects , which are missed here , also affect the thrust generation mechanism .",
    "in this section , we apply the same two - dimensional fish - like profile utilized in the previous solo fish study in lateral arrangements of two fishes , and simulate two classes of cases which both have fixed strouhal number @xmath21 and reynolds number @xmath17 .",
    "the first class has fixed phase difference , which is set to be @xmath25 , but different separation distance @xmath26 defined as the distance between geometrical centroids on the upper and lower fish , @xmath27 .",
    "the other class has fixed separation distance @xmath28 , but different phase difference , @xmath29 .",
    "both cases are compared with the solo fish , which has the same periodically undulating deformation immersed in the unit free stream .",
    "the schematic of lateral configuration is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fishsketchmap ] for three fishes ; the two - fish configuration is similar .",
    "the effects of separation distance @xmath26 are explored by fixing the phase difference @xmath30 equal to @xmath31 , which corresponds to a mirroring between the upper and lower fish .",
    "[ fig : fishshapechange ] presents the shape variation for this symmetrical configuration in one whole period .",
    "the symmetry ensures that both fishes experience identical force in the @xmath18 direction .",
    "the relationships of the @xmath18 component of the mean force coefficient @xmath20 , and the individual contributions of pressure and viscous forces , with separation distance @xmath26 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2fish_phi1p0pi_cx_dy ] .",
    "the overall thrust decreases monotonically , but in a complex manner , as distance is increased .",
    "in other words , as separation distance decreases in this symmetrical arrangement , each fish gains more benefit from the other s presence .",
    "this benefit is achieved even at large distances , up to around 10 body lengths .",
    "this is significantly farther than found by @xcite , who only saw thrust influence up to around a single body length .",
    "however , that study focused on an infinite lateral array of fish and at a higher reynolds number ( 5000 ) , both of which might affect the interaction distance .",
    "when @xmath26 is less than @xmath32 , the total force coefficient reveals a nearly linear trend with respect to the separation distance @xmath26 . beyond @xmath33 ,",
    "the trend becomes more complicated and the force finally approaches to the asymptotic value @xmath34 , which is the mean net force in the solo fish .",
    "thus , as expected , the interaction between upper and lower fish is reduced to zero as separation increases .",
    "it should be noted that the thrust improvement is only shown here in the time - averaged sense .",
    "when total force is decomposed into the pressure and viscous force , the pressure force coefficient shows a relatively simpler trend which smoothly increases , while the viscous force coefficient demonstrates a complex trend which is similar to the total force coefficient .    in order to further understand the thrust improvement mechanisms achieved in lateral double fish schooling , we construct a control volume which follows the bottom surface of the upper fish and the top surface of the lower fish , then closes with two lateral lines from head - to - head and tail - to - tail , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : controlv ] .",
    "the net increase of @xmath18-momentum flux through the control volume is given in a time - averaged sense by @xmath35 where density of the fluid @xmath36 is set to be unity , and @xmath37 is the mean force acting on the inner surfaces of the fish .",
    "since the force on the outer portions of the fish are likely less affected by the other fish , changes in thrust would be determined mainly by changes in @xmath37 .",
    "table  [ tab : u2dy ] reveals that the difference of the time - averaged momentum flux normalized by separation distance between the entrance and the exit of the control volume , @xmath38 remains almost the same as @xmath26 is increased from @xmath39 to @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the nearly linear increase of @xmath20 with @xmath26 can be explained by the linear dependence of net momentum increase inside the gap on @xmath26 . when separation distance increases above @xmath32 , the net momentum increase depends on @xmath26 in more complex fashion , which is consistent with the complicated behavior of total mean force coefficient .",
    ".normalized time - averaged increase in momentum flux versus separation distance [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we postulate that at small separation distance @xmath26 , the gap between the fish pair behaves like a peristaltic pump @xcite , which also has a transverse wave traveling from the entrance to the exit .",
    "such a pumping mechanism , which delivers a jet of fluid through the exit of the gap , is responsible for producing large net thrust at small separations .",
    "however , when separation distance between the upper and lower fish is large , more complex effects from the head and tail and nonlinear wake interactions appear . therefore , more thrust can be generated in smaller separation distance by the peristaltic pumping mechanism and comparatively less thrust is obtained at larger distance , which combines the peristaltic pumping mechanism with wake interactions .",
    "an example of the resulting time histories of the force coefficient in the @xmath18 direction , @xmath40 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2fish_dy1p5_phi1p0pi_cx ] for two cases , @xmath28 and @xmath41 . compared with the force history of the solo fish , the presence of the other fish results in a more complicated history , with notably different values for the peaks in each period .",
    "however , as @xmath26 increases , the force coefficient history becomes more like the solo fish history , with a sinusoidal shape , since the interaction between upper and lower fish is reduced to almost zero .",
    "it is informative to probe the notable differences in force exhibited in fig .",

    "both pressure force distribution and local vorticity field are shown in these figures .",
    "since the pressure force coefficient increases smoothly as @xmath26 increases , we focus our attention on two separation distances , @xmath28 and @xmath41 .",
