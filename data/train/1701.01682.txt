    "the term `` coronal mass ejection '' ( cme ) was created to describe visible eruptions of mass from the sun observed in white - light coronagraphic images of the outer solar corona @xcite ever since their discovery , cmes have been a very active area of solar physics research , due in part to the recognition that cmes are the cause of most strong , nonrecurrent geomagnetic storms @xcite .",
    "this research has been stimulated by a succession of space - based coronagraphs , particularly the large angle spectrometric coronagraph ( lasco ) instrument on board the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _",
    "( soho ) , which has been in continuous operation near earth s l1 lagrangian point since 1996 @xcite .",
    "however , remote observations are not the only way to study the cme phenomenon .",
    "many spacecraft launched into interplanetary space in the space age have carried plasma and field instruments designed to study the solar wind .",
    "most notable among those specially dedicated to studying the solar wind are _ wind _ @xcite and the _ advanced composition explorer _ ( ace ) @xcite , launched in 1994 and 1997 , respectively , with both spacecraft still currently monitoring the solar wind near l1 .",
    "the plasma and field instruments on such spacecraft can study solar transients such as cmes in  situ , with in  situ detections of cmes often referred to as `` interplanetary coronal mass ejections , '' or icmes .",
    "the cme / icme distinction represents an implicit acknowledgment that it is not always possible to clearly connect a presumed icme observed near earth with a verified cme event observed near the sun @xcite . from in",
    "situ data alone , there is no definitive procedure for unambiguously distinguishing icmes from the background solar wind and other transients such as corotating interaction regions ( cirs ) or stream interaction regions ( sirs ) .",
    "many icmes are characterized by a region of low plasma @xmath0 and strong , rotating magnetic fields , and these properties define an icme subclass called `` magnetic clouds '' ( mcs ) @xcite .",
    "by far the most favored current interpretation of mcs is that they are magnetic flux ropes ( frs ) , tube - shaped structures permeated by a helical magnetic field , with legs that stretch back to the sun @xcite .",
    "evidence for magnetic connection with the sun comes from the frequent observations of counterstreaming electron flows within such structures @xcite , which is more easily explained with a geometry with field lines bending back towards the photosphere in both directions ( as in the fr picture ) than with the field line stretching towards the distant reaches of the heliosphere in one direction . in principle , remote sensing should be better suited for studying global cme morphology .",
    "coronagraphic imaging , particularly from soho / lasco , has been used to provide support for the fr paradigm @xcite .",
    "in particular , large , bright cmes seen in lasco images are often found to have large circular rims , which can be interpreted as outlining the apexes of frs viewed edge - on @xcite .",
    "however , many cmes present a more confusing appearance in images , making morphological interpretation difficult . by enabling the simultaneous viewing of cmes from multiple locations , the _ solar terrestrial relations observatory _ ( stereo ) mission was designed to improve such analyses .",
    "the two stereo spacecraft , launched in 2006  october , were placed into orbits around the sun similar to earth s , but with stereo - a ahead of earth in its orbit and stereo - b behind , and with both spacecraft gradually drifting away from earth at a rate of about @xmath1 per year .",
    "each stereo spacecraft carries four white light telescopes that observe at different distances from the sun @xcite .",
    "there are two coronagraphs , cor1 and cor2 , that observe the sun s white light corona at angular distances from sun - center of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , corresponding to distances in the plane of the sky of @xmath4 r@xmath5 for cor1 and @xmath6  r@xmath5 for cor2 .",
    "and there are two heliospheric imagers , hi1 and hi2 @xcite , that monitor the interplanetary medium in between the sun and earth , where hi1 observes elongation angles from sun - center of @xmath7 and hi2 observes from @xmath8 .",
    "analyses of stereo data have provided further evidence for a flux rope morphology in cmes , at least for some events @xcite .",
    "this has led to the suggestion that frs lie at the core of all cmes @xcite .",
    "only a fraction of icmes are perceived as mcs @xcite , but this might be explained by noting that grazing incidence events may present a messier in  situ signature that will not be easily perceived as an mc , and for fast events the shock will subtend a much larger solid angle than the presumed fr driver , meaning that there should be many cases where an icme shock is observed in  situ without ever seeing the driver @xcite .    the case for the fr paradigm could be greatly strengthened by considering both in  situ and imaging constraints for a variety of events and demonstrating conclusively that the fr shapes inferred for these events from imaging are consistent with the mc encounter times and fr orientations inferred in  situ .",
    "the stereo spacecraft once again provide an excellent opportunity to do this , especially given their heliospheric imaging capabilities , which allow cmes to be tracked all the way to 1  au , where they can be observed in  situ by ace , _ wind _ , or by the stereo spacecraft themselves .",
    "a cme initiated on 2008  june  1 that ended up striking stereo - b on 2008  june  6 provided a perfect opportunity for such an assessment , and for this event the inferences of fr size and orientation from the imaging and in  situ data are in very good agreement @xcite . however , it is far from clear that this is the norm .",
    "we here present a survey of earth - directed events that can address this issue more fully .",
    "our goal is to use stereo and lasco data to provide a full 3-d kinematic and morphological analysis of a sample of cmes observed as mcs at earth , specifically by _",
    "wind_. aside from providing a nice sample of events to study the characteristics of cmes in the stereo era , we seek to address two questions in particular :",
    "what percentage of mcs detected at 1  au can be definitively connected to cmes observed erupting from the sun , and 2 . when cme images are analyzed in the context of the fr paradigm , are the inferred fr structures consistent with the characteristics of the mcs observed in  situ ?",
    "for our study , we confine our attention to a time period when the stereo spacecraft were well located to observe earth - directed cmes .",
    "we want events well constrained by stereo and soho / lasco imagery , and we want cmes trackable out to distances close to 1  au in the hi2 field of view .",
    "the requirement of being able to track cmes far from the sun is in part simply due to a desire to study cme kinematics far from the sun , and in part because tracking cmes all the way to @xmath9  au in images should maximize our ability to connect an mc with its corresponding cme .",
    "it is somewhat arbitrary where to draw the line between a good viewing geometry and a poor one , but in general the first year of stereo operations in 2007 was poor because the stereo spacecraft were still too close to earth to stereoscopically study earth - directed events very well , and the post-2012 time period was generally poor because the stereo spacecraft had by then drifted too far ( @xmath10 ) from the sun - earth line to effectively study and track earth - directed cmes far from the sun @xcite .    on 2012",
    "july  12 , stereo - a reached a longitudinal distance of @xmath11 from the earth , which we decide to mark the end of our survey time period , although stereo - b would not reach this angular distance from earth for another 3 months . as for the beginning of the survey period , we decided to avoid 2007 but to consider all mc events in 2008 .",
    "thus , the first step in defining our sample of events was to identify mcs observed by _ wind _ between 2008  january  1 and 2012  july  12 .",
    "our sources are the _ wind _ mc lists from @xcite , involving the use of both an automated procedure @xcite and visual inspection to find mcs in the _ wind _ database .",
    "@xcite have studied some statistical properties of these mc lists .",
    ".cmes associated with _",
    "mcs [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     figure  4(b ) divides the cmes into three categories , based on what solar surface activity is associated with the events .",
    "we will refer to events associated with flares as `` group  1 , '' events associated with filament eruptions but no flares `` group  2 , '' and events with no surface activity `` group  3 . ''",
    "if the five extra geoeffective events are included , groups  1 , 2 and 3 include 17 , 8 , and 8 events , respectively .",
    "the group  3 events are all slow , with peak speeds of @xmath12 km  s@xmath13 .",
    "the group  1 cmes are all faster than this , with one exception ( event # 9 ) .",
    "group  2 is intermediate , with half being slow ( @xmath14 km  s@xmath13 ) and half relatively fast , though none reach @xmath15 km  s@xmath13 .",
    "another very clear distinction in the kinematic behavior of these three groups regards the height at which the peak velocity is reached .",
    "this is shown explicitly in figure  5(a ) .",
    "we compute the average and standard deviation of this height for all three categories , and find @xmath16  r@xmath5 , @xmath17  r@xmath5 , and @xmath18  r@xmath5 for groups 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .",
    "note that for group  1 , euvi images of the cme fronts closer to the solar surface would be required to precisely assess the height when peak velocity is reached , as about half of these events are already at or near their peak speeds when they enter the cor1 field of view at @xmath19  r@xmath5 .    as shown in figure  4(b ) , all but two events that reach @xmath20 km  s@xmath13 subsequently decelerate , the example in figure  4(a ) being one of the two exceptions .",
    "the deceleration is presumably due to drag forces induced by collision with the slower ambient solar wind .",
    "for a few cmes ( e.g. , events # 15 and # 27 ) deceleration seems to happen very early at @xmath21  r@xmath5 , but in most cases the deceleration happens mostly further out .",
    "figure  5(b ) shows the distributions of heights at which cmes reach their final terminal speeds . for fast events",
    ", this would generally be where deceleration ceases , while for slow events this would be where acceleration to the terminal speed stops .",
    "the cmes reach their final speeds at heights ranging from @xmath22  r@xmath5 .",
    "half of our events have reached their final speeds by @xmath23  r@xmath5 , while 80% have reached it by @xmath24  au ( 64.5  r@xmath5 ) .",
    "finally , it should be emphasized that contrary to the velocity profiles in figure  4(b ) , it is likely that many cmes still exhibit some degree of deceleration at 1  au .",
    "our simple , multi - phase kinematic modeling approach neglects this by invariably assuming a final phase of constant velocity .",
    "quantifying residual cme deceleration at 1  au would ideally require observational tracking of the cmes well beyond 1  au .",
    "for the morphological part of our analysis , we use a parametrized prescription for generating 3-d fr shapes . for each such shape ,",
    "a 3-d density distribution is created with density placed on the boundary of the fr shape , and these density cubes are then used to compute synthetic images for comparison with real ones .",
    "parameters are varied until agreement with the data is maximized .",
    "probably the most widely used prescription for fr shape generation , and comparison with stereo imagery , is that of @xcite , for which there is a user friendly idl tool .",
    "we instead use a procedure first described by @xcite , and which has been subsequently used in many published analyses @xcite .",
    "the inner and outer edges of the fr are defined in polar coordinates with the equation @xmath25 this is a polar gaussian if @xmath26 .",
    "higher @xmath27 values create loops with flatter , less rounded leading edges .",
    "the @xmath28 parameter determines the widths of the loops , which can also be described by a full - width - at - half - maximum , @xmath29 as described by @xcite , the two 2-d loops defining the inner and outer edges of the fr are used to create a 3-d fr by first creating a sequence of lines normal to the inner edge , extending to the outer edge .",
    "the midpoints of these lines define the central axis of the fr .",
    "a 3-d fr can be created by assuming circular cross sections for the flux rope in all the planes defined by the normal lines . by stretching the fr in the direction perpendicular to the fr creation plane",
    ", an fr can be created with an arbitrary ellipticity , with the parameter @xmath30 describing the ratio of fr channel width perpendicular to the fr plane to its width within the fr plane .",
    "the two main advantages of this fr shape prescription to that of @xcite are the ability to assume elliptical fr channels , and the ability ( by increasing @xmath27 ) to assume frs with flattened fronts .",
    "note that @xcite have developed prescriptions for describing cme front shapes that could easily replace equation ( 3 ) , and then be used to create 3-d fr shapes . with straighter , more cone - like sides",
    ", these prescriptions may be better at describing the shapes of the trailing parts of cme fronts @xcite .",
    "there are three parameters describing how to orient the 3-d frs",
    ". a longitude and latitude in hee coordinates ( @xmath31,@xmath32 ) describe the trajectory direction of the center of the fr .",
    "a tilt angle @xmath33 describes how the fr axis is oriented relative to the ecliptic plane , with @xmath34 corresponding to an east - west orientation , parallel to the ecliptic , and @xmath35 corresponding to a north - south orientation , perpendicular to the ecliptic .",
    "a density cube containing a 3-d fr described by the above parameters is created , placing density only on the surface of the fr , assuming a gaussian density profile normal to the surface .",
    "@xcite list a number of parameters describing how density is placed on the fr surface , but these parameters are not of much interest for our purposes , so we do not discuss them here .    in order to confront the assumed fr shape with data , we first expand it to the appropriate size using the kinematic model described in section  3.1 .",
    "we assume that the same cme structure applies at all times during the cme s expansion outwards .",
    "in other words , we assume purely radial and self - similar expansion . in certain past analyses",
    "we have relaxed these assumptions and allowed for time - dependent evolution of cme morphology @xcite , but this is too time consuming for a survey of many events .",
    "our impression is that self - similar expansion is a decent , albeit not perfect , approximation for cmes expanding into the interplanetary medium .",
    "synthetic images are then generated from the density cube using a white - light rendering routine to perform the necessary calculations of thomson scattering within the density cube @xcite . in this way",
    ", we can generate synthetic images of the cme at any time and from any perspective that we want , for comparison with images from stereo - a , stereo - b , and soho / lasco .",
    "parameters are adjusted to maximize agreement between the real and synthetic images .",
    "this is done by trial - and - error , and subjective judgment is used to decide what is the best fit .",
    "figure  3 shows synthetic images computed in this manner for the 2012  february  24 cme ( event # 24 ) .",
    "considering the number of images we have to work with , we in practice compare real and synthetic _ movies _ of the images .",
    "movies comparing the real and synthetic stereo and soho / lasco images are available in the online version of this article , for all the events in our sample .",
    "a secondary consideration in identifying the best fit parameters is the agreement between the observed and predicted earth arrival time .",
    "this is an issue for the morphological as well as the kinematic part of the analysis , as changing the cme s shape or trajectory direction can affect the earth arrival time as much as changing the kinematics of the cme leading edge .",
    "the density and velocity profiles predicted by our best models are compared with the _ wind _ data in figure  1 .",
    "since we only place density on the surfaces of our frs , the very simplistic model prediction is for two density peaks , when _ wind _ enters and exits the fr .",
    "( in some cases the exit peak is beyond the time range displayed in figure  1 . )",
    "the predicted velocity profile is always one of decreasing velocity , which is a characteristic of self - similar expansion , where velocity within the cme must be proportional to distance from the sun for the cme to stay the same shape .",
    "these velocity decreases are similar to those that are generally observed within the mc time range , which will be discussed further in section  5.3 .",
    "figure  6 shows two different visualizations illustrating the 3-d cme reconstructions , the right one being a picture of the 3-d structure in hee coordinates , with an arrow indicating the earth s path through it as the cme expands outwards , and the left one being a map in the ecliptic plane displaying a slice through the 3-d density cube in that plane .",
    "the ecliptic plane maps indicate the stereo - a , stereo - b , and soho / lasco ( near earth ) viewing geometry for each event , with the hi1 and hi2 fields of view explicitly displayed for both stereo - a and -b .",
    "columns 28 in table  2 list the best - fit parameters of the fr structures .",
    "note that we are using `` s '' subscripts for all morphological parameters derived from empirical analysis of stereo and soho / lasco images .",
    "the @xmath36 parameter is an aspect ratio dividing the fr apex radius by its distance from the sun .",
    "a larger @xmath36 corresponds to a fatter fr .",
    "the @xmath37 parameter in table  2 , from equation  ( 3 ) , is the one for the leading edge of the fr and not the trailing edge , which can be different .",
    "the images of some of our faster events show a front out ahead of what we interpret as the fr ejecta , which is naturally interpreted as a shock .",
    "if this shock is sufficiently bright and trackable for a long distance from the sun , we model it as well as the fr , as we have done for past events ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to model a shock front shape , equation  ( 3 )",
    "is used to create a 2-d loop and then that loop is rotated about its center to create a 3-d lobular front . as in the fr modeling , the various parameters are adjusted to maximize agreement with the images .",
    "we ended up including shocks in the 3-d reconstructions of only five of the events in the table  1 sample , specifically events # 8 , # 15 , # 26 , # 27 , and # 28 ( see figure  6 ) .",
    "it is important to note that in the kinematic analysis in section  3.1 we always seek to follow what we perceive as the top of the fr ejecta , and not the shock , although the two can be difficult to distinguish sometimes , particularly in hi1/hi2 .",
    "it is not uncommon for multiple cmes to be visible simultaneously in the stereo and soho / lasco images . in some cases ,",
    "the other cme fronts are distinguishable from the one of interest to an extent that we simply ignore the other cmes , but in some instances we found it desirable to reconstruct multiple cmes to ensure that we are correctly identifying the one that hits earth and is responsible for the mc .",
    "thus , in figure  6 multiple cme structures are sometimes seen . in most cases",
    "the extra cmes that are modeled are not earth - directed , and are therefore distinguishable from the mc - related events of interest in figure  6 .",
    "but there are some exceptions ( e.g. , event # 22 ) , and there are also the two cases of two separate cmes interpreted as being responsible for two adjacent mc events in the _ wind _ data ( events # 20 - 21 and # 27 - 28 ) .",
    "discussion of individual events is provided in an appendix , which should be consulted for more details of each particular analysis .",
    "the @xmath38 value listed in table  2 is a quality flag indicating our assessment of the level of evidence for an fr structure within each cme , with @xmath39 corresponding to no evidence for an fr shape , and @xmath40 corresponding to very strong evidence in favor of an fr shape .",
    "event # 5 is the only one at the negative @xmath39 extreme .",
    "this is a faint event that is practically invisible in lasco and cor1 .",
    "it appears narrow and jet - like in the stereo images at later times , and it is simply too faint to provide any indication of what its structure might be , fr or otherwise .",
    "there is also only one event that reaches the opposite @xmath40 extreme , and that is event # 24 , shown explicitly in figure  3 .",
    "one of the features we look for in searching for evidence of an fr shape is a clear trailing edge for the fr , which is not always easy to discern . for event # 24",
    ", there is a bright prominence eruption , most clearly seen in the cor1 panels of figure  3 , which we believe can be interpreted as nicely outlining the bottom of an fr that is viewed face - on from the perspectives of stereo - a and -b .",
    "even south of the prominence , which fades quickly as the cme moves outwards , the hi1-b image in figure  3 shows a front that can be interpreted as the trailing edge of the fr channel . another crucial characteristic that we look for in assessing evidence for an fr shape is a clear dominant axis to the structure , indicating the orientation of the fr .",
    "the cor1 and cor2 images in figure  3 make it very clear that this cme has a wide angular extent in the north - south direction .",
    "but from the frontal perspective provided by the lasco / c3 image in figure  3 , it is clear that the cme is _ not _ very broad in the east - west direction .",
    "this cme has a dominant north - south orientation , consistent with an fr shape oriented roughly north - south .",
    "the 2008  april  26 event studied by @xcite would be another @xmath40 event , with a circular appearance from stereo - a s perspective suggesting an fr structure viewed edge - on , consistent with the clearly dominant east - west axis of the cme apparent from stereo - b s frontal perspective .",
    "nearly half of our events are assigned the intermediate @xmath41 value , which corresponds to an event that we believe we can model reasonably well with an fr shape , but which we suspect could also be modeled equally well with some other paradigm ( e.g. , the traditional  cone model  ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is of course significant subjectivity involved in our @xmath38 index , but with only 7 of our 28 events having @xmath42 or 5 , we can use it to state that even in the stereo era only about a quarter of cmes in our estimation present an appearance in images that provides clear positive evidence for an fr morphology , preferable to other morphologies that might be assumed . this could be used as an argument against the fr paradigm being correct for all cmes , but the overall case for the fr paradigm outlined in section  1 still seems strong to us .",
    "therefore , we instead believe that our difficulty in finding clear evidence for fr structures in all cmes , even with extensive stereo and soho imaging constraints , is indicative of the difficulties inherent in discerning magnetic structure from mass distributions , which will not necessarily outline the underlying magnetic structures very well .",
    "many of the measured cme and fr characteristics from tables  1 and 2 are displayed in the various panels of figure  7 .",
    "as in figure  4(b ) and figure  5(a ) , we find it instructive to divide our sample of events into three groups according to associated surface activity , with group  1 being flare - associated events , group  2 being associated with filament eruptions ( but no flares ) , and group  3 associated with no clear surface activity . also analogous to those figures , we include the five additional events from @xcite , which are geoeffective events not perceived as mcs at earth .",
    "figure  7(a ) illustrates how the character of our cmes changes significantly during the 20082012 period , indicating the shift from solar minimum towards solar maximum .",
    "the six 2009 events are all slow group  3 cmes .",
    "in contrast , all but four of the events from 20112012 are fast group  1 events .",
    "figure  7(b ) shows a clear correlation between cme speed and flare strength , although there is still significant scatter .",
    "the cme latitude and fr tilt angle are compared in figure  7(c ) .",
    "curiously , 28 of the 33 events have negative tilt angles ( i.e. , @xmath43 ) .",
    "in other words , the frs tend to be tilted in a northeast - southwest direction as opposed to northwest - southeast .",
    "we can think of no systematic error that would produce this , nor can we think of any physical reason why there would be such a tendency .",
    "thus , if not simply a statistical fluke , the cause of this bias remains a mystery . in any case , one purpose of figure  7(c ) is to look for a correlation between latitude and fr orientation . due to",
    "differential rotation , filament channels in the northern hemisphere tend to have negative tilt angles , and those in the southern hemisphere tend to have positive tilts @xcite .",
    "thus , one might expect to see an overabundance of events in the upper left and lower right quadrants of figure  7(c ) .",
    "this is definitely not the case for the group  1 and group  3 events , but may be the case for group  2 events , all but one of which are in the expected quadrants , the exception being event # 13 .",
    "it is the filament eruption associated group  2 events that would indeed most naturally be expected to show this behavior .",
    "figure  7(d ) indicates some correlation between cme speed and geoeffectiveness as measured by @xmath44 .",
    "the minimum @xmath44 ( `` disturbance storm time '' ) listed in table  2 measures the depression of the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field from a network of monitors near the equator , with large negative values indicating a significant geomagnetic storm .",
    "there is a great deal of scatter in figure  7(d ) , and no correlation at all would be apparent without the addition of the 5 extra geoeffective events .",
    "event # 23 looks like an outlier in this figure , with the most negative @xmath44 in the figure despite a modest cme speed of only @xmath45 km  s@xmath13 .",
    "figure  7(e ) plots fr width versus @xmath46 .",
    "the three groups of cmes are partly separated in this figure .",
    "the slow group  3 frs are small , with @xmath47  deg . for group  1",
    ", there is a clear correlation between fr size and cme velocity . for @xmath48",
    "km  s@xmath13 , the mean width and standard deviation are @xmath49  deg ; while for @xmath15 km  s@xmath13 , @xmath50  deg .",
    "the group  2 frs show a clear tendency to be larger than group  1 and 2 frs with similar velocities , with @xmath51  deg .",
    "it is two group  2 events ( # 19 and # 24 ; see appendix ) that are in fact the largest frs in our entire sample , suggesting that the largest cme frs are associated with filament eruptions from large filament channels rather than x - ray bright active regions .",
    "it is only the shocks that make the fast @xmath15 km  s@xmath13 cmes appear to be the largest of all cmes .",
    "our analysis suggests that their fr ejecta are not larger than the slower group  2 frs .",
    "figure  7(f ) shows the fr aspect ratio as a function of fr width . there is a correlation , with the larger frs being fatter , but it is not a tight correlation .",
    "we find no correlation between the ellipticity of the frs ( @xmath30 ) and @xmath46 , a correlation that one might expect if plowing through a slower ambient solar wind yielded flattened fr channels .",
    "in particular , for fast events with @xmath15 km  s@xmath13 , @xmath52 ; little different from the value for slow events with @xmath48 km  s@xmath13 , @xmath53 .",
    "the very modest ellipticity that we infer for our events is not in good agreement with past suggestions of substantial `` pancaking '' of the fr during interplanetary travel , corresponding to @xmath54 or more @xcite .",
    "our measurements would be in better agreement with analyses implying or at least allowing for more modest flattening @xcite .",
    "finally , we can compare our cme trajectory directions in table  2 ( @xmath31,@xmath32 ) with the locations of associated surface activity , listed in table  1 ( @xmath55,@xmath56 ) the angular discrepancy between the two has a mean and standard deviation of @xmath57  deg .",
    "flares are much more compact than filament eruptions , so group  1 events have a better defined source location than group  2 events .",
    "considering group  1 alone , we find a slightly lower angular discrepancy of @xmath58  deg . these angular differences are generally interpreted as being due to actual deflections in the cme s trajectory early in its journey from the low corona @xcite .",
    "one of the main reasons to use in  situ _ wind _ mc detections to define our stereo cme sample was to allow comparison of fr characteristics inferred from imaging with mc characteristics inferred from the _ wind _ data .",
    "below we discuss three different aspects of this comparison : orientation , size , and velocity / expansion .",
    "as discussed in section  2 , table  1 provides two independent assessments of mc orientation , both assuming an infinite cylinder geometry with the cylinder axes pointing towards ( @xmath59,@xmath60 ) and ( @xmath61,@xmath62 ) for the two measurements , respectively .",
    "we compute the angular discrepancy between these two measurements , and figure  8(a ) shows the distribution of these discrepancies .",
    "also shown is a line indicating what the distribution would look like in the absence of any correlation , showing the distribution of orientation differences expected for two randomly oriented cylinders .",
    "the agreement is certainly better than random , but the average difference is still a rather large @xmath63 .",
    "however , over half of our mc events have been flagged as poor @xmath64 mc events ( see table  1 ) .",
    "figure  8(a ) shows the distribution when the @xmath64 events are ignored .",
    "this significantly improves the agreement , with the average difference decreasing to @xmath65",
    ".    however , the main goal here is to compare these mc orientations with those of the frs reconstructed from the images .",
    "this is not a trivial exercise , however , as the @xmath33 tilt angle parameter only indicates the fr axis orientation at the fr apex , and not where _ wind _ actually encounters the fr in our reconstruction .",
    "figure  6 shows earth s path through the reconstructed frs . at each point within the fr , we can find the shortest line connecting earth to the fr axis .",
    "the plane normal to the fr axis containing this line then defines the fr orientation at that point . by computing this orientation at all points along earth s path through the fr , and then averaging these orientations",
    ", we estimate an fr orientation for earth in the infinite cylinder approximation , appropriate for comparison with the mc orientations . these measurements ( @xmath66,@xmath67 )",
    "are listed in the last two columns of table  2 . for the mc orientation ,",
    "the magnetic field direction along the central mc axis defines the direction quoted for the cylinder axis .",
    "however , images provide no such preferential direction , so both axis directions are possible .",
    "the direction quoted in table  2 is the one with @xmath68 , but the other axis direction ( @xmath69,@xmath70 ) is also possible .",
    "figure  8(b ) compares the fr orientations with both mc orientation measurements , and provides a line indicating what the distribution should be in the absence of any correlation .",
    "we have to compare with both possible fr axis directions and take the minimum to represent the discrepancy , meaning the worst possible agreement is @xmath71 instead of @xmath72 .",
    "the two distributions are similar to the non - correlation line , and the mean differences with ( @xmath59,@xmath60 ) and ( @xmath61,@xmath62 ) are @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively , only a little better than the @xmath75 value expected for no correlation .",
    "we sought to improve agreement by excluding @xmath64 mcs and cases where the analysis is potentially confused by multiple cmes or consecutive mcs ( see appendix ) . for the remaining 9 events , the mean differences with ( @xmath59,@xmath60 ) and ( @xmath61,@xmath62 ) are @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively , showing no improvement over the full sample .",
    "thus , we conclude that the image - based fr orientations are simply not in good agreement with the mc orientations .    inferences of cme morphology from images and in  situ data both carry substantial uncertainties that may be the cause of the poor agreement seen in figure  8(b ) .",
    "since images only show mass and not magnetic field , the image - based analysis involves the assumption that mass is loaded into the presumed fr in such a way as to reveal its shape , but this may not always be the case .",
    "the in  situ analyses are hampered by the fundamental difficulty of inferring 3-d structure from a single , narrow , 1-d trace of plasma properties through that structure .",
    "there are also physical assumptions involved that can be overly simplistic ( e.g.  force - free , infinite cylinder , etc . ) .",
    "it is possible to change these assumptions , in particular to replace the cylindrical approximation with an elliptical or toroidal geometry @xcite .",
    "it would be an interesting exercise to see if such assumptions would yield mc orientations in better agreement with the image - based inferences , but such an analysis is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "although we do not in general claim to be certain at this point whether the image - based or mc - based orientation measurements are preferable , for the subset of events from 2009 we would claim that the image - based orientations are more plausible .",
    "the 2009 events are all slow events with no clear surface activity associated with them .",
    "they are all streamer blowout type cmes that develop under the existing quiescent streamer structure , and therefore would be expected to have their orientation determined by that of the overlying streamer belt .",
    "all six of the 2009 cmes are centered near the ecliptic plane , and inspection of source surface synoptic charts computed from magnetograms shows that the heliospheric current sheet was relatively flat and near the ecliptic plane at the locations of all six events .",
    "thus , the expectation is that all six frs should have a roughly east - west orientation , meaning we should see @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "the actual measurements suggest averages and standard deviations of @xmath81  deg , @xmath82  deg , and @xmath83  deg .",
    "the image - based @xmath33 values best match the @xmath84 expectation , followed by @xmath62 , and lastly by @xmath60 .",
    "the fact that the ( @xmath61,@xmath62 ) measurements are noticeably more east - west than ( @xmath59,@xmath60 ) could be evidence that the prescription for relaxing the force - free assumption by @xcite leads to demonstrably more accurate mc analyses for these events .",
    "our image - based reconstruction of the fr morphology and kinematics of the cme provides a prediction for how long _ wind _ should encounter the fr , and these fr encounter times can be compared with the durations of the mcs observed by _",
    "wind_. this comparison is made in figure  1 , which identifies the mc regions and also shows for each event the density peaks predicted by the image - based reconstruction , marking the predicted entry into and exit from the fr .",
    "( we are ignoring the shock density peaks for purposes of this discussion . )",
    "there are usually two separate peaks for the entry and exit , except for grazing incidence cases that show only one peak ( e.g. , event # 18 ) . in some cases ,",
    "the exit density peak is not visible in figure  1 ( e.g. , event # 9 ) because it ends up beyond the the 3.5  day period used in the figure .",
    "these are typically cases where the earth and _ wind _ travel into the leg of the fr , resulting in a very late predicted exit time .",
    "it is very clear from cursory inspection of figure  1 that the predicted fr encounter times are generally much longer than the mc durations . in order to make a more clear comparison , we compute fr encounter times from the density peaks . for purposes of this calculation ,",
    "we define the fr encounter time as follows . for each event",
    "we define a somewhat arbitrary density threshold of 15% of the maximum density , and we define the entry time as being when this threshold is first reached , and the exit time as when this density is last encountered .    the resulting fr encounter times are compared with the mc durations in figure  9 , where we once again divide the events into the three groups used in previous figures .",
    "it should be emphasized that some of these fr encounter times are surely unreasonably long . in the self - similar expansion approximation used in the fr reconstruction ,",
    "the velocity at a point within the fr is proportional to its distance from the sun .",
    "thus , if _ wind _ is predicted to exit from the leg of an fr at a third of the distance to the fr s leading edge , the velocity at that point will only be a third of the leading edge velocity , which is likely to be unreasonably slow in most cases , leading to an implausibly long fr encounter time .",
    "in reality , the ambient solar wind will be impinging on the trailing parts of the fr , presumably accelerating them to higher velocities than our reconstructions would suggest .    with this caveat in mind ,",
    "figure  9 illustrates the degree to which the fr encounter times are consistently longer than the mcs .",
    "the average mc duration is 18.5  hr , compared with 54.8  hr for the average fr encounter time .",
    "the frs inferred from imaging are simply much fatter than would be expected from the mc durations .",
    "not surprisingly , the disagreement is less acute for the group  3 events , which are the narrowest frs , having the lowest @xmath36 values .",
    "the substantial fr / mc size discrepancy suggests that there is not a clear one - to - one correspondence between the fr channels inferred from imaging and those seen as mcs by in  situ instruments .",
    "perhaps the true magnetic flux ropes are the narrow structures seen as mcs , but these frs exist within larger icme channels outlined by messier , more irregular magnetic barriers , representing the channels perceived as fr shapes in images .",
    "this could also explain the orientation differences between mcs and image - based frs , as the mc orientation would not necessarily be identical to that of the larger icme channel .",
    "figure  1 compares velocities observed by _ wind _ with velocities predicted by the image - based reconstructions . but comparing the velocities requires some care .",
    "this is especially true with regards to shock and shock sheath regions .",
    "the images will be indicating the shock propagation speed while the speeds measured by _ wind _ will be the velocities of material moving through the shock , and these are not necessarily the same things ( see discussion of event # 24 in the appendix ) .",
    "the mc regions identified for our events should be cme ejecta , however , where the predicted velocities should unambiguously be in agreement with the observed velocities . therefore , we here compare the predicted and observed velocities within the mc regions .",
    "we compute mean observed and predicted velocities within the mc bounds ( @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively ) , and compare them in figure  10(a ) .",
    "the observed velocities are in reasonably good agreement with those predicted by the image - based reconstruction , with an average discrepancy of only @xmath87 km  s@xmath13 .",
    "this provides encouraging support for the accuracy of the kinematic aspects of the 3-d reconstructions . however , there are some curious systematic discrepancies .",
    "in particular , the reconstructions clearly tend to underpredict velocities for the slower cmes , perhaps due to perturbations of the mc resulting in incursions of higher velocity material into the mc region .",
    "the predicted velocities in figure  1 all have negative slopes .",
    "this is a consequence of the self - similar expansion assumption used in the fr reconstruction process . with this assumption ,",
    "velocity within the structure is proportional to distance from the sun .",
    "thus , trailing parts of the cme are slower , so velocity decreases with time .",
    "inspection of the mc regions in figure  1 shows that most do in fact show observed velocity decreases , qualitatively consistent with expectations .",
    "we perform linear fits to the observed and predicted velocities within the mc bounds , with the slopes of the resulting lines indicating accelerations seen at _ wind _ ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively ) .",
    "these accelerations are compared in figure  10(b ) .",
    "there is reasonable agreement for most events , with @xmath88 falling within @xmath90 m  s@xmath91 of the prediction for 75% of the events , but there are a number of outliers , particularly five events that actually have positive @xmath88 , suggesting a contracting mc instead of an expanding one .",
    "the nature of the mc expansion can be explored further by combining the @xmath85 and @xmath88 measurements .",
    "these two quantities are compared in figure  10(c ) . for self - similar expansion , velocity and acceleration",
    "are related by @xmath92 ( see below ) , where @xmath93 is the distance from the sun , and figure  10(c ) demonstrates that the measured @xmath89 and @xmath86 points naturally fit this relation .",
    "most of the observed data points fall above this line , suggesting the observed mcs are not generally expanding as fast as the self - similar expansion approximation would predict .",
    "this is better explored using the dimensionless expansion parameter @xmath94 defined by @xcite and @xcite . for self - similar expansion , @xmath95 .",
    "values of @xmath96 indicate expansion faster than self - similar , @xmath97 indicates expansion slower than self - similar , and @xmath98 indicates contraction . note",
    "that @xmath99 is essentially identical to the @xmath100 self - similarity factor derived by @xcite in the context of image analysis .",
    "figure  10(d ) plots @xmath99 versus @xmath88 .",
    "exactly 75% of the points fall in the range @xmath101 , which could be described as crudely self - similar .",
    "however , most of these points lie below @xmath95 .",
    "this is consistent with the measurements of @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that mcs with relatively linear velocity trends , which they refer to as `` non - perturbed '' mcs , tend to have @xmath102 .",
    "it is clear that many of our mcs would be considered `` perturbed '' in this regard , potentially accounting for the @xmath103 tendency .",
    "the kinematic profiles in figure  4(b ) represent a significant improvement in our understanding of how cmes propagate from the sun to 1  au , being constrained both by the observed earth arrival time , and extensive stereo monitoring continuously from the sun to 1  au . since we know the icme arrival times at _ wind _ for all 33 of these events , these measurements can be used to explore how cme velocity at a given distance from the sun relates to remaining travel time to earth .",
    "this cme arrival time forecasting is useful for operational space weather forecasting purposes .",
    "thus , we here explore the implications of our measurements for earth arrival time predictions .",

    "the uncertainties do not decrease any further with increasing @xmath104 .",
    "the velocities shown in figure  4(b ) and used in the analysis depicted in figures  11(a - c ) are leading edge velocities .",
    "one potentially significant contributor to the uncertainties @xmath128 and @xmath113 is that earth is not always hit near the leading edge of a cme . in many cases earth",
    "is hit by a part of the cme front well behind the leading edge , and therefore traveling slower . because our analysis involves a full morphological reconstruction of the cmes , we know what the actual cme speeds towards earth are , and we can make a version of figure  4(b ) with those velocities instead of the leading edge velocities .",

    "au , the uncertainties dip to an impressively low @xmath134  hr ( and @xmath135  hr ) , but they then actually increase for @xmath136  au , which is counterintuitive .    in order to explain this , we note that there are two primary sources of uncertainty : ( a ) the uncertainty in the velocity measurements providing the basis for this calculation ( i.e. , figure  4(b ) ) ; and ( b ) the intrinsic variation in 1  au travel time for a set of cmes at a given velocity at a given distance d , which may have different 1  au travel times despite the same starting conditions , due to different solar wind conditions between distance d and earth .",
    "the increase in uncertainty for @xmath136  au seen in figure  11(f ) can really only be explained by option ( a ) .",
    "it is quite possible that our velocity measurements are more uncertain for @xmath136  au .",
    "this may be because measurements from the hi2 field of view are simply intrinsically more uncertain , or it could be an artifact of our particular method of velocity measurement , assuming a few phases of constant velocity or acceleration , and always assuming a final , relatively lengthy phase of constant velocity ( see section  3.1 ) .    in practice , accurately estimating a sun - earth line cme velocity in a real time forecasting situation will not be easy , unless one actually has a spacecraft operating much closer to the sun on the sun - earth line .",
    "for now , the limited improvement in @xmath128 and @xmath113 is probably not sufficient to be worth the extra effort .",
    "we suspect that using the leading edge velocities is more practical .",
    "though even here we should emphasize that an effort must be made to estimate the true 3-d leading edge velocity of the cme , and not just a projected velocity in an image plane , which would not be appropriate to use in equation ( 6 ) .    in principle",
    ", the arrival time uncertainties of our proposed forecasting prescription can be compared with other published assessments @xcite , but in practice this is not trivial , as different analyses assume different constraints available at different distances from the sun , and use samples of cmes with different distributions of fast and slow events .",
    "some quoted 1  au travel time uncertainties are for predictions for the full travel time from near the sun to 1  au , and some are for predictions after the cme is already within a day or so of reaching earth .",
    "the last two columns of table  3 by themselves represent many different quantifications for 1  au travel time forecasting accuracy .",
    "we believe the uncertainties quoted for our prescription in table  3 are competitively low compared to ones cited in the papers cited above .",
    "but it should be emphasized that in an actual real time forecast , these uncertainties would have to be added in quadrature with the errors introduced by the uncertainty in the velocity measured for that particular event , and it is that uncertainty that may end up dominating the accuracy of the 1  au travel time estimate .",
    "we have conducted a survey of mc cmes observed by _ wind _ from 2008 to mid-2012 that can be tracked from the sun to near 1  au by stereo , performing a 3-d reconstruction of each event s morphology and kinematic behavior based on stereo and soho / lasco imagery .",

    "we find the fr paradigm to be reasonably successful at reproducing cme appearance in the images , but in our judgment only about a quarter of the events provide sufficient evidence for an fr shape to suggest that the fr paradigm is clearly preferable to other paradigms for cme morphology ( e.g. , the cone model ) .",
    "the fr orientations from our image - based reconstructions are not in good agreement with mc orientations inferred from _ wind _",
    "data , and the frs are usually too large to be consistent with mc durations .",
    "4 .   focusing only on six streamer blowout cmes from 2009 , which should have roughly east - west fr orientations , the image - based reconstructions generally recover the expected orientations .",
    "the mc analyses of the _ wind _ data are not as successful in this regard , but there seems to be significant improvement when the traditional force - free assumption is relaxed .",
    "the image - based reconstructions reproduce the observed mean velocities within mc regions to within @xmath87 km  s@xmath13 on average .",
    "the reconstructions assume self - similar expansion .",
    "exactly 75% of the mcs exhibit accelerations crudely consistent with self - similar expansion ( @xmath101 ) , though there is a clear tendency for slower expansion rates ( @xmath137 ) , probably due to perturbations of the mcs .",
    "our reconstructions provide full sun - to - earth kinematic measurements . after supplementing our main sample with five geoeffective events from @xcite",
    ", we find that 14 of 16 cmes with @xmath20 km  s@xmath13 have measurable deceleration in the interplanetary medium after reaching their peak velocity . 7 .",

    "this may be a case where    the first streamer blowout cme triggered an eruption from an adjacent    part of the streamer belt , resulting in cme2 , which ultimately yielded    the mc at earth .",

    ", the cme reaches the edge of    the cor1-b field of view well before it reaches the edge of cor1-a ,    but this changes by the time the cme exits cor2 , suggesting the cme    may have started out with a more westerly trajectory , quickly    deflecting eastwards in the cor2 field of view .",
    "we can not reproduce    this in our reconstruction without abandoning the self - similar    expansion approximation .",

    "the earth arrival time of our model fr is in better agreement    with the first mc , and its orientation is in better agreement with it    as well , so we simply associate the fr with that mc in table  1 .",

    "the first one ( cme1 ) , launched    at 16:35 on 2010  may  23 , is the one we associate with the mc .",

    "our reconstruction actually has the cme2 shock hitting    earth at about the mc start time , leading to the interesting question ,    what effect does the cme2 shock have on cme1 , and is there really any    evidence for the cme2 shock in the in  situ data ?",
    "we do not think so ,    and it seems to us likely that the cme2 shock seen clearly in the    imaging does not actually extend inside the fr of cme1 .",
    "this    contradicts the reconstruction in figure  6 , but this is simply a    limitation of the kind of reconstruction we are doing . in multi - event    reconstructions of this nature",

    "finally , we note that with    @xmath149 km  s@xmath13 , cme1 is the    slowest flare - associated cme in our sample , the only flare - associated    event that never exceeds 500 km  s@xmath13 .",

    "there is a cme that    erupts about 10 hours after our event .",
    "we believe this cme misses    earth to the east , and in our judgment remains separated from our    event to the extent that we do not do a reconstruction for it , but    this second cme confuses interpretation of the soho / lasco images    somewhat .",

    "there is an earlier event ( cme1 ) from    about 3:10 that is also relevant for this discussion , which appears to    be swept up and obliterated by the faster , brighter cme2 , early in the    hi1-a field of view .",

    "event # 15 : :    this event has garnered significant attention for being associated    with the first x - class flare of solar cycle 24 , and for providing    another interesting example of cme - cme interaction ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ;    * ? ? ?",

    "there is some uncertainty regarding whether cme2 and/or cme3 are    earth - directed , but our reconstruction ultimately suggests that only    cme3 , the fastest and largest of the three cmes , encounters earth , and    it only just barely grazes it .",
    "there are two consecutive mcs    identified in the _ wind _ data .",
    "we tentatively identify the cme with    the longer second one , as the fr orientation seems more consistent    with this one .",

    "this event and event # 24 shown in figure  3 have    several interesting characteristics in common .",
    "both are associated    with filament eruptions from very large filament channels , but no    flares .",

    "there is some    suggestion that a shock develops ahead of event # 19 in the hi1 field    of view , particularly visible in hi1-a .",
    "if true , this may be an ideal    case for studying shock development in the interplanetary medium ,    which happens slowly and far from the sun for this event thanks to its    relatively slow , gradual acceleration .",
    "events # 20 - 21 : :    there is a clear sdo / aia brightening and post eruption loops    associated with this event in an active region ( ar 11289 ) near disk    center , but the c2.9 flare taking place at about this time may be due    to simultaneous activity near the east limb .",
    "we call this a    flare - associated cme , but do not give a goes designation in table  1    due to this ambiguity .",
    "this is not the end of the ambiguity for this    event , unfortunately .",
    "there are two consecutive mcs associated with    the _ wind _ icme ( see figure  1 ) , and close inspection of the imaging    leads us to conclude that there are in fact two distinct cmes erupting    simultaneously from the same active region , which are very hard to    separate .",

    "/ c2 , the    combined cme is seen as a partial halo , with the part of the halo to    the west and northwest expanding faster than the part due north , a    further indication that this is actually two distinct eruptions ( cme1    and cme2 , respectively ) . from stereo - b s",
    "perspective the two cmes end    up almost perfectly superimposed after cor1 , but separation between    the leading edges of the two cmes is apparent for stereo - a .",
    "finally ,    there is a jet of material towards the west ( cme3 ) , which has been    modeled in the reconstruction as a lobular front ( not an fr ) , although    it comes nowhere near earth .",
    "the order of arrival at earth is cme1    hitting first and cme2 following only a couple hours later . the    predicted encounter times of both are easily long enough to encompass    both mc periods , so it is dubious whether we can really connect the    two cmes with the two mcs , but for purposes of our study an    association is required .",
    "both the arrival time order and fr    orientation are suggestive of cme1 and cme2 being associated with the    first and second mcs , respectively , so that is the assumption made in    tables  1 and 2 . in the _ wind _ data , near the icme start time , there is    a very narrow high density peak , which also has magnetic field    signatures .",
    "it is tempting to associate this very unusual in  situ    signature somehow with the complex nature of this event , with apparent    overlapping and interacting cmes .",
    "event # 22 : :    our analysis involves the reconstruction of four separate cmes : cme1    beginning at 9:20 on 2011  october  1 , cme2 at 10:00 , cme3 at 20:40 , and    cme4 at 1:00 on october  2 .",
    "neither cme1 nor cme3 are earth - directed ,    with the former being directed west of earth and the latter directed    well to the east , more towards stereo - b .",
    "cme3 is by far the fastest    and brightest of the cmes , with a clear shock that is included in the    reconstruction .",
    "this cme is already mostly out of the field of view at    the time shown in figure  6 .",
    "our reconstruction has both cme2 and cme4    hitting earth .",
    "the faster cme4 overtakes cme2 late in the hi1 field of    view and ultimately hits earth first , at a time close to the icme and    mc start time ( see figure  1 ) , so this is the cme that we associate    with the mc .",
    "figure  6 shows the situation at about the time that cme2    is hitting earth .",
    "there is always going to be some ambiguity in    interpretation when two cmes overlap like this , though .",
    "could cme4    have accelerated the cme2 fr , so that it is still cme2 that accounts    for the mc ?",
    "did cme4 deflect cme2 slightly to the east , meaning cme2    misses earth entirely , which our reconstruction can not reproduce due    to the simple radial , self - similar expansion assumption ?",
    "we prefer    this latter interpretation , but we note that the predicted cme2    arrival time corresponds to the time of a big density increase near    the end of the mc period in figure  1 , so perhaps that is the cme2    signature .",
    "event # 23 : :    this reconstruction involving three cmes is described in detail by    @xcite , so we do not discuss it in great detail here .",
    "only the second    cme to erupt hits earth .",
    "this is the most geoeffective cme in our    sample , as measured by @xmath44 ( see table  2 ) , despite    being of only modest speed ( @xmath45    km  s@xmath13 ) , and not being associated with a flare .",
    "event # 24 : :    as the only @xmath40 event in our sample , we have already    discussed this event in section  3.2 ( see figure  3 ) , and also above in    the discussion of event # 19 , which resembles this event in many ways .    with regards to its in",
    "situ signature , this is an instructive event    for illustrating the ambiguities there can be connecting imaging and    in  situ signatures of a cme .",
    "we see nothing in the images that we    associate with a shock , so the leading edge that we follow in the    images is interpreted as the leading edge of the fr .",
    "the predicted    earth - arrival time agrees very well with the icme start time marked in    figure  1 , but the _ wind _ in  situ data _ does _ show a probable shock at    that time , with the mc actually starting about 13 hours later .",
    "does    this mean that what we were following in the images was a shock all    along ?",
    "did that front suddenly become a shock at some point in its    interplanetary journey without us noticing ? given that our    reconstruction has earth encountering the southern leg of the fr ,",
    "does    this mean that there is more of a shock on the lateral parts of the fr    than near the leading edge ?",
    "there is not a very big density increase    at the start of the mc that would suggest that we would have been    following that in the images .",
    "it is notable that the predicted    velocity is much higher than the observed velocity for the period    between icme arrival and the mc start time .",
    "this is to be expected for    a shock and shock sheath , as images will track the shock propagation    speed , which will be faster than the speed of material moving through    the shock , which is what the in  situ data will be measuring .",
    "it is    also instructive to note that within the mc region the predicted and    observed velocity curves agree well , consistent with this being cme    ejecta ( i.e. , the fr ) .",
    "event # 25 : :    our reconstruction has earth encountering the north leg of a    north - south oriented fr .",
    "this cme is only just barely trackable into    the hi2 field of view .",
    "the _ wind _",
    "data do not show very significant    density , velocity , or field increases for this mc . event # 26 : :    our reconstruction includes a shock , which is clearly visible ahead of    this bright , fast cme ( @xmath158    km  s@xmath13 ) .",
    "this is easily the fattest fr in our entire    sample , with @xmath159 .",
    "this is a case where the    lack of a clear trailing edge to the fr prevents this from being a    very convincing case for an fr morphology , hence @xmath160    in table  2 .",
    "a spheroidal blob model might have worked just as well .",
    "our earth - arrival time prediction is nicely consistent with the mc    start time , but the _ wind _ data show a much earlier arrival for the    shock than our reconstruction predicts . events # 27 - 28 : :    there are many cmes occurring in this time period , greatly    complicating interpretation of the images . for our reconstruction ,",
    "we    decide in the interests of time to focus only on the two cmes that we    ultimately decide are earth - directed : cme1 starting at 20:45 on    2012  july  3 and cme2 starting at 16:45 on july  4 .",
    "these events are not    very apparent from the frontal perspective of soho / lasco .",

    "the two cmes of interest    are invisible in hi2-b .",
    "the difficulty seeing cme1 and cme2 in hi2 is    indicative of the worsening viewing geometry for earth - directed cmes    in mid-2012 , which is why we did not continue to analyze events after    2012  july .",

    "<S> we identify coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) associated with magnetic clouds ( mcs ) observed near earth by the _ wind _ spacecraft from 2008 to mid-2012 , a time period when the two _ stereo _ spacecraft were well positioned to study earth - directed cmes . </S>",
    "<S> we find 31 out of 48 _ wind _ </S>",
    "<S> mcs during this period can be clearly connected with a cme that is trackable in _ stereo _ imagery all the way from the sun to near 1  au . for these events , we perform full 3-d reconstructions of the cme structure and kinematics , assuming a flux rope morphology for the cme shape , considering the full complement of _ stereo _ and _ soho _ imaging constraints . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the flux rope orientations and sizes inferred from imaging are not well correlated with mc orientations and sizes inferred from the _ wind _ data . </S>",
    "<S> however , velocities within the mc region are reproduced reasonably well by the image - based reconstruction . </S>",
    "<S> our kinematic measurements are used to provide simple prescriptions for predicting cme arrival times at earth , provided for a range of distances from the sun where cme velocity measurements might be made . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the differences in the morphology and kinematics of cme flux ropes associated with different surface phenomena ( flares , filament eruptions , or no surface activity ) . </S>"
