    "classical novae are a subgroup of cataclysmic variables that went through a thermonuclear runaway explosion on the white dwarf .",
    "these white dwarfs are considered possible candidates for type ia supernovae .",
    "especially recurrent novae are known to exhibit massive white dwarfs close to the chandrasekhar limit and at the same time have high accretion rates , both ingredients to make a future sn explosion likely .",
    "classical novae with only one observed nova outburst are more frequent but their binary parameters like e.g. the white dwarf mass are less well studied . to do this",
    ", one has to wait a few decades after the nova eruption until the characteristics of the underlying cv become dominant in the post - nova ( see e.g. the detailed studies of rrpic by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* schmidtobreick et al .",
    "2003a ) and @xcite ) .",
    "generally , the long - term behaviour of pre- and postnovae is an open question ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* vogt 1990 ) ; ( * ? ? ? * duerbeck 1992 ) ) but important  for instance in context with the hibernation scenario ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* shara et al . 1986 ) ) . on the other hand ,",
    "our actual knowledge of post - novae is largely incomplete : almost 3/4 of the 199 nova candidates that erupted before 1980 still lack spectroscopic observations or even an unambiguous identification of the post - nova .",
    "a few years ago , we have started a program to re - discover old novae but concentrating on the ones which exhibited large outburst amplitude .",
    "we recovered and confirmed several of these systems ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ? * schmidtobreick et al .",
    "2003b ) , @xcite ) .",
    "we now use a similar approach to find general old novae  not necessarily high outburst amplitude ones .",
    "and we go one step further in the sense that we do not only want to recover the systems , but we also intend to derive the basic properties of the binaries which includes at the very least the determination of the orbital period of the recovered systems .",
    "the observations are done in three steps : + ( 1 ) to select possible candidates for the old novae , we make use of the fact that the light from a cataclysmic variable is provided by at least three different physical components : the white dwarf , the secondary star , and the accretion disc or stream .",
    "due to its size and high temperature , the latter is generally the dominant source in the optical range . while the white dwarf contribution affects mainly the uv range of the spectrum , the secondary late ",
    "type star contributes on the red and infrared side . the compound of these light sources results in characteristic colour terms that are distinct from normal field stars .",
    "cataclysmic variables appear as generally very blue objects with a shift towards the red at longer wavelengths . in a colour  colour diagram , they are thus found on the blue side but slightly above the main sequence . as an example , see the left diagram of figure[ilnor ] .",
    "+ ( 2 ) to confirm the candidates of step ( 1 ) , we take low resolution spectra and identify the cataclysmic variable via the typical emission lines ( see right diagram of figure[ilnor ] ) .",
    "+ ( 3 ) the last step is to take medium resolution time series spectroscopy of the confirmed old nova .",
    "we use the radial velocity variation of strong emission lines like h@xmath0 to determine at least the orbital period . in case of good s /",
    "n and coverage , also a further study of the line profile variation and a corresponding analysis of the accretion process is possible .",
    "in total , we have observations for 21 novae so far .",
    "17 systems have been confirmed spectroscopically , for the remaining four , several possible candidates were identified and await the spectroscopic confirmation .",
    "we have determined the orbital period for three systems and have constraints for two more . for more details on the results and a thorough analysis",
    ", we refer to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tappert et al .",
    "( 2011 ) ) .",
    "we conclude that our method works very well and the efficiency to recover the old novae is high .",
    "further observations are planned to obtain a sufficiently high number of systems for population studies ."
