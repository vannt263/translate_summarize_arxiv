    "superstring theory is a powerful candidate of particle physics including quantum gravity .",
    "it is defined on the 10-dimensional ( 10d ) space - time , and necessarily possesses extra dimensions from the viewpoint of our 4d world .",
    "many scalar fields and extra gauge symmetries generally appear after compactification .",
    "scalar fields such as moduli and dilaton are massless at the tree level , and how those fields are stabilized with suitable masses is a big issue .",
    "interesting solutions have been proposed in type iib string theory  @xcite .",
    "the study of effective field theories on a higher - dimensional space - time can provide useful hints to the stabilization of massless scalar fields .    in a higher - dimensional gravity theory , a scalar field called @xmath4radion  appears in the extra - dimensional components of graviton , and its vacuum expectation value is related to the size of extra space .",
    "the stabilization of the radius is crucial for the solution to the hierarchy problem in the randall - sundrum model  .",
    "it is also vital for the realization of inflation based on the radion  @xcite .",
    "the radius is fixed through the interactions with bulk scalars in the randall - sundrum background based on an orbifold @xmath5  .",
    "the stabilization is realized by the quantum effects of graviton and fermions in a 5d model with an extra space @xmath6  @xcite .    in a higher - dimensional gauge theory ,",
    "the extra - dimensional components of gauge bosons are massless at the tree level due to the gauge invariance , their zero modes become dynamical degrees of freedom called the wilson line phases and are stabilized by quantum corrections  @xcite .",
    "there is a possibility that realistic gauge symmetries including the standard model ones survive after the stabilization of the wilson line phases . as a solution of the gauge hierarchy problem ,",
    "it has been pointed out that the wilson line phase receives finite radiative corrections on its mass and can play the role of higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "an inflation model has been proposed based on the idea that the wilson line phase becomes the inflaton  @xcite .",
    "hence , it is interesting to study whether the radion is stabilized in the presence of wilson line phases or not .",
    "this question has been examined in a specific gauge - higgs unification model  .",
    "their studies are based on the warped space - time with the randall - sundrum metric and the branes on the fixed points of @xmath5 .",
    "in addition to radiative corrections from the bulk gauge bosons , their brane - localized kinetic terms are crucial to stabilize the radion .    in this paper , we investigate how a wilson line phase and the casimir energy from various bulk fields involve the stabilization of the radion in a different setup .",
    "concretely , we study the stabilization of an extra - dimensional radius of @xmath6 in the presence of a wilson line phase of an extra @xmath0 gauge symmetry on a 5d space - time with a flat background metric and without branes , using the effective potential relating both the radion and the wilson line phase at the one - loop level .",

    "as seen in the previous subsection , the potential has a finite minimum in the presence of neutral fermions whose numbers @xmath76 are bigger than @xmath77 and then the radion is stabilized at a certain finite value of @xmath32 .    a typical shape of @xmath70 is depicted in fig .

    "the stabilization of radion is realized in the presence of neutral fermions whose number is bigger than the number of charged ones by two .",
    "our result is different from those in a specific gauge - higgs unification model  , and this is mainly caused by the difference of setup . in the model with the randall - sundrum metric , the casimir energy from the graviton is exponentially suppressed because the graviton is localized around the uv brane .",
    "the bulk gauge bosons spread over the bulk @xmath5 and give sizable contributions to the potential , and then their gauge brane - localized kinetic terms are crucial to stabilize the radion . in contrast , we have considered the model with a flat background metric that every bulk field stretches out on @xmath6 and can give sizable contributions to the potential , and then the existence of bulk fermions is essential to the stabilization of the radion and the wilson line phase .",
    "it is straightforward to extend our analysis to 6d models .",
    "the radion and the wilson line phases in 6d models are expected to have same properties as those in 5d ones , by imposing periodic boundary conditions on fields .",
    "subject left behind is to apply our potential @xmath70 to an inflation model . by identifing the extra - dimensional component of the 5d gauge field and/or the scalar component of 5d metric as the inflaton",
    ", we examine whether the potential reproduces realistic inflation parameters or not . in other words",
    ", we have to study whether there is an allowed region of parameters in our potential to satisfy all the constraints , in order to realize the slow - roll inflation scenario  . now",
    "the radion and the wilson line phase may compete in giving rise to inflation . because the property of the radion differs from that of the wilson line phase , there is an interesting possibility that a hybrid inflation  @xcite occurs besides the extranatural inflation  @xcite and the radion inflation  @xcite .",
