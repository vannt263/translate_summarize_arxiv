    "in such a ` core + valence neutrons ' picture , it is natural to expect that 2@xmath2 state in @xmath136o should be more collective and have a larger iv deformation length due to the contribution of two more valence neutrons .",
    "however , the inelastic @xmath136o@xmath1 scattering data at 46.6 mev measured recently at ganil @xcite show clearly the opposite effect , with the inelastic cross section about 3 to 4 times smaller than @xmath136o@xmath1 cross section measured at 43 mev @xcite for @xmath11 state in @xmath6o .",
    "the folding + dwba analysis @xcite of these data using the method ( [ e3])-([e7b ] ) and original cdm3y6 interaction ( with the iv density dependence assumed to be the same as the is one ) has pointed to a much weaker neutron transition strength of @xmath11 in @xmath136o . given a significantly higher excitation energy of this state ( 1.5 mev higher than that of @xmath11 state in @xmath6o ) , the @xmath136o@xmath1 data at 46.6 mev were considered @xcite as an important evidence for the neutron shell closure occurring at @xmath138 or 16 . given the measured transition rate @xmath139@xmath97 @xcite for 2@xmath2 state in @xmath136o , we have obtained the proton deformation length @xmath140 fm for the proton transition density ( [ e3 ] ) . like in cases of @xmath8o , the neutron deformation length for @xmath11 state in @xmath6o was adjusted to the best description of the 46.6 mev data by the folding + cc analysis . since there are no data measured for @xmath1 scattering at 46.6 mev to 3@xmath116 state in @xmath136o , we have considered in our cc scheme only the coupling between the elastic and 2@xmath32 inelastic scattering channels ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "the folding + cc results are compared with the elastic and inelastic @xmath142o scattering data in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] . with @xmath57 fixed by the measured @xmath9 value , the best - fit neutron deformation length was found @xmath143 fm which lead to the ratios @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "these values are rather close to those implied by the is limit of @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "the deduced iv deformation length @xmath4 is around 30% larger than the is deformation length @xmath3 ( see table  [ t2 ] ) and this is much smaller than the difference between @xmath4 and @xmath3 found above for 2@xmath2 state in @xmath6o .",
    "thus , our results show a much weaker polarization effect by the valence neutrons in the 2@xmath2 excitation of @xmath136o nucleus .",
    "this subtle effect could not be accurately described by the continuum qrpa . while the qrpa calculation gives @xmath128@xmath97 ( in a perfect agreement with the measured value @xcite ) ,",
    "the predicted @xmath148 @xcite is nearly two times the empirical data .",
    "that is the reason why the cc results given by the original qrpa transition densities for 2@xmath2 state in @xmath136o strongly overestimate the data as shown in fig .",
    "like the @xmath6o case , the inelastic @xmath142o data are reasonably reproduced by both the folded and collective model ff based on the same deformation is and iv lengths . a significant difference given by the two choices of inelastic ff",
    "can be seen at larger scattering angles where no data point was measured .",
    "given a smaller iv deformation resulted from a weaker core polarization by the valence neutrons in 2@xmath2 excitation of @xmath136o compared to the @xmath6o case , it is quite illustrative to show the explicit iv contribution in the calculated inelastic cross section .",
    "we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] the calculated inelastic @xmath149o cross sections given by inelastic folded ff with the contribution from the isovector part ( [ p5 ] ) included or neglected .",
    "one can see that the iv contribution is very strong and amounts up 40% of the total inelastic cross section in the @xmath6o case , and it becomes weaker ( around 22% ) in the @xmath136o case . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ p5 ] ) , the iv part of the folded ff is entirely determined by the difference between the neutron and proton transition densities and its strength is , therefore , directly proportional to the contribution by the valence neutrons .",
    "consequently , it is vital to treat the iv dependence of the ( effective ) @xmath30 interaction properly in a folding model analysis of proton scattering on a neutron - rich target before the neutron transition strength can be accurately deduced .",
    "although one could still obtain a good description of the @xmath1 data with the is form factor only by scaling up the strength of transition densities , like in the folding model analysis @xcite of these same data using the same continuum qrpa transition densities and _ isospin independent _",
    "ddm3y interaction , it is uncertain to compare the best - fit @xmath7 ratios obtained in such an analysis with those deduced by our consistent folding method .",
    "we note further that the more advanced g - folding model @xcite was also used recently to study the same inelastic proton scattering data on oxygens @xcite .",
    "while the inelastic cross sections given by this g - folding model agree fairly with data in the angular shape , the authors need to scale the calculated @xmath1 cross sections by a factor of 2 , 5 and 1.6 to fit the data for 2@xmath2 excitation in @xmath10o , @xmath6o and @xmath136o , respectively , and this is likely due to a _ truncated _ single particle basis based on @xmath150 shell model wave functions only .",
    "the fact that the largest scaling was needed for the @xmath6o case in the g - folding model study also indicates that the higher order configuration mixing caused by the valence neutrons is strongest in @xmath6o and this result is in a sound agreement with our finding . finally , it is interesting to note that the contribution by the iv form factor to the @xmath1 cross section for 2@xmath2 excitation of @xmath6o is very close to the cross section shift presumably caused the ` isospin impurity ' in the @xmath11 excitation of the @xmath132 isobars ( compare fig .",
    "[ f6 ] and upper panel of fig .",
    "[ f8 ] ) .    with a direct connection between the iv deformation and dynamic contribution by the valence neutrons to the nuclear excitation ,",
    "it is natural to link the iv deformation with possible changes of the neutron shell structure .",
    "the best - fit is and iv deformation lengths of 2@xmath2 states in oxygen isotopes and those derived from the results of continuum qrpa calculation @xcite , using eqs .",
    "( [ e7 ] ) and ( [ e7a ] ) , are plotted versus the neutron number @xmath5 in fig .",
    "[ f9 ] . for the double - closed shell @xmath137o nucleus ,",
    "we have adopted the is limit with @xmath151 fm as deduced from the measured @xmath9 value and used in a recent folding model study of inelastic @xmath137o+@xmath137o scattering @xcite .",
    "an enhanced iv deformation ( with @xmath152 ) resulted from the core polarization by the valence neutrons can be seen for the open - shell @xmath8o nuclei , with maximum of @xmath4 observed for 2@xmath2 state in @xmath6o or at @xmath153 .",
    "such a maximum of the iv deformation also corresponds to the largest @xmath7 ratio found for 2@xmath2 state in @xmath6o . with @xmath5 approaching 14 ,",
    "the extracted @xmath4 value is drastically reduced and becomes rather close to @xmath3 which indicates a much weaker iv mixing in 2@xmath2 excitation of @xmath136o .",
    "a similar trend has also been predicted by the continuum qrpa calculation @xcite , although the predicted difference between @xmath4 and @xmath3 still remains significant at @xmath138 .",
    "this difference was predicted to be substantially smaller at @xmath154 ( see open squares and circles in fig .",
    "[ f9 ] ) , and it is natural to suggest from the @xmath5-dependence shown in fig .  [ f9 ] that @xmath4 is reaching its second minimum at @xmath154 . based on a similar @xmath5 dependence obtained for the iv deformation lengths of 2@xmath2 states in sulfur isotopes @xcite where a clear minimum of @xmath4 was found at the neutron magic number @xmath155 , the deduced @xmath5 dependence of @xmath4 for @xmath11 states in oxygen isotopes seems to suggest that the neutron shell closure occurs again at @xmath154 in oxygen isotopes .",
    "such a shell closure scenario is well illustrated by the @xmath5 dependence of the excitation energies of 2@xmath2 states in oxygen isotopes ( upper panel of fig .",
    "one can see that the energy of 2@xmath2 state goes through its minimum at @xmath153 , where the core polarizing contribution by the valence neutrons is strongest . as @xmath5 moves to @xmath154",
    "this contribution becomes much weaker and the excitation energy of 2@xmath2 state becomes larger because of the _ enhanced _ energy gap between the 1@xmath67 and 0@xmath156 neutron subshells .",
    "although the excitation energy of 2@xmath2 state in @xmath157o was predicted by different structure calculations @xcite to be around 4 mev , the experimental observation has been quite difficult due to the weak excitation of this state . in particular ,",
    "no @xmath1 data could be measured so far for 2@xmath2 state in @xmath157o .",
    "an important evidence has been found recently in the experiment on neutron decay of unstable oxygen isotopes by the michigan state university group @xcite , where 2@xmath2 state of @xmath157o was identified as a very weak resonance at the excitation energy of about 4.7 mev which undergoes direct neutron decay to the ground state of @xmath158o . assuming the weak @xmath95 transition strength predicted by the continuum qrpa @xcite for 2@xmath2 state in @xmath157o",
    ", our folding model approach predicts that the @xmath1 cross section for this state is at least factor of 2 smaller than that measured for 2@xmath2 state in @xmath136o @xcite .",
    "the ( unbound ) excited 5/2@xmath32 state of @xmath158o has also been observed in the same neutron decay measurement @xcite at an excitation energy of around 2.8 mev which fits well into the gap of about 4 mev between the 1@xmath159 and 0@xmath160 subshells predicted , e.g. , by the hartree - fock - bogoljubov calculation @xcite .",
    "based on this discussion as well as the systematics on the @xmath161-decay @xmath162 values and single neutron separation energies made by kanungo _",
    "@xcite for a wide range of neutron rich even - even isotopes , we can draw a definitive conclusion on the neutron shell closure at @xmath154 in unstable oxygen isotopes . to this end , more experiments for @xmath157o , especially , the @xmath1 measurement in the inverse kinematics would be of further interest .",
    "a coupled channel analysis of the @xmath0o@xmath1 scattering data has been performed , using the op and inelastic ff calculated microscopically in a compact folding model approach , to extract the neutron transition matrix elements @xmath14 as well as the isoscalar ( @xmath3 ) and isovector ( @xmath4 ) deformation lengths of 2@xmath2 states in the oxygen isotopes , with the proton transition matrix elements @xmath15 fixed by the measured electric transition rates @xmath9 .",
    "the newly determined ratios @xmath7 for 2@xmath2 states in @xmath8o have been compared to those deduced from the isospin symmetry , using the experimental @xmath9 transition rates of 2@xmath2 states in the proton rich @xmath10ne and @xmath6 mg isotopes .",
    "given the experimental @xmath9 values available for @xmath11 states in these four nuclei , a future high - precision @xmath1 measurement to accurately determine the neutron transition strengths of @xmath11 states in the mirror pairs @xmath10o,@xmath10ne and @xmath6o,@xmath6 mg ( in the inverse kinematics ) , should provide vital information on the isospin impurity in the @xmath11 excitation of @xmath12 and @xmath13 isobaric multiplets , respectively .    the enhancement of the iv deformation has been confirmed again for the open - shell @xmath8o nuclei which show a strong core polarization by the valence neutrons . along the isotope chain , the behavior of the dynamic iv deformation of @xmath11 state",
    "is closely correlated with the evolution of the valence neutron shell , and @xmath4 has been found to reach its maximum at @xmath153 which corresponds to the largest @xmath7 ratio found for 2@xmath2 state in @xmath6o .",
    "a fast decrease of the iv deformation towards @xmath154 should be connected with the neutron shell closure occurring at this new magic number of neutrons .",
    "the authors thank elias khan for helpful communications on the @xmath0o@xmath1 data and qrpa results for the nuclear transition densities .",
    "is grateful to h.s . than for his assistance in the numerical calculation .",
