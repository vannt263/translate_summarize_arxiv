    "the region of validity is approximately @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "effective approaches to qcd indicate an extremely rich phase diagram also for @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "experimentally the qcd phase diagram is accessible to heavy ion collisions . in particular relativistic heavy ion collision at sps / cern and",
    "rhic / bnl explore the region where hadronic degrees of freedom are expected to be dissolved .",
    "some results of rhic are now available that give hints of a non - hadronic state of matter  @xcite .    on the other hand light - front quantization of qcd",
    "can provide a rigorous alternative to lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "although the calculational challenge in real qcd of 3 + 1 dimension seems large ( as does lattice qcd ) it starts also from the fundamental qcd .",
    "the light - front quantization of qcd has the particular advantage that it is completely formulated in physical degrees of freedom .",
    "it has emerged as a promising method for solving problems in the strong coupling regime .",
    "light front quantization makes it possible to investigate quantum field theory in a hamiltonian formulation  @xcite .",
    "this makes it well suited for its application to systems of finite temperature ( and density ) .",
    "the relevant field theory has to be quantized on the light front as well , which is presently being developed  @xcite .",
    "i present the light - front field theory at finite temperatures and densities in the next section . for the time",
    "being it is applied to the nambu - jona - lasinio model ( njl ) model  @xcite that is a powerful tool to investigate the non - perturbative region of qcd as it exhibits spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and the appearance of goldstone bosons in a transparent way .",
    "finally , going a step further i shall give the general in - medium light cone time ordered green functions that allow us to treat quark correlations that lead to hadronization .",
    "the four - momentum operator @xmath6 on the light - front is given by ( notation of ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the energy momentum tensor defined through the lagrangian of the system and @xmath9 is the quantization surface .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath10 . to investigate a grand canonical ensemble",
    "we need the number operator , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the conserved current .",

    "the grand partition operator then becomes @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 defined in ( [ eqn : p ] ) and ( [ eqn : n ] ) .",
    "the density operator for a grand canonical ensemble  @xcite in equilibrium follows @xmath22 the corresponding fermi distribution functions of particles @xmath23 and antiparticles @xmath24 are given by @xmath25^{-1 } \\label{eqn : fermipm}\\ ] ] and @xmath26 .",

    "the light - front time - ordered green function for fermions is @xmath27 we note here that the light - cone time - ordered green function differs from the feynman propagator @xmath28 in the front form by a contact term @xmath29 and therefore coincides with the light - front propagator given previously in ref .",
    "@xcite . to evaluate the ensemble average @xmath30 of ( [ eqn : defcrono ] )",
    ", we utilize the imaginary time formalism  @xcite .",
    "we rotate the light - front time of the green function to imaginary value .",
    "hence the @xmath31-integral is replaced by a sum of light - front matsubara frequencies @xmath32 according to  @xcite , @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 for fermions [ @xmath36 for bosons ] . in the last step",
    "we have performed an analytic continuation to the complex plane . for noninteracting dirac fields the ( analytically continued ) imaginary time green function",
    "becomes @xmath37 where @xmath38 . for equilibrium the imaginary time formalism and the real time formalism",

    "@xcite as a model of quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) , where also a generalization to finite temperature and finite chemical potential has been discussed .",

    "the lagrangian is given by @xmath39 in mean field approximation the gap equation is @xmath40 where @xmath41 in hartree and @xmath42 in hartree - fock approximation , @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) is the number of colors ( flavors ) . for the isolated case",
    "@xmath45 is the feynman propagator . taking only the lowest order in @xmath46 expansion of the 1-body or 2-body operators",
    "the light front gap equation can be achieved by a @xmath31 integration , where in addition @xmath47 and @xmath48 have to be renormalized to accommodate the expansion .",
    "for details see  @xcite .",
    "the propagator to be used in ( [ eqn : gap ] ) is given in ( [ eqn : lfmed ] ) .",
    "the gap equation becomes @xmath49 to regularize ( [ eqn : gapmed ] ) we require @xmath50 . as a consequence @xmath51 and @xmath52 for the isolated case",
    "this regularization is fully equivalent to the lepage - brodsky one and the three - momentum cut - off . for the in medium case",
    "this @xmath53 regularization leads to analytically the same expressions as given in  @xcite for the instantaneous case  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the pion mass @xmath54 , the pion decay constant @xmath55 , and the condensate value are also available on the light - front  @xcite .",
    "the model parameters are adjusted to the isolated system .",
    "we use the hartree approximation , i.e. @xmath56 .",
    "parameter values are chosen to reproduce the pion mass @xmath57 mev , the decay constant @xmath58 mev , and to give a constituent quark mass of @xmath59 mev , i.e. @xmath60  mev , @xmath61  mev , and @xmath62  mev .",
    "the parameters are reasonably close to the cases used in the review ref .",
    "the difference between the bare mass @xmath63 and the constituent mass is due to the finite condensate , which is @xmath64 mev .",
    "in hot and dense quark matter the surrounding medium leads to a change of the constituent quark mass due to the quasiparticle nature of the quark .",

    "the fall - off is related to chiral symmetry restoration , which would be complete for @xmath65 .",
    "it is related to the qcd phase transition . for @xmath66",
    "mev the phase transition is first order , which is reflected by the steep change of the constituent mass . to keep close contact with the 3 m results we have chosen for the @xmath53 in - medium regulator mass @xmath67 with @xmath68 mev fixed for all @xmath15 and @xmath2",
    "we define the phase transition to occur at a temperature at which @xmath69 is half of the isolated constituent quark mass  @xcite . the phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] .",
    "the line indicates the phase boundary separating the hadronic phase from the quark gluon plasma phase .",
    "results presented in this section are based on an effective interaction in the @xmath70 channel .",
    "they have to be supplemented by the medium dependence of @xmath55 and @xmath54 that are currently underway .",
    "we are now interested in the @xmath71 channel .",
    "since we are going up to the three - particle system , we presently approximate the spin structure .",
    "to solve the full three - fermion problem on the light front even for the isolated case is quite a challenge .",
    "the spin structure is already rather complex , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "therefore the elementary spins are averaged tr@xmath72 ( in the medium ) and hence , for the time being , we are only dealing with bose type particles however subject to fermi - dirac statistics .",
    "our main focus here is to see how such a three - particle system is dynamically influenced by a medium of finite temperature and density ; ultimately , how nucleons are formed in the hot and dense environment of a plasma of quarks and gluons as the temperature and the density becomes smaller and how the relevant degrees of freedom in the fermi function change as the many - particle system undergoes a change to hadronic degrees of freedom . to this end",
    "we need to formulate suitable few - body equations that describe clusters of quarks in a medium .",
    "in addition , because of the drastic mass change , see fig .  [",
    "fig : mass ] , these equations have to be relativistic ones .",
    "the equations derived here are based on a systematic quantum statistical framework formulated on the light front using a cluster expansion for the green functions .",
    "the formalism has been given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "we repeat here the basics to make a connection to the previous sections . the light - front time ordered cluster green function",
    "is defined by @xmath73 where all particles @xmath74 are all taken at the same light front time @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the upper ( lower ) sign stands for fermion ( boson ) type clusters . because of the global light - cone time introduced , the dynamical equation for a cluster is equivalent to a dyson equation with a complicated mass operator that contains an instantaneous part and a memory ( or retardation ) part . for the time",
    "being we neglect the memory term .",
    "this is equivalent to a mean field approximation for clusters leading to faddeev - type three - body equations .    for a simple zero range interaction the @xmath77 matrix , fig .",
    "[ fig : t2 ] , separates and is given by the propagator @xmath78 , i.e. @xmath79 the expression for @xmath80 is represented by the loop diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : loop ] and , in the rest system of the two - body system @xmath81 , given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 given in  ( [ eqn : fermipm ] ) with @xmath85 where @xmath86 . for a fermi system",
    "there are two important effects occurring due to the blocking factors of ( [ eqn : b ] ) .",
    "one is the dissociation limit ( mott effect ) where @xmath87 . above a certain temperature and density no bound states",
    "can be formed .",
    "the second effect is related to the appearance of a bose pole in the @xmath77 matrix .",
    "this happens for @xmath88 and defines the critical temperature below which the system becomes unstable and forms a new vacuum consisting of cooper pairs or a condensate .",
    "this is related to superconductivity or superfluidity . in this case for @xmath89",
    ", we get @xmath90 i.e. both nominator and denominator of ( [ eqn : b ] ) are zero .",
    "the three - particle case is driven by the fadeev - type in medium equation @xmath91 where we have introduced vertex functions @xmath92 and @xmath78 given before , and an invariant cut - off @xmath93 . here",
    "the mass of the virtual three - particle state ( in the rest system @xmath94 is @xmath95 which is the sum of the on - shell minus - components of the three particles .",
    "the nucleon scale is introduced by setting @xmath96 mev .",
    "the isolated quark mass used in these calculations is @xmath97 mev .",
    "[ fig : mott ] shows a shaded area that reflect the region where the transition from baryons to quarks ( or quark diquarks ) occur .",
    "the area is defined by use of different regularization masses . the chiral phase transition given before",
    "is indicated by the solid line .",
    "[ fig : csc ] shows the possible transition of quark matter to a superconducting phase .",
    "we have given a relativistic formulation of field theory at finite temperatures and densities utilizing the light front form .",
    "the proper partition operator ( and the statistical operator ) have been given for the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the special case of a canonical ensemble is given for @xmath1 .",
    "the resulting fermi function depends on transverse and also on the @xmath98 momentum components .",
    "the @xmath98 components emerge in a natural way in a covariant approach . as an application we have revisited the njl low energy model of qcd .",
    "we reproduce the phenomenology of the njl model , in particular the gap - equation and the chiral phase transition .",
    "we have further given consistent relativistic three - quark equations valid in a dense medium of finite temperature .",
    "we find that the dissociation transition and the critical temperature for the color superconductivity agree qualitatively with results expected from other sources .",
    "however , the latter results are by no means final .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to write down meaningful consistent equations to solve the relativistic in - medium problem on the light front .",
    "the next steps would be to use the njl model all through to give a consistent picture for the @xmath70 and the @xmath71 channel .",
    "further insight into this just emerging possibilities of treating relativistic many - particle systems on the light front might be provided by other theories , like 1 + 1 qcd , the yukawa model , and finally real qcd .",
