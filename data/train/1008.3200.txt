    "recent wmap 7-year data @xcite suggest a red spectrum of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) with @xmath0 which supports the idea of hilltop inflation models @xcite where the inflaton sits near the top of a concave downward potential hill when cosmologically interesting scale exit horizon ( i.e. the number of e - folds @xmath1 ) .    the inflation scale is currently an unknown question",
    ". we may be able to know it if gravitational waves are detected in the near future , for example , via analysis of b - mode polarization of cmb data from planck satellite @xcite , the ground - based detectors quiet+polarbear  @xcite , or kek s future cmb satellite experiment , litebird  @xcite .",
    "however , for single - field slow roll inflation we can at least estimate the scale of inflation via dimensional estimation and it seems the most natural value of the scale is grand unification theory ( gut ) scale . on the other hand ,",
    "if we do not restrict ourself by using a single field , ( for example , in the case of hybrid inflation , we use two - fields ) the scale can be lowered .",
    "the reason is one field is used to provide the scalar potential and the other field can have a flatter potential since the end of inflation is determined by the waterfall field to become tachyonic . although the potential energy is mainly from the waterfall field , the curvature perturbation is from the quantum fluctuation of the inflaton field which is slow - rolling during inflation .",
    "the potential form for the inflaton @xmath2 of a hybrid inflation ( during inflation ) is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 .",
    "the spectrum is @xmath5 where prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "the spectrum is restricted to be @xmath6 from cmb  @xcite .",
    "we call this cmb normalization in this paper .",
    "as can be seen from the spectrum , we can lower the scale of inflation @xmath7 with a small @xmath8 while fixing the spectrum .",
    "an interesting possibility is to reduce the scale to a supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking scale .",
    "this is the case of supernatural inflation @xcite in which a gravity mediated susy breaking scale ( @xmath9 ) is chosen .",
    "interestingly , the model can work without fine - tuning with the mass @xmath10 of order tev which is the typical soft mass in the framework of susy .",
    "the characteristic feature of this model is that the spectral index @xmath11 is predicted to be blue ( @xmath12 ) , because the potential is concave upward .",
    "however , the recent wmap data suggests it to be red ( @xmath13 )  @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that hilltop inflation can produce a red spectrum  @xcite , so it is not surprising that if we can convert supernatural inflation into a hilltop form , the spectral index can be reduced to fit wmap data  .",
    "what interesting is that there is a way of achieving this without fine - tuning as well @xcite .",
    "we call it hilltop supernatural inflation in this paper .",
    "people work on susy inflation models know that there is a gravitino problem coming from thermally produced unwanted gravitinos which can put an upper bound for the reheating temperature .",
    "it is now becoming well - known also that there may be overproduction of unwanted gravitinos nonthermally by the inflaton decay @xcite which may put a lower bound for the reheating temperature .",
    "it was shown that many susy hybrid inflation models , for example , f- and d - term inflation suffers from this latter type of the gravitino problem .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that supernatural inflation does not have former type of the gravitino problem .",
    "the hilltop version of it does not change the energy scale nor the waterfall sector therefore the same conclusion applies in both cases . now",
    "a natural question to ask is whether ( hilltop ) supernatural inflation as a susy hybrid inflation has this new gravitino problem .",
    "this paper is mainly addressed on this question .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we review the idea of hilltop supernatural inflation . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we briefly summarize ( new ) gravitino problem . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we investigate the allowed reheating temperature as a function of gravitino mass .",
    "we consider both constraints from thermally and nonthermally produced gravitinos .",
    "we also consider the constraint from gravitino being a dark matter .",
    "[ sec5 ] is our conclusion .",
    "we consider a hybrid inflation from a flat direction in the framework of susy which will play the role of an inflaton .",
    "a flat direction is normally lifted by supersymmetry breaking terms and non - renormalizable terms with the superpotential @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the scalar potential along the flat direction reads ( after minimizing the potential along the angular direction ) @xmath17 where the first and second terms on the right - hand side are the soft mass term and the a - term respectively .",
    "the last term is simply the f - term potential of the superpotential . for gravity mediation susy breaking , we have @xmath18",
    ". we will focus on the case @xmath19 ( smallest @xmath20 ) and neglect the last term is small enough .",
    "therefore compare with the second term , the last term can be neglected .",
    "see @xcite for the details . ] .",
    "we hope to add to this potential a ( dominated ) constant term @xmath21 during inflation .",
    "this can be achieved , for example , by coupling @xmath2 to a waterfall field @xmath22 via a superpotential of the form @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is some large mass scale .",
    "the potential of the waterfall field ( without the above interaction term ) has the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the susy breaking scale which we choose as @xmath27 ( gravity mediation ) .",
    "this potential form is common in the framework of susy .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath28 is not very important .",
    "one of the possible choices is @xcite @xmath29 another choice may be @xcite @xmath30 during inflation , when the field value of inflaton is large , a large mass is given to the waterfall field from eq .",
    "( [ coupling ] ) .",
    "this makes @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "after inflation , the waterfall field rolls down to its vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath33 .",
    "the value of the mass of @xmath22 is around @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "however , we actually require @xmath36 in order for hybrid inflation to end promptly once the mass of waterfall field becomes tachyonic , but too much deviation form tev would be unnatural .",
    "it is also possible to have @xmath37 . in this case",
    ", a second stage of inflation could occur .",
    "we may consider this in our future work . ] .",
    "hence we obtain a susy hybrid inflation which we call _ hilltop supernatural inflation_. the potential during inflation is given by @xcite @xmath38 with @xmath39    the number of e - folds is given by @xmath40 from eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) , we can analytically solve the above integral and obtain @xmath41 the spectrum and the spectral index are given respectively by @xmath42 ^ 3}{\\eta_0 ^ 3(\\eta_0 x-4\\lambda)^2 } \\label{eq11}\\\\ n_s&=&1 + 2\\eta_0 \\left[1-\\frac{12\\lambda e^{2n\\eta_0}}{\\eta_0 x+4\\lambda(e^{2n\\eta_0}-1)}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since we consider gravity mediation , as mentioned , the natural values of soft susy breaking terms , @xmath10 and @xmath43 , are @xmath44 .",
    "the coupling @xmath45 is of @xmath46 , which makes @xmath47 .",
    "it is interesting that within those natural values , eq .  ( [ eq11 ] ) with cmb normalization can be satisfied and we obtain a successful inflation model with @xmath48 which fits wmap data very well .",
    "after inflation , both the inflaton and the waterfall field start to oscillate . before the reheating",
    ", actually the oscillating field can be the mixture of the inflaton field and the waterfall field .",
    "however , the lifetime of the inflaton field should be shorter than that of the waterfall field because the waterfall field has a large vev of the order of @xmath49 , unlike a negligible value of the inflaton field s vev",
    ". this would give a large mass to the inflaton via eq .",
    "( [ coupling ] ) . then the energy density of the oscillation should be dominated by the waterfall field .",
    "reheating happens via the decay of waterfall field through gauge or yukawa couplings @xcite , therefore the reheating temperature could be higher than @xmath50 . since we are considering a susy hybrid inflation , there could be constraints from gravitino production . in the following",
    ", we will first explain the gravitino problem from thermal production .",
    "we will consider nonthermal production in the next section and then the constraint to reheating temperature .    to simply illustrate the problem for the thermally - produced gravitino @xcite ,",
    "let us start from boltzmann equation for the gravitino number density @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the number density of standard particle whose scattering produces gravitino",
    ". then @xmath54 with @xmath55 being an effective number of relativistic degree of freedom in the particle content of the minimal susy standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "the gravitino number density @xmath56 produced is obtained via solving the boltzmann equation .",
    "we can approximately estimate the solution as @xmath57 therefore @xmath58 where we have used @xmath59 for massive gravitino .",
    "with @xmath60 to be gluino mass .",
    "] therefore thermal production of gravitino abundance is _ proportional _ to @xmath61 .",
    "a more accurate solution to the boltzmann equation for thermal production can be found in @xcite , which approximately gives @xmath62 \\left[1 - 0.028 \\ln\\left(\\frac{t_r}{10^{10}\\mbox { gev}}\\right ) \\right ] \\label{eq3}\\ ] ] since a large @xmath63 conflicts with big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , thermally produced gravitino provide an _ upper bound _ for the allowed reheating temperature  @xcite .      to illustrate nonthermal production of gravitinos ,",
    "let us assume our waterfall field @xmath22 with number density @xmath64 decays into two gravitinos.@xmath65 the number density of gravitino @xmath51 produced is hence given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the branching ratio  @xcite .",
    "the waterfall field decays when @xmath68 therefore @xmath69 where we have used eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and assume the entropy of the universe is from the waterfall field decay . as we can see from eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , in the case of nonthermal production of gravitino is _ inversely proportional _ to the reheating temperature . in our model , @xmath70 ,",
    "therefore @xcite @xmath71 by using eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , we obtain @xcite @xmath72 since a large @xmath63 destroys bbn  @xcite , nonthermal production of gravitino provides a _ lower bound _ for the reheating temperature .",
    "big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) put severe constraint on @xmath63 ( and hence @xmath61 ) @xcite .",
    "the constraint of @xmath63 is roughly @xmath73 . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) , by using @xmath74 and @xmath75 , we plot the constraint of reheating temperature as a function of gravitino mass in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] .",
    "here we assumed that the hadronic branching ratio is1 @xmath76 @xmath77 which is natural in massive unstable gravitino scenario .",
    "the dashed line represents the observational bound on the energy density of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) ( @xmath78 reported by wmap @xcite ) when a gravitino decays into a lightest susy particle ( lsp ) with the lsp mass @xmath79 .",
    "because we did not consider the thermal relic component of the lsp , this gives a conservative bound .",
    "when we change the mass of lsp , the constraint can be also changed and scaled accordingly .",
    "we also plot complementary constraints by dotted lines when gravitino is stable and becomes cdm for comparing by using @xmath80 this may be unnatural when gravitino mass is much larger than tev .     versus @xmath81 with @xmath82 .",
    "note that the constraint can be much milder only at around @xmath83 because of the suppression of the mode decaying into two gravitinos.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     versus @xmath81 with @xmath84,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     versus @xmath81 with @xmath85,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "in this paper , we have investigate the allowed regime of reheating temperature as a function of gravitino mass for hilltop supernatural inflation .",
    "we consider both constraints from thermally and nonthermally produced gravitino and also in the case when gravitino could become the dark matter .",
    "it is not easy to build a susy inflation model which requires no fine - tuning of parameters , predict @xmath48 , and without gravitino problem .",
    "here we have shown that hilltop supernatural inflation can meet all these requirement .",
    "there are some recent works about the effects of waterfall field to primordial curvature perturbation @xcite .",
