    "@xcite demonstrated the relationship between the maximum possible antenna gain - bandwidth product and the polarizability of the antenna obstacle .",
    "this is now recognised as a method of calculating a fundamental limit for antennas . the maximum electromagnetic scattering of a plane wave incident on an obstacle ( e.g. , metamaterial  @xcite",
    ", periodic arrays  @xcite ) is related to the static polarizability of the obstacle .",
    "popular commercial packages for antenna modelling , for example , ansys hfss , feko , awr , ie3d , etc do not calculate the polarizability .",
    "in this article we use the method of moments ( mom ) to calculate the polarizability of arbitrary geometries .",
    "the mom technique is commonly used in modelling wire structures for both radiation and scattering problems , assuming a thin wire approximation  @xcite . in the mom polarizability calculation",
    ", three dimensional structures are modelled using triangular mesh elements .",
    "the technique was implemented in matlab to calculate the polarizability of arbitrary shaped objects with infinite conductivity ( i.e. perfect electric conductors , pec ) .",
    "feko , which is an antenna simulation package , was used to create triangular mesh elements for arbitrary objects and the 3d mesh was exported to the mom routine in matlab using the stl format .",
    "triangular mesh elements have the advantage of constructing arbitrary geometries without staircase approximations .",
    "a brief description of the mom solution is described in section  [ sec_formulation ] .",
    "section  [ sec_implementation ] explains the implementation of the algorithm .",
    "section  [ sec_validation ] demonstrates the validity of the code by comparing the mom results with closed form solutions of simple geometric objects .",
    "in electromagnetics , laplace s equation is used to describe the electrostatic potential in a charge free region . assuming that the antenna has no static charge , then laplace s equation in the integral form is  @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the surface charge density and distance from the origin along @xmath3 axis when the object is located in a static field of the unit amplitude in the @xmath4 direction .",
