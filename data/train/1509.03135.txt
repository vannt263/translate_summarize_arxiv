    "the discoveries in the last decades revealed that approximately 95% of the universe is made of dark matter and dark energy . until today",
    "the true nature of dark matter and dark energy remains an open question .",
    "the string theory , one of the best candidates to solve the problem of quantum gravity , may provide an answer . scalar fields , which arise in some superstring theories , are promising candidates to explain dark energy and also dark matter . the low energy limit of the bosonic sector of the heterotic string theory is called einstein - maxwell - dilaton - axion ( emda ) gravity . this model is a nontrivial generalization of einstein - maxwell gravity and contains two scalar fields : the dilaton and the axion , which can be related to dark energy and dark matter ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the four - dimensional emda model is described by the action @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the scalar dilaton field and @xmath5 is the axion field , which is dual to the antisymmetric tensor field @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 is the dual of the electromagnetic tensor .",
    "a black hole solution of the emda field equations resulting from this action was found by garcia , galtsov and kechkin  @xcite .    a powerful tool to study black holes is geodesics , since the structure of the orbits of particles and light provides information about the black hole .",
    "the analytical solutions of the geodesic equations are useful to calculate the shadow of a black hole or observables like the periastron shift .",
    "those could later be compared to observations to test models and theories .",
    "the first to find the analytical solutions of the geodesic equations in a black hole spacetime was hagihara @xcite .",
    "he solved the equations of motion in the schwarzschild spacetime in terms of the elliptic weierstra @xmath0-function . in the taub - nut @xcite , reissner - nordstrm @xcite , myers - perry ( with equal rotation parameters ) @xcite and kerr - newman @xcite spacetimes , the equations of motion",
    "are also of elliptic type and were solved in the same way .",
    "however , if black holes in higher dimensions are considered or if the cosmological constant is included , the equations of motion are usually hyperelliptic . in a nutshell the integration of the geodesic equations can be traced back to the jacobi inversion problem and the solutions are given in terms of the @xmath1-function .",
    "this was done for the four - dimensional schwarzschild - de sitter spacetime @xcite as well as for higher - dimensional schwarzschild , schwarzschild-(anti)de sitter , reissner - nordstrm and reissner - nordstrm -(anti ) de sitter spactime @xcite .",
    "likewise the geodesic equations were solved in the kerr-(anti ) de sitter spacetime @xcite , in the higher - dimensional myers - perry spacetime @xcite and in the hoava - lifshitz spactime  @xcite . in five - dimensional black ring spacetimes ,",
    "the equations of motion could be solved analytically in special cases @xcite . moreover ,",

    "the particle on the bound orbit in figure [ pic : orbits-1](a ) has also an angular momentum with a different sign than the rotation of the black hole , but this motion takes place far away from the ergosphere and maintains its direction .    the test particle on the transit orbit depicted in [ pic : orbits-2](c ) crosses @xmath68 ( but not the equatorial plane ) and travels into a universe where gravity acts repulsive .",

    "two bound orbits ( figure [ pic : orbits-3](a ) and [ pic : orbits-3](b ) ) and an escape orbit ( figure [ pic : orbits-3](c ) ) with negative @xmath63 around a naked singularity can be seen .",

    "bound orbits at @xmath149 are always hidden inside the `` walls '' of the singularity .",
    "this region enclosed by the surfaces of the singularity can never be reached from the outside , nor can a particle leave the inside , since the singularity is repulsive here .",
    "this is also observed in the plots of the effective potential in figure [ pic : potentials](e ) and [ pic : potentials](f ) , which are similar to the corresponding potential of the bound orbit shown in [ pic : orbits-3](b ) .",
    "although the region inside the singularity can never be reached from the outside , we display the orbits for the sake of completeness .",
    "in this article we studied the emda spacetime with the help of geodesics and presented the analytical solutions of the equations of motion .",
    "the geodesic equations are of elliptic type and can be solved in terms of the weierstra @xmath0- , @xmath1- and @xmath2-functions .",
    "the dilaton parameter @xmath230 influences the @xmath63-equation , @xmath41-equation and @xmath225-equation , but the @xmath40-equation is not affected and is exactly the same as in the kerr spacetime , which is recovered by setting @xmath231 .",
    "the dilaton charge changes the shape of the singularity . at @xmath68 and @xmath31 we still have the ring singularity , but for negative @xmath63 the singularity forms a toruslike structure or two closed surfaces depending on the dilaton charge and the rotation parameter .",
    "similar shapes of the singularity of a black hole in einstein - maxwell - dilaton - axion theory have been observed in @xcite .",
    "since gravity becomes repulsive for @xmath149 , geodesics can only hit the singularity at @xmath68 and @xmath31 ( as in the kerr spacetime , these geodesics lie in the equatorial plane ) .    to determine the possible orbits in the emda spacetime , parametric @xmath122-@xmath123-diagrams and effective potential techniques were used .",
    "we found terminating orbits that end in the singularity and lie in the equatorial plane , escape orbits and bound orbits . in this spacetime escape orbits",
    "are possible both for positive and negative @xmath63 .",
    "bound orbits occur for @xmath232 and for @xmath233 hidden behind the inner horizon , but also for @xmath149 .",
    "these bound orbits at negative @xmath63 do not occur in the kerr case @xmath234 and are hidden inside the `` walls '' of the singularity .",
    "other possible orbits are two - world escape orbits and many - world bound orbits which emerge into other universes every time the horizons are crossed twice .",
    "additionally it is possible to cross @xmath68 and travel into an antigravity universe , resulting in transit orbits with the range @xmath235 and crossover two - world escape orbits which cross both the horizons and @xmath68 .",
    "the exact orbits and their properties can be calculated using the analytical solutions of the geodesic equations .",
    "additionally , observables like the periastron shift of a bound orbit or the light deflection of an escape orbit can derived with formulas analogous to @xcite .",
    "the geodesics of photons can be used to calculate the shadow of the black hole . in the emda spacetime",
    "the shadow was studied numerically in @xcite .",
    "hopefully one day all this could be compared to observations .",
    "+ for future work it might be interesting to extend the equations of motion and their solutions to electrically and magnetically charged particles",
    ". then the influence of the dilaton on the charged particles could be studied and compared to the particle motion in e.g. the kerr - newman spacetime .",
    "the analytical solutions to the geodesic equations of charged particles in the kerr - newman spacetime were found in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the nut parameter could be included by setting @xmath236 in the spacetime of @xcite .",
    "another option is to consider particle motion around a more general black hole spacetime containing more charges and a cosmological constant .",
    "an interesting candidate for this is the dyonic ads black hole in maximal gauged supergravity found by chow and compre @xcite .",
    "the emda black hole studied in the present paper represents a special case of the spacetime in @xcite .",

    "<S> we derive the equations of motion and present their solutions in terms of the weierstra @xmath0- , @xmath1- and @xmath2-functions . with the help of parametric diagrams and effective potentials we analyze the geodesic motion and give a list of all possible orbit types . </S>"
