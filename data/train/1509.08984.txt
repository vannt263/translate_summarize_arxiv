    ", we use the kubo formalism from linear response theory @xcite to establish for kondo insulators such as smb@xmath1 a functional dependence between the zero frequency ( d.c . ) longitudinal intra- and inter - band optical conductivity in the vicinity of the @xmath0 point on the rashba @xmath10 and dresselhaus @xmath11 coupling coefficients .",
    "the investigation of the conductivity properties in these materials can yield useful information about the relative strength of the two spin - orbit coupling hamiltonian components(rashba and dresselhaus ) . furthermore , for photo - detector applications under off - resonant light , tis exhibit a photo - galvanic response that manifests as a photo - current directly dependent on the intra - band conductivity .",
    "an off - resonant light does not excite electrons to a higher level due to energy conservation but alters the band structure ( for instance , a band gap may open resulting in a non - zero mass dirac fermions ) through second order virtual photon absorption processes @xcite .",
    "similarly , the inter - band conductivity is helpful in determining the optical transition rate which can be easily modulated via the tunable band gap of a topological insulator .",

    "the vanishing intra - band conductivity under off - resonant light therefore gives a zero longitudinal component of the photo - current .",

    "[ ham1 ] is purely linear and , as a result , for the psh state we obtained a vanishing longitudinal intra - band conductivity .",

    "another quantity of interest , that is closely linked to electron transport coefficients is the berry phase @xcite .",

    "[ ber3 ] and  [ ber4 ] express an identical result .",
    "as @xmath98 , the berry phase is zero yielding vanishing conductivity values .",
    "it is instructive to note that the berry phase which is trajectory - dependent can be altered externally through a gate that changes the rashba - like component .",
    "the rashba - effect changes the velocity @xcite and acts on the trajectory of the electron leading to a variation in the intra- and inter - band conductivity through an attendant berry phase change .",
