    "the planar mirror serves as a near - ideal reference mirror , which permits us to study the effects of the micromirror alone .",
    "the light of a grating - stabilized diode laser is coupled into the cavity through the fiber , and light transmitted through the plane mirror is collimated and detected with an avalanche photo diode .",
    "the whole stability range of the cavity can be covered with sub - nanometer resolution with a piezo step drive linear positioning stage ( pi lps-24 ) , onto which the fiber is mounted .",

    "the central part of the profile can be well approximated by a parabola .",
    "figure [ fig : mirror ] ( e ) shows the residual of a two - dimensional parabolic fit to the data .",
    "certain localized imperfections are present on the fiber surface , as well as an overall shape deviation .",
    "figure [ fig : mirror ] ( c ) also illustrates that the profile is not rotationally symmetric but rather has elliptical contour lines .",
    "this leads to hermite - gauss modes to closely resemble the eigenmodes of the cavity , and to a splitting of higher - order transverse modes of equal order . additionally , the ellipticity splits each cavity resonance into a linear polarization doublet @xcite .",
    "we use polarization optics before the fiber to select one of the modes for evaluation . the surface shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mirror ] ( b ) is rotated such that the principle axes of the profile coincide with the coordinate axes . the minimal radius of curvature in the center is found to be @xmath7 m  in @xmath8 and @xmath9 m  in @xmath10direction .",

    "we typically observe three different regimes : for small mirror separation @xmath17 , ( axial mode number @xmath18 for the measurement shown ) , the finesse stays approximately constant with only a slight overall decline . for intermediate mirror separations , individual axial mode numbers @xmath19",

    "fig .  4 ( a ) shows spectra covering the region around the fundamental mode for every axial mode order from @xmath35 to @xmath36 for @xmath37 . close to resonance , the transmission of the fundamental mode decreases ( see fig .  4 ( b ) )",
    ", while the transmission of the higher order mode increases until both have approximately equal height and minimal separation at the point of resonant coupling",
    ". the coupling is accompanied with an increased linewidth and thus a reduced finesse . at the anticrossing between the 00 and 04 mode",
    ", we observe a mode splitting of 8.6 ghz .",
    "we have modeled the coupling of the particular mode pair ( see below ) and find a value of 8.6 ghz , matching the measurement within errors .",
    "for cavity mirrors where the surface profile can be treated as a perturbation of a spherical shape , an effective approach is to describe the real eigenmodes @xmath38 as a series expansion of hermite - gauss modes @xmath39 , @xmath40 following the approach of kleckner et al .",
    "@xcite , we determine the new eigenmodes and the corresponding resonance frequency and loss . introducing the mode - mixing matrix @xmath41 , which accounts for the change a mode undergoes during one round trip through the cavity",
    ", the task reduces to an eigenvalue problem @xmath42 the mixing matrix @xmath43 has elements given by mode overlap integrals taken over the finite extent of the micromirror , @xmath44 here , @xmath45 denote the extension of the mirror , @xmath46 indicates the sign of the phase factor of @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the deviation of the mirror profile from a planar surface , and @xmath49 is the location of the micromirror on the optical axis .",
    "we assume that the respective expression for the planar mirror is an identity matrix .",
    "using the hermite - gauss modes for the expansion implies the paraxial approximation , where the isophase surface is parabolic ( with some deviation due to the gouy phase ) rather than spherical .",
    "however , the paraxial approximation does not hold at large separation from the optical axis where the two shapes differ .",
    "in fact , when including non - paraxial terms , one finds that a spherical geometry is indeed the most desirable @xcite . for a spherical mirror which covers an entire half - space , @xmath50 , and the eigenvalues @xmath51 corresponding to the eigenmodes @xmath38 are unity .",
    "as soon as @xmath52 deviates from spherical or @xmath53 is finite , @xmath41 has off - diagonal elements and transverse - mode mixing occurs .    for an accurate treatment of our experiment , we use the measured surface profile ( fig .",
    "1(b ) ) for @xmath48 . to find a suitable basis set @xmath47 for each mirror separation , we numerically maximize @xmath54 by varying the mode waist @xmath55 of @xmath56 .",
    "for a given mirror separation , the obtained optimal @xmath55 corresponds to an effective radius of curvature @xmath57 of a spherical mirror .",
    "the result for the profile investigated here is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : simulation ] ( c ) , showing that @xmath58 is larger than @xmath7 m  and increases with @xmath21 .",
    "consequently , the stability range is expected to extend beyond the limit of @xmath59 .",
    "the diffraction loss @xmath60 of a mode @xmath38 can be directly obtained from the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath51 , @xmath61 inserting this into eq .  [ finesse ] gives the finesse of this mode .",
    "the obtained finesse of the fundamental mode using the profile shown in fig .",
    "1 ( b ) is plotted in red in fig .  5 ( a ) , where we use the measured mirror transmission and loss .",
    "for direct comparison , we show a measurement of the cavity finesse as obtained from the resonant cavity transmission ( @xmath62 ) at a wavelength of 780 nm . for each data point",
    ", we measure 22500 positions on a @xmath63 m   area of the plane mirror and take the most prevalent value .",
    "the rise of the finesse for short cavities can be attributed to a systematic error of the measurement .",
    "the overall shape , the exact position of localized finesse dips , and the decrease around @xmath64 can be reproduced by the simulation with a high level of detail . however , to match the data , the lateral size of the mirror profile had to be rescaled by about 2.5% for the simulation .",
    "the same correction has been made for the simulation of the spectrum shown in fig .  3 , where the normalized phase of the eigenvalues @xmath51 is plotted .",
    "the mismatch might result from a calibration uncertainty of the interferometric surface reconstruction .",
    "in contrast , non - paraxial corrections of the mode frequencies @xcite are estimated to lead to relative frequency changes below @xmath65 for the current cavity geometry .",
    "the computed eigenvectors contain information about the composition of the system s eigenmodes from hermite - gaussian modes according to eq .",
    "[ eq : expansion ] . in fig .  5 ( b ) ,",
    "the coefficients @xmath66 giving the contributions to the fundamental mode are plotted as a function of mirror separation .",
    "the gaussian mode @xmath67 is clearly the dominant one , and for most cavity lengths , the ground mode shows negligible deviation from it ( see inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : simulation ] ( b ) ) .",
    "however , for certain distinct mirror separations where resonant mode mixing occurs , higher order modes can have significant contributions and lead to a severe distortion of the fundamental mode ( fig .",
    "5(d ) ) . the larger spatial extent of higher - order modes with @xmath68 causes larger diffraction loss , from which also the fundamental mode suffers under coupling conditions .",
    "notably , the locations of high loss and strong mode mixing do mostly but not necessarily coincide ( see below and @xcite ) .    regions of impact of certain mode families ( shaded areas ) cover a significant fraction of the stability range . still , for applications where the exact mirror separation is not essential , extended regions of negligible mode mixing remain .",
    "the different influence of e.g.  mode orders 4 and 5 can be attributed to the larger values of @xmath69 for even modes due to the symmetric mirror profile and modes with smaller mode index .",
    "also , for larger mode index differences , the differential gouy phase evolves faster and the resonance condition is sharper .",
    "the coupling strength can be directly inferred from the mode splitting at an avoided crossing .",
    "it is instructive to compare the results with a calculation for a profile obtained from a gaussian fit to the measured fiber surface ( green solid line in fig.[fig : simulation ] ( a ) ) .",
    "the smooth surface does not lead to the overall weak decline for increasing mirror separation , and the sharp features at intermediate @xmath21 are missing . yet , the finesse decrease around @xmath70 , which effectively limits the stability range , is reproduced .",
    "the difference can be explained by the presence of additional ( and in particular asymmetric ) surface deviations with mostly larger spatial frequencies and particle - like features in the measured profile .",
    "high spatial frequencies couple the fundamental mode to many transverse modes with large mode index , causing a smooth finesse decrease and significant resonant mixing for particular modes .",
    "the observed behavior is not limited to the particular parameters used in our experiment , but is a general property related to the profile shape and size . considering a gaussian profile with @xmath71 radius @xmath72 , depth @xmath73 , and @xmath74 , and assuming a cavity with @xmath75 where the mode radius on the curved mirror is @xmath76 , one finds that the relative mode size depends only on the profile depth for a given wavelength , @xmath77 .",
    "we perform simulations for a profile with fixed @xmath78 and ellipticity @xmath79 @xcite and vary @xmath80 . the resulting finesse is shown in fig .  [ fig:6 ] .",
    "while profiles as small as @xmath81 already achieve performance not limited by diffraction for small mirror separation , it requires a profile radius @xmath82 to extend this range to @xmath70 and @xmath83 to avoid mode mixing over the entire stability range . for comparison",
    ", we also perform simulations for a rotationally symmetric parabolic profile with @xmath84 and an edge length of @xmath85 . while the overall behavior is similar , the calculation for @xmath86 shows that resonant transverse - mode mixing can also lead to a reduction of diffraction loss @xcite .",
    "this can be understood by the destructive interference between the fundamental and the higher - order mode at the outer part of the mode , reducing the effective mode size @xcite .",
    "simulated finesse for different mirror profile size at fixed radius of curvature @xmath87 using various ratios of @xmath88 defined at @xmath75 .",
    "solid lines : gaussian profile . dashed lines : parabolic profile .",
    "we assume additional loss of @xmath89 for each mirror . ]    for obtaining the presented data , modes up to order @xmath90 are included in the calculation .",
    "using more modes does not significantly alter the results and strongly increases the computation time , which grows approximately as @xmath91 .",
    "for a fiber profile of @xmath92 pixels , the simulation of 300 mirror separations could be conducted with a personal computer within a few hours .",
    "our results comprise an extensive analysis of the performance of optical cavities with non - ideal mirrors . we have shown that localized reduction in cavity finesse , frequency shifts , and mode shape distortions are the consequences of non - ideal mirror shape and finite size .",
    "the behavior can be accurately modeled with a mode expansion method when using the measured mirror profile as an input .",
    "the demonstrated approach provides a powerful tool for analyzing a given cavity geometry and for predicting cavity performance without the need for detailed experimental characterization .",
    "this is particularly important for experiments where minimal mode volume and ultimately small mirror profiles are desired , as well as for cold atom , ion trap , and cavity optomechanics experiments , where larger mirror separations in combination with small radii of curvature are beneficial .",
    "the calculations provide improved accuracy for the determination of emitter - cavity coupling strength as well as detailed information about possible sample - induced scattering and loss .",
    "finally , the approach offers an efficient route for the design of novel cavity geometries with non - trivial properties , such as single - transverse - mode operation @xcite or mode imaging @xcite .",
