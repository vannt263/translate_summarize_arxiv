    "recently , it was shown that a specific class of metamaterials , known as hyperbolic media@xcite(indefinite media ) has the potential for thermal engineering .",
    "such media support unique modes which can be thermally excited and detected in the near - field due to the super - planckian nature of their thermal emission spectrum@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we adopt the techniques of fluctuational electrodynamics to provide a first - principle account of the thermal emission characteristics of hyperbolic media .",
    "we show that the conventional approach of utilizing the second kind of fluctuation dissipation theorem@xcite is equivalent to the scattering matrix method@xcite for calculating the metamaterial energy density .",
    "we specifically provide the derivations of the fluctuational effects in both effective medium theory and practical thin film multilayer metamaterial designs@xcite . while the characteristics can in principle be obtained from formulas related to the reflection coefficients , it does not shed light on various aspects of equilibrium or non - equilibrium fluctuations in the context of metamaterials .",
    "our aim is to provide an insightful look at prevailing approaches adopted to the case of hyperbolic media .",
    "we also consider the case of a practical phonon - polaritonic metamaterial@xcite and show the stark contrast in the far - field and near - field thermal emission characteristics@xcite .",
    "this should help experimentalists design experiments starting from analyzing the far - field characteristics , retrieving effective medium characteristics and then look for our predicted near - field effects .",
    "we show that the far - field characteristics are dominated by the epsilon - near - zero and epsilon - near - pole responses as expected from kirchoff s laws@xcite .",

    "we analyze the spatial coherence@xcite of the near - field thermal emission and relate it to the metamaterial modes .",
    "we show that there is a subtle interplay in near - field spatial coherence due to competition between surface waves and hyperbolic modes .",

    "in global thermal equilibrium , the first kind of fluctuation dissipation theorem@xcite(fdt ) directly specifies the correlation function of electric fields .",

    "firstly , it can be used to derive the electromagnetic stress tensor at a certain point .",
    "secondly , it directly gives the cross - spectral density tensor@xcite which characterizes the spatial coherence of a thermal radiative source .",
    "the second kind of fdt@xcite that specifies the correlation function of thermally generated random currents is @xmath3 we assume the permittivity @xmath4 is a diagonal matrix ; @xmath5 denotes the imaginary part .",
    "the first kind of fdt can only be used in global thermal equilibrium . in non - equilibrium situation",
    ", we should first employ maxwell equations to obtain the electromagnetic fields generated by random currents through the dgf , @xmath6 and then calculate the electromagnetic stress tensor or the cross - spectral density tensor .",
    "the dyadic green s function ( dgf ) satisfies an important identity@xcite , @xmath7 this identity ensures that at global thermal equilibrium the first kind and the second kind of fdt lead to identical results .",
    "in this section , we consider an uniaxial medium located in the lower space @xmath8 at temperature t while the upper space vacuum part is at zero temperature .",
    "the relative permittivity of the uniaxial medium is a diagonal matrix , @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "note that hyperbolic metamaterials are a special kind of uniaxial medium satisfying @xmath10 . as mentioned before",
    ", we should employ the second kind of fdt because this is a non - equilibrium problem .    to solve dgf in planar structures , it is convenient to work in the wavevector space .",

    "further by taking the imaginary part of the dispersion relation @xmath42 for s- and p - polarized waves , this result can be simplified as @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the energy density of blackbody.@xmath45 and @xmath46 are the standard reflection coefficients given by @xmath47 the propagating wave part @xmath48 in eq .",

    "correspondingly , the evanescent wave part can be interpreted as kirchhoff s law in the near field and @xmath49 is the near field emissivity@xcite , which is widely used in heat transfer problems .",
    "@xmath49 is also proportional to the near field local density of states ( ldos ) proposed in ref .   and",
    "is related to the tunneling and subsequent absorption of energy carried by evanescent waves .",
    "recently extensive theoretical and experimental works have demonstrated the ability of hmms to enhance the near field ldos@xcite .",
    "thus we expect the use of hmms in thermal and energy management .",
    "we can use the above definitions to compare the energy density in the near - field of the hyperbolic media to any other control sample .",
    "a pertinent question is about how much energy density is in matter degrees of freedom as opposed to the fields .",
    "this is difficult to answer inside the medium but can be done unambiguously in the near - field .    in the high - k approximation , where the wavevector parallel to the interface @xmath50 is sufficiently large , the near - field energy density is governed by the tunneling parameter which we define as the imaginary part of the p - polarized reflection coefficient . thus studying",
    "the behavior of this tunneling parameter sheds light on the near - field energy density . in the low loss limit",
    ", the reflection for p - polarized waves incident on an interface between vacuum and hmm can be expressed by@xcite @xmath51 while for an isotropic medium , the high - k approximation gives @xmath52 the most striking difference between the above equations is that for a conventional isotropic medium the near - field energy density is completely dominated by the imaginary part of the dielectric constant .",
    "these fluctuations disappear in the low loss limit and can be attributed to matter degrees of freedom .",
    "this is because the imaginary part of the dielectric constant which governs field fluctuations also characterizes the irreversible conversion of electromagnetic energy into thermal energy of matter degrees of freedom . on the other hand",
    ", the hyperbolic medium shows near - field fluctuations arising from high - k modes completely indpendent of material losses and the energy resides in the field .",
    "let us analyze what would happen at mid - infrared frequencies where phonon polaritonic materials can give rise to this low loss high - k limit for hyperbolic media .",
    "we clearly see from eq .",
    "[ high_k_iso ] that the near field emissivity would be very small when the frequency is away from the surface phonon polariton resonance ( sphpr ) frequency where @xmath53 .",
    "however , for hmms made of phonon polaritonic materials and dielectrics , the near field emissivity ( eq .  [ high_k_hmm ] ) can be comparably large in broad frequency region , though in this approximation its magnitude can not exceed one .",
    "note here we do not account for surface wave resonances which can change the picture considerably especially if one wants to optimize near - field heat transfer@xcite .",
    "our aim is to focus on the bulk modes only .",
    "in this section we will consider multilayered structures . in the field of metamaterials ,",
    "multilayered structures are widely used to achieve effective uniaxial media .",
    "the aim here is to go beyond effective medium theory and calculate the exact thermal emission from multilayered structures using the second kind of fdt .",
    "we assume that the medium in all layers is isotropic and non - magneto - optical for simplicity . to find dgfs relating the random currents in each layer to the vacuum region",
    ", we will follow the method in ref .  .",
    "firstly assuming the current source is in the vacuum region , we can calculate the fields induced by the source in all the layers by transfer matrix method which matches the boundary conditions at all the interfaces .",
    "thus the dgfs with source in the vacuum region are ready to be employed .",
    "next we use the reciprocal property of the dgf to achieve dgf when the sources are in the lower space .",

    "the final expression for thermal emission from a half space multilayered structure will be given by eq .",
    "[ general expression ] .",
    "the reflection coefficients should be that of the whole structure .",
    "if we are interested in a slab inside vacuum rather than a half space structure , we can eliminate the contribution from the last layer vacuum part .",
    "to do so , in eq .",
    "( [ last layer ] ) , for the last layer @xmath70 and @xmath71 , the right hand side is therefore @xmath72 , which vanishes for evanescent waves .",

    "we now describe another approach to evaluating the near - field energy density near metamaterials using the scattering matrix approach .",
    "however , first we will discuss a few important points related to the concept of the thermal environment .",
    "we note that when the lower space is vacuum , the reflection coefficients are zero . as a result of eq .",
    "( [ general expression ] ) , the contribution from the evanescent waves part is zero while that from the propagating waves is nonzero .",
    "however , this is not very intuitive from fdt .",
    "the reason is that losses of vacuum i.e. @xmath75 of vacuum is zero and from the second kind of fdt , the correlation function of random currents of vacuum should be zero , suggesting a zero field correlation .",
    "it turns out that for an unbounded vacuum region , we should add an infinitesimal imaginary part to @xmath76 , integrate over the region and then take the limit of the imaginary part to be zero in the final expression@xcite .",
    "this is needed to preserve causality requirements . in the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ general expression ] ) , we have integrated the source region @xmath41 from @xmath77 to @xmath78 . however , for a vacuum gap with any finite width , the final fields correlation originating from the gap can be shown to be zero@xcite .",
    "for this reason , fluctuations in vacuum can be interpreted to come from infinity .",
    "it is then natural to think about the thermal emission from the upper space vacuum region as well .",
    "if the vacuum region is also at temperature t , the system is at global thermal equilibrium .",
    "therefore we can employ the first kind of fdt to calculate the thermal energy density .",

    "however , in non - equilibrium , to determine electromagnetic fields induced by every random current inside the medium using second kind of fdt is quite laborious .",
    "we note from the second kind of fdt that the currents are not spatially correlated , which suggests that the thermal emission from different spatial regions can be calculated separately . in thermal equilibrium",
    ", we can calculate the thermal energy density by the first kind of fdt .",

    "once again , if the structure is a multilayered slab in vacuum , the contribution from the lower vacuum space can be evaluated using the scattering matrix method in a similar way to the upper vacuum space .",
    "the fields due to the vacuum fluctuations in the lower space transmit through the planar structure , @xmath100 it is clear that the contributing energy density will be proportional to the @xmath101 , so that we recover the result of eq .",

    "note that due to the reciprocal property , the transmission coefficients from two sides of the structure should be identical .    generally speaking , considering a single object in thermal equilibrium ,",

    "the two main peaks are due to the high - k modes in the hyperbolic region . in fig .",
    "[ fig : emission](b ) , we plot the wavevector resolved thermal emission at a specific frequency @xmath126hz within the type ii hyperbolic region where the structure supports both surface mode and high - k modes .",
    "the sharp peaks at the left are due to the surface mode while the high - k modes emerge at larger @xmath50 . in the high - k modes region ,",
    "the curve for 30@xmath105 m slab is almost flat indicative of a continuum of high - k modes .",
    "in contrast , the curves of 1@xmath105 m and 3@xmath105 m slabs clearly show the existence of discrete high - k waveguide modes featured by crests and troughs .",
    "surface waves can lead to large spatial coherence length in the near field@xcite . to see this ,",
    "we first show in fig .",
    "[ fig : sic_phase ] the wavevector resolved thermal emission from a 30@xmath105 m thick sic slab .",
    "the bright curve gives the dispersion of surface phonon polariton ( sphp ) between the vacuum and sic interface .",
    "note we will not see the splitting of the vacuum - sic interface sphp mode into long range and short range modes since 30@xmath105 m is in the order of several operating wavelengths . in the time domain ,",
    "the temporal coherence is best for monochromatic waves .",
    "thus for the spatial coherence , one can imagine it will be favorable if a single wavevector dominates the fields among all the wavevectors .",
    "this is indeed the case for surface waves . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spatial](a ) , we plot the spatial coherence of the sic slab at @xmath131hz and @xmath132hz . at the frequency @xmath131hz , the sphp mode wavevector @xmath50 is about @xmath133 .",
    "large spatial coherence length is seen at both 0.2@xmath105 m and 1@xmath105 m from the interface .",
    "however , near the surface phonon polariton resonance ( sphpr ) frequency @xmath132hz where @xmath134 , the mode dispersion curve is almost a horizontal line , which means that multiple modes with different wavevectors can be thermally excited .",
    "thus a poor spatial coherence is expected . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spatial](a ) , the spatial coherence is poor at at both 0.2@xmath105 m and 1@xmath105 m from the interface .",
    "this feature could be used to determine the resonance frequency .",
    "hyperbolic metamaterials can support multiple high - k modes .",
    "therefore the spatial coherence length should not be long in the hyperbolic region .",
    "this is true for type i hmm . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spatial](b ) , we plot @xmath98 at @xmath132hz , where the multilayered structure effectively behaves in the type i hyperbolic region .",
    "the spatial coherence lengths are only a fraction of the operating wavelength at both 0.2@xmath105 m and 1@xmath105 m from the interface .",
    "but the situation for type ii hyperbolic region is interestingly different .",
    "for a hmm slab in the type ii hyperbolic region ( @xmath120 , @xmath121 ) , the slab can support a surface wave mode as well as multiple high - k modes .",
    "thus we have two sets of modes that can result in a unique interplay of spatial coherence effects .",
    "furthermore , these modes are separated in wavevector space because of the lower bound of the high - k states in type ii hyperbolic region@xcite .",
    "high - k modes are confined to the surface better than suface waves and these high - k waves will dominate at a shorter distance from the interface .",
    "we choose @xmath131hz within the type ii hyperbolic region to confirm this point . at distance 0.2@xmath105 m ,",
    "the spatial coherence is very poor .",
    "however , at a larger distance 1@xmath105 m , the fluctuating fields have large spatial coherence length .",
    "this is because at this distance , the contribution from surface wave mode dominates the electric fields while the high - k states rarely contribute to the fields .",
    "this distance dependence behavior can have applications such as obtaining the modes distribution at a given frequency .          until now",
    ", we have fixed the fill fraction to be 0.4 .",
    "it is useful to examine the structure s behavior at various fill fractions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ttt](a ) , we plot the optical phase diagram@xcite of this metamaterial which shows the isofrequency surfaces achieved at different frequencies and fill fractions of sic .",
    "the phase diagram is classified as effective dielectric , effective metal , type i and type ii hmm as introduced before@xcite .",
    "[ fig : ttt](b ) shows the thermal energy density ( normalized to black body radiation into the upper half space ) evaluated using rytov s fluctuational electrodynamics for an effective medium slab at a distance of z=200 nm from the metamaterial .",
    "it is seen that the regions of hyperbolic behavior exhibit super - planckian thermal emission in agreement with our previous analytical approximation , but here we will go beyond effective medium theory and consider practical structures .",
    "the role of the surface waves is very important and can lead to significant deviations when the unit cell size is not significantly subwavelength@xcite .",
    "the macroscopic homogenization utilized to define a bulk electromagnetic response is valid when the wavelength of operation exceeds the unit cell size ( @xmath135 ) . however , even at such wavelengths if one considers incident evanescent waves on the metamaterial the unit cell microstructure causes significant deviations from emt .",
    "this is an important issue to be considered for quantum and thermal applications where the near - field properties essentially arise from evanescent wave engineering ( high - k modes)@xcite . for the multilayer hmm , at distances below the unit cell size",
    ", the thermal emission is dominated by evanescent waves with lateral wavevectors @xmath136 .",
    "since this is above the unit - cell cut off of the metamaterial , the high - k modes do not contribute to thermal emission at such distances .",
    "it is therefore necessary to consider thermal emission from a practical multi - layer structure taking into account the layer thicknesses .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ttt](c ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : ttt](d ) .",
    "the unit cell size is 200 nm , and we consider a semi - infinite multilayer medium using the formalism outlined in ref .  .",
    "an excellent agreement is seen of the optical phases of the multilayer structure with the emt calculation .",
    "this work shows that extension of equilibrium and non - equilibrium fluctuational electrodynamics to the case of metamaterials can lead to novel phenomena and applications in thermal photonics .",
    "we presented a unified picture of far - field and near - field spectra for experimentalists and also introduced the near - field spatial coherence properties of hyperbolic media .",
    "we have analyzed in detail thermal topological transtions and super - planckian thermal emission in practical phonon - polaritonic hyperbolic metamaterials .",
    "we paid particular attention not only to the effective medium approximation but discussed all non - idealities limiting the super - planckian thermal emission from hmms .",
    "we have provided practical designs to experimentally measure and isolate our predicted effect .",
