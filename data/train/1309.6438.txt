    "critical phenomena in disordered and frustrated systems such as spin glasses are one of the hardest problems in the statistical mechanics theory .",
    "extensive numerical simulations of the three - dimensional ( 3d ) ising spin - glass model @xcite for example , have confirmed that this system undergoes a transition at a finite critical temperature , but the nature of this phase transition is still under discussion .",
    "more controversial is the case of those models with xy - type spins . while early studies of 3d xy spin glasses indicated",
    "the existence of a transition at very low or zero temperature,@xcite subsequent numerical simulations reveal other possible scenarios .    in 3d",
    "xy spin - glass models , two kinds of symmetries can be broken because the hamiltonian is invariant under both , the usual continuous `` spin '' o(2 ) symmetry associated to a global rotation , and the `` chiral '' symmetry associated to the reflection of xy spins about an arbitrary direction . following the seminal work of villain,@xcite some works",
    "have shown the possibility that the spin order and the chiral order occur at different critical temperatures , which is known as the `` spin - chiral decoupling '' scenario.@xcite nevertheless , other numerical simulation studies suggest the existence of a single finite critical temperature at which both symmetries are simultaneously broken.@xcite recently , an even more complex scenario has been proposed , in which the lower critical dimension of the model could be close or equal to three , and then the finite - temperature phase transition should be removed by fluctuations .",
    "@xcite in this case only a marginal behavior for low temperature and large sizes should be expected .",
    "for a recent review interested readers can refer to ref . .    in all these studies , extensive equilibrium and nonequilibrium simulations",
    "were performed to solve this intricate subject .",
    "the lack of a consensus is probably due to the hardness of the problem .",
    "recently , a new nonequilibrium aging method ( nam ) was proposed to analyze such situations .",
    "@xcite calculating the correlation and the integrated response functions for different temperatures and waiting times , it is possible to determine both the critical temperature and the nonequilibrium scaling exponents . using this very sensitive technique ,",
    "it has been possible to corroborate that the universality class of the equilibrium phase transition in 3d ising spin glasses does not depend on the exact form of the bond distribution.@xcite    with the aid of the nonequilibrium aging method proposed in ref .",
    ", in this work we study the equilibrium critical behavior of three different 3d xy systems : the classical ferromagnetic xy model , the gauge - glass model @xcite and , in more detail , the xy spin - glass model with both gaussian and bimodal bond distributions .",
    "the first two systems of this class are mainly analyzed to show that the nam numerical technique is useful to locate the critical point of either an ordered or a disordered model with xy - type spins . nevertheless ,",
    "for the gauge - glass model , we report precise values of both the critical temperature and the nonequilibrium exponents , improving previous estimates . on the other hand , for the xy spin - glass models , our results strongly support the existence of a spin- chiral decoupling scenario where the chiral order occurs at finite temperature while the spins order at very low or zero temperature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ method ] , we present the nonequilibrium aging method and the simulation scheme . then , in sec .",

    "numerical nonequilibrium relaxation methods are frequently used to analyze equilibrium phase transitions.@xcite the simplest protocol consists in preparing the system at time @xmath0 , in a fully - ordered state and then the dynamics is simulated with a standard monte carlo algorithm .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath1 is estimated as the temperature at which , in the asymptotic regime , the order parameter follows a power - law dependence in time .",
    "this method is appropriate to study a wide variety of systems , since the slow dynamics present in disordered and frustrated systems favors the application of such nonequilibrium technique .",
    "however , due mainly to the fact that different observables seem to decay by a power law in a relatively wide interval of temperatures , it is not possible to determine an accurate value of @xmath1 with these methods .",
    "additional scaling analysis of the order parameter or susceptibility has been used to improve the resolution of these methods.@xcite in addition , recently it has been proposed a new technique based on the divergence of the relaxation time approaching the critical point .",
    "@xcite    the nonequilibrium aging method ( nam ) proposed in ref .",
    "is a general technique that allows us to overcome these difficulties .",
    "first , a typical protocol is used which consists on a quench at @xmath0 from a disordered state ( @xmath2 ) to a low temperature @xmath3 . from this initial condition ,",
    "the system is simulated by a model a dynamics,@xcite in this case a standard glauber dynamics .",
    "then , a given autocorrelation function @xmath4 and its associated integrated autoresponse function @xmath5 ( or merely the correlation and the integrated response functions ) , which depend on both , the waiting time @xmath6 when the measurement begins and a given time @xmath7 , are calculated for different temperatures and different values of @xmath6 . later , for each set of curves of a given @xmath3 , a data collapse analysis is performed based on the following scaling relations for the correlation function @xmath8 and for the integrated response function @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are two nonequilibrium exponents , and @xmath12 are two different scaling functions.@xcite relations ( [ scalingcorr ] ) and ( [ scalingresp ] ) are expected to be correct only at the critical point with @xmath13 and for @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite the best data collapse , and therefore the best candidate values for @xmath10 and @xmath11 at a given @xmath3 , is obtained by minimizing the sum of squared differences between all pairs of curves within a given range of times ( see details in the following ) .",
    "then , to identify @xmath1 , simply we chose the temperature for which the condition @xmath13 is fulfilled . note that , for temperatures above or below @xmath1 , the method provides only pseudo - exponents because other scaling relations , or a separation of the correlation and the response functions in their corresponding stationary and aging terms,@xcite are required . throughout this work",

    "nevertheless , it has been proposed that a generalized quasi - fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( qfdt ) @xcite of the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the fluctuation - dissipation ratio , must be obeyed by any physical model . for short times ( @xmath31 ) , a system is in the quasi - equilibrium regime ( @xmath32 ) and therefore a parametric plot of @xmath33 vs. @xmath34 should show a straight line of slope @xmath35 . on the other hand , for long times ( @xmath36 )",
    "we can write @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 in a critical quench , it is expected that the spin correlation ( [ corrs ] ) and the spin integrated response ( [ resps ] ) follow , respectively , the scaling relations ( [ scalingcorr ] ) and ( [ scalingresp ] ) .    for the xy spin - glass systems , we can also define the local chirality of each square plaquette @xmath39 by @xcite @xmath40 where the sum runs over the four bonds of strength @xmath41 surrounding the plaquette @xmath39 in a clockwise direction .",

    "the integrated response functions ( [ resps ] ) and ( [ respc ] ) were calculated for infinitesimal perturbations using the algorithm proposed in refs .  .",
    "this technique permits us to determine the two correlation functions and the two response functions in a single simulation of the unperturbed system .",

    "typically , in equilibrium simulations , the acceptance window for @xmath57 is chosen less than @xmath58 and dependent on temperature in order to optimize the updating procedure . since we are interested in studying a nonequilibrium process , for local phase changes we will use the full @xmath58 acceptance angle window for the new phases @xmath57 , following the criterion used in ref .  .",
