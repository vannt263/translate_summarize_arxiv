    "the top quark is the heaviest available fundamental particle in the standard model ( sm ) . because of the large mass of the top quark , it s interactions are an excellent probe of the electroweak symmetry - breaking mechanism , and they should therefore play an important role in the search of physics beyond the sm . for this purpose ,",
    "particularly , the anomalous interactions of the top quark can be examined by flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) . in the sm",
    ", fcnc decays @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) can not be observed at tree level , but these decays can only make loop contributions . as a result , such processes are anticipated to be enormously rare within the sm with branching ratios of an order of @xmath9 @xcite . however , various models beyond the sm such as the minimal supersymmetric model @xcite , two - higgs doublet model @xcite , the quark - singlet model @xcite , extra dimension models @xcite , the littlest higgs model @xcite , the topcolor - assisted technicolor model @xcite or supersymmetry @xcite could lead to a very large increase of fcnc processes involving the top quark .",
    "present experimental constraints at @xmath5 confidence level ( c. l. ) on the anomalous @xmath0 couplings are obtained from two limits : @xmath10 supplied by zeus collaboration @xcite and    @xmath11    presented by cdf collaboration @xcite .",
    "the fcnc anomalous interactions among the top quark , two quarks @xmath12 , @xmath13 and the photon can be written in a model independent way with dimension five effective lagrangian as follows @xcite    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the electromagnetic coupling constant , @xmath16 is the top quark electric charge , @xmath6 denotes the strength of the anomalous couplings of top quark with photon , @xmath17 is an effective cut - off scale which is conventionally set to the mass of the top quark @xcite , @xmath18 with @xmath19 which stands for the dirac matrix , and @xmath20 is the momentum of photon .    also , using the interaction lagrangian in eq.(@xmath21 ) , the anomalous decay width of the top quark can be easily obtained as follows    @xmath22    where the masses of @xmath12 and @xmath13 quarks are omitted in the above equation . since the dominant decay mode of the top quark is @xmath23 , the branching ratio of anomalous @xmath7 decay generally is given by the following formula :    @xmath24    therefore , using the equations ( @xmath25 ) and ( @xmath26 ) , we can obtain the magnitude of the upper limits of anomalous coupling provided by cdf collaboration as follows    @xmath27    in the literature , the interactions of the top quark via fcnc have been experimentally and theoretically examined @xcite .",
    "the lhc might allow us to observe the top quark s fcnc couplings with its high center - of - mass energy and high luminosity .",
    "however , the signal which may occur from the new physics beyond the sm is difficult to determine due to jets coming from proton remnants at the lhc . on the other hand , a linear lepton collider , which has extremely high luminosity and a clean experimental environment , can provide complementary information for these properties while carrying out high precision measurements that would complete the lhc results .",
    "one of the proposed high luminosity and high energy lepton colliders is the compact linear collider ( clic ) @xcite , which is designed to be constructed in three main stages as given in table i @xcite .",
    "the clic provides a suitable platform to examine the @xmath28 and @xmath29 processes by converting the incoming leptons into an intense beam of high - energy photons . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath4 processes at the clic occur instinctively by the virtual photon emitted from the original @xmath31 or @xmath32 beam",
    ". therefore , @xmath30 and @xmath33 processes are more realistic than @xmath28 and @xmath29 processes occurring through the compton backscattering mechanism .",
    "@xmath4 processes have been described by the weizsacker - williams approximation @xcite . in this approximation , the emitted photons are scattered at very small angles from the beam pipe . since the emitted photons have a low virtuality , they are almost real .",
    "@xmath34 processes can isolate the @xmath0 couplings from @xmath35 couplings .",
    "jets which originate from light quarks ( @xmath12 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 quarks ) differ from heavy quarks ( @xmath13 and @xmath38 quarks ) in the final state @xcite .",
    "therefore , the anomalous @xmath39 coupling could be distinguished from @xmath40 coupling via the process @xmath1 , if the anomalous coupling @xmath39 is not equal to @xmath40 . so far",
    ", new physics research through @xmath41 processes at the lep @xcite , tevatron @xcite and lhc @xcite have been experimentally studied in the literature . as a result , the clic as a @xmath4 collider provides us with an important opportunity to investigate the anomalous couplings of the top quark . a schematic diagram describing this process",
    "is represented in fig.@xmath25 .",
    "in the case of the effective lagrangian in eq.@xmath42 , the subprocess @xmath43 is described by four tree - level diagrams ( fig.@xmath21 ) . in our calculations , we perform the simulation program comphep-4.5.1 by including the new interaction vertices @xcite . in addition , the acceptance cuts were used as the following    @xmath44    @xmath45    where @xmath46 are the transverse momentum cuts of the @xmath38 and @xmath47 quarks , @xmath48 denotes pseudorapidity , and @xmath49 is the separation of the @xmath38 and @xmath47 quarks .",
    "the integrated total cross - sections of the process @xmath50 as a function of the anomalous couplings @xmath51 for @xmath52 and @xmath53 tev are plotted in fig.@xmath53 for @xmath54 gev@xmath55 .",
    "anomalous @xmath56 couplings are defined by effective lagrangian in eq.@xmath42 , and it has an energy dimension of @xmath57 . however , the total cross section including the sm and new physics has a higher energy dependence than the sm cross section .",
    "therefore , we can see from this figure that the total cross section increases with increasing the center - of - mass energy .",
    "on the other hand , there may occur an uncertainty arising from the virtuality of @xmath2 used in the weizsacker - williams approximation .",
    "we have obtained sm cross sections for various photon virtualities as follows : @xmath58 pb at @xmath59 tev and @xmath54 gev@xmath60 , @xmath61 pb at @xmath59 tev and @xmath62 gev@xmath60 , @xmath63 pb at @xmath64 tev and @xmath54 gev@xmath60 , @xmath65 pb at @xmath64 tev and @xmath62 gev@xmath60 , @xmath66 pb at @xmath67 tev and @xmath54 gev@xmath60 , @xmath68 pb at @xmath67 tev and @xmath62 gev@xmath60 for the process @xmath50 . in fig .",
    "@xmath26 , in detail , the integrated cross sections are given for different @xmath69 values as a function of @xmath70 .",
    "we can see from these figures the total cross section changes slightly with the variation of the @xmath69 value .    as shown in fig .",
    "@xmath57 , we plot the invariant mass distributions for the @xmath71 system in the final state , the signal has a peak over the sm background . in the sm",
    ", there is no single top quark production at tree level via the subprocess @xmath72 .",
    "hence , the differential cross section depending on the invariant mass distribution of the @xmath71 system is a good observable for the top quark s fcnc couplings . in fig.@xmath73 ,",
    "the rapidity distributions of the final state @xmath38 quark at the @xmath52 and @xmath53 tev .",
    "it can be understood that the rapidity distributions of the final state @xmath38 quark from the new physics signal and sm background are located generally in the range of @xmath74 . in fig.@xmath75 , the transverse momentum distributions of the final state @xmath38 quark at the @xmath52 and @xmath53 tev .",
    "we can see from fig.@xmath76 that the transverse momentum of the final state @xmath38 quark from the new physics signal and sm background can be discerned at especially large transverse momentum values .",
    "a comprehensive examination of the anomalous coupling @xmath6 requires a statistical analysis . in this work , we calculate sensitivity of the @xmath50 process to anomalous coupling @xmath6 using two different statistical analysis methods . first , we employ a one - parameter @xmath77 test when the number of sm events is greater than @xmath78 .",
    "the @xmath77 test without a systematic error is given by    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is the total cross section including sm and new physics , @xmath81 : @xmath82 is the number of sm events calculated as @xmath83 . here",
    "@xmath84 is the integrated luminosity , @xmath85 is the efficiency for @xmath38-tagging .",
    "we take into account the leptonic decay of the @xmath86 boson with the branching through @xmath87 , where @xmath88 .    in the second analysis , we use a poisson distribution , which is the appropriate sensitivity analysis for the number of sm events smaller than or equal to @xmath78 . in poisson analysis , the sensitivity limits are obtained assuming the number of observed events are equal to the sm prediction , i.e. ,    @xmath89    upper limits of the number of events @xmath90 at @xmath5 c.l .",
    "can be obtained as follows @xcite    @xmath91    the sensitivity limits on the anomalous coupling @xmath70 for different values of photon virtuality , center - of - mass energy and luminosity have been given in tables ii - iv .",
    "it has shown that the bounds on the anomalous coupling are slightly improved when @xmath69 increases .",
    "we can also understand that the large values of @xmath69 do not bring an important contribution to obtain sensitivity limits on the anomalous coupling at large energy and luminosity values . as shown in the tables",
    ", this process can develop the sensitivity limits of the anomalous coupling @xmath70 with respect to the current experimental limits .",
    "even though the lhc has high luminosity and high energy , it does not have clean environment due to the strong interactions",
    ". therefore linear colliders , which have less background than the lhc , provide an opportunity for precise measurements of the top quark anomalous couplings .",
    "photon - photon collisions at the linear colliders enable us to investigate fcnc top quark interactions without a contribution coming from the anomalous @xmath35 coupling .",
    "these processes may also be more efficient to distinguish @xmath39 and @xmath40 in comparison to hadron colliders due to the @xmath12 and @xmath13 quarks appearing in the final state .    in this paper",
    "we have analyzed the @xmath50 process with the anomalous @xmath56 couplings in a model independent effective lagrangian approach at the clic .",
    "so far , zeus and cdf collaborations have the most stringent limits on anomalous fcnc couplings of the photon with top quark . in our study",
    ", we present more restrictive limits with respect to the obtained anomalous couplings @xmath6 than the current experimental limits and these anomalous couplings depend strictly on the center - of - mass energy and integrated luminosity . consequently , the clic make an important contribution to the search for the anomalous @xmath56 couplings through the @xmath50 process .",
