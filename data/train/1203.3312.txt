    "we study random simplicial complexes in the @xmath0 model which was introduced in  @xcite and further studied in  @xcite .",

    "the parameter @xmath8 may ( and actually will usually ) be dependent on @xmath1 .",

    ". the main result of this paper is an upper bound on the threshold for the almost sure nonvanishing of @xmath13 for @xmath4 .",
    "this question was addressed in  @xcite and the present paper is , in many ways , a continuation of that paper .    to put this result in perspective",
    ", it may be useful to recall the situation for @xmath14 in which case @xmath0 coincides with the erds - rnyi @xmath15 model of random graphs .",
    "for every @xmath16 , a random graph from @xmath17 contains a cycle with some probability @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , the threshold for the appearance of a @xmath19-homology in @xmath20 is coarse .",
    "namely , the probability that the random graph from @xmath20 contains a cycle , jumps from a positive number to @xmath19 as @xmath21 changes from @xmath22 to @xmath19 .",
    "the behavior for dimension @xmath23 is similar .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath24 , the boundary of a @xmath25-simplex occurs with positive probability in @xmath26 for every @xmath27 .",
    "however , the situation in one dimension and in higher dimensions are quite different when we consider the size of the first occurring cycle .",
    "this issue is a little easier to discuss in the language of a random graph ( or complex ) process , where edges ( resp .",
    "@xmath2-faces ) are added at random one at a time . for graphs ,",
    "the length of the first generated cycle is distributed according to a certain known distribution  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the random @xmath2-dimensional complex process , it follows from  @xcite that the first emerging cycle in @xmath13 is either @xmath24 , or it has cardinality @xmath28 .",
    "we have conducted fairly extensive computer experiments with @xmath29 . in these experiments",
    "the situation was _ always _ that in the latter case , the first emerging cycle included _ all _ @xmath1 vertices . whether this can be proved and whether the same holds for general @xmath2 remains a subject for further study .",
    "the _ degree _ of a @xmath5-face in a @xmath2-dimensional complex is the number of @xmath2-faces that contain it .",
    "a @xmath5-face of degree zero , i.e. one that is contained in no @xmath2-face is said to be _",
    "isolated_. a @xmath5-face of degree @xmath19 is said to be _",
    "free_. the removal of a free @xmath5-face and the unique @xmath2-face that contains it is called an _ elementary collapse_. we recall  @xcite",
    "that an elementary collapse is a homotopy equivalence . given a complex @xmath6 ,",
    "we carry out a series of elementary collapses that take place in _",
    "phases_. at the beginning of a phase we list all @xmath5-faces in the complex which are currently free , and we scan them in an arbitrary order . as we arrive at a @xmath5-face @xmath30 in the list , one of two things can happen .",
    "it may still be free , in which case we apply to it an elementary collapse .",
    "it is also possible that when @xmath30 is reached , it is already isolated , since the unique @xmath2-face that initially contained it was already eliminated in a previous elementary collapse . in this case",
    "we simply skip @xmath30 . when we reach the end of the list , the current phase terminates and a new phase commences .",
    "we denote by @xmath31 the complex gotten from @xmath6 at the end of phase @xmath11 .",
    "in particular @xmath32 is just the randomly drawn complex with which we start .",
    "a @xmath2-face from @xmath33 is said to be in _ generation _",
    "a @xmath5-face is of _ generation _ @xmath11",
    "if its degree in @xmath34 is positive and it either does not belong to @xmath35 or is isolated there .",
    "[ mainth ] let @xmath36 be the unique positive root of the equation @xmath37 and let @xmath38 be defined as @xmath39    if @xmath40 , then a complex @xmath6 drawn from @xmath41 satisfies asymptotically almost surely @xmath42 specifically , @xmath43 .",
    "also @xmath44 and @xmath45 . for large @xmath2 @xmath46 and @xmath47 .    *",
    "note : * here are a few words about our experiments for @xmath29 .",
    "we run the random process in which a random @xmath48-face is added to the complex at each step .",

    "conditioned on the first cycle not being @xmath49 , the numerical estimates that we get for @xmath50 for @xmath51 are ( expectation @xmath52 standard deviation ) @xmath53 respectively .",
    "this lends some support to our belief that the bounds attained in theorem  [ mainth ] is the true value of the threshold probability .",
    "the general strategy of our proof is this : an elementary collapse is a homotopy equivalence and in particular it preserves the homology of the complex . using ideas similar to  @xcite we observe what happens as we systematically collapse ( in phases , as described above ) every free @xmath5-face .",
    "an elementary collapse eliminates exactly one @xmath5-face and one @xmath2-face .",
    "however , it also happens that a non - isolated @xmath5-face becomes isolated through collapses on other @xmath5-faces .",
    "we denote by @xmath54 the ( random ) set of such faces . also , let @xmath55 be the set of isolated @xmath5 faces in the original @xmath6 .",
    "finally let @xmath56 and let @xmath57 .",
    "observe that if @xmath58 , then @xmath59 .",
    "thus the main parts of the proof are these :    * local analysis of the collapsing process .",
    "* computing the expectation @xmath60 . * a measure - concentration argument on the random variable @xmath61 .",
    "our proof uses the fact that every @xmath5-face in @xmath62 corresponds to a zero row in the inclusion matrix of @xmath5-faces vs. @xmath2-faces ( after the collapses ) .",
    "there is another way of establishing the threshold , as done in the upper bound proof in @xcite .",
    "it is possible to associate to every @xmath5-face in @xmath62 a cocycle in @xmath63 and use the euler - poincar relation to give an upper bound on the threshold .",
    "indeed our proof can be viewed as an extension of the argument of @xcite .    as the reader has probably noticed",
    ", the above explanation says nothing about the parameter @xmath64 which plays a key role in the theorem .",
    "this is done in section  [ overview ] below , where we provide a more comprehensive overview of the proof .",
    "we analyze the sequence of @xmath2-complexes which are obtained , starting from @xmath6 and repeatedly collapsing , in phases .",
    "our analysis seeks to determine the way at which a given face @xmath66 of dimension @xmath5 or @xmath2 gets collapsed .",
    "note that @xmath66 s generation is completely determined by its local neighborhood in @xmath6 . concretely ,",
    "if @xmath66 is of generation @xmath67 , this can be ascertained by observing @xmath66 s radius-@xmath68 neighborhood . for every fixed @xmath67",
    "this neighborhood is almost surely a @xmath2-tree .",
    "we analyze the properties of this neighborhood using an intermediary  a galton - watson - like model of @xmath2-trees .",
    "this model is relatively easy to comprehend , and yet it provides a good approximation to the true local behavior of @xmath26 at the vicinity of @xmath66 .",
    "this general strategy has been used numerous times , and in particular in @xcite .",
    "we turn to provide the necessary definitions .",
    "we start with the ( recursive ) definition of a _",
    "@xmath2-tree_. a single @xmath2-face is a @xmath2-tree .",
    "a @xmath2-tree on @xmath69 vertices is obtained by taking a @xmath2-tree @xmath70 on @xmath1 vertices and adding to it a new @xmath2-face @xmath71 and its @xmath5-skeleton . here",
    "@xmath30 is a @xmath5-face of @xmath70 , and @xmath72 is a new vertex .",
    "a _ rooted @xmath2-tree _ is a @xmath2-tree in which we designate one @xmath5-face to be the root .",
    "associated with every @xmath2-complex @xmath73 is a graph @xmath74 whose vertices are the @xmath2-faces and the @xmath5-faces of @xmath73 .",
    "an edge between a @xmath2-face and a @xmath5-face stands for inclusion , and two @xmath5-faces are adjacent when they are contained in a @xmath2-face of @xmath73 .",
    "we freely apply to @xmath73 graph - theoretic notions from @xmath74 such as distance , diameter and radius from a vertex .",
    "thus the distance between two @xmath5-faces in @xmath73 is the distance of the two corresponding vertices in @xmath74 .",
    "we define a probability space @xmath65 of @xmath2-trees of radius @xmath75 from a @xmath5-face @xmath30 that is the root of the tree .",
    "thus @xmath76 is just the root @xmath5-face @xmath30 .",
    "for @xmath77 we sample a @xmath2-tree from @xmath65 as follows :    * sample a @xmath2-tree @xmath70 from @xmath78 .",
    "* for each @xmath5-face @xmath79 in @xmath70 at distance @xmath80 from @xmath30 * * sample an integer @xmath81 from the @xmath82 distribution . * * create @xmath81 new vertices @xmath83 and add @xmath81 new @xmath2-faces @xmath84 to @xmath70 for @xmath85 .    it is useful now to introduce a variation on the notion of the collapsing process .",
    "this is a process which we call _ @xmath79-collapsing _ , where @xmath79 is a @xmath5-face .",
    "this process is identical to the process of collapsing in phases , except that @xmath79 _ must not be collapsed _",
    ", even when it happens to be free .",
    "we analyze how a random @xmath2-tree @xmath86 behaves under the @xmath30-collapsing process where @xmath30 is the root of @xmath70 .",

    "let us calculate the numbers @xmath96 for small @xmath89 .",
    "clearly @xmath97 . also , @xmath98 is the event where @xmath70 consists only of its root @xmath30 , so that @xmath99    notice that @xmath30 , the root of a tree becomes isolated before the @xmath89-th phase iff each @xmath2-face @xmath100 satisfies the following condition .",
