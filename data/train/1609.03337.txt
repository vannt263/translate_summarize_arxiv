    "pathogen - host interactions ( phi ) are interactions that take place between pathogens ( e.g. virus , bacteria , etc . ) and their host ( e.g. humans , plants ) .",
    "pathogen - host interactions can be illustrated on a single - cell level ( individual encounters of pathogen and host ) , on a molecular level ( e.g. pathogenic protein binds to receptor on human cell ) , at the level of an organism ( e.g. virus infects host ) , or on the population level ( pathogen infections affecting a human population ) .",

    "we could list out 9 highly interacting hubs present in the human host that were involved with 786 pathogenic proteins .",
