    "chaotic phase synchronization ( cps ) associated with a locking of the phases of coupled chaotic systems corresponds to the case where the amplitudes are still uncorrelated .",
    "cps has been investigated in ensembles of globally coupled arrays @xcite , networks of oscillators @xcite , laser systems @xcite , cardiorespiratory systems @xcite , ecology @xcite , climatology @xcite , etc .",
    "cps is well studied and understood in low dimensional systems ; however , there exist a very little indepth studies in higher dimensional systems such as time - delay systems , which are essentially infinite - dimensional and exhibit highly non - phase - coherent hyperchaotic attractors with complex topological structures . so estimating the phase explicitly to identify phase synchronization in such systems is quite difficult .",
    "recently , the occurrence of phase synchronization in time - delay systems has been reported @xcite .",
    "however , these investigations are carried out so far only in a system of two coupled time - delay systems .",
    "very recently , the occurrence of global phase synchronization in a linear array of mackey - glass time - delay systems in the chaotic regime has been reported in suresh _ et al . , _ [ 2010 ] for open end boundary conditions .",
    "it has been shown that global phase synchronization occurs via a sequential type synchronization as the coupling strength increases . to verify the generic nature of the results of suresh _ et al . , _ [ 2010 ] , we consider in this paper two different piecewise linear time - delay systems with complex topological structures and investigate the occurrence of global phase synchronization along with the underlying mechanism for open end boundary conditions .",
    "in addition we consider the case of closed end boundary conditions ( ring topology ) and identify the occurrence of partial phase synchronization via cluster formation .",
    "specifically , in the first part of this paper , we investigate the generic nature of the phenomenon of global phase synchronization in an linear array , with free ends , of unidirectionally coupled ( i ) piecewise linear and ( ii ) threshold nonlinear time - delay systems in hyperchaotic regimes . in the second part , we report the phenomena of partial phase synchronizations in the array of above two systems but with closed end boundary conditions . at first",
    ", we use the nonlinear transformation introduced in senthilkumar _",
    "et al . , _ [ 2006 , 2008 ] to estimate the phase of all the systems in the array and to identify the existence of phase synchronization .",
    "further , we confirm the existence of global phase synchronization ( gps ) and partial phase synchronization ( pps ) from the original non - phase - coherent hyperchaotic attractors using two independent approaches , namely recurrence quantification analysis @xcite and the concept of localized sets @xcite .",
    "in addition , we point out that the onset of gps in the linear array with open end boundary conditions takes place in the form of a sequential synchronization ( second order transition ) : for lower values of coupling strength the phases of nearby systems get already entrained with the drive system in contrast to the far away systems , while the other non - synchronized systems display clusters of phase synchronized states among themselves before they become synchronized with the large cluster in the sequence as the strength of coupling increases to form the gps .    on the other hand ,",
    "if we consider an array with closed end boundary conditions ( ring topology ) , partial phase synchronization occurs with the formation of different groups of phase synchronized clusters .",
    "the oscillators in the array self - organize to form groups of phase synchronized clusters where each cluster is in perfect phase synchrony as a function of the coupling strength .",
    "such a clustering is considered to be particularly significant in biological systems @xcite , in electro - chemical oscillators @xcite , etc .",
    "recently , cluster synchronization in an array of three chaotic lasers without delay was reported @xcite as well . in our case , as the coupling strength increases , every individual system starts to drive the nearest system and the systems with small differences in their phases organize themselves to form small groups of clusters leaving the other oscillators with large phase differences to evolve independently .",
    "further increase in the coupling strength results in an increase in the sizes of the clusters due to the locking of the phases of the nearby oscillators of the clusters for appropriate values of the coupling strength and finally ending up with large groups of clusters resulting in pps ( first order transition ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in secs .",
    "[ sec : level2 ] and [ sec : level3 ] , we will describe briefly the coupling configuration and the occurrence of global phase synchronization in an array of two different piecewise linear time - delay systems with open end boundary conditions . in secs .",

    "identifying chaotic phase synchronization is a nontrivial problem in time - delay systems exhibiting complicated hyperchaotic attractors . for this purpose one",
    "requires appropriate measures . in this section , we describe briefly the various measures which we used from three different frameworks in this paper to estimate the phase of time - delay systems thereby facilitating the characterization of phase synchronization between the coupled time - delay systems .",
    "time - delay systems usually exhibit a highly complicated non - phase - coherent chaotic / hyperchaotic attractor with their flows having more than a single center of rotation .",
    "such an attractor does not yield a monotonically increasing phase on estimating it using the conventional techniques  @xcite . for this purpose ,",
    "we have introduced a nonlinear transformation to recast the original non - phase - coherent attractor into a smeared limit cycle - like attractor with a single center of rotation .",
    "our transformation is obtained by defining a new state variable @xcite , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the optimal value of time - delay to be chosen in order to avoid any additional center of rotation .",
    "then , the projected trajectory in the transformed state space ( @xmath4 ) will resemble that of a smeared limit cycle - like attractor .",
    "such an approach facilitates the estimation of phase from the conventional techniques .",
    "several measures of complexity quantifying the small scale structures in recurrence plots have been proposed and the corresponding description is known as recurrence quantification analysis ( rqa )  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the other advantages of the rqa such as its application to short experimental data , nonstationary and noisy data , we find that it can also be applied directly to highly complicated non - phase - coherent attractors of the time - delay systems in characterizing the synchronization transitions , in particular phase synchronization ( ps ) transitions . among the available recurrence quantification measures , we use the correlation of probability of recurrence ( cpr ) and the generalized autocorrelation function @xmath5 , which are estimated from the original non - phase - coherent hyperchaotic attractors , to confirm the existence of gps in the array of coupled time - delay systems , both qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "a criterion to quantify phase synchronization between two systems is the correlation of probability of recurrence ( cpr ) defined as @xmath6 where @xmath5 is the recurrence - based generalized autocorrelation function defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the heaviside function , @xmath9 is the @xmath10 data point of the system @xmath11 , @xmath12 is a predefined threshold , @xmath13 is the euclidean norm , and @xmath14 is the number of data points , @xmath15 means that the mean value has been subtracted and @xmath16 are the standard deviations of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "looking at the coincidence of the positions of the maxima of @xmath5 of the coupled systems , one can qualitatively identify ps  @xcite .",
    "if both systems are in cps , the probability of recurrence is maximal at the same time @xmath19 and cpr @xmath20 .",
    "if they are not in cps , the maxima do not occur simultaneously and hence one can expect a drift in both probabilities of recurrences resulting in low values of cpr .",
    "another measure that we have employed is the framework of localized sets  @xcite .",
    "the concept of localized sets opens up the possibility of an easy and an efficient way to detect cps especially in complicated non - phase - coherent attractors of time - delay systems .",
    "the main ingredient of this technique is to define an event in one of the systems and then observe the other during the event , which defines a set @xmath21 . depending upon the property of this set @xmath21 , one can state whether ps exists or not .",
    "the set is spread over the entire attractor for asynchronous systems , whereas it is localized on the attractor if the coupled systems are mutually phase - locked or in phase synchronous state .",
    "we use the above three different frameworks to confirm the existence of gps in an array of piecewise linear time - delay systems in the following .",
    "recently , we have reported the dynamical organization of an array of mackey - glass time - delay systems in chaotic regime to form global phase synchronization ( gps ) via sequential synchronization  @xcite , as mentioned in the introduction . in this section ,",
    "we intend to examine the generic nature of the results in ref .",
    "@xcite , by investigating the emergence of gps in an array of a particular type of piecewise linear time - delay systems from the local sequential synchronization as the coupling strength is increased from zero to that of the hyperchaotic regimes .",
    "it is worth to emphasize that the hyperchaotic attractors of the piecewise linear time - delay systems are characterized by much more complex topological properties than the chaotic attractor of the mackey - glass time - delay system studied in  @xcite and so is of considerable significance in estimating the onset of gps through sequential synchronization .",
