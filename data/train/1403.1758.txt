    "violation of cp occurs in the flavour sector . promoting cp to a symmetry at high energies which",
    "is then broken allows to impose further constraints on mass matrices of charged leptons and majorana neutrinos . in this case",
    "the interplay between cp and flavour symmetries has to be carefully discussed@xcite . for direct models , especially with a flavour group from @xmath1 , cp symmetries have not been studied in detail yet .    in this paper",
    "we examine a class of generalised cp ( gcp ) transformations consistent with @xmath1 groups for arbitrary @xmath4 .",
    "we will start by defining flavour and generalised cp transformations and stating their effect on mass matrices . in the following section we review and develop the general theory of gcp transformations in the presence of flavour symmetries in a general context .",
    "afterwards we specialise on direct models with @xmath1 as a flavour group , where we compute the lepton mixing matrix including majorana phases for arbitrary even @xmath4 for all possible breaking patterns of the flavour group and of gcp . here",
    "we also analyse the constraints from measurements of the mixing angles and from neutrinoless double - beta - decay on these models . in the last section we conclude .",

    "the three sigma ranges will shrink , perhaps making it possible to draw conclusions about @xmath132 and @xmath146 without an overly precise measurement of @xmath143 or of the mass of the lightes neutrino .",
    "to recapitulate , the following assumptions went into producing these results : there are 3 left - handed doublets of leptons , which in turn transform as a triplet under a @xmath1 group .",
    "the neutrinos are majorana fermions and @xmath1 is broken to a @xmath6 subgroup in the neutrino sector and to @xmath7 in the charged lepton sector .",
    "the mixing angles are solely predicted from the aforementioned assumptions .",
    "there is a generalised cp symmetry which is consistent with @xmath1 which is broken to one element in each sector . from this gcp symmetry",
    "the majorana phases are predicted .",
    "if one of the mixing angles would be found to be incompatible with any of the predictions this would mean that either @xmath1 is not broken to @xmath6 ( or to @xmath161 , as the predictions for the mixing angles would be the same ) or that the flavour group is not @xmath1 or that one of the more fundamental assumptions is wrong .",
    "the neutrinos could still be majorana fermions as @xmath1 could still be broken completely .",
    "in this paper we have examined the interplay of @xmath1 groups and generalised cp transformations ( gcp ) in a direct model for three generations of dirac charged leptons and majorana neutrinos .",
    "we find that gcp transformations that actually are physical cp transformations have @xmath162 .",
    "leaving a single gcp transformation unbroken will constrain the mixing matrix such that all phases , dirac and majorana are predicted and depend only on the @xmath1 group , the residual @xmath6 group ( parametrised by @xmath141 ) and the residual gcp transformation ( parametrised by @xmath163 ) in the neutrino sector . leaving two or more gcp transformations unbroken",
    "is not physically viable .    comparing the predictions for the mixing angles with experimental data",
    "we find that the strongest constraint on @xmath132 is imposed by the relatively precise measurement of @xmath138 .",
    "the smallest group where @xmath138 lies within three sigma of the central value has @xmath164 .",
    "furthermore , since the majorana cp violating phases are predicted , we have studied predictions for neutrinoless double - beta decay .",
    "we find that for inverted ordering , the predicted @xmath143 is within the reach of upcoming experiments like gerda iii . for normal",
    "ordering , measuring @xmath143 down to @xmath165ev could exclude large regions of @xmath132 and @xmath146 , depending on the value of @xmath166 .    in conclusion , this paper represents the first time that an infinite series of finite groups has been examined for generalised cp transformations that are consistent with it .",
    "we emphasise the important role of @xmath1 among the subgroups of @xmath167 with triplet irreducible representations and hope that this study will help to shed some light on the mystery of neutrino mixing .",
    "if the dirac cp phase is measured to differ from 0 or @xmath2 , or the mixing angles deviate from the sum rules @xmath168 , respectively , then this would mean that in general a potential flavour group @xmath1 can not be broken to @xmath6 , as in the case of the direct approach assumed here .",
