    "contagion processes such as infectious diseases , opinion formations , and information propagations , are ubiquitous in our networked society .",
    "network science has shown the profound impact that network structures give on such spreading behaviors @xcite .",
    "an epidemic can spread globally and infect a large number of individuals even if its infection rate is infinitesimally small , when the underlying network is highly heterogeneous @xcite ; such events can be described by simple infectious disease models , such as the susceptible - infected - removed ( sir ) model @xcite and the susceptible - infected - susceptible model @xcite .",
    "extensive studies @xcite on simple epidemic models in complex networks have developed accurate approximations with which the time evolution of epidemic spreading is well described @xcite , and they have discovered new phenomena owing to the complex structure of the networks , such as the localization of epidemics @xcite and the stretching of criticality @xcite . alongside these studies , a similar amount of effort has been devoted to contagion processes in social dynamics in order to recognize the effect of network connecting individuals on human behaviors , such as opinion formations and the propagation processes of information , innovations , and transient fads @xcite .",
    "social reinforcement , which means that an individual requires multiple prompts from neighbors before adopting information , has received attention in recent years .",
    "centola confirmed the effect of social reinforcement in individuals behavior through experiments on online social networks @xcite .",
    "after this , several social contagion models incorporating social reinforcement have been proposed @xcite .",
    "krapivsky et al .",
    "@xcite put forward a mathematical model for transient fads , which we call the fad model .",
    "the fad model is a variant of the sir model , in which intermediate states are added between the s and i states ( corresponding to uninformed and adopter in the fad context , respectively ) .",
    "this model was analyzed by the rate equation which assumes a well - mixed population ( i.e. , the mean - field approximation ) and it showed that its transition is explosive in the sense that , at a certain value of infection rate , the number of individuals that adopted information suddenly grows and the order parameter discontinuously jumps from zero to a non - zero value .",
    "we previously studied a discrete - time fad model in uncorrelated networks in order to confirm that discontinuous transition occurs when the network is not highly heterogeneous @xcite .",
    "similar discontinuous transitions have been reported in generalized epidemic models @xcite .",
    "very recently , the susceptible - weakened - infected - removed ( swir ) model , which is a variation of the sir model with an additional `` weakened '' state , has been studied @xcite .",
    "branching process analysis and numerical simulations have demonstrated that , in random graphs , a single infected node in this model can trigger an infinite avalanche of macroscopic order ; this indicates the existence of a discontinuous transition within appropriate model parameters .    in this paper",
    ", we study the swir model placed in a network , but assume that an epidemic starts from a finite fraction of initially infected nodes ( seeds ) .",
    "few studies have investigated the effect of initial conditions on sir - type epidemic models @xcite , although we have previously studied the sir model with a finite seed fraction in order to show that the critical infection rate , above which there is a giant cluster of r nodes in a network , crucially depends on the seed fraction @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "when this fraction is finite ( @xmath1 ) , each seed creates a cluster of r nodes and these clusters sometimes form a giant cluster by connecting with each other ; individuals seeds , however , do not have the potential to induce a global outbreak all by themselves . the critical infection rate of this sir model is , therefore , smaller than the so - called epidemic threshold . at rate above this threshold ,",
    "a single seed can spread through the network ; but as long as @xmath1 , it does not exhibit any singularities at the threshold .",
    "the aim of this paper is to observe what happens when @xmath0 for the swir model is finite .",
    "we perform monte carlo simulations for the swir model in a regular random graph ( rrg ) so as to show that the discontinuity of the order parameter holds for the present case , and that the model also exhibits an ordinary percolation transition at a smaller rate .",
    "we also investigate the swir model using approximate master equations ( ames ) @xcite in order to find that a discontinuous transition occurs if the degree of the underlying network is large and the seed fraction is small .",
    "let us consider the swir model in a static network with @xmath2 nodes .",
    "each node in the network takes one of the following four states : susceptible ( s ) , weakened ( w ) , infected ( i ) , or removed ( r ) . as an initial state of each trial ,",
    "a fraction , @xmath0 , of nodes is randomly chosen as seeds and is initially i , while other nodes are s. the system evolves as @xmath3 dynamics stop when i nodes no longer exist in the network .",
    "in other words , when only s , w , and r nodes remain .    the case where @xmath4 corresponds to an ordinary sir model , whose transition is a continuous one .",
    "the swir model shows a discontinuous transition when two additional processes ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) work effectively .",
    "lee et al .",
    "@xcite studied the time evolution of a giant cluster in an swir model in order to determine the mechanism causing explosive spreading to occur from a single seed .",
    "choi et al .",
    "@xcite investigated an swir model with a single seed and @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 in random graphs and found that the transition is rather mixed order ; what is meant by this is that an order parameter exhibits a discontinuous jump without any critical behavior while other physical quantities exhibit critical behaviors when the average degree is large . in our study",
    ", we consider an swir model with @xmath7 and @xmath10 , which corresponds to the fad model containing one intermediate state .",
    "when an s or w node is adjacent to an i node , this node becomes w or i , respectively , with probability @xmath11 within a short time @xmath12 .",
    "this probability is independently given by each of the i nodes , and so the total infection rate at an s or w node is proportional to the number of i neighbors .",
    "an i node becomes r at a rate @xmath13 irrespective of the neighbors states . without loss of generality , we set @xmath14 unless otherwise specified .    in the rest of this section ,",
    "we briefly review the sir model in an rrg in order to introduce the order parameter responsible for the characterization of the phase transition . when there is a single seed , or the fraction of infected seeds is infinitesimally small ( @xmath15 ) , the sir model undergoes a phase transition at the epidemic threshold , @xmath16 .",
    "let us consider the mean fraction of the outbreak size ( the number of r nodes ) , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 represents the average taken over all trials . in the limit @xmath19 , the system has two phases : ( i ) the local epidemic phase where @xmath20 for @xmath21 and ( ii ) the global epidemic phase where @xmath22 for @xmath23 . around @xmath24 ,",
    "the sir model exhibits typical critical behaviors with the same universality class as ( dynamic ) percolation @xcite .",
    "when the dynamics start from a finite fraction of i nodes , @xmath1 , the phase transition can be described in terms of percolation @xcite . connected components of r nodes",
    "are hereafter called r clusters . in the case of @xmath25",
    ", a final state will contain numerous r clusters .",
