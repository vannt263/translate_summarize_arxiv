    "a distinguishable feature of the chiral quark soliton model ( cqsm ) as compared with many other effective model of baryons , like the naive quark model or the mit bag model ( at least in its most primitive version ) , is that it is a field theoretical model which takes account not only of three valence quarks but also of infinitely many dirac sea - quark degrees of freedom @xcite,@xcite .",
    "as emphasized by diakonov in his recent review @xcite , this feature is essential in explaining the so - called `` nucleon spin crisis '' @xcite,@xcite as well as the quite large experimental value of the @xmath6 sigma term @xcite,@xcite : what he calls the two stumbling blocks of the naive quark models .",
    "in fact , the nucleon spin sum rule within the cqsm was first derived in @xcite .",
    "it was shown there that the sizable amount of the nucleon spin comes from the orbital angular momentum carried by dirac sea quarks .",
    "the way how the cqsm can explain the huge experimental value of @xmath7n sigma term is also very interesting .",
    "it predicts that only a small portion of the large @xmath7n sigma term is due to the main constituents of the nucleon , i.e. the three valence quarks , and the dominant contribution originates from the dirac sea quarks @xcite,@xcite .",
    "moreover , it was recently found that the dirac - sea contribution to the @xmath7n sigma term resides in a peculiar delta - function type singularity at @xmath8 in the chiral - odd twist-3 distribution function @xmath9 of the nucleon @xcite@xcite .",
    "also clarified there is that this delta - function singularity of @xmath9 is a rare manifestation of the nontrivial vacuum structure of qcd , characterized by the non - zero quark condensate , in a baryon observable .",
    "the superiority of the cqsm manifests even more drastically in high - energy observables .",
    "it is almost only one effective model that can give reliable predictions for the quark and antiquark distribution functions of the nucleon satisfying the fundamental field theoretical restrictions like the positivity of the antiquark distribution functions @xcite @xcite .",
    "coming back to the nucleon spin problem , we claim that the cqsm already gives one possible solution to it . the physical reason why this model predicts small quark spin fraction , or large orbital angular momentum is clear . it is connected with the basic nucleon picture of this model , i.e. `` rotating hedgehog '' .",
    "naturally , this unique nucleon picture takes over that of the skyrme model .",
    "immediately after the emc measurement , ellis , karliner and brodsky showed that this unique model predicts @xmath10 , i.e. vanishing quark spin fraction @xcite . an important difference between these two intimately connected models ( the skyrme model as an effective pion theory and the cqsm as an effective quark model )",
    "should not be overlooked , however . in the cqsm , @xmath11 receives small but definitely nonzero contribution from the three valence quarks forming the core of the nucleon .",
    "( another way to get @xmath12 is the generalization of the skyrme model so as to include the short range fields like the vector mesons @xcite . )    at any rate , an interesting solution to the nucleon spin puzzle , provided by the chiral soliton picture of the nucleon , emphasizes the importance of the orbital angular momentum of quark and antiquarks @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", there is another completely different scenario giving a possible solution to the nucleon spin puzzle .",
    "it claims that the small quark spin fraction is compensated by the large gluon polarization ( or the gluon orbital angular momentum . )",
    "which scenario is favored by nature is still an unsolved question , which must be answered by some experiments in the future .",
    "an experimental test of the first scenario has been thought to be an extremely difficult task , because the quark orbital angular momentum in the nucleon was not believed to be an experimentally observable quantity .",
    "the situation has changed drastically after ji s proposal @xcite@xcite .",
    "he showed that the quark total angular momentum and also the quark orbital angular momentum in the nucleon can in principle be extracted through the measurement of the deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) cross sections in combination with analyses of the standard inclusive reactions .",
    "the key quantity here is the unpolarized spin - flip generalized parton distribution function @xmath13 appearing in the dvcs cross section formula .",
    "especially interesting in the context of the above argument is its forward limit @xmath14 .",
    "it satisfies the following second moment sum rule : @xmath15 \\,d x = j^q , \\ ] ] which is widely known as ji s angular momentum sum rule @xcite-@xcite . here",
    "@xmath16 is the standard unpolarized quark ( and antiquark ) distribution function of flavor @xmath17 , while @xmath18 is the total angular momentum of quarks ( and antiquark ) with flavor @xmath17 .",
    "since @xmath16 is already well known , the new experimental knowledge of @xmath19 would completely determine @xmath18 . combining it with the available knowledge of the longitudinal quark polarization @xmath11 , together",
    "with the relation @xmath20 this opens up the possibility to extract the quark orbital angular momentum in the nucleon purely experimentally . very recently , ossmann et al .",
    "reported a very interesting calculation of @xmath21 , or more precisely the isoscalar combination @xmath22 , within the framework of the cqsm @xcite .",
    "they found that the contribution of dirac - sea quarks to @xmath22 dominates over that of the three valence quarks in the small @xmath23 region .",
    "especially interesting is their finding that the dirac - sea contribution to @xmath22 has an @xmath24 singularity around @xmath8 in the chiral limit . because of this peculiar feature",
    ", it turns out that the dirac - sea term gives negligible contribution to the first moment , i.e. @xmath25 d x$ ] , or equivalently to the isoscalar anomalous magnetic moment sum rule , while it gives a sizable contribution to the second moment sum rule , i.e. @xmath26 \\,d x$ ] , or to the quark angular momentum sum rule .",
    "they also investigated the second moment sum rule for @xmath22 within the cqsm , and confirmed that it reduces to the nucleon spin sum rule first derived in @xcite .",
    "this was an expected result , since , in the cqsm , any physical observables , including the nucleon spin , is saturated by the quark field alone , ( the quark intrinsic spin and the quark orbital angular momentum in the present case ) , and since it is already known that the model satisfies the energy momentum sum rule as well @xcite .",
    "although only the flavor singlet combination appears in the total nucleon spin sum rule , we also need the independent isovector combination @xmath27 , to make a flavor decomposition of the quark angular momentum .",
    "the isovector combination @xmath27 has already been addressed partially , but in an incomplete way @xcite@xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to carry out more complete investigation of this quantity .",
    "we shall show the results of exact numerical calculation of this quantity without recourse to the derivative expansion type approximation @xcite,@xcite .",
    "we also investigate the first and the second moment sum rule of @xmath27 , which is expected to give valuable information on the theoretical consistency of the model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect.ii ,",
    "we briefly summarize some basic properties of the unpolarized generalized parton distribution functions ( gpdf ) necessary for our later discussion .",
    "sect.iii is devoted to the theoretical analyses of the unpolarized gpdf based on the cqsm .",
    "the main concern here is the first and the second moments of the isovector spin - flip unpolarized gpdf @xmath28 , which we know has intimate connection with the nucleon isovector magnetic moment and the isovector combination of the quark spin fraction of the nucleon .",
    "next , in sect.iv , we shall present the cqsm predictions for the forward limit @xmath29 of the isovector spin - flip unpolarized gpdf .",
    "we also show the detailed numerical contents of the first and the second moment sum rules of this quantity .",
    "finally , we summarize our findings in sect.v .",
    "here , we briefly summarize some important features of the unpolarized quark generalized parton distribution functions @xmath30 and @xmath13 with flavor @xmath17 , which are necessary for later discussion .",
    "they are defined by @xmath31 here ( and hereafter ) we omit the light - cone gauge link , for brevity .",
    "we use the standard notation : @xmath32 with @xmath33 the light - like vector satisfying the relations . @xmath34",
    "it is a well known fact that the first moments of @xmath30 and @xmath13 reduce to the dirac and pauli form factors , respectively @xmath35 for convenience , we introduce the isoscalar and isovector combinations as follows : @xmath36 and similarly for @xmath37 and @xmath28 .",
    "( in the present paper , we neglect the strange quark degrees of freedom , and confine to the two flavor case . )",
    "the forward limit @xmath38 of the first moment sum rule then give @xmath39 here @xmath40 and @xmath41 stand for the anomalous magnetic moments of the @xmath42- and @xmath43-quarks , while @xmath44 and @xmath45 are those of the proton and neutron .",
    "the first moment sum rule of @xmath46 has especially interesting physical interpretation .",
    "namely , @xmath46 gives the distribution of the nucleon anomalous magnetic moments in the feynman momentum @xmath23 space not in the ordinary coordinate space .",
    "also noteworthy is the second moment sum rule given as @xmath47 which is known as ji s quark angular momentum sum rule @xcite-@xcite . here",
    ", @xmath48 represents the total quark ( spin and orbital angular momentum ) contribution to the nucleon spin . the forward limit of @xmath49 is known to reduce to the standard unpolarized distribution function , which is rather precisely known by now . on the other hand , the forward limit of @xmath50 is believed to be extracted from the analysis of the so - called deeply virtual compton scatterings on the nucleon target @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this means that the total quark angular momentum fraction of the nucleon spin can be determined purely experimentally .",
    "subtracting the known value of the quark intrinsic spin fraction @xmath51 of the nucleon .",
    "we can thus know the quark orbital angular momentum fraction of the total nucleon spin as well .",
    "furthermore , making a different flavor combination ( isovector combination ) from ( [ angsum0 ] ) , one expects another sum rule : @xmath52 thus , with combined use of the isoscalar and isovector sum rule , one would make a complete flavor decomposition of the quark total angular momentum .",
    "the theoretical expressions of @xmath53 and @xmath54 in the cqsm were already given in several previous papers @xcite@xcite,@xcite , so that we do not repeat the detailed derivation here .",
    "we describe only some main features and differences for the sake of later discussion . here",
    "we closely follow the notation in @xcite , and introduce the quantities @xmath55 the relations between these quantities and the generalized parton distribution functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 are obtained most conveniently in the breit frame .",
    "they are given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 these two independent combinations of @xmath58 and @xmath59 can be extracted through the spin projection of @xmath60 as @xcite,@xcite @xmath61 where `` @xmath62 '' denotes the trace over spin indices , while @xmath63 .",
    "now , the r.h.s . of ( [ hetrace ] ) and ( [ emtrace ] ) can be evaluated within the framework of the cqsm . here , we briefly describe the basic features of the cqsm leading to the theoretical expressions given below .",
    "the cqsm is a relativistic mean field theory with hedgehog assumption which breaks the rotation symmetry in addition to the translational symmetry at the mean field level .",
    "two zero - energy modes must be taken into account to recover these symmetries . to recover the translational invariance",
    ", we use an approximate method which projects on the nucleon state with given center - of - mass momentum @xmath64 by integrating out the shift @xmath65 of the soliton center - mass coordinate @xcite,@xcite : @xmath66 naturally , this procedure is justified only when the soliton is heavy enough and its center - of - mass motion is nonrelativistic .",
    "another zero - energy mode corresponds to the soliton rotational motion . as usual ,",
    "the velocity of this time - dependent rotation is assumed to be much slower than that of the intrinsic quark motions in the mean field @xcite,@xcite .",
    "this allows us to evaluate any nucleon observables in a perturbation theory with respect to the soliton rotational velocity @xmath67 .",
    "this then leads to the following general structure of the theoretical expressions for nucleon observables in the cqsm .",
    "the leading contribution just corresponds to the mean field prediction , which is independent of @xmath67 .",
    "the next - to - leading order term takes account of the linear response of the intrinsic quark motion to the rotational motion as an external perturbation , and consequently it is proportional to @xmath67 .",
    "here we confine ourselves to the mean field results @xmath68 contribution ) to the above gpdf .",
    "this leading term contributes to the isoscalar combination of @xmath69 , while it contributes to the isovector combination of @xmath70 : @xmath71 as shown by several previous papers , the first moments of the above gpdf reduce to the following forms @xcite-@xcite : @xmath72 here the symbol @xmath73 denotes the summation over the occupied ( the valence plus negative - energy dirac sea ) single - quark orbitals in the hedgehog mean field .",
    "these expressions are slightly different from the ones given in several previous studies @xcite-@xcite . in these studies , on the basis of the large @xmath74 argument , the l.h.s . of ( [ hecomb ] )",
    "is replaced by @xmath75 , while l.h.s . of ( [ emcomb ] ) by @xmath76 , since the remaining terms are subleasing in @xmath74 . here ,",
    "we retain these subleading terms because of the reason explained shortly . the r.h.s . of these equations",
    "are the known theoretical expressions of the sachs form factor and the isovector magnetic form factor within the cqsm , i.e. @xmath77 the reason why we did not drop the subleading terms @xmath74 in the l.h.s . of ( [ hecomb ] ) and ( [ emcomb ] )",
    "is as follows .",
    "if we did so , we would have obtained the relations @xmath78 which contradicts the first moment sum rule expected on the general ground , i.e. @xmath79 the first case would make little difference , because the difference between @xmath80 and @xmath81 is small under the circumstance in which the soliton center - of - mass motion is nonrelativistic .",
    "this is not the case with the difference between @xmath82 and @xmath83 , as seen from the experimentally known relations : @xmath84 although the anomalous magnetic moment term dominates over the dirac moment term both from the viewpoint of the @xmath74 counting as well as numerically .",
    "next , we consider the forward limit of ( [ gpdhe ] ) and ( [ gpdem ] )",
    ". the forward limit of ( [ gpdhe ] ) gives @xmath85 the r.h.s .",
    "precisely coincides with the expression of the isoscalar unpolarized quark distribution in the cqsm @xcite , i.e. we confirm that @xmath86 it is already known that the model expression for @xmath87 satisfies the quark number and the energy momentum sum rules @xcite,@xcite : @xmath88 the forward limit of ( [ gpdem ] ) reduces to @xmath89 the first moment of this quantity gives @xmath90 the r.h.s .",
    "precisely gives the theoretical expression for the isovector magnetic moment in the cqsm .",
    "( it is not the anomalous magnetic moment part . )",
    "this is basically a known fact @xcite , but what we emphasize here is that @xmath91 is interpreted to give the distribution of ( isovector ) nucleon magnetic moment in the feynman @xmath23 space not in the ordinary coordinate space .",
    "now , we turn to our main concern in this paper , i.e. the second moment of this quantity , which we expect is related to the isovector part of the quark angular momentum fraction of the nucleon . performing a weighted @xmath23 integral",
    ", we find that @xmath92 one notices that the second moment of @xmath91 can be decomposed into four parts as @xmath93 using the dirac equation ( here @xmath94 ) @xmath95 with @xmath96 the first term can be rewritten as @xmath97 it is easy to see that this term vanishes identically due to the hedgehog symmetry . alternatively",
    ", we can use the parity symmetry to show @xmath98 .",
    "the parity also enforces the fourth term @xmath99 to vanish .",
    "in fact , under the parity operation @xmath100 , we have @xmath101 with @xmath102 being the parity of the eigenstate @xmath103 , so that we conclude that @xmath104 the third term @xmath105 does not vanish but it can be simplified in the following way because of the hedgehog symmetry ( generalized spherical symmetry ) as : @xmath106 finally , the second term @xmath107 can be rewritten in the following manner by using the dirac equation , commutation relations of @xmath108-matrices and isospin matrices , and also the hedgehog symmetry : @xmath109 | n \\rangle .",

    "how should we interpret the above unexpected result for the isovector case ?",
    "one may argue that the second moment need not necessarily reduce to the nucleon matrix element of the free field angular momentum operator since the cqsm is anyhow an interacting theory of quark fields .",
    "in fact , the above derivation of the sum rule ( [ emiv2nd ] ) indicates that the cause of the @xmath117 term can be traced back to the dynamical generation of the effective quark mass and the formation of the symmetry breaking mean field containing the scalar product of @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "at least , one can say that , since the @xmath117 term is proportional to the dynamically generated quark mass @xmath120 , it vanishes in the perturbative vacuum , although it is meaningless to consider the chiral soliton if the qcd vacuum is perturbative .",
    "we recall that a similar breakdown of the second moment sum rule , expected on the general ground of qcd , occurs also in the case of chiral - odd twist-3 distribution functions @xmath9 of the nucleon . from the general qcd analysis ,",
    "one expect that the second moment of the isoscalar part of @xmath9 satisfies the following sum rule in the chiral limit @xcite , @xmath121 in the cqsm , however , we obtain @xcite,@xcite @xmath122 with @xmath123 .",
    "it is indicative that the violation of the qcd sum rule is again proportional to the dynamical quark mass @xmath120 , which would vanish in the perturbative vacuum @xcite .    from the practical viewpoint , only the l.h.s",
    ". of ( [ emiv2nd ] ) is observable , and neither of @xmath124 nor @xmath117 is observable . we therefore take the following viewpoint , although it is not absolutely mandatory .",
    "the second moment of @xmath125 gives the isovector quark angular momentum fraction of the interacting theory ( it is the cqsm in the present context ) : @xmath126 although somewhat arbitrary , this sum rule combined with ( [ emis2nd ] ) allows us to carry out the flavor decomposition of the quark angular momentum fraction in the nucleon . in any case ,",
    "the most important quantity here is @xmath91 , since it is the quantity which can be directly measured through the dvcs experiments . in the next section",
    ", we perform a numerical calculation of @xmath91 without recourse to the derivative expansion type approximation .",
    "we also evaluate @xmath124 and @xmath117 in the r.h.s . of ( [ emiv2nd ] ) directly without any notion of distribution functions .",
    "this allows us to check the validity of the sum rule ( [ emiv2nd ] ) within the model , thereby providing us with a nontrivial check for our numerical result for @xmath91 .",
    "the most important parameter of the cqsm is the dynamical quark mass @xmath120 , which plays the role of the quark - pion coupling constant , thereby controlling basic soliton properties @xcite,@xcite .",
    "here we use the value @xmath127 , which is favored from the analysis of nucleon low energy observables .",
    "the model is an effective theory which is defined with an physical cutoff .",
    "we use here the double - subtraction pauli - villars regularization scheme proposed in @xcite .",
    "( naturally , this is not the only way of introducing regularization .",
    "more sophisticated regularization scheme is proposed in @xcite . ) in this scheme , the most nucleon observables are regularized through the subtraction . @xmath128 here @xmath129 denotes the nucleon matrix element of an operator @xmath130 evaluated with the original action of the cqsm having the mass parameter @xmath120 , while @xmath131 stands for the corresponding matrix element obtained from @xmath129 by replacing the parameter @xmath120 with the pauli - villars cutoff mass @xmath132 . to remove all the ultraviolet divergences of the theory , the parameters @xmath133 and @xmath132 must satisfy the conditions : @xmath134 we further impose two additional physical conditions , which amounts to requiring that the model reproduces the empirically known value of the vacuum quark condensate as well as the correct normalization of the pion kinetic term in the corresponding bosonized action .",
    "this gives @xmath135 these four conditions ( [ pvcond1 ] ) , ( [ pvcond2 ] ) , ( [ pvcond3 ] ) and ( [ pvcond4 ] ) are enough to fix the four parameters @xmath136 and @xmath137 . fixing @xmath120 and @xmath138 to be 375mev and 93 mev , respectively , we find @xmath139 as usual , the numerical calculations in the cqsm are carried out by using kahana - ripka s discretized momentum basis @xcite,@xcite .",
    "our main task here is to evaluate @xmath91 given by ( [ emforwardocc ] ) making use of the kahana - ripka basis , which turns out not so easy .",
    "the cause of difficulty lies in the following fact .",
    "first , the appearance of the momentum operator @xmath140 in the delta function enforces us to work in the momentum representation . on the other hand ,",
    "the matrix element in ( [ emforwardocc ] ) contains the coordinate operator @xmath141 .",
    "this coordinate operator becomes a differential operator in the momentum representation , which is however incompatible with the whole calculation scheme of the cqsm making use of the discretized momentum basis . to circumvent this difficulty",
    ", we insert a complete set of states @xmath142 as follows : @xmath143 this complete set can in principle be chosen at will",
    ". it can be the eigenstates of the full dirac hamiltonian @xmath144 as the states @xmath103 are so , or it can be the eigenstates of the free dirac hamiltonian @xmath145 given by @xmath146 we choose here the latter . the grand spin @xmath147 of the states @xmath142 need not be the same as the grand spin @xmath148 of the states @xmath103 , but the finite rank nature of the operator @xmath149 restricts the value of @xmath147 to be @xmath148 , @xmath150 , or @xmath151 .",
    "the advantage of the expression ( [ compset ] ) is that the first and the second matrix elements can respectively be evaluated in the coordinate representation and the momentum representation .",
    "the theoretical expression for @xmath152 in ( [ emforwardocc ] ) is given as the summation over the occupied single - quark orbitals .",
    "an alternative but equivalent expression is obtained for it , which is given as the summation over the nonoccupied quark levels as @xmath153 the equivalence of these two representations is based on a quite general principle of field theory , i.e. the anticommuting property of two quark field operator with space - like separation .",
    "it is also known that the pauli - villars regularization preserves this equivalence . for numerical calculation of @xmath152",
    ", it is convenient to use the occupied form ( [ emforwardocc ] ) for @xmath154 , and the nonoccupied form ( [ emforwardnocc ] ) for @xmath155 .",

    "the sum of these two contributions is represented by the solid curve .",
    "a remarkable feature here is that the contribution of the dirac sea quarks has a sharp peak around @xmath8 .",
    "this confirms the qualitative result first given in @xcite . here",
    "we recall the fact that the @xmath23-integral or the first moment of @xmath156 gives the isovector magnetic moment @xmath157 of the nucleon .",
    "this denotes that @xmath91 gives the distribution of the nucleon isovector magnetic moment in the feynman @xmath23 space not in the ordinary coordinate space .",
    "the sharp peak around @xmath8 therefore means that the quark and antiquark with small @xmath23 carry a sizable amount of isovector magnetic moment of the nucleon .",
    "we interpret this fact as an indication of the importance of the quark motion in the transverse direction by the following reason .",
    "firstly , the isovector nucleon magnetic moment mainly comes from the quark and antiquark orbital motion in the nucleon , since it is known that the anomalous part dominate over the dirac moment part .",
    "secondly , the quark and antiquark with @xmath8 has zero velocity in the longitudinal direction .",
    "accordingly , the large magnetic moment density concentrated in the small @xmath23 region must come from the motion of quark and antiquarks in the plane perpendicular to the proton spin direction .",
    "the prominent peak of @xmath152 around @xmath2 can also be interpreted as the effect of pionic @xmath3 excitation with large spatial extension .",
    "in fact , it has long been known that the pion cloud around the `` bare '' nucleon gives a significant contribution to the isovector nucleon magnetic moment .",
    "this then indicates that the dominant contribution to @xmath152 in the small @xmath23 domain originates from the motion of correlated quarks and antiquarks , the spatial distribution of which have a long range tail in the transverse direction .",
    "the validity of the proposed interpretation may be tested more definitely , if one could evaluate the so - called impact - parameter dependent distribution function defined by @xcite @xcite . @xmath158    .",

    "we first discuss the first moment sum rule given by ( [ mom1st ] ) .",
    "the point is that both sides of this equation can be evaluated totally independently .",

    ", i.e. the isovector magnetic moment of the nucleon , has no trouble , since it is just a nucleon expectation value of a local operator .",
    "numerically , we have got @xmath159 while @xmath160 which coincides with the precision of about @xmath161 .",
    "one may notice that the theoretical prediction for @xmath162 is smaller than the experimental value @xmath163 .",
    "we however know that , within the framework of the cqsm , there is a rotational correction to @xmath162 proportional to the collective angular velocity @xmath67 , which is known to fill this gap @xcite,@xcite .",
    "( we should however recall some controversy related to this first order rotational correction to some isovector nucleon observables .",
    "@xcite @xcite . )",
    "this first order rotational correction is naturally expected to contribute also to @xmath164 , thereby to both side of the first moment sum rule .",
    "the calculation of such a higher order contribution to @xmath164 is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "next we turn to the second moment sum rule of @xmath91 given by ( [ emiv2nd ] ) .",
    "we first evaluate the first term of the r.h.s . of ( [ emiv2nd ] ) ,",
    "i.e. the nucleon matrix element of the free field angular momentum operator in the isovector combination .",
    "this term consists of the two terms as @xmath165 here , @xmath166 is the nucleon matrix element of the free field isovector angular momentum operator , while @xmath167 is the isovector part of the longitudinal quark polarization .",

    "knowing that the second moment of @xmath91 does not coincide with the nucleon matrix element of the free field quark angular momentum operator in the isovector case , we would rather take a viewpoint that its second moment gives the quark angular momentum in the interacting theory .",
    "this amounts to regarding the sum of @xmath124 and @xmath117 as the isovector part of the quark angular momentum fraction @xmath171 of the interacting theory , which gives @xmath172 the corresponding quark orbital angular momentum fraction can be estimated by subtracting the corresponding quark spin part @xmath173 , which gives @xmath174 worthy of mention here is the @xmath23-distribution of the isovector quark angular momentum . pushing forward with the above interpretation ,",
    "let us identify @xmath175 with the isovector quark angular momentum distribution @xmath176 .    .",
    "the meaning of the curves is the same as in fig.[fig : gpdf].,width=415,height=359 ]    shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xgpdf ] is the cqsm prediction for this quantity @xmath175 , or @xmath177 in the above interpretation . here",
    ", the distribution in the negative region should be interpreted as that of antiquarks , i.e. @xmath178 with @xmath154 .",
    "then , we observe from this figure that @xmath179 while @xmath180 the first inequality is nothing surprising , since the proton contains two @xmath42-quarks and one @xmath43-quark as valence particles .",
    "more interesting here is the second inequality , which indicates that the @xmath4-quark carries more angular momentum than the @xmath5-quark in the proton .",
    "this reminds us of the violation of the gottfried sum rule , which has been accepted by now as a clear evidence of the dominance of the @xmath4-quark over the @xmath5-quark in the unpolarized parton distribution functions of the proton .",
    "undoubtedly , the two physics can not be completely unrelated .",
    "to conclude , we have given a theoretical prediction for the forward limit of the isovector , spin flip generalized parton distribution function @xmath76 of the nucleon on the basis of the cqsm .",
    "it has been shown that the distribution function @xmath181 has a sharp peak around @xmath8 generated by the vacuum polarization of the dirac sea quark . in view of the fact that the function @xmath91 gives the distribution of the nucleon isovector magnetic moment in the feynman momentum @xmath23 space",
    ", we interpret this sharp peak around @xmath8 as an indication of the importance of the pionic @xmath3 excitation with large spatial extension in the transverse direction .",
    "somewhat unexpectedly , we found that the second moment of @xmath91 does not reduce to the proton matrix element of the free quark angular momentum operator , but receive a peculiar correction term .",
    "the cause of this correction term seems to be traced back to the nonperturbative formation of isospin dependent hedgehog mean field .",
    "still , we advocate a viewpoint that the second moment of @xmath91 gives the isovector quark angular momentum fraction of an interacting theory , which leads us to an interpretation of @xmath182 as the isovector quark ( and antiquark ) angular momentum distribution .",
    "this then indicates that the @xmath4-quark carries more angular momentum than the @xmath5-quark inside the proton ."
