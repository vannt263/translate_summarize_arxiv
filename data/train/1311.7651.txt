    " _ as far as i can see , all a priori statements in physics have their origin in symmetry _ \" , said hermann weyl @xcite .",
    "symmetries play a paramount role in physics .",
    "they dictate the fundamental possibilities in a physical model , including important features such as conservation laws , the nature of interactions , and selection rules for physical processes .",
    "the search for new symmetries - and their destruction - thus forms a powerful guiding principle in the quest to understand nature @xcite .",
    "last , but not least , the presence of symmetry adds to the aesthetic appeal of a physical model and enhances its beauty .    in typical introductory courses at the undergraduate @xcite and graduate @xcite levels , symmetries are introduced as transformations that leave the hamiltonian of a system unchanged .",
    "mathematically , they are represented by operators that commute with the hamiltonian .",
    "some common examples include symmetries under the operations of translation , rotation , and inversion of spatial coordinates .",
    "system invariance under these symmetries implies the existence of conserved quantities , such as linear momentum , angular momentum , and parity , respectively .",
    "the conservation of such physical quantities inevitably simplifies , and often makes analytically solvable , the spectrum of the hamiltonian and the time evolution of the system @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we consider symmetries that are represented by operators that _ anticommute _ with the system hamiltonian .",
    "these ` chiral ' symmetries correspond to objects that are mirror images of each other .",
    "the best known example of chiral symmetry is perhaps the case of the relativistic electron , where the charge conjugation operator anticommutes with the dirac hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "another example from advanced textbooks is the bogoliubov - de gennes hamiltonian in superconductivity @xcite .",
    "yet more specialized instances can be found in the research literature @xcite .",
    "recently , we analytically solved an effective hamiltonian for the oh molecule by exploiting the presence of chiral symmetry @xcite .    while the existence of these symmetries can not be associated with conserved quantities",
    ", they do simplify , and sometimes render analytically solvable , the spectrum of the corresponding hamiltonian .",
    "they also impose a rather pleasing pattern on the energy spectrum , which students of physics may find appealing . in the present work",
    "we show that chiral symmetries can be readily introduced and elaborated on at both the undergraduate and graduate levels , by simply using the theory of angular momentum , which is taught in every introductory quantum mechanics course @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : commute ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath4 implying that the transformation under the symmetry operation @xmath0 leaves the hamiltonian unchanged .",
    "the existence of such a symmetry usually also implies the presence of degeneracy in the spectrum of the hamiltonian @xmath1 , and often plays a crucial role in rendering the hamiltonian analytically solvable .",
    "a familiar example is that of the hydrogen atom , whose solvability relies partially on its invariance under rotations in three - dimensional space , which in turn leads to the conservation of angular momentum @xcite .",
    "an operator @xmath5 which anticommutes with the system hamiltonian , i.e. @xmath6 is said to correspond to a _",
    "the existence of such an operator implies that the spectrum of the hamiltonian consists of pairs of states with energies of equal magnitude , but opposite sign .",
    "this can be seen readily by considering an eigenstate @xmath7 of @xmath1 with eigenvalue @xmath8 , @xmath9 multiplying both sides of eq .",

    "( [ eq : anticommute ] ) leads to @xmath10 this implies that @xmath11 is an eigenstate of the hamiltonian with eigenvalue @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the existence of the operator @xmath5 and its anticommutation with @xmath1 imply the presence of paired energy levels @xmath13 in the spectrum as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sp1 ] below .",
    "this phenomenon explains the term ` chiral ' symmetry since chiral comes from the greek word for hand .",
    "just like our left and right hand are mirror images of each other , the chiral pair in a spectrum consists of the group of positive and the group of negative energy states .",
    "these two groups are not identical , but are mirror images of each other across the zero - energy axis .      the eigenvalues of a hamiltonian can be found by solving the equation @xmath14 , where @xmath1 is the hamiltonian , @xmath15 the eigenvalue , and @xmath16 the unit matrix .",
    "this relation can be rewritten slightly by using the characteristic polynomial , @xmath17 and solving @xmath18 for @xmath15 .",
    "the analytical solubility of a finite - dimensional hermitian matrix @xmath1 will generally depend on the dimension of the matrix . from the abel - ruffini theorem it is known that _ generally _ only the characteristic polynomials of hermitian matrices of dimension four or less can be solved using radicals @xcite , while those of dimension five can be solved using hypergeometric functions @xcite .",
    "polynomials of degrees higher than six are generally analytically unsolvable .",
    "let us assume that the dimension of the hamiltonian matrix is @xmath19 .",
    "the characteristic polynomial @xmath20 of the matrix @xmath1 is therefore also of degree @xmath19 in the variable @xmath15 , the eigenvalue .",
    "however , since the eigenvalues come in pairs for chiral symmetry , if @xmath21 it follows that @xmath22 also .",
    "thus , @xmath20 must be even in @xmath15 , unless @xmath23 is a solution , in which case it can be factored out .",
    "@xmath20 can therefore be expressed as a polynomial of degree @xmath24 in the variable @xmath25 if @xmath26 then the spectrum can be obtained analytically .",
    "this implies that chiral symmetry can enable the direct solution of even - dimensional hamiltonian matrices of dimension up to @xmath27 if the dimension of @xmath1 is odd , then there must be a zero energy state , which can be factored out of @xmath20 , leaving an even - dimensional polynomial whose roots can be found analytically .",
    "specific examples will be provided below .",

    "we consider a total angular momentum operator @xmath28 with components @xmath29 such that @xmath30      the commutation relations obeyed by the components of the angular momentum are given by @xcite @xmath31=i\\hbar j_{z } , \\ , [ j_{y},j_{z}]=i\\hbar j_{x},\\ , [ j_{z},j_{x}]=i\\hbar j_{y}.\\ ] ] further , @xmath32=[j^{2},j_{y}]=[j^{2},j_{z}]=0.\\ ] ] a convenient basis is @xmath33 , where the eigenvalue @xmath34 is related to the magnitude of the total angular momentum , @xmath35 and the eigenvalue @xmath36 @xmath37 is the projection of the angular momentum vector onto a quantization axis .",

    "( [ eq : anticommute ] ) we know that the key to identifying chiral symmetry for a given hamiltonian is to find a matrix that anticommutes with it .",
    "mathematically , eq .  ( [ eq : rot : anticom ] ) thus implies chiral symmetry and sets the general strategy for the specific examples given in the following section .",
    "physically , eq .  ( [ eq : rot : anticom ] ) is an example of the fact that a rotating object and its counter - rotating version are mirror - images of each other .",
    "our first physical example is a single spin in two crossed magnetic fields oriented along the @xmath62- and @xmath63-directions , respectively .",
    "its hamiltonian is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are constants .",

    "( [ eq : rot ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath1 anticommutes with the operator @xmath69 , @xmath70    to illustrate this explicitly , let us consider the case of a single electron in two crossed magnetic fields , i.e. @xmath71 . in that case the angular momentum operators can be written in terms of the pauli matrices , i.e. @xmath72 @xmath73 and @xmath74    using these matrices , eq .",

    "we also note that the addition of odd powers such as @xmath86 to @xmath87 will not destroy its chiral symmetry , while the addition of even powers such as @xmath88 will generally remove such a symmetry .",
    "this is because the rotation @xmath69 anticommutes with the odd powers , but not with the even powers .",

    "another interesting physical example is the atomic nucleus which can be modeled as a spin that is allowed to rotate about all three axes with moments of inertia @xmath118 , respectively @xcite .",
    "it can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath119 it may seem that there can not be chiral symmetry in this case as @xmath120 is even in all components of the angular momentum .",
    "however , chiral symmetry can exist for some special values of the moments of inertia .",
    "it is important to note that using eq .",

    "( [ eq : h22 ] ) , we may write the shifted hamiltonian @xmath126 a little thought reveals that this hamiltonian has chiral symmetry , since a rotation by @xmath127 about the @xmath49 axis changes @xmath128 and @xmath129 see fig .  [",
    "fig : rot ] . since this transformation exchanges the @xmath62 and @xmath63 labels on the angular momentum components in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h2p ] ) , it reverses the sign of @xmath130 .",
    "indeed , @xmath131    this example shows that in order for chiral symmetry to be present in a system , it is not necessary that each individual term in the hamiltonian be chiral symmetric .",
    "finally , we will consider a system of two coupled spins of angular momenta @xmath132 and @xmath133 , respectively . finding the rotations that anticommute with the hamiltonian becomes only a little more complicated .",
    "we will first present a toy model to illustrate the method .",
    "then we will discuss a real system , namely the ground state oh molecule in combined electric and magnetic fields , that we have recently solved analytically @xcite .",
    "let us consider the toy hamiltonian @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 are constants .",
    "this hamiltonian describes two spins that are coupled along the @xmath63 and @xmath49 directions , but not along @xmath62 . since we are now considering two spins",
    ", the anticommuting rotation operator must be a product of rotation operators of the individual spins .",
    "also , these operators can not correspond to rotations about the same axis , as then each term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h3 ] ) would pick up two negative signs , one from each spin , and would overall remain unchanged .",
    "thus , we must consider rotating each spin about a different axis .",
    "after some tinkering we find that the correct rotation operator that anticommutes with @xmath137 is given by @xmath138 this operator rotates the first spin by @xmath67 about the @xmath63 axis and the second spin about the @xmath49 axis by the same angle .",
    "looking at the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h3 ] ) , we see that @xmath139 leaves the first spin unchanged but rotates the second spin by @xmath67 about the @xmath49 axis .",
    "thus , it anticommutes with @xmath140 and thus with the full first term in eq .",

    "similar reasoning shows that @xmath141 anticommutes with the second term as well .",
    "thus , @xmath142      consider now a hamiltonian that describes the ground state oh molecule in combined electric and magnetic fields @xcite @xmath143 where @xmath144 and @xmath48 are constants related to the internal structure of the molecule , the magnetic field , the electric field and the angle between the two fields , respectively .",
    "for the oh molecule @xmath145 and @xmath146 an appropriate basis in that case can be constructed from the product states @xmath147 where @xmath148 takes values @xmath149 and @xmath150 takes values @xmath151 .",

    "( [ eq : oh ] ) contain spins that are coupled along the @xmath49 direction .",
    "thus , in order to change the sign of the first or the second term , we need to rotate the first or second spin by @xmath67 about either the @xmath62 or the @xmath63 axis .",
    "however , this means that @xmath157 in the third term will also change sign .",
    "thus , we should rotate the second spin in such a way that @xmath158 changes sign as well .",
    "this can be accomplished by picking the rotation operator @xmath159 now we need to ensure that the @xmath160 does _ not _ change sign as @xmath161 reverses .",
    "this can be done by choosing the rotation operator @xmath162 .",
    "thus , our final rotation operator is given by @xmath163 such that @xmath164 the matrix representation of the hamiltonian @xmath165 is of dimension @xmath166 chiral symmetry reduces this effectively to a quartic , making it exactly solvable .",
    "the analytic expressions for the energy eigenvalues can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    before we conclude , we would like to note that since the angular momentum operators are hermitian , rotation operators are unitary .",
    "the inverse @xmath167 of a rotation operator @xmath168 is given by its hermitian conjugate , and is well - defined .",
    "in this case , the anticommutation @xmath169 can be rephrased as @xmath170 which contrasts nicely with eq .",
    "( [ eq : invar ] ) .",
    "however , rather than start with this similarity transformation , we have chosen to make the anticommutation relation as our fundamental requirement for the presence of chiral symmetry .",
    "this was done to keep the discussion general .",
    "specifically , our approach includes operators which anticommute with the hamiltonian but whose inverse may not exist .",
    "as we have shown , chiral symmetry of a hamiltonian implies reflection symmetry in the spectrum .",
    "one may think of this reflection symmetry as a rotation of the spectrum itself by @xmath67 .",
    "but what if a spectrum returns to itself when rotated by @xmath171 where @xmath172 is an integer ?",
    "this more general kind of rotational symmetry has been addressed mathematically by the perron - frobenius theorem @xcite .",
    "however , this theorem applies only to matrices whose elements are all non - negative . it may be verified readily that matrices representing angular momentum operators do not fall in this category .",
    "in this article we have shown that chiral symmetries can be accessibly incorporated in undergraduate and graduate quantum mechanics courses using the basic theory of angular momentum .",
