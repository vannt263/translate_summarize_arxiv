    "the x - ray pulsar xte j1810@xmath0197 was discovered ( ibrahim et al .",
    "2004 ) in 2003 when it suddenly brightened to more than 100 times its quiescent value ( halpern & gotthelf 2005 ) during an outburst .",
    "the source showed a steady decline of its x - ray flux thereafter , accompanied by significant spectral changes ( gotthelf & halpern 2006 ) .",
    "the 5.54  s period of the source , as well as the large period derivative @xmath3  s  s@xmath4 were established ( ibrahim et al .",
    "2004 ) , confirming the source as an anomalous x - ray pulsar ( axp ) .",
    "the detection of characteristic x - ray bursts ( woods et al .",
    "2005 ) , similar to those seen in other axps ( gavriil , kaspi , & woods 2002 , 2006 ) , further strengthened this classification .",
    "xte j1810@xmath0197 resides on one extreme of the diverse spectrum of variability properties observed from axps .",
    "these span at least four types of different activity in pulsed and persistent emission , ranging from the short - lived energetic bursts to outbursts that are characterized by sudden increases and subsequent long - timescale decays in the persistent flux ( kaspi 2006 ) .",
    "moreover , xte j1810@xmath0197 is also unique in its unusually low quiescent flux levels that have been determined from archival xte and rosat data ( gotthelf & halpern 2006 ) , almost two orders of magnitude fainter than the other known axps , earning it the title of the transient axp .    as with the x - ray spectra of the other known axps , the spectra of xte j1810@xmath5",
    "have so far been analyzed by fitting empirical functions such as two blackbodies or a blackbody plus a power - law to the data ( gotthelf & halpern 2005 ) .",
    "such analyses are typically used for providing a rough estimate of the surface temperature of axps , even though neutron star surfaces do not emit like blackbodies .",
    "the photon energy - dependent radiation processes in their atmospheres strongly distort the emission originating deep in the neutron stars away from a blackbody spectrum ( see , e.g. , shibanov et al .",
    "the strong magnetic fields that the sources are thought to possess , based on the rapid spindowns ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "1998 ) , also leave distinctive imprints on the spectra both by altering the radiation processes in their atmospheres ( zel 2003 ) and by giving rise to moderate scattering optical depths in the magnetospheres ( thompson , lyutikov , & kulkarni 2002 ) .    in this letter",
    ", we analyze the spectra of xte j1810@xmath0197 for the first time with a physical model that incorporates emission from the magnetar surface and its reprocessing in the magnetosphere , as described in gver , zel , & lyutikov ( 2006 ) . unlike empirical fits",
    ", we account for the known radiative processes that take place on and around a magnetar for a range of magnetic field strengths and surface temperatures and base our analysis on the resulting set of models .",
    "the fits , therefore , can yield the physical parameters of the source .",
    "conversely , successfully reproducing in detail the spectral characteristics of every epoch with a single physical model , while keeping consistent values for these parameters , would indicate that this model captures all the relevant physical effects that take place on a magnetar and is thus a validation of the theoretical model .",
    "we choose xte j1810@xmath0197 a prime candidate for this detailed study , because it has gone through extreme variations in its x - ray flux and spectrum over its short lifetime and , thus , it is not a priori obvious that such a wide range of spectra can be fit with a model that depends only on four physical parameters .",
    "we describe our physical model in section 2 and present the data analysis and results for xte j1810@xmath0197 in section 3 . in section 4 , we discuss the implications of the spectroscopically determined magnetic field strength and conclude with a discussion of the mechanism responsible for the outburst of the transient magnetar based on the results of our analysis .",
    "we base our spectral analysis on the physical model of magnetars that we have developed ( gver et al .",
    "2006 ) , which for the first time takes into account the relevant mechanisms that take place both on the atmosphere and in the magnetosphere of a magnetar .",
    "the _ surface thermal emission and magnetospheric scattering _ model ( stems ) depends only on four physical parameters that describe the surface magnetic field strength and temperature of the neutron star , as well as the density and the energetics of charges in its magnetosphere .    in our detailed calculations ,",
    "we address the polarization - mode dependent transport of radiation , treating absorption , emission , and scattering processes that take place in the fully ionized plasmas of hot ( @xmath6  kev ) magnetar atmospheres ( zel 2003 ) .",
    "the model also incorporates the interaction of photons with the protons in the plasma that gives rise to absorption features at the proton cyclotron energy .",
    "furthermore , we fully calculate the effects of vacuum polarization resonance , which leads to an enhanced conversion between photons of different polarization modes as they propagate outward through the atmosphere .",
    "we have calculated spectra spanning the range of surface magnetic field strengths @xmath7  g and surface temperatures @xmath8  kev , in line with the physical processes incorporated into the calculations .    in the stellar magnetospheres ,",
    "we include a treatment of resonant scattering ( gver , zel , & lyutikov 2006 ) .",
    "the enhanced current density in the magnetosphere of a magnetar significantly increases the optical depth to electron scattering experienced by the outgoing atmospheric photons ( thompson et al .",
    "the resulting upscattering modifies both the high - energy continuum and the equivalent widths of the proton cyclotron absorption features ( lyutikov & gavriil , 2006 ; gver et al . , 2006 ) .    finally ,",
    "because the surface photons originate in the strong gravitational field of the neutron star , we follow the general relativistic propagation of the photons to an observer on earth .",
    "this last step depends on the mass - to - radius ratio of the neutron star ( for which we assume a fixed fiducial value of @xmath9 ) and is necessary to make the physical models directly comparable to the observations of axps . here ,",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 are the mass and radius of the neutron star , respectively , given in gravitational units .    in order to compare",
    "observed x - ray spectra with the stems model , we numerically calculated model x - ray spectra ( in the 0.05 - 8.12 kev range ) and created a table model which can be used within xspec ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "xte j1810@xmath0197 was observed for a total of 170 ks in seven pointings between august 9 , 2003 and march 12 , 2006 with epic - pn onboard xmm - newton . during these observations , the unabsorbed @xmath12  kev flux of the source varied from 57.96@xmath13  erg  s@xmath4  @xmath14 at its peak to 4.17@xmath13  erg  s@xmath4@xmath14 during the last observation .",
    "fast read out of epic - pn cameras and decreasing flux of the source with time ensures that the spectra were not affected by photon pile - up in any of the observations .",
    "we calibrated all observations using the science analysis software ( sas , v. 7.0.0 ) and the latest ( january 2007 ) available calibration files .",
    "we eliminated the segments of data which were highly affected by high - energy particle background .",
    "we grouped all the spectra before background subtraction so that each spectral bin has at least 25 counts .",
    "we then fit the spectra , using xspec v11.3.2 , with the stems model we discussed above .",
    "we allowed for interstellar extinction from a cold medium with cosmic abundances .",
    "figure  1 shows the spectra observed in the seven different epochs , the best fit models , and the residuals .",
    "the model describes in detail the salient features of the spectra in the entire energy range .",
    "this is especially remarkable because the significant evolution of the spectra during the decay of the outburst can be fit with a single physical model .",
    "the @xmath15d.o.f . for the spectral fits ,",
    "in order of decreasing source flux are 1.07/732 , 0.95/548 , 1.11/820 , 1.12/772 , 1.21/653 , 1.02/423 , 1.02/302 . even more compelling than the low @xmath16 values",
    "is the flatness of residuals that demonstrate the ability of the model to reproduce the observations without the need for any additional ad hoc components such as a blackbody or a power - law function .    in the analyses of all seven observations",
    ", we obtain a nearly constant value of @xmath17  @xmath14 for the equivalent hydrogen column density responsible for the interstellar extinction , even though we allow this parameter to vary between observations .",
    "this value is also in agreement with an independent study of this source ( gotthelf & halpern 2006 ) . the scattering optical depth @xmath18 and the velocity distribution @xmath19 of the electrons in the magnetosphere also remain fairly constant , around values @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "these results show that there is no significant variation in the magnetosphere of the source during the window of the xmm-_newton _ observations .",
    "if the onset of the outburst introduced any magnetospheric changes , these must have stabilized within the months between the peak of the outburst and the first xmm-_newton _ observation .",
    "our analysis of the 0.5 - 7  kev spectra of xte j1810@xmath0197 with the stems model allows for a tight and unique constraint of the magnetic field strength of the source .",
    "the best - fit values for the surface magnetic field and the surface temperature of the neutron star , obtained from the detailed fits , as well as the 1- and 2-sigma confidence limits are shown in figure  2 .",
    "the magnetic field strength ranges from @xmath22  g in the earliest observation to @xmath23  g in the last one , while the temperature declines from @xmath24  kev to @xmath25  kev in the same interval .",
    "note that for the last two observations which have very low flux levels and poorer statistics , the confidence contours were drawn by freezing the other model parameters . for comparison",
    ", we also obtained the value of the magnetic field strength from fitting all the data sets simultaneously , which yields @xmath26  g.    the confidence contours show that the magnetic field can be tightly constrained in each observation .",
    "this is because of the presence of significant broad features in the magnetar spectra imparted by weakened proton cyclotron lines and the vacuum polarization resonance that have a strong dependence on the magnetic field strength . as we previously discussed in gver et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , these features allow for a precise determination of the magnetic field strength from continuum spectra . to demonstrate this effect , we plot in figure  3 the deviation of the model from the data obtained on march 18 , 2005 ( i.e. , the longest observation ) when",
    "the magnetic field strength is artificially set to 8-sigma higher than the best - fit value , while all the other parameters remain at their best - fit values ( obtained before modifying the field strength ) .",
    "the deviations are due to the broad features that can be seen easily in the residuals .",
    "it is the detection of these unique modifications in the spectra of xte j1810@xmath0197 that allows for the measurement of its surface magnetic field strength .",
    "the contours shown in figure 2 indicate that the surface magnetic field strength and the surface temperature are not correlated .",
    "we find that this is also true for all the other model parameters . as an example ,",
    "when we perform the above experiment where we set the magnetic field strength to an articially higher value but , instead , allow the other model parameters to change in the fit , we find a local minimum with statistic value 805/653 , which is higher than the global minimum .",
    "the measured magnetic field strength remains nearly constant during the decline of the outburst .",
    "the slight evolution of the field strength seen in figure  2 likely arises from using phase - averaged spectra in conjunction with the geometric simplicity of our physical model that does not take into account variations of the field strength on the neutron star surface .",
    "it may also be partially affected by the spatial evolution of the hotspot that gave rise to the outburst on the neutron star surface .",
    "therefore , confirming or rejecting this trend requires modeling that includes more details about the magnetic field topology .",
    "the analysis of the pulse - phase resolved spectra ( or equivalently , the energy - dependent pulse profiles ) of this source will be reported elsewhere .",
    "our measurement is also in good agreement with the value of the magnetic field inferred from the average spindown rate of the pulsar using xmm - newton and rxte observations of the pulsar ( gotthelf & halpern , 2006 , ibrahim et al .",
    "2004 ) , as well as from the short - timescale measurements of the period derivative from radio observations ( camilo et al .",
    "such an accord is unanticipated given the numerous assumptions involved in inferring the magnetic field strength with a vacuum dipole spindown formula ( spitkovsky 2006 ) .",
    "thus , our independent , spectroscopic measurement of the magnetic field strength is a validation of the use of the dipole spindown formula .",
    "the surface temperature is also well constrained , as can be seen in the tight confidence limits in figure  2 .",
    "the time arrow shows the monotonic decline of the temperature during the sequence of the seven xmm-_newton _ observations .",
    "the decay of the source flux during the same time interval can be explained entirely by the cooling of the neutron star crust , as described by the single temperature parameter , without significant changes to the emitting area on the neutron star surface . assuming a distance of 3.3 kpc ( camilo et al .",
    "2006 ) , the radius of this hot region remains approximately @xmath27  km , likely corresponding to the area that is heated during the outburst . as discussed earlier ,",
    "the scattering optical depth @xmath18 and the velocity distribution @xmath19 of electrons in the magnetosphere also remain fairly constant , despite the changes in the hardness of the spectra as the source cools .",
    "indeed , the spectral changes are best described by a change in the temperature alone , without accompanying changes to any other parameter describing the neutron star surface or its magnetosphere .",
    "this physical model allows us to track the changes in the axp during its decline from its outburst and probe the mechanism that produces the transient behavior .",
    "suggested ideas for the observed flares and outbursts for the axps and sgrs rely either on the injection of heat deep in the crust or a sudden change in the topology of the field lines in the magnetosphere .",
    "our analysis , which disentangles the contributions of the processes in the magnetosphere from those on the stellar surface , shows that it is the release of heat in the crust , and not changes in the magnetosphere , that is responsible for this long timescale axp outburst .",
    "we can identify the depth in the crust where the heat is released to produce the outburst of xte j1810@xmath0197 by considering the energetics of the outburst and the measured evolution of the temperature . assuming that the heat is deposited over a surface area @xmath28 at a depth @xmath29 , where the particle density and temperature are given by @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively",
    ", we can calculate the total energy of the outburst @xmath32 as @xmath33 . here",
    ", @xmath34 is the resulting increase in the temperature in the deep layer , which is related to the change in the effective temperature by @xmath35 by the eddington - barbier relation . assuming a distance of 3.3 kpc ( camilo et al .",
    "2006 ) and a timescale of @xmath36  yr , we estimate a total energy of @xmath37  erg for the outburst using the typical luminosity @xmath38 .",
    "finally , we calculate the particle density at a given depth using the detailed surface model of the neutron star used in fitting the spectral data . requiring that , during the outburst , @xmath39 is larger than @xmath40  kev@xmath41  kev , as inferred from the temperature evolution , we find that the energy release occurred at a depth of @xmath42  m , which corresponds to a column depth of @xmath43 g  @xmath14 .",
    "this shows that the currents carrying the magnetic field must be decaying in the upper crust . for the transient axp",
    ", the lack of subsequent energy release at such depths allows the crust to cool completely , and fade back to the very low quiescent flux level .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank jules halpern for suggesting xte j1810 - 197 as an ideal candidate for spectral studies .",
    "we also thank pat slane , harvey tannanbaum , jeff mcclintock , and anatoly spitkovsky for useful discussions , and dimitrios psaltis , ali alpar and fernando camilo for detailed comments on the manuscript .",

    "the contours show the one- and two - sigma confidence limits on the parameters obtained from the individual observations .",
