    "coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) are spectacular large - scale disturbed structures involving great explosion of solar material into heliosphere .",
    "solar wind structures or interplanetary manifestations of cmes are now generally referred to as interplanetary coronal mass ejections ( icmes ) , which are the heliospheric counterparts of cmes at the sun ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "icmes often expand in size with radial distance in the inner heliosphere since their internal pressures are generally higher than the ambient solar wind , and their leading edges usually move faster than the trailing edges ( see * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the radial width increases with distance out to @xmath0 15 au ( astronomical unit ) @xcite ; beyond this distance the widths are relatively constant because icmes reach equilibrium with the background solar wind @xcite .    for an expanding icme",
    ", the proton temperature would be expected to decrease more quickly within the icme than in the ambient solar wind due to adiabatic cooling .",
    "however , the proton temperature inside icmes does not behave even qualitatively as expected . @xcite and @xcite found that the proton temperature inside the icmes from 0.3 to 5.4 au decreases slower than in the background solar wind .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite combined voyager 1 and voyager 2 data and extended such findings out to 30 au .",
    "the polytropic index @xmath1 was determined empirically to be 1.15 @xmath0 1.33 , implying considerable local plasma heating within icmes .",
    "the most probable energy source of plasma heating within icmes is believed to come from the magnetic field . however , the mechanism which dissipates magnetic energy into thermal energy is still an open question . in the literature ,",
    "several candidate mechanisms were proposed to heat the cme plasma , which are listed as follows : ( 1 ) outflows from the cme current sheets have the potential to heat cmes far from the flare sites @xcite ; ( 2 ) kinking is frequently observed in prominences and during solar eruptions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the kink instability could heat cme plasma by injecting energy at outer scale for turbulence development through large - scale motions ; ( 3 ) heating by small - scale magnetic reconnection is another candidate mechanism and is similar to the nanoflare model of coronal heating .",
    "the frequently occurred tearing mode is one possible manifestation of this mechanism @xcite ; ( 4 ) the damping of mhd waves driven by photospheric motions is also one of the mechanisms of heating icmes ; ( 5 ) thermal conduction along magnetic field is quick and therefore regarded as a potential contributor to the heating of icme plasma @xcite ; ( 6 ) energetic particles accelerated during the impulsive phase of solar flares could contribute to cme heating ; ( 7 ) counteracting flows , such as upward concave flux rope segments yield shocks from colliding flows accelerated by gravity , may heat cme plasma @xcite ; and ( 8) ohmic heating from net current in the flux rope ( see @xcite and the references therein for more details ) .",
    "nonlinear cascade of low - frequency alfvnic fluctuations ( afs ) , which transfers energy from large scales down to small kinetic scales for further dissipation , is generally regarded as one candidate energy source for the heating of icme plasma .",
    "it can preferentially heat heavy ions within icmes as observed @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that heavy ions could be heated due to interactions between anti - sunward and sunward afs . @xcite",
    "found turbulence inside an icme at 3.25 au and suggested that magnetic turbulence dissipation seems sufficient to explain the icme heating ; they assumed that the turbulence was driven by afs , though afs were seldom reported inside 280 icmes from 0.3 to 20 au . to our knowledge , quite limit numbers of af events haven been published in the literature .",
    "@xcite found possible afs lasting for almost one hour in an icme detected at 0.7 au .",
    "@xcite later presented clear afs with 2-hr duration inside an icme observed at 0.3 au .",
    "traditional diagnosis of afs may underestimate the degree of alfvnicity , and thus possibly miss some afs .",
    "@xcite proposed a new approach to search for afs , which could reduce the uncertainties in identifying afs . in this study , we apply this af diagnosis approach to identify afs inside icmes from 1 to 6 au based on _ voyager 2 _ data .",
    "abundant afs are found within icmes .",
    "clear indirect evidence of the contributions of afs on icme plasma heating is provided .",
    "the differences of icmes lie in the different signatures of magnetic field , plasma , composition and energetic particle .",
    "however , the identification of icmes still remains subjective undertaking .",
    "no single characteristic has proved both necessary and sufficient to define the presence of icmes .",
    "the currently used signatures for the in situ identification of icmes at 1 au have been well summarized ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , such as smooth magnetic field rotation and enhancement , low proton temperature , extreme density decrease , enhanced alpha / proton ratio , abundance and charge state anomalies of heavy ion species , bidirectional electron beams and cosmic rays , and so on . in the outer heliosphere ,",
    "icme identification becomes even more difficult .",
    "on one hand , some signatures of icmes are blurred through interaction with the ambient solar wind . on the other hand ,",
    "current available measurements from the limited instruments can not supply the complete set of variables required for comprehensive identification .",
    "@xcite identified 147 probable icmes from hourly averaged solar wind plasma and magnetic field data by _ voyager 2 _ between 1 and 30 au .",
    "the primary criterion they used is abnormally low solar wind proton temperature proposed by @xcite .",
    "this criterion compares the observed proton temperature @xmath2 with the  expected \" temperature @xmath3 appropriate for  normally expanding \" with the observed solar wind speed @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath3 ( in unit of @xmath5 k ) is calculated from the relationship derived by @xcite :    @xmath6    they also examined the magnetic field and plasma parameters to exclude regions which may not be icmes , such as regions associated with heliospheric current sheet crossings .",
    "the determination of icme boundaries is uncertain since different signatures usually have different boundaries .",
    "the boundaries chose by them were generally coincident with the regions where @xmath7 with some adjustments based on reduced magnetic field fluctuations .    in this work ,",
    "we identify icmes mainly based on the probable icme list of _ voyager _ 2 given by @xcite . in order to insure the availability of combined magnetic field and plasma data with temporal resolution of 48 s or 96 seconds ( which is adequate for analyzing afs suggested by @xcite ) and to avoid the complications caused by the heating of interstellar pickup ions @xcite , we only use _ voyager 2 _ data from 1977 december 1 to the end of 1979 . during this time period",
    ", a total of 33 probable icmes are identified .",
    "note that , some minor adjustments of icme boundaries have been done based on the data sets with a higher time resolution compared to hourly data sets used by @xcite .    to reduce the uncertainties of afs diagnosis introduced in the determinations of the background magnetic field and the dehoffmann - teller ( ht ) frame , we apply the approach proposed by @xcite to identify afs within icmes . instead of the original data sets ,",
    "the bandpass filtered signals of the plasma velocity and magnetic field observations are used to check the waln relation as follows :    @xmath8    here , @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent the bandpassed @xmath11 ( solar wind velocity ) and @xmath12 ( local alfvn velocity ) with the @xmath13-@xmath14 filter , respectively .",

    "the speed of the leading edge is 450 km / s , which is faster than that of the trailing edge of 390 km / s .",
