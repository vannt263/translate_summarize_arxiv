    "in the early 1980s single - mode silica optical fibers were recognized as a privileged medium for experiments in quantum optics because they exhibit a well defined transverse mode and very low losses .",
    "the kerr nonlinearity of silica has been used to produce non classical states of light .",
    "squeezed state production in fibers was pioneered by levenson _",
    "@xcite in 1985 .",
    "since then a large number of squeezing experiments have been performed with cw - light or short optical pulses ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , fiorentino _ et al . _ demonstrated that optical fibers may also be used to produce _ twin - photons _",
    "pairs @xcite .",
    "this new kind of twin - photon source is well suited for fiber - optic quantum communication and quantum cryptography networks .",
    "in contrast with the traditional twin - photon sources , based on the @xmath0 down - conversion process , it avoids large coupling losses occurring when the pairs are launched into long distance communication fibers .",
    "the physical process used in @xcite to generate twin - photon pairs is a four - wave mixing ( fwm ) phase - matched by the interplay of the optical kerr effect and the chromatic dispersion , called ( scalar ) modulation instability ( mi ) .",
    "this process can be basically understood as the destruction of two pump photons at frequency @xmath1 and the creation of stokes ( red - shifted ) and anti - stokes ( blue - shifted ) photons at frequencies @xmath2 and @xmath3 satisfying the energy conservation relation @xmath4 . in the time domain , the beating of the pump , signal and idler waves produces a fast modulation of the pump envelope .",
    "mi is a spontaneous phenomena which can be described in the framework of classical nonlinear optics @xcite . in this classical framework",
    ", one usually considers that mi is induced by some incoherent noise initially present on the pump wave .",
    "twin - photon pair production requires however a very low input noise power to be efficient ( otherwise the twin - photons are buried in the background photon noise ) .",
    "such a regime is dominated by vacuum fluctuations and requires a quantized field theory to be described properly .",
    "a small - perturbation approach of this problem @xcite ( non depleted pump approximation ) shows that vacuum fluctuations can induce the mi even in the absence of any classical input noise .",
    "this is an ideal situation for twin - photon pairs production , but it never occurs in a real life experiment . in practice , classical input noise and vacuum fluctuations compete for inducing mi .    understanding the dynamical development of mi from a quantum point of view is an important issue for the design of fiber - optics twin - photon pairs sources .",
    "we present an unified approach to this problem based on the _ stochastic nonlinear schrdinger equations _",
    "( snlse ) @xcite .",
    "this formalism is equivalent to quantum - field heisenberg equations but has two main advantages .",
    "first , it is very suitable for numerical simulations of complex situations where classical noise and vacuum fluctuations act together .",
    "second the _ correspondence principle _ of quantum physics , i.e. the transition from quantum to classical world , looks very natural in the snlse formalism .",
    "the mi observed in standard non - birefringent single - mode silica fibers is often referred to as _",
    "scalar _ modulation instability ( s - mi ) because polarization of light plays no role in this process . in birefringent fibers",
    "different kinds of mi may appear because of the interplay of nonlinearity , chromatic dispersion and birefringence .",
    "this case will be referred as _ vector _",
    "modulation instability ( v - mi ) .",
    "twin - photon pairs sources based on v - mi have not been demonstrated yet , in contrast with s - mi based sources @xcite . in this article",
    ", we will however address both issues because we recognize that v - mi twin - photon pairs sources could be more practicable than s - mi based ones . the theoretical and computational tools that we developed apply to all kind of mi , including the low - birefringence , high - birefringence and scalar limits .",
    "this article is divided into four sections , beginning with the present introduction .",
    "the second section consists of a review of the approach based on a perturbation analysis around the steady state solution .",
    "this is the simplest method of approaching the problem of mi .",
    "it allows us to set the stage for the more sophisticated approach we then develop and to make contact with earlier work in the field . then in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we exhibit the snlse for scalar and vector mi .",
    "contrary to the approach of sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] these equations are not based on a perturbation analysis and are valid in the strongly non linear regime .",
    "they describe both mi originating from classical noise and from vacuum fluctuations ( quantum noise ) .",
    "the snlse we obtain generalize the earlier results of @xcite .",
    "in particular the snlse we obtain does not require the birefringence to be either small or large as in earlier work @xcite , but are valid for all values of the birefringence .",
    "for the interested reader we present a self contained derivation of these equations in the appendix . in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] we use the _ split - step fourier _ method to integrate the snlse derived in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , and illustrate our algorithm on the cases of scalar mi and of vector mi both for weak , intermediate , and strong birefringence .",
    "in order to interpret the results of the numerical integration it is essential to introduce the notion of _ mode_. this allows us to compare the numerical results and the analytical solutions derived from perturbation theory .",
    "we also compare in detail the characteristics of mi induced by classical noise and by quantum noise . in a companion article @xcite we shall show that our numerical results are in very good quantitative agreement with experimental results .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction several kind of mi can occur in optical fibers . from a general point of view , mi occurs when the continuous wave ( steady - state ) propagation is unstable . the most straightforward way to get some insight on how the mi develops is to perform a small - perturbation analysis of the steady - state .",
    "however this method has limitations : it can not address the strongly non linear regime and simple analytical formulas can not be always obtained by this method .    in this section",
    "we illustrate the perturbation method in the case of s - mi , which is the simplest .",
    "s - mi occurs in isotropic fibers in the anomalous dispersion regime . in",
    "what follows we will review the most important aspects of this approach , focussing on the comparison between the classical and quantum descriptions , and on the limitations of this approach . in sec .",
