    "the appearance of coherence in a system , which is central to our understanding of laser and matter wave physics , depends on the interplay between various parameters , such as temperature , interaction strength , confinement , and dimensionality .",
    "in particular , in the recently achieved confined weakly - interacting quasi - one - dimensional bose gases in harmonic traps @xcite , dipole traps @xcite and atom chips @xcite coherence can only be maintained across the entire spatial extent of the system at a sufficiently low temperature , which is however much lower than the ` critical temperature ' for the onset of quantum degeneracy . at intermediate temperatures , long wavelength fluctuations in the phase ,",
    "restrict the coherence to smaller regions @xcite .",
    "this effect has already been observed experimentally in very elongated three - dimensional bose - einstein condensates @xcite .    in his seminal work @xcite ,",
    "glauber characterised the coherence of a system by means of a set of normalised correlation functions .",
    "typically , the few ` lowest order ' correlation functions are enough to characterise the coherence of a system @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most important correlation function is the first order correlation function , referred to in condensed matter literature as the off - diagonal one - body density matrix . in an atomic gas above the degeneracy temperature",
    ", this quantity decays rapidly to zero , on a scale comparable to the atomic de broglie wavelength ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the opposite extreme ,",
    "when this quantity tends to a nonzero plateau , the system becomes coherent and is said to contain a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) . in degenerate one - dimensional ( 1d ) gases , however , an intermediate state exists , in which the off - diagonal one - body density matrix does decay to zero within the system size , but at a much slower rate . in this regime ,",
    "the system is said to contain a quasi - condensate @xcite .",
    "the phase coherence properties of such trapped quasi - condensates were first investigated by petrov et al .",
    "@xcite in the low temperature limit , where quasi - condensate depletion can be treated as negligible .",
    "a number of alternative mean field approaches have appeared in the literature since @xcite . in particular , the theory of andersen et al .",
    "@xcite treats both phase and density fluctuations in a self - consistent manner , thus providing the natural extension of the theory of petrov et al .",
    "@xcite to finite temperatures . using this theory",
    ", we constructed the universal one - dimensional ( 1d ) phase diagram in the weakly - interacting regime @xcite .",
    "we also showed that inclusion of density fluctuations can potentially lead to a significant decrease in the equilibrium coherence length of a trapped quasi - condensate @xcite .",
    "although initial experiments performed to address this question found no such effect within their experimental resolution @xcite , we argued that the apparent insensitivity of the ( suitably scaled ) coherence length on density fluctuations only arises in the regime @xmath0 , in which all experiments to date have been performed , where @xmath1 is the characteristic temperature for phase fluctuations , and @xmath2 is the ` critical temperature ' for the onset of ( quasi)condensation . in fact , despite a relatively weak coupling between density and phase fluctuations in most experiments , the first evidence of such coupling may have actually been recently observed @xcite .",
    "the optimum conditions for the unequivocal experimental demonstration of such coupling between density and phase fluctuations was laid out in @xcite .    in this paper , we present results for the three lowest order spatial correlation functions at equilibrium , based on the stochastic langevin treatment of stoof @xcite .",
    "where appropriate , these results are compared and contrasted to predictions of various mean field theories @xcite .",
    "firstly , we discuss the dependence of a suitably - defined equilibrium coherence length on temperature .",
    "predictions of the present treatment are shown to be in full agreement with the mean field theory of andersen et al .",
    "@xcite , which includes density fluctuations in an ab initio manner , thus complementing and extending earlier related work @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the present work provides additional evidence to support our earlier claim @xcite ( based on mean field theory ) that the coherence length is indeed sensitive to density fluctuations and quasi - condensate depletion in realistic parameter regimes .",
    "the spatial variation of the off - diagonal first order correlation function with distance @xmath3 from the trap centre ( @xmath4 ) is evaluated in two different ways , corresponding experimentally to the particular atomic interference experiment that could be performed : in the first approach , atoms at the centre are numerically ` interfered ' with atoms at a distance @xmath3 from the trap centre , whereas the other approach ` interferes ' atoms located symmetrically about the trap centre , i.e. , at points @xmath5 .",
    "good agreement is found between these two approaches within the quasi - condensate region .",
    "the interplay between quasi - condensation and ` true ' condensation is known to be manifested , not only in the change of the scaled coherence length , but also in the shape of the first order correlation function , which changes smoothly from exponential to gaussian @xcite . analysing the correlation functions obtained by the stochastic approach at different temperatures , we model the interplay between such behaviour by two parameters , the first one controlling the shape of the function , and the second representing an appropriately - defined coherence length , which decreases uniformly with increasing temperature .",
    "higher order density - density correlation functions contain crucial information regarding the system s coherence , and determination of such correlations ( indirectly via measurement of the collisional interaction energy @xcite , or the three - body inelastic loss rate @xcite ) has played a key role in unequivocally demonstrating the experimental observation of bec in ultracold 3d bosonic atomic gases . moreover , second order correlation functions have been well - studied in the context of photon statistics in the hanbury - brown - twiss experiment @xcite , to discriminate between thermal and coherent light fields @xcite , and a similar technique was recently used to experimentally determine the phase coherence length of a trapped elongated quasi - condensate @xcite .",
    "furthermore , spatial two - body correlations have been observed in expanding atom clouds @xcite and atoms produced from molecular breakup @xcite , whereas temporal correlations were measured in continuously outcoupled atom lasers @xcite .",
    "this paper additionally investigates in detail the dependence of the second and third order spatial correlation functions in confined weakly - interacting 1d bose gases on temperature and interaction strength .",
    "the second order correlation function has already been discussed in the weakly - interacting regime in @xcite , with the crossover to the strongly - interacting regime presented in @xcite , and our results reveal good agreement with such treatments in the appropriate regimes .",
    "density - density correlations are also used to directly determine the amount of quasi - condensation present in a system at any given instant .",
    "although already applied to study quasi - condensate growth on an atom chip @xcite , the details of this technique were not explicitly presented in our earlier work . in our opinion",
    ", this approach provides the most direct method that can be experimentally applied to obtain an unequivocal determination of quasi - condensate density profiles .",
    "in addition to providing an alternative to the conventional bimodal density fits , the advantage of experimentally obtaining the quasi - condensate density by the proposed method is that it is not subject to any potential limitations of the particular theory used to analyze the experimental data .",
    "this technique can be readily applied to existing experiments which performed in situ measurements of density fluctuations of quasi-1d bose gases at equilibrium @xcite .",

    "we start by reviewing the stochastic approach which will be used to evaluate all correlation functions presented in this work , and also briefly outlining the particular mean field theories against which our results will be tested .",
    "the stochastic langevin theory of stoof @xcite is a non - equilibrium approach , in which the system dynamics is obtained via a langevin equation governing the evolution of the quasi - condensate order parameter @xmath6 , given by @xcite @xmath7 \\phi(z , t ) + \\eta(z , t)\\;. \\label{lang}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the present work , this equation is applied to study the growth of a 1d degenerate atomic gas in contact with a thermal cloud which acts as its heat bath .",
    "the numerical implementation of this scheme , along with further details , are discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , while alternative but related approaches can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in addition to the usual kinetic , potential and interaction terms appearing within the square brackets of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , stoof s langevin equation contains the contribution @xmath8 , which describes pumping of the one - dimensional gas from the surrounding thermal reservoir . in the classical approximation imposed here for numerical simplicity ,",
    "whereby the non - condensed 1d atomic cloud relaxes to the ` classical ' value @xmath9^{-1}$ ] , the above pumping term obeys @xmath10 the term @xmath11 corresponds to associated noise arising from the random nature of collisions occuring in the system .",
    "this noise term has gaussian correlations of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes averaging over the realizations of the noise .",
    "the quantities of eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) depend on the one - dimensional keldysh self - energy , @xmath14 , which accounts both for collisions that send a thermal atom into the quasi - condensate , and those which promote a quasi - condensate atom into the thermal cloud .",
    "the formulation of this theory ensures that the trapped gas relaxes to the correct equilibrium , in accordance with the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "the quantity @xmath15 appearing in eqs .",
    "( 1)-(2 ) describes the chemical potential of the system , whereas the external potential @xmath16 is treated as harmonic throughout this work , i.e. @xmath17 , where @xmath18 the corresponding confining frequency .    the quantity @xmath6 contains information about both mean field and fluctuations around it .",
    "it therefore implicitly includes both density and phase fluctuations , and acts as an approximation to the bose field operator @xmath19 .",
    "predictions of this theory are based upon averaging the langevin field @xmath6 over different noise realizations .",
    "in particular , this theory enables an accurate determination of both diagonal and off - diagonal , spatial and temporal correlation functions of any order at any spatial and temporal coordinate .",
    "this is achieved by suitable numerical autocorrelation measurements of the ` order parameter ' @xmath6 , upon making the following identification @xmath20    in this paper we restrict our analysis to spatial correlations at equilibrium . to study these",
    ", we first evolve the system for a sufficiently long time , @xmath21 , such that it relaxes to the correct equilibrium , before performing the desired same - time autocorrelation measurements .",
    "the first order normalised off - diagonal correlation function @xmath22 associated with fluctuations in the quasi - condensate phase is thus calculated with respect to the centre of the trap via @xmath23 higher order correlation functions are also routinely obtained by a simple generalisation of the above formula . in particular , the second and third order correlation functions evaluated at the same spatial coordinate at equilibrium are numerically obtained via @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "the above technique is very powerful , as it additionally enables a full non - equilibrium determination of coherence properties of the system , as demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "this is of direct relevance to recent growth experiments @xcite which will be investigated in future work .      in our initial analysis , results of the first order correlation function , evaluated from eq .",
    "( 5 ) , will be compared against correponding results of a modified finite temperature mean field theory valid in low dimensions @xcite .",

    "predictions of the stochastic approach are found to be in full agreement with the mean field theory which includes density fluctuations @xcite .",

    "importantly , these latter two theories show consistent behaviour over the entire temperature range , with only slight differences in the shapes of their predicted correlation functions at intermediate temperatures , presumably arising because the stochastic treatment does not predict gaussian behaviour close to the origin .",

    "( 11 ) is thus plotted by the brown ( grey ) triangles in fig .",
    "thus there is good agreement between the stochastic and analytical theories in the temperature range considered here .",
    "however , the stochastic theory predicts an additional slight _ reduction _ in coherence , as manifested by the _",
    "higher _ value of @xmath97 , with the extent of this reduction increasing with increasing temperature .",
    "next , we investigate the dependence of the three - lowest order correlation functions on the effective 1d interaction strength at fixed temperature , with our analysis again restricted to the weakly - interacting regime @xmath112 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the 1d interaction strength can be parametrised in terms of the 1d coupling constant @xmath117 .",
    "this parameter can be changed either by tuning the 3d scattering length via feshbach resonances @xcite , or by modifying the transverse confinement , while keeping all other parameters fixed .",
    "since an increase in the interaction strength causes a reduction of coherence , as demonstrated explicitly below , we have chosen to discuss here a rather low temperature example , with @xmath118 , for which there is appreciable coherence in the system .",

    "in conclusion , we carried out a systematic analysis of the dependence of the three lowest order correlation functions of a one - dimensional ultracold atomic gas on temperature and effective interaction strength , by means of a stochastic langevin approach in the ` classical ' approximation .",

    "results for the off - diagonal normalized first order correlation function were shown to be practically indistinguishable from those of a mean field theory which is valid in low dimensions and explicitly includes density fluctuations . this should be contrasted to theories which a priori ignore density fluctuations , with such theories shown to predict a larger amount of coherence than is physically present .",
    "two different approximations for the evaluation of this correlation function were used , corresponding to different interference experiments that could be performed , and their profiles were shown to be very similar within the appropriate spatial range .",
    "we further investigated the temperature crossover in the shape of the correlation function , which evolves from gaussian to exponential with increasing temperature , and used this to obtain a monotonically varying coherence length .",
    "moreover , second and third order correlation functions at the same point were investigated as a function of temperature and interaction strength . the observed decrease in coherence when",
    "either of these parameters is increased was shown to be consistent with other results in the literature .",
    "importantly , consideration of density - density correlations was shown to lead to an accurate determination of the quasi - condensate and thermal density profiles .",
    "this approach could be used in experiments , to provide a more accurate determination of quasi - condensate profiles and fractions , offering an alternative to the bimodal fitting schemes currently used .",
    "in addition to providing valuable information for equilibrium profiles , to which the present analysis was restricted , the stochastic approach is well - suited for discussing growth of coherence in quasi - one - dimensional bose gases , an issue that will be addressed in subsequent work .",
    "it is a pleasure to acknowledge numerous discussions with henk stoof which have significantly contributed to the present work .",

    "this theory is valid both for homogeneous and trapped systems in _ all _ dimensions , and has been shown to be consistent with well - known results in the appropriate limits @xcite .",
    "furthermore , such an approach enables a direct determination of quasi - condensate density profiles .    in the harmonic trap",
    ", one obtains an appropriate finite temperature nonlinear schrdinger equation for the quasi - condensate , coupled to the bogoliubov - de - gennes equations for the excitations . solving these self - consistently within the thomas - fermi approximation yields a mean field approximation for the quasi - condensate spatial extent .",
