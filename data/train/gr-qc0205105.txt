    "\\(i ) our first motivation was to extend the _ lorentz - poincar ether theory _ so that gravitation be included .",
    "the lorentz - poincar ether theory may be described as the theory according to which a ) the ether is an inertial frame e such that maxwell s equations are valid in e , and b ) any material object that moves with respect to e undergoes a lorentz contraction . as shown , in particular , by prokhovnik,@xcite this theory is physically equivalent to standard _ special _ relativity ( sr ) .",
    "this makes its ether undetectable , hence ",
    "superfluous \" ( einstein 1905 ) .",
    "but since sr does not involve gravitation , we may ask whether a preferred frame could exist but remain hidden in the absence of gravitation , and become detectable in its presence .",
    "+ ( ii ) an  ether \" could help to make quantum theory and gravitation theory compatible . quantum theory was originally built in a flat space - time , moreover it uses a preferred time . in flat space - time , this is the inertial time , which depends on the inertial frame in a way that remains compatible with lorentz invariance . yet in the curved space - time of gravitation , there seems to be no way to prefer some time coordinate , except if we _ a priori _ admit a  preferred space - time foliation \" , i.e. an ether .",
    "this may be illustrated already for the case of the klein - gordon equation , for which many possible extensions to curved space - time _ a priori _ exist , but one is preferred if we have an ether.@xcite further , quantum theory shows that  vacuum \" has physical effects , e.g. the casimir effect , now experimentally confirmed .",
    "+ ( iii ) investigating a strongly alternative theory also opens a new way to solve some problems common to general relativity ( gr ) and to most extensions of it : a ) singularities : the investigated ",
    "scalar ether - theory \" does avoid singularities , in gravitational collapse@xcite and in cosmology as well.@xcite b ) gauge condition : the solutions to the underdeterminacy of the einstein equations as a system of partial differential equations are either to say that the lorentz manifold is determined modulo diffeomorphisms , or to add a gauge condition in a fixed space - time manifold ( the latter way is used in applications ) .",
    "what is the precise link between these two solutions ? in the scalar ether - theory , there is no need for any gauge , yet space - time is fixed .",
    "c ) galactical dark matter : identified candidates seem poorly found . in the present ether - theory ,",
    "the preferred - frame effects are probably more important at the galactical scale and beyond , due to the large time scales involved .",
    "n.b . : most equations are preferred - frame ones with space covariance only .",
    "+ ( i ) gravitation is seen as archimedes thrust in an imagined perfect fluid (  ether \" ) with pressure @xmath0 and density @xmath1 .",
    "this leads to define the _ gravity acceleration vector _ as follows:@xcite @xmath2 note that , due to eq .",
    "( [ gvector ] ) , @xmath0 and @xmath3 decrease towards the attraction , thus @xmath4 in a gravitational field , where m is the  space \" manifold , i.e. the set of the positions @xmath5 in the preferred frame e. + ( ii ) _ assumed metric effects of a gravitational field._@xcite we assume that the space - time @xmath6 is equipped with a flat metric @xmath7 for which the preferred frame e is an inertial ( galilean ) frame .",
    "the inertial time @xmath8 in e is called the  absolute time \" , and the euclidean space metric associated with @xmath7 in the frame e is denoted by @xmath9 . yet we also assume that , in a gravitational field , i.e. @xmath10 , there are metric effects , similar to those due to uniform motion ( see ref .",
    "1 ) : the meters are contracted and the clocks are slowed down , in the ratio @xmath11 and ( for the meters ) in the direction @xmath12 only .",
    "this means a dilation ( contraction ) of the length ( time ) intervals , when they are indeed measured with physical instruments , as compared with those that would be evaluated in terms of the flat space metric @xmath9 and the absolute time @xmath8 .",
    "hence , the  physical \" space metric @xmath13 in the frame e is a riemannian one , and the measured time is a  local \" one , denoted by @xmath14 ( at point @xmath15 ) .",
    "thus , the  physical \" space - time metric @xmath16 is a curved lorentzian metric .",
    "moreover , sr leads to assuming the relation @xmath17 .",
    "+ ( iii ) _ gravitational field equation . _",
    "the following equation is stated for the scalar gravitational field @xmath0 : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the @xmath20 component of the energy - momentum tensor of matter and nongravitational fields * t * , when the time coordinate is @xmath21 with @xmath8 the absolute time , and in any spatial coordinates that are adapted to the preferred reference frame e.@xcite the derivative with respect to the local time is defined by @xmath22 in eq .",

    "+ ( iv ) _ dynamics is governed by newton s second law : _ force = time - derivative of momentum.@xcite the force over the test particle is the gravitational force @xmath24 , plus the nongravitational ( e.g. electromagnetic ) force , where @xmath25 is the relativistic inertial mass , involving the lorentz factor .",
    "the momentum is @xmath26 ; @xmath27 and @xmath28 are evaluated with the physical metric .",
    "the time - derivative of momentum is uniquely defined from compelling requirements ( including leibniz rule for a scalar product).@xcite in the _ static _",

    "+ ( ii ) for definiteness , each body is assumed to be made of a barotropic perfect fluid ( one fluid per body ) . other constitutive laws may also be considered , of course .",
    "+ ( iii ) a family ( @xmath30 ) of gravitating systems is deduced from the given system s. to do this , we use the fact that an exact similarity transformation exists in newtonian gravity.@xcite this transformation is applied to the initial data for s. for this , @xmath31 is substituted for the newtonian potential , where @xmath32 ( @xmath33 for a weak field ) .",
    "the initial data for s ( the system of interest , e.g. the solar system ) is general,@xcite in contrast with ref",

    "therefore , the derivation of asymptotic expansions is straightforward.@xcite ( in the standard pn scheme , @xmath38 is _ formally _ considered as a small parameter . ) that @xmath38 , not @xmath41 , turns out to be the effective small parameter , is due to the fact that it is only @xmath38 that enters in the equations .",
    "the theory admits consistent expansions in powers of @xmath37 ( or @xmath38 ) .",
    "the first ( zero - order ) term is newtonian gravity , hence the theory admits a correct newtonian limit .",
    "the first - order approximation in @xmath37 or @xmath38 is the first pn approximation . using these expansions",
    "is justified insofar as the system of interest corresponds to a small value @xmath42 of @xmath37 , which is the case , e.g. , for the solar system .",
    "the mass centers ( mc ) are defined@xcite as local barycenters of the rest - mass density @xmath43 ( instead of , e.g. , the active energy density @xmath19 , eq .",
    "( [ field ] ) ) , because ( i ) @xmath44 outside the bodies ( which is wrong if one takes instead a density that involves gravitational energy , since the latter is distributed in the whole space ) and ( ii ) @xmath43 , or rather its pn approximation , obeys the usual continuity equation , i.e. without adding gravitational energy and its flux . to get the mc s equation of motion ,",
    "one just integrates the local equations of motion inside the different bodies.@xcite due to the use of the asymptotic method , the local equations of orders 0 and 1 in @xmath37 or @xmath38 are separated .",
    "e.g. :    @xmath45    for the continuity equation , derived from the time component at the first pna .",
    "the equation of order 1 is linear with respect to the fields of order 1 . therefore , separate equations are also obtained for the mc s , and the equation for pn corrections ( order 1 ) is linear with respect to order-1 quantities . to get tractable equations ,",
    "every field is decomposed into a self - field and an external field , and account is taken of the  good separation \" between different bodies , which means that @xmath46 ( @xmath47 is the radius of body ( @xmath48 ) ) . in the solar system , terms up to and including @xmath49 must be retained.@xcite a rigid motion , possibly including self - rotation , is assumed for each body .",
    "finally , the rest - mass density of the order 0 , @xmath50 , is assumed spherical for each body , at the stage of calculating the pn _",
    "one thus gets explicit equations of motion for the mass centers.@xcite they show that the self - rotation of the bodies _ and their internal structure _ influence the motion from the first pna .",
    "_ this follows naturally from using the asymptotic method and should hold true for gr . _",
    "in order to use the equations of motion for the mass centers@xcite so as to check the theory , we have to know the values of the parameters that enter these equations .",
    "these are the 0-order masses @xmath51 of the bodies ( here the major bodies of the solar system ) , the initial conditions of their motion , and the constant velocity @xmath52 of the global zero - order mass center of the solar system , with respect to the preferred frame e ( and also the constant @xmath53).@xcite ( of course there is no parameter like @xmath52 in conventional theories . )",
    "these unknown parameters depend on the theory",
    ". they must be determined by optimizing the agreement between predictions and observations.@xcite our computer code loops on the numerical solution of the translational equations of motion in order to optimize the parameters.@xcite this code has been tested by investigating in which measure one may reproduce ( over one century ) the predictions of the de403 ephemeris,@xcite by using purely newtonian equations of motion.@xcite it has also been applied to adjust over 60 centuries a less simplified model , in which the pn corrections in the schwarzschild field of the sun are also considered.@xcite +        in the version of the code that incorporates the equations of motion@xcite derived from the present theory , a lorentz transform allows to pass from the preferred reference frame to the frame bound with the zero - order global barycenter , and vice - versa .",
    "this transform , as well as the inverse transform , is determined by the adjustable vector @xmath52 .",
    "thus , the adjustment process of the translational equations on observational data provides us eventually with the value of @xmath52 that minimizes the residual with the set of observations .",
    "note that the  observational data `` are currently taken from an _ ephemeris based on gr,_@xcite specifically we take a set of heliocentric positions of the eight major planets , between 1956 and 2000 . with these input data , themselves a fitting of observations by gr equations , the magnitude of the optimal vector @xmath52 is @xmath54 3 km / s , which is significant .",
    "the difference between de403 and our thus - adjusted equations of motion is small ( cf . the residual advance in mercury s longitude of perihelion , with respect to newton s theory : 43 '' ) , but significant ( fig .",
    "the self - rotation of all nine bodies is neglected ) .",
