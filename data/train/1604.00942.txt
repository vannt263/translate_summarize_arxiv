    "in the last decades , air travel has become one of the most frequently used means of transportation .",
    "the international air transport association ( iata ) expects traveler numbers to reach 7.3 billion by 2034 , representing a 4.1% average annual growth in demand for air connectivity . at the same time , an increasing number of airlines is competing for market shares , which raises the need to attract customers while balancing costs and services .",
    "an increasing number of customers ( i.e. , travelers ) share their experiences and viewpoints on airlines and airports in form of online reviews in order to help others to better judge airline and airport quality .",
    "such reviews may consist of free - text reviews combined with ratings ( e.g. , by means of 5-star ratings ) . as a consequence , a vast amount of airline review data is available on the web , which is not only of interest for the airline industry but also for researchers working on analyzing the impact of the factors / features contributing to user satisfaction @xcite .    in this paper , we present work - in - progress on a recently started project that aims at explaining and predicting traveler satisfaction using airline review data .",
    "specifically , it is our goal to identify critical features that contribute to air travel satisfaction based on rating and textual reviews . our idea is to exploit these features in order to predict whether a traveler is satisfied with her airline / airport choice based on the given ratings and/or textual review .",
    "this is summed up in the following two research questions that guide our work :    * which rating and textual features of airline reviews are most indicative for traveler satisfaction ?",
    "* to what extent can we predict traveler satisfaction using the available rating and textual features of airline reviews ?",
    "* explaining traveler satisfaction . * in order to better explain how the features contribute to traveler satisfaction , and thus , to address _ rq1 _ , we exploit real - world airline review data , which was crawled from the skytrax portal .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : skytrax ] , in skytrax users can ( a ) enter review text and ( b ) rate various services . moreover , the user can state her final traveler satisfaction not only using an overall rating between 1 and 10 but also using a checkbox to indicate if she would recommend this airline or airport to other travelers . in terms of rating features ,",
    "we explore features derived from four different review categories , namely airport , lounge , airline and seat reviews . in terms of textual features",
    ", we infer the sentiment of the review text ( see section [ sec : dataset ] ) .    to identify which review features are most indicative for traveler satisfaction , we conduct a feature analysis in which we correlate rating and textual features with the overall rating given by the user .",
    "we find that airport _ queuing _",
    "time , lounge _ comfort _ , airline _ cabin staff _ quality and seat _ legroom _ space are factors that highly impact the overall traveler satisfaction .",
    "we also find that the sentiment of the review content is a good indicator to determine whether a traveler was satisfied with the travel .",
    "additionally , we perform clustering and cluster labelling of the textual content in order to identify topics which are discussed in the reviews . in the long run",
    ", this may help to extend the rating schema .",
    "for example , if many users discuss the topic `` immigration '' in their textual review , the rating portal could introduce a novel rating feature , which enables users to rate the quality of the immigration service .    * predicting traveler satisfaction .",
    "* we utilize the available rating information as well as the sentiment of the textual reviews as features for our prediction study ( _ rq2 _ ) .",
    "we formulate the prediction task as a binary classification problem of the final traveler satisfaction signal indicated by the _ would you recommend this airline / airport ?",
    "_ checkbox ( see figure [ fig : skytrax ] ) .",
    "we find strong performance in predicting the traveler satisfaction using the individual rating features . by using a combination of the best performing rating features ,",
    "we demonstrate that the prediction accuracy can even be increased .",
    "additionally , we show that a classifier , which solely uses the sentiment of the review text , provides a competitive performance in terms of prediction accuracy as well",
    ". this could especially be beneficial in cases where rating features are missing . in terms of metrics",
    ", we report the prediction accuracy by means of the f1-score and auc ( i.e. , area under roc curve ) .",
    "* significance of this work . * with this study , we aim at explaining which rating and textual features of airline reviews have the most impact on predicting traveler satisfaction .",
    "our findings can provide guidance for stakeholders in the airline industry , as well as for researchers , who study online review data to better understand what is important to travellers and what impacts user satisfaction .",
    "since heskett et al . @xcite established a relationship between traveler satisfaction and profitability , research on the airline service quality has become an important issue for the airline industry . as a consequence ,",
    "the authors of @xcite claim that it is crucial to continuously collect and evaluate data about traveler satisfaction and how it relates to the provided service quality in order to be competitive in the airline industry . however , most work that conduct research in airline service quality rely on gathered offline data coming from on - site questionnaires @xcite , airline submissions @xcite or in - depth interviews @xcite .",
    "nowadays , online reviews are getting more popular and as a consequence there is the opportunity to leverage them as a rich and powerful source of information . in fact , there is a lot of valuable hidden information available in online reviews @xcite . as such , web sites like the already mentioned skytrax portal , airlineratings and tripadvisor are important for the airline industry to explain how service quality is perceived by the travelers .",
    "furthermore , this data may be a valuable source for researchers that aim at better understanding the factors that contribute to user satisfaction .",
    "one recent work going into that direction is the one described in @xcite , in which the authors mined review data about airlines in - flight services from the skytrax portal . by grouping travelers via feature - based and clustering - based modelling , the authors showed that inferences can be captured to explain how travelers evaluate in - flight services .",
    "another recent work of yao et al .",
    "@xcite presented a research framework to extract and explore information on a user s opinion about airline service features from a large static corpus of online review texts .    in our work , we perform a comprehensive feature analysis using rating and textual features from airport , lounge , airline and seat reviews in order to explain which features actually contribute to traveler satisfaction .",
    "moreover , we show how the different rating and textual features can be utilized to predict traveler satisfaction .",
    "our methods and results provide practical insights on how to build upon work like @xcite in order to predict traveler satisfaction using online airline reviews .",
    ".statistics of the skytrax dataset showing how many reviews were given by the users in the four categories .",
    "additionally , we report the traveler satisfaction in the categories as the relative number of reviews that were indicated as airlines or airports that would be recommended to other travelers .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     c|c|c|c|c + review type & precision & recall & time ( s ) & roc + seat & 0.811 & 0.813 & 0.01 & 0.849 + lounge & 0.774 & 0.773 & 0.01 & 0.822 + airport & 0.677 & 0.767 & 0.02 & 0.715 + airline & 0.839 & 0.839 & 0.04 & 0.896 +   + review type & precision & recall & time ( s ) & roc + seat & 0.811 & 0.813 & 0.02 & 0.750 + lounge & 0.779 & 0.766 & 0.13 & 0.807 + airport & 0.603 & 0.776 & 0.78 & 0.500 + airline & 0.840 & 0.840 & 2.53 & 0.786 +",
    "in order to find additional potentially influencing factors for the final user satisfaction , we used a simple k - means clustering algorithm to extract topics out of the reviews . as seen in figure [ fig : topics ] , when performing the topic extraction for each review type , we distinguished between the final user satisfaction . with respect to seat reviews , it can be seen that users will mostly write reviews about seat recline when they are not satisfied with their experience .",
    "this is probably also the reason why the seat recline rating was one of the higher correlating features with the overall rating .",
    "moreover , such information suggests that other rating features could be introduced ( e.g. , rating on how easy was it to sleep in the seat ) to improve interpreting the final user satisfaction ."
