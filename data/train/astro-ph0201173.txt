    "halos with the masses of globular clusters , @xmath12 , are predicted to have condensed as early as @xmath131% of the current age of the universe , or redshift @xmath6 .",
    "it is natural to identify these condensations as the sites where the first astrophysical objects , such as stars , or quasars , were born .",
    "current observations directly probe the universe out to redshift @xmath14 , with the record  holder quasar at @xmath15  @xcite , and the history of star  formation and of quasar activity mapped out to @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "however , there is convincing observational evidence that an additional , yet undiscovered population of low  mass galaxies exists at these redshifts and beyond .",

    "an early population of stars or quasars could have photoionized the igm , if they produced at least one ionizing photon per hydrogen atom in the universe .",
    "a naive extrapolation of the luminosity density of bright quasars towards @xmath19 reveals that these sources fall short of this requirement .",
    "extrapolating the known population of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) towards @xmath19 comes closer : assuming that 15@xmath20 of the ionizing radiation from lbgs escapes into the igm ( on average , relative to the escape fraction at 1500 ) , a naive extrapolation shows that lbgs emitted @xmath13 one ionizing photon per hydrogen atom prior to @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "although this would be sufficient to ionize every h atom once , the required photon budget exceeds this value .",
    "the earliest ionizing sources are likely surrounded by numerous `` minihalos '' that had collapsed earlier , but had failed to cool and form any stars or quasars .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : sinks ] .",

    "the mean free path of ionizing photons , before they are absorbed by an evaporating minihalo , is about @xmath23 ( comoving ) mpc . as a result",
    ", the typical fate of an ionizing photon , emitted at @xmath4 , is to be absorbed by a minihalo within a small fraction of the hubble distance  before it could contribute to the reionization of the bulk of the igm .",
    "a simple model of the photoevaporation process  @xcite , summed over the expected population of minihalos , reveals that on average , an h atom in the universe recombines @xmath24 times before redshift @xmath19 .",
    "the implication is that the ionizing emissivity at @xmath25 was @xmath26 times higher than provided by a straightforward extrapolation back in time of known quasar and galaxy populations .",
    "recent detections of civ and siv absorption associated with low column density ly@xmath2 absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars imply that the universe was enriched by metals to a mean level of @xmath27 prior to redshift @xmath28 .",
    "these absorbers , whose hi column densities are as low as @xmath29  @xcite , are identified in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations as regions with typical densities only a few times above that of the mean igm .",
    "this low density rules out `` in  situ '' metal enrichment , and raises the question : where did these metals come from ?",
    "lbgs discovered at redshifts @xmath30 would be natural candidates for producing and dispersing heavy elements in galactic winds  @xcite . in order for a significant fraction of the volume to be enriched within a hubble time ,",
    "the winds need to move heavy elements at mean speeds close to @xmath31 km / s ( the typical separation of lbgs is a few mpc ) .",

    "only systems with masses as low as @xmath38 ( lowest shaded curve ) are sufficiently abundant to widely disperse metals with outflow speeds of a few @xmath34 km / s . however , such low  mass systems have velocity dispersions below @xmath39km / s , and are unlikely to have formed metals in the presence of the post  reionization uv background ( the horizontal solid curve shows the halo mass corresponding to @xmath39km / s ) .",

    " limited growth of these supermassive bhs by gas accretion onto stellar  mass seed holes , with a radiative efficiency of @xmath45 , requires @xmath32 e  foldings on a timescale of @xmath46 years .",
    "while the age of the universe leaves just enough time ( @xmath47 years ) to accomplish this growth by redshift @xmath19 , it does mean that accretion has to start early , and the seeds for the accretion have to be present at ultra ",
    "high redshifts : @xmath48 for an initial seed mass of @xmath49 .",
    "furthermore , the radiative efficiency can not be much higher than @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "since an individual quasar bh could have accreted exceptionally fast ( exceeding the eddington limit ) , it will be important to apply this argument to a larger sample of high  redshift quasars .",
    "nevertheless , we note that a comparison of the light output of quasars at the peak of their activity ( @xmath51 ) and the total masses of their remnant bhs at @xmath52 shows that during the growth of most of the bh mass the radiative efficiency can not be much smaller than @xmath53 , and hence any super - eddington phase must be typically restricted to building only a small fraction of the final bh mass .",

    ", as a function of the external uv radiation field @xmath67 , for halos at z=15 . in halos with @xmath68k ( lower three solid curves ) , only a small fraction of the gas is at sufficiently high density to be unaffected by external radiation fields and cool .",
    "by contrast , in halos with @xmath69k , where atomic cooling operates , the gas contracts to high densities , and virtually all of the disk gas can form @xmath9 and cool to low temperatures ( dotted horizontal line ) .",

    "adopted from  @xcite.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the evolution of halos with @xmath69k differs from their less massive counterparts  @xcite .",
    "efficient atomic line radiation allows rapid cooling to @xmath70 k ; subsequently the gas can contract to high densities nearly isothermally at this temperature . in the absence of @xmath9 molecules",
    ", the gas would likely settle into a locally stable disk and only disks with unusually low spin would be unstable .",
    "however , the initial atomic line cooling leaves a large , out  of  equilibrium residual free electron fraction .",
    "this allows the molecular fraction to build up to a universal value of @xmath71 , almost independently of initial density and temperature ( this is a non  equilibrium freeze  out value that can be understood in terms of timescale arguments  @xcite ) .",
    "unlike in less massive halos , @xmath72 formation and cooling is much less susceptible to feedback from external uv fields .",
    "this is because the high densities @xmath73 that can be reached via atomic cooling .",
    "the @xmath9 abundance that can build up in the presence of a uv radiation field @xmath67 , and hence the temperature to which the gas will cool , is controlled by the ratio @xmath74 .",
    "for example , in order for a parcel of gas to cool down to a temperature of 500k , this ratio has to be less than @xmath75 ( where @xmath67 has units of @xmath76 , and @xmath73 has units of @xmath77 ) . in figure",

    "the figure reveals that flux levels well below that required to fully reionize the universe strongly suppresses the cold gas fraction in @xmath68k halos . by comparison",
    ", the uv flux has nearly negligible impact on @xmath9 formation and cooling in @xmath81k halos , where all of the gas is able to cool to @xmath82k . indeed , under realistic assumptions",
    ", the newly formed molecules in the dense disk can cool the gas to @xmath83 k , and allow the gas to fragment on scales of a few @xmath84  m@xmath85 . various feedback effects , such as @xmath72 photodissociation from internal uv fields , and radiation pressure due to ly@xmath2 photon trapping , are then likely to regulate the eventual efficiency of star formation in these systems .",

    ". a @xmath90 black hole , forming out of @xmath91 of the gas in such a halo , and shining at its eddington limit , would be detectable to a similar redshift .",
