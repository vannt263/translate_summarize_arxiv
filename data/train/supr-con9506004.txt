    "the bean s critical state model@xcite successfully describes the irreversible magnetization in type - ii superconductors by introducing the critical current density @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the temperature and @xmath4 is the magnetic field . in the framework of the bean s model",
    "the value of the slope of the stationary magnetic field profile is less or equal to @xmath5 .",
    "this nonuniform flux distribution does not correspond to an equilibrium state and under certain conditions flux jumps arise in the critical state .",
    "the flux jumping process results in a flux redistribution towards the equilibrium state and is accompanied by a strong heating of the superconductor .",
    "flux jumping has been numerously studied in conventional and high - temperature superconductors ( see the review papers @xcite , references therein , and the recent experimental studies @xcite ) . in the general case",
    "two types of flux jumps can be considered , namely , the global and the local flux jumps .",
    "a global flux jump involves vortices into motion in the entire volume of the sample .",
    "a local flux jump happens in a small fraction of the sample volume .",
    "depending on the initial perturbation and the driving parameters there are two qualitatively different types of global flux jumps , namely , complete and partial flux jumps .",
    "the first turns the superconductor to the normal state .",
    "the second self - terminates when the temperature is still less than the critical temperature .",
    "we illustrate a global flux jump origination treating a superconducting slab with the thickness @xmath6 subjected to an external magnetic field @xmath7 parallel to the sample surface ( @xmath8 plane ) . in the framework of the bean s critical state model the space distribution of the flux",
    "is given by the equation @xmath9 where the @xmath10 stays for @xmath11 and @xmath12 correspondingly .",
    "we show the dependence @xmath13 in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] for the case , when the critical current density depends only on the temperature , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath14 .",
    "let us now suppose that the temperature of the sample @xmath15 is increased by a small perturbation @xmath16 arising due to a certain initial heat release @xmath17 .",
    "the critical current density @xmath18 is a decreasing function of temperature .",
    "thus , the density of the superconducting current screening of the external magnetic field at @xmath19 is less than at @xmath20 .",
    "this reduction of the screening current leads to a rise of the magnetic flux inside the superconductor as it is shown in fig .",
    "the motion of the magnetic flux into the sample , which occurs as a result of the temperature perturbation @xmath16 , induces an electric field perturbation @xmath21 .",
    "the arise of @xmath21 is accompanied by an additional heat release @xmath22 , an additional temperature rise @xmath23 , and , therefore , an additional reduction of the superconducting screening current density @xmath24 . under certain conditions",
    "it results in an avalanche - type increase of the temperature and the magnetic flux in the superconductor , _",
    "i.e. _ , in a global flux jump .    the relative effect of the flux and temperature redistribution dynamics on the flux jumping process depends on the ratio , @xmath25 , of the flux , @xmath26 , and thermal , @xmath27 , diffusion time constants @xcite .",
    "the value of the dimensionless parameter @xmath25 is determined by the corresponding diffusion coefficients and is equal to @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the heat conductivity , @xmath30 is the conductivity , and @xmath31 is the heat capacity .    for @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , rapid propagation of the flux is accompanied by an adiabatic heating of the superconductor , _",
    "i.e. _ , there is not enough time to redistribute and remove the heat released due to the flux motion .",
    "for @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , the space distribution of flux remains fixed during the stage of rapid heating .",
    "these adiabatic ( @xmath32 ) and dynamic ( @xmath34 ) approximations are the basis of the approach to the flux jumping problem @xcite and a flux jump scenario significantly depends on the relation between the values of the heat conductivity @xmath36 , heat capacity @xmath31 , and conductivity @xmath30 , that is determined by the slope of the @xmath37-@xmath38 curve .",
    "let us now estimate the electric field value typical for the magnetization experiments . in this case",
    "the external magnetic field ramp rate @xmath1 is usually from the interval",
    "@xmath39  ts@xmath40 . the background electric field , @xmath41 , induced by the magnetic field variation is of the order of @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the width of the area occupied by the critical state ( see , for example , fig .  [ f1 ] ) .",
    "we estimate @xmath41 as @xmath44  vcm@xmath40 using the value @xmath46  m which is typical for the stability domain of the bean s critical state .",
    "this electric field interval corresponds to the flux creep regime .",
    "therefore , for the magnetization experiments the background electric field @xmath41 is from the flux creep regime , where the relation between the current density , @xmath37 , and the electric field , @xmath38 , is strongly nonlinear . as a result",
