    "these mechanisms usually rely on cross - gain saturation effects .",
    "however , mode interaction in semiconductor cavities may also result from stimulated scattering due to a dynamic carrier population grating in the gain medium , which oscillates at the beat note frequency between adjacent cavity modes ( @xmath4 ghz ) .",
    "such interaction , known as the `` bogatov effect '' , is asymmetrical in the sense that the laser mode at the blue side of the spectrum transfers its energy to the mode at the red side @xcite .",

    "the coupled nanolasers are optically pumped at room temperature .",
    "we use optical periodic ( 50 khz - repetition rate ) and incoherent ( @xmath55 nm ) pumping consisting either of a ramp for the acquisition of the output vs. input power ( ll - curve ) or short pulses ( @xmath56 ps - pulse duration ) to perform statistics on the output pulse energies . in both cases , the pump spot is located at the center of the coupled cavity system .",

    "this plot consists of a superposition of 40 sequences of quasi - cw pumping .",
    "it can be clearly observed that , at threshold , lasing takes place on the b - mode , demonstrating that it has higher net gain as expected . in fig .",
    "[ switch - quasicw]a the b mode loses stability and turns off at p @xmath61 2.5p@xmath62 , while the ab mode turns on right after .",
    "this reveals energy transfer from the blue - detuned to the red - detuned mode .",
    "in addition we observe that , from sequence to sequence , the instability threshold fluctuates in a range 2.1 @xmath63 p / p@xmath62 @xmath63 2.9 .",
    "once the bifurcation point is crossed , the system remains stable on the ab - mode up to large values of the pumping .",

    "one of the fixed points @xmath84 is stable ( node ) and the other one unstable ( saddle ) , and depending on the sign of @xmath94 the stable one will be bonding ( @xmath95 ) or anti - bonding ( @xmath96 ) .",

    "the switching point takes place at a single point @xmath102 since the switching mechanism is represented by an exchange of stability between the two solutions .",
    "first , the presence of spontaneous emission modifies this picture and induces a `` transition region '' in the pump parameter with a nonzero measure .",

    "i.e. for finite k - values , the switching mechanism becomes more complex : a non - trivial connection of b and ab solutions in phase space comes up as the pump parameter is varied",

    "[ eq : alr ] and [ eq : nlr ] , shown in fig .",
    "it can be observed that the stable b - mode undergoes a supercritical hopf bifurcation at p @xmath49 3.765 p@xmath62 .",
    "in other words , there is a switching zone ( see the inset of fig .  [",
    "theo]c ) where the only stable solution is a limit cycle , which manifests itself as a cavity beating at the rabi frequency .",
    "this limit cycle , in presence of noise , is the nonlinear dynamical representation of the soft transition region from the blue - detuned to the red - detuned mode where the coupled nanolasers operate in a dual - frequency regime . such a fast nonlinear beating dynamically delocalizes photons in the coupled cavity system . as a result",
    "strong anti - correlated intensity fluctuations for b and ab modes are expected , which is consistent with the observed minimum of the cross - correlation function at the switching point ( fig .",
    "[ g2_exp ] ) .",
    "hence , we conclude that the observation of a dip in the mode cross - correlation is the statistical consequence of a dual frequency operation region given by an ultrafast ( @xmath117 thz ) noisy limit cycle rather than , for instance , bi - stable mode switching scenarios previously reported for bi - modal microlasers @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have revealed for the first time asymmetric energy transfer between eigenmodes in a semiconductor photonic dimer .",
    "we have experimentally shown that a mode switching occurs from the blue - detuned ( bonding ) to the red - detuned ( anti - bonding ) modes as the pump power is increased .",
    "we have identified the basic mechanism underlying such mode interaction as a `` discrete bogatov effect '' , i.e. the asymmetric stimulated light scattering induced by two - site population oscillations at the optical rabi frequency .",
    "the predicted scaling of the onset of switching with respect to the coupling parameter in a mean - field model is shown to be in good agreement with the experimental results for different coupling strengths .",
    "we claim that this phenomenon is generic in semiconductor coupled cavities , and dominates against cross - gain saturation effects , therefore it could be used to model nonlinear mode coupling in probabilistic theories such as bimodal birth - death models in micro / nano - laser photonic dimers .",
    "furthermore , it should also be scalable to n - coupled cavities , such that energy can be expected to flow from the blue - most to the red - most hybrid modes of the photonic molecule with the increase of pump power .",

    "<S> two coupled - cavity systems , or `` photonic dimers '' , are efficient test - beds for both fundamental optics the realization of quantum correlated states , josephson physics , and so forth , and applications such as optical flip - flop memories . in this work we report on the first observation of nonlinear mode interaction in a photonic dimer formed by two semiconductor photonic crystal coupled nanolasers . for this , we investigate energy transfer between hybrid modes , which manifests as a switching from the blue - detuned ( bonding ) to the red - detuned ( anti - bonding ) modes . </S>",
    "<S> an mean - field model allows us to explain this phenomenon as stimulated scattering due to carrier population oscillations in the cavities at the rabi frequency . </S>",
    "<S> such asymmetrical mode interaction is universal in semiconductor laser photonic molecules , and unveils the origin of cross - correlation dips in the statistics of mode fluctuations . </S>"
