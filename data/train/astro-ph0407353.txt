    "in this talk i report on the recent joint work with takahashi@xcite .",
    "the cosmic concordance of data from three disparate sources : cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , large scale structure ( lss ) and type ia supernovae ( sneia ) suggests that the present values of the dark energy and matter components , in terms of the critical density , are approximately @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the equation of state of the dark energy @xmath3 suggests the possibility that @xmath4 , first studied by caldwell@xcite and subsequently in a number of papers@xcite .",
    "the conclusion about the make - up of our universe depends on assuming that general relativity(gr ) is applicable at the largest cosmological scales .",
    "although there is good evidence for gr at solar - system scales@xcite there is no independent evidence for gr at scales comparable to the radius of the visible universe .",
    "the expansion rate of the universe , including the present accelerating rate of cosmic expansion can be parameterized in the right - hand side of the friedmann equation by including a dark energy density term with some assumed time dependence on the scale parameter @xmath5 : @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "this is a rather restricted function if we assume that the equation of state @xmath8 is time - independent .",
    "but as soon as we admit that it may depend on time @xmath9 then the function on the right hand side of the friedmann equation becomes completely arbitrary , just as does its designation as a dark energy density .",
    "present data are fully consistent with constant @xmath10 corresponding to a cosmological constant which we may accommodate on the left hand side of the friedmann equation describing the expansion rate of the universe . but",
    "cases with @xmath11 , including @xmath4 , are still permitted by observations . in this case , there is a choice between cooking up a `` dark energy '' density with a particular time dependence @xmath12 on the right - hand side of the friedmann equation or changing the left - hand - side by changing the relationship between the geometry and the matter density , _",
    "i.e. _ by changing gr .",
    "even if we do the latter , from the viewpoint of the friedmann equation , we can always find a time - dependent term on the right - hand - side which is equivalent and which we may call `` dark energy '' and thus preserve gr in some form .",
    "eventually , this distinction may come down to observational tests of whether a particular change in the geometry predicted by gr can be detected , other than by the expansion rate of the universe .",
    "the case constant @xmath4 has the interesting outcome for the future of the universe that it will end in a finite time at a `` big rip '' before which all structure disintegrates@xcite .    in the present article",
    ", we shall study an amalgam of the modification of gr due to dvali , gabadadze and porrati@xcite ( dgp ) and the idea of a big rip , in fact here a bigger rip .",
    "this will be based on admittedly _ ad hoc _",
    "ansatz for terms in modified friedmann equations but the results are sufficiently interesting to examine and such modifications may be constrained by observational data .",
    "the dgp gravity@xcite arises from considering the four - dimensional gravity which arises from five - dimensional general relativity confined to a brane with three space dimensions .",
    "the underlying action is :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the scalar curvature in 5- and 4- dimensional spacetime respectively , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the determinant of the 5- and 4- dimensional spacetime metric .",
    "this leads to an interesting modification of gr which embodies a time - dependent length scale @xmath18 .",
    "for cosmology it is natural to identify , within a coefficient of order one , @xmath0 with the hubble length @xmath19 at any cosmological time @xmath20 .",
    "actually we are slightly generalizing the original dgp approach to include time dependence of the length scale @xmath0 .    taking the four dimensional coordinates to be labeled by @xmath21",
    "leads to the following modification of einstein s equation :    @xmath22 = 0 \\label{einstein}\\ ] ]    where [ ( ... ) ] means : @xmath23 \\equiv f^{'}(0 ) \\delta(x ) .",
    "\\label{distribution}\\ ] ]    it is interesting to generalize the schwarzschild solution to this modification of gr@xcite .",
    "one finds that the modification of the newton potential at short distances is given by :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "the fractional change in the newtonian gravitational potential at cosmological time @xmath20 at orbital distance @xmath26 from an object with schwarzschild radius @xmath27 is therefore    @xmath28    in the bigger rip scenario we will describe the characteristic length @xmath0 will decrease with time according to @xmath29 where the power satisfies @xmath30 ( @xmath31 implies that @xmath0 would _ increase _ ) and where @xmath32 in which @xmath33 is the time of the rip . a bound system will become unbound at a time @xmath34 when the correction to the newtonian potential becomes large .",
    "we make adopt the value of @xmath34 defined from eq.([deltav ] ) by @xmath35 we can rewrite eq.([tu ] ) as : @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "we shall define another later time @xmath38 as the time after which the two objects of a bound system become causally disconnected from @xmath38 until @xmath33 .",
    "this is defined by the equation : @xmath39    as an example taking @xmath40 with the values @xmath41 and @xmath42 we arrive at the entries in the following table :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note that for the @xmath43 case we have tabulated the difference @xmath44 rather than @xmath45 because in this case the expansion is so rapid .",
    "next we turn to observational constraints on the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 for @xmath43 .",
    "in the previous section , we discussed the future universe in the model . in this section , we discuss constraints on model parameters from sneia data . to discuss the constraint",
    ", we have to include other component such as cold dark matter ( cdm ) and baryon . including all components ,",
    "we can write the friedmann equation as @xcite @xmath48 if we define the density parameter @xmath49 , we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ modfriedmann ] ) as @xmath50\\ ] ] where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are defined as @xmath53 thus at the present time , we have the relation among the density parameters , @xmath54    to obtain a constraint from the sneia observations , we assume that red - shift dependence of @xmath52 is as in eq .",
    "( [ rhox ] ) and that @xmath55 is dependent on time as eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) ; thus we can say that we consider a new component @xmath56 which is defined as eq.([rhox ] ) .",
    "now we discuss the constraint on this model from sneia data using recent result @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , we show contours of 95 and 99 % c.l . in @xmath52-@xmath57 plane for @xmath58 ( which is the constant @xmath55 case ) , 0.5 and 1 with @xmath43 . in the figure , we also plot the line for the flat universe .",
    "notice that the line is different from the standard case because we have the modified friedmann equation in this model . to obtain the constraint , we marginalize the hubble parameter dependence by minimizing @xmath59 for the fit .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , we show the constraint on @xmath60-@xmath61 plane assuming the flat universe ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "if we take the value @xmath63 , we can find an upper limit for @xmath61 which is @xmath64 .",
    "this implies that the time remaining from now until the rip is constrained to be generically at least somewhat longer than the current age . if we make @xmath46 larger than the length corresponding to the age of the universe then the upper bound on @xmath47 diminishes and hence the time until the rip increases .",
    "we note that because the effective equation of state @xmath9 is varying with time its present value @xmath65 can be more negative than allowed by constraints derived from assuming constant @xmath8 . our constraint on @xmath66 permits @xmath67 to be as negative as @xmath68 for @xmath43 .",
    "assuming constant @xmath8 , on the other hand , gives @xcite @xmath69 .",
    "the present article is a natural sequel to our previous paper @xcite about dark energy in which it was pointed out that no amount of observational data can , by itself , tell us the fate of dark energy if we allow for an arbitrarily varying equation of state .",
    "the three possibilities listed were : there may firstly be a big rip , or secondly dark energy may dominate but with an infinite lifetime or thirdly the dark energy may eventually disappear leaving a matter - dominated universe . given that observational data are insufficient , only a successful and convincing theory of the past may inform of the future of the universe .",
    "the big rip was the most exotic of the fates and there seemed tied to a phantom @xmath4 dark energy .",
    "however , here we have studied a bigger rip , in which the scale factor is even more divergent at a future finite time than for the big rip , which is achieved by modifying gravity and omitting dark energy . in the model , as with the phantom case , structures become unbound and subsequently their components become causally disconnected before the universe is torn apart in the rip .",
    "if we allow an arbitrarily - varying equation of state any new term on the left - hand - side of the friedmann equation can apparently be taken to the right - hand - side and reinterpreted as a dark energy .",
    "but this will , in general , lead to a relationship between pressure and energy which is not truly simple , but very complicated as in eq.([w(t ) ] ) above .",
    "we use the term `` dark energy '' when the time dependence of such a term governing the expansion rate of the universe is sufficiently simple , _",
    "e.g. _ it could be required that @xmath9 is either constant or at most polynomial in @xmath20 .",
    "this is not the case for the present model and hence justifies the title chosen for this article .",
