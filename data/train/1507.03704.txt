    "<S> the lhcb collaboration at the large hadron collider at cern discovered two pentaquark states @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these two hidden - charm states are interpreted as the loosely bound @xmath2 and @xmath3 molecular states in the boson exchange interaction model , which provides an explanation for why the experimental width of @xmath1 is much narrower than that of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of the new resonances @xmath0 and @xmath1 , indeed , opens a new page for hadron physics . the partners of @xmath0 and @xmath1 should be pursued in future experiments .    in the pioneer paper @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , gell - mann indicated that the multiquark states should exist along with the simplest structures for baryons which are composed of three valence quarks and mesons which contain a quark and an antiquark . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , from the point of either mathematics or physics , there is nothing to forbid the existence of such exotic states . in quantum mechanics , </S>",
    "<S> the multiquark states are nothing new but just higher fock states . in gauge field theory , </S>",
    "<S> the qcd principle allows the existence of multiquark states and hybrids which contain not only quarks but also gluonic degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the multiquark states might be suppressed by higher orders of @xmath4 in perturbative qcd . </S>",
    "<S> however , the confinement is a totally non - perturbative qcd effects . </S>",
    "<S> such suppression is not so drastic . unless nature prefers the simplest structures , one has reason to believe that the multiquark states should exist .    from the aspects of both theory and experiment , </S>",
    "<S> the ground state mesons and baryons are well arranged in the simplest structures : singlets and octets for mesons , octets and decuplets for baryons . </S>",
    "<S> no flavor exotic states have been observed or required to exist . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the mesons whose masses are above 1 gev , the mixtures among regular quark structures and hybrids , glueballs , and multiquark states should be non - zero in order to fit the spectra @xcite .    in 2003 , </S>",
    "<S> the leps collaboration reported the evidence of the strange pentaquark state with the quark content @xmath5 and very narrow width @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately this flavor exotic state was not confirmed by subsequent experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the possible theoretical arguments for the non - existence of the stable strange pentaquarks were given in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . up to now </S>",
    "<S> , no stable light flavor pentaquark states have been found , but light flavor baryons probably have significant pentaquark components @xcite .    in the past decade </S>",
    "<S> , the researches have rounded the corner . </S>",
    "<S> many mesonic @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 particles have been observed at belle , babar , besiii and lhcb . </S>",
    "<S> some of them are identified as exotic candidates because they can not be accommodated in the regular @xmath9 structures . </S>",
    "<S> corresponding review papers can be found in recent literature ( for example , see a recent review in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> a common point is that all those exotic states which are interpreted as molecular states , tetraquarks or even four quarks in an anarchy state , contain heavy quarks and antiquarks .    in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the heavy quarks play an important role to in stabilizing the multiquark systems , just as in the case of the hydrogen molecule in qed . </S>",
    "<S> there were the theoretical predictions of hidden - charm pentaquarks @xcite , especially the possible hidden - charm molecular baryons with the components of an anti - charmed meson and a charmed baryon which were investigated systematically within the one boson exchange model in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> because of the existence of heavy quarks , the multiquark exotic states can survive and light exotic states must mix with the regular ones , instead @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this conjecture is consistent with the fact that all the exotic states which have been experimentally observed contain hidden charm or bottom . </S>",
    "<S> of course , if the allegation that the heavy components stabilize multiquark systems , is valid , one suggestion would be natural , that we should persuade our experimental colleagues to search for exotic states which contain open charm or bottom , for example , @xmath10 etc . </S>",
    "<S> another trend is also obvious , that one should be convinced that even though the light pentaquark does not individually exist , a pentaquark containing heavy flavors would be possible and has a large probability to be observed in sophisticated experimental facilities .    </S>",
    "<S> very recently , the lhcb collaboration observed two resonance structures @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the @xmath11 invariant mass spectrum of @xmath12 @xcite , and their resonance parameters are @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 . according to their final state @xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> , we conclude that the two observed @xmath17 must not be an isosinglet state , and the two @xmath17 states contain hidden - charm quantum numbers . </S>",
    "<S> a more important feature of these two @xmath17 states is that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are close to the thresholds of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we propose that the novel resonances reported by the lhcb collaboration can be identified as the exotic hidden - charm pentaquarks with the @xmath18 and @xmath19 molecular configurations . </S>",
    "<S> for the @xmath18 and @xmath19 systems , the flavor wave functions @xmath20 are defined as @xmath21 where only these flavors of wave functions with isospin </S>",
    "<S> @xmath22 match the discussed @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we perform a dynamical calculation of the structures of @xmath18 and @xmath19 where the constituents interact via one pion exchange ( ope ) @xcite . the solution might help to confirm whether or not bound states for these s - wave @xmath18 and @xmath19 systems exist . to establish the effective potential which is responsible for binding the constituents , we adopt the following effective lagrangians @xmath23 ,       \\label{lag01}\\\\ \\mathcal{l}_{\\mathcal{s } } & = & -\\frac{3}{2}g_1\\varepsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\lambda\\kappa}v_{\\kappa}\\text{tr }        \\left[\\bar{\\mathcal{s}}_{\\mu}a_{\\nu}\\mathcal{s}_{\\lambda}\\right ] , \\label{lag02}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which are constructed under the heavy quark limit and chiral symmetry @xcite . here , the notation @xmath24\\frac{1-\\rlap\\slash v}{2}$ ] with @xmath25 stands for the multiplet field composed of the pseudoscalar @xmath26 and vector @xmath27 with @xmath28 . and </S>",
    "<S> the next superfield @xmath29 is composed of spinor operators as @xmath30 , where the notations @xmath31 and @xmath32 are defined as multiplets which , respectively , correspond to @xmath33 and @xmath34 in @xmath35 flavor representations . </S>",
    "<S> the axial current @xmath36 is defined as @xmath37 with @xmath38 , and the pion decay constant @xmath39 mev is taken . additionally , the matrices @xmath40 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 read as @xmath41    expanding eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lag01 ] ) and ( [ lag02 ] ) , further , we can further get the direct effective lagrangian which will be applied to our later calculation , i.e. , @xmath42,\\\\ \\mathcal{l}_{\\mathcal{b}_6^*\\mathcal{b}_6^*\\mathbb{p } } & = &        -i\\frac{3g_1}{2f_{\\pi}}\\varepsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\lambda\\kappa}v_{\\kappa }        \\text{tr}\\left[\\bar{\\mathcal{b}}_{6\\mu}^{*}\\partial_{\\nu}\\mathbb{p }        \\mathcal{b}_{6\\nu}^*\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is extracted from the width of @xmath44 @xcite as is done in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and @xmath45 was fixed in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    with the above preparation </S>",
    "<S> , the ope - based potentials for the @xmath18 and @xmath19 systems are deduced , which can be related to the scattering amplitude of the @xmath46 and @xmath47 processes under adopting the breit approximation and performing the fourier transformation @xcite , where the monopole form factor @xmath48 is introduced to compensate the off shell effect of the exchanged meson and describe the structure effect of each effective vertex . in this form factor </S>",
    "<S> , there is a phenomenological parameter @xmath49 which plays an equivalent role as the cut - off in the pauli - villas renormalization scheme and must be fixed by fitting data . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss this , later . finally , the general expressions of effective potentials for the @xmath50 and @xmath51 systems are @xmath52 respectively , where the @xmath53 function is defined as @xmath54 in eqs . </S>",

    "<S> cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     by solving the schrdinger equation with the obtained effective potentials @xcite , we can reproduce the masses of @xmath0 and @xmath1 as shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ energy ] ( a ) and [ energy ] ( b ) , which supports the allegation that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are hidden - charm molecular states @xmath50 with @xmath64 and @xmath51 with @xmath65 , respectively .    with these assignments to the two observed @xmath0 and @xmath1 , their @xmath11 decay modes can be naturally interpreted as the @xmath50 in @xmath64 and the @xmath51 in @xmath65 ; the molecular states can transit into @xmath11 via exchanging an @xmath59-wave charmed meson .    </S>",
    "<S> let us investigate the decays further , where the @xmath50 state with @xmath64 and the @xmath51 state with @xmath65 transit into @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> in the first process , the products @xmath66 and @xmath67 reside in an s - wave , whereas , for the second mode , because the spin of @xmath1 is 5/2 , the final @xmath66 and @xmath67 must be in a @xmath68-wave to guarantee conservation of total angular momentum .    </S>",
    "<S> usually , a @xmath68-wave decay is suppressed compared with an @xmath59-wave decay . </S>",
    "<S> thus we can qualitatively explain why the width of @xmath1 is much narrower than that of @xmath0 @xcite invariant mass spectrum around 4450 mev is very complicated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility is that @xmath1 could be the @xmath26-wave excitation of the @xmath59-wave @xmath50 molecular states which decays into @xmath11 mainly via @xmath26-wave . </S>",
    "<S> hence its decay width is not very large . ] . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , a similar decay mode of these two hidden - charm molecular pentaquarks is @xmath69 , which is a @xmath68-wave decay mode , where @xmath70 denotes a nucleon .     </S>",
    "<S> systems to @xmath71 , and obtained bound state solutions . here , the masses of @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be reproduced well under the @xmath50 with @xmath64 and @xmath51 with @xmath65 molecular assignments , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath72 gev and @xmath73 gev are taken for the @xmath50 and @xmath51 systems , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the blue curves are the effective potentials , and the red line stands for the corresponding energy levers . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the obtained spatial wave functions are given here . , title=\"fig:\",width=336 ] +    besides explaining the observed @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we further predict two hidden - charm molecular pentaquarks ( see fig . </S>",

    "<S> we notice that the the ope effective potential is the same for the @xmath50 system with @xmath64 and the @xmath50 system with @xmath74 , and the only difference comes from their isospin and spin combinations . </S>",
    "<S> if taking the same parameters as input , we find that a binding energy ( @xmath75 mev ) of the @xmath50 system with @xmath74 is the same as that of the @xmath50 system with @xmath64 . in addition , we also find a bound - state solution for the @xmath51 system with @xmath74 with a binding energy of @xmath76 mev if taking the same parameters as for the case of the @xmath51 system with @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , there may exist two extra hidden - charm molecular pentaquarks , the @xmath50 state with @xmath74 and the @xmath51 state with @xmath74 , which are the isospin parters of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .    </S>",

    "<S> several pentaquarks with hidden - bottom @xmath90 and the @xmath100-like pentaquarks @xmath98 and @xmath99 , which can be considered as the partners of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , are predicted . </S>",
    "<S> experimental exploration of these predicted exotic states is a potential and important research topic for future lhcb experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> certainly , it is not the end of the story for the charmed and bottom pentaquarks . </S>",
    "<S> the discovery and theoretical studies on @xmath0 and @xmath1 are just opening a new page of hadron physics . in the coming years </S>",
    "<S> , joint theoretical and experimental efforts will be helpful in pushing the relevant study on pentaquarks with heavy flavors , which will deepen our understanding of non - perturbative qcd behavior further . </S>"
