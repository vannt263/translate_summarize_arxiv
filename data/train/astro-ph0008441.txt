    "the arches ( g0.121 + 0.017 ) and quintuplet ( afgl 2004 ) clusters are two extraordinary star clusters near the galactic center .",
    "they are very young ( @xmath5  myr ) , compact ( @xmath6  pc ) , and only 2030 parsecs away from the galactic center ( gc ) in projection , while they appear to be as massive as the smallest galactic globular clusters ( @xmath7 ; figer et al .",
    "these compact young clusters ( cycs ) have several interesting dynamical characteristics that distinguish them from globular clusters : 1 ) cycs have very short dynamical and half - mass relaxation timescales ( @xmath8  yr and @xmath9  yr , respectively ) ; 2 ) cycs are situated in strong tidal fields ( the tidal radius of a @xmath10 cluster located 30  pc from the galactic center is @xmath11  pc ) ; and 3 ) mass segregation may occur on a timescale shorter than the lifetimes of the most massive stars , such that those massive stars play an important role in the dynamical evolution of the cluster ( for more details on timescales and the effects of tidal fields , see kim , morris , & lee , 1999 ; hereafter kml ) .",
    "the fact that we currently observe only two such young clusters near the gc ( in addition to the central cluster right at the gc ) raises a natural question about the lifetimes of cycs . using anisotropic fokker - planck ( f - p ) models , kml surveyed lifetimes of cycs for various initial mass functions ( imfs ) , cluster masses ( @xmath12 ) , and galactocentric radii ( @xmath13 ) , and found that clusters with @xmath14 and @xmath15  pc evaporate in @xmath16  myr .",
    "these unparalleled , short evaporation times ( @xmath17 ; defined here as the time by which @xmath12 , the cluster mass inside the tidal radius , becomes 5  % of its initial value ) of cycs are first due to short @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and strong tidal forces , but the mass loss accompanying the evolution of massive stars is also responsible for shortening @xmath17 of clusters that last longer than @xmath20  myr .",
    "f - p models are statistical models involving distribution functions .",
    "it is the statistical stability and fast computing time of the f - p models that the survey - type study by kml required .",
    "takahashi & portegies zwart ( 1998 ) found good agreement between anisotropic f - p models and n - body simulations for globular clusters by adopting an `` apocenter criterion '' and an appropriate coefficient for the speed of star removal beyond the tidal radius ( kml adopted these as well ) .",
    "however , some extreme conditions of cycs may be inconsistent with the assumptions inherent to f - p models . as discussed in kml ,",
    "the conditions required by f - p models , @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is the stellar evolution timescale ) may be violated , especially in the core at certain epochs . moreover , the active participation of a large mass range of stars in the dynamics , which is another peculiarity of cycs , is difficult to realize in f - p models that embody a mass spectrum with a restricted number ( usually 10 - 20 ) of discrete mass components",
    ". a greater number of components would better express the mass spectrum , but then the computation time would become accordingly longer . on the other hand ,",
    "too small a number of components would not properly realize the whole mass spectrum . by fixing the number of stars in the most massive components , kml tried to carefully account for a relatively small number of the most massive stars . yet , the results from such a treatment are to be confirmed by more realistic models , n - body simulations .",
    "cycs , estimated to have @xmath24 stars , are one of a few classes of systems for which real - number n - body simulations are feasible on current workstations . among many virtues of n - body simulations , the natural realization of the mass spectrum and the tidal fields is particularly beneficial to the study of cycs .",
    "these benefits allow n - body simulations to treat mass segregation and evaporation of stars exactly , thus providing better density profiles and mass spectra as a function of radius . these are photometric observables , and are partially available from the",
    "_ hst_/nicmos observations of the arches and quintuplet ( figer et al . 1999 ; the partial availability is owed to crowding at the cluster center and to the detection limit at the faint end of the luminosity function ) .",
    "the arches and quintuplet are estimated to be only @xmath25 and @xmath26  myr old , respectively ( figer et al . 1999 ) , but their currently observed structures must already have deviated from the initial ones due to their rapid dynamical evolution . with both real - number n - body simulations and hst observations of the two clusters in hand , one has a rare chance of deriving not only the current characteristics of these systems , but their initial conditions as well .    in the present study , we perform a series of n - body simulations 1 ) to compare the lifetimes of cycs with those from f - p models obtained by kml , 2 ) to find the initial cluster conditions that best match the current observations of cycs , and 3 ) to test the effects of initial mass segregation and different initial density profiles on the dynamical evolution of the cycs .",
    "for n - body simulations in the present study , we use the most recent version of aarseth s n - body codes , nbody6 ( aarseth 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "we modified the nbody6 codes to implement the full , non - truncated tidal forces , and we adopted the prescription for stellar evolution used in kml for consistency ( see kml for details on the stellar evolution ) .",
    "the upper stellar mass limit , @xmath27 , is @xmath28 , and the lower mass limit , @xmath29 , is @xmath30 or @xmath31 .",
    "we set the cluster to initially fill the tidal radius , and remove stars outside 5 times the tidal radius .    for initial conditions of the cluster and the galactic tidal field , we also follow prescriptions of kml : we adopt single - mass king models ( with a king parameter @xmath32 ) and single power - law mass functions ; the galactic mass @xmath33 inside a galactocentric radius @xmath13 is given by @xmath34 ( from genzel & townes , 1987 )",
    ". then the tidal radius of the cluster , @xmath35 , becomes @xmath36 the equations of motions are integrated in the rotating frame , and tidal forces are calculated from the galactic potential corresponding to equation  ( [ bulgemass ] ) .",
    "in order to compare @xmath17 of n - body and f - p calculations , we performed n - body simulations of several representative models in kml that have number of stars , @xmath37 , smaller than @xmath38 .",
    "this criterion excludes @xmath39 models with the exponent of the power - law imf , @xmath40 ( defined as in @xmath41 ) , larger than or equal to 2 .",
    "the lifetimes of 9 n - body simulations performed in the present study are shown in table  [ table : nbody2fp ] along with those from f - p calculations of kml .",
    "smaller than a few thousands .",
    "we find that our models have fluctuations from one run to the next mostly smaller than 10  % .",
    "such relatively small fluctuations are due to our definition of @xmath17 ( see   [ sec : intro ] ) , which avoids the late phase of the evolution that suffers most from statistical fluctuations .",
    "] this set of 9 models represent different @xmath12 ( models 1 & 5 ) , different @xmath40 ( models 1 , 8 , 13 , & 23 ) , different @xmath29 ( models 3 & 8 ; models 13 & 15 ) , and different @xmath13 ( models 13 , 43 , & 44 ) .",
    "we find that n - body calculations always give longer @xmath17 than f - p calculations , and that the fractional difference of @xmath17 between two calculations , @xmath42 ( @xmath43  [ nbody - fp]/nbody ) , does not show any particular correlation with @xmath37 .",
    "the biggest @xmath42 , 59  % , is for model 43 , for which the imf is quite flat ( @xmath44 ) and the cluster evaporates before significant stellar evolution starts .",
    "this implies that @xmath42 is larger for smaller @xmath40 ( compare to model 5 , which has as short @xmath17 as model 43 but @xmath42 of only 8  % ) , but that the stellar evolution has the effect of diminishing @xmath42 ( cf .",
    "model 44 , which also has @xmath45 but @xmath42 of only 16  % ) .",
    "we performed the n - body and f - p calculations for model 13 without stellar evolution , and find that the new @xmath17 s are 4.5 and 2.5  myr , respectively ( model 13 is our baseline model because we later find that it best matches the observations ; see ",
    "[ sec : init ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the speed of the pure ( i.e. , no stellar evolution ) dynamical evolution of f - p models by kml is considerably overestimated .",
    "we attribute shorter @xmath17 s of f - p calculations to the underestimated choice of @xmath46 ( the number of stars in the most massive bin ; the same as @xmath47 when the number of mass bins , @xmath48 , is 15 as in kml ) by kml .",
    "the mass bins of f - p models by kml were chosen to make @xmath46 constant , so that the significance of the most massive bins of models with different imfs would be the same .",
    "the larger @xmath46 , the smaller the characteristic mass of the most massive bin , thus the smaller the effective mass range ( the lower and upper mass limits are not a function of @xmath46 ) . since a larger effective mass range gives faster mass segregation and thus faster ejection of lighter stars , a smaller @xmath46 results in smaller @xmath17 .",
    "for @xmath48 can not be infinitely large for a practical reason , f - p models have difficulties with dealing with a very large mass range , and f - p results may depend on the way of binning the mass with a limited number of components ( bins ) .",
    "the choice of @xmath49 in kml was arbitrary , and one may tune the f - p @xmath17 values to n - body @xmath17 values by controlling this parameter .",
    "we find that a new f - p calculation for model 13 with no stellar evolution and @xmath50 gives a @xmath17 value that matches the n - body results without stellar evolution , 4.5  myr . in conclusion ,",
    "the choice of @xmath49 in kml was too small , thus kml underestimated @xmath17 , but such underestimation was not significant for most cases because the amount of mass loss from stellar evolution after @xmath25  myr accelerates the evaporation of clusters .",
    "figure  [ fig : rho ] compares the volume density profiles of n - body and f - p calculations for model 13 at 1 and 2  myr . for this",
    "f - p calculations , @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( instead of 15 as in kml ) were used . for @xmath51 ,",
    "@xmath48 larger than 10 would give negative @xmath53 values ( see kml for definition of @xmath53 ; a negative @xmath53 gives smaller numbers of stars for lighter mass bins ) . at @xmath54  myr ,",
    "the two density profiles differ only near and outside @xmath35 ( the small deviation at the core is probably due to small number statistics ) , but the f - p calculation significantly underestimates the density outside @xmath35 . at @xmath55  myr ,",
    "the deviation starts at smaller radii , and the power - law slope of the f - p density profile is steeper than the n - body slope by 0.3 to 0.4 inside @xmath35 .",
    "such a difference makes the cluster mass inside the tidal radius of the f - p calculation always somewhat smaller than that of the n - body calculation .",
    "figure  [ fig : mtot ] compares the evolution of cluster mass inside the tidal radius , @xmath12 , of n - body and f - p calculations for model 13 .",
    "stellar evolution was not included in these calculations in order to see the effect of tidal fields only , and @xmath56 and @xmath52 were used for the f - p calculation .",
    "the figure shows that the mass loss rate from the cluster differs especially during the early phase of evolution .",
    "we also find that the @xmath40 value of the f - p calculation decreases faster with time , having 0.1 to 0.3 smaller ( shallower mass function ) values , than those of the n - body simulation at most times .",
    "n - body models are more realistic than f - p models , whose observables are here found to have non - negligible discrepancies from n - body models ; therefore for comparison with the observed structures of the cycs , n - body simulations should be preferred over f - p models .",
    "in spite of the very young ages of the cycs , the observed properties of cycs should differ from their initial status because of the cluster s rapid dynamical evolution .",
    "thus one should compare numerical simulations of cluster evolution with observations to infer the initial conditions of the cluster . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : nbody2fp ] , n - body simulations provide the most accurate information on the dependence of the stellar distribution on stellar mass . in this section ,",
    "we use our n - body simulations to find initial conditions of the arches cluster from comparisons with _",
    "hst_/nicmos photometric observations by figer et al .",
    "the quintuplet cluster has a largely dispersed distribution ( probably because it is in the final disruption phase ) , so dynamical information from its image is very limited",
    ".    dynamical information from the photometric image of a cluster can be found from the surface density profiles and the mass distribution functions as a function of radius . when the photometry is complete down to the faintest stars , the overall stellar mass function , total cluster mass , and degree of mass segregation are obtained from the above two observables .",
    "however , the _ hst _ observations of the arches were limited by crowding in the core and by the background confusion in the outer regions . using the mass - k magnitude relation of meynet et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and adopting an extinction at k band of 3.1 , figer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) estimate that their _ hst _ arches photometry is complete down to @xmath57 for @xmath58 , or 0.12  pc , and to @xmath59 for @xmath60 , or 0.2  pc ( the distance to the gc is assumed to be 8  kpc in the present study ) , and that the background confusion limit lies between 3 and @xmath61 . for this reason",
    ", we only use stars having @xmath62 ( @xmath63  mag , where f205w is the undereddened , apparent vega magnitude of the nicmos f205w filter ) for the surface number density profile , and @xmath64 ( @xmath65  mag ) for estimating the mass spectrum .",
    "the number of stars heavier than @xmath66 outside its crowding limit , 0.2  pc , is 232 , which is not enough to give reliable information on the mass spectrum as a function of radius .",
    "therefore we adopt the simplest way of measuring the mass function and the mass segregation : we count the number of stars in two mass bins ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) , each in two radius bins ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) . in principle",
    ", one can find the initial conditions ( or several sets of initial conditions ) of a cluster by comparing these number counts and the density profiles of numerical simulations and observations .",
    "we start with imfs that give the observed number of massive stars , which , for the arches cluster , is expected to be very close to its initial value ( the estimated age of the arches , @xmath25  myr , is before significant stellar evolution ) .",
    "the observations require the imf to have @xmath37(@xmath71 ) of 150 ( @xmath72 stars are complete down to @xmath73  pc ) .",
    "the surface number density profiles for @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) at 1 or 2  myr , and the number count evolutions of n - body simulations of models 13 , 21 , and 22 are plotted in figures  [ fig : prof_alpha ] and [ fig : count_alpha ] along with observations ( the count numbers from observations are given in table  [ table : obscount ] ) .",
    "these three models have @xmath37(@xmath71 ) values of about 150 but different @xmath40 values ( see table [ table : init ] ) .",
    "@xmath75 plots in figure  [ fig : prof_alpha ] show that all three models agree well with the observation , which implies that our choice of the bulge mean density at the location of the cluster is appropriate because the mean bulge density determines the tidal radius of the cluster ( this does not necessarily prove that our choices of the bulge mass profile , eq .  [ [ bulgemass ] ] , and @xmath13 for these models , 30  pc , are correct since the bulge mean density is a combination of two parameters ; see below ) .",
    "the @xmath35 values of our n - body models shown in figure  [ fig : prof_alpha ] are 1.01.2  pc .",
    "figure  [ fig : count_alpha ] shows that the observed number counts best agree with model 13 ( @xmath45 ) at time @xmath542  myr .",
    "model 21 ( @xmath76 ) gives slightly smaller counts than observations , but considering the uncertainty in the mass - magnitude relation , we can not exclude the possibility that model 21 is applicable .",
    "on the other hand , model 22 ( @xmath77 ) significantly over - predicts the number of stars in lighter mass bins , except at @xmath78  myr , by which time the cluster would be in a disruption phase .",
    "we conclude that the best @xmath40 value suggested by these comparisons to observations is 1.75 .",
    "this finding may be , in fact , limited to the high mass regime only , where the comparison is actually made .",
    "however , for the above best - fit mass function , the stars with @xmath79 already consitute more than 70  % of the total mass , thus the above @xmath40 value may be considered representative .    the projected distance from the gc to the arches",
    "is @xmath80  pc , but the true distance is unknown . furthermore , the bulge mass distribution at a few tens of parsecs from the gc is uncertain . while the infrared light distribution observed by becklin & neugebauer ( 1968 ) implies a density profile @xmath81 ( eq .  [ [ bulgemass ] ] exhibits this profile ) , the radial velocity observations in radio frequencies for the same region suggest a shallower density drop ( @xmath82 ) between 30 and 100  pc , leading to a steeper enclosed - mass increase : @xmath83 ( lindqvist , habing , & winnberg 1992 ) .",
    "the tidal environment of the cluster is mostly determined by the mean density , @xmath84 .",
    "we performed the best - fit model found above ( @xmath45 ; model 13 ) with different tidal environments : models located at @xmath85  pc ( model 19 ) and 50  pc ( model 14 ) with our standard bulge mass distribution , equation  ( [ bulgemass ] ) .",
    "the latter is equivalent to the case of @xmath86  pc with a bulge mass distribution of equation  ( [ bulgemass2 ] ) .",
    "we find that @xmath75 of models 13 , 14 , and 19 can be all nicely fit to the observed @xmath75 at @xmath542  myr , and that the number counts of models 14 and 19 showed worse agreement to observations than model 13 , but the agreement was still at the acceptable level .",
    "we conclude that our comparisons do not rule out the possibility of @xmath87  pc and 50  pc , but favor the @xmath86  pc case",
    ".    model 15 has the same initial conditions as our best - fit model , model 13 , except @xmath39 instead of @xmath31 .",
    "we find that @xmath17 of model 15 is only @xmath88 longer than that of model 13 ( see table  [ table : init ] ) .",
    "this confirms the finding by kml that @xmath17 does not sensitively depend on @xmath29 when @xmath89 .",
    "this phenomenon is caused by two factors : 1 ) for a model with @xmath44 and @xmath90 , the mass between @xmath30 and @xmath31 constitutes only @xmath91 of the total mass , and 2 ) the lightest stars are rapidly ejected from the cluster during the early phases due to the large @xmath92 ratio . however ,",
    "the number counts of model 15 agree well with observations only after @xmath93  myr , by which time the arches cluster would be in the disruption phase and would have a structure as dispersed as the quintuplet .",
    "thus the observations more support our model with @xmath94 than @xmath30 .",
    "one of the most commonly used imfs for the galactic disk , the scalo mass function ( scalo 1986 ) , has @xmath95 for @xmath96 , implying that the best - fit @xmath40 value obtained here for the arches cluster is considerably flatter than that for the disk .",
    "this fact , together with @xmath94 being favored over @xmath97 , appears to support the arguments by morris ( 1993 ) that the non - standard star formation environment near the gc may lead to an imf skewed toward relatively massive stars and having an elevated lower mass cutoff .",
    "so far , we have not considered primordial binaries .",
    "camera 2 of the _ hst_/nicmos instrument ( used by figer et al .",
    "1999 ) has an angular resolution of about 1  pixel size of the detector ( @xmath98 ) , which is @xmath99  au at the distance of the gc .",
    "thus binary systems with a semi - major axis smaller than few hundred au are not resolved , and the presence of a significant number of primordial binaries in the cluster may affect our number count analysis above by decreasing number counts and/or by moving a primary star to a more massive mass bin ( the number of dynamical binaries , i.e. , binaries formed through close encounters , at a given moment is only a few , if any , for the whole cluster lifetime ) .",
    "to see the effects of primordial binaries on the number counts , we performed two simulations of model 13 with primordial binary fractions , @xmath100 , of 25  % and 50  % .",
    "the fraction is defined as @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the numbers of binary systems and single stars , respectively .",
    "thus the percentages of stars in binary systems for @xmath104  % and 50  % are 40  % and 67  % , respectively .",
    "these relatively ` moderate ' @xmath100 values , compared to @xmath105  % used in n - body simulations for open clusters ( kroupa , petr , & mccaughrean 1999 , for example ) may be justified by an argument by durisen & sterzik ( 1994 ) that binary formation from fragmentation of collapsing and rotating clouds or from a gravitational instability of massive protostellar disks is more likely in low - temperature clouds ( the central molecular zone in the inner few hundred pc of the galactic bulge has significantly elevated temperatures , @xmath106  k ) .",
    "the initial companion - mass - ratio distribution is obtained by random pairing of stars , and the initial eccentricity distribution is assumed to be thermally relaxed .",
    "for the initial period distribution , we adopt equation  ( 8) of kroupa ( 1995a ) , which approximates the distribution of binary systems in the galactic disk .",
    "this initial distribution is evolved prior to the start of the n - body integration to account for the  pre - main - sequence eigenevolution \" ( the evolution in orbital parameters due to internal processes such as tidal circularization during the pre - main - sequence ; see kroupa 1995a for details ) .",
    "we find that the @xmath17 values of @xmath104  % and 50  % models are slightly ( 1020  % ) longer than that of @xmath107  % model .",
    "this insensitivity of @xmath17 on @xmath100 was noted by mcmillan & hut ( 1994 ) , and kroupa ( 1995b ) .",
    "kroupa et al .",
    "( 1999 ) find that their model with @xmath108  % evolves slightly more slowly than that with @xmath109  % and interpret it due to cooling by disruption of wide binaries .",
    "the slightly longer @xmath17 s of our models with primordial binaries may be interpreted in the same way , but the reduced number of effective point sources due to binarity may be another possible explanation ( the rate of relaxation is proportional to @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the stellar mass ; when companions are picked out of a pool with a large mass range , the binarity does not significantly increase the @xmath111 of an ` effective point mass ' , while it considerably decreases @xmath37 of the effective point masses ) .    the number counts with a consideration of the angular resolution of the camera for @xmath104  % and 50  % models are compared to those of the @xmath107  % model in figure  [ fig : count_bin ] . here",
    ", the mass of a binary system with a semi - major axis smaller than the angular resolution is obtained from the total luminosity of the binary system , and the mass - luminosity relation adopted in figer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) is used for this calculation . while the number counts of the @xmath104  % model are only slightly smaller than the @xmath107  % model , those of the @xmath112  % model are 1040  % smaller . however ,",
    "these relatively smaller number counts of models with primordial binaries still agree with observed number counts at an acceptable level .",
    "furthermore , the difference of number counts between the @xmath107  % and 50  % models is larger for the more massive bin , implying that the initial @xmath40 should be smaller than that of the model tried here ( 1.75 ) in order for the @xmath112  % model to better match the observations . in conclusion ,",
    "the presence of primordial binaries will not significantly change our findings above on the best - fit initial conditions of the arches cluster , and our results indicate that the @xmath40 value found above for the case with no primordial binaries , 1.75 , is an upper limit .",
    "the prior sections of the present study and kml assumed , for simplicity , the same initial density profiles for all stellar masses , i.e. , no initial mass segregation .",
    "this assumption is , however , not based on any observational or theoretical evidence .",
    "interactions between stars during the star formation process determine the degree of initial mass segregation , which is therefore an important piece of information for the theory of cluster formation .",
    "however , different models lead to totally different predictions for initial segregation .",
    "the model by podsiadlowski & price ( 1992 ) , in which favorable stellar masses are determined by the ratio of the timescales for protostellar collisions and of gas infall onto the protostars , predicts more massive stars at larger radii . on the other hand , segregation of more massive stars in the core",
    "is predicted in some models such as the one by murray & lin ( 1996 ) , where encounters between cloudlets increase the protostellar masses , and the one by bonnell et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , where the deeper potential in the core causes stars there to accrete more circumstellar material .",
    "here we attempt both cases , one with heavy stars initially more prevalent at the core , the other with heavy stars more in the envelope .",
    "the initial density and velocity profiles of model 13 are modified to include the initial mass segregation : model 31 initially has a king profile with @xmath113 for the lightest stars and @xmath114 for the heaviest stars ( more heavy stars in the envelope ) while model 32 has the opposite @xmath115 values ( more heavy stars at the core ) .",
    "the intermediate - mass stars have interpolated @xmath115 values depending on the logarithm of their masses .",
    "we find that models 13 , 31 , & 32 show very similar @xmath75 profiles at 2  myr . in spite of different initial conditions ,",
    "the number counts of these three models also exhibit similar evolution after @xmath54  myr ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : count_seg ] ) .",
    "it appears that the relaxation processes are rapid enough to erase the memory of the initial mass segregation in less than 1  myr .",
    "thus unless the initial segregation is more severe than models tested here , the best - fit initial conditions found in ",
    "[ sec : init ] are robust against the initial segregation .",
    "kml showed that the global evolution ( such as @xmath12 & @xmath35 ) of clusters initially having king profiles of @xmath1167 does not depend on @xmath115 values .",
    "this is because king profiles with different @xmath115 values mainly differ at the core while the global evolution of the cluster is mostly determined by the properties in the cluster envelope . here",
    "we make two n - body simulations initially having plummer models to see the effects of initial conditions different from king models .",
    "plummer models have a density profile of @xmath117 which has no density drop analogous to tidal cutoff in king models ( @xmath118 is the core radius ) .",
    "thus the density profiles of plummer models have shallower decrease than king models near @xmath35 , and have to be artificially cut at @xmath35 . the only parameter that determines the profile is the ratio of @xmath35 to @xmath118 , @xmath119 . here",
    "we perform two simulations analogous to model 13 with @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "the plummer model with @xmath122 has core density and half - mass radius comparable to those of the king model with @xmath123 .",
    "we find that the plummer models give @xmath17 values only slightly longer than that of the corresponding king model ( by less than 20  % ) , and @xmath75 and the number counts of the plummer models are very similar to those of the king model .",
    "therefore , the findings in ",
    "[ sec : init ] may also apply to models with plummer initial conditions with @xmath1206 .",
    "using aarseth s nbody6 codes , we have studied the dynamical evolution of cycs near the gc .",
    "first , we confirm the results of kml that clusters with a mass @xmath0 evaporate in @xmath1  myr , but find that the f - p calculations by kml underestimated the lifetimes of cycs by 5 to 30  % in most cases .",
    "this discrepancy is due to the adoption by kml of values of @xmath46 which are too small , and we find that @xmath46 of 250300 would be appropriate although such a large number would bring the effctive mass of the largest mass bin down to a value at which we would lose some of the effects associated with the presence of the most massive stars . without stellar evolution , the above @xmath17 discrepancy would be more considerable , i.e. the mass loss from stellar evolution starting slightly after @xmath55  myr significantly accelerates the evaporation of the clusters .",
    "the volume density profiles from f - p calculations are steeper than those from n - body simulations , and especially , the f - p densities outside @xmath35 are significantly underestimated .    by comparing the surface number density profiles and number counts in 2 mass bins at 2 radius bins between n - body simulations and _ hst_/nicmos photometry of the arches cluster",
    ", we find the following best - fit initial conditions : @xmath124 and @xmath45 .",
    "the relation between @xmath12 and @xmath40 is constrained by the observed number of stars heavier than @xmath72 , 150 .",
    "larger or smaller @xmath40 values than 1.75 give less satisfactory number count fits to observations .",
    "the presence of primordial binaries favors slightly smaller @xmath40 values than 1.75 .",
    "the fit of @xmath75 to observations indicates @xmath125  pc , but @xmath13 is not well constrained . the mean density of the bulge inside the arches cluster is suggested to be 5@xmath126 . also , we confirm the finding of kml that for clusters with @xmath89 , @xmath17 of a cluster with @xmath127 is very close to that of a cluster with @xmath128",
    ". however , the number count plots seem to more support @xmath94 .",
    "these findings are in agreement with the arguments by morris ( 1993 ) that the non - standard star formation environment near the gc may lead to an imf skewed toward relatively massive stars and having an elevated lower mass cutoff .",
    "the global evolution and @xmath17 of cycs are nearly independent of the initial mass segregation and the choice of initial density profile",
    ". clusters with initial mass segregation and reverse segregation ( more heavy stars in the outer region ) show very similar evolution except in the very early phase ( @xmath129  myr ) .",
    "plummer initial models with @xmath130 and 6 exhibit indistinguishable evolution from a king initial model .",
    "therefore , our findings regarding the initial conditions of the arches cluster appear to be insensitive to the initial mass distribution .",
    "as discussed in kml , the effect of the gas left over from cluster formation may be important to the early dynamical evolution of cycs because the remnant gas is thought to be blown away from the cluster in the early phases by strong stellar winds or supernova explosions , and such abrupt disappearance may significantly change the potential of the cluster in a short amount of time .",
    "consequently , the role of the remnant gas in early cluster evolution will be the subject of a future study using n - body simulations .",
