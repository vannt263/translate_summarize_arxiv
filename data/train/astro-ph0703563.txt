    "precision cosmology relies on the capability of accurately extracting cosmological parameters from measurements of observables related to cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropy and polarization as well as to the large - scale structure ( lss ) of the universe . in the cmb context , the tool allowing a comparison of data and theory , at the percent level , is perturbation theory ( pt ) .",

    "bao s have recently been detected both in the 2df and sdss surveys data @xcite , and are going to be measured in the near future in a series of high - redshift surveys @xcite .    due to the higher degree of non - linearity of the underlying density fluctuations compared to those relevant for the cmb , accurate computations of thepower - spectrumin the bao region is challenging , and",
    "has so far been best afforded by means of high - resolution @xmath0-body simulations ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "in particular , the study of bao to constrain dark energy models requires a precision of a few percent in the theoretical predictions for the matterpower - spectrumin the relevant wavenumber range @xcite . including higher orders in pt @xcite",
    "is known to give a poor performance in this range , while all available fitting functions for the non - linearpower - spectrum(e.g . refs .",
    "@xcite ) are uncapable to reach the required level of accuracy @xcite , leaving n - body simulations as the only viable approach to the problem .",
    "recently , however , pt has experienced a renewed interest , mainly motivated by two reasons .",
    "first , next generation galaxy surveys @xcite are going to measure thepower - spectrumat large redshift , where the fluctuations are still in the linear regime and 1-loop pt is expected to work @xcite .",
    "second , crocce and scoccimarro @xcite have shown that the perturbative expansion can be reorganized in a very convenient way , which allows the use of standard tools of field theory , like feynman diagrams .",
    "they managed to compute the two - point correlator between density or velocity field fluctuations at different times ( the ` propagator ' ) by resumming an infinite class of diagrams at all orders in pt .",
    "other approaches can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will present a new approach to the problem , based on renormalization group ( rg ) techniques developed in quantum field theory and statistical physics @xcite .",
    "we will give the full details of the formulation of the method and of its application to the computation of the power - spectrum in the bao region , whose results have been recently presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "rg methods are particularly suited to physical situations in which there is a separation between the scale where one is supposed to control the ` fundamental ' theory and the scale were measurements are actually made .",
    "starting from the fundamental scale , the rg flow describes the gradual inclusion of fluctuations at scales closer and closer to the one relevant to measurements .",
    "the new fluctuations which are included at an intermediate step , feel an effective theory , which has been ` dressed ' by the fluctuations already included . in the present case ,",
    "the rg flow will start from small wavenumbers @xmath2 , where linear theory works , to reach higher and higher @xmath2 .",
    "one of the most important results of our analysis is that an intrinsic ultra - violet ( uv ) cutoff emerges from the rg flow , which suggest that the non - linear gravitational evolution itself implies a small - scale smoothing , so that our description can work also on fairly non - linear scales .",
    "the main result of this paper is the evaluation of the non - linear matter power - spectrum in a standard @xmath3cdm model , including a very accurate fit of the bao features obtained in @xmath0-body simulations , down to zero redhift and to length - scales where any previous analytical or semi - analytical techniques have failed .",
    "moreover , our approach allows a straightforward extension to more general cosmologies with dynamical dark energy .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the equations that govern the dynamics of self - gravitating dark matter in the fluid limit and , following ref .",
    "@xcite , we recast them in the compact form of a single non - linear equation , for a suitable field doublet in fourier space . in section 3",
    "we obtain the generating functional of n - point correlation functions for our system in the form of a path - integral which incorporates the statistics of initial conditions ( here assumed to be gaussian , for simplicity ) .",
    "the general formulation of the rg equations is given in section 4 .",
    "in sects . 5 and 6 we derive the equations and present our solutions for the non - linear propagator and ps , respectively .",
    "conclusions and future prospects are discussed in sect .",
    "the distribution of a gas of dm particles of mass @xmath4 is described by the function @xmath5 , where @xmath6 represents the comoving spatial coordinate , @xmath7 is given by @xmath8 ( @xmath9 being the scale factor ) and @xmath10 is the conformal time .",
    "the evolution of @xmath11 is governed by the collisionless boltzmann equation , a.k.a .",
    "the vlasov equation , + f - a m _ * p * f=0.@xmath12 is the gravitational potential which , on subhorizon scales , obeys the poisson equation , ^2 = h^2 , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 the mass - density fluctuation , d^3*p * f(*x * , * p * , ) ( * x * , ) ( ) [ 1+(*x * , ) ] , [ mom0 ] having assumed an einstein - de sitter background cosmology .    a full solution of the non - linear and non - local vlasov equation is a formidable task .",
    "a more affordable strategy is to take _ moments _ of the distribution functions .",
    "along with the zeroth order one , defined in eq .",
    "( [ mom0 ] ) , one can define the infinite tower of higher order moments , & & d^3*p * f(*x * , * p * , ) ( * x * , ) v_i(*x * , ) + & & d^3*p * f(*x * , * p * , ) ( * x * , ) v_i(*x * , ) v_j ( * x * , ) + _ ij(*x * , ) + & &  .    the definitions above , once inserted in the vlasov equation , give rise to an infinite hierarchy of equations involving moments of higher and higher order @xcite .",
    "the system can be truncated by setting to zero the stress tensor @xmath15 .",
    "although the latter term would arise as soon as orbit - crossing appears in the non - linear evolution of our collisionless system , this procedure , dubbed ` single stream approximation ' , is formally self - consistent , since no non - vanishing @xmath15 is generated by the above set of moment equations once it is set to zero in the initial conditions .",
    "moreover , as we will see in the following , an intrinsic uv cutoff emerges from the rg flow .    in this case , one is left with just two equations & & + * * = 0 , + & & + h * v * + ( * v * ) * v*= - * * , [ euler ] which are the continuity and euler equations , respectively .    defining , as usual , the velocity divergence @xmath16 , and going to fourier space , eqs .",

    "moreover , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the slight deviation of @xmath42 from unity would only affect the decaying mode , thus making the above approximation extremely accurate .",
    "the aim of this section is to apply methods familiar in quantum field theory to construct generating functionals for quantities like the power - spectrum , bispectrum , propagator and any other object of interest .",
