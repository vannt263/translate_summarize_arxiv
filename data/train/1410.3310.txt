    "the recent increase in the number of @xmath0-ray pulsar detections , largely due to the _ fermi _ satellite , allows great progress to be made in our understanding of these sources .",
    "a key question is that of the location and structure of the emission region .",
    "an important element required to test various models of this against observations is the determination of the `` viewing geometry '' , which describes how an observer s line of sight samples a given pulsar s magnetosphere .",
    "knowledge of this for a particular pulsar allows predictions to be made corresponding to a given model of the @xmath0-ray beam pattern , which can then be compared to observations in order to examine the model s veracity .",
    "based on radio polarisation data , viewing geometry constraints were presented by @xcite ( henceforth rwj14 ) for 28 pulsars which were included in the 2nd _ fermi _ large area telescope catalogue of @xmath0-ray pulsars @xcite . to this end , data taken predominantly at 1369  mhz using the parkes radio telescope as part of the _ fermi _ timing project @xcite were obtained . the aim of this timing project is to make regular monthly radio observations of a set of pulsars with a high energy loss rate @xmath2 to construct timing models allowing to tag rotational phases to photons detected by the _ fermi _ satellite . in rwj14",
    "these data were used to construct polarisation - calibrated averaged pulse profiles of the total , linearly polarised and circularly polarised intensity , along with profiles of the position angle ( pa ) of the linearly polarised component of the observed emission .",
    "the viewing geometry is characterised by two angles , the magnetic inclination @xmath1 ( the angle between the rotation and magnetic axes ) and the impact parameter @xmath3 ( the angle between the line of sight and the magnetic axis at the closest approach ) .",
    "these parameters can be constrained by analysing the polarised radio emission and the pulse profile of the pulsar .",
    "distribution of most likely @xmath1 values , as quoted in table 2 of rwj14 and shown in fig .",
    "29 of the same paper .",
    "the dashed curve is the sinusoidal distribution expected for a randomly orientated rotation axis and line of sight in the absence of any observational biases .",
    "it can clearly be seen that the distributions are different . ]",
    "[ figoriginaldistribution ] shows the distribution of @xmath1 values presented in table 2 of rwj14 . for this figure and subsequent analysis @xmath1",
    "was mapped between 0 and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 if @xmath6 ) as there is no physical difference between these two regimes . for three out of 28 sources the viewing geometry could not be reliably determined due to extreme uncertainties on the relevant parameters , as discussed in @xmath7  4 of rwj14 .",
    "this distribution shows a significant tendency towards low values such that 60% of the sample have @xmath8 , consistent with other results in the literature .",
    "@xcite discussed @xmath1 distributions using values derived by @xcite and @xcite , all of which demonstrate a peak at @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite also separated the sample according to characteristic age ( @xmath10 , which is not necessarily the true age ) and corrected the measured distributions according to the beaming fraction , the proportion of the celestial sphere covered by the emission beam , assuming an empirical relationship between @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "one of these distributions comprised pulsars younger than @xmath13 yr , which is approximately the same as the range of ages of our sample .",
    "this inferred intrinsic distribution also exhibited a tendency towards low @xmath1 values , consistent with our results .",
    "the methods used by rwj14 were different from those used by @xcite , supporting the determined shape of the observed @xmath1 distribution .",
    "this is a puzzling result , however .",
    "it is commonly assumed that the relative orientation of the magnetic and rotation axes is random at birth , in the sense that the two are placed randomly on the star",
    ". if this is the case , the intrinsic @xmath1 distribution should be sinusoidal ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as shown by the dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ figoriginaldistribution ] .",
    "two effects suggest that any deviation from the sinusoidal distribution should in fact be a bias towards high @xmath1 values , opposite to the apparent bias in this sample . the beaming fraction , which is equivalent to the probability that the beam of a given pulsar intersects an observer s line of sight , increases with @xmath1 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this means that radio observations should detect a larger proportion of the total population of orthogonal rotators than of aligned rotators .",
    "additionally , the prediction from @xmath0-ray models is that the pulsations of @xmath0-ray - loud pulsars are more easily detected when @xmath1 is large ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as the pulsars in this sample",
    "are all @xmath0-ray - detected , we would expect this selection effect to skew our observed distribution further towards higher values , by an amount which depends on the particular @xmath0-ray model .",
    "neither this nor the effect of the beaming fraction will be quantified further in this paper , but their effect on our results will be discussed .    an immediate question raised by the discrepancy between the observed distribution and our expectation is whether the @xmath1 values should be expected to follow the birth distribution .",
    "it has been suggested that the magnetic axis should align with the rotation axis over time , meaning this assumption will only be valid for a sample of sufficiently young pulsars .",
    "however , @xcite showed that for the pulsar population as a whole , if the axes are assumed to be randomly aligned at birth , the proportion of pulsars exhibiting an interpulse as a function of age is best reproduced by allowing the angle between them to decrease with a timescale @xmath14  yr .",
    "other estimates of this timescale are @xmath15 to @xmath16  yr @xcite .",
    "the highest characteristic age of any pulsar in this sample is @xmath17  yr ( psr j10575226 ) , which is significantly less than the alignment timescale .",
    "this indicates that the distribution for this sample should not have evolved significantly from the birth distribution .",
    "further to this , it has recently been suggested @xcite that the magnetic axis of the crab pulsar ( @xmath18  @xmath19  yr ) may be moving _",
    "away _ from the rotation axis .",
    "if all very young pulsars undergo such a period of increasing @xmath1 , this would strengthen the expectation that large @xmath1 values should be favoured for the sample considered here .    in this paper",
    "we discuss various observational and other biases which could potentially cause the observed tendency towards low @xmath1 values , including emission generated outside what is traditionally thought to be the open - field - line region , and find two possible explanations for the form the distribution takes .",
    "the first of these is simply that the magnetic and rotation axes are not randomly orientated at birth as expected , but instead neutron stars are more likely to be born with the axes aligned than orthogonal .",
    "alternatively , the axes _ are _ randomly orientated and one of the assumptions used in the derivation of the @xmath1 values is invalid .",
    "we argue that the most likely possibility is that the radio emission beam is larger than expected for a dipolar field by a proportion which is dependent on the magnetic inclination .",
    "in the following text we give a summary of the process for constraining the viewing geometry , as applied in rwj14 and other publications in which radio polarisation data are interpreted .",
    "this will form the mathematical basis for the discussion in this paper .",
    "information about the viewing geometry can be obtained by fitting the rotating vector model ( rvm ; @xcite ) to the observed pa curve of each pulsar .",
    "the rvm depends on @xmath1 and @xmath3 and so the resulting @xmath20 surface in ( @xmath1 , @xmath3 ) space constitutes an initial constraint on these parameters .    the viewing geometry can be constrained further by considering the effect of aberration and retardation ( a / r ; @xcite ) and the emission height ( @xmath21 , the distance of the emission region from the centre of the star ) which can subsequently be determined .",
    "this effect arises from relativistic motion of the emission region relative to the observer as the region corotates with the neutron star .",
    "the pa curve predicted by the rvm features a point of inflection which , neglecting the a / r effect , would be observed when the fiducial plane ( the plane containing the two axes ) passes the line of sight .",
    "however , the a / r effect results in a delay in pulse phase of the inflection point relative to the location of the fiducial plane inferred from the intensity profile of    @xmath22    where @xmath12 is the rotation period of the star and @xmath23 is the speed of light @xcite",
    ". the pulse phase at which the inflection point of the observed pa curve occurs follows from rvm fitting , and the location of the fiducial plane in terms of pulse phase can be judged somewhat subjectively using the profile morphology .",
    "the relative delay @xmath24 then follows and so @xmath21 can be determined .    with the emission height known , the half - opening - angle , @xmath11 , of the beam of radio emission",
    "can be found by assuming that the beam is bounded by tangents to the last - open - field lines of a dipolar magnetic field .",
    "given this assumption , @xmath21 yields the half - opening angle via    @xmath25    where @xmath26 , the angular radius of the open - field - line region , is given by @xmath27 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this beamwidth can finally be related to the range of rotational phase for which the line of sight samples the open - field - line region , @xmath28 , and the viewing geometry by    @xmath29    @xcite .",
    "the symmetry of the open - field - line region of a dipolar field means that the line of sight will sample open field lines for an equal amount of phase before and after the fiducial plane . in rwj14",
    "the fiducial plane was not necessarily chosen to correspond to the centre of the observed pulse , meaning that @xmath28 can not be assumed to be the same as the observed pulse width . instead",
    ", it was taken to be twice the difference in phase between the fiducial plane position and the pulse edge furthest from it .",
    "the implications of this decision will be discussed in @xmath7  [ sectmovingphifid ] .",
    "the pulse edges were in general taken to be the points at which the emission was 10% of the peak intensity . from the calculated values of @xmath11 and @xmath28 , eq .",
    "[ eqrhocontours ] can be used to constrain @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "the best joint solution from rvm fitting and the pulse width considerations was defined as the favoured viewing geometry .",
    "there are several possible reasons why an intrinsically sinusoidal distribution may appear skewed towards low @xmath1 values .",
    "these include    1 .   a systematic underestimation of the phase of the pa curve inflection point ; 2 .   a systematic overestimation of the phase of the fiducial plane ; 3 .   a non - circularity of the emission region , and 4 .   extra - cap emission ( in which the emission region is larger than expected for the open - field - line region of a simple dipolar magnetic field ) .    in the following subsections we consider",
    "each effect in turn and investigate whether it could sufficiently distort the @xmath1 distribution .",
    "we will argue that the most plausible solution which allows the @xmath1 distribution to be sinusoidal involves extra - cap emission for which the ratio of the beam radius to polar cap radius is @xmath1-dependent .",
    "distribution of @xmath1 values with an artificial offset of @xmath302.2@xmath31 applied to the inflection point of each pulsar .",
    "the curve is the sinusoidal distribution which we ( unsuccessfully ) tried to reproduce . ]",
    "the first effect we considered was a scenario in which the inflection point of the pa curve was systematically determined to be at an earlier pulse phase than its intrinsic location .",
    "such a bias in the positioning of the inflection point could potentially be caused by scattering , which smears out the pa curve @xcite .",
    "another potential cause of a bias could be noise , which will be discussed later in this subsection .",
    "a systematic underestimation of the location of the inflection point would mean that the determined offset between the fiducial plane and the inflection point would be underestimated .",
    "then , from eqs .",
    "[ eqbeamhalfopeningangle ] and [ eqthetapc ] , the emission height and as a consequence the predicted beamwidth would be underestimated , leading to an underestimation of @xmath1 ( eq .  [ eqrhocontours ] ) .    to investigate the effect on the @xmath1 distribution the inflection point of each of the 25 pulsars which contributed to the measured @xmath1 distribution",
    "was offset to later phase by a set number of degrees .",
    "the fiducial plane and pulse edges were kept the same .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test , which is independent of binning , was used to quantify the difference between the resulting @xmath1 distribution and the sinusoidal distribution .",
    "a lower test result indicates a greater likelihood that the two sets of values are drawn from different parent distributions .",
    "[ figshiftinf+2.2 ] shows the distribution obtained when an offset of @xmath32 was applied .",
    "this was the magnitude of offset for which the distribution was found to most closely resemble a sinusoidal distribution , with a ks test result of 4.6% corresponding to a significance slightly above 2@xmath33 .",
    "such an offset is similar in magnitude to the effect of scattering observed by @xcite in the case of psr j09084913 , suggesting the offset applied in the figure could potentially be explained by the effect of scattering in our sample .",
    "it can be seen that the peak at low @xmath1 persists , accompanied by an excess of values relative to the sinusoidal distribution at @xmath34 .",
    "the distribution was qualitatively similar even when offsets were considered which were too large to be explained by the amount of scattering exhibited in the profiles .",
    "although the @xmath35  2@xmath33 significance shows that the distribution is formally consistent with a sinusoidal distribution , it is somewhat marginal given that the match is not very good even after optimising the shift , which was a free parameter .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath0-ray selection effect and radio beaming fraction biases in our sample ( see @xmath7  [ sectintroduction ] ) are such that the observed distribution should be skewed towards high-@xmath1 relative to the sinusoidal distribution .",
    "this can not be reproduced by the shift .",
    "hence we argue that , whilst scattering may play a role , it is not the main cause of the difference .",
    "the effect of s / n on the determination of the inflection point was also investigated .",
    "the inflection point is typically at later phase than the midpoint of the profile , meaning there are more significant pa values before the inflection point .",
    "as noise contributes to the measured pa this asymmetry might , in principle , result in a bias in the determined inflection point .",
    "polarised profiles were simulated according to the rvm using various combinations of s / n and offset between the inflection point and fiducial plane .",
    "white noise was added and the rvm was fitted to the resulting pa curve . in all cases the inflection point position was unaffected when averaged over a large number of simulations , indicating that noise does not cause a systematic bias .",
    "it is therefore apparent that if the intrinsic @xmath1 distribution is sinusoidal the observed distribution can not be explained by either interstellar scattering or the effects of noise on the pa swing .",
    "distribution of @xmath1 values with an artificial shift of @xmath36 applied to the location of the fiducial plane ( solid line ) and with the fiducial plane placed 12% of the observed pulse width before the pulse for each pulsar ( dotted line ) .",
    "the distributions are similar , with the former being a slightly closer match to the sinusoidal distribution ( dashed curve ) . ]",
    "another potential cause of an excess of low measured @xmath1 values is a systematic overestimation of the phase at which the fiducial plane is located in the profile . in @xmath7  4 of rwj14",
    "the consequences of misplacing the fiducial plane were considered , but for single - component pulsars only ; in this subsection we apply the same effect to the whole of the sample .",
    "it is important to consider this possibility as the fiducial plane of each pulsar was estimated subjectively , based on the profile shape .",
    "there are several possible causes of such a systematic overestimation . within the context of the core - cone model @xcite",
    ", such an effect could arise if , for example , the leading portion of the beam is less intense than the trailing portion , such that one or multiple leading components are unobserved .",
    "this could be an extremely pronounced version of the preferential illumination at later phases noted for young pulsars by @xcite and discussed in the context of cyclotron absorption by @xcite .",
    "alternatively the radio emission might not be generated in the ordered structure postulated by the core - cone model , but instead be generated in ` patches ' distributed randomly across the open - field - line region @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that a random distribution of patches does not explain the observed excess of low @xmath1 values as a systematic bias is required ( i.e. , preferential illumination of the trailing side of the beam ) .",
    "another possible reason for an overestimation of the fiducial plane position would be that the centre of the radio beam ( in either the core - cone or patchy beam model ) trails the magnetic axis ( that is , the fiducial plane is not at the centre of the range of phase described by @xmath28 ) .",
    "however , in this situation only the relative offset of the fiducial plane and inflection point would be affected ( the extent of the open - field - line region , and hence @xmath28 , would be unaffected ) , making this possibility equivalent to the inflection point offsets considered in @xmath7  [ sectmovingphi0 ] .",
    "the result of a systematic overestimation of the fiducial plane was first of all investigated by offsetting the fiducial plane determined in rwj14 by a set amount of pulse phase and determining the resulting @xmath1 distribution , using a method analogous to that described in @xmath7  [ sectintroduction ] .",
    "the distributions obtained using various offsets showed that as the offset becomes larger the increasing beamwidths cause the peak of the distribution to move towards higher @xmath1 .",
    "however , as the magnitude of the offset is increased further , the effect of the increasing inferred @xmath28 values becomes dominant and the peak of the distribution moves towards lower @xmath1 .",
    "[ figshiftfid-14 ] shows the @xmath1 distribution ( solid bars ) obtained with an offset of 14@xmath31 applied to each pulsar .",
    "the data visibly match the sinusoidal distribution well , which was confirmed by a ks test result of 52% .",
    "this implies that if for every pulsar in our sample the fiducial plane is 14@xmath31 earlier than thought based on the profile morphology , this might explain the shape of the observed @xmath1 distribution .",
    "one might navely expect an overestimation of the fiducial plane position to be related to the pulse width .",
    "a similar investigation to that detailed above was performed , in which the fiducial plane was placed before or after the start of the observed pulse by the same proportion of the pulse width .",
    "this corresponds to a scenario whereby the same proportion of the beam is illuminated for each pulsar .",
    "however , this did not result in any better match to a sinusoidal distribution .",
    "the results of the ks test peaked at 26% for a fiducial plane position 12% of the observed width before the start of the pulse , equivalent to the trailing 45% of each pulsar s beam being illuminated .",
    "this is shown by the dotted bars in fig .",
    "[ figshiftfid-14 ] .",
    "the ks test value is lower for a fractional offset of the fiducial plane than for an absolute - offset , indicating a slight ( but not significant ) preference for the latter scenario .",
    "it therefore appears that our sample could have an intrinsically sinusoidal @xmath1 distribution , provided either that the fiducial plane position is habitually @xmath37 earlier than is suggested by the shape of the profile or that slightly less than the trailing half of the open - field - line region is illuminated .",
    "an important point to note is that neither of these scenarios is able to produce distributions with substantial excesses relative to the sinusoidal distribution at @xmath34 . as a result , accounting for the expected selection effects of @xmath0-ray detectability and radio beaming fraction ( see @xmath7  [ sectintroduction ] ) would be difficult .",
    "the plausibility of a fiducial plane offset will be discussed further in @xmath7  [ sectimplicationsphifidoffset ] .",
    "@xcite proposed that , at a given frequency , the emission height of radiation could be greater further from the magnetic axis , and hence further from the centre of the profile .",
    "this means that the a / r effect will be most pronounced at the edges of the profile . it can be seen from eqs .",
    "[ eqbeamhalfopeningangle ] and [ eqthetapc ] that it is the emission height at the edge of the beam which leads to the overall half - opening angle of the beam . in rwj14 , however , the fiducial plane position was estimated according to the locations of component peaks , which are not at the edge of the beam and hence , according to @xcite , will have a lesser emission height .",
    "this will have caused an underestimation of @xmath24 and therefore a systematic bias towards late fiducial plane positions .",
    "it can be seen from fig .  4 of @xcite that for psr  b0329 + 54 ( which has a period of 0.7  s ) this effect is @xmath35  4@xmath31 .",
    "considering eq .",
    "[ eqoffset ] and noting that almost all the pulsars in our sample have periods less than 0.2  s , we could expect the underestimation of the fiducial plane to be greater for our sample .",
    "in addition , it is possible that high-@xmath2 pulsars emit over a more extended altitude range @xcite , potentially increasing this effect .",
    "the variation of the a / r effect across the profile will also move the ends of the pa curve towards later phase compared with the central region , which will distort the pa curve such that the leading half is made steeper while the trailing half is made more shallow .",
    "if not corrected for , this will cause a slight underestimation of the inflection point phase .",
    "however , as it is the ends of the pa curve at which the distortion is most pronounced , the curve will be less distorted close to the inflection point and so the observed position of the steepest gradient will change by only a small amount .",
    "the magnitude of this effect on @xmath38 varies between pulsars , but for this sample is expected to be typically @xmath35  1@xmath31 .",
    "therefore , the effect on our fiducial plane estimate will dominate over this effect and any change to the inflection point position can be neglected .",
    "an emission height gradient has the potential to make our observations consistent with a sinusoidal distribution .",
    "we can see from eq .",
    "[ eqoffset ] that the 14@xmath31 offset in the fiducial plane position suggested in @xmath7  [ sectmovingphifid ] could be caused by a 0.06@xmath39 difference in the emission height , where @xmath39 is the light cylinder radius .",
    "in other words , the points in the profiles which were used to determine the favoured position of the fiducial plane should have been emitted 6% of the light cylinder radius lower than were the edges of the pulse .    if an emission height gradient is the main cause of the observed tendency towards low @xmath1 values , then choosing the fiducial plane position based on the pulse edges should lead to an @xmath1 distribution which more closely resembles a sinusoid than fig .",
    "[ figoriginaldistribution ] . to test this",
    ", we obtained @xmath1 values by positioning the fiducial plane at the midpoint of the observed pulse .",
    "for this we excluded pulsars for which we believed a significant fraction of the beam is not illuminated .    despite its promise , the results of this test showed little change in the @xmath1 values , with marginally more pulsars decreasing in @xmath1 than increasing ( as described in @xmath7  [ sectmovingphifid ] , there are two competing effects acting on the @xmath1 values ) .",
    "this indicates that , whilst we do not rule out an emission height gradient for these pulsars , such a gradient can not explain the excess of low @xmath1 values .",
    "this means that the potential 14@xmath31 offset determined in the previous subsection would require some other physical justification .",
    "another possible cause of a systematic underestimation of @xmath1 is the assumption that the beam of emission is confined to a circular open - field - line region . to investigate the effect of other beam shapes , a model was considered in which the emission region was elongated into an ellipse . the methodology to determine @xmath1 for elliptical beams is analogous to the case of circular beams , except that the relevant half - opening angle in eq .",
    "[ eqrhocontours ] is @xmath40 , which is a function of the magnetic longitude at which the line of sight enters and exits the beam . we define the beam such that the half - opening angle described by tangents to the last open field lines , @xmath11 ( eq .

    "[ eqbeamhalfopeningangle ] , regardless of the direction in which the beam is elongated .",
    "this systematic underestimation of the beam half opening angle as derived under the assumption of a circular beam causes a systematic underestimation of @xmath1 .",

    ", the elongation was towards the rotational axis ) .",
    "in this case , the beam half opening angle was given by    @xmath41    in the second variant the major axis of the beam lay perpendicular to the fiducial plane ( i.e. , the elongation was in the direction of rotation ) and the beam half opening angle was given by    @xmath42    in both these equations @xmath11 is given by eq .",

    "it can be seen that the distribution tends towards higher @xmath1 values when the beam is elongated in the direction of rotation even though @xmath43 was lower in this case , as the line of sight will spend a longer time within the beam .",
    "however , both distributions still show marked departures from the sinusoidal distribution and the highest result returned by the ks test was @xmath46 for each variant , indicating a @xmath47 variation . also , for many of the sample the enlarged beamwidth resulted in a constraint from the a / r effect which was inconsistent with the constraint from fitting of the rvm ( in such cases @xmath1 was assumed to be @xmath4 in line with the methodology discussed in @xmath7  4 of rwj14 ) .",

    "equally interesting is the possibility that the measured @xmath1 distribution ( fig .",

    "the presence of a similar bias in the @xmath1 distributions of @xcite suggest that this could be the case , as those pulsars were not selected according to detectability in @xmath0-rays and so are a mixture of @xmath0-ray - loud and -quiet sources .",
    "@xcite presented the observed distribution of @xmath1 , the magnetic inclination , for a sample of young @xmath0-ray - loud pulsars .",

    "this distribution is not consistent with the sinusoidal distribution expected if the magnetic and rotation axes of a neutron star are randomly orientated at birth , confirming the results of several previous studies . the observed distribution is skewed towards low values , which is opposite to the skew which would be expected from considerations of the radio beaming fraction or from the prediction by @xmath0-ray models that pulsars are more easily detected in @xmath0-rays when @xmath1 is large .",

    "although there must by definition be an @xmath1-dependent @xmath48 distribution which will relate any desired @xmath1 distribution to the observed distribution , the fact that our result is a simple linear relation is non - trivial .",
    "it is also non - trivial that the size of the emission region tends towards that expected for a dipolar field for orthogonal rotators .",
    "two alternative effects were considered which could bias the @xmath1 distribution : that the fiducial plane position is systematically @xmath37 earlier in rotational phase than our expectations based on the profile morphology , and that only the trailing 45% of the beam is illuminated .",
    "these were both found to be mathematically possible but it has been argued to be implausible that either is the sole cause .",
    "we do not rule out the possibilities of elliptical beams or an emission height gradient , but find that these are not sufficient to explain the departure of the observed @xmath1 distribution from a sinusoidal distribution .",
    "both an intrinsically non - sinusoidal birth @xmath1 distribution and a discrepancy between the intrinsic and measured distributions have important implications for population studies .",
    "if the @xmath1 distribution is intrinsically non - sinusoidal the population - averaged beaming fraction will be lower . in the case of an @xmath1-dependent @xmath48 value",
    "the beaming fraction of each pulsar will be affected differently , but the population - averaged value will be made higher .",
    "there are also implications for the timescale for possible alignment of the two axes as a neutron star ages .",
    "both scenarios suggest this timescale to be longer than some previous estimates .",
    "each scenario raises important questions about neutron star physics .",
    "an @xmath1-dependence of @xmath48 suggests complexities in the radio emission process or magnetic field structure .",
    "an intrinsically non - sinusoidal birth @xmath1 distribution has implications for the formation of the neutron star or for the dependence of the @xmath0-ray emission process on magnetic inclination making _ aligned _ rotators easier to detect .",
    "finally we note that an @xmath1-dependent @xmath48 would make the radio models more compatible with the preferred @xmath0-ray models , which place the extended emission regions far above the polar cap .",
    "this is because extra - cap emission will increase both the radio - derived @xmath1 and @xmath3 values .",
    "larger @xmath1 values are favoured by the @xmath0-ray models , while the possibility of larger @xmath3 values will increase the allowed parameter range available for the @xmath0-ray models to fit the observed light curves .",
    "extra - cap emission therefore should be seriously considered in radio beam models .",
    "we wish to thank the referee aris karastergiou for his constructive input ."
