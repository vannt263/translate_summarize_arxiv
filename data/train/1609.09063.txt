    "<S> states with even @xmath44 are spin - singlet pairings , while those with odd @xmath44 are spin - triplet states , where `` spin '' corresponds to layer in the present model . </S>",
    "<S> the spin component of spin - singlet states is dictated by @xmath149 , which corresponds to interlayer singlet pairing in bilayer systems . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , spin - triplet states still have spin degrees of freedom , but since we focus on interlayer pairings , their spin components are described by @xmath150 , where a corresponding @xmath6-vector is @xmath151 .    </S>",
