    "recently , the central exclusive production of @xmath3 charmonia has attracted a lot of attention from both experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite sides . at the moment , such a process provides the unique opportunity to test the qcd diffractive kaidalov - khoze - martin - ryskin ( kkmr ) mechanism @xcite based on the @xmath2-factorisation incorporating nonperturbative small-@xmath6 gluon dynamics described by the unintegrated gluon distribution functions ( ugdfs ) against accessible data .",
    "the final hadronic central system is , however , rather complicated and composed of three spin states @xmath7 , and there is no yet any reliable way to measure them separately .",
    "such a measurement would significantly reduce an overall theoretical uncertainty , as different @xmath3 spin contributions come from different phase space regions @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the asymptotical forward limit @xmath5 are strongly suppressed with respect to @xmath8 due to the @xmath9 selections rule @xcite .",
    "however , corrections to this asymptotics turn out to be important in the total cross section leading to a noticeable contribution of the @xmath5 states to the observable signal from radiative @xmath3 decays @xcite .",
    "generally , separate measurements of @xmath3 states in diffractive production would impose more strict bounds on the production mechanism under consideration and extract some new information on the underlying qcd dynamics @xcite .",
    "one of the ways is to measure the characteristic differential distributions like meson @xmath10 distributions or angular correlations of the outgoing protons .",
    "however , such distributions are rather sensitive to ugdfs and cuts on kinematical variables @xcite , and existing experimental techniques do not allow to reconstruct such observables with sufficient precision .",
    "another possible way is to look at observables related with meson polarisations and their decay distributions .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to analyze polarisation effects in the central exclusive production of @xmath3 charmonia .",
    "such effects can be potentially identified by measuring the angular distribution of @xmath4 mesons from radiative decays of @xmath11 giving more detailed information on the partial meson helicity contributions . moreover",
    ", certain combinations of polarisation observables can be less sensitive to unknown nonperturbative effects leading to unique opportunities for model - independent analysis of diffractive processes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we give general expressions for the amplitude of the central exclusive @xmath5 production with all necessary notations .",
    "section iii contains discussion of the rapidity dependence of the hard subprocess amplitudes for different @xmath3 polarisations . in sections",
    "iv and v we derive the angular dependence of outgoing @xmath4 mesons in the helicity frame in terms of the diffractive @xmath3 production density matrix @xmath12 . sections vi and vii are devoted to discussion of gluon off - shell effects and absorptive corrections .",
    "section viii contains the presentation of the main results , including differential distributions of polarised @xmath5 and angular correlations of the outgoing @xmath4 mesons . finally , in section ix we give a set of concluding remarks and present a discussion of the final results and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "according to the kaidalov - khoze - martin - ryskin approach ( kkmr ) @xcite , we write the amplitude of the exclusive double diffractive color singlet production @xmath13 as @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the off - diagonal unintegrated gluon distributions for `` active '' gluons with momenta @xmath16 and color indices @xmath17 , and the screening soft gluon with small fraction @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the spin and helicity of a produced meson with momentum @xmath21 and mass @xmath22 in the center - of - mass frame of colliding protons and @xmath23 axis directed along the meson momentum @xmath24 , respectively .",

( [ v - fin - chic1 ] ) ) the `` small '' terms @xmath155",

    "such an approximation @xmath153 increases the total @xmath0 cep cross section by almost a factor of 7 in absolute normalization making a large effect in the @xmath156 ratio in the observable radiative decay channel @xcite ( see also table [ table : dy0 ] below ) .",

    ". however , such results are still within an overall theoretical uncertainty from the soft physics involved , ugdf models in the qcd mechanism under consideration @xcite , and also from unknown nlo corrections to the @xmath158 vertex , which are implicitly , but only partly , taken into account by the @xmath2-factorisation approach used .",
