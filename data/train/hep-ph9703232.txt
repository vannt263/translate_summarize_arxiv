    "slow - roll inflation @xcite requires an unusually flat scalar potential .",
    "this is quantified by the conditions @xmath3 and @xmath4 where @xmath5 .",
    "the first condition is generally not difficult to achieve ; one simply needs to be sufficiently near an extremum of the potential with positive potential energy . in many cases ` sufficiently ' just means @xmath6 from the extremum , which is almost difficult to avoid",
    "!    however , the second condition presents the most , perhaps only , serious obstacle to building a model of inflation @xcite .",
    "this is because the positive potential energy required for inflation spontaneously breaks supersymmetry , generically inducing @xmath7 for all scalar fields @xcite , and in particular for the inflaton @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 holds when the field has no supersymmetric mass and the supersymmetry breaking is only communicated via gravitational strength interactions .",
    "many models of inflation are built ignoring gravitational strength interactions , and so are implicitly setting @xmath9 .",
    "clearly one can not achieve eq .",
    "( [ src2 ] ) in this context .",
    "models of inflation built in the context of supergravity have traditionally resolved this problem by fine tuning , either explicit or implicit .",
    "only recently have there been any plausible proposals for solving this problem .",
    "the first by assuming an approximate global @xmath10 symmetry , but does _ not _ naturally satisfy eq .",
    "( [ src2 ] ) because @xmath11 vanishes in the limit where the symmetry is exact .",
    "a hybrid natural inflation model might avoid this problem though , as was noted in ref .",
    "@xcite . ] was given in refs .",
    "it employed forms for the kahler potential that had been derived from weakly coupled heterotic string theory , in combination with a subset of the modular symmetries , to cancel the supergravity corrections .",
    "this method should also work in appropriate limits of m - theory .",
    "it requires an inflationary energy density well above the vacuum supersymmetry breaking scale , @xmath12 ; @xmath13 to @xmath2gev in our vacuum for gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking .",
    "a natural implementation of this method would be to have the non - perturbative physics that leads to gaugino condensation at a scale @xmath14gev in our vacuum generate the inflationary potential at a similar energy scale @xmath15",
    ". it should be possible to stabilise the moduli during inflation by the same method that stabilises them in our vacuum , though the transition from inflation to vacuum could be dangerous if the end of inflation is not sufficiently smooth .",
    "a simple model of inflation with the appropriate energy scale and a smooth end to inflation was given in ref .",
    "this method has the practical disadvantage that it requires detailed control of the effective supergravity theory , but otherwise remains very promising .",
    "it was also noted in ref .",
    "@xcite that the supergravity corrections could be avoided if the inflationary potential energy was dominated by the @xmath16-term , and a hybrid inflation @xcite implementation of that idea was constructed with a fayet - iliopoulos term dominating the energy density .",
    "the main problem with this method is to obtain a fayet - iliopoulos term at a low enough energy scale to obtain the cobe normalisation for the density perturbations , but at a scale higher than the @xmath17-term supersymmetry breaking to avoid the @xmath17-term supersymmetry breaking inducing too large a mass for the inflaton .",
    "the stabilisation of the moduli , the dilaton in the case of the heterotic string , may also be a serious problem .",
    "a fayet - iliopoulos term does arise in many compactifications of the heterotic string @xcite , but its scale , typically @xmath18 to @xmath19gev , a conservative lower bound being @xmath20gev , is at the limit of being too high for any type of inflation to meet the cobe constraint @xcite , and in particular is always too high if the slope of the inflaton s potential is dominated by the loop correction as in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which case the cobe normalisation requires @xmath21gev .",
    "however , in m - theory scales are more flexible @xcite , and so it may be possible to obtain a fayet - iliopoulos term at a sufficiently low scale .",
    "there still remains the problem of stabilising the moduli .",
    "one possibility would be if either the gauge coupling , or the fayet - iliopoulos term itself , had a large non - perturbative dependence on the moduli . whether this can be achieved at the same time as having a sufficiently low energy scale for the fayet - iliopoulos term remains to be seen .",
    "another possibility would be to generate the fayet - iliopoulos term by field theory methods at a lower energy scale , but as this probably requires @xmath17-term supersymmetry breaking it may be difficult to avoid the inflaton getting too large a mass from this source . especially in this latter case , one might also have to consider the inflaton dependence of the gauge coupling and fayet - iliopoulos term , which could provide an effective mass for the inflaton .",
    "the method of @xcite uses a global heisenberg symmetry , which has been derived from string theory at tree and one loop level , to cancel the supergravity corrections .",
    "the stabilisation of the modulus that forms an integral part of the mechanism is a serious problem for this method .",
    "this is the only method that could conceivably implement the naively popular @xmath22 chaotic inflation models .",
    "the method of @xcite is somewhat complex and requires specific couplings of a goldstone boson to the inflaton , but is an interesting possibility .    in this paper",
    "i will use the method of ref .",
    "it has the advantages that it does not require any special features of the high energy theory , and can be implemented at the scale @xmath1 to @xmath2gev where the moduli are already stabilised .",
    "i will rely heavily on ref .",
    "the reader would benefit from reading it first . from now on i set @xmath23 .",
    "the potential of the model ( see figure  [ potfig ] ) is @xcite @xmath24\\ ] ] with @xmath25 , the minimum value expected in a generic supergravity theory , and @xmath26 .",
    "the function @xmath27 is determined by the renormalisation group running of the mass of the inflaton @xmath28 .",
    "the potential is assumed to have a maximum at @xmath29 , with @xmath30 .",
    "we then have @xmath31 , allowing slow roll inflation near @xmath32 @xcite",
    ". we are free to choose @xmath33 , so that @xmath34 .    the most natural scale for the potential",
    "is @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the supersymmetry breaking scale in our vacuum .",
    "i will take @xmath37 corresponding to gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking . in this case",
    "the cobe normalisation gives @xmath38 and so @xmath39 @xcite . in section  [ renorm ] , @xmath40 will be derived from a gauge coupling of strength similar to that of the gut gauge coupling inferred from the lep data , @xmath41 .",
    "it is worth noting that the fact that @xmath36 is so small is crucial to our being able to achieve slow roll inflation without fine tuning .",
    "in this section i will give a rough derivation of the function @xmath42 .",
    "the inflaton @xmath28 gives masses proportional to its expectation value to the fields to which it couples , and so @xmath28 acts like an infra - red cutoff to the renormalisation .",
    "i will assume that @xmath28 is charged under some asymptotically free gauge group and for simplicity neglect the yukawa couplings .",
    "defining @xmath43 so that @xmath44 , the renormalisation group equation @xcite for @xmath28 s mass becomes @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the quadratic casimir invariant of @xmath28 s representation under the gauge group .",

    "@xcite , i said that the above model with the slow roll inflation occuring as @xmath28 rolls from the maximum at @xmath29 towards the false vacuum at @xmath69 , had problematic initial conditions .",
    "here , i argue to the contrary that this model has very natural initial conditions if we choose the vacuum at @xmath70 to be another false vacuum . then the inflaton @xmath28 will be easily trapped in the large false vacuum potential well at @xmath70 , giving rise to eternal @xcite old inflation .",
    "there will be an extremely small , but _",
    "finite _ , chance that quantum fluctuations will kick @xmath28 to the top of the barrier at @xmath29 , where once again eternal inflation occurs .",
    "the chance that this will happen is extremely small , but , because it is finite , it will be more than compensated for by the two lots of eternal inflation .",
    "thus the initial conditions for the slow roll inflation , @xmath29 , are naturally obtained .",
    "as we are focussing on the case where the slow roll inflation occurs as @xmath28 rolls off the maximum at @xmath29 towards the false vacuum at @xmath69 , it will be convenient to define @xmath71 so that @xmath72 and @xmath73 during the slow roll inflation , and @xmath74 so that @xmath75 , @xmath76 during the slow roll inflation , and @xmath77 .",

    "i will neglect the small number of @xmath89-folds of inflation during this fast rolling stage . during slow roll , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , and so @xcite @xmath92",
    "to end inflation , one must use a hybrid inflation type mechanism @xcite to exit from the false vacuum at some critical value @xmath93 .    a standard hybrid inflation exit from the false vacuum @xcite , with the new field @xmath94 also having a mass squared @xmath95 @xcite , and with a coupling @xmath96 between the fields , @xmath97 v_0 \\phi^2 - \\frac{1}{2 } m_\\psi^2 \\psi^2 + \\frac{1}{2 } \\lambda^2 \\phi^2 \\psi^2 + \\ldots\\ ] ] would give @xmath98 , or @xmath99 .",
    "typically , @xmath100 , in which case @xmath28 will be fast rolling at @xmath101 making the precise value of @xmath102 not very important .",
    "such a hybrid inflation exit from the false vacuum may lead to a large spike in the spectrum @xcite , which could be dangerous . in our model ,",
    "contrary to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , the inflaton is typically fast rolling at @xmath101 which may make the spike less dangerous @xcite .",
    "if dangerous , such a spike could be avoided by a mutated hybrid inflation type exit from the false vacuum @xcite .",
    "for example , one could naturally have an additional term @xmath103 in the potential which would avoid the spike but leave @xmath104 essentially unchanged .",
    "as the gauge coupling is getting stronger as @xmath28 is decreasing , it is also conceivable that the exit from the false vacuum might be controlled by strong coupling effects .",

    "it will last for @xmath107 @xmath89-folds .    for @xmath108 , and assuming that thermal inflation @xcite occurs after this inflation",
    ", observable scales would leave the horizon between 20 and 30 @xmath89-folds before the end of this inflation @xcite .",
    "if reheating was rapid and there was no thermal inflation , this would be increased to between 40 and 50 @xmath89-folds at maximum . for @xmath109 , eq .",
    "( [ npsi ] ) gives @xmath110 , so that even in the latter case observable scales would leave the horizon during this non - slow roll stage of inflation leading to an unacceptable spectral index . to get observable scales safely leaving the horizon during the slow roll inflation , say at least between 10 and 20 @xmath89-folds before @xmath28 reached @xmath101 ,",
    "would require @xmath111 and so @xmath112 in the case with thermal inflation , and @xmath113 and so @xmath114 in the case without .",

    "i have been assuming that @xmath123 , as will usually be the case .",
    "if @xmath124 , inflation may end slightly earlier so that one should take a slightly larger value of @xmath125 .",
    "a more accurate but implicit formula is given by using @xcite @xmath126 and eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) instead of eq .",
    "( [ tsr ] ) . some example spectra and spectral indices",
    "are plotted in figures  [ specfig ] and  [ indfig ] respectively .",
    "in a previous paper @xcite i described how to construct a potential flat enough for slow roll inflation without fine tuning and without making any assumptions about the high energy theory . in this paper",
    "i have emphasised an implementation of that idea which can naturally produce an observationally viable spectral index even for @xmath1 to @xmath2gev .",
    "although any observationally viable spectral index can be obtained , the model does predict a distinctive shape to the spectrum , given to lowest order in the slow roll approximation by @xmath127 or in terms of the spectral index @xmath128 which may allow it to be distinguished from other models of inflation by sufficiently precise observations . the extra power on small scales , for a given tilt on larger scales , may be helpful for mixed dark matter scenarios of structure formation .",
    "finally , i will compare the model with that of randall , soljacic and guth ( rsg ) @xcite .",
    "the models share some of the same motivations and features , such as to use the flat directions characteristic of supersymmetric and string theories , lifted by supersymmetry breaking at a scale @xmath13 to @xmath2gev , to drive inflation .",
    "both also use a hybrid inflation type mechanism to exit from the false vacuum .",
    "however , they also have important differences :    1 .",
    "rsg fine tune the inflaton s mass while our model uses the method of ref .",
    "@xcite , the renormalisation of the inflaton s mass that would be present anyway , to obtain a mass small enough for slow roll inflation without fine tuning .",
    "2 .   the numbers tend to work out better here , the coupling @xmath129 involved in the hybrid inflation mechanism does not need to be small ; our small parameter @xmath40 is derived from a gauge coupling of the order of the gut gauge coupling inferred from the lep data .",
    "the only parameter we may have to tune slightly is the mass of the other field involved in the hybrid inflation mechanism , but even this was to a lesser extent than in rsg .",
    "the possible spike in the spectrum produced by the hybrid inflation mechanism is probably less dangerous here because the inflaton will typically be fast rolling at this point .",
    "the spectral index in rsg is @xmath130 , while our model can give @xmath131 which may be preferred by observations .",
    "the spectrum has a significant bend .",
