    "for instance we proved the transversality theorem in the singular case and two types of @xmath10 structure preserving theorems ( @xcite ) , and we introduced the notion of directional homeomorphism , proving a unified @xmath10 structure preserving theorem with directional homeomorphisms ( @xcite ) .    in this note , using sampoio s idea , we generalise his main result in @xcite and the aforementioned main result in @xcite to the case of the @xmath10 setting .",
    "although the proofs are in the spirit of @xcite , basically the same as in @xcite ( at times even simpler ) , due to the wide potential applications , we believe that it is still worth mentioning this generalisation .",
    "we describe both the notions and notations necessary for this topic and our results in the @xmath10 setting and some numerical properties of @xmath10 in  2 . in  3 we describe the main results in this note and give their proofs .",
