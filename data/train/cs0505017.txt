    "we will next show that this is tight .",
    "we will reduce the problem of uniqueness of numbers to the problem of finding the delaunay depth .",
    "it is known that the problem of deciding if , given @xmath7 real numbers , all of them are distinct , has complexity @xmath10 when the model of computation is the algebraic decision tree @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we will see that if certain computations are made in @xmath39 and then the delaunay depth of an adequate point is found , we can decide the uniqueness of @xmath7 given real numbers .",
    "this implies that the computation of the delaunay depth requires @xmath141 time .     and its delaunay layers .",
    "]    let us consider a set @xmath142 of real numbers ; without loss of generality we can assume that they are all positive . for each value @xmath143 , we construct the points @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "we denote by @xmath2 the union of these points and let @xmath146 be the origin .",
    "the delaunay triangulation @xmath140 is as shown in figure [ uniqueness ] , from which we have omitted the diagonals of the trapezium ( any of the two diagonals in a trapezium gives a delaunay triangulation and the depths of the points remain unaltered by the choice ) .",
    "the presence of the edges of slopes @xmath147 is immediate : for example , @xmath148 is adjacent to @xmath149 since the circle of center @xmath150 and radius @xmath151 covers only these two points of @xmath3 .",
    "evidently , the depth of @xmath1 in @xmath3 equals @xmath152 if , and only if , all the elements of @xmath153 are distinct .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "it has thus been established the following result :    the depth of a point @xmath1 with respect to a data set @xmath8 can be found in @xmath4 time , and this value is optimal .",
    "if we admit an additional preprocess to the given point set , we have different alternatives for computing the level of a new point .",
    "for example the preprocessing might consist of computing the delaunay triangulation , or even the arrangement of the delaunay circles ; nevertheless the most natural approach is to compute the delaunay levels in a first step , which requires @xmath0 time ; as this gives a plane subdivision of size @xmath39 , standard point - location methods can then be used . in particular ,",
    "the approach in @xcite can be easily adapted and allows @xmath154 query time .",
    "it is also natural to consider how strong the change in the delaunay depths of a point set can be after the insertion of a new point .",
    "this is the issue we study next .",
    "let @xmath2 be a set of @xmath7 points of depth equal to @xmath85 .",
    "the insertion of one point in @xmath2 can change the depth of another point in at most @xmath155 units and the depth of the set can vary by @xmath156 .",
    "these bounds are tight .",
    "one point can vary its depth when its set of neighbors varies ( for instance when @xmath1 is a new neighbor ) or some of its neighbors changes its depth .",
    "the insertion of one point in @xmath2 can produce at most a change of depth equal to @xmath157 units , if and only if some of the deepest points is a neighbor of the least deep one .",
    "let us see now an example of a point set @xmath2 with depth @xmath158 , in which the insertion of a suitable point modifies the depth of a certain point from @xmath159 to @xmath78 .",
    "let us consider two triangles homothetic from their common circumcenter such that the circumcircle @xmath103 of the inner triangle @xmath160crosses twice each edge of the outer triangle @xmath161(see figure [ fig6.24 ] ) .",
    "then @xmath2 is defined by taking the six vertices of the triangles and placing evenly points in the segments @xmath162 @xmath163 and @xmath164 ) that join corresponding vertices of both triangles .",
    "notice that the interior of the disk bounded by @xmath103 is empty of points of @xmath2 and that part of it is outside @xmath11 .",
    "the delaunay layers of @xmath2 are triangles and the depth of @xmath2 is @xmath158 ; layers and levels are shown in figure [ fig.localiz ] ( top ) .",
    "lie on the segments @xmath165 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 . ]",
    "we insert now a point @xmath1 ( refer to figure [ fig.localiz ] ) which is exterior to @xmath11 and interior to the disk bounded by @xmath103 . in this way , @xmath1 is adjacent to the three vertices of @xmath160 and to all points placed on the two closest segments @xmath166 , let them be , for example , @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "hence @xmath1 is adjacent to points of depth @xmath158 in @xmath2 ( the vertices of @xmath160 ) and to points of depth @xmath50 ( the vertices of @xmath161 ) .",
    "let us compute the depths in the @xmath3 .",
    "the point @xmath1 has depth @xmath50 ( it is exterior to @xmath11 ) and any of its neighbors that is not in that hull has now depth @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , at least one point of depth equal to @xmath158 in @xmath2 , has depth @xmath78 in @xmath167 , a change as claimed .",
    "the points of depth @xmath50 and @xmath78 in @xmath2 have still the same depth in @xmath168 .",
    "the edges of @xmath140 with an endpoint in @xmath164 are the same as in @xmath23 ; only edges between @xmath162 and @xmath163 have changed . as a consequence , the point of @xmath81 from @xmath164 and",
    "the neighbors of @xmath1 in @xmath169 determine a cycle of @xmath169 ( figure [ fig.localiz ] , bottom , left ) .",
    "the other points that remain on @xmath164 are of depth @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , after the insertion of @xmath1 , de depth of @xmath2 changes from @xmath158 to @xmath80 .",
    "( at the top ) and @xmath3 ( at the bottom ) . ]",
    "in this work we have studied the delaunay depth function , the stratification that this depth induces in the point set ( layers ) and in the whole plane ( levels ) , and developed algorithms for computing the _ delaunay depth contours _ and the depth of any query point set with respect to the given point set .",
