    "type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) have long been recognised as being close binary systems where one of the stars , a carbon - oxygen white dwarf ( c+o wd ) , undergoes a thermonuclear runaway after reaching explosive conditions at its centre ( e.g. , branch et al .  1995 , and references therein ) .",
    "the physics of the explosion is determined by both components of the system . while the ejecta left by the explosion have been studied in great detail ,",
    "the direct search for the companion is a relatively new approach ( ruiz - lapuente 1997 ) that has already started to give results ( ruiz - lapuente et al .",

    "sne  ia are the best cosmological distance indicators , and they were used to discover the accelerating expansion of the universe ( riess et al .  1998 ;",
    "perlmutter et al .  1999 ) .",
    "while they are well characterised for empirical use as cosmological probes , there are still significant gaps in our theoretical understanding of them . in principle",
    ", sne  ia can be produced through two different channels : the single - degenerate ( sd ) channel and the double - degenerate ( dd ) channel ( whelan & iben  1973 ; webbink  1984 ; iben & tutukov  1984 ; livio & truran  1992 ; branch et al .",
    "1995 ; ruiz - lapuente  1997 ; livio  2000 ; ruiz - lapuente et al .",
    "2003 ) . in the sd channel , the progenitor wd approaches the chandrasekhar mass by accreting matter , in a close binary system , from a companion star that is thermonuclearly evolving ( the nondegenerate component ) .",
    "the companion could be a giant , a subgiant , or a main - sequence star . in the dd channel ,",
    "the binary consists of two wds which eventually merge , thereby giving rise to the explosion ; no bound object is left . in the sd channel ,",
    "on the other hand , the companion star should survive the explosion and show distinguishing properties .",
    "the predictions of how the companion star would look after the impact depend on the star s physical properties before the explosion ( canal et al .  2001 ;",
    "livio  2000 ; marietta et al .",

    "2013 ; liu et al .  2012 , 2013 ) .",
    "to test the binary scenario , we observed and modeled stars within the 15% inner radius of tycho s sn 1572 ( rl04 ) . previous research ( ruiz - lapuente  1997 ; canal et al .  2001 ;",
    "ruiz - lapuente et al .",
    "2003 ) had pointed out that the most salient feature of the surviving companion star should be peculiar velocities with respect to the average motion of the other stars at the same location in the galaxy ( mainly due to disruption of the binary ) , detectable through radial - velocity and proper - motion measurements , and perhaps also signs of the impact of the sn ejecta .",
    "the latter can be twofold .",
    "first , mass should have been stripped from the companion and thermal energy injected into it , possibly leading to the expansion of the stellar envelope and making the star have a lower surface gravity ( marietta et al .",
    "2000 ; podsiadlowski  2003 ) .",
    "second , depending on the interaction with the ejected material , the surface of the star could be contaminated by the slowest - moving ejecta ( made of fe and ni isotopes ) .",
    "determination of the metallicity is also needed in order to exclude the star belonging to the halo or thick disk .",
    "the observations in rl04 , therefore , were designed along these lines .",
    "the search for the binary companion of tycho s sn 1572 has produced a likely candidate : a g - type subgiant star labelled tycho - g ( rl04 , gh09 ) .",
    "the star is relatively close to the centre of the supernova remnant ( snr ) , its distance is compatible with being inside the snr , it has significantly higher radial velocity and proper motion ( pm ) than stars at the same location in the galaxy , and it shows signs of pollution from the sn ejecta .",
    "the radial velocity , @xmath9 km s@xmath3 in the local standard of rest , is about 2@xmath4 above the average for stars at the distance of the snr .",
    "especially significant , however , is the pm measured with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) in programs go-9729 ( cycle 12 ) and go-10098 ( cycle 13 ) : @xmath10 mas yr@xmath3 , @xmath11 mas yr@xmath3 . at a distance of 3",
    "kpc , this gives a tangential velocity of @xmath12 km s@xmath3 , but the disk velocity dispersion is much smaller .",
    "it seems very difficult , therefore , to account for the observed pm , except through some sort of binary interaction .",
    "this point was later challenged by kerzendorf et al .",
    "( 2009 , hereafter k09 ) . from comparison of a photographic plate taken in 1970 with the palomar 5-m telescope and a ccd image taken in 2004 ( used in rl04 ) with the 2.5-m isaac newton telescope , k09 concluded that no significant pm was detected : @xmath13 mas yr@xmath3 , @xmath14 mas yr@xmath3 .",
    "however , the measurements prior to the present work ( rl04 ) , also based on _ hst _",
    "images , again gave a significant pm : @xmath15 mas yr@xmath3 , and @xmath16 mas yr@xmath3 ( maximal external errors using the three epochs 2003 , 2004 , and 2005 ) . more recently , a pm of about 5 mas yr@xmath3 was also obtained using the same publicly available cycle 16 _ hst _  data ( kerzendorf et al .",
    "2013 , hereafter k13 ) , but the error bars remain quite large .",
    "any improvement in the pm measurements of the stars significantly increases information on the pre - explosion binary system .",
    "the peculiar velocity of a surviving companion would correspond largely to its orbital velocity just before the explosion , since the kick due to the impact from the ejecta is a secondary effect ( marietta et al .",
    "2000 ) . from the mass of the companion ( the wd being near the chandrasekhar mass when it explodes ) ,",
    "the orbit prior to the explosion can be reconstructed , if we assume that both the radial and tangential velocities of the centre of mass of the binary were typical for the distance and galactic latitude of the snr .    with the present work we aim to refine the evolutionary path to the explosion of sn 1572 by reducing by an order of magnitude the uncertainties in the pms of the stars .",
    "this improvement is now possible because almost eight years have passed between the acs / wfc 2003 images and the new ones ( taken in late 2011 , during _",
    "cycle 19 ) .",
    "after the publication of rl04 , there were claims that the proposed companion of sn 1572 , tycho - g , was a giant star , with log(@xmath17/cm - s@xmath18 ) = @xmath19 dex and at a distance @xmath20 kpc ( schmidt et al .",
    "keck hires spectra taken in 2006 did show that tycho - g is , in fact , rather similar to the sun , as was already discussed by rl04 .",
    "the analysis of these new observations ( gh09 ) confirmed that it is a g - type subgiant , with @xmath21 k , log(@xmath17/cm - s@xmath22 ) = @xmath23 dex , and @xmath24 } = -0.05 \\pm 0.09 $ ] .",
    "it is thus neither a halo star nor a typical thick - disk star .",
    "its distance is entirely compatible with that of the snr ( around 3 kpc ) .",
    "moreover , a chemical abundance analysis showed a clear excess of ni ( and , to a less significant extent , of co ) , which could point to possible contamination of the star s surface layers by the sn ejecta ( gh09 ) .",
    "additional support for the single - degenerate origin of tycho s sn has been obtained recently from x - ray observations ( lu et al .",
    "2011 ) , and the characteristics of the binary have been partially reconstructed based on the results of rl04 .",
    "concerning the pm issue , very recently k13 have also analysed our now publicly available go-9729 and go-10098 _ hst _ images and derived values in agreement with previous results by rl04 . in particular",
    ", they confirm the high velocity of tycho - g , perpendicular to the galactic plane . in the present work , in which we use _ hst _ observations spanning nearly 8 years",
    ", a similar result is obtained , but with an almost tenfold precision .    .f555w",
    "data used in this work . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab1 ]    other stars close to the centre of tycho s snr are occasionally suggested as possible companions , such as tycho - e ( ihara et al .",

    "more complete knowledge of the pms of all stars in the field , in addition to tycho - g , was thus crucial ( see sec .",
    "here we first present and discuss the new astrometric work ( sec .  2 and 3 ) . in section  4",
    "we redetermine the ni abundance of tycho - g , using the same hires spectrum as in gh09 but a new procedure , and we compare it with the galactic trend , also defined by new high - quality data .",
    "we reconstruct the binary orbit of the star ( sec .  5 ) , assuming tycho - g to be the surviving sn companion , and from that we deduce its radius at the time of the explosion , when it was filling its roche lobe . in section  6 ,",
    "we discuss the kinematics of tycho - g and its significance .",
    "we evaluate the probability of picking at random a star that combines all of its characteristics ( sec .  6 ) .",
    "sections  7 and 8 briefly discuss the uncertainties in the exact site of the sn explosion and the luminosity evolution of a sn companion after the impact of the sn ejecta . in section  9 , the data on the other 23 stars with @xmath7 mag and within @xmath8 of the centroid of the snr x - ray emission are presented and discussed .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section  10 .",
    "the observations used to derive the pm measurements presented here come from _ hst _ programs go-9729 , go-10098 , and go-12469 ( pi ruiz - lapuente ) , which span @xmath25 yr . data were collected with both the wide field channel ( wfc ) of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) , and the ultraviolet - visual ( uvis ) channel of the wide field camera  3 ( wfc3 ) .",
    "all of these images were taken with the filter f555w , available for both cameras . however , we note that the two total transmissions ( instrument+filter ) are slightly different . for precise astrometric measurements and a more accurate assessment of the uncertainties",
    ", we took particular care to dither our new wfc3/uvis images properly , with both large whole - pixel and fractional - pixel offsets ( following the general recipes given by anderson & king 2000 ) .",
    "this was not the case during previous acs / wfc epochs , resulting in some limitations to our achieved accuracies .",
    "table 1 lists both the acs / wfc and wfc3/uvis observations , while fig .",
    "[ deep ] shows the depth - of - coverage map for each of the four epochs , after being transformed into the same reference system .",
    "ccd detectors in the harsh radiation environment of space suffer degradation owing to the impact of energetic particles , which displace silicon atoms and create defects .",
    "these defects temporarily trap electrons , resulting in charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) losses and in trailing of the sources ( because electrons are released at a later time ) .",
    "these effects have a major impact on astrometric projects ( anderson & bedin 2010 ) .    in this work ,",
    "every single acs / wfc image employed was treated with the pixel - based correction for imperfect cte developed by anderson & bedin ( 2010 ) .",
    "the algorithm is now improved and directly included in the acs pipeline .",
    "standard calibrated products are produced both with ( _ flc exposures ) and without ( _ flt images ) this correction .",
    "this correction proved to be effective in restoring fluxes , positions , and the shape of sources , and reducing systematic effects of imperfect cte even in the worst case of extremely low backgrounds ( anderson & bedin 2010 ; ubeda & anderson 2012 ) . the wfc3 team is still working to develop and calibrate a similar capability for uvis ; therefore , no cte mitigation was operated on wfc3/uvis images in this work .",
    "however , the relative `` youth '' of uvis s ccds and the large - dither strategy of our new observations provide a good handle on the astrometric biases resulting from imperfect cte , as well as on other systematic sources of errors .",
    "we measured positions and fluxes for every star in every _ flc acs / wfc exposure , using a library of spatially variable effective point - spread functions ( psfs ) and the software programs documented by anderson & king ( 2006 ) . unfortunately ,",
    "due to the sparseness of the tycho - g field , it was not possible to perturb the psfs to account for small focus variations .",
    "( we will see in sec .",
    "[ bc ] how we have mitigated this and other systematic biases in our astrometry . ) as in bedin et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2006 ) , we used the best available average distortion corrections ( anderson 2002 , 2005 ) to correct the raw positions and fluxes of sources that we had measured within each individual acs / wfc _ flc exposure .",
    "positions and fluxes of sources in each wfc3/uvis _ flt image were obtained with software that is adapted from the program img2xym_wfi ( anderson et al .",
    "astrometry and photometry were then corrected for pixel area and geometric distortion using the best available average distortion corrections and library psfs ( bellini & bedin 2009 ; bellini et al .",
    "to derive proper motions , we essentially follow the detailed procedures given by anderson & van der marel ( 2010 , hereafter av10 ) to measure the internal motions of the stars in the core of the populous globular cluster @xmath26 centauri . however , we need to take into account that the tycho - g field has major differences with respect to the field studied by av10 .    our astrometric measurements , like those of av10 , are relative to a group of objects in the observed field . as a reference ,",
    "av10 used cluster members ; there are hundreds of stars per square arcminute having high signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) , all at a common distance , and sharing a common pm to within a few 0.1 mas yr@xmath3 ( the internal velocity dispersion of @xmath26 cen is less than 20 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "by contrast , our tycho - g field is sparsely populated , with only a few objects per square arcminute .",
    "furthermore , the reference stars are at different distances and have different pms .",
    "we also note that no obvious and suitable background object is present in our field , as a result of the high extinction at low galactic latitudes ( @xmath27 ) . in our tycho - g field ,",
    "the uncertainties in our pms are dominated by the pm dispersions of the stars with respect to which we measure the positions at the different epochs , even selecting stars that moved the least with respect to each other .",
    "nonetheless , our long temporal baseline of @xmath25 yr improves the final precision to levels comparable to those reached by av10 .",
    "pixels around tycho - g in each of the 38 images available to us ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) . the first eight are from the uvis epoch , and the next 30 from acs ( specifically , 10 collected in 2003 , then 10 from 2004 , and the last 10 from 2005 ) .",
    "[ imagette ] , width=321 ]      the first important step is to build a distortion - free _ reference frame _ using all of the images taken within a chosen epoch ( the _ reference epoch _ ) , with respect to which we will later perform _ all _ of the relative measurements .",
    "for this task we selected our recent wfc3/uvis epoch , as this epoch is the one with the largest number of deep observations , optimal dithering , and covering the largest fraction of the other previous epochs ( see fig .  [ deep ] ) .",
    "in addition , because of its better pixel sampling , wfc3/uvis intrinsically provides better imaging astrometry ( @xmath28 mas ; bellini et al .",
    "2011 ) compared with acs / wfc ( @xmath29 mas ; anderson & king 2006 ) .    to build the reference frame , we began by identifying bright , isolated , and unsaturated sources measured within each wfc3/uvis _ flt image of program go-12469 . among these , we then selected those having a stellar profile . to measure the stellarity of objects",
    ", we use the `` quality - fit '' ( q - fit ) parameter described by anderson et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , which essentially quantifies how close the distribution of the observed pixel values resembles the local psf model .",
    "this selection allowed us to immediately reject most cosmic ray ( cr ) hits , warm pixels , artifacts , and potentially also extended nonstellar objects .",
    "with caution , this enabled us to use those portions of the field observed only once in the reference epoch ( i.e. , those regions for which there is only one exposure in the reference epoch ) .",
    "we initially took as a reference the distortion - corrected positions measured in the deep image , which is at the centre of the wfc3/uvis dither pattern , and linearly transformed the star positions ( distortion - corrected ) from all of the other images into that frame .",
    "we then determined an average position for each star that was found in at least five exposures . in doing this",
    ", we used the most general linear transformations ( 6 parameters ) .    to improve this reference frame",
    ", we found a linear transformation from each exposure into the new frame , based on the positions of common stars .",
    "for each star in the reference frame , we thus had between five and eight estimates for its position ( depending on how many images overlapped at that point ) , and we averaged these positions together to improve the reference frame .",
    "after a few such iterations , the root - mean square ( rms ) of these multiple ( and dithered ) observations was less than 0.01 pixels for the brightest stars ( with 5 or more observations ) .    to extend the reference frame where there are fewer than five images , we used the same transformations obtained above to include the objects with faint magnitudes and a stellar profile , and stars measured only in four , three , two , and one image .",
    "the resulting reference frame contains 1148 objects ( a few of which are artifacts or remaining crs ) .",
    "its spatial distribution , together with the rms in magnitude and in @xmath30 and @xmath31 positions , are shown in fig .",
    "[ rf ] .      as extensively discussed in sec .",
    "[ bc ] , the adopted geometric distortion correction is just an average solution , and from frame to frame there are sizable changes .",
    "this is particularly true for the linear terms , which contain the largest portion of the variations .",
    "so far , in deriving the reference frame , we used 6-parameter linear transformations to register the distortion - corrected positions measured in each frame to the distortion - corrected positions measured in the reference image ; the linear - term variations with respect to the reference image were completely absorbed by the 6 parameters .",
    "therefore , the astrometric zero points , plate scales , orientations , and skew terms of our adopted reference frames are still not calibrated to an absolute reference system .",
    "we used sources in common between our reference frame and the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass , skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) to determine the unconstrained linear terms . within our tycho - g region",
    "we found @xmath32 2mass point sources in common with our reference frame which we used to calibrate our linear terms .",
    "the constrained linear terms enabled absolute astrometry accurate to @xmath33 .",
    "as previously mentioned , the relative positions of stars are much more accurate than their absolute zero points .",
    "the nonlinear part of the acs / wfc and wfc3/uvis distortion solutions is accurate to @xmath34 original - size wfc3/uvis pixel ( @xmath350.5 mas ) in a global sense ( anderson & king 2006 ; bellini et al .  2011 ) , roughly the random positioning accuracy with which we can measure a bright star in a single exposure .",
    "recently , it has been discovered that the linear terms of the acs / wfc distortion solution have been changing slowly over time ( anderson 2007 ) .",
    "even if this were the case also for wfc3/uvis , we note that in our procedure the linear terms are constrained by the 2mass catalog .",
    "the absolute coordinates are referred to equinox j2000.0 , with positions given at the reference epoch , 2011.858 .      with the transformations from the coordinates of each image into the reference frame it becomes possible to create a stacked image of the field within each epoch .",
    "the stack provides a representation of the astronomical scene that enables us to independently check the region around each source at each epoch .",
    "the stacked images are 15,000 @xmath36 15,000 super - sampled pixels ( by a factor 2 ; i.e. , 20 mas pixel@xmath3 ) , and corresponding to @xmath37 . the stack for the wfc3/uvis 2011 epoch is shown in fig .  [ stack ] .",
    "we have included in the header of the image , as world coordinate system ( wcs ) keywords , our absolute astrometric solution based on the 2mass point - source catalog , as described in the previous section .",
    "as part of the material provided in this paper , we give the astrometrised stack - image for the reference epoch electronically online .    in fig .",
    "[ imagette ] , we show a mosaic of the @xmath38 pixel field for all 38 images , centred on tycho - g .",
    "positional imaging astrometry in _ hst _ images is so precise that it allows us to appreciate small variations from frame to frame , even if collected consecutively within a same orbit .",
    "for example , the velocity of _ hst _ around the earth ( @xmath39 km s@xmath3 ) causes light aberration , inducing plate - scale variations up to 5 parts per 100,000 ( cox & gilliland 2003 ) that can be measured clearly ( anderson et al .  2007 ; bellini et al .",
    "there are also less predictable time - dependent changes caused by the temporal variation of the _ hst _ focus .",
    "these focus variations are correlated with thermal variations induced by the angles between the sun and the telescope tube ( the so - called `` breathing '' ) ; they result in changes in the geometric distortion and in position - dependent psf variations , which in turn are the result of a complicated interplay between aberrations and charge diffusion across the detector ( jee et al .",
    "therefore , the astrometric distortion solutions provided by anderson & king ( 2006 ) for acs / wfc and by bellini et al .",
    "( 2009 , 2011 ) for wfc3/uvis should be intended only as _",
    "average _ geometric distortion solutions . the same considerations are also valid for the adopted library ( and thus _ average _ ) psfs .",
    "our estimated positions could thus change appreciably from frame to frame when using library psfs and average distortion solutions .    to account for these small but sizable effects ,",
    "av10 introduced local adjustments to the measured positions , which they call `` boresight '' corrections .",
    "these corrections are determined for each star in each frame as follows . for each exposure that included the star ,",
    "we calculate a robust average offset between the globally transformed ( into the reference frame ) positions of the neighbouring stars and the average reference - frame positions of the same neighbouring stars .",
    "this average offset provides the correction to the transformed position of the target star for that exposure .",
    "hence , the reference frame contributes only to the plate scale and orientation ( see av10 for details ) . for images collected in the same epoch as the reference frame , we selected among neighbouring stars only those having positions within 0.05 wfc3/uvis pixels from their positions in the master frame , but within 1 wfc3/uvis pixel for the other acs / wfc epochs .",
    "( we must be more generous from epoch to epoch , as the displacements also contain the intrinsic motions of stars . )    in the case of av10 these corrections were extremely local , over a few tens of pixels , since the set of reference stars was very dense . but",
    "owing to the sparseness of the tycho - g field , our local set ( used for the boresight corrections ) includes neighbouring stars up to 1000 uvis pixels from the target stars ( i.e. , a @xmath40 of a wfc3/uvis field ) , thereby making these corrections not very `` local . ''",
    "thus , our boresight correction will remove only residuals with this spatial scale .",
    "also , the boresight correction is calculated only if at least 6 suitable objects are available within 1000 uvis pixels from the target .",
    "typically we had @xmath41 objects , but for short exposures the paucity of stars forced us to accept as few as 6 .    the top panels in fig .",
    "[ bore ] show the `` plain '' ( or raw ) residuals between positions measured in individual frames and the reference frame .",
    "the corresponding boresight corrections are given in the second panels from the top , while the `` boresight - corrected '' residuals are shown in the third panels .",
    "the bottom panels display the spatial distributions of the sources with respect to the reference frame .",
    "we note that these boresight corrections are small within the reference epoch , of order @xmath34 wfc3/uvis pixels ( @xmath35 mas ) , but they can be as large as 0.1 pixels ( @xmath42 mas ) from one epoch to another .    here",
    "we must make an important consideration concerning the achievable accuracy of our pms ( @xmath43 ) , which are described in the next section .",
    "the accuracies we can hope to achieve ( @xmath44 ) are ultimately set by _ both _ the pm dispersion ( @xmath45 ) and the number of neighbouring stars ( @xmath46 ) used to derive the boresight corrections .",
    "these accuracies can be formulated in the relation [ for each of the two 1d pm components , ( @xmath47,@xmath48 ) ] as @xmath49 this statistical `` kinematic noise '' of the network of stars , whose positions are not fixed with respect to each other , dominates our uncertainties .",

    "in each half , the upper panel shows the displacement ( in mas ) for the four epochs as a function of time from the reference epoch ( in years ) .",
    "the blue line is the weighted best fit to the data points ( circles from deep exposures and squares from short exposures ) , and its slope is the pm .",

    "the data points from deep exposures are indicated with ( red ) open circles , while those from short exposures with ( red ) open squares .",
    "data points from saturated images are not used .",
    "the blue lines are our weighted best _ linear _ fit to the data points , where for weights we adopted the raw fluxes measured in the individual images . in this way , when both short and long exposures are available ( as is the case for tycho - g ) , data points coming from short exposures receive negligible weights . indeed , short exposures are the most affected by cte , and by statistical limitations related to the paucity of reference stars having good s / n .",
    "therefore , the slopes of the blue lines are our estimates for the pms of tycho - g .",
    "these are labeled in the figure as @xmath47 and @xmath52 with their formal errors .",
    "the average of the displacements should be null at the reference epoch .",
    "note that in fitting the data , we let the positions at the reference epoch float freely ; consequently , @xmath53 and @xmath54 indicate the corrections to be applied to our reference - frame positions at epoch 2011.858 . however , these small corrections make sense only in relative terms , the uncertainties in the absolute positions being dominated by the uncertainties in the 2mass absolute zero points . the lower panels in each half of fig .",

    "however , in those models , a velocity offset of the inner ejecta ( with respect to the original centre of the star ) is attributed to the deflagration phase of the explosion , while the more spherically symmetric mass ejection is produced by the transition from deflagration to detonation , closer to the surface .",
    "it is hard to imagine that while the inner layers are moving away from the original centre , the centroid of the outer layers remains anchored in that position .",
    "thus , in this type of asymmetric explosion , neither the present centroid of the fe - rich ejecta nor that of the outer ejecta should correspond to the position of the centre of the wd at the time of the explosion .",
    "no similar analysis has been done for sn 1572 , but the spectrum of its light echo suggests that the explosion was also aspherical ( krause et al .",
    "2008 ) .    among the stars with @xmath174 mag ,",
    "the closest one to the chandra x - ray centroid is tycho - b ( see fig .",
    "[ tychofield ] , and tables 2 and 3 ) .",
    "in order of increasing distance are stars tycho - a , -c , -e , -d , -f , -j , and then -g .",
    "as discussed in section  9 , none of these other stars shows any sign of being related to the sn explosion .",
    "the luminosity of tycho - g is within the range @xmath175 , as calculated from its effective temperature and surface gravity ( assuming a mass of 1 m@xmath119 ; gh09 ) .",
    "what should be expected for the companion of a sn as recent as sn 1572 ?",
    "podsiadlowski ( 2003 ) calculated the luminosity evolution of a subgiant star of 1 m@xmath119 , @xmath176 , and @xmath177 , after being hit by the ejecta of a sn  ia .",
    "he assumed that 0.2 m@xmath119 were removed by the impact ( based on the hydrodynamic calculations of marietta et al .",
    "2000 ) , and that variable amounts of energy were deposited uniformly in the outermost 90% of the radial extent of the remaining object ( containing 0.57 m@xmath119 ) .",
    "such amounts ranged from @xmath178 erg ( close to the energy needed to unbind those layers completely ) down to zero .",
    "he found , in all cases , that the luminosity evolution was initially much faster than the kelvin - helmholtz time scale of the presupernova subgiant , since it was determined by the thermal time scale of the outer layers of the star , which is many orders of magnitude shorter .",
    "depending on the amount of energy deposited , the luminosity of the companion , 440 yr after the sn explosion , might range from @xmath179 to @xmath180 ( see fig . 2 in podsiadlowski 2003 ) .",
    "the result also depends strongly on the mass of the star at the time of the explosion and on the amount of mass removed by the explosion ( which , in turn , depends on the evolutionary stage of the subgiant ) .",
    "recently , shappee et al .  (",
    "2013 ) have calculated the post - explosion evolution of a main - sequence companion of 1 m@xmath119 . from the hydrodynamic simulations of pan",
    "et al .  ( 2012a ) , which show that in this case most ( @xmath181% ) of the mass lost from the impact of the ejecta is due to ablation ( heating by the shock front ) and the rest ( @xmath182% ) is removed by stripping ( momentum transfer by the shock ) , they construct an initial model by heating the whole star until it generates a stellar wind able to expel the same amount of mass that is lost by ablation in the hydrodynamic calculation .",
    "they then follow the evolution of the star by means of a standard one - dimensional code , finding that after @xmath183 yr , the luminosity of the companion should still be @xmath184 , while @xmath185 k. note that their pre - explosion model has a radius @xmath186 , significantly smaller than that inferred in section 5 for tycho - g at the same stage under the assumption that it was the companion of sn 1572 .    pan et al .",
    "( 2012b ) , based on their own hydrodynamic models ( pan et al .",
    "2012a ) , find that the evolution of the remnant star strongly depends not only on the amount of energy absorbed from the explosion , but also on the depth of the energy deposition .",
    "they calculate the evolution of several pre - explosion models through the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic stages .",
    "one of them ( their model e ) , 440 yr after the explosion , is the closest in mass , radius , and effective temperature to tycho - g , having a luminosity higher than that of tycho - g by only a factor of two .",
    "again , however , the initial model is more compact than tycho - g should have been at the time of the explosion . as it can be seen from the hydrodynamic simulations of marietta et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , the less compact the star is , the more mass is removed by stripping and less by ablation , which also means less energy deposited into the layers that remain bound .",
    "we stress once again that the calculations that predict , for a stellar sn  ia companion 440 yr after the explosion , luminosities higher than that of tycho - g , have all been made for main - sequence stars , and that the outcomes might be significantly different for even slightly more evolved ones ( a point that also affects rotation , as indicated in section 6 ) .",
    "the reconstruction of an evolutionary scenario , leading to a pre - explosion configuration similar to the one deduced in section 5 , should include nonconservative mass transfer and the different evolution of the orbital separation before and after inversion of the mass ratio between the two stars .",
    "we also note that , depending on the amount of mass lost from the impact of the sn ejecta , on the amount of energy injected , and on how that energy is distributed inside the remaining star , the object might not have reached thermal equilibrium yet ; it could be slowly expanding on a kelvin - helmoltz time scale , obtaining energy for this from internal sources , as suggested by podsiadlowski ( 2003 ) .",
    "in rl04 , radial velocities were measured and distances estimated for 13 stars ( including tycho - g ) located within an angular distance of @xmath187 from the centroid of the x - ray emission of tycho s snr and with @xmath7 mag , as well as for 3 slightly more distant stars , up to @xmath188 from the same point and also brighter than the said magnitude ( tables 1 and s3 of rl04 ) . although pms measured with wfpc2 aboard _ hst _ were graphically displayed in figure  1 of rl04 , they were numerically given only for tycho - g .",
    "now , with the much more precise pms in table 2 of the present paper , and with new estimates of the distances for some of those stars , we can rediscuss the kinematics of the sample and the possible association of each of its members with sn 1572 . in table 3",
    "we give @xmath189 photometry , estimated distances , and velocities @xmath190 ( parallel to the celestial equator ) and @xmath191 ( perpendicular to it ) for the full set of 24 stars located within @xmath8 from the x - ray centroid ( see fig.[tychofield ] for labels and positions ) and brighter than @xmath192 mag .",
    "we briefly comment on each of them next .",

    "the radial velocity is thus consistent with the distance for a star belonging to the galactic thin disk , and the small total tangential velocity is also typical of such a stellar population .",

    "the components of the tangential velocity , calculated from the pms in table 2 ( @xmath205 km s@xmath3 , @xmath206 km s@xmath3 ) , are again typical of its population .",
    "it should be noted that the high rotational velocity measured by k13 , @xmath207 km s@xmath3 , is well within the range covered by stars of its spectral type ( abt & morrell 1993 , 1995 ) .",
    "thompson & gould ( 2012 ) have attempted to relate tycho - b to the sn , based on the low metallicity found by k13 , by making it a member of a quadruple system : one binary pair giving a double wd system that produces the sn , plus another pair merging into a blue straggler ( tycho - b ) .",
