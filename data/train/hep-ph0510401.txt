    "recently leps and diana collaborations @xcite reported the observation of a very narrow peak in the @xmath8 and @xmath9 invariant mass distribution which existence has been confirmed by several experimental groups in various reaction channels @xcite .",
    "these experimental results were motivated by the pioneering paper on chiral soliton model @xcite . the reported mass determinations for the @xmath10",
    "are very consistent , falling in the range 1540@xmath1110 , with the width smaller than the experimental resolution of @xmath12 mev for the photon and neutrino induced reactions and of 9 mev for the itep @xmath13 experiment .    from the soliton point of view",
    "the @xmath10 is nothing exotic compared with other baryons ",
    "it is just a member of @xmath14 multiplet with @xmath15 .",
    "however , in the sense of the quark model @xmath16 baryon with positive amount of strangeness is manifestly exotic ",
    "its minimal configuration can not be satisfied by three quarks .",
    "the positive strangeness requires an @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 refers to the lightest quarks @xmath20 ) are required for the net baryon number , thus making a pentaquark @xmath21 state as the minimal `` valence '' configuration .",
    "later na49 collaboration at cern sps @xcite announced evidence for an additional narrow @xmath22 resonance with @xmath23 , a mass @xmath24 gev and a width below the detector resolution of about 18 mev(1860 ) decaying into @xmath25 . ] and h1 collaboration at hera @xcite found a narrow resonance in @xmath26 and @xmath27 invariant mass combinations at @xmath28 gev and a measured gaussian width of @xmath29 mev , compatible with the experimental resolution . the later resonance is interpreted as an anti - charmed baryon with a minimal constituent quark composition of @xmath30 , together with the charge conjugate .",
    "the discoveries of first manifestly exotic hadrons mark the beginning of a new and rich spectroscopy in qcd and provide an opportunity to refine our quantitative understanding of nonperturbative qcd at low energy .",
    "the @xmath10-hyperon has hypercharge @xmath31 and third component of isospin @xmath32 .",
    "the apparent absence of the @xmath33 , @xmath34 in @xmath35 argues against @xmath36 , therefore it is usually assumed the @xmath10 to be an isosinglet .",
    "the other quantum numbers are not established yet .    as to the theoretical predictions we are faced with a somewhat ambiguous situation , in which exotic baryons may have been discovered , but there are important controversies with theoretical predictions for masses of pentaquark states .",
    "the experimental results triggered a vigorous theoretical activity and put a renewed urge in the need to understand of how baryon properties are obtained from qcd .",
    "all attempts of the theoretical estimations of the pentaquark masses can be subdivided into following four categories : ( i ) dynamical calculations using the sum rules or lattice qcd @xcite , ( ii ) the phenomenological analyses of the hyperfine splitting in quark model @xcite , ( iii ) phenomenological analyses of the @xmath37 mass relations , and ( iv ) dynamical calculations using the chiral @xmath38 quark model @xcite ) .",
    "the qcd sum rules predict a negative parity @xmath39 of mass @xmath40 gev , while no positive parity state was found  @xcite .",
    "the lattice qcd study also predicts that the parity of the lowest @xmath10 hyperon is most likely negative @xcite .",
    "the naive quark models , in which all constituents are in a relative @xmath41-wave , naturally predict the ground state energy of a @xmath42 pentaquark to be lower than that of a @xmath43 one .",
    "however , using the arguments based on both the goldstone boson exchange between constituent quarks and color - magnetic exchange it was mentioned that the increase of hyperfine energy in going from negative to positive parity states can be quite enough to compensate the orbital excitation energy @xmath44 mev . however",
    ", existing dynamical calculations of pentamasses using the chiral @xmath38 quark model ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) are subject to significant uncertainties and can not be considered as conclusive .",
    "pentaquark baryons are unexpectedly light .",
    "indeed , a naive quark model with quark mass @xmath4 350 mev predicts @xmath39 at about @xmath45 mev plus @xmath4 150 mev for strangeness plus @xmath4 200 mev for the @xmath46-wave excitation . a natural remedy would be to decrease the number of constituents .",
    "this leads one to consider dynamical clustering into subsystems of diquarks like @xmath3 ^ 2\\bar s$ ] @xcite and/or triquarks like @xmath3[ud\\bar s]$ ] @xcite which amplify the attractive color - magnetic forces .",
    "in particular , in @xcite it has been proposed that the systematics of exotic baryons can be explained by diquark correlations .",
    "the quark constituent model have not been yet derived from qcd .",
    "therefore it is tempting to consider the effective hamiltonian ( eh ) approach in qcd ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) which from one side can be derived from qcd and from another side leads to the results for the @xmath47 mesons and @xmath48 baryons which are equivalent to the quark model ones with some important modifications .",
    "the eh approach contains the minimal number of input parameters : current ( or pole ) quark masses , the string tension @xmath49 and the strong coupling constant @xmath50 , and does not contain fitting parameters as , e.g. , the total subtraction constant in the hamiltonian",
    ". it should be useful and attractive to consider expanding of this approach to include diquark degrees of freedom with appropriate interactions .",
    "the preview of this program was done in @xcite .",
    "it is based on assumption that chiral and the short range gluon exchange forces are responsible for the formation of @xmath51 diquarks in @xmath10 while the strings are mainly responsible for binding constituents in @xmath10 . in this paper",
    "we review and extend application of the eh approach to the jaffe ",
    "wilczek model of pentaquarks .    in this model inside @xmath52 and other @xmath53 baryons",
    "the four quarks are bound into two scalar , singlet isospin diquarks .",
    "diquarks must couple to @xmath54 to join in a color singlet hadron . in the quark model",
    "five quarks are connected by seven strings . in the diquark approximation the short legs on this figure",
    "shrink to points and the five - quark system effectively reduces to the three - body one , studied within the eh approach in @xcite . in total",
    "there are six flavor symmetric diquark pairs @xmath3 ^ 2 $ ] , @xmath3[ds]_+$ ] , @xmath55 ^ 2 $ ] , @xmath55[su]_+$ ] , @xmath56 ^ 2 $ ] , and @xmath56[ud]_+$ ] combining with the remaining antiquark which give 18 pentaquark states in @xmath57 plus @xmath14 .",
    "all these states are degenerate in the su(3)@xmath58 limit .",
    "the eh for the three constituents has the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the kinetic energy operator , @xmath61 is the sum of the perturbative one - gluon exchange potentials and the string potential @xmath62 .",
    "the dynamical masses @xmath63 ( analogues of the constituent ones ) are expressed in terms of the current quark masses @xmath64 from the condition of the minimum of the hadron mass @xmath65 as function of @xmath63 : . in practice , these fields are finally treated as @xmath66-numbers determined from ( [ minimum_condition ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath67 @xmath68 being eigenvalue of the operator @xmath69 .",
    "quarks acquire constituent masses @xmath70 due to the string interaction in ( [ eh ] ) . as of today the eh in the form of ( [ eh ] ) does not include chiral symmetry breaking effects . a possible interplay with these effects",
    "should be carefully clarified in the future .",

    "( [ eta_i ] ) @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 are the correction factors due to nonvanishing current masses of the strange , charm and bottom quarks , respectively .",
    "the self - energy corrections are due to constituent spin interaction with the vacuum background fields and equal zero for any scalar constituent .",
    "accuracy of the eh method for the three - quark systems is @xmath79 mev or better @xcite .",
    "one can expect the same accuracy for the diquark  diquark(anti)quark system .    consider a pentaquark consisting of two identical diquarks with current mass @xmath80}$ ] and antiquark with current mass @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) . in the hyperspherical formalism",

    ", the lightest state must have a wave function antisymmetric under diquark space exchange .",
    "there are two possible pentaquark wave functions antisymmetric under diquark exchange , the first one ( with lower energy ) corresponding to the total orbital momentum @xmath91 , and the second one ( with higher energy ) corresponding to @xmath92 . for a state with @xmath93",

    "this shape moves continuously to a two - legs configuration where the legs meet at an angle larger than @xmath110 .",

    "the current masses of the light quarks are relatively well - known : @xmath113 , @xmath114 mev .",
    "the only other parameter of strong interactions is the effective mass of the diquark @xmath80}$ ] . in principle , this mass could be computed dynamically .",
    "instead , one can tune @xmath80}$ ] ( as well as @xmath115}$ ] and @xmath116}$ ] ) to obtain the baryon masses in the quark  diquark approximation .",
    "we shall comment on this point later on .    in",
    "what follows , we use @xmath117 , and explicitly include the coulomb - like interaction between quark and diquarks with @xmath118 .    for the pedagogy , let us first assume @xmath80}=0 $ ]",
    "this assumption leads to the lowest @xmath1 and @xmath21 pentaquarks .",
    "if the current diquark masses vanish , then the @xmath3 ^ 2\\bar d$ ] pentaquark is dynamically exactly analogous to the @xmath42 nucleon resonance and @xmath3 ^ 2\\bar s$ ] pentaquark is an analogue of the @xmath42 @xmath119 hyperon , with one important exception .",
    "the masses of @xmath46-wave baryons calculated using the eh method acquire the ( negative ) contribution @xmath120 for @xmath42 nucleons and @xmath121 for the @xmath42 hyperons .",
    "these contributions are due to the interaction of constituent spins with the vacuum chromomagnetic field . using the results of table 1 below we get the mass of the @xmath46-wave nucleon resonance with the orbital @xmath122 excitation 1600 mev and the mass of @xmath119 hyperon 1600 mev that within 100 mev agrees with the known @xmath46-wave @xmath123 and @xmath119 resonances .",
    "however , the above discussion shows that the self - energies @xmath124}$ ] equal zero for the scalar diquarks .",
    "this means that introducing any scalar constituent increases the pentaquark energy ( relative to the @xmath123 and @xmath119 @xmath46-wave resonances ) by @xmath125 mev . therefore prior",

    "in fact to apply this techniques to the three - body sse we need to use an approximation of the three - body potential @xmath135 by a sum of the two- and one - body potentials , see @xcite .",
