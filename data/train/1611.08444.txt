    "the work presented here should be of interest both to the frequentist with an interest in bayesian asymptotics , and to the bayesian that has an eye for asymptotic , frequentist arguments .",
    "following bayarri and berger ( 2004 ) @xcite ( _ `` statisticians should readily use both bayesian and frequentist ideas . '' _ ) , we illustrate how bayesian asymptotic conclusions can be converted into conclusions valid in the frequentist sense : how doob s prior - almost - sure consistency is supplemented to reach the frequentist conclusion that the posterior is consistent , or how a bayesian credible set has to be enlarged in order for it to become a frequentist confidence set , for example .    the central property imposed on the prior that allows frequentist interpretation of bayesian asymptotics , defined as _ remote contiguity _ in subsection  [ sub : rc ] , expresses a weakened form of le  cam s contiguity , relating the true distribution of the data to localized prior predictive distributions .",
    "where schwartz s kullback - leibler neighbourhoods represent a choice for the localization appropriate when the sample is _ i.i.d .",
    "_ , remote contiguity generalizes the notion to include non-_i.i.d .",
    "_  samples , priors that change with the sample size , weak consistency with the dirichlet process prior , _ etcetera_.",
    "although this work firstly concerns generalization and simplification in well - studied asymptotic questions , it also has a novel and very practical consequence : the fourth theorem in section  [ sec : four ] demonstrates in full generality that credible sets can be ` enlarged ' in a way prescribed by remote contiguity , to convert them to asymptotically consistent confidence sets .",
    "so the asymptotic validity of credible sets as confidence sets implied by the bernstein - von  mises theorem extends much further : to find asymptotic confidence sets in practice , the frequentist can ( mcmc-)simulate posteriors and ` enlarge ' resulting ( hpd-)credible sets if he uses a prior that induces the right type of remote contiguity .    in the subsection that follows",
    ", we formulate the posterior consistency question and present some early answers as well as counterexamples and related problems . in section  [ sec : post ] we concentrate on an inequality expressing asymptotic concentration of posterior mass if a test sequence exists and indicate the relation with le  cam s inequality @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : rc ] introduces remote contiguity and the analog of le  cam s first lemma . in section  [ sec : four ] , four frequentist theorems on the asymptotic behaviour of posterior distributions are proved , on posterior consistency , on posterior rates of convergence , on consistent testing and model selection with bayes factors and on the conversion of credible sets to confidence sets .",

    "but in non - parametric context these null - sets can be very large ( or not , see @xcite ) : the first non - parametric examples of unexpected inconsistency of the posterior are due to schwartz ( 1961 ) @xcite , but it was freedman who made the point famous with a simple non - parametric counterexample that is discussed in some detail as example  [ ex : freedman63 ] .",
    "the implication was that _",
    "choices for the prior could lead to unforeseen instances of inconsistency . but",
    "freedman s construction required knowledge of the true distribution of the data , so it was possible to argue that his counterexample amounted to the demonstration that unfortunate circumstances could be created , but were probably not of great concern in a more generic sense .",
    "two years later , freedman constructed priors of the problematic type _ without _ knowing the true distribution of the data .",

    "so freedman s theorem says that posteriors that continue to wander around , placing and re - placing mass aimlessly , are the rule rather than the exception and the set of pairs @xmath11 for which the posterior is consistent is _ meagre _ in @xmath14 .",
    "many conclusions have been drawn from these and subsequent examples of posterior inconsistency , the most damaging of which was wide - spread acceptance among frequentists that bayesian methods were generically unfit for frequentist purposes , at least in non - parametric context .",
