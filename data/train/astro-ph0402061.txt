    "ejection or expansion of magnetic fields from an accretion disk @xcite or a shocked galactic wind @xcite are possibilities for the origin of these structures . in addition , the discovery of isolated nonthermal filaments throughout the inner few hundred parsecs ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with orientations largely perpendicular to the galactic plane have been interpreted as evidence for a space - filling poloidal field in the ionized medium @xcite .",
    "a pervasive poloidal field could result from the inflow of a primordial halo field toward the high concentration of mass in the gc @xcite or from a nuclear star burst as stellar winds and supernovae inject stellar fields into the surrounding medium @xcite .",

    "thus , both ejection of dynamo generated fields and inflow and concentration of primordial fields could be acting independently to create the observed structures .",

    "observationally the nonthermal filaments ( ntfs ) are unique to the gc and are defined and identified by ( 1 )  extreme length to width ratios ( tens of parsecs long and only a few tenths of a parsec wide ) ; ( 2 )  nonthermal spectral indices ; and ( 3 )  high intrinsic polarization ( for recent reviews see * ? ? ?",

    "[ the lone ntf parallel to the plane , assuming a gc distance of 8 kpc @xcite , is located southwest about  75  pc in projection from the galactic plane and the farthest from , approximately 225  pc in projection .",
    "it therefore could be in a region where the field lines are merging with the toroidal field in the disk @xcite . ]",
    "several estimates for the strength of ntf magnetic fields can be made .",
    "estimates based on radio continuum measurements and assuming equipartition field strengths are of the order of a few tenths of a milligauss for several filaments ( the , @xcite ; the filament , @xcite ; the , @xcite ) .",
    "the absence of any bending or distortion of the ntfs against the strong ram pressure of the gc molecular clouds indicates a field strength of about  1  mg ( @xcite ; see @xcite for further discussion of this point ) .",
    "such a field strength is considerably stronger than the general interstellar magnetic field , which is typically no more than a few tens of microgauss ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the implied internal magnetic pressures of the ntfs are so large that unless they are confined by a comparable pressure , their lateral dimensions would expand well beyond the observed few tenths of a parsec on timescales short compared to their synchrotron lifetime .",
    "confinement is not an issue if there is a @xmath1  mg field filling the entire region . in that case",
    "the ntfs are those flux tubes that happen to be illuminated with high energy electrons that are energized by some local interaction .",
    "the energy density of such a space - filling field is quite high , of the order of @xmath2  ergs  @xmath3 and the total magnetic energy is @xmath4  ergs , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the radius and length ( in pc ) of the cylindrical region over which the ntf phenomenon is found .",
    "however , alternatives to the pervasive field interpretation are also viable ( e.g. , yusef@xmath7zadeh 2003 ; @xcite ) . in the cometary model of @xcite ,",
    "the ntfs are magnetized wakes generated by the interaction of molecular clouds with a gc wind .",

    "the existence of a gc wind and related outflows is discussed in the context of recent high resolution infrared observations by @xcite . in the cometary model the wind",
    "is assumed to advect a weak @xmath8  @xmath9 g magnetic field that is amplified by a factor of roughly 100 as the field is stretched by the flow and wraps around the obstacle , a molecular cloud , forming an elongated magnetotail ( for simulations , see * ? ? ?",

    "the total required magnetic energy is reduced by several orders of magnitude and presumably ntfs with every orientation could be observed since they are viewed in projection .",

    "recently improved wide - field , high sensitivity , high resolution , vla imaging of the gc at 90  cm @xcite has revealed twenty new ntf candidates , identified solely on the basis of their morphology . figure  [ fig : fig1.eps ] shows the inner @xmath10 of the full 90  cm image produced by @xcite .",
    "it was constructed from a combination of vla a- and b - configuration observations , with a resulting resolution of @xmath11 .",
    "although it is not sensitive to large - scale , low surface brightness features , this image shows all previously known ntfs except for which was significantly resolved .",
    "the ntfs appear because their angular extent in one dimension is comparable to or smaller than the beam .",
    "the previously known ntfs are mainly perpendicular to the galactic plane . however , the orientations of the candidate ntfs are more diverse , with several nearly parallel to the plane .",
    "the candidates are also considerably shorter , with many less than 10  pc in length .",
    "the surface brightnesses of the candidates ( 1520  ) are roughly a factor of  4 or so less than the more prominent ntfs @xcite .",
    "in retrospect a number of these candidates have been detected at higher frequencies .",
    "the candidate ntfs in the region can be seen on the high resolution 20  cm image of @xcite , who referred to shorter filamentary structures as `` streaks . ''",
    "in addition several candidates near were detected by @xcite at  18  cm .",
    "although the morphologies of these ntf candidates are suggestive , spectra could not be constructed for all of them nor had any polarization observations been conducted . in order to confirm their status as ntfs , we conducted vla observations of six ( 6 ) of these sources at  6  cm in  2002 october .",
    "the observations were conducted with the vla in the cnb configuration , providing a resolution of @xmath12 ( significantly higher than at  90  cm ) .",
    "full polarization information was recorded .",
    "the visibility data were calibrated and imaged using standard techniques within aips . both total intensity",
    "( stokes  i ) and linearly polarized intensity ( stokes  q and  u ) images were formed .",
    "the galactic nonthermal background along the plane remains significant even at  6  cm and , despite integration times of several hours per source , it was not possible to achieve signal - to - noise ratios exceeding 5 in the total intensity images .",
    "the low signal - to - noise ratio also compromised our ability to detect polarization . in some cases , we were able to detect the total intensity emission from a source but no polarized emission .",
    "for the total linear polarized intensity ( @xmath13 ) , a rice - nakagami distribution is obtained , and the upper limits we quote are relative to the rms noise level in the q and  u images , @xmath14 .",
    "nonetheless , these various limitations did not preclude our identifying a number of these candidates as ntfs .",
    "we concentrated on several candidates in the and regions , which we describe individually .",

    "the surface    brightness at  18  cm is not uniform .",
    "the peak brightness    ( @xmath15  ) occurs at the southern terminus where the    source is clearly wider , and the brightness decreases uniformly    to  1  at the northern end .",
    "intensity profiles perpendicular to the    source s major axis show a clear double peak at the south end ,    suggesting there may be two filaments in this system .",
    "the length of    this source , assuming a galactic center distance of  8  kpc is    @xmath16  pc .",
    "the 90  cm resolution is a factor of  3 poorer    and does not show any structural details .",
    "+    figure  [ fig : fig4.eps ] shows the 6  cm polarized image of .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig5.eps ] shows the polarized intensity in grey scale    overlain with contours of total intensity .",
    "the polarization is patchy ,    similar to what is observed for other ntfs .",
    "the peak fractional    polarization is 65% and the average fractional polarization is    @xmath1750% .",
    "this is consistent with the polarizations seen    in other ntfs .",
    "the polarized image has a significantly better    signal - to - noise ratio than the total intensity image , which is limited    by the strong background emission from the galactic plane .",
    "the object    is also 8  pc long at  6  cm and @xmath18 0.5  pc wide .",
    "given    the similar beam sizes at  6 and  18  cm , we convolved the 6  cm image to    the resolution of the 18  cm image and formed a series of intensity    profiles at constant declination .",
    "these profiles were used to    determine the peak brightness as a function of length along the    structure and estimate the spectral index .",
    "the different spatial    frequency ( @xmath19-@xmath20 ) coverage in the  6    and  18  cm observations complicate the determination of an absolute    spectral index .",
    "however , this analysis should reveal relative changes    of spectral index with position . as figure  [ fig : fig6.eps ] illustrates ,    to within the uncertainties , the spectral index is constant ,    @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , along the length of the filament .",
    "this constancy with    position is consistent with other well - studied ntfs @xcite .",
    "spectral curvature appears to be another characteristic of the    phenomenon .",
    "typical 20/90  cm and 6/20  cm spectral indices are between    -0.4 and -0.6 but above 5 ghz the spectrum turns over @xcite . using    the same method as described above we estimated the 18/90  cm spectral    index near the location of the peak flux .",
    "we find    @xmath23 .",
    "thus our 6/18  cm index is    steeper than typical but our 18/90  cm index is flatter . as we    mentioned determining",
    "an absolute spectral index is problematic but we    can confidently conclude that this source is nonthermal . based on    morphology , percentage polarization , and the nonthermal spectral index    we classify this source as an .",
    "ntf  359.43@xmath240.13 : :    this candidate lies northwest of the filament . at",
    "90  cm it has a    distinctive ` x`-shape .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig7.eps ] shows that at  6  cm the    ` x ` is resolved into a very bright , slightly elongated source ; two , or    perhaps three , longer filaments with significant curvature running    roughly parallel to the galactic plane ; and another filament    perpendicular to these .",
    "polarization of @xmath25 was    detected near the location of the peak brightness .",
    "the signal - to - noise    ratio along the filamentary structures is only 23 .",
    "unfortunately , at    this low signal - to - noise ratio , we would not have detected polarized    emission , even if these filaments were ntfs with high polarizations .",
    "thus we can not state categorically that these sources are ntfs .",
    "however given their morphology it would be difficult to build a case    for an alternative classification .",
    "ntf  359.40@xmath70.07 : :    this source is the brightest ntf candidate at 90  cm and lies 5  pc    south in projection from the filament .",
    "it was also detected at 18  cm    @xcite .",
    "we detect in total intensity at 6  cm , but we do not detect    what appears to be a faint extension of this source in the 90  cm image    ( ) . using the 90  cm image to delineate the approximate extent of the    source , we find the total linear polarization intensity distribution    within this region to be noise - like with no linear polarized emission    above  4.5@xmath14 , where    @xmath26  @xmath9jy  beam@xmath27 .    the lack of polarized emission ( if the source is in fact polarized ! )    may be a consequence of the strong background emission . to obtain a    rough estimate of the spectral index we convolved the 6  cm map to    18  cm map and made a few cross@xmath7cuts near the location of    the peak emission .",
    "we find that the 6/18  cm spectral index is    @xmath28 .",
    "employing a similar procedure    for the 18 and 90  cm maps we estimate that the 18/90  cm spectral index    is @xmath29 .",
    "there is considerable error in convolving    the higher resolution maps to a larger beam in a confused region such    as this and we hestitate to draw any firm conclusions from these    results .",
    "further observations will be required to classify this    source .",
    "ntf  0.37@xmath70.07 , ntf  0.39@xmath240.05 , and ntf  0.39@xmath70.12 : :    these three linear features are in the region .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig8.eps ]    shows the region at  90  cm @xcite , figure  [ fig : fig9.eps ] shows    the region at  6  cm total intensity , and figure  [ fig : fig10.eps ]    shows  6  cm total and linear polarized intensity overlayed . due to the    low signal - to - noise ratio only ,",
    "was detected in polarization .",
    "the    peak fractional polarization is 45% while the average fractional    polarization is @xmath1735% .",
    "it appears that and could be    part of the same filament .",
    "their clear linear morphology and similar    orientation to the filaments in the gcra strongly suggests they are    ntfs .",
    "+    they are located about  64  pc in projection from and are the first    filaments found north of the .",
    "although they are parallel to the gcra    filaments , they are located farther south of the galactic plane .",
    "thus ,    these objects extend the length scale ( and therefore volume ) over    which the ntf phenomenon is know to occur to almost 300  pc along the    galactic plane . if the ntfs are a consequence of a global magnetic    field , the field must be organized on at least this size scale .",
    "the 6  cm observations show that all the observed ntf candidates are filamentary in nature , with a several of them showing polarization .",
    "although only 3 of the 6 candidates exhibited the expected polarization , the low signal - to - noise would have precluded detecting polarized emission from the remainder , even if they were polarized at the level typical of ntfs . generalizing these results ,",
    "we conclude that many of the 90  cm ntf candidates probably are true ntfs .",
    "consequently there may be a large population of shorter , low surface brightness ntfs .    are these shorter , low surface brightness ntfs the same class of phenomenon as the longer , brighter ntfs that are already known ?",
    "@xcite shows that the typical surface brightness of the new filaments is approximately 20  at  90  cm ; the surface brightness of the previously known filaments is 80  .",
    "the flux density @xmath30 as a function of frequency  @xmath31 from a synchrotron source of volume  @xmath32 is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a number density of synchrotron - emitting electrons and  @xmath35 is the magnetic field within the volume .",
    "the widths of the new filaments are comparable to those of the previously known , prominent ntfs , of order a few tenths of a parsec . assuming that these are approximately cylindrical objects , then the volume element per unit length is the same for both the previously known and newly identified filaments . for a spectral index @xmath36",
    ", the luminosity of a synchrotron source scales with magnetic field as @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , in order to reproduce the observed range in surface brightnesses requires that the product @xmath38 vary by only a factor of  4 .",
    "either a factor of  4 variation in the synchrotron - emitting electron number density or a factor of  2 in the magnetic field strength is sufficient .",
    "of course , if both @xmath34 and  @xmath35 vary , even smaller variations in each are required in order to obtain the required variation in @xmath38 .",
    "we conclude that the same physical process could be responsible for the entire population with small local variations in magnetic field strength and/or energetic particle density accounting for any differences",
    ".    a larger number of ntfs offers additional insights into the structure of any large@xmath7scale magnetic field .",
    "is oriented at an angle of  45  to the galactic plane and is only the second ntf that is not oriented more - or - less perpendicularly with respect to the galactic plane .",
    "it is also the considerably closer to ( 87  pc in projection ) than the other parallel ntf , ( the pelican ) .",
    "there is considerable evidence that the magnetic field in the neutral medium along the galactic plane in the and regions is parallel to the plane ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggesting that there is a large - scale toroidal field in the neutral medium . given its 45  orientation",
    ", it seems unlikely that this ntf is related to a toroidal field .",
    "furthermore scuba images @xcite of the galactic center indicate that the thermal emission from the environment is much less than in the or regions .",
    "thus , the region near , including may not be dominated by the neutral medium .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig11.eps ] is schematic of the gc region based on the wide@xmath7field image of nord et al ( 2003a , b ) .",
    "the confirmed ntfs ( including those from this work ) are shown in the heavy dark lines while the ntf candidates are denoted by the thin lines .",
    "confirmation of additional candidates would definitively rule out a global dipole field model .",
    "however , the present data is already difficult to reconcile with global ordering .",
    "figure 10 shows that there are several cases where two ntfs , which are close together in projection , have very different orientations . in order to preserve @xmath39 in a region of space , distinct field lines must be more or less parallel on scales smaller than any gradient scale",
    ". the northern end of is 15  pc in projection from the filament and has an orientation @xmath40 to it .",
    "the filament is about  30  pc long and , although it has a nonuniform brightness , it exhibits a constant spectral index with length , suggesting that it is tracing a uniform magnetic field . for a dipole magnetic field @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the radial distance from the dipole . for a dipolar field centered on at the location of ( 87  pc in projection )",
    "the gradient scale length is almost 30  pc , consistent with the .",
    "however , if is at the same distance with a @xmath43 difference in orientation , it could not be tracing the same global , divergence - free field .",
    "another example is the northern thread and the ntf candidate .",
    "these two are separated by only about  5  pc in projection and both are about  30  pc in projection from , yet their orientations differ by  25 .    these differences in orientation can not be explained as due to differences in their relative distances . while little is known about their relative separations ,",
    "as noted earlier the ntf phenomenon occurs over a linear distance of roughly 300  pc along the galactic plane ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the ntfs are also distributed over a comparable distance along the line of sight .",
    "if this is the case , large apparent changes in orientation could be obtained in a dipolar field by filaments well above the galactic plane and located at different distances along the line of sight ( e.g. , the northern thread and the ntf candidate ) .",
    "even so , if the gc magnetic field is poloidal and dominated by a dipolar component , all filaments crossing the galactic plane should be nearly perpendicular to the galactic plane , regardless of their distance along the line of sight .",
    "the different orientations of the filament and demonstrate that the gc magnetic field can not be dominated by a largely dipolar , poloidal component .    the new 90  cm survey coupled with the 6  cm observations described here indicate that the population of galactic center ntfs is significantly larger than previously thought .",
    "these new ntfs can not be interpreted as components of a globally ordered poloidal magnetic field and suggest a more complicated field structure .",
    "further , high sensitivity observations , especially with new instrumentation such as the expanded vla and lofar ( see kassim et al 2003 ; white , kassim & erickson 2003 ) will be required to discover and characterize the entire population of galactic center ntfs .",
