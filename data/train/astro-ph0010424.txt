    "since supernova shocks are one of the few mechanisms known to be capable of providing adequate energy to supply the pool of galactic cosmic rays , supernova remnants ( snrs ) have long been suspected as the primary site of galactic cosmic ray acceleration , at least up to the slight steepening in the cosmic - ray spectrum at a few @xmath4 ev , known as the `` knee . ''",
    "direct evidence for energetic particles comes from radio observations of synchrotron emission from 110 gev electrons .",
    "however , in the cosmic rays observed at earth , at a few gev electrons are about 50 times less numerous than cosmic - ray ions , whose spectrum is an unbroken power law from @xmath5 ev to 10@xmath6 ev .",
    "these considerations raise two questions : 1 ) do snrs accelerate ions ? 2 ) are they capable of accelerating _ any _ particles to energies of 10@xmath6 ev ?",
    "this paper addresses the second question by demonstrating the presence of electrons of energies of hundreds of tev in the remnant of sn 1006 ad .",
    "high - energy electrons can produce x - rays via nonthermal bremsstrahlung and synchrotron radiation , and gamma - rays from inverse - compton upscattering of any photons present .",
    "relativistic protons can produce @xmath7-rays from the decay of @xmath8 particles produced in inelastic collisions with background gas .",
    "these processes have recently been studied in detail by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the analysis of x - ray and gamma - ray observations of shell supernova remnants may give direct evidence bearing on both questions above .",
    "in this paper we will interpret observed x - rays and tev gamma - rays as primarily synchrotron radiation and inverse - compton upscattered cosmic microwave background radiation , respectively , and will obtain maximum electron energies and electron shock acceleration efficiencies  crucial information for understanding shock acceleration in general , and the origin of galactic cosmic rays .",
    "the earliest evidence of nonthermal x - ray emission in a shell supernova remnant came from the featureless spectrum of sn  1006 ad ( g327.61.4 ) @xcite , explained as the loss - steepened extrapolation of the radio synchrotron spectrum by @xcite .",
    "however , early data were poor and the models were simplistic .",
    "thermal models by @xcite seemed able to produce a featureless x - ray spectrum , given a high degree of elemental stratification in ejecta .",
    "however , observations by   @xcite showed unmistakable evidence for nonthermal emission in the rims , along with thermal , line - dominated emission in the interior .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that detailed , self - consistent synchrotron models could be constructed which adequately described the pre-   integrated spectrum of sn  1006 as the diminishing extension of the radio spectrum , reproducing the slope reported by @xcite in the rim .",
    "while @xcite proposed a modified thermal bremsstrahlung model based on the model of @xcite , even the author concluded that it is not an appropriate fit for sn  1006 .    since then",
    ", several more shell snrs have been shown to have nonthermal , non - plerionic emission .",
    "in addition to sn  1006 @xcite , g347.3 - 0.5 ( rj j1713.7 - 3946 ) @xcite has nearly featureless x - ray spectra clearly dominated by nonthermal emission .",
    "some remnants , while not dominated by nonthermal emission in the  band , show other evidence pointing to its presence .",
    "observations of cassiopeia a at 400 - 1250 kev @xcite are well described by a broken power law , steepening to higher energies @xcite .",
    "rcw 86 @xcite shows anomalously low abundances when fit with thermal models . when the fit includes a synchrotron model the abundances fall within expected ranges @xcite .    an important consequence of synchrotron x - ray emission was pointed out by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "electrons capable of producing kev synchrotron photons in magnetic fields of a few microgauss will also produce high - energy photons by inverse - compton scattering any photon fields .",
    "in particular , inverse - compton upscattering of cosmic - microwave - background photons can produce tev gamma rays , and @xcite explicitly predicted a range for the expected tev flux of sn  1006 ( subsequently found by the cangaroo air erenkov telescope ) .",
    "the predicted flux depends only on the electron distribution , so it can be used , in conjunction with observed synchrotron fluxes , to deduce a mean magnetic - field strength in a remnant . subsequent extensive calculations by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite included this effect",
    ".    however , nonthermal x - ray emission from shell supernova remnants could be due to bremsstrahlung from nonrelativistic electrons with energies of a few tens of kev @xcite rather than synchrotron radiation from electrons with energies of hundreds of tev .",
    "careful models ( e.g. , @xcite as well as @xcite ) show that in neither case are straight power - laws to be expected .",
    "synchrotron spectra should all be steepening ( convex up ) while bremsstrahlung spectra , resulting from the lowest energy cosmic ray electrons departing from the maxwellian tail , ought to be flattening ( concave up ) .",
    "@xcite showed that the  spectrum from sn  1006 steepens to higher energies , and the discovery of the predicted tev gamma rays by the  collaboration @xcite provided strong evidence that the nonthermal x - ray emission in sn  1006 is in fact synchrotron radiation .",
    "however , nonthermal bremsstrahlung is expected to be important for some remnants , and as more observations become available above 10 kev , it will be necessary to discriminate between synchrotron and nonthermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "( while most analyses , e.g. , @xcite , conclude that the tev emission from sn  1006 is inverse - compton , @xcite and @xcite assert that the @xmath8-decay mechanism may be partly responsible . )    despite the strong evidence for curvature , a straight power law is still commonly regarded as a defining characteristic of x - ray synchrotron radiation in shell supernova remnants , as it is in crab - like supernova remnants and active galactic nuclei .",
    "while power laws will certainly be a better description of synchrotron emission produced by the particle spectra expected in snr shock acceleration than quasi - thermal exponential continua , all snr x - ray synchrotron continua are expected to be substantially curved , even over a relatively narrow energy range .",
    "however , in almost all published studies , nonthermal snr x - ray emission has been described by a power law .",
    "this purely phenomenological treatment , while characterizing the emission , fails to explain its origin .",
    "power laws can not continue forever rising as the frequency drops , a fact camouflaged by the rapidly dropping response of x - ray instruments at low energies .",
    "broken power laws can avoid this `` infrared catastrophe , '' but they still duck the question of the origin of the emission and its relation to the lower - energy synchrotron spectrum . since no galactic supernova remnant has x - ray emission bright enough to lie on the unbroken extrapolation of the radio spectrum @xcite , extrapolating from radio measurements will grossly over - predict the x - ray flux , as demonstrated in figure [ fluxes ] .",
    "the spectrum must drop significantly below the observed power law in the radio to be consistent with the x - ray flux measurements . a good physical model",
    "must both fit this turnover and explain the mechanism causing the spectral curvature .",
    "some spectral modeling of snr synchrotron x - rays has been done using other descriptions .",
    "while a power law represents a spectrum with no curvature , the maximum curvature likely to result from shock acceleration comes from an electron spectrum with an exponential cutoff . in the approximation",
    "in which each electron radiates all its energy at the peak frequency of the single - particle synchrotron emissivity ( the `` @xmath9-function approximation '' ) , this implies a photon spectrum @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite modeled synchrotron emission from sn  1006 using this expression , with a constant maximum energy @xmath11 . as was demonstrated in @xcite the @xmath9-function approximation is not accurate well above the turnover energy . in addition",
    ", the electron distribution will vary throughout the remnant .",
    "a convolution of the electron synchrotron emissivity with the calculated electron distribution at each location in the remnant is required .",
    "the model described in this paper includes the full electron emissivity .",
    "it is important to understand and accurately characterize the synchrotron emission in snrs .",
    "if the emission mechanism in those snrs with clear nonthermal continua is synchrotron radiation , then many snrs could have varying amounts of synchrotron x - ray emission , contributing part of the continuum emission alongside the thermal lines and continuum . as demonstrated by rcw 86 @xcite ,",
    "such an unmodeled component stymies thermal fits by preventing accurate measurements of shock temperatures and elemental abundances .",
    "understanding either the thermal or nonthermal x - ray emission from snrs requires appropriate modeling of both components .",
    "this paper applies a model that assumes sedov dynamics and a power - law distribution of electrons up to a maximum energy , which can vary with time and with location in the remnant . in general , the maximum energy attained by electrons in the shock acceleration process could be limited by one of several factors  electrons above this energy could escape from the remnant , the remnant could be so young it has not had time to accelerate particles beyond some , or  could be the energy at which radiative losses balance further acceleration .",
    "normally , a remnant s spectrum would first be limited by age , and then by radiative losses , unless escape prevented either of the other limits from being reached .    in this paper",
    "we analyze new  observations , along with archival  observations , in section [ sec : observations ] .",
    "we discuss the escape model , _ sresc _ , in section [ sec : model ] , along with our new gamma - ray modeling , and compare  to thermal models and a thermal+power law model in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "in section [ sec : discuss ] , we discuss the elemental abundances we infer from the joint thermal - nonthermal model , and compare them to predictions by @xcite and @xcite and discuss the implications of our results for the efficiency of electron acceleration .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "on 1819 february 1996 , sn  1006 was observed for 21 kiloseconds with the proportional counter array ( pca ) of the   satellite .",
    "a summary of  observations can be found in table [ rxte ] .",
    "the  is a spectrophotometer comprised of an array of five co - aligned proportional counter units that are mechanically collimated to have a field - of - view of @xmath12 at full width , half maximum .",
    "the array is sensitive to 260 kev photons and has a maximum collecting area of about 7000 @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the instrument was pointed at a location on the bright north - eastern rim ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) .",
    "the angular diameter of sn  1006 is small enough ( about @xmath16 ) that the entire remnant was in the field - of - view of the instrument .",
    "the total event - detection rate during this observation is @xmath17 count s@xmath18 in the range 310 kev .",
    "the background spectrum of the pca data was estimated using version 1.5 of the program _",
    "pcabackest_. this version includes estimates of the charged - particle and diffuse cosmic x - ray backgrounds based on the `` vle '' count rate during observations of `` blank - sky '' regions and an estimate of the background associated with the decay of radioactive material that is activated when the spacecraft passes through the south atlantic anomaly .",
    "the count rate of the estimated background is @xmath19 count s@xmath18 ( 310 kev ) .",
    "time intervals during which ( 1 ) one or more of the five proportional counter units is off , ( 2 ) sn  1006 @xmath20 above the limb of the earth , ( 3 ) the background model is not well defined , and ( 4 ) the nominal pointing direction of the detectors @xmath21 from the specified pointing direction are excluded from the present analysis .",
    "the count - rate attributed to sn  1006 during the 6.6 kiloseconds of the observation that satisfies these four criteria is @xmath22 count s@xmath18 .    during the proposal phase",
    "we were concerned with possible contamination from lupus and special effort was made to obtain off - source spectra in addition to spectra from sn  1006 ad .",
    "lupus , a thermal source , is not expected to produce significant emission above 3 kev and preliminary examination of  data from lupus reveal spectra very similar to the cosmic x - ray background .",
    "this data has also been analyzed by allen ( * ? ? ?",
    "* allen et al .",
    "2000 , in preparation ) .",
    "sn  1006 has been observed several times with  in the performance verification phase and later cycles .",
    "a summary of the  observations used in this paper can be found in table [ asca ] .",
    "backgrounds for were obtained from off - source portions of the same chip .",
    "backgrounds for were taken from the 3 november 1999 dark earth event files .",
    "since sn  1006 is located in the galactic anticenter , 15  off the plane , galactic emission should not contribute significantly to the background .",
    "in section [ sec : north ] we fit observations of the north limb of sn 1006 , using areas from a single chip plus the equivalent portions of the . in section [ sec : full ] we fit three   observations of the whole remnant ( 2 & 3 , for a total of six data sets ) obtained from 1993 - 1996 . since  has no spatial resolution and a 1  field of view",
    "only the full fields of the can be simultaneously fit with  observations .",
    "two models were proposed for the pre - asca integrated spectrum of sn  1006 in @xcite , with different mechanisms causing the rolloff in the electron spectrum : an age - limited model , which required an upstream magnetic field of only 0.6 @xmath23gauss , and an escape - limited model , in which the upstream magnetic field could be much larger .",
    "the tev detection @xcite constrains the mean magnetic field in the remnant , as described below , to be of order 10 @xmath23gauss , ruling out the age - limited model .",
    "( the third category of model , radiative - loss - limited , could not fit the pre - asca data . )",
    "we therefore consider only the escape - limited model as a description for sn  1006 .",
    "the model  presented in this paper and discussed in @xcite describes snr emission with electron energies limited by escape , which accounts correctly for variation of shock - acceleration efficiency with obliquity and for post - shock radiative and adiabatic losses .",
    "the model makes the following assumptions : 1 ) the remnant dynamics are well described by the sedov self - similarity solution ( we eliminate the singularity at the center of the sedov solution by truncating the emissivity at a radius where the velocity of the shock=10,000 , an ejection velocity appropriate to type ia supernovae ) ; 2 ) the remnant is expanding into a uniform medium with a uniform magnetic field , @xmath24 ; 3 ) the density increases by a fixed factor @xmath25 downstream of the shock  this means that the magnetic field strength increases by a factor between 1 and @xmath25 as the tangential component is compressed , depending on the angle between the shock normal and the upstream magnetic field ; 4 ) the postshock magnetic field evolves by flux - freezing , with no turbulent amplification after the initial compression ; 5 ) the relativistic electrons have short postshock diffusion lengths so that their density evolves in the same way as the thermal - gas density .",
    "electrons that escape are allowed to diffuse upstream from the shock along magnetic field lines , producing a faint `` halo '' .",
    "recent models of nonlinear shock acceleration ( e.g. , berezhko yelshin & ksenofontov * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ellison , berezhko , & baring 2000 ) predict that high efficiencies of particle acceleration mimic a lossy shock , with overall compression ratios considerably higher than 4 , and correspondingly lower thermal - gas temperatures . since both the escape model and the thermal models we use below predict only post - shock quantities , they are largely independent of the compression ratio , which is used only to infer pre - shock values of density and magnetic - field strength bsed on the post - shock inferences .",
    "the thermal inferences have strictly no dependence on the compression ratio , while the details of the fainter nonthermal emission in the escape model ( where the magnetic field is parallel to the shock normal ) are slightly dependent on @xmath25 .",
    "however , for the values of @xmath26 given by the nonlinear model of @xcite , the predictions are indistinguishable from @xmath27 . in any case",
    ", the reader should bear in mind that all statements about pre - shock quantities assume some value of the compression ratio .",
    "the model describes the drop - off in synchrotron emission compared to a straight power - law . as adapted for xspec ( the x - ray spectral fitting package , *",
    "* ) it can be applied to remnants with different total radio flux densities and spectral indices . predicted images depend on the time at which the remnant was assumed to enter the sedov stage , and at the aspect angle between the upstream magnetic field and the line of sight , but these parameters do not affect the integrated spectrum .",
    "in fact , the escape model can be applied to any remnant which has been interacting with uniform - density material with a uniform magnetic field for most of its lifetime , as long as the electron spectrum is in fact cut off by escape , and not by finite remnant age or by radiative losses .",
    "this can only be checked by reference to the expressions for those maximum energies , as given for instance in @xcite ; we require @xmath28 ( escape ) @xmath29 min@xmath30 .",
    "the assumption of sedov dynamics , rather than ( say ) a late stage of self - similar driven wave into uniform material , makes little difference to the total spectrum .",
    "since most of the x - ray emission is produced closely behind the shock , the detailed form of the drop - off of synchrotron emissivity is not critical .",
    "( it would be important in modeling radio images , but not for the integrated spectrum . )",
    "the window for applicability of the escape model is probably intermediate in a remnant s life , between early times when the age limitation is most restrictive ( and in which a core - collapse remnant may be interacting with stellar - wind material with a circumferential magnetic field ) , and late times when radiative losses may be most influential .",
    "there are several reasons why electrons above some  could escape the remnant .",
    "while an intuitively obvious limit for an electron s gyroradius is the snr diameter , it has been shown that other mechanisms dominate before this limit is reached @xcite . in our diffusive acceleration picture ,",
    "acceleration occurs as electrons scatter resonantly from magnetohydrodynamic waves in the upstream and downstream fluids .",
    "while the downstream medium is likely to be highly turbulent , supporting waves of all wavelengths , this may not be true of the upstream medium , where waves are probably produced by the accelerated particles themselves . without reference to a detailed mechanism , in the escape model",
    "we assume that magnetohydrodynamic scattering waves are much weaker above some wavelength @xmath31 which corresponds to an energy  of electrons at this gyroradius .",
    "since electrons with gyroradius @xmath32 scatter resonantly with waves of wavelengths @xmath33 , electrons will escape upstream once their energy reaches an @xmath34 given by    @xmath35    ( after averaging over pitch angles ) where @xmath24 is the upstream magnetic field strength .",
    "unlike the age and loss - limited cases @xcite , here  does not change with time or depend on the angle between the shock normal and upstream magnetic field .",
    "this energy then corresponds to a photon frequency @xmath36    where @xmath37 cm , @xmath38 is the upstream magnetic field measured in microgauss and @xmath25 is the compression ratio .",
    "only one power of @xmath25 is involved since @xmath28 depends on @xmath24 , and @xmath39 only enters because @xmath40 reflects the particles with @xmath41 radiating in the stronger post - shock magnetic field .",
    "the shape of the cutoff could depend on the detailed distribution of waves , but is likely to be no steeper than an exponential .",
    "the escape model assumes an electron distribution given by @xmath42 at the shock , and evolves it appropriately in the remnant interior , including radiative ( synchrotron and inverse - compton ) and adiabatic expansion losses .",
    "at each point a synchrotron volume emissivity is found by convolving the single - electron emissivity with this distribution .",
    "model images ( shown in figure [ steve]b ) are formed by integrating along a raster scan of lines of sight and the spectrum is found by integrating the flux over the image at each frequency .",
    "the models are discussed in more detail in @xcite .",
    "the escape - limited model is particularly well suited to algorithmic fitting processes like those in xspec , since the departure from a power - law is described by a single parameter ; a universal function describes the shape of the rolloff , and the one parameter simply locates the rolloff in frequency .",
    "note from equation 2 that fixing @xmath43 does not fix @xmath44 , @xmath24 , or @xmath25 , but only the combination @xmath45 .",
    "the model can be found in xspec 11 under the name _ sresc_. the models are also expected to be available with the next release of ciao , the chandra software .",
    "the model has three parameters :    1 .   the radio flux measurement ( ) at 1 ghz 2 .",
    "@xmath46 , the radio spectral index ( flux density @xmath47 ) 3 .",
    "the characteristic rolloff frequency ( hz ) , called   ( for _ sresc _ , @xmath48 , for historical reasons ; @xmath43 is the frequency at which the spectrum has dropped by a factor of @xmath49 below the extrapolated radio power law ; @xcite )    the spectral index and 1 ghz flux for snrs are fixed by radio observations . for galactic snrs , they can be found at green s website .",
    "finally it should be emphasized that is only designed to model sedov - phase remnants whose maximum electron energy is limited by electron escape .",
    "it also presumes a remnant in or close to the sedov dynamical phase , which has been encountering a uniform upstream medium with a constant magnetic field .",
    "it is not appropriate for remnants in a highly inhomogeneous environment .",
    "it should not be applied to core - collapse remnants still interacting with stellar - wind material ( although it could be appropriate for some core - collapse remnants which have expanded beyond the pre - supernova medium ) .",
    "in addition , if the compression ratio @xmath25 is very much greater than @xmath50 , the model will overestimate fluxes from the `` poles '' where the emission is faintest , though the integrated spectrum will not be strongly affected .    since  ( synchrotron radiation cut - off model , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) describes the simplest possible synchrotron source with a minimum of assumptions , it can be applied to remnants of unknown provenance or dynamical stage more safely . until an appropriate range of models , including different dynamical stages and different external media , is available ,",
    "represent a significant improvement over fitting a power law especially if the purpose of the fit is to account for the nonthermal emission so that a thermal model may be accurately fit .",
    "models appropriate for core - collapse remnants , and describing age- and loss - limited cases have been calculated @xcite , and will also be made available in xspec when practicable .",
    "since the model has only one free parameter ( ) with both the spectral index ( ) and the 1 ghz flux ( ) specified by radio measurements , errors in these values will have an effect on the synchrotron fits , and therefore on values in the co - fitted thermal model .",
    "the sensitivity to   is substantial , since a variation of 0.05 , over a frequency range between @xmath5 hz and @xmath51 hz ( 4 kev ) , results in an offset of a factor of 3 .",
    "in addition , since many interferometer radio maps may miss smoothly distributed radio flux , care must be taken if the flux in spatially distinct regions is to be used as input to the model . in section [ sec : north ]",
    "we used to fit part of the remnant . to obtain",
    "the appropriate value of  from our 1.34 ghz interferometer map @xcite , which is missing a good deal of flux , we added a uniform flux across the image to raise the total flux in the remnant to the prediction from the radio single dish measurement of 15.9 jy , using a spectral index @xmath52 to scale the 1 ghz total flux of 19 jy @xcite .",
    "we measured the flux in the subregion , then scaled the flux to the 1 ghz value for input into the model using @xmath53 .      in the model , the spatial dependence of the electron distribution",
    "is entirely fixed by the assumption of sedov dynamics and the assumption that the relativistic - electron density tracks the thermal - gas density , with the specification of @xmath28 and @xmath24 .",
    "this dependence is calculated taking into account synchrotron and cosmic microwave background inverse - compton losses as well as adiabatic expansion losses .",
    "adding a radio flux density and spectral index fixes the normalization of the distribution , given the value of @xmath24 . given the electron distribution everywhere , it is a simple matter to calculate the morphology and spectrum of tev gamma - ray emission . to extract this prediction ,",
    "we have added the inverse - compton kernel described in @xcite , basically the full klein - nishina result , to _",

    "the model was very difficult to constrain in conjunction with thermal models .",
    "_ vpshock _ , and we suspect other thermal models as well , can seemingly adapt to nearly any amount of : larger amounts of cause lower temperatures , as contributes less of the continuum , and higher abundances , as tries to account for line emission from a lower thermal continuum .",
    "the + described the   and   observations very well , at least as well as the best + .",
    "in addition , if @xmath114 is constrained from fits to the nonthermal dominated limb observation , then remarkably has no free parameters ",
    "it uniquely specifies the synchrotron emission in the snr .",
    "this result confirms that nonthermal x - ray emission can be well described by simple synchrotron model , and the synchrotron escape model , which has previously only been tested on integrated fluxes , provides a good description of the data .",
    "high abundances of heavy elements in the + model imply that thermal emission is strongly dominated by supernova ejecta , which became obvious only after a proper separation of nonthermal and thermal components .",
    "elemental abundances in sn  1006 ejecta are clearly of great interest , but spatially - integrated  and  spectra used in this work allow only for the most basic interpretation of thermal spectra .    the _ vpshock _ model is the best first approximation for modeling x - ray spectra from shocks dominated by heavy element ejecta . because this model provides statistically and physically reasonable fits to spatially integrated  spectra , we briefly interpret our results .",
    "however , these are just preliminary results , a more detailed analysis of spatially - resolved spectra should provide more secure answers . in this future analysis",
    ", one needs to consider both the reverse and forward shock , instead of just one plane shock considered here .",
    "this analysis should also be based on full hydrodynamical models with the realistic type ia ejecta structure @xcite .    by freezing silicon",
    ", we found the best fit model required no hydrogen or helium with a 1-@xmath79 upper limit of @xmath115=2@xmath6910@xmath116 and @xmath117=3@xmath6910@xmath116 .",
    "we can use this to try and set an upper limit on the preshock density . from an upper limit on hydrogen of @xmath115=2@xmath6910@xmath116",
    "we obtain an upper limit on the preshock density of @xmath118 @xmath88 .",
    "this is somewhat less than @xmath119 of 0.050.1 cm@xmath18 ( assuming @xmath121 ) estimated by @xcite in their detailed analysis of sn  1006 .",
    "however , our value is poorly constrained , since it depends on determining the level of thermal continuum , which we can not do with certainty in the presence of much stronger nonthermal continuum .",
    "but most emission in the  model comes from heavy elements , presumably ejecta shocked by the reverse shock , and the temperature @xmath122 and ionization timescale @xmath123 in the last column of table [ fits ] most likely refer to the reverse shock .",
    "we can roughly estimate the time - averaged electron density @xmath124 in the shocked heavy - element plasma by assuming that most x - ray emission comes from material shocked in the last 500 yr ( approximately half of the remnant s age ) , which gives @xmath125 @xmath88 .",
    "this order of magnitude estimate , together with abundances and normalization of the  model from table [ fits ] , allows us to arrive at the total mass of x - ray emitting ejecta of 0.71 m@xmath126 , a lot of it ( 0.45 m@xmath127 ) in fe . while the absolute numbers are uncertain , a high fe mass is consistent with the type ia sn progenitor .",
    "extensive theoretical work has been carried out by @xcite and @xcite predicting abundances expected from different supernova types .",
    "however it has proved quite difficult in practice to compare theory directly to measured abundances in a snr .    in figure [ abund ]",
    "we compare the measured abundances @xcite with a thermal model alone ( _ vpshock _ ) , to abundances measured with a thermal + synchrotron model ( + _ sresc _ ) .",
    "the abundances are given relative to si .",
    "the predicted abundance of si for the w7 model is 0.16 m@xmath128 and 0.12 m@xmath128 for the type ii model @xcite .",
    "the abundances in our fits change significantly with the addition of the nonthermal model , bringing the measured abundances closer to models predicted by @xcite .",
    "we can take this farther and compare abundances to those predicted for type ia and core - collapse snrs .",
    "as shown in figure [ abund2 ] , the + model fit to the observations seems to agree better with type ia models , as expected for sn  1006 ; however , the uncertainties are large and the type ii model can not be ruled out .    by fixing silicon and fitting all other parameters , we are also able to calculate the total mass in each element , which we give in table [ mass ] .",
    "most notably , with the model we have found half a solar mass of iron , closer to theoretical predictions , possibly a first for type ia snr . as demonstrated in the table , while our calculated masses are not in perfect agreement with the type ia models in @xcite , they are closer to the type ia models than the type ii models .",
    "we believe these results represent an improvement in technique over past work , while at the same time considering the values obtained preliminary . improved results can be obtained by analyzing spatially resolved regions where the thermal emission dominates ( such as will be done in paper ii ) . in addition",
    "we have used only the simplest possible thermal model ( an single non - equilibrium ionization model not being physically plausible ) . however from these preliminary results we can state confidently that accurate accounting for a possible nonthermal component will be a necessary precondition to using nucleosynthesis model predictions to interpret abundances in snrs .",
    "even before the reported detection of sn  1006 in tev gamma - rays by the  collaboration @xcite , pohl ( 1996 ) calculated expected tev fluxes due to upscattering of cosmic microwave background photons by electrons of 10 - 100 tev , and the subsequent detection has been widely accepted as direct evidence for the presence in sn  1006 of such electrons .",
    "pohl calculated a range of values of predicted flux based on a homogeneous emitting volume ; the results depended on the then poorly known electron spectrum .    since the maximum photon energy @xmath129 that can be produced by an electron of lorentz factor @xmath130 upscattering photons of energy @xmath131 is given by @xmath132 , turning cosmic microwave background photons ( @xmath133 k @xmath134 ev ) into 4 tev gamma - rays requires @xmath135 .",
    "then the klein - nishina parameter @xmath136 and the thomson limit ( @xmath137 ) is marginally acceptable , at least for energies not too far above the  thresholds . in that case ,",
    "the inverse - compton volume emissivity for a thermal distribution of seed photons scattered by an electron distribution @xmath138 can be written ( rybicki & lightman 1979 , switching to photon frequencies for comparison with synchrotron ) @xmath139 where @xmath140 for @xmath141 ( values appropriate for sn  1006 ) . rewriting the electron distribution as @xmath142 with @xmath143 , and taking @xmath144",
    ", we can express the ratio of the synchrotron to inverse - compton volume emissivities as @xmath145 where @xmath38 is the magnetic field in the radiating region in units of @xmath1 .",
    "we can use this result to estimate the mean magnetic field in sn  1006 , making the simplest assumptions of a homogeneous source coextensive in synchrotron and inverse - compton emission .",
    "( the inverse - compton emitting volume will always be at least as large as the synchrotron volume , larger if electrons diffuse to where the magnetic field is weak or negligible . ) if no turnover has begun by the lower of the two  energies , the ratio of the extrapolation of the synchrotron flux to the tev flux at 1.7 tev is about @xmath146 , using a radio spectral index @xmath147 .",
    "this gives a mean magnetic field strength of 9.6 @xmath1 .    the observed radio flux density at 1 ghz of 19 jy",
    "@xcite then requires @xmath148 erg@xmath111 @xmath88 .",
    "now the immediate post - shock relativistic electron density is given by @xmath149 where @xmath150 and @xmath151 are the ends of the electron distribution , and we have assumed @xmath152 .",
    "if we let @xmath153 mev , appropriate since a constant power - law in momentum will flatten in energy below @xmath154 , we find a post - shock energy density @xmath155 which can be compared with the post - shock pressure @xmath156 for a strong shock in a gas with adiabatic index @xmath157 .",
    "so this simple estimate implies a relativistic - electron acceleration efficiency in the shock of about 2.6% .",
    "extension of the same momentum power - law to nonrelativistic energies would give a comparable amount of energy in nonrelativistic suprathermal electrons .",
    "if the shock is dominated by relativistic particles , the compression ratio could be as high as 7 , dropping the post - shock pressure by about 50% and increasing the inferred efficiency by that factor .",
    "if supernova remnants are to produce the galactic cosmic rays , efficiencies of ion acceleration must be of order several tens of percent , so given that we do not know the ratio of electron to ion acceleration efficiency , these estimates seem reasonable .",
    "they also imply a total magnetic energy content in sn  1006 of @xmath158 where @xmath159 is a volume filling factor of the emission , taken to be @xmath160 .",
    "this is far below equipartition , since the total relativistic - electron energy is @xmath161 assuming the same filling factor , and we have not taken account of ions .",
    "however , if the pre - shock magnetic field is of order 3 @xmath1 , the post - shock field due to shock compression only will be about 10 @xmath1 , so reaching equipartition would require major turbulent magnetic field amplification .      using the full spectral code ,",
    "we have calculated the spectrum shown in figure [ gammaspectra ] , using the rolloff frequency value obtained from our best fit result above .",
    "now fitting produces only the value of @xmath162 where @xmath39 is the post - shock magnetic - field strength and @xmath28 is given by ( 1 ) .",
    "( the factor 5.3 was introduced in converting the original models into xspec - readable format . )",
    "so @xmath163 there is no theoretical expectation for @xmath44 , so any value of @xmath24 can produce a particular value of @xmath43 .",
    "this degeneracy is then broken by the inverse - compton predictions which do depend on @xmath164    in figure [ gammaspectra ] , we show the model with our fitted value of @xmath165 hz , and @xmath166 cm .",
    "this model is able to reproduce the  fluxes reasonably well . in the model , the magnetic field behind the shock",
    "is compressed only , by a factor of between 1 and @xmath25 depending on the shock obliquity , and drops with distance behind the shock .",
    "the mean value of @xmath39 is approximately @xmath167 , consistent with the simple estimate above .",
    "the required value of @xmath95 is @xmath168 erg@xmath169 @xmath88 , about twice the simple estimate , implying @xmath170 and a relativistic - electron acceleration efficiency @xmath171%  somewhat higher than the simple estimate .",
    "this value was not obtained , as was the simple estimate , by assuming the thomson limit .",
    "again , a somewhat higher compression ratio does not alter the electron energy density , but by dropping the post - shock pressure slightly , can increase this value by of order 50% .",
    "the values of @xmath44 and @xmath24 give @xmath172 ergs or 32 tev from equation ( 1 ) ; this energy is in the range of the upper limits to maximum energies of synchrotron x - rays allowable in twelve other galactic remnants whose x - rays are dominantly thermal ( and far below the `` knee '' at around 1000 tev ) .",
    "the significance of this particular value of @xmath44 , above which the level of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is presumed to be much less , is not obvious ; this is the first example of this form of determination of structure in the magnetic - fluctuation power spectrum .",
    "figure [ gammaimage]b shows the predicted image in gamma rays at 1 tev .",
    "the modeling of the propagation of electrons escaping upstream is not constrained at all by x - ray fitting , since those electrons radiate in the weaker upstream magnetic field and hence contribute only a small amount of synchrotron flux .",
    "however , they contribute more significantly to the inverse - compton flux .",
    "imaging observations may allow improvements in the description of these escaping electrons .",
    "the width of the emission behind the shock is greater than for synchrotron x - rays , since the magnetic field also drops behind the shock .",
    "however , in our nonthermal models for sn  1006 , a contact discontinuity separating shocked ism from sn ejecta is still present ( modeled by the cutoff radius at which material was shocked at @xmath173 km s@xmath18 ) , and the shock - accelerated electrons are not assumed to diffuse into that region .",
    "there is no obvious reason that the ne limb , but not the sw , should be detected in tev gamma rays , especially since both limbs have very similar x - ray spectra @xcite .",
    "@xcite report that the upper limit on emission from the sw limb is about one - quarter of the emission detected from the ne .",
    "this result demands a lower relativistic - electron density by that factor .",
    "an unfortunate coincidence could allow the magnetic - field strength to be larger in the sw in such a way as to produce an identical synchrotron spectrum with a lower density of relativistic electrons .",
    "the magnetic field would need to be larger by at least @xmath174 .",
    "other possible explanations are at least as contrived , such as greater line - of - sight component of the magnetic field in the sw compensating for a lower electron density .",
    "we are unable to offer any convincing physical explanation at this time for the detection of only the northeast limb .",
    "we plan to search for spatial variations , such as variations in the value of @xmath175 , between the limbs , which might help account for the lack of tev emission from the sw , in our spatially resolved study .",
    "1 .   the escape - limited synchrotron model , _ sresc _ , provides a good fit to integrated spectral observations of sn  1006 by   and    the highest quality data to date .",
    "in addition , the spatial prediction closely matches the x - ray image in the energy range where the model applies .",
    "2 .   the model provides a significant improvement over the power - law models : 1 .   provides a more accurate description of the emission based on physical principles .",
    "2 .   allows a clearer separation of thermal and nonthermal emission , constrained by radio observations 3 .",
    "we believe an adequate description of the synchrotron emission leads to more accurate temperature and abundance measurements in the remaining thermal model , though better thermal inferences require both spatially resolved spectra ( and models ) and codes appropriate for ejecta dominated by heavy elements .",
    "evidence for enhanced abundances suggests that at least part of the thermal x - ray emission comes from ejecta .",
    "the tev gamma - ray observations allow us to determine the energy in relativistic electrons to be about @xmath2 erg ; the current shock efficiency at accelerating electrons is about 5% , and the energy in relativistic particles is much greater than that in magnetic field .",
    "we estimate that the ambient magnetic field is about 3 @xmath23gauss , and that the mhd wave spectrum near sn 1006 drops substantially in amplitude above a wavelength of about @xmath3 cm .",
    "we have demonstrated that _ sresc _ , in conjunction with inhomogeneous thermal models , can describe the full remnant emission .",
    "these models ( and in more general situations , as discussed in section [ sec : model ] ) represent a significant improvement over power - law models in describing the physics of synchrotron x - ray emission",
    ". we can now proceed to spatially - resolved spectral modeling of sn  1006",

    "<S> the remnant of sn  1006 has an x - ray spectrum dominated by nonthermal emission , and pre - asca observations were well described by a synchrotron calculation with electron energies limited by escape . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the results of a much more stringent test : fitting spatially integrated ( 0.6  8 kev ) and  ( 3  10 kev ) data with a combination of the synchrotron model newly ported to xspec and a new thermal shock model . </S>",
    "<S> the new model can describe the continuum emission above 2 kev well , in both spatial distribution and spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the emission is dominantly nonthermal , with a small but noticeable thermal component : mg and si are clearly visible in the integrated spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the synchrotron component rolls off smoothly from the extrapolated radio spectrum , with a characteristic rolloff frequency of @xmath0 hz , at which the spectrum has dropped about a factor of 6 below a powerlaw extrapolation from the radio spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of tev observations with new tev model images and spectra based on the x - ray model fits gives a mean post - shock magnetic field strength of about 9 @xmath1 , implying ( for a compression ratio of 4 ) an upstream magnetic field of 3 @xmath1 , and fixing the current energy content in relativistic electrons at about @xmath2 erg , resulting in a current electron - acceleration efficiency of about 5% . </S>",
    "<S> this total energy is about 100 times the energy in the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray fit also implies that electrons escape ahead of the shock above an energy of about 30 tev . </S>",
    "<S> this escape could result from an absence of scattering magnetohydrodynamic waves above a wavelength of about @xmath3 cm . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that joint thermal and nonthermal fitting , using sophisticated models , will be required for analysis of most supernova - remnant x - ray data in the future . </S>"
