    "recently , a new nucleosynthesis process was invented to explain the production of the proton - rich isotopes @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite . in this so called @xmath3-process , matter ejected from the surface layers of a proto - neutron star is exposed to a strong neutrino flux which results in the following weak interactions : @xmath4 the mass difference between the neutron and the proton causes the neutrino interactions to be dominated by the forward reaction of eq .",
    "( [ eq : one ] ) , which drives the nuclear matter proton - rich .",

    "( [ eq : two ] ) converts some of the free protons to neutrons , which allows nuclear matter to move past the  bottle neck \" nucleus @xmath6 via the fast @xmath7 reaction and the aforementioned proton - rich isotopes are synthesized during the freeze out phase from the proton - rich nse state @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite calculate nucleosynthesis in similar environments .",
    "we show that the nse mass fractions exhibit a great degree of symmetry across the line @xmath8 for high temperatures where the composition is dominated by free nucleons and @xmath9 for colder temperatures , ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) , there are hardly any free neutrons present in the nse state for @xmath12 . a nave guess based on symmetry of nse abundances would therefore not lead one to expect many free protons during freeze out for @xmath13 either .",
    "a large number of free protons is however observed to occur in nuclear reaction networks calculations .",
    "we show that for a relatively cold , near freeze - out temperature nse state , there is indeed a qualitative difference in the mass fraction trends for @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "restricting ourselves to the ni isotopic chain and free nucleons , we explain how this difference arises as a result of a competition between the temperature dependent entropy term and the nuclear binding energy term contribution to the free energy .",
    "nse is established if all fusion reactions are in equilibrium with their inverses for a set of thermodynamic state variables and @xmath15  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "detailed balance relates the chemical potential of a nucleus @xmath16 to those of free nucleons : .",
    "this yields an expression for the number density of nucleus  @xmath17 : @xmath18}.$ ] the nse constraint equations can be perhaps most naturally written in a number density basis as @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we solve the nse constraint equations numerically for the kinetic chemical potentials @xmath23 and @xmath24 of the ( assumed maxwellian ) protons and neutrons respectively .",
    "for the coulomb contributions @xmath25 and @xmath26 and the nuclear partition functions @xmath27 we use the same formalism as @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the results presented here are all for a baryonic mass density of @xmath28 g @xmath29 , which corresponds to a baryon number density of . at high temperature ( @xmath30 )",
    "the nse mass fractions are dominated by free nucleons and @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath31 mass fraction is symmetric across the line @xmath8 , and the mass fractions of free protons and neutrons are symmetric in a complementary sense  free protons are more abundant for @xmath5 and free neutrons are more abundant for @xmath32 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : hight ] ) .    at somewhat lower temperature ( @xmath33 ) , the symmetry of the nse mass fractions across the line of self - conjugacy is broken and only qualitatively discernible . for @xmath34 , free neutrons are less abundant for than are free protons for ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : midt ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the mass fraction of @xmath35 is not symmetric anymore and the abundance peaks of the fe - peak nuclei are wider on the proton - rich side .    at even lower temperature ( @xmath36 ) , the qualitative features of the mass fractions of nuclei in nse as a function of @xmath37 at fixed density and temperature change dramatically in the transition from the neutron - rich to the proton - rich side . for @xmath32 ,",
    "the mass fraction landscape is comprised of a sequence of overlapping abundance peaks ( cf .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "fe - peak nuclei with a proton to nucleon ratio equal or close to the prescribed @xmath37 of the ensemble and a large binding energy per nucleon , @xmath38 , are the most abundant nuclei . for @xmath13 , the picture changes abruptly ( see fig . [",
    "fig : lowt ] ) .",
    "the mass fraction distributions of the fe - peak nuclei are no longer peaked , but rather either slowly rising or falling .",
    "@xmath0 remains the most abundant nuclear species by mass all the way out past @xmath39 .",
    "the mass fraction of free protons continues to rise .",
    "@xmath40 shows a similar trend like @xmath0 , albeit at a smaller abundance level .",
    "there is only a slow rise in the mass fractions of proton - rich fe - peak nuclei for increasing @xmath15 , the abundance peaks for the fe - peak nuclei with a proton to nucleon ratio equal to @xmath37 that are so prominent on the neutron - rich side are absent .",
    "various animations of nse in proton - rich environments may be downloaded from http://cococubed.asu.edu/code_pages/nse.shtml .",
    "in nse , the helmholtz free energy @xmath41 is minimized with respect to the nuclide mass fractions ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . before we discuss and compare the terms that make up @xmath42 for different choices of compositions , it is instructive to review the dependence of @xmath38 on the number of nucleons along an isotopic chain , the attributes of which ultimately are responsible for the lack of symmetry .",
    "@xmath38 on the proton - rich side for the ni isotopic chain decreases rapidly towards proton drip , whereas it gently increases to a maximum at @xmath43 before slowly falling off towards neutron drip ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : be - ni ] ) .",
    "other isotopic chains , such as the one for fe , look qualitatively very similar .",
    "the shape of the @xmath38-curve can be qualitatively understood by considering a simple liquid - drop mass formula taking the volume , surface , asymmetry , and coulomb terms into account @xmath44 for simplicity , we have neglected other terms such as pairing , wigner , or residual interaction .",
    "the derivative with respect to nucleon number is given by @xmath45 the second ( asymmetry ) term is positive on the proton - rich side , zero for @xmath46 , and negative on the neutron - rich side , which gives the @xmath38-curve its general concave up shape .",
    "it is , however , not entirely symmetric about the line @xmath46 .",
    "in fact , since @xmath47 the absolute value of the slope due to the asymmetry term alone is larger on the proton - rich side . the first ( surface ) and third ( coulomb ) term are always positive , both monotonically increasing with @xmath48 , which consequently shifts the most tightly bound isotope to the neutron - rich side and further increases the asymmetry in the slopes on either side of the maximum .",
    "this simple argument shows the essence of how the surface and coulomb terms in the nuclear mass formula leads to a more rapid fall off in @xmath38 on the proton - rich side .",
    "@xmath0 is doubly magic and a wigner @xmath49 nucleus , resulting in an increase in @xmath38 compared to the simple mass formula above and the dominance of @xmath0 in cold , proton - rich nse .      to get a better understanding for the different low temperature behavior of abundance trends as a function of @xmath50 for the proton and neutron - rich regimes , we consider a simplified system and restrict the composition to nuclides from the ni isotopic chain and free nucleons . for a concrete example , let us compare two compositions at @xmath51 , one consisting of pure @xmath52 , and the other consisting of a mix of free protons and a  test \" nucleus , here @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ni55_ni56_p ] ) . the mean binding energy per nucleon",
    "is given by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 the binding energy of nucleus @xmath17 and @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath56 of 28 @xmath52 nuclei is slightly larger than that of 27 @xmath0 nuclei plus 28 protons nse , however , favors the state with the lowest @xmath42 , not the lowest @xmath56 . for @xmath36 and we know that pure @xmath52 is disfavored and should have higher @xmath42 .",
    "this is indeed the case , as @xmath57 between the two states is negligible and the entropy term @xmath58 is much larger for the state with the free protons ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : diff - ni ] ) , resulting in lower @xmath42 .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : ni55_ni56_p ] that with @xmath0 as the test nucleus , the increase in the entropy term on the neutron - rich side for the mixed composition is more than compensated by the increase in binding energy by the pure state . on the other hand , for the proton - rich side",
    "the @xmath56 of both compositions is nearly equal , and the higher entropy of the state with more particles makes the difference .    using the data from the latest atomic mass evaluation of @xcite and an equation of state @xcite , we compute and compare @xmath42 for such compositions for the whole ni isotopic chain , with each isotope as the test nucleus at a time . if @xmath59 of the test nucleus ( in the example above and in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff - ni ] this is @xmath0 ) , we use free neutrons instead of free protons .    for any given @xmath37",
    ", we can derive @xmath56 for a mix of a test nucleus @xmath60 with the appropriate number of free protons or neutrons , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the total binding energy of @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath42 of all such compositions is shown as a function of @xmath15  in fig .",
    "[ fig : ni_fye ] .",
    "it clearly shows that for @xmath63 a pure composition of the ni isotope with @xmath64 has the lowest @xmath42 , and that for @xmath65 a composition consisting of free protons and @xmath0 minimizes @xmath42 .",
    "other choices for the test nucleus have larger @xmath42 ( dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : ni_fye ] ) .",
    "we have presented mass fraction trends for nse in proton - rich environments .",
    "we have explained the , at first sight peculiar , high free proton mass fractions for @xmath66 and large mass fraction of @xmath0 even out to @xmath67 by considering a simplified model . restricting ourselves to the ni isotopic chain",
    ", we have explicitly shown that for @xmath66 @xmath42 is minimized by a state consisting of a mixture of free protons and the self - conjugate @xmath0 , whereas for @xmath68 a state with a pure composition made up of the ni isotope that has @xmath69 closest to the prescribed @xmath50 is preferred . in reality , other isotopic chains are of course accessible .",
    "other fe - peak nuclides ( especially the slightly neutron - rich even isotopes of fe ) compete with ni isotopes for the most tightly bound nucleus with @xmath69 near @xmath50 ( see fig .",
