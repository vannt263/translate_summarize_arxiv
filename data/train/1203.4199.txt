    "establishing the precise mechanism of the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak gauge symmetry is a central focus of the activity in high energy physics and , certainly , one of the primary undertakings of the large hadron collider , the lhc , as well as the tevatron . in the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) is achieved via the brout  englert ",
    "higgs mechanism @xcite , wherein the neutral component of an isodoublet scalar field acquires a non  zero vacuum expectation value .",
    "this gives rise to nonzero masses for the fermions and the electroweak gauge bosons , which are otherwise not allowed by the @xmath0 symmetry . in the sector of the theory with broken symmetry ,",
    "one of the four degrees of freedom of the original isodoublet field , corresponds to a physical particle : the scalar higgs boson with @xmath1 quantum numbers under parity and charge conjugation .",
    "the higgs couplings to the fermions and gauge bosons are related to the masses of these particles and are thus decided by the symmetry breaking mechanism . for detailed reviews of the higgs properties , see refs .",
    "@xcite    in contrast , the mass of the higgs boson itself , although expected to be in the vicinity of the ewsb scale @xmath2 gev , is undetermined . before the start of the lhc , one available direct information on this parameter was the lower limit @xmath3 $ \\sim$}}~}114.4 $ ] gev at 95% confidence level ( cl ) established at lep2 @xcite .",
    "very recently , the tevatron has collected a large data set which allowed the cdf and d0 collaborations to be sensitive to a sm  like higgs particle and , indeed , the mass range between 156 gev and 177 gev has been excluded , again at the 95% cl @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the high accuracy of the electroweak data measured at lep , slc and the tevatron @xcite provides an indirect sensitivity to @xmath4 : the higgs boson contributes logarithmically , @xmath5 , to the radiative corrections to the @xmath6 and @xmath7 boson propagators .",
    "a global fit of the electroweak precision data yields the value @xmath8 gev , corresponding to a 95% cl upper limit of @xmath9 $ \\sim$}}~}161 $ ] gev @xcite .",
    "another analysis , using a different fitting program gives a comparable value @xmath10 gev @xcite .",
    "in both cases , the higgs mass values given above are when the limits from direct searches are not included in the global fits .    from the theoretical side ,",
    "the presence of this new weakly coupled degree of freedom is a crucial ingredient for a unitary electroweak theory .",
    "indeed , the sm without the higgs particle is not self - consistent at high energies as it leads to scattering amplitudes of the massive electroweak gauge bosons that grow with the square of the center of mass energy and perturbative unitarity would be lost at energies above the tev scale .",
    "in fact , even in the presence of a higgs boson , the @xmath6 and @xmath7 bosons could interact very strongly with each other and , imposing the unitarity requirement in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 boson high  energy scattering amplitudes leads to the important higgs mass bound @xmath11 $ \\sim$}}~}700 $ ] gev @xcite , implying that the particle is kinematically accessible at the lhc .",
    "it is interesting to note , as an aside , that just the requirement of perturbative unitarity in these scattering amplitudes leads to a model with exactly the same particle content and couplings as the sm  @xcite .    clearly , the discovery of this last missing piece of the sm is a matter of profound importance .",
    "in fact , in spite of its phenomenal success in explaining the precision data  @xcite , the sm can not be considered to be established completely until the higgs particle is observed experimentally and , further , its fundamental properties such as its mass , spin and other quantum numbers , as well as its couplings to various matter and gauge particles and its self - couplings are established .",
    "these studies are important not only to crown the sm as the correct theory of fundamental particles and interactions among them , but also to achieve further clarity into the dynamics of the ewsb mechanism .",
    "the many important questions which one would like answered are : does the dynamics involve new strong interactions and is the higgs a composite field ?",
    "if elementary higgs particles indeed exist in nature , how many fields are there and in which gauge representations do they appear ? does the ewsb sector involve sizable cp violation ? etc .",
    "theoretical realizations span a wide range of scenarios extending from weak to strong breaking mechanisms , including the so called higgsless theories in extra dimensional models .",
    "as far as the representations of the gauge group are concerned , there is again a whole range starting from models involving light fundamental higgs fields , arising from an su(2 ) doublet , such as in the sm and its supersymmetric extensions which include two  higgs doublets in the minimal version , the mssm , to those containing additional singlet fields or higher representations in extended versions in unified theories and/or alternative theories such as little higgs models .",
    "furthermore , the link between particle physics and cosmology means that the ewsb mechanism can have implications for the generation of the baryon asymmetry in the early universe and could play an important role in the annihilation of the new particles that are responsible for the cosmological dark matter and thus impact their density in the universe today .",
    "an understanding of the ewsb mechanism at a more fundamental level might also hold clues about why the three generations of quarks and leptons have masses which differ from each other ; the so called flavour issue .",
    "a complete discussion of higgs physics thus touches upon almost all the issues under active investigation in theoretical and experimental particle physics .    in this talk",
    ", i will discuss the physics of higgs bosons focusing primarily on theoretical aspects related to searches at the tevatron and the lhc ; the experimental aspects are discussed in the talks of the tevatron and lhc collaborations to the conference @xcite .",
    "i will consider in some details the sm higgs case and only briefly survey the case of the higgs particles of supersymmetric theories .",
    "however , in this case , due to the lack of space / time , i will only discuss the cp conserving mssm ; an account of the phenomenology of the cp  violating mssm , the next  to  mssm as well as other supersymmetric and non  supersymmetric extensions , can be found , for instance , in refs .",
    "more theoretical aspects of ewsb in extensions of the sm have been discussed at this conference by g. bhattachryya @xcite and m. peskin in his summary talk @xcite .",
    "we summarize here the rates for the main higgs production mechanisms at hadron colliders , including the higher order radiative corrections and the associated theoretical uncertainties , as well as the decay and detection channels , focusing on the sm higgs case .",

    "the most important higher order qcd and electroweak corrections , summarized below for each production channel , have been implemented .    the gluon ",
    "gluon fusion process @xmath15 is by far the dominant production channel for sm  like higgs particles at hadron colliders .",
    "the process , which proceeds through triangular heavy quark loops , has been proposed in the late 1970s in ref .",
    "@xcite where the @xmath16 vertex and the production cross section have been derived . in the sm , it is dominantly mediated by the top quark loop contribution , while the bottom quark contribution does not exceed the 10% level at leading order .",
    "this process is known to be subject to extremely large qcd radiative corrections that can be described by an associated @xmath17factor defined as the ratio of the higher order ( ho ) to the lowest order ( lo ) cross sections , consistently evaluated with the value of the strong coupling @xmath18 and the parton distribution functions taken at the considered perturbative order .",
    "the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) corrections in qcd have been calculated in the 1990s .",
    "they are known both for infinite @xcite and finite @xcite loop quark masses and , at the @xmath19 tev lhc , lead to a @xmath17factor @xmath20 in the low higgs mass range , if the central scale of the cross section is chosen to be @xmath4 .",

    "the challenging calculation of the next - to - next - to - leading - order ( nnlo ) contribution has been done @xcite only in the eft approach with @xmath23 and , at @xmath24 tev , it leads to a @xmath25 increase of the cross section , @xmath26 .",
    "the resummation of soft gluons is known up to next - to - next - to - leading - logarithm ( nnll ) and , again , increases the cross section by slightly less than 10% @xcite .",
    "the effects of soft  gluon resumation at nnll can be accounted for in @xmath27 by lowering the central value of the renormalization and factorization scales , from @xmath28 to @xmath29 ; see e.g. ref .",
    "the latter value is chosen for the cross section at nnlo displayed in fig .",
    "[ ppproduct - lhc ] .",
    "note in passing that the choice @xmath30 also improves the convergence of the perturbative series and is more appropriate to describe the kinematics of the process .",
    "some small additional corrections beyond nnlo have been also calculated @xcite .",
    "the electroweak corrections are known both in some approximations @xcite and exactly at nlo @xcite and contribute at the level of a few percent ; there are also small mixed nnlo qcd ",
    "electroweak effects which have been calculated in an effective approach valid for @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the qcd corrections to @xmath32 at @xmath24 tev are smaller than the corresponding ones at the tevatron as the @xmath17factors in this case are @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( with again a central scale equal to @xmath4 ) . in turn , at the lhc with @xmath35 tev , the @xmath17factors are smaller , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the perturbative series shows thus a better ( converging ) behavior at lhc than at tevatron energies .",

    "@xcite for an account .",
    "these calculations are implemented in several programs @xcite which allow to derive the full differential cross section and hence the @xmath38 cross section with cuts .",

    "the higgs ",

    "the vector boson fusion channel , where the higgs is produced in association with two jets , @xmath44 @xcite , is the second most important process at the lhc .",
    "the qcd corrections , which can be obtained in the structure  function approach , are moderate at nlo being at the level of 10% @xcite .",
    "the nnlo corrections which have been calculated recently have been found to be very small @xcite .",
    "the electroweak corrections have been derived in ref .",
    "the corrections including cuts , and in particular corrections to the transverse momentum and rapidity distributions , have also been calculated and implemented into a parton ",
    "level monte ",
    "carlo programs such as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , there is associated higgs production with top quark pairs @xcite which is only relevant at the lhc .",
    "the cross section is rather involved at tree ",
    "level since it is a three  body process , and the calculation of the nlo corrections was a real challenge which was met a few years ago @xcite .",
    "the @xmath17factors turned out to be rather small , @xmath45 and @xmath46 at the lhc with , respectively , @xmath35 tev and 7 tev ( @xmath47 at the tevatron ) if the central scale is chosen to be @xmath48 .",
    "however , the scale dependence is drastically reduced from a factor two at lo to the level of 1020% at nlo .",
    "note that there are also other higgs production processes at hadron colliders but which are of higher perturbative order .",
    "for instance double higgs production , which is sensitive to the higgs self  coupling , can be produced in various processes such as @xmath49 , but with rather low cross sections at the lhc as will be discussed later .",
    "it is well known that the production cross sections at hadron colliders as well as the associated kinematical distributions are generally affected by various theoretical uncertainties . in the case of the gluon ",
    "gluon fusion channel , these theoretical uncertainties turn out to be particularly large .",
    "they are stemming from three main sources .",
    "first , the perturbative qcd corrections to the @xmath32 cross section are so large that one may question the reliability of the perturbative series ( in particular , at the tevatron as discussed above ) and the possibility of still large higher order contributions beyond nnlo can not be excluded .",
    "the effects of the unknown contributions are usually estimated from the variation of the cross section with the renormalisation @xmath50 and factorisation @xmath51 scales at which the process is evaluated .",
    "starting from a median scale taken to be @xmath52 in the @xmath38 process , the current convention is to vary these two scales within the range @xmath53 with the choice @xmath54 .",
    "this leads to a @xmath55 uncertainty at the 7 tev lhc @xcite as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ errors ] ( left ) .",
    "another problem that is specific to the @xmath15 process is that , already at lo , it occurs at the one  loop level with the additional complication of having to account for the finite mass of the loop particle .",
    "this renders the nlo calculation extremely complicated and the nnlo calculation a formidable task .",
    "luckily , one can work in an effective field theory ( eft ) approach in which the heavy loop particles are integrated out , making the calculation of the contributions beyond nlo possible . while this approach is justified for the dominant top quark contribution for @xmath56 $ \\sim$}}~}\\ !",
    "2m_t$ ] @xcite , it is not valid for the @xmath57-quark loop and for those involving the electroweak gauge bosons @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties induced by the use of the eft approach at nnlo are estimated to be of @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "a third problem is due to the presently not satisfactory determination of the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "indeed , in this @xmath59 initiated process , the gluon densities are poorly constrained , in particular in the high bjorken@xmath60 regime ( which is particularly relevant for the tevatron ) .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath61 and receives large contributions at @xmath62 , a small change of @xmath18 leads to a large variation of @xmath63 .",
    "related to that is the significant difference between the world average @xmath18 value and the one from deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) data used in the pdfs @xcite .",
    "there is a statistical method to estimate the pdf uncertainties by allowing a 1@xmath64 ( or more ) excursion of the experimental data that are used to perform the global fits .",
    "in addition , the mstw collaboration @xcite provides a scheme that allows for a combined evaluation of the pdf uncertainties and the ( experimental and theoretical ) ones on @xmath18 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the combined 90% cl pdf+@xmath65 uncertainty on @xmath66 at the 7 tev lhc was found to be of order 10% .",
    "however , this method does not account for the theoretical assumptions that enter into the parametrization of the pdfs ; a way to access this theoretical uncertainty is to compare the results for the central values of the cross section with the best ",
    "fit pdfs when using different parameterizations @xcite as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ errors ] .",
    "an important issue is the way these various uncertainties should be combined . as advocated in refs .",
    "@xcite , one should be conservative and add all these uncertainties linearly ( this is equivalent of assuming that the pdf uncertainty is a pure theoretical uncertainty with a flat prior ) . in the mass range below @xmath9 $ \\sim$}}~}200 $ ] gev , this would lead to an uncertainty of about 2025% on @xmath67 as exemplified in the left - hand side of fig .",
    "[ errors - all ] .    in the case of the three other higgs production channels , because the qcd corrections are moderate , the theoretical uncertainties are much smaller : at the lhc with @xmath24 tev , they are at level of @xmath68 for the higgs  strahlung and vector boson fusion processes and @xmath69 in the case of @xmath70 production as exemplified in the right  hand side of fig .",
    "[ errors - all ] .",
    "note that at the tevatron where the qcd corrections in the @xmath15 process are larger than at the lhc , it is wise to extend the domain of scale variation and adopt instead a value @xmath71 .",
    "this is the choice made in ref .",
    "@xcite which resulted in a @xmath72 scale uncertainty .",
    "in addition , because one is in a higher borjken@xmath60 region at the tevatron , the gluon density is less constrained and the pdf uncertainty is also larger than at the lhc . the total theoretical uncertainty on @xmath73 at the tevatron is estimated to be twice as large as at the lhc @xcite .",
    "in turn , for the higgs  strahlung process , it is of @xmath58 only .",
    "once its mass is fixed the profile of the higgs particle is uniquely determined and its production rates and decay widths are fixed . as its couplings to different particles are proportional to their masses , the higgs boson will have the tendency to decay into the heaviest particles allowed by phase space .",
    "the higgs decay modes and their branching ratios are briefly summarized below .    in the  low  mass",
    "\" range , @xmath9 $ \\sim$}}~}130 $ ] gev , the higgs boson decays into a large variety of channels .",
    "the main mode is by far the decay into @xmath74 with a @xmath75 6090% probability followed by the decays into @xmath76 and @xmath77 with @xmath75 5% branching ratios . also of significance",
    "is the top ",
    "loop mediated decay into gluons , which occurs at the level of @xmath75 5% .",
    "the top and @xmath6loop mediated @xmath78 and @xmath79 decay modes , which lead to clear signals , are very rare with rates of @xmath80 .",

    "body @xmath82 mode : the much larger @xmath83 coupling compared to @xmath84 compensates for the suppression by the additional electroweak coupling and the virtuality of the @xmath6 boson .    in the  high  mass",

    "the branching ratios are 2/3 for @xmath85 and 1/3 for @xmath86 decays , and the opening of the @xmath87 channel for higher @xmath4 does not alter this pattern significantly .    in the low  mass range , the higgs is very narrow , with @xmath88 mev , but this width increases , reaching 1 gev at the @xmath86 threshold . for very large masses ,",
    "the higgs becomes obese , since @xmath89 , and can hardly be considered as a resonance .",
    "the branching ratios and total decay widths are summarized in fig .",
    "[ hfig : brwidsm ] , which is obtained from a recently updated version of the fortran code hdecay @xcite which includes all relevant channels with the important radiative corrections and other higher order effects @xcite .",
    "in addition , the theoretical uncertainties on the higgs branching ratios should also be considered .",
    "indeed , while the higgs decays into lepton and gauge boson pairs are well under control ( as mainly small electroweak effects are involved ) , the partial decays widths into quark pairs and gluons are plagued with uncertainties that are mainly due to the imperfect knowledge of the bottom and charm quark masses and the value of the strong coupling constant @xmath18 . at least in the intermediate mass range , @xmath90150 gev where the sm higgs decay rates into @xmath91 and @xmath92 final states have the same order of magnitude , the parametric uncertainties on these two main higgs decay branching ratios are non  negligible , being of the order of 3 to 10% @xcite",
    ".    ll        &          from the previous discussion , one concludes that producing the sm higgs particle is relatively easy ; this is particularly the case at the lhc thanks to the high energy of the collider and its expected luminosity .",
    "however , detecting the particle in a very complex hadronic environment is another story . indeed , in the main higgs decay channels the backgrounds are simply gigantic @xcite .",
    "for instance , the rate for the production of light quarks and gluons is ten orders of magnitude larger than that of the higgs boson .",
    "even the cross sections for the production of @xmath6 and @xmath7 bosons are three to four orders of magnitude larger .",
    "detecting the higgs particle is this hostile environment resembles to finding a needle in a ( million ) haystack , the challenges to be met being simply enormous .    to be able to detect the higgs particle",
    ", one should take advantage in an optimal manner of the kinematical characteristics of the signal events which are , in general , quite different from that of the background events .",
    "in addition , one should focus on the decay modes of the higgs particles ( and those of the particles that are produced in association such as @xmath93 bosons or top quarks ) that are easier to extract from the background events .",
    "pure hadronic modes such as higgs decays into light quark or gluon jets have to be discarded although much more frequent in most cases .",
