    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is believed to be the most promising candidate for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . among many attractive features",
    ", supersymmetry can provide understanding for the mass hierarchy of the weak scale and the planck scale .",
    "the existence of the susy particles ( sparticles ) at the weak scale can satisfactorily lead to the gauge coupling unification at a desirable scale .",
    "the electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered radiatively by the large top - quark mass .",
    "the weak - scale susy also necessarily leads to rich physics in the near - future collider experiments @xcite .",
    "however , current supersymmetric models do not advance our knowledge of flavor physics beyond the sm , such as the fermion mass generation and quark / lepton mixings .",
    "in fact , generic susy models often have arbitrary flavor mixings and mass parameters in the scalar quark ( squark ) and scalar lepton ( slepton ) sectors and one would have to assume certain symmetries to prevent large flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the flavor structure in the susy sector motivates us to seek for new physics , and any experimental observation on the fcnc processes beyond the sm would undoubtedly shed light on our understanding for flavor physics . the evidence of neutrino oscillations observed by the super - kamiokande experiments serves as a good example @xcite .    besides the conventional studies for fcnc effects in susy grand unification models in processes @xmath4 @xcite , neutral meson oscillations @xcite , and @xmath5 @xcite at low energies",
    ", it has been actively pursued to explore the possible signatures at future collider experiments for the lepton - flavor violating processes in susy theories .",
    "due to the super - gim mechanism , it has been pointed out @xcite that for low - energy rare processes induced by sparticle loops , the rates are suppressed by @xmath6 ; while for the flavor changing signal from direct slepton production at high energy colliders the suppression factor is at most @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the sfermion mass and decay width .",
    "it is found that there is great physics potential for the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) and the next @xmath10 linear collider ( nlc ) to probe susy flavor physics through slepton oscillations @xcite .",
    "in contrast , there are several advantages for considering an @xmath11 collider to study susy flavor physics .",
    "first of all , lepton and electron - photon colliders often provide much cleaner experimental environment for new physics searches than hadron colliders .",
    "second , in models with soft mass unification or with ( minimal ) gauge - mediation of susy breaking , the lightest neutralino ( @xmath12 ) is expected to be lighter than sleptons ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "therefore , the sparticle production for @xmath14 would have lower mass threshold @xcite than those for @xmath15 .",
    "third , even when slepton pair production is kinematically allowed there is a @xmath16-wave ( @xmath17 ) suppression of the cross section near threshold , and the event rates are correspondingly limited .",
    "on the other hand , the cross sections for @xmath18 production are proportional to @xmath19 near threshold , so high production rates are achievable .",
    "fourth , since there exists the net electron flavor in the initial state , the observation on a lepton flavor other than an electron in the final state could be a clear signature for the flavor oscillation , with less severe sm backgrounds .    in this paper , we study the signals for slepton oscillation between the first generation and the other two generations at an @xmath20 collider and their sm backgrounds .",
    "we consider an @xmath1 collider with 500 gev c.  m.  energy and an annual luminosity 50 fb@xmath21 @xcite , running at the @xmath20 mode @xcite . in section",
    "ii , we first illustrate the general flavor mixing in the slepton sector for the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . we then present the slepton production mechanisms and cross sections with and without the flavor mixing . in section iii ,",
    "we study the slepton oscillation signals and their sm backgrounds at an @xmath20 collider .",
    "we find that for the gaugino - like neutralino and chargino , it is promising to probe the mass differences and mixing angles between the left - handed sleptons to good precision .",
    "for the right - handed slepton sector , the results are comparable to the existing one at @xmath1 and @xmath2 linear colliders @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity obtained here is better than the most stringent low - energy constraints for lepton - flavor violation from @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "we summarize our results in sec .",
    "the mass terms for the left - handed sleptons ( partners to the left - handed leptons ) , right - handed sleptons and left - handed sneutrinos can be generally written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 are the generation indices , and @xmath25 are mass matrices which can be diagonalized through the unitary matrices @xmath26 . in terms of the slepton",
    "mass eigenstates , the lepton - slepton interactions with gauginos are flavor non - diagonal : @xmath27 which generally leads to lepton - flavor violating effects .",
    "if the slepton mass differences are large and the lepton - flavor off - diagonal couplings ( @xmath28 ) are sizeable , eq .  ( [ fcnc ] ) may directly lead to flavor - changing processes like @xmath29 where the flavor index @xmath30 , as depicted in fig .",
    "1(a ) and ( b ) , in which the black dots denote the vertices with flavor changing interactions . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) is nearly degenerate with other sleptons ( sneutrinos ) , as prefered by suppressing the fcnc and as constrained by @xmath22 data , then the processes ( [ process ] ) and ( [ process1 ] ) may mainly go through the flavor diagonal production @xmath33 followed by @xmath34 oscillation subsequently @xcite .",
    "the two cross sections are then related by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the transition probability of interaction eigenstates @xmath31 to @xmath37 via oscillation , and @xmath38 and @xmath39 the mixing angle between @xmath31 and @xmath37 .",
    "the cross section formula for sneutrino oscillation is the same as eq .",
    "( [ osci ] ) with the replacement of @xmath40 .    for the flavor diagonal production of @xmath41 , the differential cross section summed over the chargino helicity",

    "the angle @xmath45 specifies the chargino momentum relative to the incoming direction in the c.m .",
    "frame , @xmath46 is the chargino velocity in the c.m .",
    "frame , and @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath48 helicity amplitude is @xmath49-wave near threshold so the cross section of eq .",
    "( [ nu1 ] ) is proportional to @xmath50 ; the @xmath51 helicity amplitude , which comes only from the @xmath52-channel diagram , is @xmath16-wave near threshold so the cross section of eq .",
    "( [ nu2 ] ) goes like @xmath17 .",
    "the scattering amplitude is proportional to the wino fractions @xmath53 of the matrix @xmath54 that diagonalizes the mass matrix ( the first index @xmath55 labels the chargino mass eigenstate @xmath56 and the second index @xmath57 refers to the primordial gaugino and higgsino basis @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) .",
    "further , the @xmath60 state fixes the incoming electron chirality to be left - handed `` @xmath61 '' .",

    "1(b ) with @xmath64 . by eq .  ( [ osci ] )",

    "the contributions from higgsino components ( @xmath66 ) of @xmath67 can be neglected and only the neutralino mixing elements @xmath68 and @xmath69 enter . after summing over the neutralino helicities , there are four independent helicity cross sections as the helicity of the @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) matches that of the @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) : @xmath74 the @xmath75 @xmath76 for @xmath71 @xmath77 are effective couplings given by @xmath78 , \\quad f_{ir } = \\frac{-z_{i1}^{*}}{\\cos\\theta_w}. \\label{lrcouplings}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the @xmath79 are the elements of matrices that diagonalize the neutralino mass matrix ( the first index @xmath55 labels the neutralino mass eigenstate @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and the second index @xmath82 refers to the primordial gaugino and higgsino basis ( @xmath83 ) ) .",
    "the angle @xmath84 specifies the direction of the selectron with respect to the direction of the incoming electron in the c.m.frame , @xmath19 is the velocity of the selectron , and @xmath85 .    due to the approximate decoupling of higgsinos from the electron ,",
    "the cross sections for the processes ( [ process ] ) and ( [ process1 ] ) are only large when the charginos and neutralinos are mainly gaugino - like , namely @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "fortunately gaugino - like @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are highly favored theoretically for two reasons : ( _ i _ ) the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking in susy guts theories yields a large @xmath91 value if @xmath92 is bounded by the infrared fixed point solutions for the top quark yukawa coupling @xcite ; ( _ ii _ ) @xmath93 is strongly preferred for @xmath94 to be a viable cold dark matter candidate @xcite . in the rest of our paper",
    ", we will thus concentrate on this scenario . for our illustrations",
    "we choose the chargino / neutralino masses ( in gev ) @xmath95 and the mixing matrix elements @xmath96 for the neutralinos and @xmath97 for the chargino .",
    "these parameters correspond to the following mssm parameters at the weak scale @xmath98 where @xmath92 is a little larger than that at the infrared fixed point value@xcite to get a heavier higgs mass to avoid the lep2 limit and the convention for sign@xmath99 follows ref .",
    "@xcite . for slepton masses ,",
    "we choose ( in gev ) @xmath100 our choices for the gaugino and slepton masses are consistent with renormalization group evolution @xcite to the electroweak scale , with the following universal msugra parameters @xmath101    from eqs .",
    "( [ nu1][neuthel2 ] ) , we see the following features : due to the stronger diagonal couplings @xmath102 , the cross sections for @xmath103 ( mainly @xmath104 ) and @xmath105 ( mainly @xmath106 ) are significantly larger than the other selectron channels ; the weaker neutral current couplings and the more massive scalar propagator in selectron production make their cross sections smaller than those for sneutrino production .",
    "we illustrate these features in four processes with larger cross sections in fig .  2 .",
    "two non - zero @xmath107 helicity combinations are labeled in parentheses .",
    "the solid curves are of @xmath49-wave near the threshold resulting in a higher cross section rate , and the dashed ones of @xmath16-wave .",
    "this indicates the possible signal enrichment by properly choosing the helicity configuration for the beams .",
    "the lower curves show the effects of convolution with the backscattered laser photon spectrum for the machine parameters as chosen in refs .",
    "the effect is to decrease the cross sections by about a factor of two . at an nlc with c.  m.  energy 500 gev ,",
    "the typical production sections are of order 1000 fb for @xmath108 , and about 100 fb for @xmath109 and @xmath105 , on which three channels we will focus for our phenomenology study in the next section .",
    ".[br - bf ] sparticle decay modes and branching fractions for the representative parameter choice . here",
    "@xmath110 generically denotes a quark and @xmath111 denotes a lepton ; fermion - antifermion pairs @xmath112 with net charge @xmath113 are denoted by @xmath114 [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     generally speaking , due to the distinctive kinematical characteristics , the multiple - jet ( @xmath115 ) signals for @xmath116 and @xmath117 have favorable signal - to - background ratios .",
    "the irreducible sm background processes are @xmath118 including the hadronic decay branching fractions of @xmath119 decays , we find that the cross sections of eq .",
    "( [ back ] ) are less than 0.1 fb at @xmath120 500 gev .",
    "we could therefore expect a very effective probe to the oscillation parameters for processes ( [ channel1 ] ) and ( [ channel2 ] ) .",
    "however , the leading background to the @xmath121 signal of eq .",
    "( [ channel3 ] ) is @xmath122 the total cross section for this process at @xmath120 500 gev is about two picobarns , and the oscillation signal would be swamped by it . on the other hand , this signal process involves a right - handed electron in the initial state while the background process involves only a left - handed one due to the @xmath123 exchange .",
    "if high beam polarization @xmath124 can be implemented @xcite , then this sm background can be highly suppressed .",
    "helicity argument shows that choosing the right - handed photon beam could also help further suppress the background survived from the impure @xmath125 reaction , without hurting the signal [ see fig .",
    "we thus assume that the background eq .",
    "( [ big ] ) can been reduced to a manageable level . in our subsequent numerical discussions , based on the signal branching ratios in table  ii",
    ", we estimate the signal efficiencies to be 40% , 15% and 80% for eqs .",
    "( [ channel1 ] ) , ( [ channel2 ] ) and ( [ channel3 ] ) , respectively .",
    "we consider an oscillation signal to be observable if the cross section after the inclusion of the efficiencies to be no less than 0.1 fb .",
    "for instance , a 0.1 fb signal cross section and negligible backgrounds with a 50 fb@xmath21 luminosity would correspond to about 99% c.l . discovery .    in figs .  3 , 4 and 5 , we illustrate contours of constant cross sections for signal processes in ( [ channel1 ] ) , ( [ channel2 ] ) and ( [ channel3 ] ) , respectively , in @xmath126 plane . when plotting each figure , we assume that just one mixing angle exits , _",
    "i.e. _ , the contributions originating from other mixing angles are set to zero .",
    "the ( thick ) solid curves in the figures present the constant cross section contours for @xmath127 and 1 fb .",
    "the dashed lines correspond to the current bound on the branching fraction @xmath128 . a lower value of @xmath129 is also indicated by the ( thin ) solid line .",
    "those curves are obtained with the susy parameters presented in the previous section . as showed in figs . 3 and 4 , achievable sensitivity in @xmath130 for the left - handed slepton sector",
    "can be significantly better than the low - energy constraint from @xmath22 .",
    "it is even more impressive to probe the oscillation parameters in the right - handed slepton sector if the beam polarizations can be implemented to suppress the backgrounds .",
    "compared with the resultes at @xmath1 and @xmath2 colliders @xcite , the potential of probing mixing angle @xmath131 between @xmath132 and @xmath133 are comparable .",
    "so far , we have only discussed the slepton oscillations between electron and muon flavors .",
    "our analyses are essentially applicable for @xmath134 oscillation as well .",
    "in fact , our calculations for the signal by eqs .",
    "( [ osci])([neuthel2 ] ) and the backgrounds of eqs .",
    "( [ back])-([big ] ) should be formally identical for the @xmath135 final state .",
    "the only differences are : theoretically , the mass difference between @xmath136 and @xmath137 may be bigger than that of @xmath136 and @xmath138 due to the larger yukawa coupling running for @xmath137 .",
    "experimentally , the @xmath135 lepton tagging is less efficient than that for @xmath139 .",
    "this may lead to about a 80% reduction on the event rate .",
    "nevertheless , we expect about same order of magnitude sensitivity for @xmath134 oscillation . due to the electron flavor in the initial state ,",
    "the signal processes under discussion are not sensitive to the @xmath140 oscillation .",
    "recent study @xcite showed that an @xmath1 collider could probe this oscillation to high precision .",
    "we only considered a representative set of susy parameters . as long as the lighter neutralino and chargino are gaugino - like",
    "as anticipated in msugra models and in the minimal gauge - mediated susy breaking model , our results should be generally valid .",
    "we presented our study with the slepton masses approximately 270 gev .",
    "this has been beyond the reach for an nlc with @xmath141 gev via @xmath15 . for a heavier slepton spectrum",
    ", we would need a collider with a higher c.  m.  energy .",
    "the current discussions on the linear collider parameters @xcite indicate the feasibility to extend the c.  m.  energy to 1.5 tev .",
    "it is always most beneficial that the c. m. energy is just above the signal production threshold .",
    "however , if the neutralino and chargino are higgsino - like , then their couplings to leptons are too weak to result in significant cross sections for the signal at an @xmath20 collider .    in summary , we have demonstrated that for gaugino - like neutralino and chargino , the slepton oscillation effects may be observable at a 500 gev @xmath20 collider with a 50 fb@xmath21 luminosity .",
    "the achievable sensitivity in @xmath130 for the left - handed slepton sector can be significantly better than the low - energy constraint from @xmath22 . in the right - handed slepton sector ,",
    "our results are comparable to that for @xmath1 and @xmath2 colliders , if the beam polarizations ( @xmath142 and @xmath143 ) can be implemented to suppress the backgrounds",
    ". it may even be possible for an @xmath20 collider to go beyond the probe at an @xmath1 collider because of the kinematics advantage .",
    "our analyses are essentially applicable for @xmath134 oscillation , with a sensitivity of the same order of magnitude as that for @xmath144 .",
