    "random matrix theory has been widely used to model the behavior of complex quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "of particular importance are two - body random matrix ensembles ( tbre ) , which were introduced into nuclear physics three decades ago  @xcite and recently have received a considerable amount of renewed interest in the study of mesoscopic systems  @xcite and nuclei  @xcite .",
    "this is partly due to the observation of regular structures in the low - lying states of various nuclear models with random two - body interactions . as examples we mention the observed ground state dominance of @xmath0 states , the occurrence of pairing ( energy ) gaps in random shell models  @xcite , and the existence of vibrational and rotational bands in random interacting boson models  @xcite . while these observations concern the low - lying levels of many - body systems , similar regularities also",
    "have been reported in the wave function structure .",
    "these include signatures of phonon collectivity relating states of different angular momentum  @xcite , strong pair - transfer amplitudes between ground states of nuclei with different mass numbers  @xcite , strong electromagnetic transitions in bands of random interacting boson models  @xcite , deviations from random matrix theory in transition strength distributions for embedded gaussian ensembles  @xcite , and regularities in wave functions of spin systems with random interactions  @xcite .",
    "these observations indicate that some typical properties of interacting many - body systems are determined simply by the presence of a rotationally invariant two - body force that allows for transitions between single - particle fock space states .",
    "in this article we aim at an understanding of some of the reported regularities .",
    "we are particularly interested in the quantum numbers of the ground state and in correlations between energies and wave functions of low - lying states . for this purpose",
    "we consider a system of @xmath1 spin-@xmath2 fermions on @xmath3 orbitals , subject to a spin - conserving random two - body interaction .",
    "this system is simpler than the nuclear models studied so far , and allows us to derive analytical results .",
    "it may be seen as a model for mesoscopic systems like quantum dots .",
    "this article is divided as follows . in the following section we focus on the width and shape of spectral densities in sectors of definite spin for two models of spin systems with random interactions , and derive analytical results .",
    "special emphasis is placed on understanding the spin structure of the spectrum close to the ground state .",
    "our analysis extends and complements previous work in nuclei  @xcite and mesoscopic systems  @xcite . in section  [ seccorrelpairing ] we investigate correlations between low - lying states , and consider pairing properties . finally we give a summary .",
    "we begin with a very simple model of random spin - conserving two - body interactions in a many - body system  @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 each denotes a pair of two spin@xmath7 fermions in a @xmath8 state , while @xmath9 and @xmath10 each denotes a pair of fermions in a @xmath11 state .",
    "the two - body states can of course be labeled by the individual orbitals occupied by the two particles .",
    "thus , for a system with @xmath3 single - particle orbitals , we have @xmath12 pairs with total spin @xmath11 , enumerated as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 annihilates a single particle state , and the single - particle indices are @xmath15 . [ here we are enumerating two - body @xmath11 states with @xmath16 only ; obviously there are equal numbers of @xmath17 two - body states which by rotational symmetry must couple in precisely the same way . ]",
    "similarly , there are @xmath12 pairs with total spin @xmath8 , having the form @xmath18 , and an additional @xmath3 pairs where a single site is doubly occupied : @xmath19",
    ". we will assume throughout that the two kinds of @xmath8 states interact equally strongly among themselves and with each other ; this assumption does not substantially affect any of the results to be presented in this paper .",
    "the effect of diagonal spin - spin interactions in a spin system with random wave functions has been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite .    within each two - body spin sector ,",
    "then , the couplings @xmath20 and @xmath21 are assumed to be governed by a goe random - matrix ensemble , @xmath22 where @xmath23 indicates an ensemble average . we note that the two matrices @xmath20 and @xmath24 are each taken to be real and symmetric , consistent with time reversal invariance ; the model can easily be generalized to the case where an external magnetic field is present , so that the matrices must be taken from a gue rather than a goe ensemble , or from an intermediate ensemble  @xcite .",
    "finally , we notice that in the model ( eq .  [ twobodyham ] ) , couplings in different two - body spin sectors are taken to be completely independent of one another ; in section  [ secvijkl ] we will discuss an alternative random - coupling model where this is not the case . in section  [ seccorrelpairing ] we will see what effects on spin spectra may be obtained by adding a one - body term to the two - body random hamiltonian .",
    "note that the presence of a strong one - body term enhances the likelyhood of finding a spin-0 ground state , due to spin - degeneracy of the one - body spectrum .",
    "we may now consider numerically the spectra of @xmath25fermion systems interacting via the random two - body interaction of the form ( eq .",
    "[ twobodyham ] ) . due to an approximate particle - hole symmetry of this system",
    ", maximum density is obtained near half - filling , @xmath26 , and we may restrict ourselves to the parameter range @xmath27 . the preponderance of @xmath28 many - body ground states , which has been observed previously in shell model calculations , is seen to be an extremely strong effect in this simple random interaction model . for @xmath29 fermions on @xmath30 sites , with an exclusively spin-@xmath31 interaction ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) , we find for an ensemble of @xmath34 systems that the ground state has total spin @xmath28 in @xmath35 of the cases . for an exclusively spin-@xmath36 interaction ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) , the ground state",
    "is observed to have total spin @xmath28 for @xmath39 of the systems in the ensemble ( a result which is statistically indistinguishable from the previous case ) .",
    "this is despite the fact that in this system @xmath28 many - body states comprise only about @xmath40 of the total number of states . for @xmath29 particles on @xmath41 sites ,",
    "all @xmath34 computed ground states were observed to have total spin @xmath28 , independent of whether a pure @xmath8 or @xmath11 two - body coupling was used .",
    "very similar results are obtained at least until a system size of @xmath42 , beyond which point the size of the many - body basis makes the diagonalization of a large ensemble of hamiltonians prohibitively expensive . for @xmath43 particles on @xmath44 @xmath45 and @xmath46 sites",
    ", we once again observe an almost @xmath47 prevalence of @xmath28 ground states .",
    "how may we understand these initially surprising findings within the context of a completely random interaction model ?",
    "we begin by considering the shape of the many - body density of states @xmath48 in sectors of total many - body spin @xmath49 .",
    "it is known that for @xmath50 particles with a two - body interaction , the moments of the spectral density move away from those associated with a semicircle law , and approach those corresponding to a gaussian shape  @xcite .",
    "then , the ensemble - averaged spectra @xmath51 , being centered at @xmath52 because of the symmetry of the hamiltonian , must be described simply by their squared widths , @xmath53 ( where @xmath54 denotes throughout the sum over all basis states in the sector of total spin @xmath49 , divided by the number of basis states in that sector ) .",
    "our naive expectation ( assuming that the spectrum can be described by a gaussian shape well into its tail ) is that ground state behavior should be associated with the relative widths of the different spin spectra , a preponderance of @xmath28 ground states arising from a large value of @xmath55 as compared to widths in the other sectors  @xcite . indeed , fixing the number of particles at @xmath29 ,",
    "our numerical results show that for @xmath56 orbitals the relation @xmath57 is almost always observed ( independent of the relative values of @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) , consistent with @xmath28 ground state dominance . for @xmath60 and @xmath61 , however , when taking an exclusively @xmath11 coupling , this pattern is reversed , with the widths of the higher - spin spectra beginning to exceed those of the @xmath28 spectrum .",
    "this shows that the width analysis alone is not sufficient to explain numerical results for the ground state behavior .",
    "however , these findings do suggest than an interesting transition may be taking place as we approach the dilute regime , which we shall now proceed to understand analytically .      the many - body basis states of the system may be classified by the total spin @xmath49 and the number @xmath62 of orbitals that are doubly occupied , @xmath63 .",
    "we easily see that in the dilute limit ( @xmath64 for fixed @xmath1 ) , @xmath65 states will dominate : a typical @xmath28 or @xmath66 basis state in this limit is given for even @xmath1 by @xmath67 where the plus ( minus ) sign produces an @xmath66 ( @xmath28 ) @xmath25body state , the single - particle orbitals @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 ,  , @xmath72 , @xmath73",
    "are all taken to be distinct , and @xmath74 denotes the vacuum . however , at finite densities we must consider basis states in subsectors of different @xmath62 for any given value of @xmath49 , as these might in general have spectra of different shape and width .",
    "it is a straightforward , though somewhat tedious , counting problem to compute the ensemble - averaged squared energy width @xmath75 , for a typical basis state @xmath76 of given quantum numbers @xmath49 and @xmath62 , when acted on by the hamiltonian ( eq .  [ twobodyham ] ) .",
    "for each two - particle pair @xmath6 or @xmath10 of the appropriate spin that may be annihilated , one simply has to count contributions from all pairs @xmath5 or @xmath9 that may be created in its place , while keeping track of terms that must be added up coherently .",
    "so , for example , for a pure @xmath8 coupling ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) , one obtains @xmath77\\over 16 } + { n \\over 2 } \\nonumber \\\\ { \\rm tr}_1 h^2 & = & { \\rm tr}_0 h^2 - { 2m^2 - 2mn+n^2 \\over 4 } \\nonumber \\\\ & - & { 3m - n \\over 2}-1 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in eq .  [ j0gen ] , terms are grouped and ordered by decreasing power in the number of orbitals @xmath3 assuming finite density ( @xmath78 ) . in particular , we notice that the leading @xmath79 term is invariant under particle - hole symmetry , @xmath80 .",
    "this symmetry is broken at @xmath81 because of new terms that arise in the hamiltonian ( eq .  [ twobodyham ] ) when one commutes annihilation operators @xmath82 and creation operators @xmath83 corresponding to pairs having at least one orbital in common .",
    "we notice also that the effect of double degeneracy ( @xmath84 ) is initially to increase the width slightly , and then restore it to the original value when @xmath62 reaches its maximal value of @xmath85 .",
    "however , the effect of double degeneracy appears only at @xmath86 , which we will see below to be small compared with the level spacing near the ground state , in the many - body limit .",
    "thus , even for a non - dilute system ( @xmath78 ) , we are justified in studying the spectra of @xmath65 states and taking their widths as proxies for the entire spectrum of that spin , even for the purpose of determining behavior near the edge of the spectrum ( where the level spacings are largest ) . in section  [ secpairing ]",
    "we will consider the possible relevance of @xmath84 contributions to wave function structure near the ground state .",
    "we find there that basis states with high ( or low ) double occupancy have almost equal overlaps with eigenstates of all energies , and have no special tendency to contribute to the low - lying part of the spectrum .",
    "thus it appears that , to leading order , double occupancy effects are not important to understanding the spin structure of the spectrum for a pure two - body interaction .",
    "the width expression of eq .",
    "[ j0gen ] is rather unwieldy , as it consists of @xmath87 monomial terms , and so we begin our detailed analysis with the special case of @xmath29 particles ; as we shall see below , all the interesting qualitative behavior of the many - body system is already present in this simple case . in the @xmath28 sector",
    "we have @xmath88 independent basis states of type @xmath65 , having the form @xmath89 ( where @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 all represent different orbitals ) , @xmath92 basis states of type @xmath93 , and @xmath94 basis states of type @xmath95 .",
    "similarly , in the @xmath66 sector we have @xmath96 independent basis states of type @xmath65 , of the form @xmath97 and @xmath92 basis states of type @xmath93 .",
    "finally , in the @xmath98 sector we only have the @xmath99 basis states of type @xmath65 .",
    "as the system becomes dilute ( @xmath64 ) , type @xmath65 states always dominate , and the total numbers of states in the spin @xmath31 , @xmath36 , and @xmath100 sectors approach the ratio @xmath101 .",
    "[ as we mentioned above , even for finite @xmath3 , the inclusion of @xmath84 states does not significantly affect the behavior of the spin spectra , leading to corrections that are small compared with the level spacing . ]",
    "what then causes the preponderance of @xmath28 ground states in this system ? using @xmath65 basis states , one obtains the following expressions for the widths ( of course the @xmath102 part of these results is merely a special case of eq .",
    "[ j0gen ] ) : @xmath103 the leading @xmath104 terms in the above expressions are easiest to understand .",
    "we simply need to take the number of spin-@xmath105 pairs in a four - body state of total spin @xmath49 ( eq .",
    "[ type0c ] or eq .",
    "[ type1c ] ) , and multiply by the number of orbital pairs to which the two particles may jump ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "so , for example , in a state of total spin @xmath28 ( eq .  [ type0c ] ) , the @xmath107 and @xmath108 pairs are in pure @xmath8 combinations , while the remaining @xmath109 pairs are uncorrelated , i.e. @xmath110 of them have @xmath8 and @xmath111 have @xmath11 .",
    "this leads to a total of @xmath112 pairs each of @xmath8 and @xmath11 , explaining the two @xmath113 terms in the first line of eq .",
    "[ traces4 ] . in a state of total spin @xmath66 ( eq .",
    "[ type1c ] ) , the only difference is that the @xmath107 pair is now in a @xmath11 combination , so there are only @xmath100 pairs with @xmath8 and @xmath109 pairs with @xmath11 , leading to the @xmath114 and @xmath115 terms in the second line of eq .",
    "[ traces4 ] .",
    "we see already from this very simple argument that , due to a relatively larger number of @xmath8 pairs in a spin-@xmath31 state and a relatively larger number of @xmath11 pairs in a spin-@xmath36 state , in the @xmath64 limit we always have @xmath116 if @xmath117 and @xmath118 if @xmath119 .",
    "the ratio of the widths in the dilute limit approaches a constant , @xmath120 while the ratio of the many - body level spacing near the ground state , @xmath121 , to the width and thus to the width difference is becoming small .",
    "because the spectral shapes @xmath122 approach a gaussian form in the @xmath123 limit , we expect this width difference to dominate the ground - state behavior , and to see @xmath47 @xmath28 ground states for a strong @xmath58 coupling , and @xmath124 for a stronger @xmath59 coupling .",
    "the @xmath64 behavior for @xmath125 is more subtle and requires an analysis of the subleading @xmath126 terms in eq .",
    "[ traces4 ] . to compute these we need to count more carefully the number of places @xmath5 or @xmath9 to which the two interacting particles may jump ,",
    "given that two of the orbitals remain occupied by the two ` bystanders ' during the interaction .",
    "in the case of a @xmath11 pair , we also need to treat correctly the interference between @xmath127 terms .",
    "the end result is that overall , after adding together @xmath8 and @xmath11 couplings , the @xmath66 width is suppressed at @xmath126 compared with the @xmath28 width , as a simple physical argument shows . in eq .",
    "[ type0c ] , the @xmath128 pair ( or any one of the other @xmath112 analogous pairs ) may interact either in a @xmath8 or @xmath11 combination , with the final state leaving @xmath69 doubled up with @xmath68 and with @xmath90 ending up on any of the remaining @xmath129 sites . for an initial state of the form eq .",
    "[ type1c ] , this process is not allowed ( since the @xmath107 pair start out in a spin - symmetric combination and can not end up occupying the same orbital ) , so @xmath130 is reduced at the @xmath126 level .",
    "thus , in the large-@xmath3 limit for @xmath125 , we obtain @xmath131 by itself , however , this width difference should not be sufficient to determine the ground state behavior .",
    "that is because for a gaussian spectral density with @xmath132 states the location of the ground state scales as @xmath133 , while the level spacing near the ground state goes as @xmath134 .",
    "so the ratio of the expected difference ( gap ) between the lowest @xmath28 and @xmath66 states to the level spacing scales as @xmath135 and thus in a model of random uncorrelated fluctuations under the two gaussian spectral envelopes @xmath136 and @xmath137 , we would expect no preference for either @xmath28 or @xmath66 ground states ( i.e. the ratio of @xmath28 to @xmath66 ground states should approach the @xmath138 ratio valid for the _ total _ density of states ) .",
    "we note , however , that in our numerical simulations , the ground state always comes out to have spin @xmath28 , even for the highest values of @xmath3 ( @xmath42 ) that we can achieve , where the width difference is very small . indeed ,",
    "as we saw above in section  [ secwidth ] , @xmath28 ground states can dominate even when the width difference changes sign , as happens for a pure spin-@xmath36 two - body coupling ( @xmath38 ) . a major reason for this we believe to be strong deviations from the gaussian shape of a four - particle spectrum ( though correlations between @xmath136 and @xmath137 may also be relevant ; we will discuss these correlations in more detail in section  [ correls ] ) .",
    "we recall that the approach of an @xmath25body spectrum to a gaussian shape given only two - body interactions depends crucially on the assumption that repeated applications of the hamiltonian act on different pairs of particles and therefore may be taken to commute with each other .",
    "so , for example , @xmath139 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 label two - body states ( either @xmath8 or @xmath11 ) , as in eq .",
    "[ twobodyham ] , and are summed over .",
    "notice that the third term contributes in general only if the two transitions involve distinct pairs of interacting particles .",
    "otherwise ( e.g. , for a generic sparse matrix with no two - body interaction structure ) , we would obtain @xmath142 , the relation appropriate to a semicircular spectral shape rather than to a gaussian @xcite .",
    "so the extent to which the spectrum deviates from a gaussian shape towards a semicircle may be estimated by considering the probability that successive two - body interactions do not involve distinct pairs of particles .",
    "consider for example a pure @xmath11 two - body coupling . in an @xmath28 four - body state",
    "( eq .  [ type0c ] ) , there are a total of three @xmath11 pairs , as we have already seen above .",
    "after two of the particles interact in a two - body @xmath11 combination , the remaining two particles are guaranteed to be also in a @xmath11 state .",
    "so there is a @xmath143 probability that the next interaction will involve the two particles that have not yet interacted , and thus @xmath144 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the total many - body state is either @xmath66 ( eq .  [ type1c ] ) or @xmath98 , similar counting arguments lead to the conclusion that there is only a @xmath145 probability that the second interacting @xmath11 pair will be disjoint from the first ; thus @xmath146 .",
    "this behavior for the spectral shapes has been numerically confirmed ( e.g. , for @xmath147 orbitals , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 , for total many - body spin @xmath28 , @xmath36 , and @xmath100 , respectively ) , and is similar for the @xmath8 two - body interaction .",
    "so in particular for the @xmath125 case of equal couplings , although the widths of the @xmath28 and @xmath66 spectra approach each other in the @xmath64 limit ( eq .  [ equalcouplingwidth ] ) , the fourth moments remain in a finite ratio in this limit and lead to @xmath136 having a substantially longer tail than @xmath137 .",
    "therefore , despite the almost equal widths , ground states in a @xmath125 system will be predominantly @xmath28 , even in the dilute @xmath64 limit .",
    "the above analysis of the @xmath29 particle system generalizes easily to the real @xmath1-body problem that we are interested in .",
    "we begin , as before , by addressing the behavior of the spectral widths in the @xmath28 and @xmath66 spin sectors .",
    "typical basis states in these two sectors were already given above in eq .",
    "[ typecmany ] . now consider a pure @xmath8 coupling . from eq .",
    "[ j0gen ] we get @xmath151 in the dilute @xmath64 limit .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "the only difference scaling as @xmath152 in the spectral width is that the @xmath107 pair in eq .",
    "[ typecmany ] is in a @xmath8 combination for a many body - state of total spin @xmath28 , but not if the many - body state has total spin @xmath66 .",
    "thus , the @xmath28 state has one more @xmath8 pair that can be acted on by the hamiltonian , out of a total of @xmath153 pairs with @xmath8 .",
    "similarly , for a pure @xmath11 coupling we have one extra pair that can be acted on in an @xmath66 many - body state ( out of a total of @xmath154 pairs with @xmath11 ) , so finally @xmath155 if we keep the number of particles @xmath1 fixed and take the system size @xmath64 , then the many - body level spacing of course goes to zero , while the width ratio remains finite for @xmath156 .",
    "once again we see , this time for general values of @xmath1 , that assuming the spectral structure is dominated by the spectral width , we expect @xmath47 ( @xmath124 ) @xmath28 ground states if @xmath157 ( @xmath158 ) , in the dilute @xmath64 limit .    however , we saw in our discussion above of the @xmath29 special case that spectral cumulants beyond @xmath53 need also to be included in a full analysis .",
    "the ratio @xmath159 always favors a longer tail for @xmath28 , so we only need to consider the case of a @xmath11 coupling , where the width effect and the spectral shape effect are competing with one another . referring back to eq .",
    "[ typecmany ] , we note that if particles on orbitals @xmath68 and @xmath160 interact via a two - body @xmath11 interaction , then the two particles which remain on sites @xmath69 and @xmath161 are also in a @xmath11 state and can subsequently interact if and only if the total system is in an @xmath28 state ( so that the four particles @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 are in an @xmath28 state ) . because the @xmath69 , @xmath161 pair is distinct from the @xmath68 , @xmath160 pair by construction , this causes it to be more likely that the next @xmath11 pair of interacting particles will be distinct from @xmath68 , @xmath160 if @xmath28 , and contributes towards an enhancement of the shape ratio @xmath162 as compared with @xmath163 .",
    "however , in a many - body system this effect is suppressed by @xmath164 ( because there are @xmath165 ways to choose two pairs , and only @xmath166 of them are involved in this effect ) .",
    "so for @xmath167 the @xmath168 difference in widths between @xmath137 and @xmath136 ( eq .  [ widthmany ] ) is expected to exceed the difference in spectral shapes , leading to a dominance of @xmath169 states near the edge of the spectrum , in the dilute many - body limit ( which we define as @xmath64 first , followed by @xmath170 ) .    for @xmath157 , on the other hand ,",
    "both the difference in widths and difference in spectral shapes favors an @xmath28 ground state , and this behavior is expected to persist into the dilute many - body limit . for @xmath125 ,",
    "the relative width difference vanishes ( eq .  [ widthmany ] ) in this limit , but the difference in spectral shapes now takes over , again leading to @xmath28 dominance near the edge of the spectrum .",
    "we have seen that for finite ( large enough ) number of particles @xmath1 , @xmath28 ground state dominance is expected in the dilute @xmath64 limit , as long as the spin - zero two - body coupling is at least as large as the spin - one coupling , @xmath171 . in the contrary case , the situation is reversed , with higher - spin states dominating behavior near the edge of the spectrum .",
    "what happens , though , if the system is not very dilute ? for a finite number of single - particle orbitals @xmath3 , we must take into account the subleading behavior in @xmath3 of the spectral widths .",
    "an argument very similar to the one leading to eq .",
    "[ equalcouplingwidth ] , but generalized to large @xmath1 and to an arbitrary ratio of couplings @xmath172 shows that the effect discussed there always favors the @xmath28 width , at @xmath173 , independent of which coupling is stronger .",
    "so for @xmath171 nothing particularly interesting happens at finite densities ; the preference for @xmath28 states near the edge is only enhanced by finite density effects .",
    "this preference , however , becomes small ( compared to the level spacing ) in the many - body limit .",
    "on the other hand , for a stronger spin-@xmath36 coupling ( @xmath158 ) , we expect the @xmath168 effect favoring @xmath28 ground states and the @xmath173 effect favoring @xmath169 ground states to balance each other , leading to a transition in the width ratio at finite densities .",
    "in fact a closer analysis of the @xmath174body system ( eq .",
    "[ traces4 ] ) , setting equal the terms proportional to @xmath175 in the two expressions , shows that for a pure @xmath11 coupling we have a transition just below @xmath60 , with a larger @xmath28 width for @xmath176 and larger @xmath169 widths for @xmath177 .",
    "this is consistent with our numerical observations above . for comparable coupling strengths",
    ", the transition of course will take place at lower densities ; so , for example for @xmath178 , the transition in the width ratio occurs near @xmath179 .",
    "although we are unable to observe this transition numerically for larger numbers of particles , the analytical arguments suggest that one should take place in general at densities @xmath180 for a small coupling difference @xmath181 and at an @xmath182 finite density for a pure @xmath11 interaction .      in table",
    "[ tabgs ] we show some results of a numerical calculation for @xmath29 particles distributed over @xmath183 orbitals , with a pure @xmath11 two - body coupling ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) .",
    "the first row of the table shows the ratio of widths @xmath184 in sectors of total many - body spin @xmath28 and @xmath66 .",
    "we see that @xmath116 holds at low @xmath3 ( high density ) , while in the dilute regime ( @xmath185 ) the relation is reversed .",
    "the crossover occurs near @xmath60 for @xmath29 , in good agreement with our analytical expectations ( see section  [ findens ] ) .",
    "the same qualitative behavior is predicted and observed for the higher spin sectors ; we see from the second row of the table that the crossover between @xmath66 and @xmath98 dominance occurs at @xmath186 .",
    "we proceed to compare the energies of the lowest - lying states in the different spin sectors , and find a trend towards lower - lying states of higher spin as @xmath3 increases , entirely consistent with the results for the spectral widths .",
    "however , by comparing rows 1 and 3 ( or 2 and 4 ) of the table , we see that for any given system size @xmath3 , low - lying states with small total spin are preferred more than would be expected based simply on the width ratio .",
    "thus , for @xmath60 , where the spin-@xmath31 and spin-@xmath36 widths are nearly equal , the ground state of the system is still nearly always @xmath28 , and on average the ground state is observed to have energy @xmath187 lower than that of the lowest @xmath66 state .",
    "this is due largely to the spectral shape effects discussed above in section  [ shape ] , which favor ground states of lower total spin given equal spectral widths in the different spin sectors .",
    "when comparing @xmath28 and @xmath66 sectors in particular , we recall from section  [ shape ] that the ratio @xmath188 is significanlty larger for @xmath28 , for any value of @xmath3 . for @xmath189 ( see section  [ manybody ] ) , spectral shape effects are reduced , but unfortunately we are unable to probe the dilute @xmath190 regime numerically for @xmath191",
    ". instead we stay at @xmath29 particles and compare the @xmath66 and @xmath98 sectors , which as we saw previously have nearly equal values of the ratio @xmath192 .",
    "indeed , by @xmath42 the mean values of the lowest - lying @xmath66 and @xmath98 states become almost equal , and already by @xmath186 the lowest - lying @xmath98 state appears before the lowest - lying @xmath66 state in a significant fraction of systems in the ensemble .",
    "the last row of the table supports the analytical arguments presented above for a transition between lower - spin and higher - spin ground states as a function of the particle density .",
    "as we have mentioned previously , the model ( eq .  [ twobodyham ] ) assumes that there is no correlation between two - body interactions in @xmath8 and @xmath11 two - body states .",
    "we may instead consider an alternative model , motivated by ref .",
    "@xcite and much subsequent work , in which the interaction hamiltonian is separated into a spin - independent and a spin - dependent part : @xmath193 where the indices @xmath194 @xmath195 @xmath196 and @xmath91 label individual orbitals , @xmath197 @xmath198 @xmath199 and @xmath200 are the @xmath201components of spin for each of the four fermions , and total spin conservation has been enforced .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath202 and @xmath203 are taken to be real gaussian random and independent variables , with the constraints @xmath204 ( and similarly for the @xmath203 ) imposed by the reality of wave functions and the symmetry of the two - body interaction .",
    "the constants @xmath205 and @xmath206 determine , of course , the relative strengths of the spin - independent and spin - coupled interactions .",
    "the behavior near the ground state for the model of eq .",
    "[ vijklham ] can be understood in terms very similar to those we used for analyzing the original model of eq .",
    "[ twobodyham ] .",
    "we assume initially that spin - spin interactions can not be neglected , i.e. @xmath207 .",
    "we first note that the spin - spin interaction @xmath208 is three times stronger when particles @xmath90 and @xmath91 are in a @xmath8 two - body state as compared with a @xmath11 two - body state .",
    "now we have seen above that an @xmath28 @xmath25particle many - body state has @xmath168 more @xmath8 pairs than an @xmath66 many body state : this leads to a wider @xmath136 envelope and @xmath28 ground state dominance , just as for the @xmath157 situation considered in the previous model .",
    "thus , a spin - spin interaction ( of either sign ) is seen immediately to lead to @xmath28 ground state dominance ( @xmath47 dominance in the @xmath64 many - orbital limit ) . at finite densities ,",
    "@xmath209 , we must once again include corrections to the width difference , of order @xmath210 , as in eq .",
    "[ equalcouplingwidth ] and in section  [ findens ] above .",
    "we find , however , that the subleading correction , associated with the impossibility of doubling up two particles in a @xmath11 two - body state , always favors the @xmath28 many - body state .",
    "this is a model - independent property , resulting simply from the counting of two - body @xmath8 vs. @xmath11 pairs in a many - body state .",
    "therefore the @xmath168 and @xmath173 effects contribute with the same sign , and even at finite density we expect an excess of @xmath28 ground states .",
    "finally , for small systems , shape effects ( discussed above in section  [ shape ] ) also contribute , again favoring the @xmath28 ground state .",
    "we may also consider the scenario of a spin - free interaction ( @xmath211 ) , which because of the equal strength with which it couples @xmath28 and @xmath66 pairs may be compared with the @xmath125 special case discussed above for the model of eq .",
    "[ twobodyham ] . as in that case",
    ", the width difference is now expected to vanish in the @xmath64 dilute limit ; furthermore as before the width difference eventually becomes small compared with the level spacing in the system .",
    "however , at moderate values of the particle number @xmath1 , spectral shape effects are expected to be very important , leading to @xmath28 ground state excess at arbitrarily large values of @xmath3 .",
    "in realistic many - body systems there are strong correlations between ground states of different quantum numbers , and the pairing correlation is of particular importance .",
    "this correlation has also been observed in various studies of nuclear models with random two - body interactions  @xcite . in this section",
    "we investigate correlations between energies and wave functions of low lying states with different quantum numbers .",
    "pairing is a well known phenomenon in many - body fermion systems .",
    "its spectral signature is an energy gap that separates the ground state from the excited states . in the presence of pairing ,",
    "the ground state is a condensate of pairs of fermions whose quantum numbers are related to each other by time reversal symmetry . in the case of the spin systems considered in this work , pairing refers to a ground state of the form @xmath212 , where @xmath213 is a quasi - particle operator that is related to the single - particle operators @xmath214 by a unitary transformation , as @xmath215 .",
    "let us first consider pairing in the single - particle basis generated by the @xmath214 .",
    "the results on wave function structure in random spin systems reported in ref .",
    "@xcite show that states at high spectral densities have a number of principal components that agrees with standard random matrix theory , while low - lying states have a considerably smaller number of principal components ( thus indicating a simpler structure and some degree of regularity @xcite ) .",
    "however , the structure even of the low - lying states was found to be much more complex than a simple slater determinant .",
    "based on that previous analysis , and on the analytical results obtained above in eq .",
    "[ j0gen ] showing very weak dependence of spectral width on double occupancy number , we do not expect to find pairing here in the single - particle basis .",
    "to compare these arguments with numerical data we measure the number of doubly occupied single - particle orbitals in a given eigenstate @xmath216 with energy @xmath217 and total spin @xmath49 by computing @xmath218 ( compare the related quantity @xmath62 for basis states in section  [ secwidthgen ] ) .",
    "for an ensemble of @xmath219 random hamiltonians with @xmath43 spin-@xmath220 fermions on @xmath221 sites , @xmath222 and @xmath33 , @xmath223 shows fluctuations around @xmath224 , @xmath225 , @xmath226 and does not exhibit any significant energy dependence .",
    "thus , no pairing is present in the single - particle basis @xmath214 .",
    "the numerical results agree well with the analytical expressions @xmath227 , @xmath228 , and @xmath229 .",
    "pairing in a general quasi - particle basis can most conveniently be investigated by examining its spectral signature .",
    "the existence of a pairing gap is closely related to the approximate degeneracy of the first excited spin-0 level @xmath230 with the lowest - energy spin - one state @xmath231 . within the two different models considered in this work , we do not observe any degeneracy between @xmath230 and @xmath231 , and find the ratio of splitting to gap as 2.8 for an ensemble of @xmath219 hamiltonians with @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath232 .",
    "similar results hold for other parameter values , and we never see @xmath233 , which would be indicative of a pairing structure .",
    "thus , the dominance of spin-0 ground states can not be caused by pairing correlations within our model .",
    "note that this result differs from the observations made for the nuclear shell model with random interactions  @xcite . as an illustration",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig_spec ] the spin dependent spectra for a system of six fermions on six single - particle orbitals .",

    "the absence of low - lying spin - degenerate states clearly indicates the absence of pairing correlations .    to study further the subject of pairing ,",
    "we add a one - body part of the form h_1=c_j=1^m j(a^_ja_j+",
    "a^_ja_j ) to the hamiltonian ( eq .  [ twobodyham ] ) . fig .",
    "[ fig_pair ] shows the pairing observable @xmath234 as a function of @xmath235 for @xmath33 and @xmath236 . for @xmath237",
    "we find @xmath238 , indicating strong pairing . in this regime",
    "the two - body interaction is a small perturbation , and we obtain pairing in the basis of single particle states . note that this behavior is not caused by the harmonic form of our one - body potential but rather is determined by the applicability of a single - particle picture . for decreasing values of @xmath239",
    "one leaves this perturbative regime , and the increase of @xmath234 shows that pairing is suppressed .",
    "note that @xmath240 at sufficiently small values of @xmath239 .",
    "this indicates that there are several spin-0 levels below the spin-1 ground state , as in fig .",
    "[ fig_spec ] above .",
    "this finding is consistent with the results of section  [ secspinstruct ] and hints at the dominance of spin-0 low - lying states . as a check we also replaced the spin-1 ground state energy by the highest spin-1 energy (",
    "which should not be at all correlated with the spin-0 ground state energy ) , while correcting for a nonzero mean of the total spectral density , i.e. replacing @xmath241 , and recomputed @xmath234 . for the system with a pure two - body force we found no difference when compared to the previous results , confirming that the value of @xmath234 at @xmath242 is consistent with random spectral fluctuations .",
    "the absence of pairing in the presence of a strong two - body force is peculiar to our model and is not shared by nuclear shell models with random interactions .",
    "it is therefore interesting to look for different correlations between low lying states of spin-0 and spin-1 .",
    "such correlations have been observed previously in refs .",
    "we therefore look at the generalized collectivity defined as f , where @xmath243 and b_ij= ( a_i ^a_j ^+",
    "a_i ^a_j ^ ) ( a_i a_j - a_i a_j ) is a spin - flip operator that transforms a pair of spin zero into a pair of spin one .",

    "@xcite we choose the coefficients as c_ij = s=1|b_ij|s=0 .",
    "this is more convenient than searching for those coefficients @xmath244 that maximize @xmath245 . to be definite ,",
    "we take the ground states of spin zero and spin one , i.e. @xmath246 and @xmath247 , and compare with the corresponding value that is obtained by substituting @xmath248 . the states corresponding to the highest and lowest energies in a sector of definite spin",
    "are assumed to be uncorrelated .",
    "the results are presented in table  [ tab1 ] for @xmath29 and different values of @xmath3 , once again setting @xmath33 .",
    "obviously , there is a strong correlation between the ground states of different spin .",
    "it is instructive to let @xmath249 run through the @xmath250 lowest lying spin-@xmath36 states @xmath251 while keeping @xmath246 fixed .",
    "figure  [ fig_corr ] shows that the correlation is strongest for the ground states and decreases for the higher lying states .",
    "this finding is consistent with the recent observation  @xcite that low - lying states are weakly localized in fock space , while high - lying states are delocalized and agree with random matrix predictions .",
    "it is also interesting to consider energy correlations between ground states of spin zero and spin one .",
    "the appropriate correlator is g where @xmath252 and @xmath23 denotes an ensemble average .",
    "we find @xmath253 for @xmath29 particles on @xmath186 sites ( with @xmath33 ) , indicating a strong correlation .",
    "the observable @xmath254 , is however , somewhat misleading , since a significant part of the fluctuations @xmath255 from one realization of the ensemble to another arises simply from the fluctuation of the centroid and width of the overall spectral envelope , @xmath256 and @xmath257 .",
    "the centroid and width for a given system are almost identical in sectors of different total many - body spin . to understand fluctuations _ under _ the spectral envelopes , we should therefore remove this trivial effect by considering the correlation @xmath258 of @xmath259 and @xmath260 , where @xmath261 we then obtain @xmath262 for the same set of parameters .",
    "the value of @xmath258 increases as one goes to larger systems ; e.g. for @xmath29 particles , @xmath258 increases monotonically from @xmath263 to @xmath264 as @xmath3 goes from @xmath109 to @xmath265 .",
    "these observations are consistent with the existence of correlations between the wave functions of the corresponding states .",
    "note that the observation of strong correlations between low - lying states of spin-0 and spin-1 is in qualitative agreement with results in shell models and interacting boson models .",
    "however , in contrast with the findings in these nuclear models , we do not find any indications of a pairing correlation in the spin systems considered in this work .",
    "one can only speculate that this is due to the additional isospin degrees of freedom and the more sophisticated angular momentum coupling scheme used in the nuclear models .",
    "we have investigated the spin structure of low lying states in fermion systems with random two - body interactions .",
    "numerical calculations show that the ground state has spin zero with almost 100% probability . for a dilute system",
    "we derive analytical expressions for the shapes and widths of the spectral densities at different spin .",
    "these explain our numerical results . for systems with a spin-1 coupling that is stronger than the spin-0 two - body coupling",
    "we predict a transition from spin-0 ground states to ground states of higher spin . while it is difficult to access this regime numerically , we do observe one of its precursors  namely a spin-2 ground state that is lower in energy than the spin-1 ground state .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that there are strong correlations between wave functions and energies of low - lying states of different spin quantum number .",
    "the wave function correlations are manifest in expectation values of spin transition operators and indicate some degree of collective behavior .",
    "the existence of energy correlations confirm the picture about the dominance of spin-0 ground states .",
    "these correlations decrease as one moves away from the ground state region . in the absence of a one - body force",
    "we find no indication for any pairing correlation between low lying states , and our model differs herein from the nuclear models with random interactions .",
