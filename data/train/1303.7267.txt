    "one of the most important and intriging issues of modern physics is the so called  cosmological constant problem \" @xcite , ( ccp ) , most easily seen by studying the apparently uncontrolled behaviour of the zero point energies , which would lead to a corresponding equally uncontrolled vacuum energy or cosmological constant term .",
    "even staying at the classical level , the observed very small cosmological term in the present universe is still very puzzling .",
    "furthermore , the cosmological constant problem has evolved from the  old cosmological constant problem \" , where physicist were concerned with explaining why the observed vacuum energy density of the universe is exactly zero , to different type of ccp since the evidence for the accelerating universe became evident , for reviews see @xcite .",
    "we have therefore since the discovery of the accelerated universe a ",
    "new cosmological constant problem \" @xcite , the problem is now not to explain zero , but to explain a very small vacuum energy density .",
    "this new situation posed by the discovery of a very small vacuum energy density of the universe means that getting a zero vacuum energy density for the present universe is definitely not the full solution of the problem , although it may be a step towards its solution .",
    "one point of view to the ccp that has been popular has been to provide a bound based on the  anthropic principle \" @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "a too large cosmological constant will not provide the necessary conditions required for the existence of life , the anthropic principle provides then an upper bound on the cosmological constant .",
    "one problem with this approach is for example that it relies on our knowledge of life as we know it and ignores the possibility that other life forms could be possible , for which other ( unknown ) bounds would be relevant , therefore the reasoning appears by its very nature subjective , since of course if the observed cosmological constant will be different , our universe will be different and this could include different kind of life that may be could have adjusted itself to a higher cosmological constant of the universe . but even accepting the validity of anthropic considerations , we still do not understand why the observed vacuum energy density must be positive instead of possibly a very small negative quantity . accepting the anthropic explanation means may be also giving up on discovering important physics related to the ccp and this may be the biggest objection .",
    "nevertheless , the idea of associating somehow restrictions on the origin of the universe with the cosmological constant problem seems interesting",
    ". we will take on this point of view , but leave out the not understood concept of life out from our considerations .",
    "instead , we will require , in a very specific framework , the non - singular origin of the universe .",
    "the advantage of this point of view is that it is formulated in terms of ideas of physics alone , without reference to biology , which unlike physics , has not reached the level of an exact science .",
    "another interesting consequence is that we can learn that of a non - singularly created universe may not have a too big cosmological constant , an effect that points to a certain type of gravitational suppression of uv divergences in quantum field theory .    in this respect",
    ", one should point out that even in the context of the inflationary scenario @xcite which solves many cosmological problems , one still encounters the initial singularity problem which remains unsolved , showing that the universe necessarily had a singular beginning for generic inflationary cosmologies @xcite .    here",
    "we will adopt the very attractive  emergent universe \" scenario , where those conclusions concerning singularities can be avoided @xcite .",
    "the way to escape the singularity in these models is to violate the geometrical assumptions of these theorems , which assume i ) that the universe has open space sections ii ) the hubble expansion is always greater than zero in the past . in @xcite",
    "the open space section condition is violated since closed robertson walker universes with @xmath7 are considered and the hubble expansion can become zero , so that both i ) and ii ) are avoided .    in @xcite",
    "even models based on standard general relativity , ordinary matter and minimally coupled scalar fields were considered and can provide indeed a non - singular ( geodesically complete ) inflationary universe , with a past eternal einstein static universe that eventually evolves into an inflationary universe .",
    "those most simple models suffer however from instabilities , associated with the instability of the einstein static universe .",
    "the instability is possible to cure by going away from gr , considering non perturbative corrections to the einstein s field equations in the context of the loop quantum gravity @xcite , a brane world cosmology with a time like extra dimension @xcite considering the starobinski model for radiative corrections ( which can not be derived from an effective action ) @xcite or exotic matter @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , the consideration of a jordan brans dicke model also can provide a stable initial state for the emerging universe scenario @xcite .    in this review",
    "we study a different theoretical framework where such emerging universe scenario is realized in a natural way , where instabilities are avoided and a succesfull inflationary phase with a graceful exit can be achieved .",
    "the model we will use was studied first in @xcite , however , in the context of this model , a few scenarios are possible .",
    "for example in the first paper on this model @xcite a special choice of state to describe the present state of our universe was made .",
    "then in @xcite a different candidate for the vacuum that represents our present universe was made .",
    "the way in which we best represents the present state of the universe is crucial , since as it should be obvious , the discussion of the ccp depends on what vacuum we take . in @xcite",
    "we expressed the stability and existence conditions for the non - singular universe in terms of the energy of the vacuum of our candidate for the present universe .",
    "in @xcite a few typos in @xcite were corrected and also the discussion of some notions discussed was improved in @xcite and more deeper studies will be done in this review .    indeed in this review , all those topics will be further clarified , in particular the vacuum structure of this model will be extended .",
    "a very important new feature that will be presented in this review is the existence of a  kinetic vacuum \" , that produces a vacuum energy state",
    "which is degenerate with the vacuum choice made in @xcite , this degeneracy is analyzed and the dynamical role of this kinetic vacuum in the evolution of the universe and the ccp is analyzed .",
    "we work in the context of a theory built along the lines of the two measures theory ( tmt ) .",
    "basic idea is developed in @xcite , @xcite-@xcite @xcite , @xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite , @xcite and more specifically in the context of the scale invariant realization of such theories @xcite , @xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite , @xcite .",
    "these theories can provide a new approach to the cosmological constant problem and can be generalized to obtain also a theory with a dynamical spacetime @xcite , furthermore , string and brane theories , as well as brane world scenarios can be constructed using two measure theories ideas @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we should also point out that the hodge dual construction of @xcite for supergravity constitutes in fact an example of a tmt .",
    "the construction by comelli @xcite where no square root of the determinant of the metric is used and instead a total divergence appears is also a very much related approach .",
    "the two measure theories have many points of similarity with `` lagrange multiplier gravity ( lmg ) '' @xcite . in lmg",
    "there is a lagrange multiplier field which enforces the condition that a certain function is zero . for a comparison of one of these lagrange",
    "multiplier gravity models with observations see @xcite . in the two measure theory",
    "this is equivalent to the constraint which requires some lagrangian to be constant .",
    "the two measure model presented here , as opposed to the lmg models of @xcite provide us with an arbitrary constant of integration .",
    "the introduction of constraints can cause dirac fields to contribute to dark energy @xcite or scalar fields to behave like dust like in @xcite and this dust behaviour can be caused by the stabilization of a tachyonic field due to the constraint , accompanied by a floating dark energy component @xcite .",
    "tmt models naturally avoid the 5th force problem @xcite .",
    "we will consider a slight generalization of the tmt case , where , we consider also the possible effects of zero point energy densities , thus  softly breaking \" the basic structure of tmt for this purpose .",
    "we will show how the stated goals of a stable emergent universe can be achieved in the framework of the model and also how the stability of the emerging universe imposes interesting constraints on the energy density of the ground state of the theory as defined in this paper : it must be positive but not very large , thus the vacuum energy and therefore the term that softly breaks the tmt structure appears to be naturally controlled .",
    "an important ingredient of the model considered here is its softly broken conformal invariance , meaning that we allow conformal breaking terms only though potentials of the dilaton , which nevertheless preserve global scale invariance . in another models for emergent universe we have studied @xcite , that rule of softly broken conformal invariance",
    "was taken into account .",
    "it is also a perfectly consistent , but different approach .",
    "the review will be organized as follows : first we review the principles of the tmt and in particular the model studied in @xcite , which has global scale invariance and how this can be the basis for the emerging universe .",
    "such model gives rise , in the effective einstein frame , to an effective potential for a dilaton field ( needed to implement an interesting model with global scale invariance ) which has a flat region .",
    "following this , we look at the generalization of this model @xcite by adding a curvature square or simply  @xmath8 term \" and show that the resulting model contains now two flat regions .",
    "the existence of two flat regions for the potential is shown to be consequence of the s.s.b .",
    "of the scale symmetry .",
    "we then consider the incorporation in the model of the zero point fluctuations , parametrized by a cosmological constant in the einstein frame . in this resulting model ,",
    "there are two possible types of emerging universe solutions , for one of those , the initial einstein universe can be stabilized due to the non linearities of the model , provided the vacuum energy density of the ground state is positive but not very large .",
    "this is a very satisfactory results , since it means that the stability of the emerging universe prevents the vacuum energy in the present universe from being very large!. the transition from the emergent universe to the ground state goes through an intermediate inflationary phase , therefore reproducing the basic standard cosmological model as well .",
    "we end with a discussion section and present the point of view that the creation of the universe can be considered as a  threshold event \" for zero present vacuum energy density , which naturally gives a positive but small vacuum energy density .",
    "the general structure of general coordinate invariant theories is taken usually as @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "the introduction of @xmath11 is required since @xmath12 by itself is not a scalar but the product @xmath13 is a scalar . inserting @xmath11 , which has the transformation properties of a density , produces a scalar action @xmath14 , as defined by eq.([1 ] ) , provided @xmath15 is a scalar .    in principle nothing prevents us from considering other densities instead of @xmath11 .",
    "one construction of such alternative  measure of integration \" , is obtained as follows : given 4-scalars @xmath16 ( a = 1,2,3,4 ) , one can construct the density @xmath17 and consider in addition to the action @xmath14 , as defined by eq.([1 ] ) , @xmath18 , defined as @xmath19 @xmath20 is again some scalar , which may contain the curvature ( i.e. the gravitational contribution ) and a matter contribution , as it can be the case for @xmath14 , as defined by eq.([1 ] ) .",
    "for an approach that uses four - vectors instead of four - scalars see @xcite .    in the action @xmath18 defined by eq.([3 ] )",
    "the measure carries degrees of freedom independent of that of the metric and that of the matter fields .",
    "the most natural and successful formulation of the theory is achieved when the connection is also treated as an independent degree of freedom .",
    "this is what is usually referred to as the first order formalism .",
    "one can consider both contributions , and allowing therefore both geometrical objects to enter the theory and take as our action @xmath21    here @xmath15 and @xmath20 are @xmath16 independent .",
    "we will study now the dynamics of a scalar field @xmath3 interacting with gravity as given by the following action , where except for the potential terms @xmath22 and @xmath23 we have conformal invariance , the potential terms @xmath22 and @xmath23 break down this to global scale invariance .    @xmath24    @xmath25    @xmath26    @xmath27    @xmath28    the suffix @xmath29 in @xmath30 is to emphasize that here the curvature appears only linearly . here ,",
    "except for the potential terms @xmath22 and @xmath23 we have conformal invariance , the potential terms @xmath22 and @xmath23 break down this to global scale invariance .",
    "since the breaking of local conformal invariance is only through potential terms , we call this a  soft breaking \" .    in the variational principle @xmath31 , the measure fields scalars @xmath16 and",
    "the  matter \" - scalar field @xmath3 are all to be treated as independent variables although the variational principle may result in equations that allow us to solve some of these variables in terms of others .    for the case",
    "the potential terms @xmath32 we have local conformal invariance    @xmath33    and @xmath16 is transformed according to @xmath34    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the jacobian of the transformation of the @xmath16 fields .",
    "this will be a symmetry in the case @xmath32 if @xmath37 notice that @xmath38 can be a local function of space time , this can be arranged by performing for the @xmath16 fields one of the ( infinite ) possible diffeomorphims in the internal @xmath16 space .",
    "we can still retain a global scale invariance in model for very special exponential form for the @xmath22 and @xmath23 potentials .",
    "indeed , if we perform the global scale transformation ( @xmath39 = constant ) @xmath40 then ( 9 ) is invariant provided @xmath41 and @xmath42 are of the form @xcite @xmath43 and @xmath16 is transformed according to @xmath44 which means @xmath45 such that @xmath46 and @xmath47    we will now work out the equations of motion after introducing @xmath41 and @xmath42 and see how the integration of the equations of motion allows the spontaneous breaking of the scale invariance .",
    "let us begin by considering the equations which are obtained from the variation of the fields that appear in the measure , i.e. the @xmath16 fields .",
    "we obtain then @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "since it is easy to check that @xmath50 , it follows that det @xmath51 if @xmath52 .",
    "therefore if @xmath52 we obtain that @xmath53 , or that @xmath54 where m is constant .",
    "notice that this equation breaks spontaneously the global scale invariance of the theory , since the left hand side has a non trivial transformation under the scale transformations , while the right hand side is equal to @xmath55 , a constant that after we integrate the equations is fixed , can not be changed and therefore for any @xmath56 we have obtained indeed , spontaneous breaking of scale invariance .",
    "we will see what is the connection now .",
    "as we will see , the connection appears in the original frame as a non riemannian object .",
    "however , we will see that by a simple conformal tranformation of the metric we can recover the riemannian structure .",
    "the interpretation of the equations in the frame gives then an interesting physical picture , as we will see .",
    "let us begin by studying the equations obtained from the variation of the connections @xmath57 .",
    "we obtain then @xmath58 if we define @xmath59 as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the christoffel symbol , we obtain for @xmath59 the equation @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "the general solution of eq.([e28 ] ) is @xmath64[e30 ] where @xmath65 is an arbitrary function due to the @xmath65 - symmetry of the curvature @xcite @xmath66 , @xmath67 z being any scalar ( which means @xmath68 ) .",
    "if we choose the gauge @xmath69 , we obtain @xmath70    considering now the variation with respect to @xmath71 , we obtain @xmath72 solving for @xmath73 from eq.([e31 ] ) and introducing in eq.[e25 ] , we obtain @xmath74 a constraint that allows us to solve for @xmath75 , @xmath76    to get the physical content of the theory , it is best consider variables that have well defined dynamical interpretation .",
    "the original metric does not has a non zero canonical momenta .",
    "the fundamental variable of the theory in the first order formalism is the connection and its canonical momenta is a function of @xmath77 , given by ,    @xmath78    and @xmath75 given by eq.([e33 ] ) .",
    "interestingly enough , working with @xmath77 is the same as going to the ",
    "einstein conformal frame \" . in terms of @xmath77",
    "the non riemannian contribution @xmath79 dissappears from the equations .",
    "this is because the connection can be written as the christoffel symbol of the metric @xmath77 . in terms of @xmath77 the equations of motion for the metric can be written then in the einstein form ( we define @xmath80 usual ricci tensor in terms of the bar metric @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) @xmath83 where @xmath84    and @xmath85    in terms of the metric @xmath86 , the equation of motion of the scalar field @xmath3 takes the standard general - relativity form @xmath87    notice that if @xmath88 and @xmath89 also , provided @xmath90 is finite and @xmath91 there .",
    "this means the zero cosmological constant state is achieved without any sort of fine tuning .",
    "that is , independently of whether we add to @xmath23 a constant piece , or whether we change the value of @xmath55 , as long as there is still a point where @xmath92 , then still @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( still provided @xmath90 is finite and @xmath91 there ) .",
    "this is the basic feature that characterizes the tmt and allows it to solve the  old \" cosmological constant problem , at least at the classical level .    in what follows we will study the effective potential ( [ e37 ] ) for the special case of global scale invariance , which as we will see displays additional very special features which makes it attractive in the context of cosmology .",
    "notice that in terms of the variables @xmath3 , @xmath77 , the  scale \" transformation becomes only a shift in the scalar field @xmath3 , since @xmath77 is invariant ( since @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) @xmath97    if @xmath98 and @xmath99 as required by scale invariance eqs .",
    "( [ e18 ] , [ e20 ] , [ e21 ] , [ e22 ] , [ e23 ] ) , we obtain from the expression ( [ e37 ] ) @xmath100    since we can always perform the transformation @xmath101 we can choose by convention @xmath102 .",
    "we then see that as @xmath103 const . providing an infinite flat region as depicted in fig",
    "also a minimum is achieved at zero cosmological constant for the case @xmath104 at the point @xmath105    in conclusion , the scale invariance of the original theory is responsible for the non appearance ( in the physics ) of a certain scale , that associated to m. however , masses do appear , since the coupling to two different measures of @xmath15 and @xmath20 allow us to introduce two independent couplings @xmath106 and @xmath107 , a situation which is unlike the standard formulation of globally scale invariant theories , where usually no stable vacuum state exists .",
    "the constant of integration @xmath55 plays a very important role indeed : any non vanishing value for this constant implements , already at the classical level s.s.b . of scale invariance .",
    "as we have seen , it is possible to obtain a model that through a spontaneous breaking of scale invariace can give us a flat region .",
    "we want to obtain now two flat regions in our effective potential . a simple generalization of the action @xmath30 will fix this .",
    "the basic new feature we add is the presence is higher curvature terms in the action @xcite-@xcite , which have been shown to be very relevant in cosmology .",
    "in particular he first inflationary model from a model with higher terms in the curvature was proposed in @xcite .",
    "what one needs to do is simply consider the addition of a scale invariant term of the form    @xmath108    the total action being then @xmath109 .",
    "in the first order formalism @xmath110 is not only globally scale invariant but also locally scale invariant , that is conformally invariant ( recall that in the first order formalism the connection is an independent degree of freedom and it does not transform under a conformal transformation of the metric ) .",
    "let us see what the equations of motion tell us , now with the addition of @xmath111 to the action .",
    "first of all , since the addition has been only to the part of the action that couples to @xmath112 , the equations of motion derived from the variation of the measure fields remains unchanged . that is eq.([e25 ] ) remains valid .",
    "the variation of the action with respect to @xmath113 gives now    @xmath114    it is interesting to notice that if we contract this equation with @xmath113 , the @xmath115 terms do not contribute .",
    "this means that the same value for the scalar curvature @xmath116 is obtained as in section 2 , if we express our result in terms of @xmath3 , its derivatives and @xmath113 . solving the scalar curvature from this and inserting in the other @xmath115 - independent equation",
    "@xmath117 we get still the same solution for the ratio of the measures which was found in the case where the @xmath115 terms were absent , i.e. @xmath118 .    in the presence of the @xmath119 term in the action , eq .",
    "( [ e26 ] ) gets modified so that instead of @xmath120 , @xmath121 = @xmath122 appears .",
    "this in turn implies that eq.([e27 ] ) keeps its form but where @xmath123 is replaced by @xmath124 , where once again , @xmath125 .",
    "following then the same steps as in the model without the curvature square terms , we can then verify that the connection is the christoffel symbol of the metric @xmath77 given by    @xmath126    @xmath127 defines now the  einstein frame \" .",
    "equations ( [ e46 ] ) can now be expressed in the  einstein form \"    @xmath128    where    @xmath129    where    @xmath130    here it is satisfied that @xmath131 , equation that expressed in terms of @xmath132 becomes    @xmath133 .",
    "this allows us to solve for @xmath116 and we get ,    @xmath134    notice that if we express @xmath116 in terms of @xmath3 , its derivatives and @xmath113 , the result is the same as in the model without the curvature squared term , this is not true anymore once we express @xmath116 in terms of @xmath3 , its derivatives and @xmath135 .    in any case",
    ", once we insert ( [ e51 ] ) into ( [ e50 ] ) , we see that the effective potential ( [ e50 ] ) will depend on the derivatives of the scalar field now .",
    "it acts as a normal scalar field potential under the conditions of slow rolling or low gradients and in the case the scalar field is near the region @xmath136 .",
    "notice that since @xmath137 , then if @xmath138 , then , as in the simpler model without the curvature squared terms , we obtain that @xmath139 at that point without fine tuning ( here by @xmath140 we mean the derivative of @xmath141 with respect to the scalar field @xmath3 , as usual ) .    in the case of the scale invariant case , where @xmath23 and @xmath22 are given by equation ( [ e19 ] ) , it is interesting to study the shape of @xmath142 as a function of @xmath3 in the case of a constant @xmath3 , in which case @xmath143 can be regarded as a real scalar field potential .",
    "then from ( [ e51 ] ) we get @xmath144 , which inserted in ( [ e50 ] ) gives , @xmath145    the limiting values of @xmath143 are :    first , for asymptotically large positive values , ie . as @xmath146 , we have @xmath147 .",
    "second , for asymptotically large but negative values of the scalar field , that is as @xmath148 , we have : @xmath149 .    in these two asymptotic regions (",
    "@xmath150 and @xmath148 ) an examination of the scalar field equation reveals that a constant scalar field configuration is a solution of the equations , as is of course expected from the flatness of the effective potential in these regions .",
    "notice that in all the above discussion it is fundamental that @xmath151 .",
    "if @xmath152 the potential becomes just a flat one , @xmath153 everywhere ( not only at high values of @xmath154 ) .",
    "all the non trivial features necessary for a graceful exit , the other flat region associated to the planck scale and the minimum at zero if @xmath155 are all lost . as we discussed in the model without a curvature squared term",
    ", @xmath151 implies the we are considering a situation with s.s.b . of scale invariance .",
    "these kind of models with potentials giving rise to two flat potentials have been applied to produce models for bags and confinement in a very natural way @xcite .",
    "one could question the use of the einstein frame metric @xmath127 in contrast to the original metric @xmath156 . in this respect , it is interesting to see the role of both the original metric and that of the einstein frame metric in a canonical approach to the first order formalism .",
    "here we see that the original metric does not have a canonically conjugated momentum ( this turns out to be zero ) , in contrast , the canonically conjugated momentum to the connection turns out to be a function exclusively of @xmath77 , this einstein metric is therefore a genuine dynamical canonical variable , as opposed to the original metric .",

    "we have considered a non - singular origin for the universe starting from an einstein static universe , the so called  emergent universe \" scenario , in the framework of a theory which uses two volume elements @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a metric independent density , used as an additional measure of integration .",
    "also curvature , curvature square terms and for scale invariance a dilaton field @xmath3 are considered in the action .",
    "the first order formalism was applied .",
    "the integration of the equations of motion associated with the new measure gives rise to the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( s.s.b ) of scale invariance ( s.i . ) .",
    "after s.s.b . of s.i .",
    ", using the the einstein frame metric , it is found that a non trivial potential for the dilaton is generated .",
    "one could question the use of the einstein frame metric @xmath127 in contrast to the original metric @xmath156 . in this respect , it is interesting to see the role of both the original metric and that of the einstein frame metric in a canonical approach to the first order formalism .",
    "here we see that the original metric does not have a canonically conjugated momentum ( this turns out to be zero ) , in contrast , the canonically conjugated momentum to the connection turns out to be a function exclusively of @xmath127 , this einstein metric is therefore a genuine dynamical canonical variable , as opposed to the original metric .",
    "there is also a lagrangian formulation of the theory which uses @xmath127 , what we can call the action in the einstein frame . in this frame",
    "we can quantize the theory for example and consider contributions without reference to the original frame , thus possibly considering breaking the tmt structure of the theory , but such breaking will be done  softly \" through the introduction of a cosmological term only .",
    "surprisingly , the remaining structure of the theory , reminiscent from the original tmt structure will be enough to control the strength of this additional cosmological term once we demand that the universe originated from a non - singular and stable emergent state .",
    "in the einstein frame we argue that the cosmological term parametrizes the zero point fluctuations .",
    "the resulting effective potential for the dilaton contains two flat regions , for @xmath4 relevant for the non - singular origin of the universe , followed by an inflationary phase and then transition to @xmath6 , which in this paper we take as describing our present universe .",
    "an intermediate local minimum is obtained if @xmath441 , the region as @xmath393 has a higher energy density than this local minimum and of course of the region @xmath6 , if @xmath217 and @xmath442 .",
    "@xmath217 is also required for satisfactory slow roll in the inflationary region @xmath4 ( after the emergent phase ) .",
    "the dynamics of the scalar field becomes non linear and these non linearities are instrumental in the stability of some of the emergent universe solutions , which exists for a parameter range of values of the vacuum energy in @xmath6 , which must be positive but not very big , avoiding the extreme fine tuning required to keep the vacuum energy density of the present universe small .",
    "a sort of solution of the cosmological constant problem , where an a priori arbitrary cosmological term is restricted by the consideration of the non - singular and stable emergent origin for the universe .",
    "notice then that the creation of the universe can be considered as a  threshold event \" for zero present vacuum energy density , that is a threshold event for @xmath443 and we can learn what we can expect in this case by comparing with well known threshold events .",
    "for example in particle physics , the process @xmath444 , has a cross section of the form ( ignoring the mass of the electron and considering the center of mass frame , @xmath318 being the center of mass energy of each of the colliding @xmath445 or @xmath446 ) ,    @xmath447\\sqrt{\\frac{e^{2}-m_{\\mu}^2 } { e^{2}}}\\ ] ]    for @xmath448 and exactly zero for @xmath449 .",
    "we see that exactly at threshold this cross section is zero , but at this exact point it has a cusp , the derivative is infinite and the function jumps as we slightly increase @xmath318 . by analogy , assuming that the vacuum energy can be tuned somehow ( like the center of mass energy @xmath318 of each of the colliding particles in the case of the annihilation process above ) , we can expect zero probability for exactly zero vacuum energy density @xmath450 , but that soon after we build up any positive @xmath451 we will then able to create the universe , naturally then , there will be a creation process resulting in a universe with a small but positive @xmath451 which represents the total energy density for the region describing the present universe , @xmath6 or by the kinetic vacuum ( which is degenerate with that state ) .",
    "one may ask the question : how is it possible to discuss the  creation of the universe \" in the context of the  emergent universe \" ? . after all",
    ", the emergent universe basic philosophy is that the universe had a past of infinite duration .",
    "however , that most simple notion of an emergent universe with a past of infinite duration has been recently challenged by mithani and vilenkin @xcite , @xcite at least in the context of a special model . they have shown that an emergent universe , although completly stable classically , could be unstable under a tunnelling process to collapse .",
    "on the other hand , an emergent universe can indeed be created from nothing by a tunnelling process as well .",
    "an emerging universe could last for a long time provided it is classically stable , that is where the constraints on the cosmological constant for the late universe discussed here come in .",
    "if it is not stable , the emergent universe will not provide us with an appropriate  intermediate state \" connecting the creation of the universe with the present universe .",
    "the existence of this stable intermediate state provides in our picture the reason for the universe to prefer a very small vacuum energy density at late times , since universes that are created , but do not make use of the intermediate classically stable emergent universe will almost immediately recollapse , so they will not be  selected \" .",
    "finally , it could be that we arrive to the emergent solution not by quantum creation from nothing , by the evolution from something else , for example by the production of a bubble in a pre - existing state @xcite , from here we go on to inflation .",
    "notice that the bound gives a small vacuum energy density , without reference to the threshold mechanism mentioned before . for this notice that upper the bound on the present vacuum energy density of the universe contains a @xmath452 suppression .",
    "if we think of the @xmath453 term as generated through radiative corrections , @xmath115 is indeed formally infinite , in dimensional regularization goes as @xmath454 , @xcite-@xcite so it can have either sign ( depending on how we approach @xmath455 ) . in any case",
    ", a very large @xmath115 means a very strict bound on the present vacuum energy density of the universe .",

    "<S> we consider a non - singular origin for the universe starting from an einstein static universe , the so called  emergent universe \" scenario , in the framework of a theory which uses two volume elements @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a metric independent density , used as an additional measure of integration . also curvature , curvature square terms and for scale invariance a dilaton field @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> are considered in the action . </S>",
    "<S> the first order formalism is applied . </S>",
    "<S> the integration of the equations of motion associated with the new measure gives rise to the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( s.s.b ) of scale invariance ( s.i . ) . </S>",
    "<S> after s.s.b . of s.i . , it is found that a non trivial potential for the dilaton is generated . in the einstein frame </S>",
    "<S> we also add a cosmological term that parametrizes the zero point fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting effective potential for the dilaton contains two flat regions , for @xmath4 relevant for the non - singular origin of the universe , followed by an inflationary phase and @xmath5 , describing our present universe . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the scalar field becomes non linear and these non linearities produce a non trivial vacuum structure for the theory and are responsible for the stability of some of the emergent universe solutions , which exists for a parameter range of values of the vacuum energy in @xmath6 , which must be positive but not very big , avoiding the extreme fine tuning required to keep the vacuum energy density of the present universe small . </S>",
    "<S> the non trivial vacuum structure is crucial to ensure the smooth transition from the emerging phase , to an inflationary phase and finally to the slowly accelerated universe now . </S>",
    "<S> zero vacuum energy density for the present universe defines the threshold for the creation of the universe . </S>"
