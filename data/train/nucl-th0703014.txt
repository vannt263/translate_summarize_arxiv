    "<S> quark - quark double scattering in ea dis and its contribution to quark and anti - quark fragmentation functions are investigated with the generalized factorization of the relevant twist - four processes in pqcd . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the resulting modifications to quark and anti - quark fragmentation functions are different . </S>",
    "<S> while the numerical size of these effects can not be determined from pqcd , the structure of our result leads to a number of qualitative predictions for the relative size of the effect for different hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> these qualitative predictions agree with the multiplicity ratios for positive and negative hadrons as observed by hermes .    ,    and    multiple scattering in a nuclear medium is a key process to understand how hard processes are modified in nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> detailed experimental information , which is available for such diverse reactions as electron - nucleus collisions ( @xmath0 ) in fixed target kinematics and hadron - nucleus collisions ( @xmath1 ) and nucleus - nucleus collisions ( @xmath2 ) at rhic or lhc is confronted by highly advanced theoretical descriptions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> still , however , a truly comprehensive and reliable description of all phenomena has not been reached . in this contribution </S>",
    "<S> we discuss one element which should be contained in such an ultimate theoretical description .    </S>",
    "<S> we analyse @xcite quark - quark double scattering in nuclei and consider the nuclear effects on the quark and anti - quark fragmentation functions ( ff ) , using the generalized factorization theory by lqs @xcite in perturbative qcd . </S>",
    "<S> we find that quark - quark double scattering will give different corrections to quark and anti - quark ff , and obtain qualitative predictions which are in agreement with quite remarkable observation by the hermes collaboration @xcite .    in general </S>",
    "<S> , there are two different kinds of double scattering with nuclear enhancement in ea dis : quark - gluon double scattering and quark - quark double scattering . </S>",
    "<S> quark - gluon double scattering gives the dominant contribution to the leading quark energy loss and has been studied in detailed @xcite , while quark - quark double scattering may mixes quark and gluon fragmentation functions and therefore gives rise to new nuclear effects , as pointed out by wang and guo @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4q - ex](a ) . for the central - cut diagram , </S>",
    "<S> the final parton is a gluon fragmenting into the hadron considered . </S>",
    "<S> for the left - cut or right - cut diagrams , however , the final fragmenting parton is a quark . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , adding up the contributions of these three cut diagrams we will get a mixture of quark and gluon fragmentation functions . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we can see from the central cut of diagram ( a ) that the quark jet is converted into a gluon jet by annihilation with an anti - quark in the nucleus , which provides a mechanism to change the jet flavor @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> for quark - quark double scattering , there are three cut diagrams in leading - order as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4q - ex](a ) , and 46 cut diagrams in next - to - leading order , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4q - ex](b ) @xcite . by summing all these contributions and including virtual corrections we can rewrite the semi - inclusive tensor in terms of a modified fragmentation function taking into account quark - quark double scattering : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the partonic part for single scattering , @xmath5 are the leading - twist quark fragmentation functions in the vacuum , and the @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> are related to the twist - four parton correlation operators @xcite and could be approximated as : @xmath7 c\\ , f_{\\bar q}^n(x_t ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\int_0^{\\mu^2 } \\frac{d\\ell_t^2}{\\ell_t^2 } \\frac{\\alpha_s^2 x_b}{x_a q^2 } \\int_{z_h}^1 \\frac{dz}{z } d_{q \\to h}(\\frac{z_h}{z } ) \\frac{1+z^2}{(1-z)^2_+ } \\nonumber \\frac{c_f}{n_c } [ 1-e^{-x_l^2/x_a^2 } ] c\\ , f_{\\bar q}^n(x_t ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\int_0^{\\mu^2 } \\frac{d\\ell_t^2}{\\ell_t^2 } \\frac{\\alpha_s^2 x_b}{x_a q^2 } \\int_{0}^1 dz d_{q \\to </S>",
    "<S> h}(z_h ) \\frac{1+z^2}{(1-z)^2 } \\nonumber   \\frac{c_f}{n_c } [ 1-e^{-x_l^2/x_a^2 } ] c\\ , f_{\\bar q}^n(x_t)\\ , . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the quark distribution inside a nucleus , @xmath10 is the anti - quark distribution inside a nucleon and @xmath11 is assumed to be a constant , @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the typical transverse momentum carried by the antiquark . if we consider the modification to an anti - quark ff all the calculations are the same with @xmath14 . therefore , we have @xmath15 .    </S>",
    "<S> hermes @xcite has measured the multiplicity ratio @xmath16 , which represents the ratio of the number of hadrons of type @xmath17 produced per dis event for a nuclear target of mass a to that from a deuterium target ( d ) : @xmath18 with @xmath19 the number of semi - inclusive hadrons in a given ( @xmath20)-bin , and @xmath21 the number of inclusive dis positrons in the same @xmath22-bin .    in the constituent quark model , we have @xmath23 , @xmath24 . because the gluon ff for a positive hadron and its antiparticle are the same , and as we are interested only in the difference between the multiplicities of positive hadrons and negative hadrons </S>",
    "<S> , we neglect the contributions from gluon ff and simply assume : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a constituent quark of hadron @xmath17 , and @xmath27 is the number of these constituent quarks .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore we obtain @xmath28 \\ , \\ , , \\label{eq : drm - pion } \\\\ & & \\delta r_m^{p } \\approx   \\delta\\widetilde{d}_{q\\to h}(z,\\nu ) \\propto f_{\\bar q}^n(x_t ) \\,\\ </S>",
    "<S> , , \\delta r_m^{\\bar p } \\approx \\delta\\widetilde{d}_{\\bar q\\to h}(z,\\nu ) \\propto f _ { q}^n(x_t ) \\,\\ </S>",
    "<S> , , \\label{drm - proton } \\\\ & & \\delta r_m^{\\pi^+}(z,\\nu ) \\simeq \\delta r_m^{\\pi^- } \\simeq \\delta r_m^{\\pi^0 } \\,\\ , , \\label{eq : pion - order } \\\\ & & \\delta r_m^{\\bar p}(z,\\nu ) > \\delta </S>",
    "<S> r_m^{p}(z,\\nu ) \\,\\ , . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{eq : proton - order}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    similarly we get @xmath29 the qualitative statements of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : pion - order ] ) , ( [ eq : proton - order ] ) , and ( [ eq : hadron - order ] ) agree with the observations made by the hermes collaboration @xcite . </S>"
