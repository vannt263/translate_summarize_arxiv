    "nucleons are the most common form of hadronic matter on the earth and probably in the whole universe .",
    "understanding their internal structure will give us insight into how the real world works .",
    "an important source of information about the nucleon internal structure is the nucleon excitation spectrum .",
    "our present knowledge on this aspect came almost entirely from partial - wave analyses of @xmath15 total , elastic , and charge - exchange scattering data of more than twenty years ago@xcite . since the late 1970 s , very little has happened in experimental @xmath16 baryon spectroscopy .",
    "considering its importance for the understanding of the baryon structure and for distinguishing various pictures @xcite of the nonperturbative regime of qcd , a new generation of experiments on n * physics with electromagnetic probes have recently been started at new facilities , such as cebaf at jlab , elsa at bonn , graal at grenoble and so on .",
    "one of us , zou suggested @xcite that we can also study @xmath16 baryon in j@xmath17 decay to baryon - antibaryon final states , which provide a new laboratory for study of @xmath16 baryon , especially in the mass range of 1 - 2 gev .",
    "for example , the @xmath18 is an excellent channel to study the @xmath19 state which has a very large decay branching ratio to the @xmath20 @xcite , while other baryon resonances below 2.0 gev do not have a large branching ratio to decay in this channel@xcite , a fact noted very early in the development of the quark shell model @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "based on 7.8 million @xmath0 events collected at bepc , the events for @xmath1 and @xmath2 have been selected and reconstructed .",
    "we perform a partial wave analysis(pwa ) on @xmath21 data in the full mass region of @xmath22(@xmath23 ) .",
    "this is the first pwa study of @xmath16 baryon in @xmath0 hadronic decay in the world .",
    "two s - wave @xmath16 baryon , namely @xmath19 and @xmath24 , are found in their @xmath25 decay mode .",
    "the new information on @xmath26 couplings provides a new source for studying baryon structure .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath27 are detected in their @xmath28 decay modes .",
    "each candidate event is required to have two oppositely signed charged tracks with a good helix fit in the polar angle range @xmath29 in mdc and at least 2 reconstructed @xmath30 s in bsc .",
    "a vertex is required within an interaction region @xmath31 cm longitudinally and 2 cm radially . a minimum energy cut of 60  mev is imposed on the photons .",
    "showers associated with charged tracks are also removed .",
    "after previous selection , we use tof information to identify the @xmath32 pairs , and at least one track with unambiguous tof information is required .",
    "the open angle of two charged tracks smaller than @xmath33 is required in order to remove back to back events ; to remove radiative bhabha events , we require @xmath34 , where @xmath35 , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) are the energy deposited in bsc and momentum of positron ( electron ) respectively .",
    "events are fitted kinematically to the 4c hypotheses @xmath39 .",
    "figure  [ fig : gg ] shows the invariance mass spactrum of the @xmath40 , we can see the clear @xmath27 and @xmath4 signals .",
    "meanwhile , the events are also fitted to @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we require @xmath43 to reject the @xmath44 and @xmath45 backgrounds . in order to improve the mass resolution ,",
    "5c fits are performed on the selected events , the extra constraints are those of the @xmath4 and @xmath27 masses for @xmath6 and @xmath46 decays , respectively .",
    "@xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) is required .",
    "figure  [ fig : ppi0 ] and figure  [ fig : peta ] show the @xmath49 and @xmath22 mass distributions from the decays @xmath1 , @xmath2 respectively .",
    "clear peaks are observed around 1480 mev in @xmath49 invariant mass spectrum .",
    "the @xmath22 events peak strongly in the neighborhood of @xmath4-production threshold , and we shall show that the data require a strong @xmath50 peak near the threshold . there is an additional obvious bump around 1600 - 1700mev , it favors @xmath7 in our @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) partial wave analysis .",
    "a pwa analysis is performed for the @xmath6 channel@xcite with the amplitudes constructed from lorentz - invariant combinations of the momenta and the photon polarization 4-vectors for @xmath0 initial states with helicity @xmath53 .",
    "the relative magnitudes and phases of the amplitudes are determined by a maximum likelihood fit to the data .",
    "based on the study of @xmath32 and @xmath22 invariant mass distributions in our data , the decay chain @xmath6 is analyzed taking into account two @xmath22(@xmath54 ) s - waves(@xmath51 ) and one @xmath22(@xmath54 ) p - wave(@xmath55 ) intermediate processes .",
    "the two s - waves amplitudes are only used to fit the data in the low mass region near the @xmath4 production threshold . while the p - wave is used to fit the data in the high mass region .",
    "the background from multi-@xmath27 is @xmath56 in the 5c fit , we have included a phase space background in the pwa fit to allow for this ; the @xmath22 mass projection fitted to the real data is shown in figure  [ fig : peta ] .",
    "we now discuss the features of the data and the outcome of fits .",
    "a peak at @xmath57 1535 mev near the @xmath4 threshold optimises @xmath58 mev as shown in figure  [ fig : fit](a ) , the data favour @xmath59 over @xmath60 .",
    "a fit with @xmath61 instead gives @xmath62 worse by 16.0 than for @xmath63 assignment(our definition of @xmath64 is such that it increases by 0.5 for a one standard deviation change in one parameter ) . with our 4 fitted parameters , the statistical significance of the peak is above 6.0@xmath65 .",
    "for the width scan as shown in figure  [ fig : fit](b ) , our data require a width , @xmath66 mev .",
    "our results for @xmath19 are consistent with the resonance parameters measured by krusche et al.@xcite at the mami acceletator in mainz on the @xmath4 photoproduction .      at @xmath67 1650 mev ,",
    "there is a further peak .",
    "we fit it with a @xmath68 resonance .",
    "figure  [ fig : fit](c ) are the scan of mass .",
    "its mass optimise at @xmath69 mev with @xmath70 mev fixed to pdg value .",
    "we have tried fits to this peak with resonances having quantum numbers @xmath71 .",
    "we find that log likelihood is better for @xmath63 than @xmath71 by 9.0 . with our 4 fitted parameters ,",
    "the statistical significance of the peak is @xmath72 .",
    "our results for @xmath24 are consistent with the parameters proposed by pdg .",
    "a small improvement to the fit is given by including a @xmath73 resonance , which optimises at @xmath74 mev and @xmath75 mev fixed .",
    "the statistical significance of the peak is only @xmath76 .",
    "we have tried @xmath68 instead @xmath77 , but the fit is much worse .",
    "in summary , we have studied the @xmath21 decay channel , and a pwa analysis is performed on the data .",
    "there is a definite requirement for a @xmath78 component at @xmath79 mev with @xmath80 mev near the threshold for @xmath4 production .",
    "in addition , there is an obvious @xmath7 resonance , with @xmath81 mev and @xmath82 mev fixed to pdg data . in the higher @xmath22 mass region , there is an evidence of @xmath83 signal around 1800 mev , we can not get any conclusion for this state due to the low statistics .",
    "all above analysis is the first step for us to probe @xmath16 baryons at bes .",
    "we will perform detail studies of @xmath16 baryons in the following @xmath0 decay channels : @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and so on .",
