    "giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) in the interstellar medium ( ism ) are generally accepted as the birthplaces of new stars .",
    "the most massive of these new stars produce copious amounts of far ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation which will , in turn , photodissociate the molecular gas of the parent gmcs , producing `` blankets '' of hi ( and other atomic species ) on their surfaces . @xcite",
    "were the first to present evidence that major features in the hi distribution of the nearby spiral galaxy m83 ( ngc 5236 ) , namely , the inner hi spiral arms observed with the very large array ( vla ) , were the result of photodissociation of @xmath7  on galactic scales .",
    "@xcite confirmed that hi features existed in m81 ( ngc 3031 ) on scales of @xmath8 pc which were qualitatively consistent with the expected morphology of large , low density photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) , and explicitly related those hi features to nearby bright sources of far - uv ( fuv ) radiation found on images of the galaxy from the ultraviolet imaging telescope ( uit ) .",
    "@xcite used a simple , but quantitative , model for the equilibrium physics of photodissociation regions and applied it to vla - hi and uit - fuv observations of m101 ( ngc 5457 ) .",
    "their work showed that this approach provides an entirely new method for determining the volume density of molecular gas in star - forming gmcs of galaxies , a method which is no longer dependent on the ( often poorly known ) excitation conditions for line emission by specific molecular tracers .",
    "in this paper we return to another spiral galaxy , m81 , and carry out a quantitative analysis of the gmcs in this galaxy using the methods described by @xcite .",
    "this new analysis has been made possible by new data on m81 which was not available to @xcite ; new , higher - resolution , high - sensitivity vla - hi observations , and sensitive new fuv imagery from the galex satellite .",
    "we have also sought an independent verification that the very basis of our approach is valid , namely , that the hi in the immediate vicinity of fuv concentrations is indeed produced in pdrs . to this end",
    "we have examined the spitzer / irac data on m81 for evidence of mid - ir emission by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) which are also thought to be tracers of pdrs .",
    "m81 has been probed extensively for the molecular tracer co. no global co map of m81 has been published to this date , and the detected co emission is found to be very weak and spotty ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . since pdrs also produce co emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , comparing the co results to the results in this paper is therefore of considerable interest .",

    "we hypothesize that this source ( a cluster of young stars ) creates a photon dominated region , in which molecular hydrogen is converted into atomic hydrogen .",
    "while the exact morphology of these regions remains unclear , the distribution of hi suggests that large scale photodissociation is taking place .",
    "the presence of pah emission in these regions reinforces this picture .",
    "we selected 27 sources based on their well - defined compact fuv emission , from faint to bright .",
    "the sources were chosen to have a range of galactocentric radii , although we suspect that all candidate pdrs should have similar total hydrogen densities regardless of their location @xcite .",
    "it is significant that we found no sources of this type within @xmath31 and brighter than our faintest source of @xmath32 @xmath33 ergs @xmath23 s@xmath34 @xmath34 .",
    "there is one source at a smaller radius that has a similar fuv flux as our faintest source , but it is extended and has a lower contrast than our faintest source . the locations of these sources are shown in figure [ fig : locplot ] and given in table [ tab : fuvfluxes ] .",
    "four example sources are shown in figure [ fig : panels ] .",
    "these sources vary in fuv flux and galactocentric distance .",
    "each source shows the general structure of a uv source surrounded or bordered by hi with pah emission nearby . at larger scales this is clearly visible , see @xcite , or @xcite for similar plots of m101 .",
    "the fuv source flux is determined first .",
    "we correct for galactic foreground extinction , but not for internal extinction .",
    "we decided against applying an internal extinction correction , despite the availability of internal extinction data @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the height of m81 s gas disk is of the same order as the size of the pdrs to which our method is most sensitive .",
    "@xcite use a gas disk half height of up to 450 pc , which is comparable to the size of our candidate pdrs . in that case",
    "the extinction from the hi patch to the uv source is the same as the extinction of the uv source in m81 s disk towards the line of sight of the observer . under these circumstances , the corresponding extinction corrections to the uv flux",
    "cancel each other out .",
    "using the internal extinction correction is therefore unnecessary .",
    "the radius at which the uv emission blends into the background radiation level determines the size of the uv source on the image and the place to measure the background .",
    "the total fuv flux within this radius is calculated and the background flux is subtracted .",
    "typically , the net flux is 50% of the total fuv flux .",
    "for comparison , we calculate the contrast of the source above the background level , which we define as the incident uv flux on the hi patches @xmath35 ( the unscaled @xmath4 ) divided by the incident background uv flux @xmath36 .",
    "the latter is defined as the uv background surface brightness at the edge of the aperture of the uv source , integrated over half the sky ( a flux on a semi - infinite slab ) .",
    "only the net flux of the source is used to calculate @xmath4 , since the model does not include calculating hi produced by the ambient uv background .",
    "the measured flux is in ergs @xmath23  s@xmath34  @xmath34 .",
    "the distance @xmath27 from the uv source position to any surrounding patches ( concentrations ) of hi is measured next , along with the column density of each such patch .",
    "a patch of hi is identified as a local maximum in column density .",
    "see figure [ fig : panels ] , middle panels .",
    "this procedure differs slightly from that of @xcite , who took the first local maximum of the ring averaged hi column densities around uv sources as a probe of the true hi column density .",
    "in fact , any local bright spot in atomic hydrogen is an equally valid probe of a potential pdr .",
    "they are all likely to be direct views onto the surfaces of molecular clouds surrounding the uv source . in that case , the hi local maxima are a measure of the true local column density and each measurement represents ( part of ) an hi cloud . for this reason we decided to use more than one measurement of the hi surrounding the uv source .",
    "we subtract a general background level of hi emission that we assume has either not been created by photodissociation , or that has been created by the general uv background radiation field acting on all gmcs in the area .",
    "in addition to identifying individual hi concentrations , the maximum measured column densities per 1 kpc galactocentric bin are recorded and compared to the ring - averaged values from m81 s radial profile .",
    "dividing the maximum column densities per bin of individual hi clouds , converted to @xmath37 pc@xmath38 , by the average surface density per 1 kpc bin from m81 s radial profile yields a filling factor . in the framework of the derived pdr model ,",
    "this filling factor is an estimate of the extent to which gmcs fill m81 s disk .    in order to determine @xmath27",
    ", we corrected for m81 s inclination and position angle assuming m81 s disk to be intrinsically circular ( see figure [ fig : himethods]a ) . from this , the incident flux @xmath4  on each surrounding hi patch is computed using equation [ eqn : g0 ] . the relevant dust - to - gas ratio at the galactocentric radius of each uv source is taken from figure [ fig : dust ] . the extinction between m81 and the observer is taken to be 1.37 mag at 1500  , after @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the measured fuv flux is increased accordingly when calculating @xmath4 .",
    "the incident flux @xmath4 , the hi column density and the dust - to - gas ratio @xmath11  finally yields a total hydrogen volume density for each patch according to equation [ eqn : n ] .",
    "note that this probe for molecular gas does not yield any information about the geometry of the gas clouds , but deep inside the gmc all available hydrogen is likely to be in the form of molecular hydrogen , so @xmath39 .",
    "a pah map was obtained by subtracting a scaled and smoothed version of the 3.6 @xmath18 m m81 image from the 8 @xmath18 m m81 image , as described by @xcite .",
    "this procedure assumes that the 3.6 @xmath18 m image contains purely stellar emission , while the 8 @xmath18 m image contains a mix of stellar and pah emission .",
    "we determined the required scale factor empirically , by comparing four regions of m81 encompassing most of our candidate pdrs .",
    "correlation maps of individual pixels were used to determine the slope of the appropriate correlated component .",
    "our four scale factors are consistent with the single one used by @xcite , being within a range of 0.7 and 1 .",
    "seven sources were not included in these four regions ; these sources have comparatively large galactocentric radii and any 3.6 @xmath18 m contribution is negligible . in these cases",
    "we therefore used the raw 8 @xmath18 m image .",
    "the relevance of the detected pah emission around the candidate pdr was tested by checking for the presence of pah emission near the location of the uv source and determining the separation between pah emission peaks and hi patches .    summarizing : determining @xmath22 , @xmath27 , @xmath40 and @xmath11  yields @xmath19 , derived using the picture of photodissociation .",
    "additionally , the presence of pah emission reinforces the photodissocation assumption .",
    "in this section , we present total hydrogen volume densities of the 27 candidate pdrs . table [ tab : fuvfluxes ] lists the fuv fluxes of the central ( cluster of ) sources . table [ tab : nhi ] lists the corresponding hi column density measurements , the resulting incident fluxes and finally the total hydrogen volume densities .",
    "first , we ll discuss the hi measurements , followed by the fuv results .",
    "these results , combined with the appropriate dust - to - gas ratio from equation [ eqn : dd0 ] , are then used to calculate @xmath19 . at the end of this section",
    ", we discuss the spatial correlation between hi and pahs in m81 .",
    "each region can have one or more hi measurements , as was explained in the previous section .",
    "the resulting hi column densities and their distance to the central fuv source are listed in table [ tab : nhi ] .",
    "figure [ fig : rnorm_hi ] shows the hi column densities of all hi patches from table [ tab : nhi ] as a function of ( normalized ) galactocentric radius .",
    "the general background column density level is of the order of 1 @xmath41 @xmath23 and has been subtracted from all measured values , for reasons mentioned above ( section [ sec : method ] ) . very little hi radio emission is observed within a radius of 3 kpc of the center of m81",
    ". the hi column densities rise with increasing galactocentric radius from 0.3 to 0.6 @xmath42 ( 3.8 kpc to 7.5 kpc ) , although there is significant scatter .    while the general morphology of our candidate pdrs is the same ( fuv emission surrounded by atomic hydrogen ) , the actual geometry of the gmcs can not be discerned at the available resolution .",
    "the hi structures are barely resolved , which makes it practically impossible to deal with projection effects properly .",
    "this introduces inaccuracies in the determination of @xmath27 ( figure [ fig : rnorm_rho ] , discussed below ) and @xmath22 .",
    "we can not include hi patches closer than about 20 pc ( roughly the size of one pixel ) , or right on top of a uv source , even though they could have a significant separation in the vertical direction .",
    "the model can not take a @xmath27 of 0 .",
    "we had to reject only one hi patch because it was too close to the uv source .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath27 ( about 600 pc ) is somewhat arbitrary and dependent on the maximum separation that could still conceivably have hi connected to a certain uv source . in combination with the lowest measured fuv flux ,",
    "the resulting @xmath4  would be 0.01 .",
    "we corrected for m81 s inclination and position angle ( figure [ fig : himethods]a ) , assuming m81 s disk to be perfectly circular in shape .",
    "this means we used ellipses to measure the deprojected separation between the fuv source and the associated hi patches .",
    "however , @xmath27 is still sensitive to projection effects , as illustrated in figure [ fig : himethods]b .",
    "it shows how the measured separation could further be deprojected if we knew the position of all hi patches in the z - direction of the disk of m81 .",
    "therefore , the measured separation @xmath27 is close to , but not exactly equal to the real separation .",
    "this will lead to underestimating the separation between the uv source and its associated hi patches .",
    "this in turn will mean overestimating @xmath4  and therefore overestimating @xmath19 as well .",
