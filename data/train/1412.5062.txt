    "@xcite brings to light some new aspects of the catastrophe transition . contradicting the long - standing view that ( in the absence of depolymerizing proteins ) a filament is equally likely to undergo catastrophe at any instant of time ,",
    "it was observed that the probability of a microtubule to undergo catastrophe depends on how long it has been growing ; the older the microtubule is , the higher the probability to undergo switching .",
    "irrespective of tubulin concentration , the measured catastrophe frequency exhibited a nonlinear dependence on the age of the microtubule , increasing linearly during the early stage of growth and then approaching a steady state ( fig .",
    "3.e of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . also , the presence of depolymerizing proteins was observed to affect the aging process ; for example , kip3p accelerated the rate of aging while in the presence of mcak , catastrophe was observed to become a first order process . until this observation was made ,",
    "it was generally believed that microtubule catastrophe is a single step stochastic event with no memory associated with it and hence usually modeled as a first order process . within this frame work",
    ", many theoretical models have been set up in an attempt to understand the intrinsic dynamics of microtubules @xcite .",
    "it has been shown by verde et al .",
    "@xcite , the microtubule length distribution follows a simple exponential decay in the bounded growth regime , when the switching rates are constants .",
    "available experimental and simulation studies suggest that the origin of the aging phenomenon lies in the multi - filament structure of a microtubule @xcite .",
    "a microtubule typically consists of 13 - 14 protofilaments wrapped into a cylindrical structure . during the early stages of growth ,",
    "when all the protofilaments are of nearly equal length , the entire filament is structurally stable because of strong lateral bonding between protofilaments .",
    "as the filament grows longer , the tip of the microtubule becomes more and more tapered , weakening the lateral bonding between protofilaments and makes the filament more susceptible to undergo catastrophe .",
    "in this view , the `` structural defects '' responsible for the switching of the filament grows with time , until finally the filament undergoes catastrophe .",
    "an alternate view is that catastrophe requires the loss of guanosine triphosphate ( gtp ) tip in a minimum number of protofilaments , and hence its kinetics could be visualized as a multi - step process , each step requiring the completion of the previous one for its materialization @xcite .",
    "the possibility that the kinetics of plus end in microtubule dynamics may be non - first order was suggested first by odde et al .",
    "nearly two decades ago @xcite , and more recently by stepanova et al .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on a probabilistic analysis of the experimentally observed growth time distributions , the authors showed that the plus and minus ends of a microtubule follow different kinetics .",
    "for the minus end , the growth time distribution could be described as exponential decay , characteristic of first order kinetics , whereas for the plus end , it turned out to be non - exponential ; the experimental data in this case fitted well to gamma distribution .",
    "since the gamma distribution characterizes a multi step process , it was inferred that a growing microtubule ( at the plus end ) has to go through a sequence of events in order that catastrophe occurs .",
    "a new parameter was introduced to describe dynamic instability , apart from @xmath0 ( catastrophe frequency ) , @xmath1 ( rescue frequency ) , @xmath2 ( growth velocity ) and @xmath3 ( shrinking velocity ) , viz .",
    ", the shape parameter @xmath4 of the growth time ( or equivalently , time until catastrophe , hence also called catastrophe time ) distribution ( gamma distribution ) .",
    "the value of the shape parameter that gave reasonably good fit with the experimental data is @xmath5 suggesting that catastrophe take place in a series of three steps , with each individual step being characterized by rate constant @xmath6 .",
    "later , odde and buettner @xcite showed that oscillations in state ( growth / shrinkage ) arise as a natural consequence of non - first order kinetics of catastrophe and rescue processes .    in the present paper ,",
    "we develop a mathematical model of dynamic instability , wherein the evolution of catastrophe frequency with the age of the filament is explicitly taken into account . motivated by experimental observations of gardner et al.@xcite , we assume here that age - dependent catastrophe frequency is given by the phenomenological expression    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the asymptotic value , @xmath9",
    "is referred to as the aging rate , with @xmath10 being the _ age _ , the time spent by the filament in the growing state after the last rescue event . in this sense , we assume the age of a filament as being given by an internal clock in the filament , the reading of which is reset to zero at every catastrophe , and which starts `` ticking '' as soon as rescue happens . for simplicity , and for lack of strong evidence to the contrary , we assume that rescue events follow first - order kinetics characterized by rate @xmath1 . a fit of eq.[eq : eq1 ] to the experimental data in @xcite is shown in fig .",

    "a similar , but not exactly identical , mathematical form for aging of catastrophe also emerges naturally within a recently proposed model@xcite where the transition is modeled as a first passage process , such that a threshold number of protofilaments are required to lose their individual gtp tips by hydrolysis for it to happen . for details ,",
    "we refer the reader to supplementary information @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , by comparison , it is assumed that the catastrophe time distribution ( to be discussed in sec .",
    "ii ) is represented by gamma distribution , similar to @xcite . here too , the catastrophe transition is visualized as a first passage event , and requires the occurrence of a threshold number @xmath4 of underlying events , but each event is assumed to occur with the _ same _ rate @xmath15 . in this case , the precise nature of the underlying events is not specified in detail . both the exponential aging function in eq.[eq : eq1 ] as well as the corresponding function derived from the gamma distribution fit the experimental data almost equally well ; see fig . 1 in supplemental material @xcite",
    ".    a brief summary of our results are as follows : as a direct consequence of eq.[eq : eq1 ] , the distribution of time intervals corresponding to the growth phase is found to be non - monotonic ( section ii ) .",
    "the fokker - planck equations for microtubule dynamics in the presence of aging ( set up in sec .",
    "iii ) lead to a number of analytical results , presented in sec .",
    "iv . in particular , the stationary length distribution is non - exponential , approaching half - gaussian form in the limit @xmath16 , while the standard exponential decay is recovered in the limit @xmath17 .",
    "exact mathematical expressions for length autocorrelation function are derived in laplace space , but in general , explicit inversion is found difficult . numerical simulations ( sec .",

    "numerically computed velocity autocorrelation function also shows similar properties . for near - experimental parameter values , the half - period of length oscillations is found to be in the range of @xmath20 minutes . in this context",
    ", we also make a comparison with experimental observations on chromosome oscillations in the concluding section ( sec .",
    "in this paper , we introduce the age of the filament @xmath10 as a variable that describes the state of a growing filament ( in addition to its length ) irrespective of the origins of the aging effect . although rescue events are not reported in the experiments by gardner et al .",
    "@xcite , here we take a step a forward : we assume that if rescue events are present , after every rescue , a filament starts to grow as a fresh filament without any structural defects .",
    "age is reset to zero at each catastrophe event , which again starts to grow linearly with time upon the rescue of the filament .",
    "since our objective is to explore the consequences of age - dependent catastrophe on dynamic instability , we do not consider explicitly microscopic events such as addition / removal of monomers and hydrolysis ; these enter the formalism implicitly through catastrophe and rescue rates@xcite .",
    "in the present study , we use the two state continuum approach model proposed by verde et al .",

    "also , increasing @xmath1 lifts up the negative lobe , weakening the oscillations .",
    "interestingly , a comparison with fig.[fig : fig9 ] reveals that , for the same value of @xmath9 , the threshold rescue frequency for disappearance of oscillations is higher for velocity autocorrelation when compared to length , implying that for a certain range of parameter values , direction reversals are more regularly spaced in time when compared to excursions of length above and below the mean .",
    "our results for velocity / state correlation are similar to the results reported by odde and buettner @xcite . in this paper , the authors modeled dynamic instability as a two state jump process , but switching from one state to another state takes place in a sequence of steps such that residence times in both the states are characterized by ( identical ) gamma - distributions .",
    "qualitatively , the effects of age - dependent ( studied here ) and multi - step ( studied in ref.@xcite ) catastrophes are similar ; however , in our model , only catastrophe is assumed to be age - dependent while rescue is treated as a first order process .",
    "motivated by recent experimental observations on  aging \" in microtubule catastrophe , in this paper , we have formulated a mathematical model to investigate how the statistical properties of a microtubule population gets modified by it .",
    "aging is characterized by a parameter @xmath9 , with units of inverse time , which we refer to as the aging rate in our model .",
    "our results show that aging affects statistical properties of a microtubule population in important ways .",
    "the steady state length distribution is no longer a simple exponential decay as in the constant catastrophe case , while the condition for its existence is altered .",
    "the length and velocity autocorrelation functions develop a negative lobe for sufficiently small aging and rescue rates , which signifies oscillatory dynamics in the population .",
    "we characterized the oscillations using analytical calculations and scaling arguments , and checked their consistency with numerical simulations .",
    "velocity ( or growth state ) oscillations in microtubule dynamics were studied earlier by odde and buettner @xcite using a model with _",
    "identical _ gamma - distributed residence times in each state ( i.e , both catastrophe and rescue were assumed to undergo aging in a similar way ) .",
    "our study is similar in spirit , but with the following differences : ( i ) two different forms of aging are used for catastrophe , while rescue is treated as a first order process ( in the absence of evidence to the contrary ) ( ii ) we study how the steady state length distribution is modified in the presence of aging ( iii ) the length autocorrelation function is studied in detail , and we have derived an explicit mathematical expression for the same ( in the linear aging model ) in laplace space .",
    "microtubule length oscillations are likely to be relevant in the context of the well - known phenomenon of chromosome oscillations , although the latter is certainly a more complex process involving many other proteins and regulatory mechanisms .",
    "nevertheless , we feel that it is interesting to make a broad comparison of our results with experimental observations on chromosome oscillations . in eukaryotic cells , soon after the onset of mitosis , each chromosome pair exists in a  mono - oriented \"",
    "state for a while , i.e. , pulled / pushed only from one side of the mitotic spindle @xcite by microtubules attached to it through macromolecular structures called kinetochores .",
    "a successful and efficient mitosis requires all the chromosomes to be  bi - oriented \" ( i.e. , bound to microtubule bundles emanating from the opposite poles simultaneously ) at the spindle equator before segregation .",
    "it is known from experimental observations that both mono - oriented and bi - oriented chromosomes undergo regular oscillatory motion .",
    "skibbens et al .",
    "@xcite have showed that mono - oriented chromosomes in newt lung cells exhibit non - sinusoidal oscillatory motion with a time period of @xmath189s .",
    "similar oscillations were also observed in bi - oriented chromosomes , with a smaller period . in ptk1 cells , the to and fro motion in mono - oriented chromosomes were observed to last for @xmath190 @xcite , but the observed motion does not show the same degree of regularity as in the previous example . in hela cells ,",
    "the autocorrelation function of translational movement of sister - kinetochores was experimentally measured more recently ; the half - period of oscillations , measured as the position of the first minimum was found to be in the range @xmath191 @xcite . with the available information , it is unclear whether aging and related effects in microtubule catastrophe plays a role in these phenomena ; however , given the fact that the observed period of oscillations of mono - oriented chromosomes @xcite is close to the what was found in our simulations ( fig.[fig : fig10 ] ) , we feel that further investigations in this direction could be worthwhile .",
