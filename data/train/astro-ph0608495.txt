    "@xmath2-body simulations of cdm satellites indicate that tightly bound cusps are very stable against tidal stripping ( kazantzidis et al . 2004 ) , and therefore dense micro - haloes accreting late onto more massive structures may survive relatively intact .",

    "substructures that survive the merging process will experience continuous perturbative encounters with stars , molecular clouds , and other dark matter subhaloes . as discussed in @xcite , we expect that these encounters lead to some mass loss but that the cusps of most micro - haloes remain intact .",
    "recent studies by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have raised the question whether these first haloes would be completely disrupted by close encounters with stars .",
    "crossing the galactic disc would also cause additional tidal heating .",

    ", we use several sets of high resolution @xmath2-body simulations to test the validity of analytical heating models .",
    "an important factor in the survival statistics of micro - haloes is how many survive similar - mass mergers during the build - up of the galactic halo @xcite .",
    "even if only a few percent survive the hierarchical growth , many micro - haloes would still lie within one parsec from the sun .",

    "there are various ways to define a virialized halo .",

    "the virial velocity is defined by the relation @xmath13 : @xmath14 these parameters determine the binding energy of the haloes , which can be expressed using the half - mass radius of the system : @xmath15 @xcite .",

    "the radius containing half of the virial mass is approximately @xmath18 .",
    "high - redshift haloes have typically low concentrations , such that @xmath19 . therefore , the binding energy of first haloes is @xmath20 .",
    "as these small haloes merge into larger systems , two effects may modify their structure : tidal truncation by the host galaxy and tidal heating by massive , fast - moving perturbers ( stars , molecular clouds , other dark matter substructures ) .    in the vicinity of the sun ,",
    "the matter density is dominated by stars , which we assume to have the same mass @xmath21 .",

    "self - bound , the micro - haloes must have an average density above roughly @xmath24 .",
    "fast encounters with massive perturbers increase the velocity dispersion of dark matter particles and reduce a halo s binding energy .",

    ", a single encounter would be sufficiently strong to unbind the whole halo : @xmath30 . as we show later in section [ sec : num ] , a small central part always survives even such a strong perturbation , apart from direct collisions with @xmath31 . nevertheless , it is instructive to define the disruptive encounter threshold , which is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",

    "we can obtain the cumulative effect of multiple non - disruptive encounters by integrating over the impact parameter : @xmath40 the upper limit of integration is set by the condition that the encounter is impulsive , i.e. the duration of the encounter @xmath41 is shorter than the orbital time of particles in the halo , @xmath42 .",

    "the total disruption probability , @xmath46 , is then twice that given by equation ( [ eq : etideb ] ) .    to calculate this disruption probability",
    ", we note that while stars in the solar neighbourhood move on approximately circular orbits around the galactic centre , small dark matter haloes would be moving on isotropic orbits inclined with respect to the galactic disc .",

    "the crossing time of the disc with a scale height of @xmath49 kpc is @xmath50 yr . in the solar neighbourhood , haloes would cross the disc every @xmath51 yr and have about 100 crossings in the hubble time . the total amount of time the haloes would spend in the region of high stellar density @xmath52",
    "is then @xmath53 yr . the total disruption probability is @xmath54 therefore , the haloes virialized after redshift @xmath55 should suffer significant mass loss by passing stars in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "due to biased halo formation typical subhaloes in the solar neighbourhood come form @xmath56 fluctuations ( diemand , madau & moore 2005 ) , i.e. they virialize at half the expansion factor ( or twice the ( z + 1 ) value ) than typical haloes of the same mass in the field ( i.e. @xmath57 peaks ) . a formation time of z = 130 corresponds to about a @xmath58 peak .",
    "such early structure formation is not uncommon in dense environments , for example the small , over dense region simulated in diemand , kuhlen & madau ( 2006 ) already contains 845 micro - haloes at z = 130 .",
    "a fraction of about 20% of the local mass comes from peaks above @xmath59 ( diemand , madau & moore 2005 ) , implying that approximately 20% of the local subhalo population should therefore not suffer significant mass loss .",
    "virialized , self - gravitating subhaloes within larger haloes ( the substructure ) will also kinematically heat and disrupt their small cousins [ c.f .",

    "tidal approximation applies only at @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , most encounters will be non - disruptive .",
    "the cumulative heating by multiple non - disruptive encounters with subhaloes of mass @xmath71 is [ see equation ( [ eq : etid ] ) ] : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the number density of subhaloes @xmath65 .",

    ". therefore the typical local subhalo might be twice as concentrated and more robust against mass loss .",
    "however , to be conservative we use the low concentration of 1.6 throughout this paper unless stated otherwise . for numerical stability of the profile",

    "then we remove the star and let the system evolve in isolation for @xmath104 yr , which corresponds to 20 crossing times of the halo .",
    "similar experiments date back to e. g. @xcite .",

    "<S> if the dark matter particle is a neutralino then the first structures to form are cuspy cold dark matter ( cdm ) haloes collapsing after redshifts @xmath0 in the mass range @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we carry out a detailed study of the survival of these micro - haloes in the galaxy as they experience tidal encounters with stars , molecular clouds , and other dark matter substructures . </S>",
    "<S> we test the validity of analytic impulsive heating calculations using high resolution @xmath2-body simulations . </S>",
    "<S> a major limitation of analytic estimates is that mean energy inputs are compared to mean binding energies , instead of the actual mass lost from the system . </S>",
    "<S> this energy criterion leads to an overestimate of the stripped mass and underestimate of the disruption timescale since cdm haloes are strongly bound in their inner parts . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a significant fraction of material from cdm micro - haloes can be unbound by encounters with galactic substructure and stars , however the cuspy central regions remain relatively intact . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the micro - haloes near the solar radius are those which collapse significantly earlier than average and will suffer very little mass loss . </S>",
    "<S> thus we expect a fraction of surviving bound micro - haloes , a smooth component with narrow features in phase space , which may be uncovered by direct detection experiments , as well as numerous surviving cuspy cores with proper motions of arc - minutes per year , which can be detected indirectly via their annihilation into gamma - rays .    </S>",
