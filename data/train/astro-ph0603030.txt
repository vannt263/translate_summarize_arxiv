    "energy photons from the extragalactic infrared background ( @xmath5 ) and produce electron  positron pairs ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the total absorption depends on the history of the reaction rate along the line  of  sight , and therefore , on the distance travelled and on the local density of the low - energy target photon field , both a function of redshift @xmath7",
    ". this process will affect the high  energy tev end of the observed blazar spectra . since the optical depth depends strongly on the incident tev ",
    "photon energy the process leads to a steepening of the observed spectrum with respect to the intrinsic ( unabsorbed ) one .",
    "thus , the observed spectra from distant blazars contain information on both the ir background radiation field history and the intrinsic properties of the source . from the viewpoint of blazar studies",
    "the latter is just an undesirable extrinsic effect that must be corrected for .",
    "in contrast , from the opposite perspective , it allows the measurement of the ir background . in both cases",
    "these two independent processes have to be disentangled by either modeling both simultaneously ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , or measuring one independently ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "unfortunately it proved very difficult to constrain the ir background independently , and different groups tried to constrain models for the ir background from tev observations _ assuming _ that the blazar spectrum is a well - behaved power",
    " law ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the best perspective for such studies is offered by high ",
    "redshift blazars , since the absorption will be strong .",
    "recently , @xcite presented a study along these lines , based on the tev spectra of high  redshift blazars recently measured by the h.e.s.s .",
    "they de  reddened the observed tev data of 1es  1101 - 232 with different models of the ir backgrounds , and concluded that the resulting intrinsic spectrum is _ always _ very hard .",
    "the index of the intrinsic spectrum should be equal to @xmath8 if the level of the ir background is close to the absolute lower limit obtained from direct integration of the light from resolved galaxies @xcite .",
    "larger ir background levels should correspond to intrinsic tev spectra harder than @xmath8 . note that this spectral index is already harder than the spectral index observed in other nearby tev sources and that the difference will be more important for larger background levels .",
    "@xcite also commented on the theoretical difficulties to explain spectra harder than @xmath8 , which would imply quite unexpected physics .",
    "these facts led @xcite to prefer the solution of minimal ir background .    in this paper",
    "we show instead that spectra harder than @xmath8 can be obtained in ",
    "normal \" one  zone homogeneous synchrotron self ",
    "compton ( ssc ) models , as long as there is a deficit of low energy electrons with respect to the extrapolation from higher energies .",
    "this can be achieved by assuming an emitting particle distribution which is a double power law , with a flat slope ( @xmath9 ) of the first , low energy portion , or assuming a simple power law , but with a relatively high low energy cut  off . in these cases",
    "the limits on how hard a tev spectrum can be is @xmath10 , while well accounting for a much softer x  ray spectrum .",
    "we discuss this result with the aim of finding limits on the ir background and also in the context of explaining the other tev sources ( with a softer intrinsic spectrum ) with the same model .",
    "the simplest possible scenario able to explain the x  ray and tev emission of a blazar assumes a homogeneous , spherical source filled by tangled magnetic field and relativistic electrons .    since in tev blazars",
    "we must have electrons of very large energies , the scattering process occurs partly in the klein  nishina regime . in this regime",
    "the scattering process becomes inefficient , and for typical electron distributions the ssc process can be well described by approximating the scattering cross section with a step function , equal to the thomson cross section for incident photon energies @xmath11 , and zero otherwise .",
    "this means that electrons of increasingly large energies scatter an increasingly smaller fraction of synchrotron seed photons , steepening the resulting ssc spectrum with respect to the  canonical \" value of @xmath12 .",
    "note that this steepening introduced by the klein ",
    "nishina effects is virtually inescapable , since the scattering occurs completely in the thomson limit only for extremely large values of the beaming factor : @xmath13 ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in the next section",
    "we will find what is the high energy spectral index corresponding to a given particle energy distribution , assuming  usual \" parameters for our tev source , namely : source radius @xmath14 [ cm ] , magnetic field intensity @xmath15 [ g ] , doppler factor @xmath16 and approximating the particle energy distribution by a broken power law with the index @xmath17 [ @xmath18 below the break energy ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 above the break [ @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the density of the particles with @xmath23 .",
    "if the minimal @xmath24 is greater than unity ( @xmath25 ) the density of the particles with minimum energy ( @xmath26 ) is given by @xmath27 .",
    "a flat slope of the electron distribution ( @xmath28 ) may help to explain the intrinsic tev spectrum of 1es 1101232 .",
    "assuming the lowest possible absorption level , @xcite have estimated the intrinsic spectral index @xmath29 for this particular source .",
    "we verified that it is roughly possible to reproduce such a spectrum if we assume that @xmath30 ( note that in the thomson limit @xmath8 would correspond to @xmath31 . ) . in this case , however , we do not obtain a power law intrinsic tev spectrum .",
    "the spectrum is curved , with @xmath32 changing from @xmath33 in the gev range to @xmath34 at the peak of the emission at a few tev .",
    "since @xmath30 can explain the spectrum derived for the minimal ir background case , we then ask if a smaller value of @xmath17 , producing an harder spectrum , can allow for a larger level of the ir background . in fig .",
    "[ fig_n1 t ] we show different synchrotron and inverse  compton spectra for different @xmath17 indices .",
    "the spectral index of the first part of the thin synchrotron emission ( @xmath35 ) depends directly on @xmath17 [ @xmath36 down to the limiting value @xmath37 . below this limit",
    "the index remains constant @xmath38 .",
    "this is due the fact that , below the limit , the dominant part of the low frequency emission is generated by electrons with @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , the spectrum in the discussed range is equivalent to the spectrum produced by a monoenergetic population of electrons , which can be approximated by a power law with @xmath10 below the maximum of the emission ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this means that even in the extreme case of the truncated , single power law energy distribution ( @xmath40 ) there is always a `` source '' of low energy photons due to the low frequency emission ( @xmath41 ) of the high energy electrons ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the spectral index of the inverse  compton emission in the thompson regime is equivalent to the index of the target radiation field ( e.g. @xcite ) . since @xmath35 is limited to 1/3 also the index of the inverse ",
    "compton emission below the peak is limited to this value . moreover ,",
    "this index does not depend on @xmath20 .",
    "the index of the inverse ",
    "compton emission above the peak is given by @xmath42 , where @xmath43 .",
    "this relationship can be easily derived from the approximation of the scattering derived by @xcite .    to directly check the applicability of the ssc scenario that assumes @xmath44",
    "we have applied our computations to the emission of 1es  1101232 observed by @xmath45sax @xcite and h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite experiments .",
    "the tev data ( here and in all the other cases in the following ) have been unabsorbed according to the `` best - fit '' model proposed recently by @xcite .",
    "the predictions of this model are also consistent with those of the model proposed by @xcite .",
    "the model provides a significantly stronger absorption level than the minimal possible absorption suggested by @xcite .",
    "however , our best fit for the expected intrinsic spectrum , in a framework of the above mentioned ssc scenario , has been obtained for the limiting case ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "this indicates that the absorption is close to the highest possible value that can be accommodated by this scenario .",
    "if the absorption is stronger , as suggested by some models ( e.g. @xcite ) , then our ssc scenario can not explain the intrinsic tev emission of 1es  1101232 .",
    "the detailed values of the physical parameters used in our computations are discussed in the last section of this work , where we apply this scenario also to other sources .",
    "the truncated particle energy distribution corresponds to the limit @xmath46 of a broken power law . for clarity",
    ", we will refer in the following to the break energy as @xmath47 .",
    "for such a electron distribution , the shape of the tev emission depends strongly on @xmath47 , and we will therefore investigate this is some detail .      as we have shown in the previous subsection a particle distribution with a low energy cut - off provides the best explanation for the emission of 1es  1101232 .",
    "we here show the effects of changing the value of the low energy cut  off , which we will call @xmath47 .",
    "the result of our calculations is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_gmt ] .",
    "we have applied this test for the @xmath45sax @xcite and cat @xcite observations of mrk  501 from 16@xmath48 april , 1997 .    for this test",
    ", we fix the slope of the particle distribution to @xmath49 , which provides the best fit for the used x ",
    "ray observations of mrk  501 . in the first approach",
    "we assume the minimal possible value of @xmath50 .",
    "this means that the model is equivalent to the standard ssc scenario and is providing a relatively broad peak for the inverse ",
    "compton emission . nevertheless , this approach is able to roughly explain the unabsorbed tev spectrum .",
    "however , the increase of the @xmath47 value by about three orders of magnitude provides a slightly narrower peak and therefore better explanation for the spectrum .",
    "a value of @xmath47 greater by one more order of magnitude is the limiting value if we want to explain the entire x ",
    "ray spectrum .",
    "however , this already high value of @xmath51 is drastically modifying the tev spectrum , where the limiting slope ( @xmath52 ) of the emission becomes well visible ( blue line in fig .",
    "2 ) . finally ,",
    "monoenergetic electron distribution can not explain the x  ray nor the tev emission .",
    "note that for values of @xmath53 close to @xmath47 , the second part of the tev spectrum , above the peak , is curved and it is not a power law .",
    "we have already applied our specific ssc scenario to 1es  1101232 and mrk  501 . in this section",
    "we apply this model to two other tev sources , mrk  421 and pks  2155304 , and compare the results .",
    "the rxte and hegra observations of mrk  421 @xcite can be fitted assuming that the x  ray emission is done by the exponential synchrotron tail of the highest energy particles at @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , the index of the particle energy spectrum and @xmath47 are not constrained by the data .",
    "the same approach can explain the rxte and h.e.s.s .",
    "observations of pks  2155304 @xcite .",
    "note that it is also possible to explain these observations , as well as the observations of mrk  501 , assuming @xmath55 .",
    "we performed our computations to show that the assumption of having @xmath56 ( required to explain the emission for 1es  1101232 ) , works very well also for other sources . in fig .",
    "[ fig_lum ] we show the results of our modeling and give the values of the input parameters .",
    "note that for mrk  501 we provide also the spectral fits for the observations made on april 7@xmath48 , 1997 .",
    "moreover , in the case of mrk  421 , mrk  501 and pks  2155304 the x - ray and tev observations were made almost simultaneously , whereas for 1es  1101232 we use the x  ray spectrum from january 1997 and the tev data collected over march - june 2004 - 2005 .",
    "note that the value of the magnetic field used in our calculations is significantly smaller that the value estimated from the equipartition between the magnetic field energy density and the electron energy density .",
    "we have shown that the standard ssc model can explain the specific observations of the relatively distant tev blazar 1es  1101232 . assuming a truncated power law energy distribution , with @xmath56",
    ", we can well explain the intrinsic tev spectrum even assuming a stronger absorption than the upper limit suggested by @xcite .",
    "this assumption appears in very good agreement with the recent estimates of the ir intergalactic background ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the limit on how hard an ssc spectrum can be is @xmath10 .",
    "this limit in turn translates in a limit on the amount of absorption suffered by tev photons , and hence on the level of the ir background .    concerning the reason of having @xmath56",
    ", we can propose two answers .",
    "the first is the injection of an already truncated power law spectrum from a shock region .",
    "if , in addition , the cooling process is inefficient for the the particles at lower energies ( close to @xmath47 ) , the particle distribution will not develop a low energy tail in a  reasonable \" time , namely a dynamical time , over which we can assume that the physical conditions ( size , densities , magnetic field ) are constant ( since the source has bulk motion , after a dynamical time it will be located in a larger part of the jet , and not contribute any longer to the observed flux ) .",
    "note that in our particular simulations also particles with @xmath57 are not affected by the cooling in one crossing time ( @xmath58 ) .    in a second , more complex",
    ", scenario all particles are accelerated efficiently at the shock front almost up to some maximal energy .",
    "then they escape downstream of the shock and cool .",
    "however , the cooling process may be compensated ( at least in part ) by some stochastic turbulent acceleration @xcite .",
    "the competition between re - acceleration ( heating ) and cooling may single out an equilibrium energy where the two processes balance .",
    "this equilibrium energy may correspond to the @xmath47 assumed in our simple ssc scenario .",
    "the changes of @xmath47 and @xmath53 may have various impacts for the source variability , especially for the correlation between the x  ray and tev emission .",
    "as an example , when @xmath59 and @xmath60 the change of @xmath47 may not affect the x  ray emission while having a strong impact for the tev radiation .",
    "such a scenario could explain the orphan tev flare in 1es  1959 + 650 @xcite .",
    "on the contrary , a change of @xmath53 would produce a significant x  ray variability without any change in the tev flux below the tev peak .",
