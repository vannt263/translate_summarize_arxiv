    "spacetime was invented using classical concepts , such as positions of bodies and ticks of clocks .",
    "although classical spacetime serves remarkably well as a backdrop for precise description of microscopic quantum systems , such as atoms and even particle collisions , the concept of a spacetime event is not easily interpreted in the context of quantum mechanics .",
    "for one thing , the notion of a pointlike event does not take account of the particle / wave duality of quantum mechanics .",
    "for another , events themselves are not , even in principle , observable quantities , but are defined only by interactions of mass - energy .    a quantum model for measuring the invariant interval between spacelike events using light quanta and clocks can be constructed in a spacetime with one spacelike dimension@xcite . however , as described below , if there is a minimum fundamental wavelength , event positions defined by wave phases in two spacelike dimensions for example , reflections off a beamsplitter surface in a michelson interferometer are intrinsically uncertain , by the geometric mean of the minimum wavelength and the event separation .",
    "this paper describes how a new fundamental nonlocal quantum uncertainty of spacetime position associated with a minimum wavelength at the planck scale could be studied with experiments that make precise position measurements in two directions across macroscopic distances .",
    "it is well known that spacetime must adopt some new quantum character below the planck length , @xmath1 meters , or planck time , @xmath2 seconds .",
    "no spatially localized quantum particle states can exist in classical spacetime above the planck energy , because of gravity .",
    "a particle spatially localized within a planck volume lies within the schwarzschild radius for its energy , behind an event horizon where it can never be seen .",
    "the interpretation of spatial wavefunctions must be modified in some way at the planck scale , an effect that may appear as a minimum fundamental wavelength or maximum frequency@xcite .",
    "the planck frontier in field theory corresponds to a uv cutoff in 3 + 1d spacetime .",
    "however , a consistent theory of mass - energy and spacetime can not be achieved simply by imposing a filter on field modes at the planck scale in some frame .",
    "a planck length ruler in some frame will , in some other frame boosted along its length , appear shorter , violating the minimum - length restriction ; or well - separated particles in one frame will in some other frame be closer together and form a black hole",
    ". the reconciliation must be achieved by a new unified theory that includes new , unfamiliar transformation properties .",
    "moreover , it is recognized that a frequency cutoff entails a violation of lorentz covariance@xcite .",
    "the new effect discussed here violates lorentz invariance , but in a new way that would not have appeared in current experimental tests .",
    "remarkably precise insights about unification at the planck scale come from the theory of black hole evaporation , whereby a black hole converts to quantum particles in flat spacetime .",
    "in particular the entropy of a black hole , identified with the logarithm of the total number of degrees of freedom of radiated particles , is one quarter of the area of its event horizon in planck units .",
    "this idea has led to the conjecture@xcite that all of physics may be `` holographic '' , encoded in some way on two dimensional null surfaces or light sheets with the same information content per area as the null surface representing a black hole event horizon .",
    "however , there has been no experimental test of this conjecture . although there are candidates ( e.g. , @xcite ) for holographic theories of everything that incorporate a minimum length at the planck scale , it is not generally agreed how to apply them to macroscopic experiments operating in nearly - flat , nearly - classical spacetime .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the experimental consequences of a particular hypothesis about how spacetime emerges in a holographic world .",
    "relationships between observables at different locations obey a `` planck information flux '' limit : correlations between observables at two events are limited by the capacity of a planck wavelength null carrier wave between them .",
    "transverse positions then have an uncertainty described by a simple effective theory based on wave optics  @xcite .",
    "a new uncertainty arises because the wavefunction encoding the transverse component of position spreads by diffraction . just as in diffraction of classical waves ,",
    "the resulting transverse position uncertainty of a system has a standard deviation of probability , @xmath3 after longitudinal propagation over a length @xmath4 , if this transverse information is encoded with minimum wavelength @xmath5 .",
    "a normalization of the minimum wavelength @xmath6 is derived from the black hole entropy - area relationship @xmath7 .    in this interpretation , families of paths that connect events and relationships of bodies in classical spacetime have roughly the same status as rays in optics : they are an approximate description of a configuration of a physical system of waves .",
    "rays have a fundamental indeterminacy imposed by diffraction limits ; the actual physical system , consisting of wave energy ( or in this application , position probability ) , is not sharply confined into rays .",
    "a time - averaged classical metric likewise does not capture all of the physical wavelike qualities . just as in wave optics ,",
    "diffractive blurring and fluctuations of transverse correlations in such a system can occur on observable scales much larger than the wavelength ( in this application , the planck length ) , given a macroscopic propagation distance .",
    "the potentially observable new phenomenon associated with these ideas is a universal `` holographic noise '' : random fluctuations in the relative transverse spacetime positions of bodies widely separated in spacetime , as measured by the phase of null fields@xcite .",
    "the spectral density of this noise is given just by the planck time , with no parameters aside from numerical factors that depend on a particular experimental setup .",
    "the paraxial - wave effective theory presented here expresses these ideas quantitatively , and makes statistical predictions for the effective positions of optical elements and for the time series of signals in michelson interferometers .",
    "the predicted amplitude in equivalent strain units is smaller than the previous published estimate by a factor of @xmath0 .",
    "the remaining uncertainties in precise normalization are mainly connected with interpreting the connection of the fundamental wavelength of this effective theory with black hole entropy .    in principle",
    ", holographic noise has a precisely characterized frequency spectrum and an absolutely calibrated normalization from black hole physics , with no parameters .",
    "it also exhibits a new , distinctive spatial shear character , unlike metric perturbations that correspond to strain motions , like gravitational waves .",
    "finally , signals in two nearby interferometers with no physical connection are shown to be highly correlated .",
    "these distinctive signatures can be used to design an apparatus to provide convincing evidence for or against the effect , and to distinguish it from other physical sources of noise .",
    "estimates are given here for the spectral amplitude of correlated displacement as a function of separation of two interferometers .",
    "this new effect , although quantum - mechanical , does not correspond to quantum fluctuations of gravitons or gravitational radiation , metric fluctuations derived from noncommutative geometry , or indeed any perturbation of the metric .",
    "it is therefore distinct from previously conjectured fluctuations of a quantum - gravitational origin ( e.g. , @xcite ) , based on various hypotheses about quantum perturbations of a metric .",
    "holographic noise on macroscopic scales can be described as a new kind of coherent movement of mass - energy relative to an unperturbed classical metric a fluctuating departure from classical geodesic trajectories .",
    "the position of mass - energy , measured in the transverse direction relative to the separation between events , jitters randomly with time relative to nominal classical geodesics , in an observer - dependent way , on the planck diffraction scale . on the other hand",
    ", the equivalence principle still holds in a long time average sense , and with respect to different forms of energy .",
    "other current tests of lorentz invariance are not sensitive to this effect . for example , since the theory is built on null sheets , identical longitudinal propagation is predicted for all null particles and radiation , so no dispersion is predicted in arrival times of photons of different energies arriving from cosmological distances , consistent with current limits@xcite .",
    "the effect is suppressed for small length scales or long averaging times . on a subatomic scale of length and time @xmath8 ,",
    "the holographic spreading over an averaging time @xmath9 is of order @xmath10 , below the range of current laboratory tests .",
    "holographic uncertainty is posited to arise at a primitive level in measurement of spacetime event positions .",
    "it is a general property of measurements of event positions defined by phases of wavefunctions that have a maximum frequency .",
    "the following general argument shows how it arises for events corresponding to interactions of null fields with massive bodies , such as laser light interacting with mirrors of an interferometer .",
    "consider a wavefunction @xmath11 that represents the quantum - mechanical amplitude for an event to occur at a position @xmath12 in a particular frame .",
    "the wavefunction can represent the state of a photon , say , where @xmath13 represents the location in one spatial dimension .",
    "the position can refer to distance from a reflecting surface along the null propagation direction .",
    "the state has a standard deviation @xmath14 in the spatial domain at a given time , that is , on a spacelike hypersurface in a particular frame .",
    "the same state is described by a wavepacket in the frequency domain with width @xmath15 .",
    "a frequency cutoff @xmath16 is imposed , so the wavefunction has the character of an envelope of width @xmath14 but no fine scale oscillations smaller than @xmath17 .",
    "suppose this state is used to compare the locations of two interaction events .",
    "the two events are separated by a macroscopic distance @xmath18 .",
    "relative positions are encoded in the relative phases of the wavefunctions at two events . in a michelson interferometer ,",
    "phases of remote reflection events are compared in two different directions .",
    "the frequency spread means that there is a phase uncertainty that accumulates with time or propagation distance .",
    "the phase uncertainty is @xmath19 , corresponding to a position uncertainty @xmath20 .",
    "substitution of the wavepacket width @xmath21 implies a minimum uncertainty in the wavefunction that describes the quantum mechanical amplitude ( or probability distribution ) for phase comparison , @xmath22 note that the computation of this uncertainty does not depend on interactions of individual quanta .",
    "it is a general property of waves with a frequency bound , and is not related to quantum fluctuations .",
    "thus , the calculation can be applied to reflections in an interferometer that involve vast numbers of photons in a coherent state , interacting with a macroscopic patch of a mirror . on the other hand , the interpretation is the standard quantum - mechanical interpretation of wave mechanics@xcite ; the actual measurement of an event position has some definite and well - defined value even though the system as a whole is described by a wavefunction",
    ". repeated measurements thus show quantum - mechanical noise .",
    "planck s constant does not appear , because the conjugate variables are both positions in the spatial domain .",
    "this uncertainty was ( justifiably ) neglected in the analysis of wigner and salecker@xcite , who studied the limits of measurement of spacetime intervals in models where photons interact with physically realizable quantum - mechanical clocks .",
    "holographic uncertainty does not involve assumptions about the definition of clocks , but derives from a fundamental limit on the comparison of phases at widely separated points that do not depend on details such as the mass of clocks or other properties of the massive bodies in the interaction .",
    "it is only important if wavefunctions have a maximum frequency , and if event positions at macroscopic separation are encoded in the relative phase of wavefunctions at two events . in holographic theories , relative transverse positions may be encoded in planck - scale phases of states , and in which case they are subject to an unavoidable uncertainty of this magnitude .",
    "this simple argument suffices to estimate the magnitude of the effect .",
    "more detailed arguments presented below suggest particular properties of the uncertainty : the effective motions in holographic theories are only transverse in character and also have a macroscopic transverse coherence .",
    "the following examples show how the transverse uncertainty is connected with transverse position measurement and with black hole evaporation states .",
    "classical spacetime is defined by a metric that describes the intervals between events . however , neither the spacetime nor the events are directly observable .",
    "measurements require interactions of wavelike quantum particles .",
    "the limits of the classical picture with a minimum wavelength are illustrated by considering quantum noise in a michelson interferometer using single planck wavelength quanta .",
    "we conjecture that there is no operational way to define spacetime event locations in two spacelike dimensions better than this limit , so the same transverse position uncertainty should appear in any apparatus .",
    "consider first just the self - interference of a single quantum of wavelength @xmath23 .",
    "the wave state splits at a beamsplitter ( half reflects , half transmits ) , then propagates along two orthogonal arms of length @xmath4 and back .",
    "the previously - transmitted part of the state then reflects , and the squared modulus of the summed amplitude is measured at the antisymmetric port .",
    "the two reflections of the particle state off the beamsplitter occur at times separated by @xmath24 ( see figure [ lightcone ] ) .",
    "= 3.2 in    two kinds of uncertainty enter into the measured phase signal .",
    "the first comes from the position wavefunction of the reflecting surface of the beamsplitter , with standard deviation @xmath14 .",
    "the second comes from the uncertainty @xmath25 in the momentum of the reflected particle state .",
    "their standard deviations are related by standard heisenberg uncertainty@xcite , @xmath26 the first part of the uncertainty in the phase signal comes from the location of the beamsplitter , which affects the path length difference between the two arms .",
    "the second part of the uncertainty in the phase signal is associated with the fact that the different momenta of the waves in the two arms leads to a difference in relative phase when they are recombined and detected .",
    "when the two parts are recombined their interference produces a holographic variance in measured phase @xmath27 given by the sum in quadrature of the two effects : @xmath28 here we choose to represent the phase in units of a reference wavelength @xmath29 , because it will be used below to calculate universal phase noise at optical wavelengths .",
    "the first factor of 2 is from the fact that @xmath14 and @xmath25 both refer to vectors at 45 degrees to the wavefronts whose phase is measured .",
    "the variance in the measured phase ( eq . [ phasevariance ] ) includes two terms that depend oppositely on @xmath14 .",
    "it is minimized when the two terms on the right side are equal .",
    "this leads to an uncertainty in phase , @xmath30 or an apparent variance @xmath31 in the arm length difference @xmath32 , @xmath33 if there is a minimum wavelength @xmath5 , eq .",
    "( [ deltax ] ) describes an irreducible uncertainty in the phase comparison . in a time series of measurements",
    "this uncertainty leads to the effect we call holographic noise .",
    "we argue below , based on black hole entropy , that the carrier wavelength for fundamental uncertainty should be set to twice the planck value , @xmath34 .",
    "this system illustrates several noteworthy features :    1 .   the combined uncertainty is a result of the wavelike character of the measurement .",
    "it is not there if we time the flights of a classical pointlike particle traveling along rays in a classical background .",
    "the group velocity of a relativistic wavepacket does not change speed with a change in momentum , so a timing measurement of a particle position eigenstate along one axis relative to a perfect clock would not reveal the uncertainty . on the other hand ,",
    "if we use wave cycles to compare the arms , there is uncertainty .",
    "the transverse character of the position measurement matters .",
    "if the two split parts of the particle state are aligned along the same axis , they share the same momentum perturbation , reducing the phase uncertainty .",
    "thus , the configuration of the interferometer matters .",
    "3 .   if the two arms are not equal , it is the shorter arm that determines the uncertainty , because the accumulated phase uncertainty is less .",
    "4 .   nowhere in the calculation does the mass of the beamsplitter enter explicitly . on the other hand , to achieve the minimum noise , the wavefunction of the beamsplitter surface does matter .",
    "the beamsplitter position wavefunction and the particle momentum uncertainty both contribute to the phase uncertainty .",
    "nowhere in this calculation does it matter `` where the photon hits the beamsplitter '' , that is , the transverse location of the photon beam does not matter to first order .",
    "there is no reference to a ray or a propagation direction , only to the locations of wavefronts and optical surfaces .",
    "the noise is thus not due to a jitter in pointing , or the uncertainty in where the particle reflects off the beamsplitter ; in fact , this is not measured .",
    "it is the position of the wavefronts , and the position of the beamsplitter itself at the times of the two reflections , that affect the measured phase .    with coherent radiation including many quanta ,",
    "the standard quantum uncertainty can be reduced . with @xmath35 quanta in the same state ,",
    "the position uncertainty becomes @xmath36 , because all the quanta participate in a single measurement with the same @xmath37 .",
    "the phase term remains @xmath38 as before because the phases of the coherent quanta are the same .",
    "the result is a smaller minimum uncertainty in the apparent arm length difference , @xmath39 a laboratory interferometer uses this feature to reduce the quantum uncertainty in measurement , using enormous numbers of photons in an optical cavity.@xcite    however , planck radiation can not have an occupation number greater than unity .",
    "( if it did , then the particles would form a black hole in some frame . ) in this case the phase of each quantum is independent . for a measurement with @xmath35 independent quanta ,",
    "the first uncertainty becomes @xmath40 , because each quantum makes an independent measurement and the accumulated perturbations add in quadrature .",
    "the second becomes @xmath41 because the mean phase displacements add in quadrature .",
    "the minimum uncertainty is not reduced in this case , so the planck interferometer has an irreducible uncertainty in measured phase , corresponding to a variance in beamsplitter position wavefunction ( or arm - length difference ) given by eq .",
    "( [ deltax ] ) .",
    "we have discussed this effect as if it is a standard heisenberg position uncertainty created by planck waves in a classical background , with an extra limit imposed on phase density of quanta .",
    "it describes the best measurement possible of relative positions in two spacelike dimensions , given the limitations of interactions of mass - energy with a planck frequency cutoff .",
    "wigner and salecker@xcite showed that a spacetime consisting of one time dimension and one spacelike dimension can be consistently defined with quantum - mechanical measurements .",
    "the interval between any pair of spacelike - separated events can be measured using clocks on the worldlines of the two events , and light quanta travelling from one worldline to the other .",
    "however , the calculation we have just done suggests that there is more to the story if we add a second spacelike dimension .",
    "if the measurement is done with wavelike quanta , there is additional uncertainty , at the diffraction scale for the waves , in event positions transverse to the light whose wave phase is used for the measurement .",
    "the world - line of a beamsplitter defined this way has additional quantum noise .",
    "if an upper limit on frequencies and spatial wavenumbers is connected with the unification of spacetime and mass - energy , it could lead to a fundamental limit on the definition of positions of mass - energy within a spacetime .",
    "a measurable phase uncertainty could result from a new kind of uncertainty principle due to unification physics .",
    "this argument suggests that interferometers may offer a route to planck scale physics because the uncertainty is magnified in a macroscopic apparatus to much larger than the planck length .",
    "optical - wavelength interferometers can reach the planck quantum limit because they can measure the mean position of massive bodies to this precision over a large surface area , macroscopic on a scale of millimeters to centimeters , over large @xmath4 on a scale of up to kilometers , with very large numbers of coherent quanta .",
    "however , they are still subject to the planck bound because of new physics described by holographic unification . it is argued below that universal holographic noise adds another feature not captured by the calculation just presented based on a single quantum in a fixed spacetime : when the wavefunction is collapsed , the measured displacement is coherent on scale @xmath42 , even with no physical connection .",
    "holographic unification was originally motivated by black hole physics , especially black hole evaporation .",
    "the holographic principle@xcite adopts the view that the entropy of an event horizon exemplifies a general property of all null surfaces .",
    "evaporation offers insights into unification because the entropy of the black hole event horizon an object defined by properties of a pure vacuum solution of classical relativity is converted into the entropy of ordinary particle quantum states in a flat spacetime background",
    ". we can use this process to estimate holographic uncertainty of macroscopic position in flat spacetime . here",
    "we sketch the argument without numerical factors of the order of unity , although it should be possible to calibrate the predicted uncertainty with a more careful calculation .",
    "in hawking evaporation , degrees of freedom of a black hole are converted to free particle states .",
    "a typical final evaporated state has no black hole ; it is a nearly empty vacuum spacetime with about the same number of particles as the number of planck areas in the original event horizon .",
    "holographic uncertainty can be derived directly from the requirement that black hole evaporation obeys quantum mechanical unitarity .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom of the position eigenstates of particles evaporated from a black hole must agree with the degrees of freedom of the hole .",
    "consider a black hole of radius @xmath43 , in the center of a giant spherical shell of photographic film of radius @xmath4 .",
    "after a long time , the hole has evaporated .",
    "each evaporated particle has left an image on the film . in principle",
    "the arrival times can be recorded so different arrival times correspond to different states .",
    "there are about @xmath44 particles altogether . at the time a particle evaporates , its wavefunction is close to isotropic ( an s - wave state ) ; however , capturing the images on the film converts the system to one where the particles are eigenstates of position , or more precisely , emission time and angular direction relative to the hole .",
    "thus the macroscopic system with the recorded images violates the s - wave symmetry of the evaporated wavefunction .",
    "nevertheless the size of the final hilbert space must be the same .",
    "the number of states of the evaporated particles can not be more than the number of states of the hole .",
    "this is works out about right if the distant , flat spacetime has a new holographic uncertainty in transverse position independently of the properties of the hole .",
    "think of the hole as covered in planck size pixels . in thermal evaporation ,",
    "every time @xmath45 , the hole is reduced by the typical thermal particle mass @xmath46 and shrinks by about one planck area .",
    "the number of different ways to disassemble the hole is the number of ways this can happen @xmath35 times over .",
    "it equals the number of evaporated states if for each particle the number of final directional eigenstates is also @xmath35 .",
    "every evaporation time @xmath47 there are @xmath35 choices of direction , and this has to match the number of options for the image location for that particle in the final image .",
    "suppose that this match is accomplished with a new uncertainty @xmath48 in the transverse positions of the particle images , so that the information , or number of degrees of freedom in the film image is @xmath49 .",
    "this refers to a new relative uncertainty in transverse position over large distances @xmath42 .",
    "the film can have normally fine - grain pixelation in local measurements ; its local physics is not changed .",
    "nearby images , formed at nearly the same time , share the same `` holographic displacement '' ; nearby displacements are coherent , and there is no local blurring on scale @xmath48 . however , images formed far apart in time or space have a new indeterminacy or noise in transverse position relative to each other , by about @xmath48 .",
    "the number of evaporated particle states matches the number of black hole states if @xmath50 .",
    "this agrees with the black hole entropy as long as @xmath51 if @xmath48 were smaller than this , then the amount of information per evaporated particle would be larger than that available in the hole .",
    "it would take more data to specify the final state than is available in the initial state .",
    "now in addition , the ordinary heisenberg uncertainty tells us that for the particles of energy @xmath52 , typical for the evaporated particles , there is already a transverse uncertainty in the image location , @xmath53 , that is , the images are locally not sharper than a particle de broglie wavelength",
    ". then we get @xmath54 or @xmath55 which is just the holographic uncertainty at distance @xmath4 .",
    "it dominates over standard locally - defined heisenberg uncertainty ( that is , it is bigger than the particle wavelength ) for @xmath56 .    indeed this uncertainty does not depend on @xmath43 or any property of the hole , only on @xmath4 , so we conjecture that it is a property of matter position in flat spacetime .",
    "formally we may take @xmath43 to vanish and require that black holes of any size have unitary evaporation .",
    "again , the uncertainty is not observable locally there is no new  fuzziness \" in a small patch of the distant film .",
    "rather , the relative angular positions of widely separated images formed are fuzzy , in a coherent way relative to each other , or relative to the position of the hole .",
    "if images form within a time @xmath57 of each other and are physically near each other , they share the same holographic displacement ; thus the uncertainty is not observable in any measurement on a scale @xmath58 .",
    "if positions in flat spacetime have this transverse indeterminacy , in addition to the heisenberg uncertainty , then a black hole of any size can leave behind a state with the same size hilbert space it started with . since the uncertainty in the distant space does not depend on any property of the hole",
    ", it must apply to positions in the spacetime even if there is no hole at all .      in a certain sense ,",
    "holographic uncertainty is a general property of any frequency - bounded wave field .",
    "consider a cubic volume of space with a massless scalar field obeying the linear wave equation with reflecting walls .",
    "it is conventional to decompose solutions into discrete sinusoidal modes that fit in the box . given an upper bound on wave frequency , the number of modes is proportional to the 3d volume .",
    "when such a field is quantized , the modes are identified as harmonic oscillators and separately quantized .",
    "each one is identified as a degree of freedom .",
    "thus , the number of degrees of freedom appears to be proportional to volume .",
    "each mode has a number operator and this is one way to decompose the quantum states of the field .",
    "this view is however misleading .",
    "field configurations can also be built from a sum of radiation entering along each face of the cube , with a cutoff in transverse wavenumber corresponding to the maximum frequency .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom for propagating waves and particles is thus proportional to surface area , not volume .",
    "the reconciliation of these two conclusions is that the 3d modes are not really independent degrees of freedom .",
    "the linear decomposition makes it look that way , and certainly one can build any classical solution by adding linear plane wave mode solutions .",
    "but the 3d plane waves are not independent quantum degrees of freedom .",
    "a given field configuration can be described by many different linear combinations of plane wave modes .",
    "a more rigorous derivation showing holographic scaling of total entropy in quantum field theory is given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the macroscopic behavior of holographic unification can be interpreted using a wave model of emergent spacetime .",
    "the relationship between transverse positions at two times is described by a quantum wavefunction .    in previously described quantum operator language@xcite , the transverse positions at different times along a null path are conjugate observables , like normal position and momentum in ordinary quantum mechanics , with a commutator @xmath59= - i ct_{12}\\lambda_p$ ] . in a more localized form , @xmath60=-i\\lambda_p .",
    "$ ] the observable operator @xmath61 represents the center of mass position of mass - energy on a particular wavefront . in a holographic light sheet frame , a state describes the null volume swept out by a sheet , including transverse center of mass position along that null trajectory in some lab frame .",
    "the variable @xmath62 is interpreted as an angular deviation from the classical @xmath63 axis , the normal defined by null fields in our 3d world .",
    "these heisenberg - like uncertainty relations give the same result for the wavefunction width as a wave optics calculation .",
    "the wavefunction can be computed in the same way as transverse mutual complex correlation of field amplitudes for radiation of frequency @xmath64 in standard wave diffraction theory@xcite .",
    "the width of the mutual complex correlation , the joint wavefunction of transverse position at points separated by @xmath65 , increases like @xmath66 .",
    "the wave hypothesis developed here is based on the paraxial wave equation , another well studied tool in optics theory .",
    "this formulation allows a more direct connection with a macroscopic limit of fundamental theories , such as matrix theory .",
    "the circumference of a compactified m dimension is identified with the wavelength of a carrier wave in the emergent spacetime , and the complex phasor amplitude of deviations from the carrier is identified as a wavefunction for spacetime position relative to a classical spacetime .",
    "this approach allows us to write down specific eigenstate wavefunctions , and use spatial solutions , such as gaussian beams and wave eigenstates , to compute experimental predictions .",
    "a specific way to formulate the holographic hypothesis is to posit that effective spacetime wavefunctions describing macroscopic position states are solutions of the paraxial wave equation . in an emergent 3d space ,",
    "a 2d light sheet appears as a wavefront moving at the speed of light .",
    "the state is thus naturally described as deviations from the wavefronts of a periodic plane wave .",
    "the frequency of the carrier is the fundamental frequency in some given lab frame .",
    "start with the standard 3d wave equation for a field with a single fixed frequency . in three dimensions ,",
    "the 3d wave equation for any field component can be written as the modulation of a carrier wave , @xmath67 here @xmath68 is a complex phasor representing the amplitude and phase at each point .",
    "we use euclidean coordinates @xmath69 to denote positions in an arbitrary lab rest frame .",
    "a sinusoidal time dependence is built in , @xmath70 , where @xmath71 . in holographic geometry",
    "the carrier is at the planck frequency .    to derive the paraxial wave equation",

    "@xmath63 corresponds to position in a particular direction that defines the normal axis of a holographic frame , and @xmath74 to position in a transverse dimension .",
    "the wave equation for @xmath73 becomes @xmath75 the paraxial approximation is to assume that the third term is negligible compared with the others : @xmath76 this equation is proposed as an effective wave equation governing transverse position states of mass - energy relative to classical spacetime on macroscopic scales , in a small - angle approximation .",
    "equation ( [ paraxial ] ) is the same as the nonrelativistic schrdinger wave equation , with @xmath63 replacing time and @xmath77 replacing @xmath78 .",
    "it should be emphasized that this phenomenological description is not a fundamental theory .",
    "the carrier field is not a dynamical physical field , but a calculational tool .",
    "it is constructed to represent the holographic behavior in a lab frame ; thus , the wavefunction represents the slowly varying parts of the spatial behavior relative to a planck frequency plane wave",
    ". a true carrier field would not be invariant under boosts to another frame , and neither is this ; the wavefunctions are frame - dependent .",
    "similarly , the expansion in paraxial coordinates makes sense if the fundamental theory is built on 2d light sheets , even if the actual wavefronts are not the same in a different lab frame .",

    "since the jitter is coherent , it is only observable by measurements that compare position nonlocally , over large spacetime volumes . at the same time , aligned measurements covering nearly the same spacetime volume show nearly the same jitter .",
    "the detailed correlation of two interferometers is suggested by the matrix theory interpretation and wave solution ( eq . [ matrixsolution ] ) .",

    "the details of a particular observed time series only reveal themselves in the course of the decoherence or collapse of the wavefunction , that is , measurements .",

    "the correlation is expected insofar as the optical elements of the two interferometers are described by different sets of d0 branes on the same light sheets at the same time .",
    "they all share the same holographic wavefunction for their collective transverse position , the trace of the matrix including all the branes .",
    "the position variable represents the center of mass position without reference to other physical connections .",
    "the effect of a measurement on collapsing a wavefunction is confined to its future light cone .",
    "also , a phase measurement can only depend on events in its past light cone .",
    "thus for measurements to be correlated , two relevant light cones must overlap : the future light cone of one reflection , and the past light cone of the second reflection with which it is compared . hence to obtain correlated signals the light paths ( as in figure [ lightcone ] ) must enclose a common spacetime volume .",

    "if the in - plane displacement exceeds the arm length in either direction , the correlation disappears .",
    "this is the consequence of causality : correlations only arise if causal spacetime volumes defined by light paths in the two machines overlap . using these criteria",
    ", we can make a guess at the approximate cross correlation behavior for displacements along the arm directions .",

    "therefore , for @xmath186 , the cross correlation must be nearly perfect ; the spacetime wavefunctions for the differences of @xmath74 and @xmath91 between the two systems are very narrow compared to the total wavefunction width corresponding to @xmath191 .",

    "<S> arguments based on general principles of quantum mechanics suggest that a minimum length or time associated with planck - scale unification may entail a new kind of observable uncertainty in the transverse position of macroscopically separated bodies . </S>",
    "<S> transverse positions vary randomly about classical geodesics in space and time by about the geometric mean of the planck scale and separation , on a timescale corresponding to their separation . </S>",
    "<S> an effective theory based on a planck information flux limit , and normalized by the black hole entropy formula , is developed to predict measurable correlations , such as the statistical properties of noise in interferometer signals . </S>",
    "<S> a connection with holographic unification is illustrated by representing matrix theory position operators with a schrdinger wave equation , interpreted as a paraxial wave equation with a planck frequency carrier . </S>",
    "<S> solutions of this equation are used to derive formulas for the spectrum of beamsplitter position fluctuations and equivalent strain noise in a michelson interferometer , determined by the planck time , with no other parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral amplitude of equivalent strain derived here is a factor of @xmath0 smaller than previously published estimates . </S>",
    "<S> signals in two nearly - collocated interferometers are predicted to be highly correlated , a feature that may provide convincing evidence for or against this interpretation of holography . </S>"
