    "strongly correlated classical and quantum two - component systems are of high interest in many fields , for a recent overview see @xcite .",
    "examples include electron - hole plasmas in semiconductors , e.g. @xcite , dense electron - ion plasmas ( warm dense matter ) and complex or dusty plasmas @xcite .",
    "while the simple one - component plasma ( or jellium ) model of a coulomb system has been studied in detail it disregards many fundamental properties , in particular the formation and phases of bound states .",
    "much less is known about `` real '' two - component plasmas .",
    "although a number of studies have been performed in recent years , e.g. @xcite , many questions remain . in particular , the phase diagram and its dependence on the mass ratio of the two components is known only qualitatively .    here , we analyze these questions by considering the simplest realization of a neutral two - component plasma : a bilayer system with spatially separated light negative and heavy positive charges , in the following referred to as electrons ( `` @xmath0 '' ) and holes ( `` @xmath1 '' ) . at low temperature and large mass anisotropy , @xmath2 , the ( classical ) heavy component has a tendency to form a wigner crystal whereas the light component forms a neutralizing background .",
    "thus , a strong ( weak ) coupling situation is realized for the heavy ( light ) component , which can be quantified in terms of the one - component coupling parameter , @xmath3/[\\hbar^2/m_\\alpha \\bar{a}^2]=\\bar{a}/a_b$ ] , where @xmath4 are the effective particle masses @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the elementary charge , @xmath7 the dielectric constant , and @xmath8 denotes the reduced planck constant . for each species",
    ", @xmath9 depends on @xmath4 ( via the bohr radius @xmath10 ) and the particle number density @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the average inter - particle distance and @xmath13 the dimensionality of the system ) .",
    "when @xmath0-@xmath1 bound state ( exciton ) formation takes place , the residual ( screened ) interaction between these almost neutral complexes weakens , i.e. @xmath14 is reduced , up to the point where a crystallization into a wigner solid is prevented .",
    "generally the formation of few - particle bound states is limited to low temperatures .",
    "their correct theoretical description calls for a full quantum - mechanical treatment , in particular if temperature and density effects , as well as their stability against quantum fluctuations is addressed for low - dimensional systems .",
    "this provides the motivation of the present work : after giving a brief overview on existing results on e - h bilayers , we perform a first - principle numerical analysis of thermodynamically stable phases of a two - component coulomb plasma in the bilayer geometry with spatially separated electrons and holes , and map out major regions of the phase diagram .",
    "thereby the focus is on the inter - layer and intra - layer particle correlations , leading to bound state formation and charge ordering , respectively .",
    "the main advantage of a bilayer system is the easy control of the coupling between the layers via the layer separation @xmath15 .",
    "actual realizations range from electron - ion quantum plasmas  @xcite to electron - hole systems in semiconductors  @xcite . in the latter spatially separated electrons and holes",
    "can be realized in double quantum well heterostructures  @xcite .",
    "recent advances in fabrication technology ( lithography techniques and molecular beam epitaxy ) allow for a good control of the electron / hole density and the spatial inter - well distance .",
    "both classical and quantum electron - hole bilayers have been a subject of active research during the last decades  @xcite .",
    "_ classical bilayers _ ( corresponding to high temperature and low density ) have been investigated by molecular dynamics simulations to reveal their static and dynamical properties  @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram has been explored as a function of the layer separation @xmath16 , with the principle result that for @xmath17 the inter - layer correlations stabilize the wigner crystals in both layers ( the melting temperature is increased ) compared to a single layer wigner crystal . for _ quantum bilayers _",
    ", at zero temperature , the static and dynamic dielectric response has been analyzed in refs .",
    "the presence of a second ( oppositely charged ) layer was found to enlarge the region where a crystalline phase exists in the @xmath18 plane to higher densities , @xmath19 , or @xmath20 ( @xmath21 denotes the brueckner parameter ) .",
    "the critical value of the parameter @xmath22 , characterizing the critical particle density , changes from @xmath23 for independent layers  @xcite to @xmath24 for a bilayer .",
    "quantum melting of a coulomb crystal is caused by the zero - point motion of the particles around their lattice sites .",
    "similar to the classical case , these fluctuations are suppressed by attraction to the particles residing in the second layer , in particluar if they also form a lattice . in this way",
    ", a stack of two wigner lattices appears to be more stable then a single layer crystal .",
    "the second component plays also a prominant role when electron - hole bound states are formed , e.g.  for systems of spatially indirect excitons .",
    "then the quantum bilayer is similar to a 2d system of dipoles .",
    "the transition from coulomb ( dominant at @xmath25 ) to dipolar ( @xmath26 ) correlations shifts the critical density of the solid - gas phase transition to a lower value  @xcite , which scales with the dipole moment ( or the layer separation ) as @xmath27 . in the dipole approximation ( @xmath28 )",
    ", the bilayer phase diagram should be similar to that for bosonic dipoles in 2d and includes superfluid and normal gases  @xcite as well as a dipolar solid , if the composite particles obey bose statistics .",
    "a more accurate treatment that accounts for the internal structure of bound states and allows to release the restriction @xmath28 , was recently performed , see ref .",
    "there it was shown that the a realistic finite layer width restores the @xmath29-coulomb scaling at small distances which makes an exciton solid unstable at high densities similar to the case of a 2d wigner crystal .",
    "besides macroscopic systems , _ mesoscopic bilayers _ with full account of fermi statistics have been studied recently  @xcite .",
    "such systems are of particular relevance for experiments with carriers confined by an external trap potential , e.g. electron - hole systems in coupled quantum dots , where both the distance between the dots and the in - plane carrier density are tunable parameters . in contrast to bulk systems , in a mesoscopic bilayer",
    ", a change of @xmath15 leads to a sequence of structural transitions and shell structure formation  @xcite similar to complex plasmas @xcite .    another important aspect , which has not been studied in detail so far , concerns the influence of the mass - asymmetry @xmath30 between the bilayer charge carriers . a mass ratio @xmath31 is expected to have a significant effect on the phase diagram , as the zero - point energies of light electrons and heavy holes differ , which in turn will influence inter - particle correlations  @xcite . depending on the particle density , the light component ( electrons ) can be in a homogeneous fermi gas phase , while the heavier component ( holes ) can form a wigner lattice when the mass ratio exceeds a critical value , @xmath32 ( with @xmath33 for typical electron densities in semiconductors which is about a factor @xmath34 lower than in a @xmath35 plasma @xcite ) .",
    "the critical value @xmath36 can be tuned by the layer separation @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "this is in favor of wigner crystallization ( at least for a heavy component ) in a two - component coulomb system .",
    "in contrast , in a 2d one - component system ( electron gas ) crystalliztation ( which is expected to appear for @xmath37  @xcite ) could not yet be observed   since the typical particle densities are too high ( @xmath38 ) , and quantum fluctuations destroy any spatial ordering .    in the following , we present a more systematic analysis of _ macroscopic bilayers _ , by considering a wider range of densities / inter - layer separations and mass ratios .",
    "we identify different structural phases by analyzing the pair distribution functions and reconstruct the phase diagram .",
    "for this purpose we adopt the path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) technique for simulations of spatially separated electron - hole systems  @xcite .",
    "we note that quantum effects between electrons and holes are fully taken into account by the pimc formalism based on the stochastic sampling of the @xmath39-particle density matrix .",
    "a wide class of electron - hole bilayers can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath40 the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) mimics the coupling between the electrons and holes residing in different layers .",
    "obviously , the ground - state and thermodynamic properties of the system depend on the following experimentally accessible and managable parameters : ( i ) the hole - to - electron mass ratio @xmath41 , ( ii ) the inter - layer separation @xmath42 , ( iii ) the in - plane particle density @xmath43 , and ( iv ) the temperature @xmath44 ( measured in hartree : @xmath45 ) . in the simulations we considered a bilayer system with @xmath46 electrons and holes .",

    "a similar argument applies to the exciton crystal , which should exist for layer separations above a critical value @xmath136 , where @xmath137 for @xmath95  @xcite . in the vicinity of the excitonic mott transition more refined simulations , including an accurate analysis of the fraction of ionized and bound states and a full account of the fermi statistics @xcite of electrons and holes would be required .",
    "in this report , we analyzed the structure and stability of possible phases of a neutral electron - hole bilayer in a wide range of the system s control parameters : layer separation , particle density , and mass ratio at a fixed low temperature . to this end",
    "we performed large - scale unbiased path integral monte carlo simulations .",
    "the properties of the observed exciton gas , exciton crystal , hole crystal and electron - hole plasma phases are characterized by pair distribution functions and snapshots of the instantaneous particle densities . for a representative set of mass ratios , @xmath77 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 ,",
    "the phase diagram was mapped out .",
    "it shows the complex interplay between the intra - layer and inter - layer correlations as well as stabilization and destabilization effects of the second layer on the wigner crystal in a 2d coulomb system",
    ". currently , extensive simulations are underway that use a denser grid of simulation parameters that will allow to draw the phase boundaries with higher accuracy .",
    "our results are important for strongly correlated two - component charged particle systems in general @xcite and for complex plasmas in particular @xcite .",
    "common to all these systems are collective phenomena resulting in a rich variety of phases",
    ". of particular interest is the possibility to control the interparticle interaction in e - h bilayers by changing external parameters ( inter - layer separation , density ) .",
    "these concepts are also of interest for complex plasmas and for charged particles in contact with surfaces @xcite where similar pinning and crystal stabilization effects occur due to the presence of surface defects @xcite .",
