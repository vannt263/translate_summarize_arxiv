    "the analysis of binary star systems is a very important part of astrophysics .",
    "calculations of their orbits allow us to directly determine the masses of their components , which also gives us a chance to estimate other physical parameters .",
    "moreover , analysis of eclipsing binary systems can provide the absolute values for the numerous physical parameters of stars , which are essential for testing stellar structure and evolutionary models .",
    "in particular , the sb2 eclipsing binary systems allow us to directly determine those parameters with a requisite accuracy @xcite . from both photometric and spectroscopic data",
    ", we can measure very accurate distance - independent stellar parameters such as stellar masses , radii , luminosities and effective temperatures .",
    "in this paper we present the first determination of the physical and orbital parameters of the double - lined detached eclipsing binary system from the _ all sky automated survey _ ( asas ) identified as asas j180057 - 2333.8 ( hereafter asas1800 ) by @xcite .",
    "the star is also cataloged as tyc 6842 - 1399 - 1 and 2mass j18005707 - 2333420 , and classified as a detached binary system in the acvs catalogue .",
    "its v magnitude at maximum brightness is 10.19 @xcite and the amplitude of photometric variations in the @xmath0-band is 0.47 mag .",
    "it has a circular orbit with a period of 269 days .",
    "the system contains two evolved giants .",
    "it is located in the galactic disc ( @xmath11 ) and has not been spectroscopically analyzed before .",
    "such systems are very rarely found ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in our galaxy .",
    "although it is relatively young , the binary system is composed of well detached bright giant stars",
    ". late type eclipsing binary systems are one of the best candidates for distance determinations @xcite .",
    "the precision of our distance determination to this eclipsing binary ( total error of @xmath12 ) rivals those obtained from interferometric parallaxes of galactic masers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* their table 1 ) at comparable distances .",
    "in this paper we focus on a precise determination of physical parameters of the system , its distance and space kinematic properties and a discussion of evolutionary status . absolute dimensions of both components are used in discussion of asas1800 s evolutionary status .",
    "we begin with a presentation of the data collection and analysis followed by a description of our results . in the last section we present our conclusions .",
    "for our analysis of asas1800 we used the archival @xmath0-band and @xmath1-band photometry from the acvs @xcite .",
    "a total of 887 and 266 measurements were obtained in the @xmath0-band and the @xmath1-band , respectively , and the data coverage for the light curve for this system is complete in both filters .",
    "the primary eclipse is total .",
    "the time span of the observations for the @xmath0-band is 3189 days ( jd 2451949 to jd 2455138 ) and 1675 days for the @xmath1-band ( jd 2452282 to jd 2453957 ) .",
    "the magnitude in the k - band was taken from 2mass catalogue and is k = 5.917 mag @xcite .",
    "the observation was made at an orbital phase of @xmath13 = 0.125 , well separated from either eclipse .",
    "the high - resolution spectra were collected with the eso 3.6 telescope at la silla observatory , chile equipped with the harps spectrograph , as well as with the euler 1.2 m telescope at la silla , chile , equipped with the coralie spectrograph .",
    "the resolution of the coralie spectrograph is @xmath1450,000 .",
    "the harps spectrograph was used in the eggs mode at a resolution of @xmath1480,000 . for our analysis",
    "we used 14 spectra in total , 12 of which were taken with the harps spectrograph and 2 spectra with coralie .",
    "in order to derive absolute physical and orbital parameters for the system , we used the wilson - devinney code ( wd ) , version 2007 @xcite , equipped with the automated differential correction ( dc ) optimizing subroutine and monte carlo simulation package .",
    "the wd code allows us to simultaneously solve multiband light curves and radial velocities which is recommended as the best way to obtain a consistent model of a binary system ( wilson 2007 ) .",
    "we also used ravespan software written by @xcite for measuring radial velocities , as well as for spectrum disentangling , used in further analysis .",
    "the ravespan code uses the broadening function formalism @xcite to measure radial velocities of the components of the binary .",
    "templates were selected from the synthetic library of lte spectra of @xcite .",
    "we calculated the components radial velocities over the wavelength range 4360 to 6800  , excluding atmospheric and strong hydrogen lines .",
    "the resulting radial velocity curve is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and the measured radial velocities are presented in the tab .  [ tab : velocities ] .",
    "the components differ in systemic velocity , and we applied a correction of @xmath15= -175 m s@xmath9s to the radial velocities of the secondary component in order to obtain an accurate radial velocity solution .",
    "such a shift can be caused either by a differential gravitational redshift between the stars or due to large - scale convective motions ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "we also determined the rotational velocities of both components in order to compare them with the expected synchronous velocities .",
    "we determined rotational velocities using the ravespan code , fitting to rotationally broadened profiles .",
    "the measured broadenings are @xmath16 = 11.02@xmath3 0.16 km s@xmath9 and @xmath17= 14.84 @xmath3 0.28 km s@xmath9 . to determine @xmath18 we also had to take into account the macroturbulence and instrumental profile contribution to our earlier measurements .",
    "in order to estimate those values we used the relation presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their equation 1 ) and @xcite ( @xmath19 = 0.42@xmath20 ) .",
    "the measured velocity is linked with rotational velocity through the relation :    @xmath21    where @xmath20 is the radial - tangential macroturbulence , and @xmath22 is the instrumental profile broadening .",
    "we estimated the macroturbulence to be @xmath23 = 3.20 km s@xmath9 and @xmath24 = 2.61 km s@xmath9 .",
    "the instrumental profile was estimated to be @xmath22 = 2.25 km s@xmath9 , assuming the resolution of the harps spectrograph in eggs mode to be r = 80 000 and using a relation given in @xcite . with these assumptions , we estimated the rotational velocities to be @xmath25 = 10.31 @xmath3 1.16 and @xmath26 = 14.44 @xmath3 1.28 km s@xmath9 .    assuming that the rotation axes are perpendicular to the orbit and the rotation",

    "we calculated @xmath29 using a formula :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the radius of a component and @xmath32 is the orbital period of the system .",
    "the measured rotational velocities are consistent with the expected synchronous velocities within 0.5@xmath33 and 1.4@xmath33 for the primary and secondary components , respectively .",
    "we conclude that the components are rotating synchronously .",

    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab : converted ]      in this section we compare the physical parameters of asas1800 ( tab .  [ tab : results_final ] ) with results of stellar evolution calculations .",
    "we assume that the components of the system have common metallicity , equal to the metallicity of the primary ( @xmath34 ) , or possibly @xmath35 higher ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "as we show below , lower metallicities lead to serious disagreement between the models and observations . in this initial study",
    "we also assume that the masses of asas1800 , as determined in tab .  [",
    "tab : results_final ] , are exact . in fig .",
    "[ fig.parsec ] we plot the parsec isochrones @xcite for the two metallicities considered .",
    "the isochrone was selected to minimize the @xmath37 function including luminosities , effective temperatures and radii of the two components .",
    "model values were calculated at the mass points corresponding to the masses of the asas1800 components ( filled circle and filled square for primary / secondary in fig .",
    "[ fig.parsec ] ) .",
    "the comparison with the parsec isochrones places the system at the early phase of core helium burning .",
    "the agreement with isochrones is not satisfactory , however .",
    "it is better for higher metallicity , but still the primary component is under - luminous and the secondary component is too cool and/or under - luminous .",
    "we note , however , that the parsec isochrones are available for only one fixed set of overshooting parameters , which strongly affect the evolutionary calculations .",
    "below , we express the extent of overshooting as a fraction of the local pressure scale height , @xmath38 .",
    "both the overshooting from the hydrogen - burning core during main sequence evolution ( @xmath39 ) and overshooting from the convective envelope ( @xmath40 ) affect the extent and the luminosity of the helium burning loops @xcite",
    ". in parsec models , in the mass range considered , these are fixed at @xmath41 and @xmath42 _ across _ the border of the convective zone determined with the schwarzschild criterion . in the calculations described below , the extent of overshooting is measured _ above / below _ the border of the convective region , which is a more common approach .",
    "the resulting overshoot parameters roughly correspond to half of those adopted in parsec ( see discussion in section 2.6 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to explore the effect of the overshooting on stellar evolutionary tracks we used  a publicly available stellar evolution code ( release 6208 ;",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "details of the code setup will be described elsewhere ( smolec et al . in prep . ) , here we summarize the most important settings .",
    "we use opal opacities and adopt the @xcite solar distribution of heavy elements .",
    "convection is modelled with the mixing length formalism @xcite with the mixing length parameter resulting from calibration of the solar model ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the convective boundaries are determined with the schwarzschild criterion .",
    "we account for the overshooting above the border of hydrogen burning core , above the border of helium burning core ( @xmath44 , fixed ) , and below the border of the convective envelope .",
    "we neglect rotation , element diffusion ( except in solar calibration ) , and mass loss . for each component of asas1800",
    "we fix the mass ( tab .  [",
    "tab : results_final ] ) and compute the evolution from the pre - main sequence until the late agb phase .",
    "our small model grid consists of two metallicity values , @xmath34 and @xmath36 , eight values of @xmath39 , @xmath45 $ ] , and two values of @xmath40 , @xmath46 $ ] . along each pair of tracks ( for the two components )",
    "we determined the models that minimize @xmath37 function including effective temperatures , luminosities and radii of the two components , at the same age .",
    "we first assume that the two components experienced the same extent of mixing at the edge of hydrogen burning core during their evolution , and hence have the same value of @xmath39 , and then allow for a difference in @xmath39 . in figs .",
    "[ fig.mesa1 ] and [ fig.mesa2 ] we show our best solutions for the described two assumptions . in the four panels of these figures we show the models with ( top ) and without ( bottom ) overshooting from the convective envelope ( @xmath47 or @xmath48 ) and adopting lower ( left ) and higher ( right ) metallicity values ( @xmath49}=-0.14 $ ] or @xmath49}=-0.04 $ ] ) .",
    "we first analyze the models assuming the same values of @xmath39 for the primary and secondary , fig .",
    "[ fig.mesa1 ] . for higher",
    "metallicity ( right panels ) the helium burning loops become less luminous and the tracks shift toward lower effective temperatures .",
    "consequently , the higher metallicity ( @xmath49}=-0.04 $ ] ) , together with the smaller extent of overshooting from the hydrogen - burning core , mitigates the problems of an under - luminous primary and a too cool / under - luminous secondary , noted in the analysis of the parsec isochrones .",
    "the inclusion of the envelope overshoot in the models has two apparent effects on the tracks .",
    "it increases the vertical extent of the loops and decreases their overall luminosity .",
    "hence , in the models including envelope overshooting , a larger extent of overshooting at the hydrogen - burning core is possible .",
    "we note that the matter that overshoots the convective envelope boundary faces a stabilizing stratification gradient .",
    "whether the significant mixing is possible in such case is a subject of debate @xcite .",
    "modelling of evolved binary systems offers the best opportunity to test mixing scenarios at the bottom of the convective envelope .",
    "the best models displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig.mesa1 ] are those with overshooting from the convective envelope ( @xmath47 ) and have @xmath50 ( fig .",
    "[ fig.mesa1 ] , top ) .",
    "the solutions assuming @xmath51 are only slightly worse .",
    "when envelope overshoot is neglected , lower values of @xmath39 ( @xmath52 ) are necessary .",
    "clearly , the best models have higher metallicity .",
    "the inferred system s age , given in fig .  [ fig.mesa1 ] , is very similar for all models , log(age ) is within a narrow range from 8.007 to 8.021 .",
    "as expected , the age is slightly larger for higher metallicity models ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "also , larger the extent of overshooting from the hydrogen burning core , longer the main sequence evolution .",
    "we note that for the best models in fig .",
    "[ fig.mesa1 ] we nearly match the luminosity of the secondary , but that the primary component is still _ before _ the observed position .",
    "hence , we can get a much better agreement between the models and observations assuming different values of overshooting from the hydrogen burning core during the main sequence evolution .",
    "a lower value of @xmath39 for the secondary slows down its evolution ( extends the main sequence phase ) and allows a much better match of the system with observations at the helium burning phase  fig .",
    "[ fig.mesa2 ] .",
    "an overshooting parameter higher by @xmath53 for the secondary allows very good fits .",
    "the best are obtained for higher metallicity models ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig.mesa1 ] ) .",
    "this time the models that neglect the overshooting from the convective envelope seem slightly better .",
    "the inferred ages are very similar to those reported in fig .",
    "[ fig.mesa1 ] .",
    "our model that matches observations best ( fig .",
    "[ fig.mesa2 ] , bottom right ) , assumes @xmath51 for the primary and @xmath50 for the secondary and places the system at the early helium burning phase .",
    "the different extent of overshooting adopted for the components of the eclipsing binary system , with nearly equal masses and metallicities of the components , might appear unjustified .",
    "we note , however , that an overshooting parameter expresses our ignorance about all kinds of mixing processes that may occur at the edge of the convective core .",
    "in particular , rotation leads to additional mixing , the extent and efficiency of which depend on the rotation rate .",
    "we see no reason to assume that the initial rotation rate was the same for two stars .",
    "we conclude that asas1800 is at early phases of core helium burning .",
    "the age of the system is slightly larger than 100 million years .",
    "the models favour a metallicity that is close to solar in value .",
    "the observations indicate that the orbit of asas1800 is circular and rotation of both components is fully synchronized with the orbital period , which means that the memory of the initial values of these parameters is at present entirely forgotten . to check ,",
    "if this fact agrees with the predictions of the tidal evolution theory of binary stars , we assume that the binary evolves as an isolated system with conserved total mass and angular momentum .    the tidal circularization and synchronization time scales are ( @xcite , @xcite )    @xmath54    @xmath55    where @xmath56 , @xmath31 and @xmath1 are respectively mass , radius and moment of inertia of the tidally distorted component , @xmath57 is the mass ratio ( with @xmath56 in the denominator ) , @xmath58 is the viscous dissipation time , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are constants that depend on the internal structure of a star",
    ". both time scales depend on a high power of the ratio of star separation to stellar radius .",
    "this ratio was of the order of @xmath61 when the binary was on the main sequence ( ms ) , resulting in both time scales much longer than the ms lifetime of the components .",
    "thus , the mutual tidal interaction at that evolutionary stage can be neglected . substantially stronger interaction",
    "is expected when both components moved to the red giant region .",
    "presently , they are both past the red giant tip , burning helium in their cores .",
    "we note that the ratio of both time scales for our binary is @xmath62 for @xmath63 and @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "that means that by the time the orbit becomes circularized , the components already rotate synchronously .    to follow the eccentricity change , detailed calculations of the circularization rate for an evolving binary",
    "are needed .",
    "such calculations have been performed by several authors for different kinds of systems and upper limits for periods of fully circularized binaries were obtained .",
    "we use the data from the paper by @xcite who calculated the limiting period values for binaries composed of giants . for giant masses corresponding to asas1800",
    "the limiting period is equal to 616 d ( see their table  1 ) . because the period of asas1800 , equal to 269 d , is significantly shorter than that value",
    ", we can conclude that the zero eccentricity of its orbit is to be expected .",
    "this conclusion can additionally be verified by a direct estimate of the absolute value of @xmath65 .",
    "we use to this purpose an approximation given by @xcite    @xmath66    we assumed @xmath67 .",
    "if we additionally assume that the characteristic value of @xmath68 over the giant phase , the convection envelope mass @xmath69 , which is a good approximation for the first ascend giants , @xmath70 and @xmath71 @xcite , we obtain @xmath72 years if tides on both components are taken into account .",
    "this is 1 - 1.5 order of magnitude shorter than the lifetime of each component of asas1800 in the red giant phase so the orbit was efficiently circularized soon after the stars reached the red giant branch .",
    "because the synchronization time scale is still much shorter , as is shown above , the rotation of both components was synchronized even faster .      to derive the distance we followed prescriptions given in @xcite .",
    "we used @xmath0-band surface brightness ( sf ) - @xmath73 color calibration measured by @xcite for galactic late type giant stars .",
    "the angular diameter of a star can be estimated using the formula : @xmath74 = 10^{0.2(s - m_0)}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the surface brightness in a given band and @xmath76 is the dereddened magnitude of a star in this band . we can then directly derive the distance to the star by scaling the angular diameter : @xmath77 = 9.2984   \\cdot \\frac{r [ r_{\\odot}]}{\\phi [ { \\rm mas}]}\\ ] ]    the resulting distance to asas1800 is d = 2142.5 @xmath3 63.5 ( stat . )",

    "pc ( tab .",
    "[ tab : results_final ] ) . the main contribution to the statistical uncertainty",
    "are random errors connected with light curve modelling by the wd code ( connected with a relatively large dispersion of asas light curves ) and infrared photometry errors .",
    "thus there is a significant room for improvement on the derived distance once high accuracy photometry will be available .. the main contribution to the systematic error comes from the sf calibration itself .",
    "the total error budget is presented in tab  [ tab : error ] .      the proper motion of the star is @xmath78 mas yr@xmath9 and @xmath79 mas yr@xmath9 and was derived as weighted mean from three catalogues ppmxl catalog @xcite , ucac4 catalog @xcite and spm4.0 catalog @xcite .",
    "this proper motion in galactic coordinates is @xmath80 mas yr@xmath9 using the prescription given by @xcite .",

    "this velocity is not corrected for solar motion with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) .",
    "taking into account the peculiar solar motion @xmath83 km s@xmath9 @xcite and the circular speed of lsr in the galaxy @xmath84 km s@xmath9 from @xcite we obtain galacto - centric velocity components of asas1800 in the position of the sun @xmath85 km s@xmath9 , where the errors are dominated by proper motion uncertainties .",

    "the accuracy of the distance determination is 4 % , is slightly less accurate than distances obtained with the same method to lmc / smc binaries .",
    "this is due to much higher interstellar extinction , somewhat lower quality of the photometric light curve and infrared magnitudes transformations between photometric systems , leading to larger errors in the absolute dimensions and final distance . with better photometry and with an improved surface brightness - colour relation it should be possible to measure 1.5  2 % distances to such individual systems .",
    "in a recent series of papers @xcite we have shown that precision of 3% is already routinely attainable for carefully selected late type eclipsing binaries .",

    "this technique is also an important and , moreover , independent way of testing the future distance and parallax determinations which will be made by the gaia mission .",

    "<S> the physical and orbital parameters of the system were derived with an accuracy of about 0.5  3% . </S>",
    "<S> the system is a very rare configuration of two bright well - detached giants of spectral types k1 and k4 and luminosity class ii . </S>",
    "<S> the radii of the stars are @xmath2 = 52.12 @xmath3 1.38 and @xmath4 = 67.63 @xmath3 1.40 r@xmath5 and their masses are @xmath6 = 4.914 @xmath3 0.021 and @xmath7 = 4.875@xmath3 0.021 m@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the exquisite accuracy of 0.5% obtained for the masses of the components is one of the best mass determinations for giants . </S>",
    "<S> we derived a precise distance to the system of 2.14 @xmath3 0.06 kpc ( stat . ) </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 0.05 ( syst . ) which places the star in the sagittarius - carina arm . </S>",
    "<S> the galactic rotational velocity of the star is @xmath8 km s@xmath9 assuming @xmath10 km s@xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison with parsec isochrones places the system at the early phase of core helium burning with an age of slightly larger than 100 million years . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of overshooting on stellar evolutionary tracks was explored using the mesa star code .    </S>",
