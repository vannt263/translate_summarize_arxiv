    ", we will adopt the following symmetrization strategy : we first obtain a relatively converged ground state with an extended hole density profile , then we symmetrize the system by copying all the operators in the left part of the system to the right part , and use this as the initial state for the next step simulation .",

    "<S> alternatively , ladder systems serve as a bridge from one - dimensional ( 1d ) chains to 2d systems , offering a rich playground for studying the interplay of charge and spin degrees of freedom and providing a pathway to understand the physics of strongly correlated systems . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the motion of single hole doped into the two - leg ladder antiferromagnet is a fundamental issue to start with , where the key physics of the problem is the competition between the antiferromagnetic correlation and the kinetic energy of the hole .    </S>",
    "<S> theoretically , it has long been thought that the undoped two - leg @xmath0-@xmath1 ladder is adiabatically related to a band insulator , and earlier numerical studies supported the idea that the doped holes form conventional bloch quasiparticles.@xcite quite strikingly , recent large - scale density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) studies provide strong evidences to show that a single hole doped to the two - leg @xmath0-@xmath1 ladder localizes at large length scales , breaking the translational symmetry , which is sharply incompatible with bloch s theorem for any quasiparticle state@xcite . a more recent dmrg study of the same model however reached an opposite conclusion where the hole behaves as a conventional quasiparticle with finite quasiparticle spectral weight , and there is no charge localization@xcite . as a result , this seemingly simple problem is still in debate , requiring further independent investigation .    besides the @xmath0-@xmath1 model </S>",
    "<S> , it is also important to study the hubbard model directly to investigate the properties of a single doped hole . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to three - site correlated hopping terms discarded in traditional @xmath0-@xmath1 model studies for simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , this three - site correlated hopping term was shown to be crucial to understand the origin of the strongly dispersive feature found at high binding energy in the spectral function of the hubbard model@xcite , as well as contributing to the persistence of spin excitations with hole doping and hardening of spin excitations with electron doping in the hubbard model@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a natural question is that whether these three - site correlated hopping terms still play an important role in the ground state properties of the single hole .    </S>",
    "<S> -@xmath1 model on a two - leg square ladder . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) describe the inter - chain ( intra - chain ) hopping and spin superexchange couplings , respectively . at @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> , it reduces to the isotropic limit . ]    to answer these questions , we will focus on the two - leg hubbard and @xmath0-@xmath1 ladders in this paper in which the undoped spin background remains gapped . </S>",
    "<S> we have carried out systematic dmrg @xcite simulations to extract the ground state properties of ladders of length up to @xmath7 and elementary excitations of a single doped hole to obtain unprecedentedly complete information . following previous studies@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> we have considered a range of values of the parameter @xmath8 , the ratio of the hopping matrix elements and the spin exchange couplings on the legs and the rungs of the ladders of the hubbard and @xmath0-@xmath1 models , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : model ] . </S>",
    "<S> our principle results are : ( 1 ) in contrast to the high energy spectrum , we find that the single hole doped in the two - leg hubbard ladder behaves similarly with the @xmath0-@xmath1 model as shown in the phase diagram in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : hubbardphase ] . in the strong rung limit ( @xmath9 ) </S>",
    "<S> , the injected hole behaves as a bloch quasiparticle and there is no charge modulation in the hole density profile . </S>",
    "<S> as the ladder anisotropic parameter is continuously tuned from the strong rung limit beyond a critical value @xmath10 towards the isotropic limit ( @xmath6 ) , a strong charge modulation appears in the hole density distribution . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we conclude that the three - site correlated hopping term is not crucial in determining the ground state properties of the single doped hole . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) we found that the elementary excitation energy of the single doped hole in two - leg @xmath0-@xmath1 ladder scales as @xmath11 in both limits , including the strong - rung limit @xmath9 and isotropic case @xmath6 , supporting the quasiparticle behavior of the doped hole . as the single hole doped in both models has similar behavior , our conclusion for the @xmath0-@xmath1 ladder should also apply for the hubbard ladder , i.e. , the injected hole also behave as a quasiparticle in the isotropic limit . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) although in the long - wavelength limit , the single doped hole behaves similarly in both the strong rung limit ( @xmath9 ) and isotropic case ( @xmath6 ) , there is a significant difference between them . </S>",
    "<S> the spin and charge of the hole are tightly bound together as a quasiparticle at a length scale @xmath12 lattice spacing in the strong - rung limit , however , they are only loosely bound together at a longer length scale @xmath13 lattice spacings in the isotropic case . </S>",
    "<S> this loose quasiparticle has a nontrivial internal structure since the spin partner can now move away from the charge partner , leading to an important residual effect which significantly changes the local structure of the ground state wavefunction .    in section [ sec : model ] , we define the model hamiltonians of the two - leg @xmath0-@xmath1 and hubbard ladders . in section [ sec : hubbard ] , we present our dmrg results for the two - leg hubbard ladder , and calculate the elementary excitations of the single hole doped in the two - leg @xmath0-@xmath1 ladder in section [ sec : elementary ] . section [ sec : residualeffect ] is devoted to the residual effect and a conclusion is given in section [ sec : conclusion ] . </S>"
