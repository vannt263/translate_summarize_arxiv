    "since the discovery of the first so - called edgeworth - kuiper belt object 1992 qb1 ( jewitt and luu 1993 ) , approximately 65 trans - neptunian objects ( tnos ) have been catalogued , ranging in apparent magnitude from about 20 to 24.6 in r - band and in heliocentric distance from 30 to 50 au .",
    "the dynamical structure and properties of objects in this region hold signatures of the outer planet - formation process ( _ e.g. ,  _ malhotra 1995 , morbidelli and valsecchi 1997 , weissman and levison 1997 ) . assuming comet - like albedos of @xmath6 , the discovered objects have diameters @xmath7 ranging from @xmath8100 to 800 km .",
    "albedo uncertainties will effect this size range somewhat , with diameters scaling as @xmath9 .",
    "the size distribution of tnos is of great interest .",
    "although originally it had been hoped that the population might be collisionless and thus might retain the signature of the planetesimal formation process , recent work ( davis and farinella 1997 , stern and colwell 1997 ) has shown that collisional effects can not be neglected over the age of the solar system .",
    "however , knowledge of the size distribution is still important for understanding the link between the kuiper belt and both the short - period comets ( levison and duncan 1997 ) and pluto ( weissman and levison 1996 ) . dones ( 1997 ) provides an excellent review of the open problems in kuiper belt research .",
    "the hst results of cochran _ et  al .  _",
    "( 1995 ) provided another strong observational motivation by statistically detecting a very large population of faint trans - neptunian objects near @xmath10 ; our research was partially motivated by attempting to work at intermediate magnitudes .",
    "figure  [ fig : lfunc ] shows a compilation of previous results , giving the cumulative surface density @xmath11 of tnos near the ecliptic brighter than a given limiting @xmath5 magnitude , that is , the luminosity function of the trans - neptunian belt .",
    "linear relations on this plot correspond to power - law behaviour , of the form @xmath12 , implying that the sky density of tnos increases by a factor @xmath13 with each additional magnitude of depth .",
    "it is important to note that there is no consideration in this figure of either the ecliptic latitude of the surveys , nor their elongation relative to neptune .",
    "the sky density of objects is expected to decline with increasing latitude ( jewitt _ et  al .  _",
    "1996 ) due to the expected concentration of the belt to the invariable plane of the solar system .",
    "a peak in @xmath14 is expected in a magnitude - limited sample near 90  elongation from neptune , because tnos trapped in the 3:2 mean - motion resonance with neptune have their perihelia concentrated near this elongation , and thus are brighter and more easily detected there ( malhotra 1995 ) .",
    "this resonance contains @xmath15% of the multi - opposition objects , which due to the selection bias reflects an intrinsic population of only @xmath161020% of the tnos inside 50  au ( jewitt _ et  al .",
    "however , almost all of the catalogued objects were detected in surveys conducted within a few degrees of the ecliptic at elongations roughly @xmath17 from neptune .",
    "the goal of our program , begun in 1994 , has been to find small tnos rather than more objects with diameters larger than @xmath8100 km . instead of searching large areas of sky to limiting magnitudes of @xmath18  24 , we chose to concentrate on one or two fields for each observing run , and integrate for 46 hours to reach a limiting magnitude of @xmath19 for each field .",
    "in essence , the idea is that a power law increase in the sky density of objects at fainter magnitudes will produce objects in the field if the search is faint enough .",
    "thus , going deep enough will allow us to extend the range over which the luminosity function is determined .",
    "a previous negative result , covering 0.05 square degrees to a limiting magnitude of @xmath20 was reported in gladman and kavelaars ( 1997 ) , and is represented as the point pal96 in fig .",
    "[ fig : lfunc ] .    the initial work of jewitt and luu ( 1995 ) and irwin _ et  al .  _",
    "( 1995 ) implied shallow slopes for the luminosity function at magnitudes of @xmath212325 , with @xmath22 ( dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : lfunc ] , maximum likelihood fit ) .",
    "this relatively shallow slope required an upper - size cutoff for tnos to be consistent with the lack of observed objects at brighter magnitudes where various surveys had failed to find them ( this information was incorporated into the irwin _",
    "et  al .",
    "_ maximum likelihood fit ) .",
    "extrapolation of this shallow slope implied relatively few very faint tnos ( @xmath2328 ) , and yet a large population of such tnos appears to be required to supply the short - period comets from a kuiper belt source ( duncan and levison 1997 ) .",
    "the irwin _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "( 1995 ) fit was in sharp disagreement with the hst result , which statistically detected objects near @xmath24 , implying @xmath830,000 tnos/@xmath25 .",
    "there is a continuing controversy , in the literature about the hst result ( see brown _ et  al .  _",
    "1997 ; cochran _ et  al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , which will likely only be satisfactorily resolved by repeating the hst experiment . additional work by jewitt and luu ( 1996 ) doubled the number of known objects , resulting in a steeper estimate for the luminosity function slope @xmath26=0.38 ( dashed line in fig .  1 , fitted to the hollow squares and i95 point ) .",
    "more recently , jewitt _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "( 1998 , jlt98 hereafter ) completed a large area survey to relatively shallow depth ( @xmath27 22.5 ) , and reported a luminosity fuction fitted by a single power law passing through @xmath28@xmath2923.3 )  =  1 object/@xmath30with @xmath26=0.58 ; _ i.e. _ , increasing by a factor of @xmath163.8 for each fainter magnitude ( long - dash line in fig .",
    "[ fig : lfunc ] ) .",
    "the number of detected objects at @xmath31 was far below that predicted by the jewitt and luu ( 1996 ) estimate of the luminosity function , implying the even steeper luminosity function .",
    "note that in a flux - limited survey , this steeper rate of increase implies that one would expect three - quarters of all detected objects to be in the last magnitude above the limit , _ if _ the detection limit were a strict cut - off ( in the form of a heaviside function ) .",
    "in reality , since the discovery efficiency in a flux - limited sample typically falls from almost 100% to 0 over this faintest magnitude above the limit , only about half of all the objects in the final magnitude are discovered , and thus about 5565% of all discovered objects would be expected in the last magnitude above the limit ( mildly depending on @xmath26 ) .",
    "the recent survey of jlt98 ( black squares in fig .  1 ) , corrected for incompleteness for the faintest magnitudes , shows exactly this behaviour ; the previous surveys ( summarized in jewitt _",
    "et  al .",
    "_ 1996 , hollow squares in fig .",

    "obviously given the steep increase of the surface density , most objects found by such a pencil - beam search will be too faint to be followed after the discovery observations in order to obtain an accurate orbit .",
    "thus , the acquisition of a larger multi - opposition orbital database of tnos is _ not _ the primary goal of our work .",
    "under the assumptions of a _ constant _ albedo for all objects _ and _ that all objects were at the same heliocentric distance @xmath39 , then one could easily convert the apparent luminosity distribution into a size distribution .",
    "of course , in reality the strong @xmath40 dependence of reflected light means one must include a model of the orbital distribution and correct for the effects of the magnitude limited sample .",
    "jewitt and luu ( 1996 ) modeled this , based on surveys with limiting magnitudes ranging from @xmath41=23.2 to 24.8 , and obtained a size distribution in the form of a _ differential _ power law @xmath42 with index @xmath43 .",
    "the narrow magnitude range gave only a small baseline on which to establish such a power law .",
    "the recent work ( jlt98 ) to moderate limiting depth ( @xmath44 ) but covering a large area of sky ( 52@xmath25 ) , extended the magnitude baseline and concluded that a steeper @xmath45 size distribution was a better fit to the data .",
    "one should take care to draw the distinction between the luminosity function and the size distribution .",
    "the former is determined directly from observation and is relatively free from assumptions ( with awareness that @xmath14 will have some dependence on ecliptic latitude and elongation relative to neptune ) .",
    "in contrast , the size distribution is dependent on many model parameters regarding assumptions about the orbital distribution of objects , their albedos , and the functional form of the size distribution itself .",
    "because of these uncertainties , we will not attempt to remodel the size distribution to incorporate the new detections discussed below , but rather concentrate on the luminosity function .",
    "this project was carried out using observations at the palomar 5-meter and cfht 3.5-meter telescopes . since this program was driven by the requirements of observing very faint objects , we describe the instrumentation and data reduction methods before discussing the results obtained during the various observing runs of the program ( table 1 ) .",
    "the 2048@xmath322048 thinned tektronix ccd cosmic was used at prime focus of the 5-m hale telescope .",
    "the palomar chip has high quantum efficiency ( 85  90% from 550  750 nm ) , 0.28 arcsec pixels , and a square field of view @xmath46 on a side . a gunn _",
    "filter was used for the majority of the palomar observations to minimize sky brightness ; transformation to kron - cousins @xmath5 magnitudes is straightforward . following the results reported in gladman and kavelaars ( 1997 ) , two additional palomar observing runs occurred in the fall of 1997 ( 7 nights total , 5 usable ) .",
    "the university of hawaii 8k@xmath328k prime - focus ccd array on the canada - france - hawaii 3.6-m reflector was used with a conventional kc @xmath5 filter .",
    "the quantum efficiencies of this array s 8 2048@xmath324096 chips vary , but are considerably poorer ( 3040% ) than the palomar chip , resulting in a search which was much less deep , but covered a larger field ( @xmath47 ) . all cfht results reported here are from a 3-night observing run in early april 1997 .    since tnos at opposition have retrograde motions slower than 5/hour , integration times of 480 sec limited trailing losses while still giving acceptable duty cycles .",
    "for 1  seeing , 480 sec exposures produced a snr of about 6 for objects with @xmath48 at palomar , and with @xmath49 at cfht .",
    "exposures at both telescopes were acquired while using an offset guide star . on each photometric night",
    "we observed photometric standard fields ; ngc 7006 ( odewhan _ et  al .",
    "_ 1992 ) from palomar and various standard landolt fields ( landolt 1992 ) from cfht .",
    "all images involved in the deep searches were preprocessed to remove detector characteristics , including having bad columns fixed by averaging pixel values on either side .",
    "cosmic rays were not removed , for fear of removing our faint moving sources , and because the subsequent data reduction eliminates them almost entirely .",
    "the data analysis software consists of an iraf program which , given an angular rate and direction , recombines the images by shifting their pixels and then combining them .",
    "the offset for each frame is calculated based on an assumed drift rate and the the time delay between the start of that exposure and and the first frame in the sequence .",
    "thus , all stationary objects will elongate , trailing in the direction of recombination ; only objects moving near the specified angular rate will have their signal constructively add into a single seeing disk .",
    "each angular rate @xmath50 corresponds to first order to a different heliocentric distance . by recombining the frames at a variety of rates ,",
    "we can search for objects from 10100 au . since there appear to be many fewer centaurs per square degree than tnos ( jewitt and luu 1996 ) ,",
    "the most likely discovery is of new tnos in the range 3050 au .",
    "our 480 sec integration time @xmath51 resulted in trailing losses only inside 18 au , using the empirical trailing - onset criterion ( jewitt and luu 1996 ) of @xmath50t/(fhwm ) @xmath52 1 , in seeing with a fwhm of 0.9 .",
    "one would like to remove all fixed sources from these frames before beginning the processing .",
    "experimentation with subtracting from each frame a median image created from all the un - shifted frames met with mixed success due to the problem of variable seeing ( over 46 hours of integration ) , causing different point - spread functions for stellar images .",
    "since the deep - search fields were selected to have few background stars ( a few percent of the field area ) , this refinement produced negligible improvement , and thus was not used .",
    "instead we settled on an algorithm which created two analysis images for each angular rate and direction considered .",
    "@xmath53 each frame had its mean sky value subtracted and its flux equalized by scaling a bright ( but non - saturated ) star .",
    "@xmath53 the images were then shifted at the assumed rate and direction , creating a ` stack ' of shifted images corresonding to those two parameters .",
    "@xmath53 a first analysis image was then created by simply summing the shifted set ; this has the advantage of preserving all the signal but suffers because all cosmic rays appear in the ` summed image ' .",
    "@xmath53 the second analysis image ( the ` medianed image ' ) was created by rejecting the highest value for each pixel in the shifted ` stack ' , and then taking the median of the remaining pixels ( _ e.g. ,  _ fig .",
    "[ fig : rr20median ] ) ; this eliminates effectively all cosmic rays , and most of the images of the faint stars ( since non - bloomed stars contribute their psf to only a small fraction of the images as they ` pass by ' in the shifting sequence ) .",
    "it was these ` medianed images ' that were then searched for objects , although all candidates were examined in the ` summed images ' to verify their reality . to search for moving objects ,",
    "the analysis images were examined for point - like objects .",
    "what resolution is necessary in parameter space in order to detect all objects ?",
    "if the recombination rate ( in pixels per hour ) is too fast or too slow , the object s signal will trail into many pixels and faint objects will not emerge above the noise . by experimenting with artificial objects implanted in the data",
    ", it was determined that a grid spacing of half the seeing per hour was sufficient to find all objects . to err on the safe side , a grid spacing of one - third the seeing per hour",
    "was used , which resulted in all objects being visible on at least two of the medianed images ( or more for brighter objects ) .",
    "the orbital inclination of the objects will also produce motion in differing directions . however , our fields were within @xmath54 of opposition , implying that the motion of all objects will be heavily dominated by their retrograde component ( and means that main - belt asteroids are far from their stationary points and can not mimic the motion of outer solar system objects ) .",
    "even orbital inclinations of @xmath55 produce deviations of only @xmath56 in the apparent direction of tno motion across the sky ( the dominant retrograde component being at roughly @xmath57 to the equator for our spring and fall observations ) .",
    "the experimentally - determined grid separation required from our tests with implanted artificial objects was also @xmath165 .",
    "thus even though recombinations at solely the pure retrograde direction should suffice , to be cautious we searched all palomar frames at apparent rates corresponding to motions of 18 , 23 , and @xmath58 with respect to the equator .",
    "this should extend our sensitivities to all orbits with orbital inclinations @xmath2945 .",
    "since in all cases we found artificially implanted objects ( see sec .",
    "4 ) that were moving at 18  or 28 we only searched the cfht results at angles of 23 .",
    "we found that the most effective way to search the combined frames was to work at constant recombination _ direction _ , and blink 4 adjacent _ rates _ in sequence .",
    "real objects show a distinct pattern of their signal becoming stronger and then weaker as the correct rate is approached and passed . a best estimate of the rate and direction",
    "can then be established by producing a much finer resolution grid in rate and direction around the candidate object and determining which parameters maximize the signal . in practice we found that the rate and direction could be determined to similar precision by re - combining the first and second halves of the data at the candidate rate and direction , and then measuring the apparent motion on these two images ; real objects of course have similar brightness on these two subsets , although the snr is @xmath59 smaller .",
    "the constant brightness ( to the errors inherent in the photometry ) in images created with half the data set is important , since if background noise were responsible for the appearance of a low - snr object , it would have to be of constant amplitude along the direction of the trail in order to yield the same ( spurious ) amplitude and brightness profile in both halves of the integration time .",
    "all candidates had to show a profile consistent with the oversampled psf of the observing conditions , and exhibit the expected pattern of changing signal as the retrograde rate was tuned .",
    "we also examined the immediate neighbourhood of a candidate in _ all _ the images of the set to make sure no spurious event appeared ( such as cosmic ray strikes ) which might somehow produce a signal , even though the median process should eliminate such an eventuality .",
    "as a further check , each field was imaged on two adjacent nights ; a faint object at low signal to noise can thus be verified by observing it on another night at the location where its measured motion should put it .",
    "we found that we could reliably work to a snr of about 4 with almost 100% detection efficiency .",
    "the progress reported in this paper ( subsequent to the previous null result reported in gladman and kavelaars 1997 ) comes from new data obtained during two observing runs at the palomar 5-meter and one observing run at the chft 3.6-m reflector . since the instruments used differed , resulting in very different limiting magnitudes and areal coverage",

    "the october 1997 deep search was seriously hampered by clouds and poor seeing , resulting in only one deep field ( 0.025@xmath30 ) being imaged in 1.4  median seeing , to a limiting magnitude of @xmath69 . in this case",
    "we chose not to use a field with a known object present , instead selecting a section of sky with a low background density of objects from the palomar sky survey and apm catalogue , at @xmath70 , @xmath71 -64730(j2000 ) .",
    "no objects were discovered in this field , which is not surprising given the surface density estimates of @xmath810/@xmath30  from previous work near this magnitude level ( jewitt _ et  al .  _ 1996 ) and our previous upper limit ( pal96 in fig .  1 ) .",
    "the cfht data obtained with the uh8k mosaic camera resulted in single - frame limiting magnitudes about one magnitude shallower than the palomar data .",
    "the quantum efficiencies of two chips of the mosaic were so poor that we did not analyze those images , meaning that we had a reduced field of view of about 22@xmath3230 , which was later further reduced by trimming off the portions of the field not seen in all exposures caused by dithering . in our april 1997 3-night observing run we imaged two fields , one on two nights and the other on only a single night .",
    "the first field was chosen so that one chip of the mosaic would be centered upon an elliptical galaxy in virgo , allowing a simultaneous study of its globular cluster system ( although half of that chip is useless for the tno search due to crowding in the galaxy s halo ) .",
    "no new objects were found in the remaining 5.5 chips available to be searched on the two nights of april 1 and 2 1997 ut .",
    "the second field , imaged on only the night of april 3 ut , was chosen to have the object 1994 gv9 ( @xmath5=23.1 ) in it .",

    "a second tno was discovered roughly 3.5  northwest of gv9 , which we followed for 7 hours , and was easily visible in the recombined frames .",
    "there was thus no doubt as to its reality .",
    "the new tno was @xmath80.6 magnitudes fainter than gv9 , and thus we estimate @xmath72 for the new object , although the night was not photometric .",
    "this tno would not have been given a designation except for the happy coincidence that e.  fletcher _",
    "et  al .  _ had obtained 9 images of 1994 gv9 on april 7/8 1997 ut at la palma , and analysis of those frames allowed a recovery of the new object ( see mpec 1998-g10 ) .",
    "based on the five - night arc , the orbital elements in table  [ tbl : orbits ] were derived for 1997 ga45 .",
    "few recovery attempts were made during this observing run .",
    "a previously un - numbered tno was recovered , and subsequently designated 1997 cq29 ( see mpec 1997-j02 for details ) .",
    "the mosaic s large field of view permitted the tracking of some main - belt asteroids over two nights , which resulted in a recovery of asteroid 2739 taguacipa , fortuitously moving through the field , and the discovery and designation of a new @xmath73 asteroid 1997 gf38 ( mpc 29736 ) .",
    "after the images were aligned and the shifted images were trimmed of the small portions which move off the frame for the given shift rate , the palomar frames covered an area of @xmath160.025 @xmath30 . therefore , 0.05 @xmath30  of sky were searched in total in the deep fields of september . since the single 8-minute frames had limiting magnitudes of @xmath48 , a simple scaling indicates that the typically 3.5 hours of integration would be expected to yield a limiting magnitude of about 25.7 when recombined .",
    "obviously our data reduction process might not be perfectly optimal .",
    "we established the limiting magnitude of the september data by writing a software algorithm that implanted a random number of artificial objects in the data , at random places moving at random rates in random directions ( although consistent with low eccentricity objects between 30 and 50 au ) .",
    "these frames were then searched by eye in exactly the same fashion ( or coincidentally with , in most cases ) as for real objects .",

    "the 50% efficiency level is at @xmath76 , which we adopt as our limiting magnitude .",
    "this indicates that the shifting and recombination process has resulted in a loss of only @xmath80.1 magnitudes .",
    "the detection efficiency function was determined for the october palomar data in the same fashion , giving a limit of @xmath77 ( since the best october night was not photometric ) , over 0.025 @xmath30 .",
    "an identical procedure was followed for the cfht data , yielding a 50% limit at @xmath78 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : complete ] ) ; although the two fields had different numbers of exposures , the seeing was sufficiently worse on april 3rd that the combined image limits for each night are the same to within 0.05 mags .",
    "the cfht survey yielded 0.30@xmath30  of searched area after trimming .",
    "since all of our surveys have had their detection efficiency functions evaluated ( fig .",
    "[ fig : complete ] ) , we have combined all available data from all our surveys to create a cumulative surface density estimate ( table [ tbl : cumul ] ) . for convenience ,",

    "[ fig : lnew ] plots estimates of @xmath3 , along with our maximum likelihood fit ( to be discussed below ) .",
    "it is important to note that since this is a _ cumulative _ plot of all objects brighter than a certain magnitude , the deepest edge of a bin boundary should be used ; we have thus plotted our data ( table  [ tbl : cumul ] ) and the jlt98 data in this fashion .",
    "all other estimates have been plotted at the stated @xmath5 magnitude corresponding to 50% completeness of the survey . in any case , it is not these sky density estimates that are used in the maximum likelihood fits .",
    "our sky density estimates ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lnew ] ) are all about a factor of 3 above the extrapolated jlt98 luminosity function .",
    "there are several possible explanations for this ( listed below ) .",
    "we were lucky at the 1-@xmath92 level and the average surface density is lower than our determination by a factor of 3 .",
    "note that we must remain systematically lucky at all of our magnitude levels .",
    "our real limiting magnitude is almost a magnitude fainter than our estimates .",
    "we doubt this because we believe that the experiments with artificial objects clearly indicate we can not find objects fainter than @xmath34 in the september data set .",
    "a complex explanation could be that the surface density is not particularly uniform on the sky , and that the surveys all correctly report a _",
    "local _ sky density .",
    "each survey samples a different depth and location relative to opposition , so this explanation is not completely unreasonable .",
    "our early september opposition survey was somewhat closer to neptune than the 90  longitude separation which is usually searched in order to avoid the galactic plane .",
    "however , the surface density of objects might be expected to _ drop _ as one moves away from 90  separation from neptune , where plutinos are coming to perihelion and thus increase the local surface density ( malhotra 1995 ) .",
    "our greater surface density works in the opposite direction from this expectation .",
    "the jlt98 sky density estimates , especially those for surveys fainter than @xmath93 , are in error .",
    "we in fact believe this possibility to be the most likely , which we now discuss .",
    "a definitive answer will require repeating the experiment , and the arrival of high - quality , large - format ccd mosaics will allow a pencil - beam survey to produce tens of detections rather than 5 , giving sufficient detections in a single field to establish a high - quality luminosity function .",
    "jlt98 report a luminosity function that rises by a factor of @xmath94 with each additional magnitude . as discussed above , with this estimate of the luminosity function the number of objects in the final magnitude , over which the detection efficiency falls from 100% to zero ( _ c.f .",
    "_ fig .  4 )",
    ", should be roughly equal to the number found at all brighter magnitudes .",
    "this is not true of the objects reported in the surveys of jewitt _ et  al .  _",
    "( 1996 ) , and in particular for the @xmath95 survey , which detected _ none _ of its 7 objects fainter than the reported @xmath96 100% completeness point .",
    "thus , this survey is internally inconsistent with the derived luminosity function at more than the 2-sigma level .",
    "it could thus be the case that the first surveys reported in jewitt _",
    "et  al .  _ 1996",
    "( from @xmath5=23 - 24.8 ) systematically underestimate @xmath14 and should thus be viewed as lower limits or , alternately , have stated limiting magnitudes that are too faint , as previously suggested by weissman and levison 1997 .",
    "we show below that the recent jlt98 survey , which does have 60% of its objects at the faintest magnitudes , when analyzed by a maximum likelihood method yields a luminosity function slope that agrees with our results .",
    "the hst result also suffers from the inverse internal consistency problem , in that of order 40% of its objects should be brighter than its 100% completeness limit , in contrast to the zero found .",
    "our estimate of the sky density estimates for the hst survey ( discussed below ) incorporate this effect .",
    "we have analyzed the data from surveys available in the literature by adopting a simple model @xmath97 , and using bayes s theorem to infer the model parameters .",
    "the bayesian approach is particularly suitable here because it allows us to readily combine information from disparate surveys simply by multiplying the likelihood functions for each survey .",
    "the likelihood functions can be derived using the poisson distribution .",
    "most surveys report a detection efficiency ( or detection limit ) and the magnitudes of a finite number ( possibly zero ) of detected objects . for such surveys , the likelihood function for the parameters @xmath98 takes a form similar to that derived by irwin _",

    "for the upper limits we have taken the efficiency to fall from unity to zero across a range of 1 magnitude centered on the quoted 50% detection limit of the survey . for the object likelihood functions we use gaussian functions with means equal to the best - fit values of @xmath5 and standard deviations equal to the stated errors , or the root mean squares of the statistical and systematic errors when these are provided separately .",
    "this likelihood function improves on that of irwin _ et  al .  _",

    "( 1995 ) implicitly took @xmath102 to be heaviside functions ) .",
    "of these improvements , the latter is the most important .",
    "a full derivation of this type of likelihood function appears in loredo and wasserman ( 1995 ) .",
    "the hst survey ( cochran et al .  1995 ) did not report the magnitudes of individual detected objects ; instead , the data consist of counts of detected objects in each of 20 magnitude bins , spanning a v magnitude range from 27.8 to 28.8 .",
    "we assume a @xmath110 color of 0.5 ; a @xmath111 magnitude error bar on the detection limit is given to account for this unknown color conversion .",

    "we built a likelihood function for these data by modelling the prograde and retrograde counts with poisson counting distributions , the former with a mean equal to the sum of the model prediction and a background rate , and the latter with a mean equal to the background rate .",
    "the background rates for each bin are unknown , but the retrograde data provide us with estimates of them ( with significant uncertainty ) . the likelihood function for each bin in such an",

    "this was necessary because the reported counts are so low in each bin that , taken independently , they provide little constraint on the signal rate ( i.e. , the background and signal - plus - background rates are so poorly determined in the narrow bins that nearly every bin is consistent with zero signal when viewed independently of other bins ) .",
    "but the background rate is presumably similar in adjacent bins , and pooling adjacent data is a simple way to account for this .    for the differential magnitude distribution",
    ", we adopted the standard exponential model , @xmath112 that is , the cumulative distribution @xmath113 obeys @xmath114 , so that @xmath115 is the magnitude where @xmath116 tno per square degree , and @xmath26 is the slope of the distribution when plotted with log - linear axes .",
    "multiplying the likelihood functions of the various surveys produces a joint likelihood function for @xmath26 and @xmath115 .",
    "we adopted uniform priors , so the posterior distribution for @xmath26 and @xmath115 is just the joint likelihood function , normalized , and the most probable parameter values are simply the maximum likelihood values . for our calculations",

    "these values were chosen because of their familiarity from the gaussian distribution , but the posteriors are not at all gaussian and the likelihood values bounding the regions have to be found numerically ; irwin _ et  al .  _ ( 1995 ) presumed gaussian statistics in finding their parameter regions .",
    "the jlt98 survey calculated a best - luminosity function via a least - squares fit to the cumulatively - binned surface density estimates .",
    "as mentioned above , because this is a cumulative distribution this should be considering the estimates to be at the faint end of the magnitude bins .",
    "more severely , using least - squares is incorrect for these data since ( 1 ) the errors are poisson , not gaussian , and ( 2 ) the errors in the points are highly correlated due to the cumulative distribution ( _ i.e. _ , the error for each fainter point contains the errors of all brighter ones ) .",
    "we have thus re - analysed the jlt98 results using a maximum likelihood method based on their detailed , published efficiency function for the survey .",
    "we do not use the older jewitt _ et  al .",

    "a cost of using a formalism that allows combination of information from disparate surveys is that there is no simple graphical illustration of the fitting process that precisely displays the role of each survey in the fit . in fig .",

    "for the purpose of plotting an estimate of the surface density of objects on our figures , we fixed @xmath26 at our best - fit value ( @xmath119 ) and rewrote the @xmath103 model , replacing the @xmath115 parameter with @xmath120 , the cumulative tno surface density for a limiting magnitude of @xmath121 .",

    "thus , after this has been completed a deep search that concentrated on a single field has 18 times the flux and thus goes 1.6 magnitudes deeper than any one of the single images from the classical method .",
    "thus , the ratio , @xmath162 , of the number of objects discovered by the deep survey to the classical survey is @xmath163 where the factor of 6 appears due to the greater areal coverage of the classical method .",
    "the methods thus discover equal numbers of objects for @xmath164 , and the deep search method discovers more objects for all steeper slopes .",
    "the point here is that the pencil - beam method uses _ all _ the available photons to contribute to the depth of the survey , whereas the classical method uses only one - third , since it is the exposure limit of a single image that determines the depth of the classical survey . for @xmath165",
    "our pencil - beam method discovers more than twice as many objects per night .",
    "of course , most of these objects are near the magnitude limit of the survey and are thus not easily recoverable in order to monitor and improve their orbits .",
    "the deep method is thus better suited to study the large - scale structure of the belt ; for example , by compiling better statistics on the number of objects as a function of ecliptic latitude .",
    "our best estimate for the luminosity function implies a surface density at magnitude @xmath166 ( radius @xmath810 km at 45 au ) of @xmath167 tnos per square degree which , assuming a belt of latitudinal extent @xmath168 implies @xmath169 kuiper belt objects from 30 to 50 au , in rough agreement with previous estimates based on the number of short - period comets ( levison and duncan 1997 ) .",
    "however , the uncertainty of the radii of a typical short - period comets and the steepness of the luminosity function results in it being very easy to tune this number by small variations of the magnitude of a ` comet ' in the kuiper belt .",
    "nevertheless , this steeper luminosity function implies that the kuiper belt could be the current source of the jupiter - family comets , although a component of objects coming from the ` scattered disk ' can not be ruled out ( see duncan and levison 1997 ) .",
    "the lack of detections of centaurs or objects beyond 50 au in our palomar data is consistent with a simple extrapolation of the size and radial distributions .",
    "a doubling or tripling of the number of tnos needs to occur without discoveries outside 50 au before there is a convincing problem with the lack of detections here .",
    "a single large ( 30@xmath3230 ) pencil - beam survey in the ecliptic to @xmath170 should answer the question .",
