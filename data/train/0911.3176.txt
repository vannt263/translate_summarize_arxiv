    "a complete inventory of all the coeval stars in a young stellar association , cluster , or group ( hereafter  association \" ) enables studies of the initial mass function ( imf ) , disk fraction , and stellar rotational properties , among other pursuits .",
    "information from associations with a range of ages enables understanding of the overall formation and evolution of young stars , including the change with time of disk fraction and stellar rotation rate .",
    "however , identifying all of the member stars of a given young association can be quite difficult .",
    "( by `` member , '' we mean objects that are clearly young , close to the same age , and often still associated with their natal cloud . ) finding all such members requires that one employ multiple observational techniques .",
    "these methods include but are not limited to x - ray surveys ( e.g. , alcal et  al .",
    "1996 , wolk et  al .",
    "2006 ) , h@xmath1 surveys ( e.g. , ogura et  al .",
    "2002 ) , variability surveys ( e.g. , carpenter et  al .",
    "2001 , rebull 2001 ) , ultraviolet ( uv ) surveys ( e.g. , rebull et  al .",
    "2000 ) , and infrared ( ir ) surveys ( e.g. , jrgensen et  al .  2006 , rebull et  al .",
    "2007 ) . at each wavelength",
    ", we can use the fact that stellar youth implies more flux at a given radiometric band ( x - rays , h@xmath1 , uv , ir ) , or more flux variability , than older stars of comparable mass , allowing separation of association members from field contaminants .",
    "when we combine the information from surveys in multiple wavelengths , we must remember that the influence of extinction due to circumstellar matter and/or the molecular cloud is vastly different at different wavelengths ; extinction affects uv and optical wavelengths much more strongly than ir . for young associations , many , but not all , legitimate members are identifiable using just one or a few survey methods .",
    "there are advantages and disadvantages to studying nearby young associations .",
    "identification of young members in an association is made easier if the objects are located at smaller heliocentric distances and therefore brighter on the whole .",
    "this is especially the case for low - mass members with very low luminosities ; a complete census of these stars and brown dwarfs can be made only for very nearby star - forming regions .",
    "on the other hand , nearby star - forming molecular clouds cover large areas of sky and therefore require large investments of observing time . at just 137 pc",
    "( with a depth of @xmath0 20 pc ; torres et  al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ) , the taurus star - forming region is one of the closest large cloud complexes with hundreds of low - mass stars , ongoing star formation , and objects ranging in age up to @xmath05 myr .",
    "studies of taurus objects have significantly influenced our basic understanding of the star - formation process for decades ( e.g. , herbig & rao 1972 , kenyon et  al .",
    ". however , the taurus molecular cloud is close enough that it subtends more than 100 square degrees of sky ; surveying all or even most of it is difficult within typical telescope time allocations .",
    "infrared surveys led to the discovery that some stars have infrared excesses , interpreted as circumstellar matter ( e.g. , aumann et  al.1984 , beichman et  al .",
    "most if not all low - mass stars form with circumstellar accretion disks , resulting in ir excesses for as long as the dusty circumstellar material survives ( e.g. , hernandez et  al.2007 ) . by using ir to survey a star - forming region ,",
    "the stars with ir excesses are relatively easily distinguished from stars without such excesses .",
    "the spitzer space telescope ( werner et  al .  2004 ) provides an excellent platform for surveying star - forming regions in the mid - ir and far - ir , enabling stars with ir excesses to be identified ; the member stars which do not have ir excesses must be recovered using different techniques such as the ones listed above . because spitzer relatively efficiently maps large regions of sky , it is a particularly useful tool for surveying large star forming regions .",
    "we have conducted a large multi - wavelength imaging and spectroscopic survey of the taurus molecular cloud ( tmc ) in order to test if our inventory of taurus members with infrared excesses is , in fact , complete .",
    "the spitzer imaging component is referred to as the taurus spitzer survey , and is described by padgett et  al .",
    "( 2008 ; hereafter p08 ) and padgett et  al .",
    "( 2009 ; hereafter p09 ) .",
    "it covers @xmath044 square degrees from 3.6 to 160 @xmath2 m  and is a spitzer legacy project , so enhanced data products have been delivered back to the spitzer science center ( ssc ) , including the catalogs on which this present paper is based .",
    "in addition to the spitzer component , there are four other major components to our taurus survey .",
    "xmm - newton was used by the xmm - newton extended survey of the taurus molecular cloud ( xest ) program ( e.g. , gdel et  al .  2007 and references therein ) , which mapped @xmath05 square degrees ,",
    "most of which was also mapped by the spitzer observations ; the xest data include x - ray imaging but also include ultraviolet data from the xmm - newton optical monitor ( audard et  al .",
    "xest was deliberately pointed towards aggregates of previously identified taurus members . in the optical , the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) survey",
    "( monin et  al .  in preparation ; gdel , padgett , & dougados 2007 ) mapped @xmath028 square degrees ( all of which are encompassed by the spitzer area ) , and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ( finkbeiner et  al .",
    "2004 ; padmanabhan et  al .",
    "2008 ) mapped @xmath048 square degrees in two perpendicular strips , about half of which overlaps the spitzer area .",
    "finally , the five college radio astronomy observatory ( fcrao ) millimeter wavelength survey ( goldsmith et  al .  2008 ) mapped @xmath0100 square degrees in the co(1 - 0 ) line , covering the spitzer survey area entirely .",
    "the relative coverages of these surveys is shown in p09 .",
    "our extended collaboration has already begun to use this rich dataset to search for new members of taurus ; scelsi et  al .",
    "( 2007,2008 ) identified new candidate members using the xest data , and guieu et  al.(2006 , 2007 ) identified new brown dwarf members using the cfht data to study their disk properties using the spitzer data .",
    "ongoing investigations include searches for members via emission line spectra ( knapp et  al .",
    ", in prep ) , herbig - haro ( hh ) objects ( stapelfeldt et  al.in prep ) , and transition disks ( mccabe et  al .  in prep ) .    in this paper , we select new candidate taurus members with infrared excesses using spitzer and two - micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ; skrutskie et  al .",
    "2006 ) data .",
    "we construct color - magnitude and color - color diagrams for point sources , then use the locations of previously - identified young stars in these diagrams to select new candidate members with infrared excesses . to discard obvious extragalactic sources ,",
    "we examine the source morphology in all available bands of the multiwavelength taurus survey .",
    "we construct spectral energy distributions ( seds ) from the photometry over all available bands , again discarding objects we believe to be galaxies .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy has been obtained to assess whether or not our new candidate taurus objects are likely taurus members",
    ". we also present spitzer flux densities for the 215 previously - identified members found in the region covered by our spitzer survey .",
    "note that ( a ) the 215 previously - identified objects include those members without infrared excesses identified via other mechanisms ; ( b ) the 215 previously - identified objects are those covered by our spitzer map  there are other legitimate taurus members outside the region we observed , such as in l1551 ; ( c ) our new candidate member list is necessarily just those with ir excesses and exclusively within the regions covered by our spitzer observations . some objects are resolved in one or more of the spitzer images , and extended source photometry may be a better representation of the complete flux from the object ; many of the extended sources are discussed individually in other papers ( e.g. , tobin et  al .",

    "section  [ sec : pickysos ] describes our young stellar object ( yso ) selection process which is based on the colors of previously - identified taurus members , also presented here .",
    "we describe 34 objects that we have , thus far , identified as new members of taurus ( plus 3 probable new members and 10 possible new members ) in  [ sec : discussion ] and discuss the properties of the new objects in conjunction with ( and comparison to ) the previously - identified members of taurus .",
    "finally , we summarize our main points in  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the appendix contains spectral energy distributions and discussion of some specific objects .",
    "p08 and p09 present a comprehensive discussion of the spitzer data acquisition , reduction , and bandmerging to the 2mass data . in summary",
    ", we conducted the observations using irac ( infrared array camera ; 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , & 8 @xmath2 m ; fazio et  al .",
    "2004 ) and mips ( multi - band imaging photometer for spitzer ; 24 , 70 , & 160 @xmath2 m ; rieke et  al .",
    "2004 ) in two epochs to enable removal of asteroids from the final point - source catalog .",
    "the observations were spread over three observing programs and three years , 2005 to 2007 .    for irac , we used mopex ( mosaicking and point source extractor ; makovoz & marleau 2005 ) to find the sources , and idl to perform aperture photometry at those locations . with our irac observations , we sacrificed redundancy for spatial coverage , and obtained just 2 irac frames per position ( total integration time of 25.2 seconds ) , so instrumental artifacts are abundant .",
    "we discarded single - band ( apparent ) detections as likely artifacts .",
    "objects that we measured to be brighter than the 0.6 sec saturation limits ( 630 , 630 , 4600 , and 2500 mjy at the four irac channels ) we took to be saturated , and these appear as lower limits in our catalog .",
    "the zero - points we used to convert between flux densities and magnitudes were as found in the irac data handbook on the ssc website : 280.9 , 179.7 , 115.0 , and 64.13 jy for irac s four channels , respectively .    for mips",
    ", we used mopex point - response - function ( prf ) fitting photometry at 24 and 70 @xmath2 m .",
    "the total integration time at 24 @xmath2mwas 30 seconds per position ; the mips scan legs were interleaved to provide complete coverage at 70 @xmath2 m , and a total integration time of 15 seconds per position .",
    "we took objects brighter than 4.7 jy at 24 @xmath2 m  and 6.5 jy at 70 @xmath2 m  to be saturated ( or at least non - linear ) .",
    "these objects appear in our catalog as having lower flux density limits . following the mips data handbook on the ssc website ,",
    "the zero - points that convert between flux densities and magnitudes are 7.14 and 0.775 jy for mips-24 and 70 .    the observations at 160 @xmath2 m  present special challenges .",
    "all of the things that can affect the other bands ( such as saturation , extended emission , confusion with the cloud background and nearby objects  whether they be taurus or background objects  and instrumental artifacts ) , also affect this band . because the taurus cloud emission and instrumental effects are both very strong , and because the resolution is the poorest of all the spitzer bands , these items are of particular concern at this bandpass . additionally , due to scattered data gaps in our 160 @xmath2 m  map ( see p08,p09 ) , measurements ( or limits ) at 160 @xmath2 m  are missing or compromised for some sources .",
    "mopex does not detect any point sources automatically at 160 @xmath2 m , because all detected point - like objects appear to be slightly resolved . for @xmath0100 objects that were apparent by eye in the 160 @xmath2 m  image ( or for which limits",
    "were of interest for this paper ) , we performed aperture photometry on the cleaned image which was smoothed by a 4 pixel median filter to minimize the influence of holes in the map and image artifacts .",
    "we used a 32@xmath3 aperture , an annulus from 64 - 128@xmath3 , and an aperture correction of 1.97 ( valid for temperatures between 500 and 2000 km  is likely to be cooler than this , but the aperture correction changes only by 0.7% between this temperature range and 50 k , well within the uncertainties . ] ) .",
    "based on a comparison of the flux densities obtained from the filtered image and the unfiltered image , we took the flux density uncertainties to be 20% below 5  jy and 30% for higher flux densities .",
    "some objects that fell in regions with too many missing flux density values ( from saturation or gaps in the map ) are not retrievable and thus do not have a measurement ( or limits ) ; in essence , they are off the edge of the map . visual inspection of each 160 micron source was used in order to determine whether the object was clearly detected as a single point source , confused with another nearby source , or contaminated by data dropouts and/or saturation issues which would cause the reported flux density to be a lower limit ; these are indicated in the data tables below .",
    "the zero - point for mips-160 is 0.159 jy , again from the mips data handbook on the ssc website .",
    "we extracted @xmath4@xmath5  data from the 2mass point source catalog for our region , retaining flux densities only for those objects with high - quality 2mass data flags .",
    "there were a handful of objects of interest for this paper for which we made the following manual modifications , and therefore these modified values were used for the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) and spectral energy distributions ( seds ) below .",
    "measurements for five objects did not meet the data flag criteria we imposed on the 2mass catalog , but their as - reported flux densities were completely consistent with the rest of their sed , so we adopted their measurements as good detections ; these objects are sst tau 041542.7 + 290959 , 041542.7 + 290959 , 042517.6 + 261750 , 043835.4 + 261041 , and 043354.7 + 261327 .",
    "flux densities for one or more bands for the following previously - identified taurus members do not exist in the point source catalog , and thus the flux densities used below were taken from the extended source catalog : sst tau 042757.3 + 261918 , 044112.6 + 254635 , 043535.3 + 240819 , and 043316.5 + 225320 .",
    "we bandmerged all the available point sources between 2 and 70 microns using position matching alone , with a wavelength - dependent maximum matching radius .",
    "sources between 2 and 8 @xmath2 m  were matched over a radius of 1@xmath3 , and at 24 @xmath2 m , the matching radius to the rest of the catalog was 2@xmath3 .",
    "all matching radii are values empirically determined by inspection of histograms of nearest neighbors between bands , and spot - checking individual sources ; histograms of positional offsets and additional discussion appears in p09 .",
    "we pre - merged the 24 and 70 @xmath2 m  catalogs before merging to the rest of the catalog using an empirically - determined radius of 10@xmath3 .",
    "because the spatial resolution of the 70 @xmath2 m  images is so much worse than the 2 @xmath2 m  images , often more than one nir ( or optical ) source can be matched to the 70 @xmath2 m  source ; however , it is extremely likely that if we detect a source at 70 @xmath2 m , it will also appear at 24 @xmath2 m , so by implementing the pre - merge of 24 and 70 @xmath2 m , we are preferentially matching the 70 @xmath2 m  sources to a likely physical match .",
    "we include here a brief aside on the accuracy of blind merging by position . in the generic case of surveys across wavelengths ,",
    "relative astrometric accuracy and spatial resolution is paramount . in our case of a catalog primarily driven by spitzer+2mass sources ,",
    "astrometric accuracy is not the dominant source of error , since each instrument is internally consistent and calibrated to the 2mass coordinate system . for many star - forming regions studied with spitzer , e.g. , many of those observed by the cores - to - disks ( c2d",
    "; evans et  al .  2003 ) and gould s belt ( allen et  al .  in preparation ) projects , the source surface density is high enough that blind merging by position causes an unacceptable rate of false matches , and multiple short - wavelength sources should in reality be assigned to a single long - wavelength source .",
    "however , the source surface density in taurus is low enough ( @xmath04 sources per square arcminute , compared to @xmath020 in some star - forming regions ) that source confusion in general is not as much of a concern . on the other hand , in taurus ,",
    "many objects are known to be close binaries , and we do not apportion the flux density we observe between the two objects ; for close binaries , we have treated the object as single here . in any case , in three of the objects investigated in detail for this paper ( @xmath61% of the objects investigated , @xmath60.5% of the total number of 70 @xmath2 m  sources in the entire catalog ) , we determined by individual inspection that the 24/70 flux densities were incorrectly matched to a nearby faint short - wavelength source , rather than the correct , bright , slightly farther away , short - wavelength source . in these cases , we manually tweaked the flux assignment ; the position change is well within the expected uncertainties between the long- and short - wavelength catalogs .",
    "we are confident that for the large majority of the sources in our entire catalog , our blind merging by position works , but for any particular source not discussed here , the images and the flux assignment in our delivered catalogs should be carefully scrutinized .    in creating our spitzer - centric catalog",
    ", we dropped any object without a spitzer detection ( e.g. , sources off the edges of our maps ) before proceeding and after each additional merging step below ( e.g. , when combining the sdss catalog and the spitzer catalog , we did not retain sdss - only sources from off the edges of our map or whose sed falls so rapidly that they are too faint for our shallow spitzer survey ) .",
    "there are nearly 700,000 sources in the catalog with spitzer flux densities in at least one band .",
    "this does not include the asteroids , which will be discussed by hines et  al .",
    ", in preparation . it also does not include sources that are substantially extended ( except at 160 @xmath2 m , see below ) ; many of those will be covered by stapelfeldt et  al .",
    ", in preparation .",
    "the vast majority of the @xmath0700,000 sources are well behind the taurus molecular cloud .",
    "sources which are members are generally expected to be bright in the shorter bands and detected in multiple bands .",
    "p09 discusses the survey sensitivity in detail . in summary ,",
    "the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath2 m  sensitivities are quite comparable , and 98% of the objects detected in 3.6 @xmath2 m  are also detected at 4.5 @xmath2 m .",
    "the 5.8 and 8 @xmath2 m  channels are much less sensitive ; only 22% of the objects detected at 3.6 @xmath2 m  are also detected at 5.8 @xmath2 m , and just 17% of the objects detected at 3.6 @xmath2 m  are also detected at 8 @xmath2 m  ( where nebulosity can also be a factor in point source identification and extraction ) .",
    "our 24 , 70 , and 160 @xmath2 m  sensitivity is a strong function of position in the image because of nebular and high zodiacal dust emission contributions to the background . in part because of the varying background but also because of the effective sensitivity of the instrument to photospheres at the distance of taurus given our exposure times , just 1.4% of the objects detected at 3.6 @xmath2 m  are also detected at 24 @xmath2 m , and just 0.15% are detected at 70 @xmath2 m .",
    "the faintest independent 24 @xmath2 m  detection is @xmath010th mag ( @xmath0m2 spectral type photosphere at taurus age and distance ) , and the histogram of detections turns over at @xmath09.3 mags ( e.g. , there is a steep fall - off between [ 24]@xmath09.3 and 10 , where the bracket notation denotes the magnitude at that band ) .",
    "similarly , at 70 @xmath2 m , the faintest object is [ 70]@xmath03.5 , and a more typical value is 2.5 - 2.7 ( note that 70 @xmath2 m  is much more strongly affected by nebular emission and instrumental effects than 24 @xmath2 m ) .",
    "only o or b photospheres would be that bright at the distance of taurus , so we can only detect legitimate taurus objects at 70 ( or 160 ) @xmath2 m  which have substantial ir excesses .",
    "a full completeness analysis is given by p09 , but as another independent way of assessing our completeness , we examined by hand each of the images at each of the spitzer bands for each of the previously identified taurus members and new candidate taurus members discussed here ( see  [ sec : known ] and  [ sec : selectionoverview ] ) .",
    "if the object could be seen in the image but a flux density was not initially reported at that band , we made a manual assessment of the flux density or upper / lower limit , as appropriate .",
    "for irac , @xmath01 - 2% ( depending on the band ) of the previously identified taurus members and",
    "@xmath04 - 11% of the new candidate members were missing photometry and were filled in manually ( having lower signal - to - noise ) .",
    "the most common band in which flux densities were erroneously missing ( e.g. , not in the automatically generated catalog but visible in the images ) was 5.8 @xmath2 m , which is not particularly surprising , as this is the least sensitive of the irac bands .",
    "for mips , @xmath09% of the previously identified taurus members were missing photometry in either 24 or 70 @xmath2 m , and @xmath06% of the new candidate objects were missing photometry at 24 or 70 @xmath2 m . the lower fraction of missing photometry in the new candidate objects as compared to the previously identified objects is a reflection of the fact that our selection mechanism is somewhat biased towards objects with mips detections ; see  [ sec : newsamplesummary ] below .",
    "many sources detected at shorter wavelengths are undetected at longer wavelengths , and it is important for our science analysis to obtain upper limits for our sources in the spitzer photometric bands . for the list of coordinates of previously identified and new candidate taurus members , at 24 @xmath2 m , we used mopex to look for a source whose photometry could be obtained via prf - fitting at that location .",
    "if an object was detected , we took a weighted average flux density based on all detections ( e.g. , between epochs and tiles ) .",
    "if the final signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) was @xmath63 , we took the error to be the 1@xmath7 upper limit , and multiplied by 3 to get the 3@xmath7 limits found in the data tables below and seds in  [ sec : seds ] .",
    "if the prf fitting failed , we performed aperture photometry at the location of the object ( at each tile and epoch available ) , and took a weighted average of all the resultant positive aperture flux densities .",

    "if all the measured aperture flux densities were negative , we took the 1@xmath7 limit to be the straight average of the errors ( and multiplied by 3 to get the 3@xmath7 limits found in the tables and seds below ) . finally , still at 24 @xmath2 m",

    "upper limits at 70 @xmath2 m  for all remaining undetected sources were obtained by performing aperture photometry at the expected source location , using a 35@xmath3 aperture and a multiplicative aperture correction of 1.22 , as discussed in the mips data handbook , available at the ssc website .",

    "the previously - identified objects include known extragalactic objects , named objects of unknown nature , confirmed non - members , and potential ( unconfirmed ) members of taurus .",
    "to construct this list , we first searched in simbad over our entire field to obtain a list of @xmath08000 known objects . for objects that did not already have high - precision coordinates , we went back to the original article reporting the discovery of the object and attempted re - identification of the object using finding charts and 2mass images .",

    "new coordinates were reported back to the simbad team for inclusion in their database .",
    "we also included the results from several papers from the literature reporting specifically confirmed non - members .",

    "( 2008 ) , that failed a spectroscopic test for membership .",
    "they can also be spectroscopically confirmed background giants from studies of the ism ( e.g. , studies of the taurus dark cloud ) .",
    "these confirmed non - members have not necessarily been ingested into simbad , since they were not the primary scientific result of the paper .",
    "note that we did not list as non - members those objects merely assumed but not confirmed ( via spectroscopy ) to be background giants .",
    "we merged this list by position with our master catalog to identify objects seen in our survey . for each object for which a match was found in our catalog ,",
    "we went back to the original literature in an attempt to identify it as a known extragalactic object , a named object of unknown nature ( e.g. , objects from an all - sky survey where no specific follow - up has been done ) , a confirmed non - member ( as defined immediately above ) , or a potential ( unconfirmed ) member of taurus . in the case of objects from the literature listed as potential but unconfirmed taurus members , we noted and bookkept these objects separately , and we mention them where relevant below ; some are indeed recovered here by our spitzer - based searches for ysos .",
    "thus , the sample of taurus non - members is certainly biased and far from comprehensive and is _ defined _ to include mixtures of stars , other galactic objects ( such as planetary nebulae ) , and extragalactic objects .",
    "this sample can be indicative of some typical colors to expect from a variety of types of infrared - bright non - member objects .",
    "as a further diagnostic for non - members ( including extragalactic objects ) , we merged by position to the 2mass extended object catalog .",
    "objects in this catalog are likely but not guaranteed to be all extragalactic objects  11 ( out of 215 ) previously identified taurus members are also 2mass extended objects ( due to , e.g. , scattered light from extended dust structures ) , but 107/148 previously - known galaxies are 2mass extended objects .",
    "2mass extended object identifications , if relevant , are noted in the data tables and seds below .      in order to find new candidate taurus members , we first examined various color - color and color - magnitude spaces using our entire taurus catalog , highlighting the locations of the previously identified objects ( both members and non - members ) .",
    "we compared these diagrams to discussions in the literature also seeking to identify ysos from spitzer photometric measurements ( e.g. , allen et  al .",
    "2004 , padgett et  al .",
    "2008b , rebull et  al .",
    "2007 , harvey et  al .",
    "2007 , gutermuth et  al.2008 ) .",
    "there is no single color selection criterion that is 100% reliable in separating members from non - member contaminants .",
    "exactly which color selection criteria work best can be a strong function of the relative bandpass sensitivities and saturations , since 2mass , irac , and mips do not all detect the same faintest objects ( due not only to sensitivities but also degree of interstellar reddening and embeddedness of the young protostellar objects ) , or saturate for the same brightest objects .",
    "after extensive empirical investigation using diagrams from the literature as well as new diagrams , we selected four color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) and one color - color diagram ( ccd ) which provided the best diagnostics for ysos , and we used them to construct an initial list of new candidate ysos . in each diagram , we define regions most likely to harbor yso candidates , and regions most likely to contain galaxies or other non - members ; these are listed in detail in  [ sec : samplecriteria ] .    by imposing these color selections",
    ", we are selecting objects that have infrared excesses ( e.g. , flux densities above that expected for a photosphere ) and whose overall brightness is consistent with objects at the taurus distance .",
    "we interpret these excess objects as dusty objects , with circumstellar disks and/or envelopes .",
    "we do not select objects without infrared excesses .",
    "one aspect of our survey which makes it different from many of the spitzer - based surveys in the literature is our extensive optical imaging .",
    "while the sdss and cfht imaging data do not cover every square arcminute of the spitzer maps , they cover most of it . the sdss spatial resolution is only slightly better than the irac resolution at @xmath01.4@xmath3 , but the cfht data has much better spatial resolution at @xmath34 .",
    "we examined the images at all available bands for each of the nearly 900 objects meeting the color - color or color - magnitude criteria ( plus many more objects in the process of establishing these color spaces ) . at any band , if the object is a resolved galaxy , or projected in the vicinity of a galaxy cluster , we dropped it from further consideration .",
    "some of the objects that are resolved are actually previously - identified ysos .",
    "many of the objects that have spitzer colors similar to ysos turn out to be resolved galaxies when examined with sdss or cfht .",
    "these optical imaging data have been crucial to our ability to distinguish galaxies from yso candidates .    if the candidate object meets the color criteria in any one of the color - magnitude spaces we investigated and passes the imaging / spatial resolution test , we regard it as a provisional yso candidate , pending additional scrutiny discussed below .",
    "objects meeting the color criteria but failing the imaging / spatial resolution test are `` candidate non - members '' and appear separately in the figures below .",
    "previously identified taurus members tend to be bright , because previous infrared ( and optical ) surveys were shallower than our surveys .",
    "true new taurus members are also likely to be generally bright .",
    "very red ( embedded or cool ) objects could also be members , especially since this survey goes fainter in the infrared than any prior survey of the region ( excepting the spitzer gto observations in the various core regions , hartmann et  al .",
    ". however , the fainter objects are also statistically more likely to be galaxies , especially over our survey area of more than 44 square degrees at @xmath35 galactic latitude .",
    "thus , we specifically focused our attention on bright and/or red objects meeting our color selection criteria .",
    "faint red objects meeting our color selection criteria were also considered but are statistically more likely to be galaxies than yso taurus members .",
    "in addition to the easily quantifiable spitzer magnitude and color criteria , we also individually assessed each candidate yso using qualitative judgments . these include but are not limited to : morphology in imaging data in each available band ; relative brightness at all bands from @xmath17 to 160 @xmath2 m ( e.g. , infrared excess , but optical too bright to be a taurus member ) ; amplitude of excess ; shape of sed ; apparent ( projected ) proximity to other previously identified taurus members ; apparent ( projected ) proximity to clearly - identifiable galaxies ( e.g. , appearing to be part of a galaxy cluster ) ; resolvable spiral arms or tidal tails ; previous identifications ( e.g. , with the 2mass extended source catalog ) ; estimated @xmath36  from the 160 @xmath2 m  map ( e.g. , objects seen in high extinction regions are likely taurus members ) ; and star counts ( a similar criterion to proximity to galaxies or estimated @xmath36 ) . these assessments were done over several weeks by groups of co - authors and resulted in increased appreciation of the range of contaminants , and more objects being identified as new likely galaxies .",
    "( see the appendix discussion on  8 @xmath2 m  pop - up objects , \"  [ sec : popups ] , for an example of a class of objects we rejected . )",
    "we looked critically at the shape of the excess above the photosphere , and if the excess appeared only at one band ( 8 or 24 @xmath2 m ) , we retained the object as a yso candidate only if it was more than 4@xmath7 above the photosphere ( see  [ sec : insignifirx ] for many of the rejected low - significance sources ) .",
    "for the surviving yso candidates , based on all of the available information from any wavelength ( spectroscopic as well as photometric , plus derived information such as placement in a theoretical hertzprung - russell diagram  see  [ sec : ldlstar ] ) as well as all the criteria listed above , we assigned a letter grade , a / b / c , with grades of `` a '' as more likely members than those with grades of `` c. ''    these qualitative criteria can fail to recover some of the previously - identified taurus members .",
    "several of the previously - identified taurus members do not have ir excesses and are therefore not recoverable by our search .",
    "seven of the previously - identified taurus members ( e.g. , 042146.3 + 265929 or 042307.7 + 280557 ) would probably have been rejected because in the optical images , these objects are in front of a field of galaxies , i.e. , they appear to be part of a galaxy cluster , and are not in a high @xmath36  region .",
    "one additional previously identified member , the well - known edge - on disk iras 04302 + 2247 ( = sst tau 043316.5 + 225320 ) , was temporarily identified as a galaxy because its appearance was so unusual in the optical image . while our process is clearly imperfect , we are confident that , working as a group and using all of the available multi - wavelength information , we have identified a reasonably high - confidence sample of candidate taurus members present in our photometric catalog .",
    "our approach for finding ysos is customized to our data set .",
    "this labor - intensive process is not one that can be blindly applied to other regions , even regions where similar extensive supporting optical data are available .",
    "while our color selection can be easily applied to any spitzer+2mass catalog , the manual examination of each object is not necessarily easily duplicated and certainly automating this process is not currently possible . however , because our survey is wide - area , and the contamination rate is high , this process is unavoidable and has been crucial to our yso selection . the time we spent in vetting the candidate list enabled more efficient use of our follow - up spectroscopic telescope time , e.g. , there was little time wasted in taking spectra of contaminants .",

    ", we performed a simple ordinary least squares linear fit to all available photometry ( just detections , not including upper or lower limits ) between 2 and 24 @xmath2 m , inclusive .",
    "note that errors on all of the infrared points are so small as to not affect the fitted sed slope , and that a forthcoming paper will investigate the ( small ) effects of fitting a line to all available points within a different wavelength range , e.g. , 3.6 to 24 @xmath2 m . in the spirit of wilking et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we define @xmath46 , where @xmath47 for a class i , 0.3 to @xmath370.3 for a flat - spectrum source , @xmath370.3 to @xmath371.6 for a class ii , and @xmath481.6 for a class iii .",
    "we realize that the precise definition of @xmath1 can vary , resulting in different classifications for certain objects ; detailed discussion of this issue is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "classification via this method is provided for all previously identified and new candidate objects specifically to enable comparison within this paper via internally consistent means .",
    "adopted spectral types appear in tables  [ tab : knownysot3 ] and [ tab : newysot3 ] .",
    "this spectral type comes from the literature ( see  [ sec : known ] ) or from our spectra (  [ sec : spectra ] ) ; if the latter , it is indicated as such in the `` notes '' column . if we obtained a spectrum for the object , and if h@xmath1 was measurable , we report the equivalent width in these tables ( see  [ sec : spectra ] for analysis details ) . if the ca infrared triplet was in emission at the time of our observation , it is noted in the `` notes '' column .    tables  [ tab : knownysot3 ] and [ tab : newysot3 ] include an estimate of the star s luminosity ( @xmath49 ) and an estimate of the ratio of the infrared excess luminosity to the star s total ( photospheric+infrared ) luminosity ( @xmath50 , where @xmath51 ) .",
    "we describe briefly our procedure to determine the infrared luminosity .",
    "many faint sources were undetected at the longest wavelengths ; we extrapolated missing data points for wavelengths longer than 8.0  @xmath2 m .",
    "we used the longest wavelength available data point as a reference and assumed that its flux density corresponded to blackbody emission peaking at that wavelength .",
    "we then used this blackbody function to estimate the missing fluxes at the longer wavelengths .",
    "we compared the measured @xmath52 colors and the expected photospheric @xmath53 colors ( as tabulated in chapter 7 of allen s astrophysical quantities ; cox 2001 ) , attributing any difference to extinction , @xmath36 , and we corrected the photometric fluxes for it .",
    "we obtained a spline curve through the corrected fluxes in @xmath54 , @xmath55 space on a wavelength grid from 0.1    to 1000    with a @xmath56   . to determine the infrared excess , we determined the underlying stellar photospheric emission using phoenix stellar atmosphere models for @xmath57  k and kurucz models for @xmath58  k and matched the stellar atmosphere model to the corrected @xmath59-band fluxes .",
    "the infrared luminosity was calculated by measuring the difference between the spline curve and the stellar atmosphere model .",
    "we emphasize that care was taken to ensure that we included only adequate excess luminosity contributions at each wavelength of the grid ( e.g. , if the stellar atmosphere model showed a drop in flux between the @xmath5  and @xmath60 m fluxes , and the spline curve was above but there was no obvious sign of infrared excess at those wavelengths , the contribution to the infrared luminosity was not included ) .",
    "we also only included contributions if the spline curve was at least 1.5 times larger than the stellar atmosphere contribution .",
    "finally , we determined if the calculated infrared luminosity was an upper limit by checking that at least one of the corrected photometric fluxes beyond @xmath60 m were real and not extrapolated .",
    "if the latter , the infrared luminosity was indicated as an upper limit .",
    "note that this method is subject to several caveats : ( a ) objects that do not have spectral types ( particularly common in the list of new candidate objects ) do not have a calculated @xmath36 , and therefore no @xmath61 or @xmath50 ; ( b ) this method of dereddening using @xmath52 ignores the potential for near - ir excess ( as well as veiling and the h - opacity minimum at 1.6 @xmath2 m ) and therefore this method can overestimate @xmath61 ; ( c ) ysos intrinsically vary at essentially all the wavelengths used here , and the photometry across the sed for each object was not obtained contemporaneously .",
    "our values for @xmath50 are probably good to a factor of 2 , and are sufficient to determine if a source has an envelope , is an optically thick disk only , a highly flattened / thinning disk , or a debris - like system .",
    "( see  [ sec : ldlstar ] for more discussion . )",
    "this approach is demonstrably inaccurate in comparison to more complex methods , such as those employing bolometric corrections to reddening - corrected flux densities in well - calibrated passbands .",
    "however , more detailed modeling is beyond the scope of this paper .    for the 148 new candidate taurus members , table  [ tab : newysot3 ]",
    "also contains an adopted membership classification indicating whether or not we regard the object as a taurus member .",
    "this classification combines information from all of the available photometric and optical spectroscopic data ( see  [ sec : newsamplesummary ] and  [ sec : gradations ] ) .",
    "extragalactic objects are noted as `` xgal . ''",
    "objects that we believe to be reliable new members are indicated as `` new member . ''",
    "objects that we think are likely to be new members but there is still some doubt are listed as `` probable new member . ''",
    "objects with the next gradation of confidence are `` possible new members .",
    "'' objects for which we have spectra but can not determine clear membership are listed as `` needs additional followup '' and , finally , objects with no spectroscopic data yet are  pending followup .",
    "\" there are 34 new members , 3 probable new members , 10 possible new members , 7 extragalactic objects , 2 other objects , 60 stars needing additional follow - up observations , and 33 pending any follow - up observations . note that while all the `` new members '' are also grade a objects , not all grade a objects are `` new members '' , because of the need for additional data in many cases .    a final data table , table  [ tab : newmembers ] , lists the new members in order of quality , sorted by their category ( new member , probable new member , possible new member , needs additional followup , or pending followup ) , and then by our rank ( and then by catalog number ) , such that the objects we grade as most likely to be new members appear at the top of the list .",
    "table  [ tab : newmembers ] also contains the projected angular separation from to the nearest previously - identified taurus object .",

    "for example , in the case of the 24/70 cmd , 447 objects are selected by our color cuts in this diagram . of these , 19% are previously identified ysos , 7% are new candidate ysos ,",
    "10% are previously identified non - members , and 60% are new non - members . and , out of the 215 stars that compose our previously identified taurus member sample ,",

    "this table reveals that the @xmath5/24 diagram recovers the highest fraction of previously identified objects and of new candidate objects .",
    "the 24/70 cmd finds the highest fraction of new non - members ( by fraction of objects found in this diagram as well as by fraction of the entire new non - member list ) ; this is not particularly surprising , as the objects that are detected at 70 @xmath2mtend to be either ysos or extragalactic objects .",
    "this table also shows that the @xmath06@xmath32 elais n1 swire sample is largely found outside of our color selection criteria ; few galaxies of the sort found in this swire sample are likely to be selected by our criteria .",
    "table  [ tab : sampleproperties1new ] shows , of the entire sample of previously - identified taurus members , essentially all are seen in at least one band of irac , most ( @xmath080% ) are detected in mips-24 , and just @xmath045% are seen at mips-70 .",

    "we also have a bias in that three of these color selections use 24 @xmath2 m  in some fashion ( either as overall brightness or as part of the color ) .",

    "these 4@xmath7 8 @xmath2mpoints seem to be real , in that the distribution of , e.g. , [ 3.6]@xmath37[8 ] colors are near zero for the overwhelming majority of stars in the catalog , and these objects are clearly redder than average .",
    "however , without detailed modeling beyond the scope of this paper , it is puzzling how objects could have legitimate , real 4@xmath7 excesses at 8 @xmath2 m  and small 24 @xmath2 m  excesses .",

    "these criteria can only be applied to 1% of the objects ( see table  [ tab : othermethods ] ) because of the multiband detection requirement . out of this 1% of the catalog , which is @xmath07100 objects ,",
    "21% are identified as yso candidates ( note that we did not manually examine the images of each of these objects in spitzer or any other bands , whereas the c2d team would have done so ) , 65% are identified as galaxies , and 14% are identified as stars .",
    "note that this does _ not _ mean that a c2d - selected yso candidate sample has 65% contamination , but rather that out of the objects in the catalog to which the c2d criteria can be applied , 65% of these objects are immediately categorized as galaxies . among our set of previously - identified taurus members ,",
    "154 can be classified , but 61 of them ( 29% ) can not be classified in this scheme because of missing bands .",
    "seven of them ( 3% ) are identified as galaxies or other contaminants .",
    "six of them ( 3% ) are classified as stars ( the likely wtts out of the sample ) , and 141 ( 92% ) are identified as ysos . as intended , this selection mechanism ( even as we have implemented it ) is strongly biased towards ysos .",
    "this sample of previously known ysos can not tell us about the contamination rate , but it can tell us about the fraction of objects that might be missed ; a c2d - based yso selection operating on this sample would miss @xmath05% of the ysos with detections in all the requisite bands and infrared excesses .",
    "the c2d classifications for these previously identified members are listed in table  [ tab : knownysot3 ] ; the same information for the new candidate members is in table  [ tab : newysot3 ] . among our new candidate objects ,",
    "perhaps unsurprisingly , there is a higher fraction of contaminants .",
    "the multi - band detection requirement means that 14% ( 20 objects ) can not be classified . among the remainder of the sample",
    ", there are 28 ( 19% ) likely galaxies ( or other contaminants ) , no stars ( which makes sense because we are only selecting objects with ir excesses ) , and 100 ( 68% ) likely ysos in this attempt to use the c2d criteria on our sample .",
    "happily , the yso candidates compose the largest fraction of our sample .    the c2d criteria require selection in each of the spitzer - based cmds or ccds ; our selection requires selection in just one of the cmds or ccds .",
    "we have noted above in  [ sec : newsamplesummary ] the effects of instead requiring selection in each of our cmds or ccds .",
    "we note again here that , aside from the previously identified members , the number of new potential members is comparable to the contaminant hit rate .",
    "the c2d criteria require a 24 @xmath2 m  detection and we are strongly biased towards objects with a 24 @xmath2 m  detection , so this is perhaps not surprising .",
    "gutermuth et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) , in their section 4.1 and appendix , describe a multi - step weeding process .",
    "they require detection in all four irac bands for most of the process , although they allow for semi - manual addition of objects missing some bands .",
    "the number of sources that can be considered as input for this process which appears in table  [ tab : othermethods ] attempts to represent this semi - manual addition ; there are 89003 objects seen at all 4 irac bands , and 76522 that are seen at jh@xmath5[3.6][4.5 ] but not [ 5.8 ] or [ 8 ] , and these two components represent the bulk of the sources that can be considered . additional provision is made in this method for bright , red objects detected at [ 24 ] but not all four irac bands , and for stars with 24 @xmath2 m  excess ; since this represents addition of a few thousand sources to the 165525 sources already considered , a @xmath31 symbol is used in the table .",
    "the gutermuth method also works in dereddened colors for some criteria , requiring a high - spatial - resolution @xmath36map , which we do not have and thus can not implement exactly in a parallel fashion .",
    "we note too that the gutermuth et  al .",
    "criteria relies mostly on the [ 4.5]@xmath37[5.8 ] color to avoid effects of reddening that may be found at 3.6 @xmath2 m .",
    "since the overall median @xmath36  towards taurus is low ( @xmath36@xmath03 , which has a very small effect on 3.6 @xmath2 m ) , we did not deredden our colors , and simply applied the gutermuth et  al .",
    "criteria to our observed colors .",
    "we did not semi - manually add objects to the list following their section 4.2 , and we added a few criteria to remove some blue objects found in our catalog ; to their `` embedded '' criteria , we added an additional [ 5.8]@xmath37[8]@xmath8@xmath370.5 and [ 3.6]@xmath37[4.5]@xmath8@xmath370.5 , and to their `` class ii '' criteria , we added [ 3.6]@xmath37[4.5]@xmath8@xmath370.5 .",
    "two of the many color parameter spaces that gutermuth et  al .",
    "use are the same as ours ; see table  [ tab : othermethods2 ] .",
    "differences between the gutermuth criteria and ours include the following : ( 1 ) only two cmds are the same between the methods , ( 2 ) the gutermuth method sometimes uses the intersection of the color spaces ( like c2d ) and sometimes takes selection in just one color space as sufficient ( like us ) , ( 3 ) the gutermuth method provides for a semi - manual addition of likely yso objects , based on color cuts , ( 4 ) the gutermuth method does not require intensive manual examination of multi - band images , ( 5 ) the gutermuth method , though multi - step , can be applied to any spitzer+2mass catalog of a star - forming region , and is not dependent on products of pipelines or the presence of ancillary data ( modulo reddening corrections ) , and ( 6 ) the gutermuth method , as properly applied , needs an @xmath36  map and needs to work in dereddened colors . in order to attempt a comparison using the best possible criteria ,",
    "we have imposed the same basic color cuts , and , because of the low overall @xmath36  towards taurus , we have continued to work in the observed color space , and not dereddened anything .",
    "we have not semi - manually added objects to the yso candidate list ( as per gutermuth s phase 2 or phase 3 ) .",
    "because of the multi - band detections necessary , these criteria can not be applied to most of the entire @xmath0700,000 object catalog ; even with the semi - manual addition of sources allowed for in this method , between 50 - 75% of the catalog do not have enough detections to be included ( see table  [ tab : othermethods ] ) , but the process of semi - manual addition of sources is likely to catch most legitimate ysos in the catalog . the sample with 4-band irac detections",
    "is easiest to handle automatically , and out of this sample , 83% are dropped as stars , 16% are dropped as contaminants of any of a variety of kinds , 282 ( 0.3% ) are embedded objects ( class 0/i or flat ) , and 291 ( 0.3% ) are class ii objects . among our set of previously - identified taurus members , 28 of them ( 13% )",
    "can not be classified because of missing bands .",
    "just 2 are dropped as contaminants and 82 ( 38% ) are classified as stars ; 15 ( 7% ) are identified as `` embedded '' and 87 ( 41% ) are identified as class ii . again , as intended , this selection mechanism ( even as we have implemented it ) is strongly biased towards ysos .",
    "the gutermuth et  al .",
    "classifications ( in more finely - grained detail ) for the previously known objects are in table  [ tab : knownysot3 ] and those for our new candidate members are listed in table  [ tab : newysot3 ] . among our new candidate objects ,",
    "95% can be considered , 76 ( 51% ) are classified as stars , 5 ( 3% ) are contaminants , and 60 ( 41% ) are yso candidates ( 21 objects are identified as embedded and 39 are identified as class ii ) .",
    "there is a slightly higher fraction of contaminants in the new sample than among the previously identified sample .",
    "we note that the overwhelming majority of objects that we dropped as a result of the review described in  [ sec : gradations ] were classified as contaminants using the gutermuth classifications .",
    "we also note that the classification that we derive from a fit to all available points between @xmath5  and 24 @xmath2 m  is in good agreement with the gutermuth et  al .  sed classification except in higher - extinction situations , as expected .",
    "comparing the different methods is clearly not at all straightforward .",
    "the differences are much more than simply different data reduction methods ( aperture vs.  psf - fitting photometry ) or survey depths .",
    "the different color spaces that each study investigates , and the different assumptions that are made ( e.g. , orring vs.  anding the color selection ) can be seen most clearly in the different results when considering the set of previously identified taurus members .",
    "since not all of the previously identified taurus members have strong ir excesses , it is not surprising that no spitzer - based method retrieves all of them .",
    "interestingly , the gutermuth et  al .",
    "selection mechanism returns a higher fraction of previously identified members without infrared excesses than the c2d method .",
    "direct comparison of the ysos retrieved in this paper ( or over the taurus molecular cloud as a whole ) to any other association is not easy because the selection methods are so different .",
    "unfortunately , numbers from this study can not simply be dropped into tables from these other studies .",
    "even if we were to re - reduce our data in exactly the same way as the other studies , a direct comparison would be difficult .",
    "even the contaminant rates are hard to compare .",
    "since all of the follow - up data has yet to be acquired for our candidate objects , it is hard to do a final assessment of our contamination rate . out of the 80 objects with spectra reported here , at least 45% are new members , and at least 10% are contaminants .",
    "over 44 square degrees , including the previously identified plus the new confirmed objects , we recover at least 4.3 ysos per square degree , and at least 0.18 contaminants per square degree .",
    "the c2d method was derived primarily using the c2d observations of serpens ( and swire ) , and harvey et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) estimates of order 0 - 1 contaminants in their 0.85 square degrees . scaling this up to our @xmath044 square degree map",
    ", we then would expect @xmath050 contaminants in our map using the c2d method !",
    "oliveira et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) carry out follow - up spectroscopy for the c2d serpens sample , and find higher contamination ( 25% ) than was originally estimated in harvey et  al .",
    "however , these contaminants are primarily agb stars , which should not be as much of a contaminant source in the taurus map , given the lower galactic latitude of serpens ( 5@xmath32 ) as compared with taurus ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "gutermuth et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) estimate @xmath01 contaminant left in their 40@xmath8330@xmath84(=0.33 deg@xmath85 ) map .",
    "scaling up to 44 square degrees , then we would expect @xmath0130 contaminants .",
    "however , we expect that the actual contamination is much less because this method has been tested on several maps , including larger ones .",
    "as more follow - up data are obtained for this and the other associations , a more direct comparison of the complete yso inventories in these clouds will eventually be possible .",
    "rebull et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) and cieza & baliber ( 2007 ) found a correlation between irac excesses and rotation rates in orion and ngc 2264 .",
    "taurus is one of the first associations in which rotation of young stars was studied ( see , e.g. , edwards et  al .",
    "1993 ) , but there are still only 32 stars with measured periods ( see gedel et  al .  2007 , and references therein , and grankin et  al .",
    "2008 ) and irac photometry in our catalog .",
    "figure  [ fig : rotation ] shows the rotation rate against disk excess for those stars .",
    "the relationship seen here , where the slowest rotators are much more likely than the fast rotators to have disks , is consistent with what has been found in the other associations .",
    "we have presented here spitzer flux densities for 215 previously - identified members of the taurus molecular cloud young stellar object population .",
    "we constructed spitzer color - color and color - magnitude diagrams , investigated where the previously identified taurus members were located , and then used those diagrams to select additional candidate taurus objects out of a catalog of @xmath0700,000 objects observed with spitzer over 44 square degrees .",
    "we used a wealth of supporting data ( including ground - based optical imaging ) to winnow that list down to 148 candidate new taurus members .",
    "we obtained follow - up optical spectroscopy for about half the sample , thus far finding 34 new members , 3 probable new members , and 10 possible new members , a potential increase of 15 - 20% of young taurus members .",
    "most of the new members are located in close ( projected ) proximity to the previously - identified taurus members ; most of them are class ii m stars .",
    "in addition to the new members in our sample , there are 60 stars needing additional follow - up observations , and 33 objects pending any follow - up observations at all , so more taurus members may yet be confirmed out of our list of candidate members .",
    "we also found a background be star , a new planetary nebula , a new carbon star , many background giants , and 100s of galaxies , just 7 of which made it into our final list of 148 yso candidates .",
    "as part of this project s classification as a spitzer legacy project , enhanced data products have been delivered back to the spitzer science center ( ssc ) , including the catalogs on which this present paper is based .",

    "<S> we report on the properties of pre - main - sequence objects in the taurus molecular clouds as observed in 7 mid- and far - infrared bands with the spitzer space telescope . </S>",
    "<S> there are 215 previously - identified members of the taurus star - forming region in our @xmath044 square degree map ; these members exhibit a range of spitzer colors that we take to define young stars still surrounded by circumstellar dust ( noting that @xmath020% of the bonafide taurus members exhibit no detectable dust excesses ) . </S>",
    "<S> we looked for new objects in the survey field with similar spitzer properties , aided by extensive optical , x - ray , and ultraviolet imaging , and found 148 candidate new members of taurus . </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained follow - up spectroscopy for about half the candidate sample , thus far confirming 34 new members , 3 probable new members , and 10 possible new members , an increase of 15 - 20% in taurus members . of the objects for which we have spectroscopy , </S>",
    "<S> 7 are now confirmed extragalactic objects , and one is a background be star . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining 93 candidate objects await additional analysis and/or data to be confirmed or rejected as taurus members . </S>",
    "<S> most of the new members are class ii m stars and are located along the same cloud filaments as the previously - identified taurus members . among non - members with spitzer colors similar to young , </S>",
    "<S> dusty stars are evolved be stars , planetary nebulae , carbon stars , galaxies , and agn . </S>"
