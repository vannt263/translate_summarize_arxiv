    "reflection principles_. a reflection principle is , roughly , a statement establishing that for a certain class of structures , if the structure satisfies a given property , then there is a substructure of smaller cardinality that satisfies the same property .",
    "reflection principles can be seen as versions of downward lowenheim - skolem theorem and they derive from large cardinal notions such as the notion of strongly compact cardinal .",
    "magidor and shelah introduced in 1994 ( see @xcite ) a two - cardinals reflection principle , denoted @xmath3 where @xmath4 ( see the definition in section  [ sec : prelim ] ) .",
    "this is a strong reflection principle as it implies many interesting properties of structures of various kind .",
    "for instance , given a cardinal @xmath5 if @xmath6 holds , then every almost free abelian group of size @xmath7 is free ; if @xmath3 holds for every @xmath4  we say that @xmath7 has the _ delta reflection _  then for every graph @xmath8 of size @xmath5 if every subgraph of smaller size has coloring number @xmath9 then @xmath8 itself has coloring number @xmath10 similar properties hold for other kind of structures under the assumption that @xmath7 has the delta reflection ( see @xcite and @xcite ) . it should be pointed out that these statements are always true when @xmath7 is a singular cardinal ( see @xcite ) , thus we are interested in those _ regular _ cardinals that satisfy the delta reflection .",
    "the delta reflection implies another classical reflection principle , namely the _ stationary set reflection _ which for a cardinal @xmath7 established that for every stationary subset @xmath11 of @xmath7 of points of cofinality less than @xmath12 there exists @xmath13 such that @xmath14 is stationary in @xmath15 since the stationary set reflection fails at the successor of a regular cardinal , in particular the delta reflection can only hold at successors of singular cardinals .",
    "the delta reflection follows from weakly compact cardinals , however magidor and shelah showed in @xcite that it is consistent that a small cardinal , namely @xmath16 has the delta reflection , assuming zfc is consistent with the existence of infinitely many supercompact cardinals .",
    "moreover , the results proven in @xcite , combined with other older results by eklof @xcite , milner and shelah @xcite , @xcite , imply that @xmath0 is the smallest regular cardinal that can have the delta reflection .",
    "recent work by the first author and magidor @xcite shows that @xmath0 can even satisfy simultaneously the delta reflection and the tree property , which is another strong reflection principle ( more precisely , assuming zfc is consistent with the existence of infinitely many supercompact cardinals , then zfc is consistent with @xmath0 having both the delta reflection and the tree property ) ; on the other hand , it is shown in @xcite that the delta reflection at @xmath0 does not imply the tree property at this cardinal ( nor the tree property implies the delta reflection ) , thus the delta reflection and the tree property are independent .    in this paper",
    "we show that , assuming the consistency of infinitely many supercompact cardinals , it is possible to force a model of zfc where @xmath0 satisfies simultaneously the delta reflection and a version of the square , denoted @xmath17 ( see the definition in section  [ sec : prelim ] ) .",
    "introduced by todorevi in @xcite , @xmath18 is an anti - reflection principle on a cardinal @xmath7 .",
    "for example , as demonstrated in @xcite , @xmath18 implies the failure of the tree property at @xmath19 it also implies the failure of the simultaneous reflection , namely every stationary set can be split into two disjoint stationary parts such that there is no ordinal @xmath20 in which they are both stationary ( see velikovi @xcite ) .",
    "rinot @xcite proved that an even stronger failure of the simultaneous reflection follows from @xmath21 namely any stationary subset of @xmath7 can be partitioned into @xmath7 many pairwise disjoint stationary sets such that no two of them reflect simultaneously .",
    "it follows by a result of solovay @xcite that @xmath22 fails if there is a @xmath23-strongly compact cardinal , so in a way the existence of a @xmath22 sequence bounds the amount of downward reflection that we can get on structures of size @xmath23 .",

    "the delta reflection implies the failure of the weak square @xmath26 which is another weak consequence of @xmath25 ( hence a fortiori the delta reflection implies the failure of @xmath25 ) , thus our result implies that one can have at @xmath0 a good balance between a reflection principle and an anti - reflection principle .",

    "therefore we restore the supercompactness of any indestructible @xmath107-supercompact from the ground model .",
    "in particular , the threading forcing restores the delta principle at singular limits of supercompact cardinals .",
    "so , in order to get the delta reflection together with the square principle , we must argue that if , by contradiction , the delta reflection fails before we force the thread , then the counterexample would be preserved by the threading forcing .",
    "there are two difficulties when trying to work in this direction .",
    "the first problem is the following : although @xmath136 is indestructible under @xmath107-directed closed forcing ( because @xmath23 is a singular limit of indestructible supercompact cardinals ) , we do not know if such indestructibility can hold for @xmath140 .",
    "second , the forcing that adds a thread to a @xmath139 sequence always destroys stationary sets .",
    "this is problematic since it may happen that before we force the thread , the delta reflection fails , and after the threading forcing , all the `` bad '' stationary sets that do not reflect are destroyed . in other words , the threading forcing may resurrect the delta reflection .",
    "the approach that we suggest in order to get around the second problem is to force a square sequence and then define a preparatory forcing iteration .",
    "such an iteration destroys the bad stationary sets in a way that will make the threading forcing generically preserve stationary sets .",
    "namely , we can find for every stationary set a generic filter for the threading forcing such that in the generic extension the set remains stationary . in this way , if a given stationary set was a counterexample for the delta reflection principle , then by using the distributivity properties of the threading forcing , we will get that there is a generic filter for the threading forcing such that in the generic extension the stationary set remains a counterexample for the delta reflection .",
    "therefore , it will be enough to show that the delta principle holds after the threading forcing .",

    "<S> starting from infinitely many supercompact cardinals , we force a model of zfc where @xmath0 satisfies simultaneously a strong principle of reflection , called @xmath1-reflection , and a version of the square principle , denoted @xmath2 thus we show that @xmath0 can satisfy simultaneously a strong reflection principle and an anti - reflection principle .    </S>",
