    "minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) have many flat directions , along which there are no classical potentials .",
    "the flat directions are only lifted by soft susy breaking mass terms and non - renormalizable terms .",
    "such flat directions have several interesting consequences in cosmology such as baryogenesis and q - ball formation . in affleck - dine mechanism for baryogenesis",
    ", a complex field along a flat direction ( ad field ) has a large field value during inflation .",
    "after inflation the ad field starts to oscillate when its mass becomes larger than the hubble parameter @xmath0 . at that time the ad field obtains velocity in the phase direction because of the baryon number violating operator , and the baryon number is generated very efficiently .    for inflation models in which the accelerated cosmic expansion is caused by a f - term potential",
    ", the ad field generally obtains an effective mass of the order of @xmath0 through supergravity effects during inflation . in this case , the expectation value of the ad field @xmath1 is determined by the balance between mass term @xmath2 and the non - renormalizable term where @xmath3 is order one constant .",
    "if the mass term is positive ( @xmath4 ) as expected from minimal supergravity , the potential takes minimum at @xmath5 and the ad mechanism does not work . thus the supergravity effects must lead to negative mass term ( i. e. @xmath6 ) for baryogenesis in f - term inflation models .",
    "supersymmetric inflation models are also constructed with use of d - term potential . in the d - term inflation models supergravity effects",
    "do not induce @xmath7 mass terms and the ad field has only soft susy breaking mass term of the order of weak scale .",
    "thus , the ad field can have a large expectation value during inflation , which makes the ad baryogenesis work .",
    "since the effective masses of the ad field in d - term inflation models are much smaller than the hubble parameter during inflation , the ad field has large fluctuations which may give some contribution to the density fluctuations of the universe . in the previous work  @xcite ,",
    "the fluctuations of ad field was considered and it was pointed out that the the fluctuations of the ad field change the spectral index of the adiabatic fluctuations produced in the d - term inflation , from which the expectation value of the ad field is constrained . the authors in refs .",
    "@xcite also pointed out that the small expectation value of the ad field during inflation leads to lager isocurvature ( baryon ) perturbations which are induced by the fluctuations in the phase direction of the ad field .",
    "however , their estimation of the adiabatic fluctuations was too naive , and one needs careful treatment for the multi - field dynamics .    in this paper , we reconsider the ad field fluctuations in the d - term inflation model .",
    "we find that the spectrum of the adiabatic fluctuations is almost scale invariant even if the ad field has a large initial value .",
    "furthermore , we study the isocurvature fluctuations of the ad field and estimate the ratio of the isocurvature to adiabatic power spectrum .",
    "it is shown that the recent cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data give a constraint on the model parameters of d - term inflation and the ad field .",
    "let us discuss the dynamics of the ad and inflaton fields in the d - term inflation model .",
    "the flat direction corresponding to the ad field can be lifted by soft susy breaking mass term and the non - renormalizable term coming from the superpotential given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the reduced planck mass , @xmath10 is an @xmath11 coupling constant , and @xmath12 is the ad field .",
    "then , the potential is written as  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the soft mass , @xmath15 is the mass of gravitino , and @xmath16 is an @xmath11 complex constant . the dimension @xmath17 is an even number , and the cases of @xmath18 are considered in this paper .",
    "note that the ad scalar @xmath19 should be less than @xmath20 , otherwise the potential can not be described as eq .",
    "( [ eq : adp ] )    the tree - level scalar potential for d - term inflation is given by @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the coupling constant of the interaction between @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the fayet - illiopoulos term , and @xmath26 is the @xmath27 gauge coupling . though the global minimum of this potential is at @xmath28 , @xmath29 , the local minimum is at @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "we can take @xmath23 real using the @xmath27 phase rotation .",
    "with use of @xmath32 , for @xmath33 , the potential of @xmath34 up to a 1-loop correction is given by  @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is a renormalization point .",
    "if the potential is dominated by @xmath38 , @xmath34 is related to the number of e - folds ( of inflation ) @xmath39 , @xmath40 assuming that the present scale crosses the hubble radius at @xmath41 during inflation , the cobe normalization ( @xmath42 ) fixes @xmath43 if @xmath19 starts with @xmath44 , the potential is dominated by the f - term of the ad field .",
    "then there arises @xmath7 mass term for the inflaton due to supergravity effects , and it rapidly rolls down to its true minimum .",
    "therefore inflation does not occur at all in this case . in order to have a successful inflationary model",
    ", @xmath45 must be less than @xmath46 , which is given by @xmath47 for @xmath48 , the universe is dominated by the d - term of the inflaton field .",
    "( say , @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) . in any case",
    ", the ad field value is set below @xmath51 along the same argument , once the d - term driving inflation begins .",
    "] thus the d - term driving inflation accounts for the necessary @xmath52 e - folds .",
    "this gives @xmath53 .",
    "then it is easy to show that the slow roll condition for @xmath34 is satisfied , @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are slow roll parameters  @xcite .",
    "once the inflation begins , the ad field rapidly oscillates with a decreasing amplitude .",
    "when the amplitude of the oscillation becomes small enough ( @xmath57 ) , @xmath19 begins to slow - roll .",
    "@xmath51 is obtained by solving @xmath58 : @xmath59 therefore , the expectation value of the ad field @xmath19 at the horizon exit of the present scale is generally less than @xmath60 .",
    "thus , we have an upper limit to @xmath19 , @xmath61 note that this upper limit to the ad field value is totally due to its dynamical property and the requirement that an inflation should occur , not any observational constraint .",
    "next , we calculate the fluctuations of the ad field @xmath19 and inflaton @xmath34 . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the gauge - invariant curvature perturbation @xmath62 is given by @xmath63 where into @xmath38 and @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : const ] ) .",
    "we have checked eq .",
    "( [ eq : const ] ) by numerical calculation as shown in fig.[fig : spectrum ] . ]",
    "@xmath65 is the growing adiabatic mode , and @xmath66 is the isocurvature mode . for @xmath67 , @xmath68 is dominated by @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "hence @xmath71 . in other words ,",
    "the main contribution to the adiabatic fluctuation comes from the inflaton .",
    "therefore the primordial spectrum is almost scale - invariant as usual . with this approximation ,",
    "the primordial spectrum is given by @xmath72 where @xmath73mpc .    in order to check the above estimate",
    ", we also solve the evolution of zero modes and fluctuations of the ad and inflaton fields and the gauge - invariant curvature perturbation @xmath74 by numerical calculation , following ref.@xcite .",
    "we present the evolution equations in synchronous gauge as @xcite @xmath75 @xmath76 where @xmath16 is the scale factor , @xmath77 , @xmath78 is the curvature perturbation , @xmath79 is the total momentum current potential , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the total pressure and energy density , and @xmath82 .",
    "the gauge - invariant curvature perturbation @xmath62 is given by @xmath83 we have found that the above analytic solution eq.([eq : analytic ] ) agrees well with the numerical results .",
    "these two primordial spectra are plotted in fig.[fig : spectrum ] . from fig.[fig : spectrum ] , one can see that the analytic solution ( the solid line ) agrees with the numerical results very well , which support the validity of the approximation used above .",
    "+    the spectral index is given by @xmath84 substituting eq.([eq : bph ] ) ( or eq.([eq : analytic ] ) ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : index ] ) , the spectral index @xmath85 on cobe scales @xmath86 we have also obtained @xmath87 from our numerical calculation . note that @xmath88 is implied by present cmb observations and hence the cmb observation does not restrict any parameters in this model as opposed to the result in ref .",
    "this discrepancy is due to the incorrect estimation of the gauge invariant @xmath89 in ref .",
    "@xcite where @xmath89 is given by @xmath90 on the other hand , the accurate form of @xmath89 is given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 is an anisotropic stress perturbation .",
    "hence only if we take the flat slicing and an anisotropic stress perturbation can be neglected , then the first equality in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wrong ] ) is satisfied .",
    "it is also worth noting that the dynamics of the perturbed system can not be described by one equation for @xmath89 when more than one scalar field are involved  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the expression ( [ eq : wrong ] ) is based on @xmath95 . however , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are classical random quantities , and the correct expression is @xmath98 , where @xmath99 means ensemble average .",
    "the results of numerical calculation for the time evolutions of @xmath89 and @xmath100 during inflation are plotted in fig.[fig : zeta ] . as seen in fig.[fig : zeta ] , the two quantities are not proportional to each other .",
    "during inflation , the fluctuation of the phase @xmath101 of the ad field is given by @xmath102 after baryogenesis by the ad mechanism , the fluctuation of @xmath101 becomes baryonic isocurvature perturbation  @xcite . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the baryon number density @xmath103 is proportional to @xmath104 .",
    "thus the isocurvature fluctuation with comoving wavenumber @xmath105 is given by @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the density parameter of baryons ( total matter ) , @xmath108 is the time when the given mode crosses the hubble radius during inflation . on the other hand , both the ad field and the inflaton",
    "generate the adiabatic fluctuation given by @xmath109 where @xmath110 is an arbitrary time .",
    "to compare these two types of fluctuations , it may be natural to consider the ratio of the power spectra at horizon crossing , i.e. , @xmath111 , which is written as  @xcite @xmath112 it is also useful to consider the ratio @xmath113 of the present power spectra  @xcite .",
    "the present power spectrum can be described as @xmath114 where the transfer functions ( @xmath115 ) are normalized as @xmath116 .",
    "the ratio @xmath113 is defined as @xmath117 actually , @xmath113 is related to @xmath118  @xcite by @xmath119 . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : efolding ] ) , ( [ eq : upper ] ) , and ( [ eq : ratio ] ) , we obtain a lower limit for @xmath113 as @xmath120 where @xmath121 is given by @xmath122 if we take @xmath123 and @xmath124 , this lower limit is approximately given by @xmath125 if @xmath1260.1 and @xmath127 , then @xmath128 for the @xmath129 case . according to @xcite , the best - fit value defined as eq.(6 ) in  @xcite is related to our definition of @xmath113 as follows .",
    "@xmath130 we adopt the model ( 10 ) in @xcite , because both adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations are almost scale - invariant in our model . ] of @xmath113 is @xmath131 .",
    "finally , we have constraints on @xmath26 , @xmath10 , and @xmath101 : @xmath132 thus , the large coupling constants can be excluded for @xmath129 . on the other hand , the constraint for @xmath133 ( and @xmath134 ) is not severe at all .",
    "it is noticed that the value of the ad field during inflation can be smaller than that used here for some initial conditions because the ad field may oscillate before inflation .",
    "for this case , the constraint becomes more stringent .",
    "in this paper we have considered the adiabatic and isocurvature fluctuations of the ad field in the d - term inflation model , and have found that there exists an upper limit for ad field due to its dynamical property and the requirement that an inflation should occur . the primordial spectrum has been calculated analytically and numerically , and has been found to be of the familiar harrison - zeldovich type . while the adiabatic fluctuations of the ad field do not make any significant contribution , the isocurvature fluctuations of the ad field can generate baryonic isocurvature perturbations .",
    "the upper bound for the ad field in turn leads to the lower limit for isocurvature fluctuation as eq.([eq : lower ] ) . taking account of the observational constraints on isocurvature perturbations from boomerang and maxima-1 , we had interesting constraints on some combinations of @xmath26 , @xmath10 , and @xmath101 , especially in the case of @xmath129 .",
