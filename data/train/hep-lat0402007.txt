    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is playing an increasingly relevant and unifying role in high energy physics . from a purely theoretical point of view",
    ", susy is required for consistency and finiteness in superstring theory ; compactification and susy breaking mechanisms are then needed in order to produce a low energy four - dimensional effective action with a residual @xmath0 susy .",
    "this constraint comes from the phenomenological side where the most popular current extensions of the standard model are actually based on susy for at least two reasons .",
    "first , supersymmetric grand unification theories are quite successful in predicting @xmath1 gauge couplings unification  @xcite , a fact that can be considered as the main phenomenological motivation for susy  @xcite .",
    "moreover , supersymmetric models solve in a natural way the hierarchy problem  @xcite of matching the electroweak and gut scales without being spoiled by huge radiative corrections to higgs masses .",
    "however , many features of this scenario still need some clarification .",
    "indeed , @xmath0 susy is expected to be exact at the gut scale around @xmath2 gev , but must be broken in the tev region in order to account for the asymmetric mass textures that are currently observed .",
    "in particular , this will be true if some superpartner with a mass of a few tev will be observed in the future lhc or linear collider experiments . in the model independent analysis , the source of breaking",
    "is usually parametrized by a complete set of soft terms whose origin remains however rather unexplained .    in several approaches ,",
    "it is due to some kind of spontaneous breaking of susy in a _ hidden _ sector and communicated to the mssm particles producing the soft terms . as with every dynamical symmetry breaking , non - perturbative techniques must be exploited and the lattice regularization and renormalization programme is of course one of the main lines of research .",
    "indeed , the simultaneous introduction of infrared and ultraviolet cutoffs allows for calculations , like strong - coupling expansions , that are quite complementary to the usual weak - coupling perturbative analysis .    beside this , when any known analytical treatment fails , lattice models can also be studied by direct simulations that can provide , in principle , accurate numerical measurements .    in this paper , we address the problem of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking ( s@xmath3b ) in a simple , but interesting , theoretical laboratory that is the class of wess - zumino ( wz ) two - dimensional models of chiral superfields with no vector multiplets .",
    "preliminary results on this subject can be found in  @xcite .",
    "related studies of the two dimensional wess - zumino model can be found in @xcite .    despite their simplicity ,",
    "these systems are nontrivial because in two dimensions supersymmetry is not strong enough to predict the exact pattern of breaking , a situation that must be compared with the four dimensional case where wz models are expected to break supersymmetry if and only if they do at tree level .",
    "unfortunately , as we shall discuss , lattice strong - coupling expansions provide useful insights , but are unable to reliably predict the physics of the continuum theory and one must resort to a numerical analysis .    since s@xmath3b is closely related to the symmetry properties of the ground state , it appears to be quite reasonable to adopt some kind of hamiltonian formulation .",
    "moreover , we will see in the following that , if we wish to preserve a susy subalgebra , a conserved hamiltonian is crucial .",
    "however , the traditional algorithms for simulation of lattice field theories are based on the lagrangian formulation  @xcite .",
    "the main reason is the immediate probabilistic interpretation of the partition function , at least for bosonic systems not suffering from a sign or phase problem ; this leads to a host of monte carlo algorithms , some of which are extremely efficient .",
    "of course , alternatives based on a more direct hamiltonian formalism do exist  @xcite , but they are certainly less exploited in high energy physics where emphasis is on lagrangian symmetries , in particular poincar invariance .",
    "on the other hand , hamiltonian methods has been used in supersymmetric discretized light - cone quantization ( sdlcq )  @xcite and also are widely exploited in non relativistic contexts  @xcite where the properties of the ground state are typically the simplest and first object of investigation . moreover , these techniques interlace the brute force numerical calculations with analytical or physical insights about the structure of the ground state wave function , a feature that is quite welcome in the study of s@xmath3b where we expect major changes to show up at the phase transition .    another important feature of our study concerns the fact that fermions , needed in supersymmetric models , are the major source of complications in the current approaches to lattice simulations . in the lagrangian approach quantum expectation values are computed by summing over histories of the classical fields , following feynman s ideas . in the case of fermions , these are grassmann valued _ classical _ fields that can not be analyzed by direct numerical methods .",
    "the typical solution amounts to integrate them out and study the resulting non - local bosonic model  @xcite .",
    "this can be nontrivial for a generic model and a recent detailed account of this problem and whether it can be formulate successfully supersymmetric theories on the lattice can be found in  @xcite .    instead , in the hamiltonian approach , what is relevant is the algebra of the fields and their conjugate momenta . from this point of view ,",
    "fermions and bosons differ just by the replacement of commutators by anticommutators and also by the structure of the state space , finite dimensional for fermions in finite volume , infinite dimensional in the bosonic case .",
    "apparently , in the hamiltonian approach , there is much more symmetry in the treatment of fermions and bosons than in the lagrangian approach .",
    "looking at the details of the simulation techniques , however , problems arise with hamiltonian fermions due to the well known hard sign problem  @xcite . roughly speaking ,",
    "fermion exchanges introduce problematic and unavoidable signs that often break in a substantial way the probabilistic interpretation of quantum expectation values required to build a numerical stochastic algorithm .",
    "this deep problem is somewhat milder in @xmath4 dimensions where specific equivalences between fermionic and bosonic fields can be established  @xcite . also , the topology of fermion dynamics is the simplest possible and helps in taming the sign problem .",
    "actually , for several fermion models in @xmath4 dimensions arising in solid state theory , like , e.g. , hubbard - like models , algorithms can be devised with no sign problem and good efficiency as well as scaling properties  @xcite .",
    "the detailed plan of the paper is the following : in sec .",
    "( [ sec : model ] ) we present the model and its lattice hamiltonian ; in sec .",
    "( [ sec : sc ] ) we compute the first nontrivial order of the strong - coupling expansion of the ground state energy ; in sec .",
    "( [ sec : rg ] ) we discuss the renormalization group trajectories along which a continuum limit can be reached . in sec .",

    "finally , sec .",
    "( [ sec : results ] ) is devoted to present our numerical results .",
    "let us consider the most general susy algebra in two dimensions .",
    "the generators are split into fermionic and bosonic ones .",
    "the algebra with @xmath7 left - handed fermionic generators @xmath8 and @xmath9 right - handed fermionic generators @xmath10 is denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "the bosonic generators are the components of the two - momentum @xmath12 and a set of central charges @xmath13 .",
    "the non trivial part of the algebra is @xmath14 in the left - right symmetric case with @xmath15 , we denote @xmath16 and find @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the pauli matrices , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the minimal realization of this algebra requires a single real chiral multiplet with a real scalar component @xmath21 and a majorana fermion with components @xmath22 .",
    "the explicit form of the supercharges is @xmath23 , \\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the momentum operator conjugate to @xmath25 .",
    "the central charge corresponds to a topological quantum number  @xcite @xmath26 as usual with supersymmetric models , the structure of the hamiltonian @xmath27 guarantees that the energy eigenstates have @xmath28 because @xmath29 invariant states annihilated by both @xmath30 coincide with the zero energy states and are thus supersymmetric ground states ; they must lie in the topologically trivial sector .",
    "the problem of predicting the pattern of @xmath31 is not easy . in principle",
    ", the form of @xmath32 is enough to determine whether supersymmetry is broken or not . at least at tree level",
    ", one easily proves that supersymmetry is broken if and only if @xmath33 has no zeros . in two dimensions ,",
    "however , these conclusion is generally false due to radiative corrections .",
    "an analytic non - perturbative tool that can help in the analysis is the witten index defined as  @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the fermion number .",
    "since supersymmetry is not explicitly broken , contributions from positive - energy bosonic and fermionic states cancel and @xmath36 in finite volume , @xmath37 is invariant under changes in @xmath32 that do not modify its asymptotic behaviour . in particular , it can be computed at weak coupling where each zero of @xmath32 is associated to a perturbative zero energy state .",
    "thus , if @xmath32 has an odd number of zeroes , we find @xmath38 and supersymmetry is unbroken . if , on the other hand , @xmath32 has an even number of zeroes , the associated perturbative vacua can contribute @xmath37 with opposite signs and , when @xmath39 , we can not say anything .",
    "in particular , a nontrivial set of perturbative zero energy states with @xmath39 can receive instanton corrections due to tunneling lifting them to positive energies breaking supersymmetry while leaving @xmath39 . in such cases ,",
    "the behaviour of the tunneling rate with increasing volume is crucial in answering the question of breaking .",
    "an interesting example of this complicated scenario is discussed in appendix a of ref .",
    "we quickly review the analysis since it will be important in the interpretation of our results .",
    "when @xmath40 , the action of the wz model is @xmath41 for large positive @xmath42 the index is zero because there are no zero - energy states . due to a special conjugation symmetry valid for this model in finite volume , the pattern of breaking is invariant under @xmath43 .",
    "this means that for negative @xmath42 , the two zeroes of @xmath33 are bosonic and fermionic and ( finite volume ) tunneling lifts their energy to a positive value .",
    "however , in infinite volume and large negative @xmath42 , the narrow minimum of the potential is protected from radiative corrections and generates an expectation value @xmath44 signaling the ssb of the @xmath45 symmmetry @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "the fermion becomes massive and supersymmetry must be unbroken due to the absence of a massless goldstino .",
    "the above discussion illustrates that an alternative non - perturbative analysis of the models with @xmath39 is certainly welcome . in the following",
    ", we shall put the model on a space - time lattice in order to exploit explicit numerical simulations as well as analytical strong - coupling expansions .      on the lattice",
    "it is impossible to maintain the full susy algebra and it is important to understand what can be said by looking at subalgebras . if we consider one supercharge only , for instance @xmath48 , and find a state with @xmath49 , we can not say that it is a zero energy state unless we know that it is in the @xmath50 sector . on the other hand , if no states with @xmath49 are found in any topological sector , then supersymmetry is certainly broken .",
    "thus , even if we forget @xmath51 , we can choose as a clear - cut signal of supersymmetry dynamically breaking the lowest eigenvalue of the operator @xmath52 : if it is positive , we have breaking .",
    "the susy algebra ( [ susy ] ) involves explicitely the generators of space and time infinitesimal translations and is spoiled on the lattice . in the lagrangian approach ,",
    "both space and time are discrete and susy is completely broken . in the hamiltonian formulation ,",
    "time remains continuous and the @xmath53 algebra is reduced to @xmath54 and not totally lost .",
    "the full two - dimensional algebra as well as lorentz invariance are expected to be recovered in the continuum limit .",
    "a lattice version of the above model has been previously studied in refs .",
    ". a similar approach to wess - zumino models with @xmath55 supersymmetry is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and numerical investigations are reported in ref .",

    "@xmath27 describes an interacting model , symmetric with respect to @xmath68 and this symmetry is respected by the spectrum if and only if the ground state energy is positive .",
    "we stress again that @xmath68 symmetry breaking implies breaking of the full 2 dimensional supersymmetry , whereas @xmath68 symmetry does not imply ( in a generic topological sector ) 2d susy .",
    "we remind that , on the lattice , spontaneous supersymmetry breaking can occur even for finite lattice size @xmath56 , because tunneling among degenerate vacua connected by @xmath68 is forbidden by fermion number conservation .",
    "to write @xmath27 in a more familiar form , we follow ref .",
    "@xcite and replace the two majorana fermion operators with a single dirac operator @xmath69 satisfying canonical anticommutation rules , i.e. , @xmath70 , @xmath71 : @xmath72 the hamiltonian takes then the form @xmath73 and describes canonical bosonic and fermionic fields with standard kinetic energies and a yukawa coupling .",
    "this hamiltonian conserves the total fermion number @xmath74 and can be examined in each sector with definite @xmath75 separately . for reasons that will be understood later",
    ", we shall also consider open boundary conditions and restrict the lattice size @xmath56 to be even .",
    "these are constraints that do not affect the physics of the model in the continuum , but will be very welcome by the algorithm we are going to apply .",
