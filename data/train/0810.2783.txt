    "entanglement is one of the fundamental but counterintuitive aspects of quantum mechanics@xcite . a basic trait of entangled , or quantum correlated , systems is that a measurement on one subsystem of the composite system determines the state of the other , independently on their separation .",
    "entangled systems can also be characterized by the presence of quantum correlations that can not be simulated by any classical local model@xcite . however , while for pure states the presence of entanglement always corresponds to the presence of nonlocal quantum correlations ( nlqcs)@xcite , this is not the case for mixed states ; in fact it has been demonstrated that there are bipartite entangled mixed states whose correlations admit a classical local model@xcite .",
    "these nlqcs are unambiguously identified by violations of bell inequalities@xcite .",
    "these violations have been confirmed by several experiments@xcite and are crucial for some applications in quantum information@xcite , such as to guarantee the safety of device - independent key distribution protocols in quantum cryptography@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , realistic quantum systems present unavoidable interactions with their environment@xcite that , during the evolution , give rise both to decoherence and to entanglement losses , turning any initial pure state into a mixed one .",
    "although these two processes appear to be related , it has been shown that two initially entangled qubits , each locally interacting with a corresponding environment , formed by a zero temperature memoryless ( markovian ) bosonic reservoir , may be subjected to `` sudden death''@xcite . in this process ,",
    "the qubits become disentangled at a finite time , in contrast to the single qubit exponential decoherence .",
    "this phenomenon has been recently experimentally confirmed@xcite .",
    "interest therefore arises in finding physical conditions and methods able to protect entanglement .",
    "recently , methods aimed at extending the entanglement storage time have been proposed .",
    "they make use of environments with memory ( non - markovian ) , where entanglement revivals occur@xcite , of quantum zeno effect@xcite , or of structured environments like photonic crystals , where entanglement can be trapped@xcite .",
    "we shall consider a system composed by a couple of qubits , each embedded in a bosonic reservoir , evolving independently to examine the connection between violation of a bell inequality and single - qubit excited state population .",
    "we shall study the special case when the environment is such that sufficiently high population trapping occurs ( as in photonic - band gap materials@xcite ) , to see if a long - time protection of nonlocal entanglement , as identified by bell inequality violations , is achievable .",
    "we begin by considering a bipartite system made of two identical independent two - level atoms ( qubits ) each embedded in a zero temperature bosonic environment .",
    "we indicate the two qubits with @xmath0 and @xmath1 , each having ground and excited states @xmath2 , @xmath3 separated by a transition frequency @xmath4 .",
    "a crucial point for our study is to obtain the two - qubit reduced density matrix at the time @xmath5 .",
    "this can be accomplished by exploiting a procedure based on the knowledge of the single - qubit dynamics@xcite .",
    "the fact that the two parts `` qubit+environment '' evolve independently allows to write the time evolution operator of the composite system as a tensor product of two terms relative to the two parts .",
    "this in turn leads to the fact that , given the time - dependent single - qubit density matrix elements as @xmath6 , @xmath7 , the time - dependent two - qubit density matrix elements result of the form@xcite @xmath8 where the indexes @xmath9 .",
    "the condition of independent evolution is applicable also to the case of common environment provided that the atoms are at a distance larger than the spatial correlation length of the reservoir and such that the dipole - dipole interaction can be neglected .    for each part",

    "when the environment is at zero temperature the single - qubit reduced density matrix @xmath18 can be written , in the basis @xmath19 , as@xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 represents the single - qubit population of excited state at time @xmath5 and @xmath22 is the population parameter .",
    "the previous equation shows that the single - qubit dynamics depends only on @xmath23 .",
    "the two - qubit density matrix @xmath24 is then obtained by means of eq .",
    "( [ totalevo ] ) , its elements depending only on their initial values and on the function @xmath23 . in the following these density matrix elements will be meant in the standard two - qubit basis @xmath25 .",
    "in order to individuate when the entanglement is nonlocal we have to choose a bell inequality and look for its violations . here",
    "we shall exploit the well - known clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) form of the bell inequality@xcite .",
    "the chsh - bell inequality is the most extensively used among the bell inequalities .",
    "the reason of this relies on the fact that it is experimentally testable@xcite and that for the case of two spin - like measurements ( two measurements with two outcomes per each ) any other bell inequality is equivalent to the chsh - bell one@xcite .",
    "let the operator @xmath26 be a spin - like observable with eigenvalues @xmath27 associated to the qubit @xmath28 , defined as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the unit vector indicating a direction in the spin - like space and @xmath31 the pauli matrices vector .",

    "is then obtained as a function of @xmath23 from the evolved two - qubit state @xmath24 .",

    ", we consider the case when the two - qubit density matrix at time @xmath5 has an `` x '' structure , that is having non - zero elements only along the main diagonal and anti - diagonal . this has been shown to happen if the initial two - qubit density matrix has itself an `` x '' structure : in fact this form is preserved during the time evolution due to the hamiltonian @xmath43 , where @xmath44 @xmath45 is the single qubit - environment hamiltonian of eq .",
