    "the separated lines of thermally activated absorption are distinctly seen in the temperature range 15 - 20 k , at lower temperatures the intensity is weak because of the spin gap , and at higher temperatures the lines merge into a single line . no absorption signal corresponding to the singlet - triplet transitions is observed .",

    "[ fig:150ghzvart ] and [ fig:300&276ghz ] ) corresponds approximately to the known esr spectrum of a powder and crystal samples with @xmath2 ions in an axial crystal field ( see , e.g. , ref . ) . for a uniaxial crystal , this esr spectrum , in case of @xmath37 , consists of three resonance lines corresponding to the transitions @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "two resonance lines , corresponding to @xmath39 , have larger intensity and are on both sides from the free spins resonance field @xmath42 .",

    "@xmath22 is a single ion anisotropy constant contributing to the single ion hamiltonian with the term @xmath46 .",
    "naturally , for a powder sample there should be a band of absorption instead of resonance lines , the whole band width is @xmath43 , and the maxima of absorption are near the resonance field of crystallites with @xmath47 because of their largest statistical weight ( the field interval between maxima is again @xmath45 ) . in case of the easy plane anisotropy the intensity of the lower field maximum is larger than that at the upper one because of a higher population of the lower spin sublevels . for the case of the easy axis",
    "anisotropy the relation between the intensities should be inversed .",
    "applying the above consideration of @xmath2 magnetic ion in a crystal field we conclude , that the effective anisotropy of the triplet excitations is of the easy plane type ( @xmath48 ) . according to ref .",
    ", @xmath49 and @xmath22 are of different signes , thus , the single - ion constant @xmath22 should be negative , which agrees with the easy axis anisotropy of the impurity induced ordered phase .",

    "alternatively , energy levels of the triplet excitations can be calculated within the boson model,@xcite which imply 3d ordering above the critical field .",

    "note that the energy levels predicted in refs . , and by use of the perturbative model@xcite ( @xmath67ghz and @xmath68590 ghz )",
    "does not correspond the above experimental data to any extent .",
    "thus , the experimental esr frequencies are in a agreement with the energy levels predicted by the macroscopic theories , @xcite , rather than with the theory considering isolated haldane chains.@xcite      we performed a model calculation of the esr absorption for the powder sample of a spin gap magnet with gapped triplet excitations ( see figs .",

    "the population numbers for the @xmath70 and @xmath17 spin sublevels of a triplet excitation mode were calculated according to the plank s distribution function .",
    "the effective anisotropy constant , equal to the zero field splitting of a triplet sublevels is defined as    @xmath71    here @xmath72 and @xmath73 are zero - field cyclic frequencies of the triplet excitations carrying effective spin projection @xmath74 equal to @xmath75 or zero correspondingly .",
    "we calculated the microwave absorption for effective spins @xmath2 in a uniaxial crystal field according the standard esr procedure , i.e. calculating transition frequencies , matrix elements of the transitions and difference of the population numbers @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the triplet excitations in zero field is taken in the form @xcite :    @xmath76    with @xmath77 , @xmath78=4895 ghz ( ref . ) , and @xmath79= 440 ghz , @xmath80=590 ghz derived from the fields @xmath81 and @xmath61 according to ref .",
    "as shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : levnew ] .",
    "the field dependences of @xmath82 are derived as the energies of corresponding sublevels of an effective spin @xmath2 in a crystal field with the anisotropy constant @xmath83 .",
    "this modeling also provides the low - field @xmath84 transition , which is allowed in the canted orientations of the magnetic field with respect to anisotropy axis .    for the second method we used the excitations frequencies , given by the macroscopic models.@xcite",
    "these frequencies can be calculated for an arbitrary @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( see appendix ) in the low frequency approximation @xmath87 .",
    "since this model does not provide information on matrix elements of the transitions , which are necessary to calculate intensity of the corresponding esr absorption , we have used this model only at high fields taking the matrix elements for @xmath88 transitions to be equal and field independent .",
    "population numbers of the exited states were taken according to the plank s distribution function again .    the model microwave absorption due to the excitations with the energy at the bottom of the zone ( q=0 )",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] along with the model absorption curve at t=15  k , when the excitations away of the zone bottom are also excited .",
    "despite of the smaller value of @xmath49 of the high energy excitations , the peaks of absorption remain at the same positions due to a large spectral density at the zone bottom . at heating ,",
    "the absorption curve becomes asymmetric with enlarging of the intensity in the field range , corresponding to resonance for smaller @xmath49 , as predicted in ref . .",
    "for modeling of the esr absorption of the ceramic samples , we made the averaging over the random orientations of crystallites and , again , over the one - dimensional @xmath89-space .",
    "the calculated lineshape , presented by the dashed curve on fig .",
    "[ fig:300ghz ] corresponds qualitatively to the observed line , if we subtract the central peak of absorption , produced by the defects , as shawn on the fig .",
    "it should be noted that the singularity in the form of the step of absorption is close to the maximum of absorption for the single-@xmath90 calculation , both singularities are due to the maximum of the statistic weight of the crystallites with the four fold axis perpendicular to the magnetic field . for the @xmath90-space integrated absorption the steps are at the same positions , while the maxima are smeared due to the contribution of the higher energy excitations which have smaller value of @xmath91 .",
    "the results of the modeling are practically independent on the natural esr linewidth changing in the range 110 ghz .",
    "the temperature dependence of the triplet esr field observed in the present work may be , probably , attributed to an interaction between the triplets , analogous to the spin - wave frequencies in conventional ferro - and antiferromagnets , which is known to be renormalized with excitation of magnons ( see , e.g. , refs . and ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of the triplet excitation spectrum was observed also for the dimer spin - gap compound tlcucl@xmath27.@xcite an alternative reason for the temperature dependence of @xmath49 and the triplet excitation spectrum may be the change of the correlation length with heating .",
    "however , according to experiments @xcite , the correlation length is reduced only for 20 % at the temperature of a half of the intrinsic haldane gap @xmath92 , as in our case .",
    "apparently , this may not substantially change the effective anisotropy constant of triplet excitations .",
    "the excitation of the triplets apart from the bottom of the excitation spectrum also may not change the position of the absorption maxima , despite they should have smaller @xmath49 . as noted in ref .",
    ", the influence of higher energy excitations will result in an asymmetric form of the esr lines but not in the shift of the absorption maximum .",
    "in conclusion , the esr spectrum of triplet excitations in a haldane magnet pbni@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1  demonstrates a temperature dependence , probably , due to the interaction between the excitations .",
    "esr of triplet excitations is satisfactory modeled without fitting parameters , using the experimental values of critical fields .",
    "the relation between the critical fields and energy gaps corresponds to the boson model of ref .   and macroscopic theory@xcite and contradicts the fermion model of ref .   and isolated chain calculations of ref .  .",
    "this indicates , supposedly , a strong influence of the 3d correlations on the spectrum of excitations in pbni@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
