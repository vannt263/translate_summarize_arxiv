    "after the celebrated discovery of neutrino masses and mixings during the last two decades  @xcite , current and upcoming neutrino experiments are now on the brink of taking the next big step : the observation of @xmath0 noninvariance in neutrino oscillations  @xcite .",
    "theory predicts that such leptonic @xmath0 violation manifests itself in at least one nonvanishing phase , @xmath1 , in the lepton mixing matrix  @xcite ; and ongoing long - baseline experiments such as no@xmath5a  @xcite and t2k  @xcite prove to become increasingly sensitive to this observable .",
    "recently , the no@xmath5a collaboration , e.g. , reported their newest constraints on the @xmath0-violating phase @xmath1  @xcite , which illustrate that no@xmath5a is now capable of excluding certain values of @xmath1 at the level of @xmath6 . moreover ,",
    "planned long - baseline experiments such as dune  @xcite will be able to actually measure @xmath1 over a large range of possible values .    from the viewpoint of theory ,",
    "these recent developments as well as experimental prospects directly lead to the question : what can we possibly learn about the properties of the standard model ( sm ) neutrinos from measuring a certain amount of @xmath0 violation in neutrino oscillations ? in this paper , we are going to attempt to answer this question in the context of a specific , minimal neutrino mass model : the type - i seesaw mechanism  @xcite including two right - handed neutrinos .",
    "the seesaw mechanism is arguably one the most popular explanations of the sm neutrino masses . at the cost of a minimal extension of the sm particle content",
    ", it manages to account for all observed low - energy neutrino phenomena , while in addition offering the possibility to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe as a consequence of baryogenesis via leptogenesis  @xcite . traditionally , the seesaw mechanism supposes the existence of three right - handed neutrinos , @xmath7 with @xmath8 , that transform as complete singlets under the sm gauge group . in this standard scenario ,",
    "all three sm neutrinos acquire small nonvanishing masses , the differences between which are then described by the observed solar and atmospheric mass - squared differences , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this realization of the seesaw mechanism , however , comes with a large number of undetermined parameters at high energies , which makes it difficult to derive destinct predictions for the neutrino observables accessible at low energies . a possible way out of this problem is to assume certain ( discrete ) flavor symmetries that restrict the set of allowed leptonic interactions in the lagrangian , thereby reducing the number of free parameters  @xcite .",
    "this approach is well motivated and has attracted ( and continues to attract ) a great deal of attention in the literature . on the other hand",
    ", the concept of flavor symmetries often times requires a large number of additional scalar fields in order to achieve certain yukawa structures .",
    "this increases the particle content and , hence , overall complexity of the seesaw mechanism at high energies , which may make it even harder to experimentally pin down its underlying dynamics at a fundamental level .",
    "an intriguing and , in fact , quite orthogonal alternative to this approach is to simply reduce the number of right - handed neutrinos from three to two  @xcite . in this case",
    ", one has to deal with three complex yukawa couplings or , equivalently , six real parameters less . as a consequence ,",
    "one sm neutrino remains massless , while the masses of the other two neutrinos are readily fixed by @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this realization of the seesaw mechanism is , thus , significantly more predictive than the standard scenario involving three right - handed neutrinos .",
    "in addition , it nicely conforms with the philosophy of occam s razor  @xcite , which commands us to always give preference to explanations that rely on the least number of assumptions . to explain the current low - energy neutrino data , one actually does not _ need _ to introduce three right - handed neutrinos .",
    "lacking knowledge of the absolute neutrino mass scale , two right - handed neutrinos are absolutely sufficient . likewise ,",
    "leptogenesis calls for two right - handed neutrinos , but not necessarily more  @xcite .",
    "two ( nondegenerate ) right - handed neutrinos are sufficient to render the decays of the heavy @xmath7 in the early universe @xmath0-noninvariant , as required by the sakharov conditions for successful baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "a third right - handed neutrino is not essential .",
    "these observations motivate us to focus on realizations of the seesaw mechanism featuring two rather than three right - handed neutrinos in this paper . at high energies",
    ", the sm lagrangian then needs to be supplemented with the following yukawa and mass terms , @xmath11 here , the first term accounts for the yukawa interactions of the right - handed neutrinos with the sm lepton and higgs doublets , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , while the second term contains majorana masses , @xmath14 , for the right - handed neutrinos , which , w.l.o.g .",
    ", we can take to be real and diagonal .",
    "meanwhile , the yukawa couplings @xmath15 form an arbitrary complex @xmath16 matrix",
    ". the main goal of this paper will be to study the implications for the yukawa matrix @xmath15 , provided that leptonic @xmath0 violation should be conclusively observed in the future .",
    "general seesaw models involving three right - handed neutrinos predict the existence of , in total , three physical @xmath0-violating phases in the lepton mixing matrix : one dirac phase @xmath1 , which is always present and which may be regarded as the analog of the complex phase in the quark mixing matrix  @xcite , as well as two additional phases , @xmath2 and @xmath17 , owing to the majorana nature of the sm neutrinos in the context of seesaw models . in the case of only two right - handed neutrinos , one of these two majorana phases ( say , @xmath17 )",
    "can , however , be absorbed by a neutrino field rotation , so that only two phases end up being physical : @xmath1 and @xmath2 . here",
    ", @xmath1 can be measured in neutrino oscillation experiments , while @xmath2 enters into the effective neutrino masses probed in searches for neutrinoless double - beta decay ( such as gerda  @xcite ) or in experiments aiming at a direct neutrino mass determination ( such as katrin  @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we are now going to study the possible hierarchy structures and textures in the yukawa matrix @xmath15 in dependence of the @xmath0-violating phases @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "to this end , we will adopt a two - step strategy : first , we will introduce a convenient measure that characterizes how close a given yukawa matrix is to a certain flavor texture . then , we will perform a systematic parameter scan of the model in eq .   and maximize , for fixed values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , our _ hierarchy parameter _ over all the unconstrained parameters that are inaccessible to low - energy experiments .",
    "this will allow us to assess how strong a hierarchy between different yukawa couplings one could possibly realize for any given values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "our hope is that such a phenomenological link between experimentally accessible observables on the one hand and fundamental theory parameters on the other hand may eventually help to shed more light on the underlying dynamics of the seesaw mechanism and , in particular , on the uv origin of its flavor structure .",
    "our analysis ties in with studies of minimal seesaw models that assume exact texture zeros in the neutrino yukawa matrix  @xcite .",
    "such exact zeros may occur in consequence of certain flavor symmetries in the fundamental high - energy theory of flavor . moreover",
    ", they comply with the spirit of occam s razor and , thirdly , they have proven to be a successful phenomenological tool in the quark sector in the past . as shown by weinberg  @xcite ,",
    "imposing texture zeros in the mass matrices for the first two quark generations allows one to derive a successful prediction for the cabibbo angle , @xmath18 .",
    "the main difference between our analysis and the `` texture ansatz '' is that we intend to tackle the flavor problem in the neutrino sector from quite the opposite direction .",
    "the philosophy behind neutrino mass models involving texture zeros is to derive phenomenological predictions from a more or less well motivated choice of yukawa couplings at high energies , which amounts to a classical top - down approach .",
    "we , by contast , remain _ a priori _ agnostic as to the structure of the neutrino yukawa matrix and let the data decide what hierarchies or textures are experimentally preferred or ruled out . in this sense , we are going to pursue a data - driven bottom - up approach . also , as we do not impose any conditions on the neutrino yukawa couplings from the outset , our approach is considerly more model - independent than the conventional theory - driven texture ansatz .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we shall first review the type - i seesaw mechanism featuring two right - handed neutrinos . in sec .",
    "[ sec : hierarchy ] , we will then define our novel hierarchy parameter that will allow us to quantify the quality of different hierarchies in the neutrino yukawa matrix .",
    "subsequently , we will present in sec .  [",
    "sec : scan ] the results of our scan of parameter space , i.e. , the maximal hierarchy parameter in dependence of @xmath1 and @xmath2 . here",
    ", our main conclusion will be that models with two right - handed neutrinos and _ approximate _ two - zero textures can still accommodate both a normal ( nh ) and an inverse ( ih ) neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "this represents an important caveat to the conventional statement that seesaw models with two right - handed neutrinos and two texture zeros do not allow for a normally ordered light - neutrino mass spectrum .",
    "similarly , we will show how , in the case of an inverse neutrino mass hierarchy , the viable set of exact textures can be generalized to a much larger set of approximate textures .",
    "most of our observations are in accord with the naive expectation that relaxing the assumption of an exact flavor texture should enlarge the accessible part of parameter space .",
    "but to us , it seems as if our approach presents the issue of yukawa hierarchies in minimal neutrino mass models from a new angle and , thus , deserves a closer examination . in sec .",
    "[ sec : stability ] , we will briefly discuss the stability of our numerical results under variations in the experimental input data .",
    "as we will see , our findings for @xmath1 and @xmath2 exhibit an absolut uncertainty owing to the experimental errors of at most @xmath19 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we will finally conclude and give a brief outlook as to how our analysis could be extended .",
    "we will comment , in particular , on the possibility of generalizing our analysis to arbitrary textures as well as to the case of three right - handed neutrinos .",
    "let us first recall how the seesaw lagrangian in eq .",
    "results in small majorana masses for the sm neutrinos . in the course of electroweak symmetry breaking , the higgs field @xmath20 acquires a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , @xmath21 .",
    "this turns the yukawa term in eq .   into a dirac mass term for the left - handed and right - handed neutrinos @xmath22 and @xmath7 , @xmath23 provided that @xmath24 , we can integrate out the right - handed neutrinos @xmath7 at low energies , which results in the famous type - i seesaw formula for the sm neutrino masses , @xmath25 here , the sm neutrino mass matrix , @xmath26 , is a complex symmetric @xmath27 matrix , which needs to be diagonalized by a unitary takagi factorization . in matrix notation , this means @xmath28 for a normally ordered light - neutrino mass spectrum , we have @xmath29 , whereas an inversely ordered light - neutrino mass spectrum is characterized by @xmath30 . in the presence of only two right - handed neutrinos , @xmath26 in eq .",
    "is a rank-2 matrix .",
    "the lightest neutrino mass eigenvalue therefore vanishes in our model for both nh and ih , @xmath31 .",
    "we shall work in a basis in which the charged - lepton mass matrix is diagonal .",
    "then we can identify the unitary matrix @xmath32 in eq .   as the lepton mixing or pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) matrix ,",
    "which relates the flavor eigenstates @xmath22 to the mass eigenstates",
    "@xmath33 , @xmath34 in the case of one massless sm neutrino , the pmns matrix encompasses five ( instead of the usual six ) physical degrees of freedom ( dofs ) : three mixing angles , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , which take values in the interval @xmath38 $ ] , as well as two @xmath0-violating phases , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 here , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are a shorthand notation for @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively . in total",
    ", we , thus , arrive at the conclusion that the sm neutrino sector features seven low - energy observables : the five observables encoded in the pmns matrix as well as two nonzero mass eigenvalues .",
    "this needs to be contrasted with the available parameters at high energies .",
    "the neutrino yukawa matrix @xmath15 contains twelve real parameters  six absolute values and six phases  out of which three phases are unphysical as they can be absorbed by charged - lepton rotations .",
    "meanwhile , the right - handed neutrino masses @xmath46 constitute two further high - energy parameters .",
    "changes in these masses can , however , be compensated for by a rescaling of the neutrino yukawa couplings , @xmath47 this leaves us with , in total , @xmath48 independent parameters at high energies , which is sufficient to account for the seven low - energy observables contained in @xmath49 and @xmath32 .",
    "the functional relation between the input parameters at high energies and the observables at low energies becomes most transparent in the casas - ibarra parametrization of the neutrino yukawa matrix  @xcite .",
    "to re - derive this parametrization making use of our conventions and notations , we simply have to combine the seesaw formula in eq .   with the relation in eq .",
    ", @xmath50 solving this matrix equation for the neutrino yukawa matrix , one finds @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a complex @xmath16 rotation matrix that satisfies @xmath53 , but _ not _",
    "@xmath54 , @xmath55 here , the rotation angle @xmath3 is an arbitrary complex number , which represents the two real excess dofs in the high - energy yukawa matrix @xmath15 compared to the low - energy mass matrix @xmath56 .",
    "the parameter @xmath57 distinguishes between a `` positive '' and a `` negative '' branch of possible rotation matrices @xmath52 .",
    "the resulting yukawa matrices on both branches can , however , be mapped onto each other by a combination of sign changes , column exchange , etc . ; see appendix  b of ref .",
    "@xcite for details . for our purposes , we are , thus , free to either pick @xmath58 or @xmath59 . in the following ,",
    "we will work , w.l.o.g .",
    ", with the yukawa matrices on the positive branch , @xmath58 .",
    "the casas - ibarra parametrization also exhibits the re - parametrization freedom displayed in eq .  .",
    "to see this explicitly , it turns out convenient to introduce the following quantities , @xmath60 which allow us to write down a dimensionless version of the casas - ibarra parametrization , @xmath61 the expressions on the right - hand sides of these two equations now no longer depend on the heavy - neutrino masses @xmath46 . instead",
    ", these two masses are absorbed in the rescaled yukawa couplings @xmath62 , which are invariant under the scaling transformation in eq .  .",
    "note also that this version of the casas - ibarra parametrization nicely separates the unknown high - energy input parameters ( on the left - hand side ) from the low - energy observables that can be measured in experiments ( on the right - hand side ) . as evident from eq .",
    ", both sets of quantities are related by a rotation about a complex angle @xmath3 .",
    "this angle is physically meaningful at high energies , but appears as an `` unphysical '' auxiliary parameter at low energies .",
    "an important implication of eq .",
    "is that we can always find values of the complex parameter @xmath3 , such that at least one yukawa coupling vanishes exactly .",
    "in fact , all we have to do is to choose @xmath3 such that @xmath63 equals the ratio of two entries in the rescaled pmns matrix @xmath64 , @xmath65 requiring a one - zero texture in the neutrino yukawa matrix , thus , eliminates the parameter @xmath3 and leaves us with an equal number of input parameters and observables .",
    "such one - zero texture models have been extensively discussed in the literature  @xcite , more recently in particular in the context of _ constrained sequential dominance _",
    "@xcite , see , e.g. , ref  @xcite and references therein .    realizing two zeros in the neutrino yukawa matrix",
    "is already more challenging , as it requires a conspiracy among four entries in the rescaled pmns matrix @xmath64 .",
    "schematically , we have @xmath66 with the exact matrix entries @xmath67 following from eq .  , respectively .",
    "in fact , such scenarios correspond to the most minimal realizations of the seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that , in the case of only two right - handed neutrinos , three or more texture zeros in the neutrino yukawa matrix lead to at least two vanishing neutrino mixing angles . therefore , given the fact that all three mixing angles , including the reactor mixing angle @xmath36 , have been measured to be nonzero in experiments in recent years , models with more than two texture zeros clearly conflict with the data . meanwhile ,",
    "also models with two texture zeros are highly constrained . to illustrate the range of viable two - zero textures ,",
    "let us adopt the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , which categorizes all possible two - zero textures in the matrix @xmath15 into three groups , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 ,    @xmath71    as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , only four out of these 15 textures turn out to be compatible with the current low - energy neutrino data : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75and that even only in the case of an inverse mass hierarchy .",
    "this amounts to the statement that the type - i seesaw model with two right - handed neutrinos and an _ exact _ two - zero texture does not allow for a normally ordered light neutrino mass spectrum .",
    "of course , this conclusion no longer holds true once one gives up on the texture zeros in eq .   and replaces all zeros by nonzero entries .",
    "one of our main goals in this paper will be to quantify this statement and to assess how large these corrections to an exact two - zero texture need to be so that a normal mass hierarchy comes into reach again .",
    "moreover , it is important to note that the pairs of textures @xmath72 and @xmath74 as well as @xmath73 and @xmath75 only differ by an exchange of the two columns in @xmath15 . physically , this simply corresponds to the two neutrinos @xmath76 and @xmath77 interchanging their coupling strengths to the sm lepton - higgs fields .",
    "such a change in the yukawa term in eq .",
    "can , however , always be compensated for by a corresponding change in the @xmath78 majorana masses , @xmath79 .",
    "the textures @xmath80 and @xmath81 are , thus , bound to lead to the same low - energy predictions , respectively .",
    "this is best seen in the predictions for the @xmath0-violating phases @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "owing to the restrictive condition in eq .  , these two observables are completely determined by the neutrino masses and mixings angles . to leading order in the small mixing angle @xmath82 ,",
    "one finds  @xcite @xmath83    .best - fit values and @xmath6 confidence intervals for the five low - energy observations that are currently accessible in experiments ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 ) as well as for the @xmath0-violating phase @xmath1  @xcite .",

    "it is straightforward to extend the philosophy behind our approach to other , more complicated neutrino mass models as well as to arbitrary textures . in the end , one always only has to follow the same three steps .",
    "( i ) express all high - energy yukawa couplings in terms of two sets of parameters : low - energy observables on the one hand and `` unphysical '' parameters that are inaccessible at low energies on the other hand ; ( ii ) define an appropriate ratio of ( sorted ) yukawa couplings that is relevant to a certain texture ; and ( iii ) marginalize this ratio over all unobservable parameters .",
    "this procedure should always results in phenomenological constraints on the yukawa structures of interest in dependence of the available observables at low energies .",
    "of course , the technical complexity of this algorithm grows with the number of inaccessible parameters . from this perspective , our analysis in this paper benefits from the fact that we are only dealing with two auxiliary parameters , @xmath96 and @xmath97 . or put differently : while our method appears to be applicable also in a more general context , we choose to illustrate our approach in the context of a minimal seesaw neutrino mass model because of its sheer simplicity .    a practical obstacle that one encounters when attempting to compute @xmath98 as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 is that the hierarchy parameter @xmath92 is not a smooth function of the complex rotation angle @xmath3 .",
    "whenever the ordering among the sorted yukawa couplings changes in consequence of a variation of @xmath3 , @xmath92 experiences a `` kink '' at which it is longer differentiable .",
    "this observation leads us to forgo any further analytical calculations in the following .",

    "this leads us to conclude that all of our results in sec .",
    "[ sec : scan ] ought to be stable under the variation of the input data within the current experimental limits .",
    "any further quantitative statement beyond this qualitative conclusion would require a more sophisticated analysis , which is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the type - i seesaw mechanism with only two right - handed neutrinos is a minimal neutrino mass model that manages to account for all observed mass squared differences and mixing angles in the sm neutrino sector .",
    "compared to the conventional seesaw scenario involving three right - handed neutrinos , this model comes with a smaller number of parameters that are inaccessible at low energies and is , thus , more predictive .",
    "in addition , it complies with the philosophy of occcam s razor , which calls on us to always only make as few assumptions as necessary .    in the context of this model",
    ", we have addressed the following question is this paper : suppose leptonic @xmath0 violation should be conclusively measured in the near future , what lessons could we possibly learn from such a measurement about the underlying yukawa structure of the sm neutrino sector ?",
    "in particular , we were interested in stuyding to what extent one would still be able to realize ( approximate ) textures zeros in the neutrino yukawa matrix for given values of the @xmath0-violating phases @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in order to answer this question",
    ", we introduced a novel _ hierarchy parameter _ , @xmath92 ( see eq .  ) , in terms of a ratio of ordered yukawa couplings . minimizing this hierarchy parameter over all `` unphysical '' parameters ( i.e. , all parameters that are inaccessible at low energies ) , we were then able to identify the respective maximal yukawa hierarchies for each pair of hypothetical @xmath100 values .",
    "this analysis led us to several interesting results :    * we recovered the exact two - zero textures @xmath80 and @xmath81 that can be realized in the ih case , see figs .",
    "[ fig : h23scan ] and [ fig : ihsep ] . in addition",
    ", we were able to quantify to what an extent the assumption of exact texture zeros would need to be relaxed , if the phases @xmath1 and @xmath2 should eventually be measured at values slightly off the expected values in these two scenarios , see fig .",
    "[ fig : zoom ] . * we found that , allowing for perturbations of @xmath102 , approximate two - zero textures",
    "may also be realized in the nh case ; e.g. , an approximate @xmath103 texture at @xmath125 or at @xmath126 , see figs .",
    "[ fig : h23scan ] and [ fig : nhsep ] .",
    "this conclusion represents an important caveat to the conventional wisdom that the type - i seesaw mechanism involving only two right - handed neutrinos actually does not allow for two - zero textures in the nh case .",
    "* we observed that the minimized hierarchy parameter @xmath98 ( see eq .  ) tends to take particularly small values at @xmath100 values that conserve @xmath0 .",
    "our list of approximate two - zero textures in tab .",
    "[ tab : results ] , therefore , splits into @xmath0-preserving as well as @xmath0-violating scenarios .",
    "* we studied the interplay of `` flavor - aligned '' and `` flavor - nonaligned '' yukawa matrices , see figs .",
    "[ fig : nhsep ] and [ fig : ihsep ] , arriving at the conclusion that the possibility of flavor alignment should not be neglected when searching for the _ global _ minima of the hierarchy parameter @xmath92 . *",
    "finally , we checked the stability of our numerical results under variations of the experimental input data .",
    "we found that the experimental uncertainties in the low - energy observables shift our predictions for @xmath1 and @xmath2 at the level of @xmath19 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : expuncert ] .",
    "this is safely negligible .    in summary",
    ", we emphasize that we performed a data - driven bottom - up analysis . instead of starting from the high - energy perspective ( i.e. , choosing a particular neutrino mass model and calculating the corresponding predictions for the low - energy observables )",
    ", we based our analysis on the question as to what might be seen in neutrino experiments in the near future .",
    "we think that this is an interesting approach , which promises to be useful also in the context of other models and with regard to other types of yukawa structures . in the usual seesaw model with three right - handed neutrinos , one might , e.g. , introduce a hierarchy parameter @xmath127 as a measure for the gap between the @xmath128 and the @xmath129 entry in the list of ordered yukawa couplings @xmath130 ( see also eq .  ) . minimizing this parameter over the three complex phases in the casas - ibarra parametrization of the three - neutrino yukawa matrix , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 , @xmath134",
    "would then allow to study arbitrary textures in a very general context .",
    "of course , the technical complexity of such an analysis would increase with the number of undetermined parameters .",
    "but we believe that , in principle , our method should be applicable in a broad class of models and for a large variety of yukawa structures . in the end , extending our analysis to other neutrino mass models would serve as an important preparation for the anticipated data on @xmath0 violation in the lepton sector  providing us with a better understanding of which @xmath0 phases would be compatible with which yukawa structures in the sm neutrino sector .",

    "<S> the type - i seesaw mechanism involving only two right - handed neutrinos represents a minimal model to account for the observed masses and mixings in the standard model neutrino sector . </S>",
    "<S> this model features four real parameters that can not be fully fixed by the current data : two @xmath0-violating phases , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , as well as one complex parameter , @xmath3 , that is experimentally inaccessible at low energies . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a systematic scan of this model over the complex @xmath3 plane , addressing the following question : suppose @xmath1 and @xmath2 should be measured at particular values in the future  what are then the conceivable maximal hierarchies in the neutrino yukawa matrix that are still consistent with all observations ? in this sense , our analysis generalizes previous studies of the type - i seesaw mechanism with two right - handed neutrinos that assume exact texture zeros in the neutrino yukawa matrix . as we are able to demonstrate , relaxing the assumption of exact texture zeros , significantly enlarges the range of possible yukawa matrices . for instance , allowing for corrections of up to @xmath4 , it turns out that models with an approximate two - zero texture can be realized even in the case of a normally ordered light - neutrino mass spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> this represents an important caveat to the conventional wisdom that two - zero textures and a normal mass hierarchy are actually inconsistent with each other in seesaw models with only two right - handed neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , we show that , also in the case of an inverted hierarchy , small perturbations can resurrect yukawa textures that are conventionally believed to be ruled out by the data . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is based on a novel _ hierarchy parameter _ that allows us to assess to what extent any given yukawa matrix exhibits a certain ( approximate ) flavor texture . </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to generalize our hierarchy parameter to arbitrary textures and a larger number of right - handed neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> this paves the way for similar studies in other neutrino mass models .    </S>",
