    "recent results from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , large scale structure ( lss ) and type ia supernovae observations have yielded a standard model of cosmology : a flat universe consisting of more than 70% dark energy and about 23% dark matter with the remainder ordinary ( baryonic ) matter @xcite .",
    "the widely discussed ( nonbaryonic ) dark matter candidate is weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) .",
    "the newest and lightest particle , the neutralino ( predicted by supersymmetry ( susy ) ) , would be an ideal wimp candidate @xcite .",
    "wimp dark matter can elastically scatter off the target nuclei of a terrestrial detector , transferring energy to the nuclei .",
    "dark matter can be observed by detecting this released interaction energy .",
    "but the main challenge is to identify a wimp recoil event over many background events .",
    "recent best limits on an upper bound for the cross section of wimp spin independent interactions are given by the cdmsii @xcite , xenon10 @xcite and zeplin - iii @xcite experiments .",
    "to increase the sensitivity , a detector with larger mass and low background is required .",
    "xmass was originally proposed as a 10-ton multi - purpose single phase liquid xenon detector aiming to detect pp - solar neutrinos , dark matter , and double beta decay @xcite . for a large scale experiment ,",
    "single phase detectors are attractive due to their simple detector configuration and scalability .",
    "we have adopted a step by step approach and will initially develop an 800kg - sized detector ( @xmath0100 kg fiducial mass ) dedicated to a dark matter search .",
    "liquid xenon has a large light yield comparable to that of nai(tl ) therefore allowing us to set a low energy threshold and achieve good acceptance for dark matter . because of liquid xenon s large atomic number ( z = 54 ) and high density ( @xmath0 3 g/@xmath1 ) , background @xmath2-rays are quickly attenuated near the outer edge of the liquid xenon volume which makes a low background volume around the center of the detector .",
    "this self - shielding of the environmental @xmath3-ray background is the key concept of the detector .    in this paper , we describe the results from a prototype detector by which we have measured basic properties of a single phase liquid xenon detector .",
    "we have established vertex and energy reconstruction methods and demonstrated the self - shielding power for background reduction .",
    "the wimps signal can be identified over many background events . for nuclear recoil events , the largest background contribution originates from neutrons .",
    "kamioka underground laboratory ( the site for xmass ) is at a depth of 2700 m.w.e .",
    "( meters water equivalent ) , and has a smaller neutron flux than a surface laboratory by more than two orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the muon flux is also reduced by about five orders of magnitude @xcite making the cosmogenic activation of xenon negligible . during the future operation of the 800 kg detector",
    ", environmental neutrons and gamma - rays will be reduced to negligible levels by a water shield of more than 2 m thickness .",
    "however , backgrounds from pmts and other materials used for the detector and supporting structures will not be reduced by such means mentioned above .",
    "self - shielding is the most effective suppressor for those backgrounds .",
    "the physical properties of liquid xenon are summarized in table [ tab : physical_properties_lxe ] .",
    "0.3 cm    .physical properties of liquid xenon [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the self - shielding power of liquid xenon was evaluated with @xmath2-ray data , @xmath4cs ( 662 kev ) and @xmath5co ( 1173 and 1333 kev ) from collimator a. if a @xmath2-ray vertex is near a pmt , it is difficult to accurately reconstruct the vertex because the adc of the pmt saturates at 200 photoelectrons .",
    "therefore these adc saturated events were removed .",
    "the reconstructed vertices along the @xmath2-ray incident direction ( reconstructed @xmath6 ) was checked for events where the reconstructed vertices were within 10 cm from the center on the @xmath7 plane as shown in figure [ fig : self_shielding_cs_co_hole_a ] .",
    "both ends of the distributions are distorted by cutting adc saturated events .",
    "the number of events decreases as a function of the distance from the injected position of the @xmath2-rays which is expected from self - shielding .",
    "662 kev @xmath2-rays from @xmath4cs are attenuated by a factor of about 50 over a distance of 20 cm . while 1173 and 1333 kev @xmath2-rays from @xmath5co are attenuated by a factor of about 3 over a distance of 10 cm .",
    "the distributions of real data agree well with that of the detector simulation .",
    "a prototype single phase liquid xenon detector was developed .",
    "we have tested the performance of a single phase liquid xenon detector , have measured the physical properties of liquid xenon , and have tested the vertex and energy reconstruction methods . by introducing a let dependence in the scintillation yield , the simulation successfully reproduces the non - linear scintillation yield ( @xmath8 10 % ) and the energy resolution of real data between 164 kev and 2615 kev .",
    "we have demonstrated that the self - shielding of liquid xenon for background @xmath2-rays is quite effective .",
    "the 800 kg single phase liquid xenon detector is optimized for a dark matter search .",
    "the photo coverage is @xmath0 70 % and the expected photoelectron yield is @xmath0 5 p.e./kevee for an event at the detector center .",
    "this large photoelectron yield enables us to set the energy threshold to 5 kevee . with a fiducial volume cut using the reconstructed vertex ,",
    "an ultra low background level as low as @xmath9 can be achieved in the center 40 cm diameter fiducial volume .",
    "the expected sensitivity of the detector for dark matter is about 2 orders magnitude better than the present known limit @xcite assuming 5 years of data with 100 kg fiducial volume .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge the cooperation of kamioka mining and smelting company . this work was supported by grant - in - aid for scientific research on priority areas .",
