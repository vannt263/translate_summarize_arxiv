    "magnetotransport properties of two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) at semiconductor interfaces , subjected to one - dimensional lateral superlattices defined by periodic electrostatic or magnetostatic fields , have attracted increasing interest during the last decade .",
    "properties like the commensurability ( weiss ) oscillations of the magnetoresistance @xcite or the low - field positive magnetoresistance @xcite are well understood and have been qualitatively explained both by quantum - mechanical @xcite and by classical transport calculations .",
    "@xcite these interesting effects occur at low temperatures ( about 4  k or below ) , where the transport properties are governed by random - impurity scattering .",
    "it is well known that in the high - mobility 2degs at semiconductor interfaces the basic scattering mechanism is due to long - range coulomb impurities , which lead predominantly to small - angle scattering of the electrons . in all the mentioned papers this aspect has , however ,",
    "been neglected and the electron - impurity scattering has been treated within simplified , phenomenological models , related to a simple relaxation - time approximation .",
    "such models are suitable only for short - range ( delta - potential ) impurities , which lead to isotropic scattering , in contrast to the anisotropic scattering implied by realistic impurities .",
    "only the most recent calculations , based on classical mechanics and boltzmann equation , have proven that an adequate treatment of scattering anisotropy is important for an understanding of the experimental data .",
    "for instance , the number and the amplitude of the resolved weiss oscillations of the resistivity component @xmath0 , measured when the current flows _",
    "perpendicular _ to the superlattice ( i.e. , perpendicular to the direction of translational invariance ) , can be fitted only if a strongly anisotropic scattering is assumed.@xcite although in the regime of weiss oscillations the magnetic fields are apparently weak enough to allow for classical calculations , quantum effects determined by the landau quantization also play a role in this regime .",
    "the ( weaker ) oscillations of the resistivity component @xmath1 , which are observed when the current flows _",
    "parallel _ to the superlattice and have a phase opposite to those of @xmath0 , have been explained by the quantum oscillations in the density of states ( dos ) .",
    "@xcite for stronger magnetic fields , the presence of well defined landau bands has been clearly identified also in the perpendicular resistance.@xcite more recently , periodic magnetic fields with extremely strong gradients , of amplitudes up to 0.4  t and periods of 500  nm , have been obtained , and huge magnetoresistance oscillations have been detected,@xcite presumably of a quantum origin .",
    "experiments on another class of unidirectional ( electrostatic ) superlattices , of short - periods , have shown an anisotropy of the magnetoresistivity tensor which could be explained , within a semi - classical theory , by different transport times in the directions perpendicular and parallel to the superlattice , and ascribed to the anisotropic character of the scattering events .",
    "@xcite    previous quantum - mechanical calculations for modulated systems have treated the electron - impurity self - energy as a simple c - number.@xcite strictly speaking , this is correct only for delta impurities in the unmodulated system , whereas for modulated systems even in the simple self - consistent born approximation and for delta impurities a complicated self - energy operator results , which does neither commute with the hamiltonian of the impurity - free modulated system , nor with the green function operator of the impurity averaged system .",
    "the assumption of a c - number self - energy may be sufficient to explain certain aspects of the influence of a periodic modulation on the magnetoresistivities qualitatively , especially for a weak modulation . for a strong modulation",
    "however , it can not be justified and will lead to incorrect results . moreover , to include the effect of strongly anisotropic impurity scattering , which turned out to be important in the classical calculations , we have to consider long - range impurity potentials , which lead to important current vertex corrections and are not compatible with a c - number approximation for the self - energy .    in this paper",
    "we take the mentioned experimental information as a motivation to perform a quantum - mechanical transport calculation with a more elaborated treatment of the electron - impurity scattering , including the scattering anisotropy .",
    "we shall consider only modulations of the 2deg varying along one lateral direction , partly because this is a situation of considerable experimental relevance , but also since we expect in this situation especially strong anisotropy effects resulting from the interplay of anisotropic periodic modulation and anisotropic impurity scattering .",
    "we use the kubo formalism , and we calculate the electron - impurity self - energy in the self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) , on the same footing with the vertex function , with a numerical scheme based on fourier expansions . for technical reasons",
    "we describe the finite - range impurities by gaussian potentials . after recalling the simplest and most important classical results ( sec .",
    "ii and appendix b ) , we describe our calculations ( sec .",
    "iii and appendix a ) , and then we discuss examples with electric and magnetic modulations ( sec .",
    "finally we close with some general conclusions ( sec .",
    "we sketch briefly the simplest results concerning the effect of the scattering anisotropy in transport . for the homogeneous , unmodulated system ,",
    "the best known expressions for the conductivities of the 2deg in a magnetic field are the classical drude formulas , @xmath2 @xmath3 being the zero - field conductivity , and @xmath4 the cyclotron frequency in the externally applied perpendicular magnetic field @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 is the electron density , @xmath7 is the relaxation time , and @xmath8 is the conduction - band effective mass . for @xmath9",
    "the diagonal conductivities are proportional to the scattering rate , @xmath10 , resulting from transitions of electrons between closed cyclotron orbits , mediated by electron - impurity scattering .",
    "those contributions to the conductivity will be called scattering contributions in the following . in the presence of a ( weak ) modulation in @xmath11 direction ,",
    "the guiding centers of the cyclotron orbits perform a drift motion in @xmath12 direction .",
    "this drift leads to an additional contribution to @xmath13 , which in the simplest approximation @xcite can be written as average of the square of the drift velocities taken over all drifting orbits at the fermi energy @xmath14 , @xmath15 being due to open orbits with a finite velocity , the modulation induced contribution @xmath16 is , similar to @xmath17 , proportional to the scattering time @xmath7 itself and not to its inverse as @xmath18 .",
    "these different @xmath7 dependences lead us to expect peculiar anisotropies of the conductivity tensor in the presence of anisotropic impurity scattering .    for isotropic electron - impurity scattering , the relaxation time in eq .",
    "( [ drude ] ) is the average flight time of an electron between two scattering events , @xmath19 . for anisotropic scattering",
    "this has to be replaced by the transport or momentum relaxation time , @xmath20 , which is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the scattering amplitude for elastic scattering at the fermi edge from an initial state @xmath23 to a final state @xmath24 , which depends only on @xmath25 and the angle @xmath26 between @xmath24 and @xmath23 . for isotropic scattering , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "in general , however , @xmath29 , and this ratio increases with increasing predominance of small - angle scattering .",
    "this means that with increasing importance of forward scattering , and for @xmath30 , the conductivity component @xmath18 and the scattering contribution to @xmath13 should become smaller,@xcite whereas @xmath31 is expected to become larger , similar to @xmath17 .",
    "corresponding anisotropies are expected for the resistivity tensor @xmath32 for the homogeneous system , the classical drude resistivity tensor has diagonal components which are independent of the magnetic field , @xmath33 , and thus always _ decrease _ with increasing importance of forward scattering .",
    "a simple argument for this result is that the dominant contribution to the electrical resistance comes from the electron backscattering while the forward scattering gives no contribution .",
    "obviously , for finite - range impurities the scattering anisotropy favorizes the forward - scattering events . for a system with periodic modulation in @xmath11 direction , the classical calculations",
    "@xcite yield a modulation - induced contribution @xmath34 which , in contrast to @xmath35 , _ increases _ with increasing forward scattering",
    ".    it has also been emphasized in refs .",
    "@xcite that , even for isotropic scattering , the backscattering term in boltzmann s equation does not vanish as in homogeneous systems , but rather is important to guarantee particle conservation , i.e. , the equation of continuity .",
    "this backscattering term , which is the classical analog of the vertex corrections in the quantum treatment , is necessary to obtain the correct ( quasi - local ) @xmath5 dependence of the modulation - induced resistance correction for large magnetic fields , which is @xmath36 for electric and @xmath37 for pure magnetic modulation .",

    "this ansatz is sufficient to ensure the vanishing of the vertex corrections , but , on the other hand , it captures essential effects of the collisions and of the density of states.@xcite moreover , it is regarded as satisfactory if one is interested mainly in the influence of the system geometry and not of impurity scattering on the transport properties . in the cna",

    "all these results for the cna are in agreement with the corresponding classical results summarized in sec .",

    "the aim of the present paper is to go beyond the cna .",
    "indeed , there exists no justification of the cna within the formalism of the scba . even if we _",
    "assume _ that the green operator ( [ greenf ] ) is diagonal , say in the modulated basis , and insert that into eq .",
    "( [ scba ] ) , the evaluation of the kernel ( see appendix",
    "a ) yields a non - diagonal self - energy , and thus in the next iteration step a non - diagonal green operator .",
    "one finds , that there exists no basis in which the hamiltonian of the modulated system ( without disorder ) , the impurity - averaged green function , and the self - energy operator are simultaneously diagonal , since these three operators do all not commute with each other . for obtaining numerical solutions of the self - consistent equations ( [ greenf])-([scba ] ) and ( [ vertexf])-([vertexc ] )",
    "we find it convenient to express the matrix elements of all the operators in the landau basis , since the kernels describing the impurity - averaging in the scba are independent of the modulation in this case .",
    "then , for a given modulation model and for fixed values of energy @xmath105 and average magnetic field @xmath5 , the matrix elements of the green operator @xmath106 depend on two discrete ( landau ) quantum numbers and a quasi - continuous one ( center coordinate ) .",
    "equation  ( [ scba ] ) provides a linear relation between these and the self - energy matrix elements , which have the same structure , mediated by the scba kernel , which depends on four discrete indices and a single continuous one , since the @xmath53 relation is of a convolution type ( see appendix a ) .",
    "thus , it is convenient to expand the @xmath53 dependence into a fourier series .",
    "moreover , we restrict our consideration to modulation models of defined parity , which allows to reduce the number of fourier coefficients by a factor of two .",
    "( [ greenf])-([scba ] ) provide a non - linear integral equation for @xmath107 or , equivalently , @xmath108 . at finite temperature , the solutions are needed in a finite interval around the chemical potential , which has to be calculated for given average electron density .",
    "having calculated these solutions , we can solve the linear integral equations ( [ vertexf])-([vertexc ] ) for the vertex functions , which have a similar matrix structure as the green operator and are needed to calculate the conductivity components .",
    "it is evident that the requirements on storage capacity and computational time increase rapidly with the number of landau levels and of fourier coefficients , which have to be taken into account . due to the limited computer facilities , we will therefore have to use somewhat unrealistic model assumptions , which allow to restrict , e.g. , the number of necessary fourier coefficients .",
    "we will also restrict the investigation of scattering - anisotropy effects to the consideration of only two values of the impurity range @xmath83 .",
    "the results of the cna can be found by taking @xmath86 and , simultaneously , reducing all the fourier series to the first term with @xmath109 ( which is the average value , see appendix a ) .",
    "note , that the latter prescription is an additional approximation which has no justification , but allows the comparison of the correct results with those of the cna .",
    "we shall consider the effects of the anisotropic collisions on the scattering and band contributions to the diagonal components of the _",
    "conductivity tensor_. in order to illustrate the results for the _ resistivity tensor _ , eq .",
    "( [ rhotensor ] ) , we shall simplify the hall conductivity by completely neglecting the impurity effects on it . of course , quantum hall plateaus are thus ignored , although they are seen in the experiments on modulated systems for larger magnetic fields . however , we assume that the structure of the longitudinal resistivities is mostly determined by the periodic landau bands for sufficiently low magnetic fields , and not by localization effects which are beyond the scba .",
    "especially the anisotropy effects corresponding to the band conductivity are expected to result from the diagonal components of the conductivity tensor ( a corresponding diagonal contribution in the modulated basis does not exist for the hall conductivity ) . with these assumptions ,",
    "the hall conductivity is given by @xmath110",
    "for computational reasons we have chosen our modulation parameters such that we can obtain convergent results by truncating the landau basis to the first 10 - 30 wave functions , and the fourier series with respect to @xmath53 to the first 10 - 20 terms .",
    "we avoid the necessity of including higher fourier coefficients by keeping a relatively weak modulation amplitude , and also by choosing @xmath83 shorter , but comparable to @xmath111 . for a disorder broadening much smaller than the typical bandwidth , the periodic matrix elements @xmath112 and @xmath113 as functions of @xmath53 exhibit large pole - like structures ( which become poles for @xmath114 ) , if @xmath105 falls into the spectrum @xmath115 of the landau bands @xmath116 or @xmath117 .",
    "apparently this structure requires the inclusion of many fourier coefficients .",
    "but , due to the gaussian factors of the landau wave functions , the matrix elements of the collision operator @xmath118 decay like gaussians with increasing @xmath119 , eq .",

    "( [ integd0 ] ) and ( [ efn ] ) . for @xmath87",
    "the fourier coefficients are calculated by integrating the periodic functions , and in order to keep a reasonable number of points in the integrals we restricted ourselves - nevertheless - to a relatively large disorder broadening , i.e. , @xmath95 smaller , but comparable to the width of the landau bands .",
    "therefore , we do not attempt to give necessarily realistic results , but rather to identify and to understand the effects of the anisotropic scattering qualitatively .",

    "( vhs s ) are resolved in all cases .",
    "the small maximum at @xmath141 t is an artifact due to the elliptic shape of the dos , typical for the scba : unlike in the cna , in the other calculations the self - energy depends on the center coordinate , and since the disorder broadening is comparable to the bandwidth , the two high - dos peaks due to the band edges may partially overlap , yielding extra maxima in between . such details are , however , not important for the conductivities",
    ".    results for the conductivities are shown in fig .  3 , again in the cna , and also with a matrix self - energy ( including the vertex corrections ) , for two choices of @xmath83 .",
    "note , that the landau bands do not overlap in the present case .",
    "thus , in the cna the scattering and band conductivities are given by the estimates eqs .",
    "( [ siscatt ] ) and ( [ siband2 ] ) in appendix b. numerically , we obtain @xmath142 in the cna , which tells that , _ in this approximation _ and for the chosen values of modulation amplitude and ( relatively large ) disorder broadening , the band conductivity is very small .",
    "the first flat - band condition ( see appendix b ) at @xmath14 is obtained for @xmath143 t , where the scattering conductivities have maxima .",
    "when the vertex corrections are included , even for @xmath86 , the situation completely changes : with increasing magnetic field the two conductivities have opposite evolutions .",
    "the pure scattering conductivity @xmath18 is drastically reduced , and the band conductivity leads to a dramatic increase of @xmath13 . while the double - peak structure of the dos is no longer resolved in @xmath18 , it may survive in @xmath13 .",
    "we can interpret these results in physical terms , taking into account that the anisotropy of the modulation results in anisotropic electron states : unbound propagation in the @xmath12 direction and confined cyclotronic motion in the @xmath11 direction within the cyclotron diameter @xmath144 .",
    "for low magnetic fields such that @xmath145 the effect of the modulation on the scattering events is averaged out and the scattering remains isotropic for @xmath86 .",
    "this changes for @xmath146 , when the electrons propagate along relatively narrow channels in the @xmath12 direction .",
    "the _ decrease _ of @xmath18 , with respect to the cna , can be understood just like the effect of the scattering anisotropy on the longitudinal ( scattering ) conductivities in the absence of the modulation , but in the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "@xcite at the same time , the _ increase _ of the band conductivity contributing to @xmath13 can be understood in analogy to the effect of the scattering anisotropy on the conductivity of quasi - free electrons , with no modulation and no magnetic field .",
    "a landau band has the strongest dispersion in its center and an uncertainty in energy due to disorder broadening translates into a much smaller range @xmath147 of available final states after scattering as compared to the band edges .",
    "this in turn leads to a stronger increase in forward scattering and , thus , to the enhanced band conductivity in the middle of a band . obviously , this effect is stronger for finite - range impurities than for @xmath86 .",
    "the decomposition of @xmath13 into scattering and band contributions is however complicated by the vertex corrections , which in fact with increasing modulation amplitude mix them increasingly together .",
    "therefore the behavior of the scattering contribution to @xmath13 can not be very clearly identified and understood with these simple interpretations .",
    "we found numerically that , for the results shown in figs .  3 and 4 , the vertex corrections corresponding to @xmath148 $ ] and @xmath149 $ ] are negligible .",
    "for delta impurities one can show analytically that they vanish exactly for @xmath150 ( see appendix a ) . in general , their small values",
    "can be explained with the help of the ward identities , which relate @xmath151 $ ] to the commutators of the self - energy with the position operators.@xcite the matrix elements of the vertex corrections become determined by differences between off - diagonal matrix elements of the self - energy , which are small unless the landau - level mixing is very strong .",

    "in general , for both electric and magnetic modulations , the positive magnetoresistance and the weiss oscillations have been successfully explained by the classical transport calculations , where the classical analog of the band conductivity is in fact calculated .",
    "@xcite in the intermediate regime mentioned here , the quantum effects become important .",
    "the modulated magnetic field is strong and generates landau bands that partially overlap , yielding oscillations of the dos at the fermi level .",
    "we ascribe the huge oscillations observed in the experiment to the resulting oscillations of the band conductivity .    in our calculations",
    "we take @xmath125 nm and @xmath158 t for the modulation , and @xmath159 mev t@xmath134 for the scattering - energy parameter . in fig .",
    "5 we show the calculated resistivities with @xmath5 starting at the end of the positive - magnetoresistance regime .",
    "the vertex corrections are included , both for zero and finite impurity range .",
    "the contribution of the scattering conductivity is negligible in @xmath13 , and thus in @xmath153 [ see eq .",
    "( [ rhotensor ] ) ] , because the landau bands are much wider than the disorder broadening @xmath95 .",
    "the filling factor varies between 21 and 11.4 , and the number of landau bands intersected by the fermi level , for a fixed @xmath5 , varies between four and two .    in fig .",
    "6(a ) we have selected three energy spectra with a vhs at the fermi level , corresponding to a landau band edge .",
    "the singularities are well resolved in @xmath96 , fig .",
    "the profile of @xmath96 is very well reproduced in both resistivities calculated at zero temperature , fig .",
    "@xmath153 has minima and @xmath154 has maxima where @xmath96 has maxima .",
    "this clearly tells that @xmath153 is determined by the band conductivity and @xmath154 by the scattering conductivity . for a finite temperature , like 1 k ,",
    "the vhs are smeared and the resistivities oscillate according to the number of the landau bands at the fermi level .",
    "for instance , for 0.442 t @xmath160 0.473 t _ three _ landau bands are intersected by the fermi level , while for 0.473 t @xmath160 0.504 t _ four _ bands , fig .",
    "6(a ) , such that @xmath153 has a maximum in the first interval ( low @xmath96 ) and a minimum in the second one ( high @xmath96 ) , while @xmath154 has the opposite evolution .",
    "just like in the case of the electric modulation , the effect of the scattering anisotropy and of the vertex corrections is to increase the band conductivity and to decrease the scattering contributions . here ,",
    "such effects are not so important for @xmath86 , due to the relatively low average magnetic field .",
    "therefore the dos - induced oscillations of the resistivities can be qualitatively explained even in the cna ( not shown in fig .  5 ;",
    "compare the estimate for the band conductivity in the case of overlapping bands , eq .",
    "( [ overlap ] ) in appendix b ) , and the oscillations can be amplified by reducing the disorder parameter @xmath161 .",
    "of course , quantitative agreement with the experiment can not be expected in our calculations , where the disorder parameters are chosen according to computational possibilities rather than to experimental requirements .",
    "the model of gaussian impurities involves two parameters , @xmath83 and @xmath162 . for a direct comparison between the theoretical and the experimental results , for different choices of @xmath83 one should also adjust @xmath161 ,",
    "e.g.  by imposing a fixed zero - magnetic - field resistance .",
    "this is given by the transport time @xmath163 , eq .",
    "( [ tautrans ] ) , which can be calculated analytically for our gaussian impurity model.to keep @xmath163 fixed , we should compare the results for @xmath164 nm and @xmath159 mev t@xmath134 with those for @xmath86 and @xmath165 mev t@xmath134 .",
    "of course , the realistic scatterers have a long range , with coulomb tails determined by the spacer width , and may be not too well approximated by gaussians .",
    "experimental results in this regime exist only on the resistivity component @xmath166 , not on @xmath154 , to our knowledge .",
    "we predict that , as indicated by our calculations , @xmath154 should be at least one order of magnitude smaller than @xmath153 and should oscillate in a similar manner , but with minima and maxima interchanged .",
    "unlike the weiss oscillations , which are determined by the geometric commensurability of the cyclotron diameter with the modulation period , @xcite these novel modulation - induced oscillations occur for fermi energies below the lowest commensurability ( flat - band ) condition , and are essentially a dos effect .",
    "measurements of the magnetoresistance in both @xmath11 and @xmath12 directions , in the quantum regime , have been recently performed on magnetically modulated 2degs in inas heterostructures .",
    "@xcite the electron density is typically one order of magnitude higher than in gaas systems , and thus the filling factors are much larger .",
    "the sdh peaks observed in @xmath153 are about 20 times higher than in @xmath154 . at the same time , with decreasing the uniform field @xmath5 , the sdh minima at even filling factors are replaced by resistivity maxima , while the minima shift to odd filling factors .",
    "it has been convincingly demonstrated , that these minima are not due to spin splitting , which in fact is not resolved in this case .",
    "a similar even - odd shift has been observed in electrically modulated systems , and explained by the behavior of the scattering conductivity when two landau bands partially overlap .",
    "the overlapping vhs of adjacent landau bands yield maxima instead of sdh minima , while minima occur for @xmath14 in the middle of a band ( lower dos ) .",
    "@xcite we therefore believe that , similarly , also in the experiment of heisenberg et.al .",
    ", @xcite only the scattering conductivities are observed , and thus the big difference between @xmath153 and @xmath154 is not due to the band conductivity , but due to an anisotropy of the scattering contributions to @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "we use the parameters of inas , @xmath167 , an electron density such that @xmath168 t , and spin degeneracy . for the magnetic modulation",
    "we take @xmath169 nm and @xmath170 t .",
    "we calculate the resistivities in the regime of the sdh oscillations for impurity parameters suitable to obtain dominant contributions from the scattering conductivities : @xmath171 nm and two values for the disorder broadening , @xmath172 mev t@xmath134 and @xmath173 mev t@xmath134 .",
    "the resistivities are shown in fig .",
    "7 . at @xmath174k ,",
    "the thermal energy @xmath175 is much smaller than the width of the landau bands .",
    "a reference energy spectrum is displayed in fig .",
    "8 . in the explored interval of @xmath5 values ,",
    "the cyclotron diameter of the states at the fermi level varies between @xmath176 and @xmath177 , such that the vertex corrections are very strong .",
    "the contribution of the band conductivity is seen as a central maximum in each of the first three sdh peaks of @xmath153 , located in @xmath178t@xmath179 t . with increasing @xmath5",
    "these central structures disappear , apparently because the effective disorder broadening @xmath95 increases . indeed , by increasing the parameter @xmath161 the mentioned central maxima decrease , and at the same time the lateral shoulders of @xmath153 , as well as @xmath154 , increase .",
    "this behavior clearly shows that the scattering conductivity is dominant here .",
    "the anisotropy of the scattering conductivities , i.e.  @xmath180 , or @xmath181 , is an effect _ qualitatively _ determined by the vertex corrections , and not by the band conductivity .",
    "we have already mentioned such an effect in the discussion of figs .  3 and 4 , where it was less pronounced and combined with the presence of a higher band conductivity , but visible even for delta impurities .",
    "this type of anisotropy , of the scattering conductivities , can not be obtained in the cna . in that approximation again @xmath142 ( or @xmath182 ) , and unlike in the example of the electric modulation , the cna resistivities become here several times bigger than those plotted in fig .  7 .",
    "our results for the magnetic modulation thus show characteristic similarities with the experimental results of heisenberg et .",
    "we are not able to offer a simple argument that could explain the strong anisotropy of the scattering conductivities obtained from the numerical calculations quantitatively .",
    "however , we attribute this anisotropy to both the anisotropic electronic states and the anisotropic impurity scattering . of course , strong anisotropies can be understood qualitatively in the physical picture of quasi - classical orbits with a relaxation of the rigid energy - versus-@xmath53 dispersion due to disorder broadening ( see the discussion in section iv.a of the enhancement of the band conductivity in the middle of a landau band ) .",
    "scattering processes that lead to an effective motion in @xmath12 direction , and thus contribute to @xmath183 , are possible with arbitrarily small changes of the center coordinate @xmath53 , and are favorized if forward scattering predominates . on the other hand ,",
    "elastic scattering processes leading to a substantial effective motion in @xmath11 direction require a finite ( large ) change of the @xmath53 coordinate , i.  e.a scattering by a large angle . such processes , and consequently their contributions to @xmath184 , are suppressed by predominant forward scattering , and for @xmath185 they become even more improbable , since they require a tunneling through an energy barrier .",
    "these aspects have to be better clarified by future analytical calculations .",
    "an analogous set of experimental results has been obtained for an electric modulation of a very short period ( 32 nm ) .",
    "@xcite the resistivity tensor is anisotropic , the resistance in the modulated direction being up to five times bigger than in the uniform direction .",
    "the amplitudes of the shubnikov - de haas peaks are well represented by dingle plots , which are specific to unmodulated ( homogeneous ) systems , where only the scattering conductivity exists .",
    "the results suggest that the band conductivity plays no role in these data , and thus the resistance anisotropy is determined by the scattering anisotropy , as we find in our present calculations .",
    "we have shown with numerical calculations that for strong magnetic fields the anisotropic character of the electron - impurity scattering has both quantitative and qualitative effects on the resistivity tensor of modulated systems .",
    "our magnetotransport calculation is based on a consistent evaluation of the disorder broadening of the single - particle green - functions ( and thereby the density of states ) and of the kubo formulas for the conductivity tensor .",
    "formally , the anisotropy effects enter through vertex corrections , which are calculated from the bethe - salpeter ( integral ) equations .",
    "in contrast to homogeneous systems , for modulated systems these anisotropy effects are important even for short - range ( @xmath88-potential ) impurities , if the average magnetic field is so strong that the cyclotron diameter of the electrons at the fermi level is smaller than the modulation period .",
    "of course , such effects become even much more important for impurities of finite range .",
    "the main results of including the anisotropy effects ( vertex corrections ) are : + ( 1 ) the band conductivity increases , just like the conductivity of a homogeneous 2deg for zero magnetic field ( which is inversely proportional to the disorder - scattering rate ) .",
    "+ ( 2 ) the scattering conductivities decrease , just like the longitudinal conductivities of a homogeneous 2deg in a high magnetic field ( which are proportional to the disorder - scattering rate ) .",
    "+ ( 3 ) the scattering conductivity in the direction of the modulation becomes lower than that in the direction perpendicular to the modulation .",
    "the comparison with the available experimental results suggests that the scattering anisotropy is important not only in the classical regime ( low @xmath5 ) @xcite , but also in the quantum case ( high @xmath5 ) .",
    "this is seen , in both regimes , in the band conductivity , which has a classical origin , but also in the pure quantum scattering conductivity .",
    "experimental results for both @xmath153 and @xmath154 in a unidirectional modulation , for high magnetic fields , are however rarely available,@xcite but still , our results agree qualitatively with these experiments .",
    "the numerical calculations of this work require the solution of the non - linear dyson equation for the green operator , and of the linear bethe - salpeter equation for the vertex operators , each of which depends on two discrete ( landau ) quantum numbers and one quasi - continuous ( @xmath53 ) quantum number , and in addition on the continuous parameters energy @xmath105 and @xmath5 . to make this complex problem tractable with our numerical capabilities , we had to make rather restrictive assumptions for the model parameters .",
    "in particular , we assumed a relatively large impurity broadening to enssure a rapid convergence of the fourier expansions .",
    "therefore , the results shown in this paper are based on a few examples , rather than on a complete insight into the structure of the vertex corrections and a systematic analysis of the length scales imposed by the modulation period , cyclotron radius , and impurity range .",
    "a more detailed , systematic investigation of anisotropic - scattering effects in more realistic cases of high - mobility modulated systems exceeds our present possibilities concerning computer memory and cpu time .",
    "although quantitatively our results depend on the parameters of the gaussian model for impurities , we believe they do not change qualitatively when the impurity range is increased to more realistic values to simulate the situation at high - mobility semiconductor interfaces . of course , in that case the realistic impurity model is the coulomb potential of a charged particle situated outside the 2deg .",
    "nevertheless , for such a model , in order to avoid singularities in the scattering integrals ( [ gammam ] ) or ( [ integd ] ) , one has to include the screening effects of the 2deg on the impurity potential , e.g.   within a thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "note , that the screening of the periodic lateral potential in the case of the electric modulation may considerably reduce the width of the landau bands , and thus the influence of vhs on the magnetoresistivities , which we do not expect for a magnetic modulation .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , the dependence of the screening length on the dos at the fermi level , and also the alternating of quasi - metallic ( compressible ) and insulating ( incompressible ) phases in strong magnetic fields , open the possibility of describing more complicated , but qualitatively new effects in the resistivities .",
    "a.m. has been supported by universitt regensburg , under graduiertenkolleg `` komplexitt in festkrpern '' ( gk176 ) .",
    "useful discussions with david heisenberg , dieter weiss , and bernard etienne are also acknowledged .",
    "in the numerical calculation we find it most convenient to use the landau basis , @xmath186 with @xmath187 the orbital ( oscillator ) quantum number and @xmath188 the ( quasi - continuous ) center coordinate .",
