    "fluid - structure interaction , which models the interaction of movable structures and the surrounding fluid flow , is the key of the design of many engineering problems .",
    "immersed boundary ( ib ) method was first introduced by peskin @xcite for the numerical approximation of blood flow around the heart valves .",
    "the method has been successfully extended to other applications . a detailed discussion on the applications of ib method is given in @xcite .",
    "one key feature of immersed boundary method is that the eulerian mesh in the cartesian coordinate system is fixed , and the configuration of the immersed structure does not necessarily adapt to the eulerian mesh .",
    "this avoids the high cost of mesh updating .",
    "the source term which represents the effects of the force exerted by the immersed structure on the fluid is modelled by a dirac delta function . in the original formulation of immersed boundary method ,",
    "finite difference methods are used in spatial discretization for the governing equations of the fluid flows . since the material points of the immersed boundary may not adapt to the eulerian grid , the dirac delta function needs to be approximated .",
    "the construction of approximations of the dirac delta function is discussed in @xcite .    on the contrary , in finite element and other galerkin methods ,",
    "the dirac delta functions can be handled directly by the variational formulation and therefore approximations of the dirac delta functions are not needed . in @xcite , a finite element approach for immersed boundary method ( fe - ibm ) was proposed .",
    "more recent researches on fe - ibm can be found in @xcite and @xcite .    in this paper , we present a staggered discontinuous galerkin immersed boundary method ( sdg - ibm ) .",
    "ib method is used for modelling the fluid - structure interaction , and the fluid flow is modelled by incompressible navier - stokes equations which would be solved numerically by a discontinuous galerkin method based on staggered meshes .",
    "discontinuous galerkin methods have been applied to problems in fluid dynamics and wave propagations with great success , see for example @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , staggered meshes bring the advantages of reducing numerical dissipation in computational fluid dynamics @xcite , and numerical dispersion in computational wave propagation @xcite . combining the ideas of dg methods and staggered meshes , a new class of staggered discontinuous galerkin ( sdg ) methods for approximations of the incompressible navier - stokes equations",
    "was proposed @xcite .",
    "the new class of sdg methods inherits many good properties , including local and global conservations , optimal convergence , and superconvergence through the use of a local postprocessing technique in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , energy stability is achieved by spectro - consistent discretizations with a novel splitting of the diffusion and the convection term .",
    "an analysis of the sdg method for incompressible navier - stokes equations is given in @xcite .",
    "for a more complete discussion on the sdg method , see also @xcite and the references therein .    in the finite element formulation of ib method in @xcite ,",
    "the convection term was neglected and linearized navier - stokes equations was considered . in our proposed method , by an iterative approach and a skew - symmetric discretization of the convection term , we can also handle the convection term without losing any stability in terms of energy .",
    "another important issue of ib method is that the loss in volume enclosed by the immersed structure in the numerical approximation , which can be resolved by improving the divergence - free property of the interpolated velocity field which drives the lagrangian markers , see @xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "a key component of our method is the use of postprocessing techniques to obtain a pointwise divergence - free velocity field approximation at each time level , which is used to drive the lagrangian markers of the immersed boundary and acts as a convection velocity in the iterative approach of solving the incompressible navier - stokes equations . in particular , by using the pointwise divergence - free postprocessed velocity to drive the lagrangian markers of the immersed boundary , our method significantly resolves the numerical error of lack of volume conservation . in these regards ,",
    "our method has advantages over fe - ibm .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : ibm ] , we will have a brief discussion on the problem formulation of the ib method .",
