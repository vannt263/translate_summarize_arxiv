    "though a large amount of topological charge might be produced through the mechanism of sphaleron transitions , the primary mechanism for topological charge @xmath75 generation at the early stage is by fluctuations of color electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the decay of these fields is essentially governed by the non - abelian dynamics of the glasma  @xcite which ultimately produces the qgp ( close to equilibrium ) .",

    "actual collision profiles , however , are not smooth and the symmetry axis in an individual event is tilted due to fluctuations ( cf . fig .",
    "the geometry fluctuations in the location of the _ participant _ nucleons lead to fluctuations of the participant plane ( pp ) from one event to another , rendering larger coordinate space eccentricities which due to pressure gradients are translated into elliptic flow for the final state particles .",

    "the measured centrality dependence for the same charge pions is flat and practically consistent with zero while that for oppositely charged particles is a monotonic increasing function with impact parameter .",
    "however , the phsd calculations clearly overestimate the experimental points  @xcite .",
    "we note in passing that the phsd results for au+au collisions at the energy @xmath1 200 gev turn out to be astonishingly close to the appropriate experimental data at @xmath1 2.76 tev  @xcite .",
    "this fact indicates that the strength of the repulsive scalar quark potential in phsd might be presently overestimated .    in accordance with eq .",

    "such separation together with phsd calculation results is presented in fig .",
    "[ cmeproj ] for the same charge and opposite charge pions . as was first noted in ref .",
    "@xcite and is seen in fig .",
    "[ cmeproj](a ) , for the same - charge pairs the sinus term is essentially zero whereas the cosine term is finite .",
    "this tells us that the observed correlations are actually in - plane rather than out - of - plane .",
    "this is contrary to the expectation from the chiral magnetic effect , which results in same - charge correlations out of plane .",
    "in addition , since the cosine term is negative , the in - plane correlations are stronger for back - to - back pairs than for small angle pairs .",
    "the phsd does not reproduce these features .",
    "we see also that for opposite - charge pairs the in - plane and out - of - plane correlations are virtually identical . as was stated in  @xcite ,",
    "this is difficult to comprehend since there is a sizable elliptic flow in these collisions .",
    "nevertheless , the phsd model predicts very close in - plane and out - of - plane distributions for opposite - charge pairs due to scalar parton potential and at the same time nicely reproduces the various harmonics of charged particles  @xcite .",
    "this feature is not reproduced in the hsd .",
    "we close this section with some more general remarks . as follows from the results presented in figs .",
    "[ c2hpr],[cmem],[cmeproj ] an additional sizable source of asymmetry is needed for both in - plane and out - of - plane components rather than only an out - of - plane component as expected from the cme . as discussed in the introduction , the vacuum nontrivial topological structure ( as a genuine source of the cme )",
    "leads to the picture of a topological @xmath174 vacuum of non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "the @xmath174 term in the qcd lagrangian explicitly breaks @xmath2 and @xmath3 symmetries of qcd .",
    "however , stringent limits on the value of @xmath175 deduced from the experimental bounds on the electric dipole moment of the neutron  @xcite practically indicate the absence of _ global _ @xmath2 and @xmath3 violation in qcd .",
    "reference to the _ local _ @xmath2- and @xmath3-odd effects due to the topological fluctuations characterized by an effective @xmath176 varying in space and time  @xcite does not provide much hope .",
    "in addition , partons near the phase transition are not chiral ( as typically assumed ) but massive degrees of freedom in the phsd in agreement with lattice qcd calculations .",
    "the finite mass of the partons washes out the chirality effect .",
    "in this study we have investigated several effects that might contribute to the observed chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) in relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions on the basis of event - by - event calculations within the phsd transport approach .",
    "the individual results can be summarized as follows :    * our study shows that fluctuations in the position of quasiparticles can manifest themselves in different interaction stages and in different ways . since the electromagnetic field generated by _",
    "spectators _ is dominant at the early stage , the fluctuation in their position results in a noticeable fluctuation in the strength of the electromagnetic field .",
    "however , the fluctuation spread is not so large as expected in the estimate from ref .",
    "@xcite and its influence on observables is negligible ; in particular , the event plane angle is not tilted due to these electromagnetic field fluctuations ! *",
    "early time fluctuations in the position of _ participant _ baryons were discussed in the past as a source of the impact parameter fluctuation .",
    "its influence survives till the freeze - out resulting in a considerable difference between the theoretical reaction plane and the measured event plane .",
    "this effect leads to an increase in the magnitude of the elliptic flow and generates nonvanishing odd flow harmonics .",
    "* we have found out that within the phsd model the retarded strong electromagnetic field  created during nucleus - nucleus collisions  turns out to be not so important as has been expected before .",
    "similarly to the hsd results in ref .",
    "@xcite , the electromagnetic field has almost no influence on observables .",
    "the reason is not a shortness of the interaction time , when the electromagnetic field is maximal , but the compensation of the mutual action of transverse electric and magnetic components .",
    "this compensation effect might be important , for example , if an additional induced electric field ( as a source of the cme ) is available in the system since this field will not be entangled due to other electromagnetic sources . * another important point emerging from the compensation effect of electric and magnetic forces is worth mentioning : a significance of an external magnetic field in astrophysics is largely accepted .",
    "there are many studies where various effects of external magnetic fields are discussed in the application to astrophysics ( _ e.g. _ , see the introduction in ref .",
    "@xcite and references in @xcite .",
    "it is correct in this particular problems , however , in many cases it is concluded by a statement like `` the same effect should be observed in high - energy heavy - ion collisions '' which does not hold true due the compensation effect as demonstrated in the present work . * in the intermediate stage of the heavy - ion collision the statistical fluctuations of charged quasiparticles in momentum space can generate charge dipoles or even charge quadrupoles .",
    "however , the magnitudes @xmath119 and @xmath132 are small ; their orientation is distributed almost uniformly and the direction of the main axis is changed from event to event .",
    "the influence of the electromagnetic field here is negligible again .",
    "* the transverse momentum conservation  proposed as an alternative mechanism for an explanation of the observed azimuthal asymmetry  shows a correlation of the cme and the elliptic flow .",
    "however , the effect estimated at @xmath1 200 gev is too small and insensitive to the charge separation . * a possible charge separation of balancing charges has been addressed by the charge balance function .",
    "we note that the phsd model fails to describe the focusing effect of the balance function for central au+au collisions .",
    "certainly , further investigations of this problem are needed , both in theory and experiment especially at lower energies .",
    "the phsd approach naturally takes into account the main alternative mechanisms of the cme : the momentum conservation and local charge conservation as well as clusters ( mini jets , strings , prehadrons , resonances ) . at the moderate energies",
    "@xmath1 7.7 and 11.5 gev the phsd model results are close to the experiment since partonic degrees - of - freedom are subleading .",
    "however , at higher collision energy the phsd model fails to reproduce the observed azimuthal asymmetry .",
    "in contrast with our earlier analysis within the hsd model  @xcite , the phsd overestimates the measured centrality dependence of azimuthal distributions due to an increasing action of the repulsive scalar parton potential which generates the collective flow harmonics in accordance with experiment .",
    "this finding suggests that a new source of azimuthal anisotropy fluctuation is needed beyond the ` standard ' interactions incorporated in phsd .",
    "the new source does not dominate in out - of - plane direction as could be expected for the cme but both in - plane and out - of - plane components contribute with a comparable strength . in this respect",
    "the interpretation of the cme star measurements is still puzzling .",
    "the present phsd model is already quite elaborated , however , as our analysis has shown , color degrees of freedom or intimate peculiarities of non - abelian yang - mills theory should additionally be taken into consideration .",
    "in particular , this concerns the very early stage of the nuclear interaction . in this initial state",
    "the highly compressed strongly interacting matter is dense and though the qcd coupling constant is small , gluonic states have high occupation numbers , _",
    "i.e. _ , the partons begin to overlap in phase space which leads to some saturated state .",
    "strong color forces might create strong chromoelectric and chromomagnetic fields producing a new state , a _ glasma _  @xcite as mentioned above in context of the discussion in sec .",
    "[ glasma ] , or forming new objects like `` string ropes '' described in the framework of yang - mills theory  @xcite .",
    "we are planning to include these effects into the phsd model in near future .",
    "another class of strong fields relevant to the chirality and confinement of dynamical quarks is the long range ( or soft ) vacuum gluon field configurations .",
    "long range vacuum gluon fields can be seen as an origin of nonzero gluon condensate and topological susceptibility of qcd vacuum @xcite .",
    "soft fields arise in the consideration of the global minima of the qcd effective action@xcite and are known to play an important role in hadron phenomenology at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "the nonzero gluon condensate survives at high temperature as demonstrated by qcd lattice calculations @xcite .",
    "interplay of strong electromagnetic and vacuum long - range gluon fields can lead to the qualitatively new effects in high energy heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "however these effects are beyond the scope of this paper .",
