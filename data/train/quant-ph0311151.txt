    "the oscillations in the photon number distribution are an interesting feature common to various kind of light states , which may be taken as a signal of non classical behavior of those states .",
    "they were first computed for squeezed states @xcite and interpreted as an interference effect in phase space @xcite .",
    "they also have been the subject of experimental investigations@xcite in connection with the properties of wigner s distribution . since in the actual experimental situation",
    "many factors like the detector properties may modify the conclusions of the theoretical analysis it is of interest to understand better the physics involved and to develop our intuition of how the oscillations may appear and eventually disappear .    for our analysis",
    "we consider a single mode of the electromagnetic field .",
    "for this case , the picture of quantum interference of states in phase space was developed as a generalization of the bohr - sommerfeld description of quantum states as finite areas in phase space @xcite .",
    "the total area of each state is fixed by the normalization requirement @xmath4 .",
    "the area associated with a fock or number state @xmath5 is a circular ring centered at the origin with interior radius @xmath6 and exterior radius @xmath7 .",
    "the areas associated to coherent states and squeezed states are obtained by displacing , or squeezing and displacing the one associated to the vacuum state .",
    "the inner product @xmath8 between two quantum states is then related with the overlapping area of the states in the phase space .",
    "the intersecting region may have in some interesting cases more than one component .",
    "since the probability amplitude @xmath9 is a complex number and the overlapping areas are real , it results natural to associate to each of these components a phase in order to reproduce the quantum mechanical results .",
    "the probability amplitude acquires then the following structure , @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the @xmath13-th component of the overlapping area and their assigned phase respectively .",
    "the presence of the areas @xmath11 in this expression is very natural and physically appealing although the fact that what appears is the square root of the areas does not allow any direct geometrical method to derive eq.([ec1a ] ) . on the other hand the values that have to be chosen for the phases @xmath12 are not evident from the geometry of the pase space",
    ". dowling ( _ et al._)@xcite work out a quite general equivalent of eq .",
    "( [ ec1a ] ) for the probability amplitude of the eigenstates of two different hamiltonian operators using the wkb approximation .",
    "they obtained an explicit expression of the phases where it is possible to recognize a geometrical content .",
    "oscillations in the photon statistics for displaced states , two photon squeezed states and for squeezed number states may also be studied with this methodology but this approach is limited by the validity of the wkb approximation @xcite .",
    "some time after , milburn @xcite show that the interference effects in phase space may also be understood by considering the properties of husimi s function @xmath14 for the state under study .",
    "this author notes that the over - completeness of the coherent states allows to rewrite the probability amplitude @xmath15 as a phase space integral , @xmath16 the functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 could be interpreted as the phase space probability amplitudes for the states @xmath5 and @xmath19 respectively .",
    "each of these functions is proportional to the function @xmath0 of the corresponding state .",
    "@xmath20 @xmath21 one may then approximate the integral in ( [ ec1 ] ) , by restricting the domain of integration to the phase space region where the product of the two probability amplitudes is appreciably different of zero and by identifying the regions were the @xmath22 function concentrates with the phase space regions assigned to the states , this approximation is equivalent to consider the integration domain as the overlapping areas between the different states . following this line of thought in this paper",
    "we discuss in detail the photon number distributions for the displaced number states and the two photon coherent states .",
    "we show that this approach allows to identify the areas and phases for the phase space description without rendering in the wkb approximation .",
    "this results is interesting in particular for the two photon coherent states which has , for high squeezing , the probabilities of even and odd photon numbers oscillating independently .",
    "let us consider first the example of the displaced number states .",
    "they are defined through the action of the displacement operator @xmath23 on the fock states @xmath24 , @xmath25 for simplicity we work with real @xmath26 .",
    "we compute the photon distribution using the method of generating functions .",
    "consider a coherent state @xmath27 with real @xmath28 .",
    "we have , @xmath29 then , @xmath30 with @xmath31 as in other cases the photon number distribution @xmath32 and @xmath33 the phases here are better expressed in terms of the real an imaginary parts of @xmath34 and take the form @xmath35 and @xmath36    in figure([fig1 ] ) we show the phase space probability amplitude module for a number state with @xmath37 .",
    "this function reminds the bohr - sommerfeld ring associated with the corresponding number state except for the fact that here the mean radius is @xmath38 .",
    "this suggests to associate the number state @xmath39 the circular ring centered at origin and located between the radii @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "note also that the phase space amplitude @xmath42 for the displaced number state @xmath43 is obtained by displacing the amplitude @xmath44 .    in figure ( [ fig2 ] )",
    "we show the product @xmath45 for @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "observe that there are two overlapping regions where both terms are appreciably not vanishing .",
    "but note also that the intersection areas with this prescription are not in the same position were they would appear if working with the bohr - sommerfeld bands",
    ". now they may be localized in the intersection points of a circumference of radius @xmath49 centered at origin and a second circumference of radius @xmath50 displaced by @xmath26 , as shown in figure([fig3 ] ) .",
    "the intersection points are then given by @xmath51 and @xmath52 , with @xmath53 and @xmath54        now we approximate the phase space integral of equation ( [ ec1 ] ) for the photon number probability amplitude @xmath55 by taking instead of ( [ malfa ] ) and ( [ alfanbeta ] ) uniform contributions on the intersection of the rings described above with the angles ( [ fim ] ) and ( [ finbeta ] ) evaluated at the points given by ( [ ekis0 ] ) and ( [ lle0 ] ) .",
    "the probability amplitude has then the structure , @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the overlapping areas between the rings corresponding to the number and displaced number states as shown in fig.([fig4 ] ) .     and",
    "the displaced number state @xmath59    the computation of this areas is analogous to the one presented in @xcite for the bohr - sommerfeld strips and is given by , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the internal area between the two circular paths with radii @xmath62 and @xmath63 as shown in figure ( [ fig5 ] ) , with @xmath64 the intersection point of the circumferences , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .    ]",
    "figure ( [ fig6 ] ) show the exact and approximate results of @xmath67 for a displaced state with @xmath47 and @xmath68 showing a good qualitative and quantitative behavior for the values for which the assigned rings actually overlap .    the comparison of the result in eq .",
    "( [ angle1 ] ) which has the direct geometrical interpretation @xmath69 with the one obtained by dowling _",
    "et al _ using the wkb approach is shown in figure ( [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "the wkb phase is given by @xcite @xmath70   + \\left ( n+1/2\\right ) \\arcsin \\left [ \\frac{x_c(m , n)-\\sqrt{2}\\beta}{\\sqrt{2n+1}}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\beta}{2}\\sqrt{2m+1-x_c(m , n)^2}-\\frac{(n - m)\\pi}{2 } + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 the phases differ sensibly for zero and high photon number where the wkb approximation fails to reproduce the distribution @xcite .",
    "as a second illustration let us consider the two photon coherent states . these are obtained by the application of the squeezing operator @xmath72 on the coherent state @xmath73 .",
    "that is , @xmath74 again we take @xmath26 and @xmath75 real .",
    "the photon statistics is given in this case by @xcite , @xmath76 with @xmath77 the order @xmath78 hermite polynomial .",
    "for @xmath79 the photon statistics resembles that of a coherent state ( although in fact the statistics is sub - poissonian ) . as the squeezing increases , they appear the oscillations in the distribution characteristic of the phase space interference .",
    "but then for higher values of @xmath62 ( see figure ( [ fig8 ] ) ) the distribution develops different oscillating behaviors for odd and even photon numbers an effect which , as we show below , may be understood in terms of phase space interference . following the same line as in the last section take equations ( [ malfa ] ) and ( [ fim ] ) and consider , @xmath80 which define @xmath81    ]    ]    it is not difficult to show that the phase space probability amplitude @xmath82 of the two photon coherent state concentrate on an ellipse centered in @xmath83 , with one semi - axis of magnitude @xmath84 oriented through the @xmath85 axis and the other semi - axis of magnitude @xmath86 oriented through the @xmath87 axis .",
    "we represent the state by the internal region of the ellipse , @xmath88 of area @xmath89 .",
    "for high values of @xmath62 the ellipse approximates to a vertical line . in this limit",
    "the intersection points with the circumference of radius @xmath49 ( which we are using to represent the number states ) are @xmath90 and @xmath91 , with @xmath92    as in the previous case we may write the probability amplitude @xmath93 as : @xmath94 where the phases evaluated at the intersection points are given by @xmath95 and @xmath96 is one the shadowed areas in figure ( [ fig10 ] ) . it has the value @xmath97 with @xmath98 @xmath99    figures ( [ fig11 ] ) and ( [ fig12 ] ) show the comparison between the exact and approximate results for the photon statistics of a two photon coherent state .    to get a geometrical interpretation of the two branches in the photon distribution",
    "consider again the phase evaluated at ( [ ekis2bc ] ) .",
    "it may be rewritten in the form ,",
    "@xmath100 from this expression follows that the phase @xmath101 is represented by the shadowed area in figure ( [ fig9 ] ) . for high values of @xmath62",
    "this phase may be written as , @xmath102 in this case the probability is given by , @xmath103\\ ] ] which explains the differences in the probabilities of odd and even photon numbers .",
    "in the approach to quantum phase space interference presented in this paper we show a general setup , based in the properties of husimi s @xmath0 function , for the representation of quantum states as regions in phase space with a prescription for assigning phases to the different overlapping regions with a has geometrical input .",
    "we illustrate the method discussing the photon number distribution of the displaced number states and of the two photon coherent states . for the latter at high squeezing the distribution",
    "we show that the distribution develops different oscillating behaviors for odd and even photon numbers .",
    "this effect ( also displayed by squeezed states ) is understood in terms of phase space interference and maybe , in principle , suitable for experimental verification .",
