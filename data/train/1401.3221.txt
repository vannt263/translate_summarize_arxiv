    "polarimetry plays an important role in modern astrophysics .",
    "polarization measurements provide information about the nature of radiation sources , geometrical properties of the emitting regions , the spatial distribution of matter around sources , magnetic fields .    in the last two decades ,",
    "the polarimetry , especially spectropolarimetry , has advanced a lot .",
    "different polarization techniques and devices have been developed .",
    "fast ccd cameras and new polarizing materials made polarimetric observations possible for a rising number of optical telescopes .",
    "in particular , polarization measurements are important for short - living or fast variable objects such as gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and supernovae .",
    "the first polarization measurements of grbs afterglow were realized by large telescopes : the 8.2-m unit telescopes of vlt @xcite , the 10-m keck i telescope @xcite , the 6.5-m multiple mirror telescope @xcite .",
    "it s remarkable that the first detections of the early optical polarization were performed by a robotic telescope : the 2-m robotic liverpool telescope @xcite .",
    "there are also several telescopes with average - size aperture that measure grbs polarization : the 2.56-m nordic optical telescope @xcite , the 2.2-m telescope of calar alto observatory @xcite , the kanata 1.5-m telescope at higashi - hiroshima observatory @xcite , and the 1-m usno telescope in flagstaff @xcite .",
    "the early attempts to measure polarization of type ia supernovae were made by using the 2.6-m shain reflector built for the crimean astrophysical observatory @xcite .",
    "the first spectropolarimetric data were obtained on the 3.9-m anglo - australian telescope @xcite .",
    "the program of polarimetric observations of sn ia was begun on the 2.1-m struve telescope at mcdonald observatory @xcite .",
    "this program was continued on the 8.2-m unit telescopes of the vlt @xcite .",
    "spectropolarimetry is also carried out on the keck i 10-m telescope @xcite .",
    "the first master telescope was mounted in 2002 near moscow .",
    "the master net began operating in full mode in 2010 @xcite .",
    "more than 100 alert pointings at grbs were made by master .",
    "the master net holds the first place in the world in terms of the total number of first pointings , and currently more than a half of first pointings at grbs by ground telescopes are made by the master net .",
    "more than 400 optical transients have been discovered , among them cataclysmic variables , supernovae , blazars , potentially hazardous asteroids , transients of unknown nature .",
    "photometry of 387 supernovae has been carried out .",
    "polarization measurements is one of the purposes for us to design and construct the master ii robotic telescopes .",
    "the linear polarization measurements with the master net involve simultaneous observations of an object by several telescopes equipped with cross linear polarizers . since each telescope of the net has two wide - fov astronomical tubes , we have to point at least two telescopes to an object simultaneously in order to determine its stokes parameters .",
    "the unique design of master ii makes it the only wide - fov fully robotic instrument in the world able to measure polarization . in this work",
    "we report the results of the examination of its accuracy and analyze its capability to measure polarization of different types of astrophysical objects : gamma - ray bursts , supernova , blazars .",
    "each master ii telescope contains a two - tube aperture system with a total field of view of 8 square degrees , equipped with a 4000  pixel  @xmath1  4000  pixel ccd camera with a scale of @xmath2/pixel , an identical photometer with b , v , r , and i filters representing the johnson - cousins system , and polarizing filters .",
    "both optical tubes are installed on a high - speed mount with position feedback , which does not require additional guide instruments for exposures not exceeding three to ten minutes .",
    "the setup has an additional degree of freedom : the variable angle between the optical axes of the two tubes .",
    "this allows us to double the field of view during survey observations if the tubes are deflected from each other , or to conduct synchronous multi - color photometry with parallel tubes .",
    "a single telescope of the master ii net provides a survey speed of 128 square degrees per hour with a limiting magnitude of @xmath3 on dark moonless nights .",
    "astrometric and photometric calibration is made by a common method for all master observatories @xcite .",
    "bias and dark subtraction , flat field correction , and astrometry processing are made automatically .",
    "bias and dark images obtained before the beginning of observations and the closest in time flat field images , obtained on the twilight sky , are used . to convert magnitudes into absolute fluxes ,",
    "zero points of the master bands should be used .",
    "they can be found at http://master.sai.msu.ru / calibration/.    the first master polarizers were high contrast linear polarizing films combined with usual glass ( in january ",
    "july 2011 they were combined with r filter instead ) . since july 2011",
    "all polarizers have been replaced by new broadband polarizers manufactured using linear conducting nanostructure technology @xcite .",
    "magnitudes obtained from broadband photometry correspond to @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the standard johnson filters @xcite .",
    "each tube is equipped with one polarizer , the polarization directions of two tubes in a single assembly being perpendicular to one another .",
    "polarizers axes are set in two ways with respect to celestial sphere : in the master kislovodsk and the master tunka sites , the axes are directed at positional angle @xmath6 and @xmath7 to the celestial equator ( polarizers oriented at @xmath8 and @xmath9 were added in kislovodsk in april 2012 ) , in the master blagoveshchensk and the master ural , at angles @xmath8 and @xmath9 . thereby , using several master telescopes one can realize observations with different orientation of the polarizers .",
    "such a construction is very effective for fast events with significant intrinsic polarization .",
    "these events are mostly of extragalactic origin . in spite of the fact that all master telescopes have a similar construction , optical scheme , and polarizers , there are some uncertainties in the channels responses .",
    "these limit the precision of polarization measurements . also , the calibration using known polarized galactic sources is not possible , as any measurement of polarization involves subtraction of nearby field stars between at least three images , obtained with tubes with differently oriented polarizers .",
    "thus the derived polarization of a target object is always relative to the nearby field stars .",
    "they are usually chosen from the area around the target source in a radius of @xmath10 and bound to have the same polarization due to the similar interstellar matter properties toward them .",
    "the original stellar radiation is not polarized , polarization appears when light passes through the interstellar dust .",
    "interstellar polarization can reach high values and strongly depends on the galactic direction and wavelength @xcite .",
    "the goals of the master polarimetric analysis , when observing highly - polarized extragalactic events , are : to 1 ) find polarization of an event in excess of the average polarization of galactic stars in that direction , 2 ) remove additional systematic polarization introduced by the instruments , 3 ) estimate the uncertainty of polarimetric measurements by master .",
    "stars with zero polarization are required for the channel calibration .",
    "we assume the polarization of light from stars in the field of view is small .",
    "this can be checked using serkowski law @xcite .",
    "the difference in magnitudes between two polarizers orientations averaged for all reference stars gives the correction that takes into account different channel responses .",
    "gamma - ray bursts are the most powerful explosions in the universe .",
    "unfortunately , the physics of the process is not fully understood .",
    "in particular , this is due to the fact that grbs are short - living events .",
    "the spectral investigations argue for synchrotron nature of the grb emission .",
    "it is known that the synchrotron emission in ordered magnetic field is polarized .",
    "thus , observable polarization depends on the degree of coherence of magnetic fields and on the geometrical properties of the emitting regions .",
    "theoretical models with ordered magnetic field predict polarization about 20 - 30% @xcite .",
    "it is a challenge to test this prediction since grb are fast variable objects with characteristic times about tens of seconds .",
    "we formally divide optical observations of grbs into three types : afterglows , early - time , and prompt , in succession of time elapsed from the gamma trigger . historically , the optical observations of grbs progressed from afterglows to prompt .    to date , there are no robust positive observations of grb prompt emission polarization , and only several measurements of afterglow polarization , generally on a level of about 1 - 3% .",
    "these are grb990510 that showed @xmath11 polarization at around @xmath12 @xcite , grb020813 , with detected polarization varying from 2% ( @xmath13 ) to 0.8% ( @xmath14 ) @xcite , grb021004 with @xmath15% at @xmath16 @xcite and grb030329 with @xmath17% ( @xmath18 ) @xcite is the standard characteristic time for grb duration , whose values can be found in the papers cited above . ] .",
    "an exception is grb020405 for which a highly significant polarization @xmath19 ( 1.3 days after the grb ) was detected @xcite .",
    "however this result is not confirmed by measurements of other teams , which obtained @xmath20 ( 1.2 days after the grb ) @xcite ; @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( 2.2 and 3.25 days after the grb ) @xcite .    for afterglow times , we can probe the physics of a relativistic forward shock expanding into surrounding media .",
    "characteristic times can help to distinguish the nature of polarization variability as intrinsic or interstellar ( see @xcite ) .",
    "dust destruction in the vicinity of a gamma - ray burst due to the strong radiation field @xcite would result in a monotonically decreasing polarization degree with a constant position angle @xcite .",
    "for such low levels of polarization , the analysis is difficult , and distinguishing the intrinsic polarization from the polarization in the ism of milky way and host galaxy is model - dependent .",
    "thus , much effort was put to manage early - time observations , when polarization of the grb - emission itself is anticipated to be more pronounced .",
    "the origin of early optical radiation is also considered alternatively : it can be from the starting forward shock or from the reverse shock @xcite . in the latter case",
    ", polarization is expected to manifest the structure of intrinsic magnetic filed more directly .    at the front of the forward shock , patches of",
    "coherent magnetic filed may be generated stochastically .",
    "a theoretical model by @xcite suggests 10% polarization as an upper level with erratic variations of the position angle .",
    "specific patterns of polarization evolution are predicted in the models concerning beamed synchrotron radiation from a jet observed out of its symmetry axis , even if magnetic fields are completely tangled ( see references in the review by @xcite ) .",
    "so far , unfortunately , predicted patterns are not seen clearly in observations , implicating that the presumed jet models are far too simple .",
    "few early observations of optical polarization exist . for grb060218",
    ", @xcite reported an upper limit of 8% for times corresponding to the onset of the forward shock , basing on a 30 s - exposure observation started at @xmath23 .",
    "grb090102 @xcite manifested 10% polarization in the early optical emission ( a single 60 s exposure started at @xmath24 ) , with emission interpreted as an emission from a reverse shock .",
    "both polarization measurements were performed with a rotating polarizer of the 2.0-m liverpool robotic telescope .",
    "grb091208b @xcite revealed  10% in optical emission , interpreted as an early afterglow ( forward - shock emission ) obtained on the hagashi - hiroshima 1.5 m telescope , measured for an interval @xmath25 .",
    "the prompt observations , simultaneous with the gamma signal , may shed light on another physics , more directly connected with the grb engine  the structure of the magnetic field within the original outflow .",
    "prompt grb emission is thought to originate from the jet material interacting with itself .",
    "the magnetic fields can be advected from a central engine .",
    "if the fireball is electromagnetically dominated , during the first ten minutes the degree of polarization may be @xmath2640% @xcite .    for the prompt grb emission , so far only observations in gamma diapason delivered polarization results : first , grb021206 was claimed to have 80% polarized prompt gamma - emission but this was critisized later ( see @xcite ) .",
    "later , several grbs are reported with linear polarization of gamma prompt emission at levels 20 - 80% : grb041219 @xcite , grb100826a @xcite , and , recently , grb110301a and grb110721a @xcite .",
    "we would like to stress that especially in cases when optical flash is observed simultaneously with the gamma - ray emission , detection of the polarization of the grbs optical counterparts is a crucial component to our understanding of the jet physics .",
    "if it is produced by a reverse shock , intrinsic magnetic fields can be tested .",
    "the master net was designed with the objective to deliver polarization information as early as possible after grb triggers .",
    "more than 100 observations of grb were made by the master global robotic net .",
    "optical emission was detected for 11 grbs .",
    "grb100906a , grb110422a and grb121011a deserved attention because their optical observations were carried out during the gamma - ray emission . regarding the three grbs considered below ,",
    "the optical polarization observations were made by master only in two polarizers , and no significant difference was found in two channels for each of them .",
    "unfortunately , it is impossible to make a conclusion about the absence of polarization if you have observations only in two polarizers ( there is a possibility that the polarization plane lies at 45 degrees to the polarizers ) .",
    "electromagnetic radiation can be described in terms of the stokes vector , which consists of 4 components : i ( total intensity ) ; q , u ( describe linear polarization ) ; v ( describes circular polarization ) .",
    "the degree of linear polarization @xmath27 and polarization angle @xmath28 can be expressed in terms of the stokes parameters as @xmath29 .",
    "single dimensionless stokes parameter is the lower limit of the degree of linear polarization , that is , the actual @xmath27 can be positive even if one stokes parameter ( @xmath30 ) is zero with some uncertainty .",
    "the problem of probabilistic estimates of the degree of linear polarization from observations with two polarizers was addressed in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "the tunka master ii telescope pointed at the object 23 s after receiving the alert signal ( 38 s after the registration of the burst by the swift space observatory @xcite ) .",
    "the object of @xmath31 was detected .",
    "a series of frames using polarizers with exposures growing from 10  s to 180  s were obtained over the next four hours ( see table 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "the duration of the grb in the gamma - rays was @xmath32  s @xcite .",
    "thus , the first three frames of the series were obtained simultaneously with the grb .",
    "for the first three minutes , the grb was synchronously observed in optical , x - ray ( @xmath33  kev ) , and gamma diapason ( @xmath34  kev ) .",
    "note that it was the first optical polarization observations of prompt grb emission .",
    "the absolute photometry in master wide band is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc100906 ] .",
    "the differences in signals obtained in each polarization in the time interval from 100 s to @xmath35 s were computed ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "it was found that this difference is smaller than the standard deviation of @xmath30 for field stars , which is equal to 2% .",
    "the tunka master telescope was the first ground - based telescope to point at grb110422a @xcite , 53  s after beginning of the burst and 37  s after receiving the alert .",
    "the observations were carried out in both tubes in mutually perpendicular polarizations .",
    "the exposures were successively increased from 10  s to 180  s. an optical transient was detected in the very first 10-s frame .",
    "the observations were disrupted 35 min after they started because of bad weather conditions .",

    "apparently , these blazars were at quiescent states .",
    "the results emphasize once again that master polarizers are able to measure high polarization of bright objects ( @xmath54 ) .    due to the subtraction of nearby field stars between tubes with differently oriented polarizers master can not use standard galactic polarized and unpolarized objects for calibration .",
    "blazars are good candidates for calibration of master polarization degree and angle .",
    "the polarization degree of blazars can reach very high values during their period of activity as well as their brightness . on the other hand ,",
    "blazars are strongly variable sources . for calibration",
    "we need to obtain polarimetric data synchronously with other telescopes .    the degree of linear polarization and position angle of blazars oc 457 and 3c 454.3 agree with the results obtained by @xcite and the data of the virtual observatory of the laboratory of observational astrophysics of the sobolev astronomical institute at the same observational dates .",
    "in this paper , we described the goals and methods of polarimetric observations made with the master robotic net .",
    "there is a number of different classes of astrophysical objects that manifest light polarization .",
    "remarkably , most of them are the sites of high - energy phenomena . in the paper we present observations of gamma - ray bursts , one supernova , and several blazars .",
    "the polarization observations of blazars show that master s polarizers can be successfully used to measure a linear polarization degree above 5 - 10% with position angle accuracy of 310 degrees depending on brightness . observing blazars with master benefits also us as a source of calibration for the master polarization measurements .",
    "the polarization measurements are necessary for understanding the physics of grbs jets : their geometry , magnetic field , microphysics , and emission mechanisms .",
    "however , grbs prompt optical emission polarization has not been registered yet ; there are only several measurements of afterglow polarizations",
    ".    for grb100906a , grb110422a , and grb121011a , we present the polarization measurements of the prompt optical emission .",
    "unfortunately , in each case , only two orthogonal polarizers took part in observations , thus only a lower limit on polarization is deduced and the position angle remains undefined .",
    "the dimensionless stokes parameter is estimated to be less than an observational error for single objects , which equals to 2% in master observations .",
    "we notice that the typical dispersion of the stokes parameter of field stars in master observations is 5% .",
    "thus , master telescopes can safely register linear polarization in excess of 10% and marginally detect polarization just above 5% .",
    "a level of 10% for the degree of linear polarization is predicted by some theoretical models of grb emission .",
    "the supernova phenomena can last several months .",
    "it allows us to obtain long data series including polarimetry .",
    "the discovery of significant polarizations from type ia supernovae will be an independent argument for the model of merging white dwarfs as one of the evolutionary path to such supernovae .",
    "moreover , if some of sne ia are suspected to be asymmetric , it will raise a question about their suitability for cosmology as precise standardizable candles .",
    "recent data shows modest continuum polarization ( less than 1% ) of sne ia but stronger line polarization ( @xmath55 )",
    ". low continuum polarization of sne ia light could indicate that the explosion is nearly spherical .",
    "but theoretical predictions on the polarization degree from asymmetric explosions are strongly model dependent .",
    "furthermore , observed polarization can be contaminated by interstellar polarization in our galaxy and in the host galaxies .",
    "it is important to remind that the present number of supernovae with good measurements of polarization prior to maximum light is still not enough to make a conclusion about the explosion geometry in this class of supernovae .",
    "we present photometry in polarizers of type ia sn 2012bh observed by master from march 27 to april 15 .",
    "the light curve of sn 2012bh looks similar to the light curve of the `` normal '' type ia sn 1994d .",
    "the analysis of the light curve shows that the maximum brightness was on march 31 .",
    "the resulting 1-@xmath56 upper limit on the linear polarization degree of sn 2012bh is 3% .",
    "further spectropolarimetric and polarimetric observations of sne ia are needed to investigate explosion geometry and matter distribution around supernova and along the line of sight .",

    "<S> we present results of optical polarization observations performed with the master robotic net @xcite for three types of objects : gamma - ray bursts , supernovae , and blazars . for the swift gamma - ray bursts grb100906a , grb110422a , grb121011a , polarization observations were obtained during very early stages of optical emission . for grb100906a it was the first prompt optical polarization observation in the world . </S>",
    "<S> photometry in polarizers is presented for type ia supernova 2012bh during 20 days , starting on march 27 , 2012 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the linear polarization of sn 2012bh at the early stage of the envelope expansion was less than 3% . </S>",
    "<S> polarization measurements for the blazars oc 457 , 3c 454.3 , qso b1215 + 303 , 87 gb 165943.2 + 395846 at single nights are presented . </S>",
    "<S> we infer the degree of the linear polarization and polarization angle . </S>",
    "<S> the blazars oc 457 and 3c 454.3 were observed during their periods of activity . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that master is able to measure substantially polarized light ; at the same time it is not suitable for determining weak polarization ( less than 5% ) of dim objects ( fainter than @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> polarimetric observations of the optical emission from gamma - ray bursts and supernovae are necessary to investigate the nature of these transient objects .    </S>",
