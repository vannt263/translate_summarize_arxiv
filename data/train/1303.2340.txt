    "reduced @xmath16 is found to be 0.4 .",
    "this small reduced @xmath16 value indicates that the elliptical orbital model `` over - fits '' data .",

    "then the square of the third order polynomial term is divided into the value from monte carlo simulations ( deeter 1984 , cordes 1980 ) .",
    "the torque noise strength is obtained as @xmath5 hz sec@xmath6 .",
    "this value of noise strength estimate is comparable with those of other accretion powered sources such as wind accretors e.g. vela x@xmath01 , 4u 1538@xmath052 and gx 301@xmath02 which has the values changing between @xmath26 and @xmath27 hz s@xmath6 ( bildsten et al .",

    "+    a preliminary spectral analysis for the first pointed observations of swift j1729.9@xmath03437 was performed by markwardt et al .",
    "( 2010b ) . in this paper",
    ", we extend the spectral study by using all the available observations of the source defined in section 2 .",
    "basically , the spectra can be modelled by a power law with a high energy cut - off and photoelectric absorption as it is suggested by markwardt et al .",
    "( 2010b ) . among the several models that describe the cut - off power law ,",
    "the best fit is achieved by ` cutoffpl ` model in ` xspec ` .",
    "an additional gaussian component is also required for a weak _ fe _ emission line around 6.4 kev . during the simultaneous fitting of _ _ swift__@xmath0xrt and _ _ rxte__@xmath0pca spectra we included a multiplicative constant factor in the model to account for the normalization uncertainty between the two instruments . the data and its best fit are plotted in fig .",

    "the energy ranges for the simultaneous spectral analysis are initially selected to be 0.3@xmath09.3 kev for the xrt spectrum and 3@xmath025 kev for the pca spectrum .",
    "individually these spectra have similar shapes that can be modelled with the same models , apart from an offset in absolute flux calibration .",
    "however individual modelling of the data from different instruments yields different absorption parameters due to different instrumental band - passes ( markwardt et al .",
    "2010b ) . during the simultaneous fitting trials we observe large residuals for the first energy bins of the pca spectrum",
    "although the fit is adequate for the xrt spectrum . therefore we exclude energies below 5 kev for the pca spectrum , since the xrt spectrum has more spectral energy bins in soft x - rays .",
    "the fov of pca is large and swift j1729.9@xmath03437 is near the galactic ridge . the thermal emission from the ridge is usually known to contaminate the spectral count rates of the source . during the analysis of the first pca observation , the weak line at @xmath76.6 kev reported by markwardt et al .",
    "( 2010b ) was suggested to be a contamination , since it could not be resolved in the spectrum of the first xrt observation .",
    "we tried to handle this issue in overall pca spectrum with fixed additive galactic ridge models .",
    "we confirm that the flux of the source is two orders of magnitude bigger than the flux of the galactic ridge ( valinia & marshall 1998 ) therefore we conclude that the contamination could be small enough to be neglected . furthermore ; addition of the gaussian model component for the _ fe _ line improves the individual fit of the 0.3@xmath09.3 kev xrt spectrum after combining data from all xrt observations by reducing the reduced @xmath15 from 1.08 ( @xmath36d.o.f .",
    "@xmath37 ) to 0.98 ( @xmath36d.o.f .",
    "@xmath38 ) .",
    "the f - test probability that this improvement is achieved just by chance is @xmath39 .",
    "therefore we suggest that the _ fe _ emission originates from swift j1729.9@xmath03437 . the line energy found for the source",
    "is shifted from the neutral value of _ fe _ k@xmath40 ( @xmath76.4 kev ) , which may be a consequence of an excess of ionization .    in accretion powered pulsars , the _ fe _ k@xmath40 line is produced by the reprocessing of the hard x - ray emission in the relatively low ionized and cool matter surrounding the pulsar .",

    "1989 ) is specified to be the evidence for the fluorescence of x - ray continuum by the cold material . as the continuum intensity increases the illumination of the matter increases and the line intensity strengthens .",
    "we measure _ fe _ line flux values from the individual _ rxte _ observations of swift j1729.9@xmath03437 by using the ` cflux ` model in ` xspec ` and find that they correlate with the source flux values ( see fig .",

    "this correlation also confirms the origin of the _ fe _ emission .",
    "we construct pulse phase resolved spectra of swift j1729.9@xmath03437 from the first three rxte@xmath0pca observations .",
    "there are two motivations to the data selection .",
    "first , the brightest of the observations are selected to ensure the best signal - to - noise ratio possible .",
    "second , the selected observations are the only ones that have 256 channels good xenon event mode data available , which is required for the ` fasebin ` tool .",
    "the timing solution found for the source in section 3.1 is appended to the timing files of the ` fasebin ` tool for correct phase - binning .",
    "the pulse period is divided into five equal segments resulting in @xmath72.1 ks exposure time for each phase bin spectrum .",
    "we model 3@xmath025 kev spectra with the same models used for the overall spectrum in the previous section .",
    "as we do not observe any significant change in the hydrogen column density ( @xmath43 ) and the _ fe _ line energy during the preliminary fitting trials , we fixed these parameters during the analysis in order to better constrain the other parameters of the fits .",
    "the photon index and the folding energy of the high energy cut - off ( @xmath44 ) are found to be varying within pulse phases ( see fig .",
    "[ phasespe ] ) .",
    "the phase dependence of photon index is in anti - correlation with the pulsed flux .",
    "the pearson product - moment correlation coefficient between pulsed flux and photon index values is @xmath45 and the corresponding null - hypothesis probability ( two - tailed ) is 0.06 .",
    "the null - hypothesis probability of this anti - correlation is quite significant but our results still indicate that the softest emission is observed at the un - pulsed phase around 0.05 ; from which we might suggest a possible physical relation between the parameters .",
    "the @xmath44 values show a similar trend as the photon index values , which means softer spectra have higher cut - off energies .",
    "the pearson product - moment correlation coefficient between @xmath44 and photon index values is 0.96 and the corresponding null - hypothesis probability ( two - tailed ) is 0.01 .",
    "although the correlation analysis indicates a strong dependence between the parameters , one should note that the uncertainties in the parameters are not taken into account during this analysis .",
    "when the large uncertainties in @xmath44 values are taken into account the data is consistent with a constant value of @xmath46 kev .",
    "therefore it is difficult to infer a clear variation of the @xmath44 with the pulse phase , suggesting a rather marginal detection .",
    "in this paper , we study timing and spectral properties of swift j1729.9@xmath03437 using _ rxte _ and _ swift _ observations of its outburst from 2010 july 20 through 2010 august 12 ( mjd 55397 @xmath0 mjd 55420 ) . from these observations with a time span of @xmath47 days , we find that arrival times can be fit to a quadratic . from this fit , we calculate a spin frequency and spin frequency derivative of @xmath1 hz and @xmath2 hz / s respectively .",
    "the residuals of the quadratic is further found to fit a circular orbital model with @xmath48 lt.s and an orbital period of 15.3(2 ) days .",
    "we also try an elliptical model and find an upper limit for eccentricity as 0.60 .",
    "however , this model over - fits the data with a reduced @xmath16 of 0.40 .",
    "future observations might help to refine orbital parameters of the source .",
    "using this @xmath49 value , we find the mass function ( @xmath50 ) to be about @xmath4 . an orbital period of 15.3 days and a spin period of 533.76 s puts the source in line with the accretion powered pulsars with supergiant companions , in the corbet diagram ( drave et al .",
    "2012 , corbet 1984 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the small mass function obtained from the circular orbital model should be an indication of a small orbital inclination angle .",
    "if the circular orbital model is preferred as the model fitting the residuals of the quadratic fit , this indicates that we observe the binary system nearly edge - on .",
    "alternatively the residuals of the quadratic fit can be explained by a torque noise strength of @xmath5 hz sec@xmath6 .",
    "this value is quite consistent with other accreting x - ray binaries ( baykal & gelman 1993 , bildsten et al .",
    "future observations are needed to understand the exact nature of the source .",
    "initially , a double - peaked pulse profile is observed in the light curves of the source .",
    "then we find that one peak loses its intensity starting from the middle of the observation on mjd 55406.7 as the source flux continues to decrease after the burst . to study the energy dependence and temporal variability of the pulse profiles , we construct pulse profiles with five different energy bands shown in fig .",
    "[ enrespp ] .",
    "we observe stronger pulses in the 8@xmath013 kev and 13@xmath018 kev energy bands but generally the pulse shape shows no strong energy dependence .",
    "double to single peak transition seen in this source might be due to a sharp decline in the intensity of the radiation coming from the fan beam , since the formation of fan beam strongly depends on the luminosity of the source as for exo 2030 + 375 ( parmar et al .",
    "1989 ) and gx 1 + 4 ( paul et al . 1997 )",
    ". however lack of significant energy dependence of the pulse profiles makes the fan beam explanation implausible since fan beams are expected to be spectrally harder than pencil beams .    in order to have a basic understanding of spectral variability of the whole observations , we study hardness ratios of the source . from the hardness ratio plots ( see fig . [ hard ] ) , we suggest that the emitted radiation becomes softer as the source flux decreases during the ongoing decline of the outburst .",
    "the similar spectral softening with decreasing flux was reported before for 1a 0535 + 262 , a 1118@xmath0616 , swift j1626.6@xmath05156 , xte j0658@xmath0073 and gro j1008@xmath057 using hardness - intensity relations ( reig & nespoli , 2013 ) .    to extend the preliminary spectral analysis of markwardt et al .",

    "we find that adding an _ fe _ line complex feature with a peak at 6.51 kev slightly improves the spectral fit .",
    "we discuss that this _ fe _ line feature is more likely originated from the source as the galactic ridge emission is too weak to explain this emission alone .",
    "we also measure _ fe _ line flux values from the individual _ rxte _ observations of the source and find that they correlate with the source flux values ( see fig .",

    "<S> we analyse _ rxte _ and _ swift _ observations of swift j1729.9@xmath03437 after its outburst from 2010 july 20 to 2010 august 12 . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate a spin frequency and spin frequency derivative of @xmath1 hz and @xmath2 hz / s respectively from the quadratic fit of the pulse arrival times.the quadratic fit residuals fit well to a circular orbital model with a period of @xmath3 days and a mass function of about @xmath4 , but they can also be explained by a torque noise strength of @xmath5 hz sec@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> pulse profiles switch from double - peaked to single - peaked as the source flux continues to decrease . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the pulse shape generally shows no strong energy dependence . </S>",
    "<S> the hardness ratios reveal that the source becomes softer with decreasing flux . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a single spectrum from all the available _ rxte _ and _ swift _ observations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that adding an _ fe _ line complex feature around 6.51 kev slightly improves the spectral fit . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that _ fe _ line flux correlates with x - ray flux which might indicate the origin of the _ fe _ emission as the source itself rather than the galactic ridge .    </S>",
