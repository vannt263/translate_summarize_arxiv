    "legal text , along with other natural language text data , e.g. scientific literature , news articles or social media , has seen an exponential growth on the internet and in specialized systems . unlike other textual data ,",
    "legal texts contain strict logical connections of law - specific words , phrases , issues , concepts and factors between sentences or various articles .",
    "those are for helping people to make a correct argumentation and avoid ambiguity when using them in a particular case .",
    "unfortunately , this also makes information retrieval and question answering on legal domain become more complicated than others .",
    "there are two primary approaches to information retrieval ( ir ) in the legal domain @xcite : manual knowledge engineering ( ke ) and natural language processing ( nlp ) . in the ke approach ,",
    "an effort is put into translating the way legal experts remember and classify cases into data structures and algorithms , which will be used for information retrieval .",
    "although this approach often yields a good result , it is hard to be applied in practice because of time and financial cost when building the knowledge base .",
    "in contrast , nlp - based ir systems are more practical as they are designed to quickly process terabytes of data by utilizing nlp techniques .",
    "however , several challenges are presented when designing such system .",
    "for example , factors and concepts in legal language are applied in a different way from common usage @xcite .",
    "hence , in order to effectively answer a legal question , it must compare the semantic connections between the question and sentences in relevant articles found in advance @xcite . given a legal question , retrieving relevant legal articles and deciding whether the content of a relevant article can be used to answer the question are two vital steps in building a legal question answering system .",
    "kim et al .",
    "@xcite exploited ranking svm with a set of features for legal ir and convolutional neural network ( cnn ) @xcite combining with linguistic features for question answering ( qa ) task . however , generating linguistic features is a non - trivial task in the legal domain .",
    "carvalho et al .",
    "@xcite utilized n - gram features to rank articles by using an extension of tf - idf . for qa task ,",
    "the authors adopted adaboost @xcite with a set of similarity features between a query and an article pair @xcite to classify a query - article pair into  yes \" or  no \" .",
    "however , overfitting in training may be a limitation of this method .",
    "sushimita et al .",
    "@xcite used the voting of hiemstra , bm25 and pl2f for ir task .",
    "meanwhile , tran et al .",
    "@xcite used hidden markov model ( hmm ) as a generative query model for legal ir task .",
    "kano @xcite addressed legal ir task by using a keyword - based method in which the score of each keyword was computed from a query and its relevant articles using inverse frequency . after calculating ,",
    "relevant articles were retrieved based on three ranked scores .",
    "these methods , however , lack the analysis of feature contribution , which can reveal the relation between legal and nlp domain .",
    "this paper makes the following contributions :    * we conduct detailed experiments over a set of features to show the contribution of individual features and feature groups .",
    "our experiments benefit legal domain in selecting appropriate features for building a ranking model . *",
    "we analyze the provided training data and conclude that : ( i ) splitting legal articles into multiple single - paragraph articles , ( ii ) carefully initializing parameters for cnn significantly improved the performance of legal qa system , and ( iii ) integrating additional features in ir task into qa task leads to better results . *",
    "we propose to classify a query - article pair into `` yes '' or `` no '' by voting , in which the score of a pair is generated from legal ir and legal qa model .    in the following sections , we first show our idea along with data analysis in the context of coliee .",
    "next , we describe our method for legal ir and legal qa tasks . after building a legal qa system ,",
    "we show experimental results along with discussion and analysis .",
    "we finish by drawing some important conclusions .",
    "in the context of coliee 2016 , our approach is to build a pipeline framework which addresses two important tasks : ir and qa . in figure [ fig : coliee_proposed_model ] , in training phase , a legal text corpus was built based on all articles .",
    "each training query - article pair for lir task and lqa task was represented as a feature vector .",
    "those feature vectors were utilized to train a learning - to - rank ( l2r ) model ( ranking svm ) for ir and a classifier ( cnn ) for qa .",
    "the red arrows mean that those steps were prepared in advance . in the testing phase , given a query @xmath0 , the system extracts its features and computes the relevance score corresponding to each article by using the l2r model .",
    "higher score yielded by svm - rank means the article is more relevant . as shown in figure [ fig : coliee_proposed_model ] , the article ranked first with the highest score , i.e. 2.6 , followed by other lower score articles . after retrieving a set of relevant articles ,",
    "cnn model was employed to determine the  yes \" or  no \" answer of the query based on these relevant articles .",
    "the published training dataset in coliee 2016miyoung2/coliee2016/ ] consists of a text file containing japanese civil code and eight xml files .",
    "each xml file contains multiple pairs of queries and their relevant articles , and each pair has a label  yes \" or  no \" , which confirms the query corresponding to the relevant articles .",
    "there is a total of 412 pairs in eight xml files and 1,105 articles in the japanese civil code file , and each query can have more than one relevant articles .    after analyzing the dataset in the civil code file",
    ", we observed that the content of a query is often more or less related to only a paragraph of an article instead of the entire content .",
    "based on that , each article was treated as one of two types : single - paragraph or multiple - paragraph , in which a multiple - paragraph article is an article which consists of more than one paragraphs .",
    "there are 7 empty articles , 682 single - paragraph articles and the rest are multiple - paragraph . based on our findings",
    ", we proposed to split each multiple - paragraph article into several independent articles according to their paragraphs .",
    "for instance , in table [ tab : multiple - article ] , the article 233 consisting of two paragraphs was split into two single - paragraph articles 233(1 ) and 233(2 ) .",
    "after splitting , there are in total 1,663 single - paragraph articles .",
    ".[tab : multiple - article ] splitting a multiple - paragraph article into some single - paragraph articles [ cols=\"^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     interestingly , article 653 has the highest relevant score in non - splitting method and rank @xmath1 in splitting approach .",
    "the reason for this is that article 653 shares other words like _ mandatary _ , _ mandator _ as well .",
    "therefore , it makes retrieval system confuse and yield incorrect order rank . by using single - paragraph ,",
    "the system can find more accurately which part of the multiple - paragraph article is associated with the query s content .",
    "this work investigates ranking svm model and cnn for building a legal question answering system for japan civil code .",
    "experimental results show that feature selection affects significantly to the performance of svm - rank , in which a set of features consisting of _ ( lsi , manhattan , jaccard ) _ gives promising results for information retrieval task . for question",
    "answering task , the cnn model is sensitive to initial values of parameters and exerts higher accuracy when adding auxiliary features .    in our current work ,",
    "we have not yet fully explored the characteristics of legal texts in order to utilize these features for building legal qa system .",
    "properties such as references between articles or structured relations in legal sentences should be investigated more deeply .",
    "in addition , there should be more evaluation of svm - rank and other l2r methods to observe how they perform on this legal data using the same feature set .",
    "these are left as our future work .",
