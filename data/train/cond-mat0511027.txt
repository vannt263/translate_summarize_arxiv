    "spin transport in semiconductor structures is a subject of much interest from the perspective of both fundamental physics and device applications .",
    "a number of different formalisms have been used to study this problem , primary among which are a classical drift diffusion approach @xcite , a kinetic theory approach @xcite , and a microscopic semiclassical approach @xcite .",
    "the central result of the drift diffusion approach is a differential equation that describes the spatial and temporal evolution of carriers with a certain spin polarization @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite derived this equation for a number of special cases starting from the wigner distribution function . in a coordinate system where the x - axis coincides with the direction of electric field driving transport , this equation is of the form : @xmath1 where @xmath2 @xmath3 is the diffusion coefficient , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are dyadics ( 9-component tensors ) that depend on @xmath3 , the mobility @xmath6 and the spin orbit interaction strength in the material",
    ".    solutions of equation ( [ spin ] ) , with appropriate boundary conditions , predict that the ensemble averaged spin @xmath7 = @xmath8 should decay exponentially with @xmath9 according to : @xmath10 where @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the strength of the driving electric field and @xmath13 is a parameter related to the spin orbit interaction strength .    the quantity",
    "@xmath14 is the characteristic length over which @xmath15 decays to @xmath16 times its original value .",
    "therefore , it is defined as the `` spin diffusion length '' .",
    "equation ( [ diffusion ] ) clearly shows that spin diffusion length depends on the _ sign _ of the electric field @xmath12 .",
    "it is smaller for upstream transport ( when @xmath12 is positive ) than for downstream transport ( when @xmath12 is negative ) .",
    "this difference assumes importance in the context of spin injection from a metallic ferromagnet into a semiconducting paramagnet .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the spin injection efficiency across the interface between these materials depends on the difference between the quantities @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the spin diffusion length in the semiconductor , @xmath20 is the conductivity of the semiconductor , @xmath21 is the conductivity of the metallic ferromagnet , and @xmath22 is the spin diffusion length in the metallic ferromagnet .",
    "generally , @xmath23 .",
    "however , at sufficiently high retarding electric field , @xmath24 , so that @xmath25 . when this equality is established , the spin injection efficiency is maximized .",
    "thus , ref .",
    "@xcite claimed that it is possible to circumvent the infamous `` conductivity mismatch '' problem @xcite , which inhibits efficient spin injection across a metal - semiconductor interface , by applying a high retarding electric field in the semiconductor close to the interface .",
    "a tunnel barrier between the ferromagnet and semiconductor @xcite or a schottky barrier @xcite at the interface does essentially this and therefore improves spin injection .",
    "the result of ref .",
    "@xcite depends on the validity of the drift diffusion model and equation ( [ decay ] ) which predicts an exponential decay of spin polarization in space . without the exponential decay",
    ", one can not even define a `` spin diffusion length '' @xmath14 .",
    "the question then is whether one expects to see the exponential decay under all circumstances , particularly in quantum confined structures such as quantum wires .",
    "the answer to this question is in the _ negative_. equation ( [ spin ] ) , and similar equations derived within the drift diffusion model , do not account for energy quantization in quantum confined systems and neglect the influence of subband structure on spin depolarization .",
    "this is a serious shortcoming since in a semiconductor quantum wire , the spin orbit interaction strength is _ different _ in different subbands .",
    "it is this difference that results in dyakonov - perel ( d - p ) spin relaxation in quantum wires . without this difference ,",
    "the d - p relaxation will be completely absent in quantum wires and the corresponding spin diffusion length will be always infinite @xcite .",
    "the suband structure is therefore vital to spin relaxation .",
    "in this paper , we have studied spin relaxation using a microscopic semiclassical model that is derived from the liouville equation for the spin density matrix @xcite .",
    "our model has been described in ref .",
    "@xcite and wil not be repeated here .",
    "this model allows us to study dyakonov - perel spin relaxation taking into account the detailed subband structure in the system being studied .    in technologically important semiconductors , such as gaas ,",
    "spin relaxation is dominated by the dyakonov - perel ( d - p ) mechanism @xcite .",
    "this mechanism arises from the dresselhaus @xcite and rashba @xcite spin orbit interactions that act as momentum dependent effective magnetic fields @xmath26 .",
    "an electron s spin polarization vector @xmath27 precesses about @xmath28 according to the equation @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the angular frequency of spin precession and is related to @xmath31 as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the electron s effective mass . if the direction of * b ( * k * ) * changes randomly due to carrier scattering which changes * k * , then ensemble averaging over the spins of a large number of electrons will lead to a decay of the ensemble averaged spin in space and time .",
    "this is the physics of the d - p relaxation in bulk and quantum wells . in a quantum wire ,",
    "the direction of * k * never changes ( it is always along the axis of the wire ) in spite of scattering .",
    "nevertheless , there can be d - p relaxation in a _ multi - subband _ quantum wire , as we explain in the next paragraphs .",
    "thus , * b ( * k * ) * lies in the x - z plane and subtends an angle @xmath43 with the wire axis ( x - axis ) given by @xmath44\\ ] ]    note from the above that in any given subband in a quantum wire , the _ direction _ of @xmath31 is fixed , irrespective of the magnitude of the wavevector @xmath40 , since @xmath43 is independent of @xmath40 . as a result , there is no d - p relaxation in any given subband , even in the presence of scattering .",
    "however , @xmath43 is different in different subbands because the dresselhaus interaction is different in different subbands .",
    "consequently , as electrons transition between subbands because of inter - subband scattering , the angle @xmath43 , and therefore the direction of the effective magnetic field @xmath31 , changes .",
    "this causes d - p relaxation in a _ multi - subband _ quantum wire .",
    "since spins precess about different axes in different subbands , ensemble averaging over electrons in all subbands results in a gradual decay of the net spin polarization .",
    "thus , there is no d - p spin relaxation in a quantum wire if a single subband is occupied , but it is present if multiple subbands are occupied and inter - subband scattering occurs .",
    "this was shown rigorously in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the subband structure is therefore critical to d - p spin relaxation in a quantum wire .",
    "in fact , if a situation arises whereby all electrons transition to a single subband and remain there , further spin relaxation due to the d - p mechanism will cease thereafter . in this case , spin no longer decays , let alone decay exponentially with distance .",
    "hence , spin depolarization ( or spin relaxation ) can not be parameterized by a constant spin diffusion length .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe our model system , followed by results and discussions in section iv .",
    "finally , we conclude in section v.",
    "we consider a non centro - symmetric ( e.g. gaas ) quantum wire with axis along [ 100 ] crystallographic direction .",
    "we choose a three dimensional cartesian coordinate system with @xmath45 coinciding with the axis of the quantum wire ( refer fig . [ model ] ) .",
    "the structure is of length @xmath46 with rectangular cross section : @xmath47 nm and @xmath48 nm . a metal gate is placed on the top ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ model ] ) to induce the symmetry breaking electric field @xmath49 , which causes the rashba interaction . in a quantum wire defined by split schottky gates on a two - dimensional electron gas ,",
    "@xmath49 arises naturally because of the triangular potential confining carriers near the heterointerface .",
    "we assume @xmath50 kv / cm @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is another electric field @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) which drives transport along the axis of the quantum wire .",
    "consider the case when _ spin polarized _ monochromatic electrons are constantly injected into the channel at @xmath53 with injection velocities along @xmath54 . if these electrons occupy only the lowest subband _ at all times",
    "_ , then there will be no dyakonov - perel relaxation @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to study multisubband effect on spin dephasing of upstream electrons , we inject them with enough energy ( @xmath55 ) that they initially occupy multiple subbands .",
    "we ignore any thermal broadening of injection energy @xcite since @xmath56 for the range of temperature ( @xmath57 ) considered , @xmath58 being boltzmann constant .",
    "let @xmath59 denote the energy at the bottom of @xmath60th subband ( @xmath61 etc . ) .",
    "we place @xmath55 between the @xmath62-th and @xmath63-th subband bottoms as shown in fig .",
    "[ subband ] . in other words , @xmath64 .",
    "we assume that the injected electrons , each with energy @xmath55 , are distributed uniformly over the lowest @xmath62 subbands .",
    "in other wordes , at time @xmath65 , electron population of the @xmath66 th @xmath67 subband is given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the total number of injected electrons and @xmath12 denotes their energies .",
    "at any subsequent time @xmath70 , these distributions spread out in space ( @xmath71 ) , as well as in energy , due to interaction of the injected electrons with the electric field @xmath72 and numerous scattering events .",
    "relative population of electrons among different subbands will change as well due to intersubband scattering events . _",
    "upstream _ electrons originally injected into , say , subband @xmath60 with velocity @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) , gradually slow down because of scattering and the decelerating electric field .",
    "they change their direction of motion ( i.e. become _ downstream _ ) beyond a distance @xmath75 measured from the injection point @xmath76 .",
    "thus , no electrons will be found in the @xmath60-th subband beyond @xmath77 .",
    "note that the value of @xmath75 depends on three factors : the initial injection velocity into subband @xmath60 , the decelerating electric field and the scattering history . on the other hand ,",
    "the ` classical turning distance ' of monochromatic electrons injected into the @xmath60-th subband with energy @xmath78 for a given electric field @xmath72 is given by @xmath79 where @xmath59 is the energy at the bottom of the @xmath60-th subband and @xmath80 is the injection velocity in the @xmath60-th subband .",
    "note that @xmath81 does not depend on scattering history and @xmath81 = @xmath77 in ballistic transport .",
    "clearly @xmath82 for a given @xmath55 ( see fig .",
    "[ subband ] ) .",
    "thus , for a given channel electric field @xmath72 , @xmath83min@xmath84 . hence we concentrate on the region @xmath85 where , almost _ all _ injected electrons are _ upstream _ electrons . in the simulation ,",
    "velocity of every electron is tracked and as soon as an electron alters direction and goes downstream ( i.e. its velocity becomes positive ) it is ignored by the simulator and another upstream electron is simultaneously injected from @xmath86 randomly in any of the @xmath62 lowest subbands with equal probability .",
    "this process is continued for a sufficiently long time till electron distributions over different subbands , @xmath87 , no longer change with time . under this condition",
    "we say that _ steady state _",
    "is achieved for the upstream electrons .",
    "this steady state electron distribution is extended from @xmath88 to @xmath86 and heavily skewed near the region @xmath86 .",
    "this steady state distribution of upstream electrons _ does not _ represent the local equilibrium electron distribution because of two reasons : ( a ) upstream electrons are constantly injected into the channel at @xmath86 ; this is the reason why the distribution is skewed near @xmath86 and ( b ) we exclude any downstream electron from the distribution . at local equilibrium",
    ", there will be of course both upstream and downstream electrons in the distribution .",
    "the model above allows us to separate upstream electrons from downstream electrons and therefore permits us to study upstream electrons in isolation . of course",
    ", in a real quantum wire , both upstream and downstream electrons will be present at any time , even in the presence of a strong electric field , since there will be always some non - vanishing contribution of back - scattered electrons to the upstream population .",
    "the semiclassical model and the simulator used to simulate spin transport have been described in ref .",
    "@xcite . based on that model , at steady state",
    ", the magnitude of the ensemble averaged spin vector at any position @xmath9 inside the channel is given by @xmath89    here @xmath90 , @xmath91 , denotes the ensemble average of @xmath92 component of spin at position @xmath9 .",
    "subscript @xmath60 implies that ensemble averaging is carried out over electrons _ only _ in the @xmath60 th subband .",
    "the above equation can be simplified to @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 is the angle between @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "note that in absence of any intersubband scattering event , @xmath98 for all @xmath9 ( i.e. initial spin polarization of the injected electrons ) @xcite .",
    "simulation results that we present in the next section can be understood using equation ( [ avgspin1 ] ) .",
    "we examine how ensemble averaged spin polarization of upstream electrons @xmath99 varies in space for different values of driving electric field @xmath72 and injection energy ( @xmath55 ) for a fixed lattice temperature @xmath57 .",
    "we vary @xmath72 in the range @xmath100kv / cm for constant injection energy @xmath101 mev and @xmath57 = 30 k , where @xmath55 is measured from the bulk conduction band energy as shown in fig .",
    "[ subband ] .",
    "the lowest subband bottom is 351 mev above the bulk conduction band edge .",
    "we also present results corresponding to @xmath102 mev with @xmath103kv / cm and @xmath104k . in all cases mentioned above",
    ", injection energies lie between subband 3 and subband 4 .",
    "injected electrons are equally distributed among the three lowest subbands initially .",
    "obviously , this corresponds to a non - equilibrium situation .",
    "all injected electrons are 100% spin polarized transverse to the wire axis ( i.e either @xmath105 or @xmath106 ) .",
    "figures [ halffieldspin]-[twofieldspin ] , [ 90mev ] , and [ pos75mev - z ] show how ensemble averaged spin components @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 of upstream electrons evolve over space .",
    "figures [ halffieldspin]-[twofieldspin ] show the influence of the driving electric field on spin relaxation , fig .",
    "[ 90mev ] shows the influence of initial injection energy and fig .",
    "[ pos75mev - z ] shows the influence of the intial spin polarization .",
    "it is evident that neither the driving electric field , nor the initial injection energy , nor the intial spin polarization has any significant effect on spin relaxation .",
    "note that @xmath111 does _ not _ decay exponentially with distance , contrary to equation ( [ decay ] ) .",
    "spatial distribution of electrons over different subbands is shown in fig .",
    "[ halffieldsub ] - [ twofieldsub ] , and fig .",
    "[ sub90mev ] .",

    "[ sub90mev ] shows the influence of initial injection energy on the spatial evolution of subband population .",
    "as expected , @xmath113 decreases with increasing electric field in accordance with equation ( [ clas ] ) .",
    "note that at low electric field ( figs . 7 and 8) @xmath114 since all subbands are getting nearly depopulated of `` upstream '' electrons at @xmath9 = @xmath112 . recall that @xmath115 only if transport is ballistic ; therefore we can conclude that upstream transport is nearly ballistic in the range @xmath113 when @xmath72 @xmath116 1 kv / cm . at high electric field , when @xmath72 @xmath117 1.5 kv / cm , ( fig .",
    "10 ) @xmath118 .",
    "this indicates that there are many upstream electrons even beyond the classical turning point .",
    "it can only happen if there is significant scattering that drives electrons against the electric field , making them go beyond the classical turning point .",
    "we can also deduce that most of these scattering events imparts momentum to the carriers to _ aid _ upstream motion rather than oppose it , since @xmath118 .",
    "this behavior is a consequence of the precise nature of the scattering events and would not have been accessible in drift - diffusion models that typically treat scattering via a relaxation time approximation .",
    "note that even though electrons are injected equally into all three subbands , most electrons end up in subband 3  the highest subband occupied initially  soon after injection . beyond a certain distance ( @xmath119 )",
    "subbands 1 and 2 become virtually depopulated .",
    "this feature is very counter - intuitive and represents a _ population inversion _ of upstream electrons !",
    "it can be understood as follows : scattering rate of an electron with energy @xmath12 is proportional to the density of the final state . in a quantum wire ,",
    "density of states has @xmath120 dependence where @xmath59 is the energy at the bottom of the @xmath60th subband .",
    "as the injected electrons move upstream they gradually cool down and their energies approach the energy at the bottom of subband 3 ( @xmath121 ) . to visualize this , imagine the horizontal line @xmath55 in fig .",
    "[ subband ] sliding down with passage of time .",
    "as @xmath121 is approached , electrons will increasingly scatter into subband 3 since the density of final state in subband 3 is increasing rapidly . to scatter into a final state in subband 2 or 1 that has",
    "the same density of state as in subband 3 will require a much larger change in energy and hence a much more energetic phonon which is rare since the phonons obey bose einstein statistics .",
    "therefore , subband 3 is the overwhelmingly preferred destination and this preference increases rapidly as electrons cool further .",
    "consequently , beyond a certain distance , virtually all electrons are scattered to subband 3 leaving subbands 1 and 2 depleted .",
    "this feature is a peculiarity of quasi one - dimensional system and will _ not _ be observed in bulk or quantum wells .",
    "exact values of @xmath112 and @xmath122 depend on injection energy and electric field . in the field range @xmath123kv / cm and injection energy @xmath101 mev , @xmath124 . however , for higher values of electric field ( e.g.  2kv / cm ) or smaller values of injection energies , electrons reach classical turning point even before subbands 1 and 2 get depopulated .    because of electron bunching in subband 3 , spin dephasing in the region @xmath125",
    "is governed by equation ( 6 ) with @xmath126 .",
    "we observe a few subdued oscillations in @xmath99 in this region because of the `` sine term '' in equation ( [ avgspin1 ] ) .",
    "however , in the region @xmath127 subbands 1 and 2 are almost depopulated .",
    "therefore , there is no d - p relaxation in the interval @xmath127 since only a single subband is occupied @xcite .",
    "consequently , the ensemble averaged spin assumes a constant value @xmath128 and does not change any more .",
    "thus in this region , one can say that spin dephasing length becomes infinite .",
    "it should be noted that it is meaningless to study spin dephasing in the region @xmath129 because electrons do not even reach this region .",
    "in this paper , we have used a semiclassical model to study spin dephasing of upstream electrons in a quantum wire , taking into account the subband formation .",
    "we showed that the subband structure gives rise to rich features in the spin dephasing characteristics of upstream electrons that can not be captured in models which fail to account for the precise physics of spin dephasing and the fact that it is different in different subbands .",
    "because spin relaxation in a multi - subband quantum wire is non - exponential ( even non - monotonic ) in space , it does not make sense to invoke a `` spin diffusion length '' , let alone use such a heuristic parameter to model spin dephasing .",
    "finally , we have found a population inversion effect for upstream electrons .",
