    "blazars are active galactic nuclei ( agn ) with strong jets forming a small angle w.r.t . the line of sight and emitting variable , non - thermal radiation across the entire electromagnetic spectrum @xcite .",
    "although intrinsically rare , blazars are being detected in increasingly larger numbers by extragalactic surveys .",
    "in fact , although only @xmath5 blazars are currently known @xcite , their number is steadily growing thanks to , e.g. , the _ fermi _",
    "@xcite , the optical sloan digital sky survey ( sdss : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the planck @xcite surveys .",
    "some faint blazars are also being detected as serendipitous sources in swift - xrt images @xcite .",
    "blazars come in two main subclasses , whose major difference lies in their optical properties : 1 ) flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) , which show strong , broad emission lines in their optical spectrum , just like radio quiet qsos ; and 2 ) bl lacs , which are instead characterized by an optical spectrum , which at most shows weak emission lines , sometimes displays absorption features , and in many cases can be completely featureless . historically , the separation between bl lacs and fsrqs has been made at the ( rather arbitrary ) equivalent width ( ew ) value of 5  , rest - frame by @xcite and observed - frame by @xcite .",
    "however , the search for a possible bimodal distribution in the ew of the broad lines of radio quasars has been unsuccessful .",
    "indeed , @xcite pointed out that radio - selected bl lacs were , from the point of view of the emission line properties , very similar to fsrqs but with a stronger continuum .",
    "most bl lacs selected in the x - ray band , on the other hand , had very weak , if any , emission lines , and @xcite , when studying the properties of the x - ray selected einstein medium sensitivity survey ( emss ) sample , had to introduce another criterion to identify bl lacs , this time to separate them from normal galaxies .",
    "this was based on the ca h&k break , a stellar absorption feature typically found in the spectra of elliptical galaxies at @xmath6  .",
    "given that its value in non - active ellipticals is @xmath7 , @xcite chose a maximum value of 25% to ensure the presence of a substantial non - thermal continuum superposed to the host galaxy spectrum .",
    "this was later revised to 40% @xcite .",
    "based on all the above , it is clear that blazar classification depends then on the details of their appearance in the optical band where they emit a mix of three types of radiation : 1 ) a non - thermal , jet - related , component ; 2 ) thermal radiation coming from the accretion onto the supermassive black hole and from the broad line region ( at least in most radio selected sources ) ; 3 ) light from the host ( giant elliptical ) galaxy .",
    "the strong non - thermal radiation , the only one that spans the entire electromagnetic spectrum , is composed of two broad humps , a low - energy one attributed to synchrotron radiation , and a high - energy one , usually thought to be due to inverse compton radiation @xcite .    motivated by this observational background , @xcite ( 2012 , see also @xcite ; @xcite ) run simulations to try to explain the many selection effects that bias the fsrq / bl lac classification .",
    "these simulations included , amongst other ingredients , the blazar luminosity function and evolution , the thermal , non - thermal and host galaxy components , and the peak frequency of the synchrotron emission and ew distributions .",
    "once the simulated samples had been produced , the bias effects were introduced , in order to compare the simulations with the real samples .",
    "these biases are basically the limiting fluxes , to assess whether or not a source is detected by a specific survey , and the _ diluted _ ew , which depends ( apart from the _ intrinsic _ ew ) on the shape and intensity of the simulated non - thermal emission and the host galaxy light , and determines whether a source gets classified as a bl lac or an fsrq .",
    "one of the results of this analysis was that what we call a bl lac can either be an object with a strong non - thermal continuum ( possibly due to strong doppler factors ) , which heavily dilutes its lines below the ( arbitrary ) dividing value of ew @xmath8   , or a source with intrinsically weak emission lines .",
    "radio surveys tend to preferentially select the first type of sources ( as these are intrinsically radio powerful ) , while x - ray surveys select mainly sources with lower radio power , related to low - ionization radio galaxies ( lergs ) and therefore optically featureless .",
    "the consequence of this scenario is that the first kind of sources are classified as bl lacs only because they have a strong non - thermal emission , or a high doppler boosting , which swamp their emission lines .",
    "such objects are intrinsically fsrqs and so they should be classified . on the other hand , most x - ray selected bl",
    "lacs are truly ( or nearly ) featureless and constitute the genuine bl lac class @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to test these predictions through x - shooter optical and infrared spectroscopy of a sample of bl lacs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "2 we describe the criteria adopted to build our sample ; in sect .",
    "3 we deal with the x - shooter observations and the data reduction process ; in sect .",
    "4 we present our results ; finally in sect .",
    "5 we discuss our findings and draw our conclusions .",
    "an effective way of searching for fsrqs that have been erroneously misclassified is to observe bl lacs at @xmath9 in the infrared band .",
    "this is because at these redshifts one of the most prominent emission lines in blazars , h@xmath1 ( rest - frame wavelength @xmath10 ) moves out of the wavelength range where optical spectroscopy is normally done . in this scenario ,",
    "some blazars might have been classified as bl lacs only because one of their strongest and less contaminated emission lines falls beyond the spectroscopic range normally used to classify blazars .    to verify this possibility , we selected a small sample of bl lacs to be observed at infrared wavelengths as follows : we started from the bzcat catalogue @xcite and singled out all radio - selected bl lacs with good visibility from paranal ( @xmath11 ) , @xmath12 , and a firm redshift identification ( at least two lines detected in emission , @xcite ) .",
    "we then removed the objects for which the h@xmath1 line was expected to fall in regions dominated by atmospheric absorption features . since the observed redshift distribution of bl lacs peaks at very low redshifts , our final sample includes only five objects , which are listed in table 1 .",
    "three of these have a redshift @xmath13 , and the h@xmath1 line falls in the j band , while the other two have a redshift @xmath14 and the h@xmath1 is in the h band .",
    "we observed our blazar sample with x - shooter @xcite , a single - object medium resolution ( @xmath15 ) echelle spectrograph mounted at the vlt - ut2 telescope .",
    "the observations were carried out under programme 091.b-0092 . the choice of x - shooter as operating instrument stems from its capabilities to perform simultaneous optical and ir spectroscopy with a single exposure . this way we can also study the ratio between optical and ir band lines without being affected by the variability typical of blazars .    for both observations",
    "the slit width was set to 0.9 in the visual ( vis ) and near - infrared ( nir ) arms , and 1.0 in the ultra - violet and blue ( uvb ) arm .",
    "the uvb and vis ccd detectors were rebinned to @xmath16 pixels ( binned in the spectral direction but not in the spatial one ) to reduce the readout noise . with this configuration ,",
    "the nominal resolution is different for the three arms : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 for the uvb , vis , and nir arms , respectively .",
    "all our targets were observed during eso period p91 , i.e. , between 1 april and 30 september 2013 .",
    "the list of observations is reported in table 1 , together with the observing dates and the total exposure times .",
    "sources requiring more than 1 hour of integration were observed more than once . each observation",
    "is constituted by several exposures , taken nodding along the slit with an offset of @xmath20 between exposures , following a standard abba pattern .",
    "we processed the spectra using version 1.4.5 of the x - shooter data reduction pipeline @xcite .",
    "the pipeline carries out the following steps : the raw frames are first bias - subtracted , and cosmic ray hits are detected and removed using the method developed by @xcite .",
    "the frames are divided by a master flat field obtained using day - time flat field exposures with halogen lamps .",
    "the orders are extracted and rectified in wavelength space using a wavelength solution obtained from day - time calibration frames .",
    "the resulting rectified orders are shifted and co - added to obtain the final two - dimensional spectrum . in the overlapping regions ,",
    "orders are merged by weighing them using the errors propagated during the reduction process . from the resulting two - dimensional merged spectrum ,",
    "a one - dimensional spectrum with the corresponding error file and bad pixel map was extracted at the source position .",
    "telluric corrections were applied for spectra whose features fall in regions strongly contaminated by sky lines .",
    "the iraf task _ telluric _ was adopted to perform this correction .",
    "flux calibration is not required by the goal of our work , since we are interested only in line spectroscopy .",
    "normalized spectra have thus been produced and used throughout this work .",
    "@xmath21 @xcite ; @xmath22 @xcite ; @xmath23 @xcite ; @xmath24",
    "we computed the rest - frame ews for the emission lines of our sources , which are given in table 2 .",
    "the ews have been computed through direct line integration .",
    "errors have been estimated resampling the spectra and take into account both the normalization uncertainties and the s / n of the spectra .",
    "we discuss the sources individually in the following sub - sections .      for this blazar we detected the mgii doublet at @xmath26 and three oxygen lines , namely , [ oii ] and the [ oiii ] doublet ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "a redshift of @xmath27 is derived , in agreement with that reported by @xcite . despite a very high s / n ratio",
    ", we can not detect hydrogen emission lines , but the h@xmath1 feature falls in a region contaminated by several sky lines .",
    "an intervening system is detected at @xmath28 , featuring absorption by the mgii @xmath292796,2803 , feii@xmath292586,2600 doublets , and the feii@xmath302382 line .",
    "this is the blazar featuring the most prominent emission lines in our sample .",
    "we confirm the redshift of this source to be @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "five lines have been detected , namely , the mgii doublet , [ oii ] , the [ oiii ] doublet and h@xmath1 .",
    "the h@xmath32 line falls in a telluric region , so only a shallow upper limit could be set . the h@xmath1 line rest - frame ew is higher than @xmath33  .",
    "all the other features detected in the optical band have instead values @xmath34 . bzbj0238 + 1636 , previously classified as a bl lac due to the ew of its optical lines , should be re - classified as an fsrq according to its strong h@xmath1 feature in the ir band .",
    "the detected emission lines are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "@xcite have carried out a spectroscopic monitoring of this source , finding that the ew of the mgii line was strongly dependent on its magnitude , being smaller when the source was brighter .",
    "our rest - frame mgii ew @xmath35   is consistent with this trend , as this object was in a relatively bright state at the time of our observations ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "this blazar is almost completely featureless .",
    "we only report a tentative detection of the mgii doublet at the redshift @xmath37 , consistent with that by @xcite .",
    "in addition , we detect the intervening absorber seen by @xcite at @xmath38 , which features the mgii@xmath39 doublet and the [ mgi@xmath40 line , which gives more robustness to our redshift determination . since the main emission lines should fall in regions relatively free of sky lines , this might suggest that we have caught bzbj2031 + 1218 in a high state , during which the thermal emission is overwhelmed by the non - thermal one .",
    "if this is the case , the emission lines are diluted by the synchrotron emission below the detection threshold of our spectrum .",
    "only upper limits for [ oii ] , the [ oiii ] doublet , h@xmath32 and h@xmath1 have been set at the redshift of @xmath37 ( see table 2 ) .",
    "this blazar shows three emission lines , namely , [ oii ] , [ oiii]@xmath305007  and h@xmath1 .",
    "we found a redshift of @xmath41 , consistent with that reported by @xcite .",
    "for the h@xmath32 and [ oiii]@xmath304959   features we could set only upper limits .",
    "however , the [ oiii ] doublet falls in a region highly contaminated by sky lines .",
    "it is interesting to note that the h@xmath32 lower limit is about eight times smaller than the h@xmath1 value , despite the ratio between the two oscillator strengths being only @xmath42 .",
    "we do not detect the mgii emission line reported in @xcite nor the mgii intervening absorber at @xmath43 .",
    "however , the reported ew of the intervening mgii system ( @xmath44 ) is below our detection threshold .",
    "the detected emission lines are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "this blazar shows four emission lines , namely [ oii ] , the [ oiii ] doublet and h@xmath1 .",
    "the redshift determined for this object is @xmath45 , consistent with @xcite . for the h@xmath32 feature",
    "only an upper limit could be set .",
    "again , we note that this lower limit is more than ten times lower than the h@xmath1 value , despite the ratio between the two oscillator strengths is just a factor of @xmath42 .",
    "the detected emission lines are displayed in fig .",
    "we have looked for h@xmath1 emission in the ir spectra of five bl lacs at @xmath9 . we have found that two sources ( bzbj0238 + 1636 , rest - frame ew @xmath3    and bzbj2134@xmath250153 , observed ew @xmath3   ) could be classified as fsrqs by one of the classification criteria that have been used in the literature .",
    "indeed , bzbj0238 + 1636 was defined as an `` intruder '' bl lac in @xcite .",
    "this is because its high @xmath46-ray luminosity and eddington ratio resemble those of typical fsrqs , despite its @xmath46-ray energy index being border - line between the two classes .",
    "concerning bzbj2134@xmath250153 , its classification is ambiguous , since it was considered an fsrq in the 1lac catalog @xcite and a bl lac in the 2fgl one @xcite .",
    "its @xmath46-ray luminosity of @xmath47 erg s@xmath48 and its wise colors ( see @xcite ) better place this object in the fsrq class .",
    "in addition , given the steep nir - to - uv slope , if the redshift of this object were @xmath49 , a strong ly-@xmath1 line would have been detected , definitely placing bzbj2134@xmath250153 in the fsrq class . a third source in our sample shows border - line ( observed ) ew ( bzbj2243@xmath252544 , ew = @xmath4   ) .",
    "the remaining two objects show very weak lines or nearly featureless spectra .",
    "our sample shows that , whenever emission lines are present , h@xmath1 is always the most prominent one ( the only exception being bzbj0141@xmath250928 , for which it falls in a region strongly contaminated by sky lines ) .",
    "this appears to be the case even if this feature falls relatively close to the peak of the synchrotron emission in our sources , which are low synchrotron - peaked bl lacs .",
    "in this situation the synchrotron emission , which is non - thermal , should strongly dilute the thermal processes such as the h@xmath1 emission lines .",
    "h@xmath1 turns then out to be very important if one has to rely on a classification scheme that discriminates bl lacs from fsrqs according to the ew of their lines . in this context",
    "ir spectroscopy turns out to be vital for relatively high redshift ( @xmath9 ) sources .",
    "the danger of source misclassification based solely on ew strength has been recently stressed also by @xcite .",
    "they studied multi - epoch spectra of more than 300 blazars , finding that for six of them the ew of their emission lines crossed the @xmath33  dividing line in different observations .",
    "these objects have high accretion rates , strong variability both in the thermal and non - thermal continuum and a synchrotron peak frequency similar to that of fsrqs .",
    "@xcite propose that these sources are likely fsrqs whose jet axis points extremely close to the line of sight .",
    "this peculiar geometry causes the emission lines to be strongly diluted by the non - thermal continuum when the latter is particularly strong .",
    "they conclude , similarly to @xcite , that a simple classification based on the ew strength may lead to consider these fsrqs as bl lacs and to a wrong evaluation of the bl lac evolution , especially at high redshifts .",
    "this effect could be even more severe when considering that blazars with redshift larger than @xmath50 , currently classified as bl lacs , could be in fact fsrqs with the h@xmath1 emission line in the ir window .",
    "thus , a new , ew - independent operational definition for `` bl lac object '' is needed .",
    "such a picture has also strong implications on blazar classification and evolution and on the so - called `` blazar sequence '' , and predicts the association of `` real '' bl lacs with lergs and `` fake '' bl lacs with high - ionization radio galaxies ( hergs ) .",
    "in particular , the evolution derived for fsrq samples in the radio , and also @xmath46-ray , band could be biased by the exclusion of relatively high - redshift misclassified sources .",
    "given the role that radio emission is thought to play in galaxy evolution through the so - called `` radio mode '' accretion @xcite , this is also relevant for `` agn feedback '' via the selection of relatively high - redshift hergs but especially lergs , which being intrinsically less powerful are harder to identify , already at moderately high redshifts , through blazar samples .",
    "we thank the referee and the editors for helpful comments .",
    "this work is based on observations made with eso telescopes at the la silla paranal observatory under programme i d 091.b-0092 .",
