    "since the pioneering work of zwicky ( 1933 ) , astronomers have found compelling evidence to suggest that the major contribution to the overall mass density of the universe is in the form of _ dark _ matter .",
    "even if its precise nature remains unknown ( see e.g. @xcite for a recent review ) , the currently favoured hypothesis of _ cold _ dark matter ( cdm ) is in good agreement with an enormous body of data : anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , large - scale structure surveys , cluster abundances , structure of the lyman-@xmath4 forest and a host of other measurements ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , in the past 30 years , upper limits on the cmb anisotropies and predictions made by theories of galaxy formation have been extremely effective at ruling out models based on purely _ baryonic _ or _ hot _ dark matter ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the quality of astrophysical data has improved and it currently seems likely that the present fractional overall energy density @xmath5 includes contributions from a cosmological constant @xmath0 ( @xmath6 ) and from cold ( @xmath7 ) , hot ( @xmath8 ) and baryonic ( @xmath9 ) dark matter .",
    "also , it appears that the densities of these components are all within one or two orders of magnitude of each other . while the similar densities of dark ` energy ' and ` matter ' can possibly be explained by advocating a quintessence scalar field which ` tracks ' the matter density ( @xcite ) , the reason why the densities of the @xmath10 matter components are so similar is not so apparent .",
    "predictions made by structure evolution theories based on the @xmath0cdm model disagree with some galaxy observations , which suggests that , for the model to hold , assumptions made about the properties of cdm particles must be modified ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . if this reasoning is adopted , currently discussed versions of the present cosmological scenario , incorporating a fine - tuned cosmological constant and dark matter particles with _ ad hoc _ properties , lose the compelling aesthetic simplicity of the original cdm model ( see @xcite for a recent review )",
    "of course , other , more astrophysical , resolutions may be possible @xcite .",
    "the recent cmb anisotropy measurements from the boomerang-98 ( @xcite ) and maxima-1 ( @xcite ) experiments have provided new insights into the cosmological parameters .",
    "for the first time , the anisotropy angular power spectrum has been measured over a wide range of angular scales , from multipole @xmath11 up to @xmath12 with errors of the order of @xmath13 .",
    "the data sets confirm that there is a peak in the angular power spectrum at @xmath14 with a steep decline in power from @xmath15 to @xmath16 . while the presence of such a peak is consistent with the predicted acoustic oscillations in the adiabatic inflationary scenario , the absence of prominent secondary peaks after @xmath17 is an unexpected result , suggesting that the value for the physical baryonic density is @xmath18 higher than that predicted by big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we note however that this discrepancy with the standard model is no more than 2 @xmath19 when the most recent cmb anisotropy results are included @xcite .    in recent months",
    ", several solutions have been advocated to reconcile bbn with the larger values of the baryon density suggested by the cmb data . in a recent letter by mcgaugh ( 2000 ) , the simple and controversial solution of considering only baryonic dark matter ( bdm ) plus a cosmological constant has been proposed .",
    "the lower cmb second peak can thereby be explained by the collisional damping expected in a bdm universe , while maintaining the baryon density at a level compatible with the bbn constraint .",
    "as is well known , purely baryonic adiabatic models are in severe contradiction with the measured amplitude and shape of galaxy and cluster correlations",
    ". however , there remain serious issues about the possibly scale - dependent bias parameter .",
    "hence mcgaugh s result is interesting for various reasons : it resolves the disagreement with bbn by using a simpler model ( @xmath20 ) , it demonstrates the model - dependence of theoretical fits to the cmb data by exploring a previously uncovered corner of parameter space and , finally , it questions our theoretical understanding of the structure formation process .",
    "if it turns out that the cdm hypothesis does not work well at some cosmological epochs and scales , then even the exotic scenario of a purely baryonic model with modifications to standard gravity could become competitive , especially in view of the insistence of mond proponents that this alternative theory of gravity merits serious examination ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it is timely to study how compatible the cmb data is with a bdm adiabatic universe , what consequences this assumption can have on the remaining cosmological parameters , and the need for cdm from independent observations of galaxy clustering .    in this _ letter _ , we perform an analysis in cosmological parameter space . using the recent cmb data _ alone _ we show that a purely baryonic adiabatic model appears unlikely if the universe is flat ( @xmath1 ) . by further combining these results with supernova type ia ( snia ) data , we rule out baryonic adiabatic models with high confidence .",
    "the structure of the @xmath21 spectrum depends essentially on 3 cosmological parameters ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) : the physical baryonic density @xmath22 and the overall matter density @xmath23 which define the size of the acoustic horizon at decoupling , and the ` shift ' parameter @xmath24 related to the geometry of the universe through @xmath25 , with @xmath26^{-1/2 } dz}$ ] , where the function @xmath27 depends on the curvature of the universe and is @xmath28 , @xmath29 or @xmath30 for flat , closed and open models respectively .",
    "a decrease in @xmath31 , with @xmath32 and @xmath24 remaining constant , will reduce @xmath33 .",
    "this decreases the redshift of equality causing the peak in the spectrum to be shifted towards smaller angular scales .",
    "constant @xmath33 can be maintained by increasing @xmath32 .",
    "however , an increase in @xmath32 will decrease the sound speed at decoupling @xmath34 again reducing the acoustic horizon size and shifting the peak to higher @xmath35 s .    to keep the position of the first peak fixed while @xmath32 and @xmath33 are varied",
    ", @xmath24 has to be appropriately tuned .",
    "this can be achieved by increasing @xmath6 .",
    "the shift parameter @xmath24 is sensitive to variations in @xmath6 as @xmath36 , and for @xmath37 a @xmath13 increase in @xmath6 can produce a @xmath38 decrease in @xmath39 .",
    "thus , a purely baryonic model can produce the observed peak structure at @xmath40 only if @xmath24 is increased with respect to the corresponding flat cdm model .",
    "we can therefore anticipate that viable purely baryonic models will be @xmath0-dominated with closed geometries .",
    "motivated by these considerations , we compare recent cmb and snia observations with a set of models with parameters sampled as follows : @xmath41 ; @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we vary the spectral index of the primordial density perturbations within the range @xmath44 and we rescale the fluctuation amplitude by a pre - factor @xmath45 , in units of @xmath46 . the theoretical models are computed using the publicly available cmbfast program ( @xcite ) and are compared with the recent boomerang-98 and maxima-1 results . the power spectra from these experiments",
    "were estimated in @xmath47 and @xmath48 bins respectively , spanning the range @xmath49 . in each bin ,",
    "the spectrum is assigned a flat shape , @xmath50 .",
    "following bond , jaffe & knox ( 1999 ) we approximate the signal @xmath51 inside the bin to be an offset lognormal distribution , such that the quantity @xmath52 ( where @xmath53 is the offset correction ) is a gaussian variable . the likelihood for a given cosmological model",
    "is then defined by @xmath54 where @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) is the theoretical ( experimental ) band power , @xmath53 is the offset correction and @xmath57 is the gaussian curvature of the likelihood matrix at the peak .",
    "we consider @xmath13 and @xmath58 gaussian distributed calibration errors for the boomerang-98 and maxima-1 experiments respectively .",
    "we also include the cobe data using lloyd knox s radpack packages .",
    "proceeding as in dodelson & knox ( 2000 ) , we attribute a likelihood to a point in the ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) and ( @xmath9 , @xmath61 ) planes by finding the remaining @xmath10 parameters that maximise it .",
    "we then define our @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 contours to be where the likelihood falls to @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 of its peak value , as would be the case for a two dimensional multivariate gaussian .",
    "in the top panel of figure 1 , we plot likelihood contours in the ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) plane by applying the maximization / marginalization algorithm described above and using only the boomerang-98 data and limiting our analysis to models with age @xmath68 .",
    "as expected , the low sound speed at decoupling due to the high baryon content makes only closed models compatible with the observations .",
    "the deviation from flatness becomes less and less important as @xmath69 , as one would expect from the expression for @xmath24 .",
    "however , the decrease in the redshift at equality causes positive curvature models to be preferred .    in the parameter range",
    "we are sampling , we find that flat models are excluded at @xmath70 . in order to further test the discrepancy with a flat universe we also include cdm models in the analysis with @xmath71 . comparing our models to the boomerang-98 data alone and restricting the analysis to @xmath1",
    ", we find that @xmath72 at the @xmath73 c.l .",
    "thus flat bdm models are excluded with significance .    for the boomerang-98 analysis with @xmath74 ,",
    "the best - fitting model is a closed model with @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and the boomerang-98 calibration left untouched .",
    "this provides a good fit to the data ( see figure 2 , top panel ) . including the maxima-1 data points produces a different best - fitting model : @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath79 with a @xmath84 upward calibration    fig .",
    "1. the likelihood contours in the ( @xmath85 , @xmath60 ) plane , with the remaining parameters taking their best - fitting values .",
    "only the boomerang-98 data is considered here .",
    "the contours correspond to 0.32 , 0.05 and 0.01 of the peak value of the likelihood , which are the 68% , 95% and 99% confidence levels respectively .",
    "the dashed line going from left to right diagonally across the plot indicates flat models .",
    "the top panel is with a prior on the age of the universe @xmath86 gyr .",
    "the bottom panel includes the bbn prior @xmath87 and the snia data .",
    "the results of these two priors are incompatible at @xmath88 .",
    "[ fig : like_mar1 ]    for the boomerang-98 points and a @xmath89 downward calibration for maxima-1 .",
    "as the low value of @xmath45 already suggests , these best - fitting models are in contradiction with the cobe data . including cobe in the boomerang-98 analysis",
    "does not significantly affect the best - fitting cosmological parameters which remain @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , but the model now requires @xmath90 and an upward shift in the calibration for boomerang-98 of @xmath91 .",
    "this model is ruled out by the cobe and boomerang-98 data at the 95% c.l . , although this discrepancy can be resolved by adding a gravitational wave ( gw ) contribution on large scales .",
    "the top panel of figure 2 indicates that the inclusion of a gw component such that @xmath92 leaves the small scale behaviour practically unchanged but provides enough cmb power on large scales to match the cobe normalization .    a gw contribution as large as @xmath93 is incompatible at the @xmath63 c.l . with flat @xmath0cdm models when",
    "the bbn prior is assumed in cmb analyses ( @xcite ) .",
    "gws leave a characteristic imprint on polarization power spectra , via fluctuations in the @xmath94 magnetic - type - parities channel ( @xcite , @xcite ) that vanish in the case of scalar fluctuations .",
    "however , the expected polarization amplitude for bdm models is very low , below @xmath95 , and future experiments will not have the sensitivity to detect the @xmath94 channel signal unless a substantial amount of reionization occurred in the past ( @xcite ) .",
    "2. in the top panel , the boomerang-98 and the cobe data are plotted together with the best - fitting baryonic model to the boomerang-98 data . in order to fit the cobe data , a tensor component must be added . for comparison ,",
    "the @xmath0-cdm concordance model is also plotted .",
    "the middle panel shows the expected polarization signal of the best - fitting model . including the tensor components produces @xmath94 modes in the polarization spectra . in the bottom panel",
    "it can be seen that the best - fitting model to the boomerang-98 data is in contradiction with the matter power spectrum measured by the pscz survey .",
    "[ fig : like_mar ]    one can further combine the cmb constraints with those obtained from the luminosity  distance measurements of high-@xmath96 supernovae ( @xcite ) as we do in the bottom panel of figure 1 . the inclusion of the snia data does not greatly affect the constraints on @xmath6 but , as expected , it rules out any models with low values of @xmath97 .",
    "we find that @xmath98 at the @xmath73 c.l . and an increasing inconsistency of bdm models with a flat universe .",
    "also plotted in the bottom panel of figure 1 are the constraints obtained including a prior @xmath99 ( @xcite ) inferred by measurements of primordial elements and assuming standard bbn .",
    "the results of the @xmath100 priors are incompatible at more than @xmath2 .",
    "it is interesting to further explore the compatibility of our results with independent observations by considering likelihood contours in the ( @xmath97 , @xmath61 ) plane .",
    "3 plots the results of our analysis with no priors , the results including the snia data and the results    fig .  3. the likelihood contours in the ( @xmath101 , @xmath61 ) , with the remaining parameters taking their best - fitting values to the boomerang-98 data .",
    "the contours correspond to 0.32 , 0.05 and 0.01 of the peak value of the likelihood , which are the 68% , 95% and 99% c.l . respectively .",
    "the filled contours correspond to an analysis with a @xmath86 gyr prior .",
    "the dashed , dotted and solid contours to the right of the plot are the result when the snia data is included .",
    "the bold black line to the left of the plot is the @xmath73 c.l .",
    "region from bbn .",
    "[ fig : like_omh]with the bbn constraint .",
    "we can see from this figure that purely baryonic models are in quite good agreement with boomerang-98 and with the bbn constraints .",
    "however , when the snia data is included we are restricted to models with values of @xmath9 that are too high and values of @xmath61 that are too low to be consistent at @xmath102 with both the bbn constraint and the recent hst result @xmath3 ( @xcite ) .",
    "quite independently of the prior assumed , we find that the age of the universe in this scenario is constrained to be @xmath103 gyr , nearly double that expected from standard cdm .",
    "the age of the universe must exceed the ages of the oldest globular clusters @xmath104 gyr by an amount @xmath105 gyr , so the age of the universe required by these models seems to be too high unless globular cluster formation is delayed for a very long time .",
    "collisional damping erases fluctuations in the matter power spectrum on scales @xmath106 .",
    "the predicted matter power spectrum from the best - fitting model ( see figure 2 , bottom panel ) is in contradiction with the decorrelated linear power spectrum extracted from the recent pscz catalogue ( @xcite ) . allowing for a shift in the overall amplitude with a bias factor @xmath107 where @xmath108",
    ", we obtain a best - fitting bias @xmath109 with a @xmath110 which is an extremely poor fit to 22 data points with one free parameter . the theoretical variance in baryonic matter fluctuations over a sphere of size @xmath111 , for example",
    ", is @xmath112 to be compared with the observational value @xmath113 ( @xcite ) .",
    "so , rescaling the galaxy data with a massive bias parameter may not be physically meaningful since no galaxies would have formed in order to allow there to be a predicted galaxy power spectrum .",
    "various phenomenological mechanisms can be proposed in an attempt to resolve the discrepancy with the matter power spectrum and render bdm models viable .",
    "one such possibility is to increase the spectral index of the primordial density fluctuations , @xmath114 .",
    "however , the blue models that are able to produce @xmath115 require @xmath116 which is outside the range @xmath117 allowed by inflation ( @xcite ) . also , such a high tilt will cause the cmb spectrum to become incompatible with observations .",
    "another option that could increase small scale density perturbations whilst leaving the cmb spectrum unchanged is to have a spectral index that varies with scale , @xmath118 , as predicted by some inflationary models ( @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the variation needed , @xmath119 , is much greater than that predicted by the most viable models .",
    "more recently , there has been some investigation into features in the primordial power spectrum generated during inflation ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible that such features could increase the perturbations on small scales without affecting the cmb spectrum , although it is doubtful that a single feature would be able to resolve the observed discrepancy and such a mechanism is unlikely to be preferable to the assumption of cdm itself .",
    "we have examined cmb anisotropies and large - scale structure observations in a purely baryonic dark matter universe .",
    "our results suggest that a bdm adiabatic universe with a power - law primordial power spectrum can only reproduce the sub - degree cmb measurements if the universe is closed . although the premise that @xmath1 is considered to be one of the basic predictions of the inflationary scenario , it is possible to construct inflationary scenarios that predict closed universes ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that removing cdm immediately forces us to construct a more elaborate inflationary model , or , in other words , the most simple model needs non - baryonic matter to work .",
    "when flatness was assumed , we found that @xmath120 at @xmath121 with @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , the flatness constraint with bbn renders @xmath123 models less consistent with the cmb observations than the standard @xmath124 model .",
    "also , @xmath123 models that fit the bbn constraints are degenerate with a non - physical region of the parameter space ( with very high baryon content and small @xmath61 ) .",
    "when any cosmological prior other than bbn is assumed in the analysis , the unphysical region turns out to be preferred . including the snia constraints ( or @xmath125 ) , for example , makes the parameter space incompatible at @xmath126 confidence with both the hst constraint @xmath3 and with bbn .",
    "as expected , all the bdm adiabatic models fail to reproduce both the cmb observations and the observed amount of galaxy clustering on @xmath111 scales . in order to solve all the discrepancies , that are not present in the standard @xmath0cdm scenario",
    ", we need to introduce _ ad hoc _ mechanisms which are unlikely to be preferable to the assumption of cdm itself .",
    "nonetheless , bdm models leave a set of characteristic imprints such as large scale @xmath94-mode polarization and no third acoustic peak in the anisotropy spectrum that will allow future experiments to further scrutinize this hypothesis ."
