    "the heavy mass of the @xmath0 quark , around 5 gev , so much greater than the strong interaction scale @xmath5 gev and the fact that it belongs to the same isospin doublet than the top quark , confere a special role to the @xmath0 quark studies .",
    "furthermore the top quark is too heavy to build hadrons and thus @xmath0 hadrons are the heaviest . in that respect ,",
    "@xmath0 physics is a broad subject and one of the major areas of investigation of present experiments at cesr , lep , slc and tevatron colliders .",
    "experimentally @xmath0 hadrons are easier to observe or to disentagle from other sources because tracks issued from their decays have higher transverse momentum and momentum due to the high mass and the hard fragmentation of the @xmath0 hadrons .",
    "the lifetime of @xmath0 hadrons ( @xmath6 1 ps ) is relatively long and the subsequent presence of secondary vertices in detector can be used as a tag ; for instance the mean decay length is 3 mm at lep .",
    "they have also sizeable semileptonic branching ratios which allow to sign @xmath0 events with the presence of leptons , cleanly identified , in decay products .",
    "specific theoretical framework can be used for the description of the properties of @xmath0 hadrons such as heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) where a @xmath0 hadron is considered like a hydrogen atom , heavy quark symmetry ( hqs ) in the limit @xmath7 or heavy quark expansion ( hqe ) which allows expansions in @xmath8 .",
    "the main issues in @xmath0 physics are to provide precision tests in the electroweak sector of the standard model ( sm ) , to study the decay dynamics , especially the effect of strong interactions on the underlying quark decay , to understand the origin of cp violation and to measure the magnitude of the ckm matrix elements @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath4 , and to observe rare processes which can probe physics beyond the sm . a selection of subjects is reviewed and , due to space limitations , only a short summary is given .",
    "more extensive recent summaries can be found in @xcite .",
    "production in z decays , lifetimes , -  oscillations and decays are mainly discussed in the following .",
    "most of the given averages are provided by lep working groups  @xcite .    in the field of beauty hadron spectroscopy ,",
    "the main result is the observation and measurement of the @xmath9 meson , by cdf at tevatron , with a mass of @xmath10 gev / c@xmath11 and a lifetime of @xmath12 ps .",
    "more details can be found in the presentation of j. troconiz , where recent results from tevatron are covered .",
    "the relative ease with which @xmath0 quarks can be separated from other quark flavours and the availability of large @xmath13 event samples allow precision tests of the standard model to be carried out using @xmath14 decays at @xmath15 colliders . by the end of the lep i phase ( 1989 - 1995 ) , each of the four lep experiments had recorded approximately 3.8 10@xmath16 @xmath17 , including nearly 0.8 10@xmath16",
    "@xmath14 decays , while by the end of 1997 sld at slc had recorded approximately 0.3 10@xmath16 @xmath17 with polarized beams .",
    "@xmath18 : due to the large mass of the @xmath0 quark and the fact that it belongs to the same isospin doublet than the top quark , the z-@xmath19 coupling is one of the most interesting windows in the search for new physics . the partial width ratio @xmath20 is sensitive to @xmath21 via vertex corrections , while the corrections in @xmath22 and @xmath23 are suppressed in a first approximation . a precision measurement of @xmath18 would therefore represent a unique test of the standard model and would provide significant constraints on possible new physics such as additional higgs bosons or supersymmetry .",
    "the first @xmath18 measurements were done using leptons  @xcite . in inclusive charged lepton analyses ,",
    "the preferred approach is to fit a two - dimensional distribution ( p , p@xmath24 ) for single lepton and dilepton events together , and extract simulatneously @xmath18 with other parameters as for instance @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    "relatively large systematic errors remain due mainly to uncertainties in the modelling of the semileptonic decay of the @xmath0 quark ; these measurements were not precise enough to perform a stringent test . then the informations from silicon vertex detector were used and thanks to the large statistics available , `` double tagging '' techniques , were applied .",
    "the double tagging technique exploits the fact that the @xmath0 and @xmath27 quarks are typically produced back to back , in separate hemispheres as defined by the thrust axis .",
    "a @xmath0 quark tag is applied separately to each hemisphere in a sample of hadronic events and the total number of single and double - tagged events are measured .",
    "assuming backgrounds from charm and light quark events and the correlations between the hemispheres from monte carlo , as well as @xmath25 from its sm value , both @xmath18 and the @xmath0 tagging efficiency can be extracted from data . in 1995",
    "the world average @xmath18 showed a discrepancy with more than 3@xmath28 ( dominated by systematics ) from the sm , and it was shown that charm systematics were a worry ( exponential charm lifetime tail ( @xmath29 ) is difficult to cut away ) and so a @xmath0 purity of 94 % was not enough controlled , as well as the understanding of the correlations .",
    "a new round of analyses has been performed  @xcite .",
    "an increased purity is achieved by exploiting @xmath30 hadrons masses and kinematical differences , by including for instance the invariant mass of the significant tracks .",
    "the primary vertex was initially measured with all tracks of the event , including a correlation between hemispheres .",
    "primary vertices were then reconstructed , one per hemisphere .",
    "finally lifetime tag was used in conjunction with other tags ; variables are combined in multivariate analyses ( neural network for instance ) . with this kind of analyses ,",
    "a purity greater than 98 % with an efficiency greater than 30 % has been achieved by delphi  @xcite .",
    "measurements are summarised in table [ tabrb ] .",
    "the combined result  @xcite , @xmath31 = 0.21732 @xmath32 0.00087 , corresponds to a precision @xmath33 .",
    "the statistical and systematic errors are comparable , the latter receiving contributions mainly from uncertainties in gluon splitting @xmath34 and @xmath35 , from the tracking resolution of the detector , and from hemisphere correlations .",
    ".summary of @xmath18 results .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ , > , < \" , ]     [ tabvcb ]    the decay @xmath36 can also be used to measure @xmath2 in a similar manner .",
    "here there are fewer experimental results , as it is a more challenging mode , and only aleph  @xcite and cleo  @xcite have used this channel ( see table  [ tabvcb ] ) .",
    "combining their results gives @xmath2 = ( 39.4 @xmath32 5.0 ) 10@xmath37  @xcite .",
    "the experimental values for the intercept and the slope are combined with careful attention to the correlated errors .",
    "the excellent agreement between a wide variety of methods for extracting @xmath38 is encouraging .",
    "the world average of all @xmath38 measurements leads to @xmath2 = ( 39.5 @xmath32 1.7 ) 10@xmath37 .",
    "improvements from theoretical and experimental sides are promising .",
    "@xmath3 can be extracted in a same way as @xmath2 by looking to @xmath39 transitions instead of @xmath40 transitions .",
    "the inclusive and exclusive approaches can also be used . due to the fact that a @xmath0 decay is dominated by the process where the @xmath0 quark turns into a @xmath41 quark , the experimental determinations of @xmath3 are very much difficult than those of @xmath2 .",
    "it is also more difficult from the theoretical point of vue because the @xmath42 quark in the final state is no longer heavy .",
    "the first observations for @xmath39 transitions were done at the @xmath43 were @xmath44 mesons are produced at rest  @xcite .",
    "these analyses have looked at the endpoint of the single lepton spectrum for leptons from @xmath44 decay that are kinematically incompatible with coming from the decay of a @xmath44 meson to charm meson . from the lepton excess in this corner of phase space ,",
    "theoretical models are used to extrapolate the full lepton spectrum and @xmath3 = ( 3.1 @xmath32 0.8)@xmath45 is extracted by cleo  @xcite .",
    "model uncertainties dominate the error .",
    "aleph has published the first evidence for semileptonic @xmath39 transitions in @xmath0 hadrons produced at lep  @xcite .",
    "aleph has inclusively reconstructed the hadronic system accompagning the lepton in the semileptonic b decays and has built a set of kinematic variables to discriminate between @xmath46 and @xmath47 transitions by taking advantage of the different shape properties of these final states .",
    "a neural network was used to extract the inclusive @xmath48 branching ratio .",
    "they have measured @xmath48 = ( 1.73 @xmath32 0.55 @xmath32 0.55 ) 10@xmath37 .",
    "an advantage of this analysis is that it integrates over the entire lepton and hadron spectrum for these decays , potentially reducing the model dependence of the result .",
    "a disadvantage is that it has to manage with the large background from @xmath40 semileptonic decays which needs to be well understood .    the same kind of calculations than for @xmath2",
    "have been done to extract @xmath3 from @xmath48  @xcite @xmath49 the resulting value of @xmath3 is ( 4.16 @xmath32 1.02 ) 10@xmath37 .",
    "@xmath3 has also been extracted from the exclusive decays @xmath50 and @xmath51 at cleo  @xcite .",
    "the value is @xmath3 = ( 3.3 @xmath32 0.2 @xmath32 0.4 @xmath32 0.7 ) 10@xmath37 , where the errors are statistical , experimental systematic , and theoretical model dependence respectively .",
    "all these @xmath3 extractions are model dependent , however in different ways .",
    "the consistency of the results is thus comforting .",
    "the world average is then @xmath3 = ( 3.4 @xmath32 0.5 ) 10@xmath37",
    "@xmath0 physics is a place of intensive work .",
    "the @xmath52 colliders and tevatron have provided a large amount of data on the production and decay of beauty particles . in recent years",
    "the experiments at lep , slc and cesr have turned the studies on the @xmath0 quark into precision physics .",
    "numerous interesting new results have been provided and a lot of measurements have been performed . among these results :    * in the electroweak sector , @xmath18 has been measured , @xmath53 = 0.2173 @xmath32 0.0009 , to an accuracy of @xmath54 , the forward backward charge asymmetry @xmath55 = 0.0998 @xmath32 0.0022 leads to a measurement of @xmath56= 0.23213 @xmath32 0.00039 with an accuracy of @xmath57 .",
    "one of the most precise determination of this quantity . * in bottom spectroscopy",
    ", the @xmath9 meson has been discovered by cdf at tevatron . *",
    "the @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath0-baryon lifetimes , and their ratio with the @xmath61 lifetime , have been measured with a good precision ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the hierarchy among @xmath0 hadron lifetimes agrees with theoretical predictions .",
    "but for the @xmath0 baryon lifetime , predictions are higher than measurements by @xmath63 .",
    "the semileptonic @xmath0 baryon branching ratio confirms this puzzle ... * the -  oscillation frequency , @xmath64 , is also measured with similar accuracy ( @xmath65 ) ; but the hadronic uncertainty limits the extracted value of @xmath66 to an accuracy of @xmath67 .",
    "+ the -  oscillation is still not seen and a limit @xmath68 at 95% cl has been set .",
    "nevertheless non negligible constraints on the ckm matrix with @xmath69 at 95% cl is provided . *",
    "@xmath0 semileptonic decays have been scrutinized intensively .",
    "if the situation between @xmath26 measurements at @xmath43 and z energies is still to be clarified , the agreement being of the order of 2@xmath28 , these low @xmath26 values agree with theoretical expectations which favour high values of the number of charm quark per @xmath0 decay , as experimentally measured . a significant contribution of decays in @xmath70 transition , without @xmath71 is observed .",
    "no hints for new physics is found in @xmath0 decays . *",
    "the ckm matrix element @xmath2 = ( 39.5 @xmath32 1.7 ) 10@xmath37 has been measured to an accuracy of @xmath65 .",
    "values of @xmath2 show good agreement in results obtained from inclusive and exclusive studies .",
    "@xmath3 = ( 3.4@xmath32 0.5 ) 10@xmath37 has also been measured but to an accuracy of @xmath72 as it is a lot more challenging .",
    "limitations are due to models .",
    "the accuracy of present data provides important tests of the sm and guides the developements of the understanding of the rich phenomenology of weak @xmath0 decays .",
    "no more substantial running at the z pole is foreseen at lep and the final analyses with optimised algorithms , or new analysis ideas , are being prepared .",
    "lep has shown its capability for studying @xmath0 physics .",
    "the large amount of data , highly efficient detectors , and good particle identification have allowed a wide range of @xmath0 physics to be explored .",
    "the z pole is very competitive to study @xmath0 physics .",
    "slc is still running and can beneficts for the polarization and excellent resolution of their vertex detector to provide interesting results .",
    "cesr will continue to improve its luminosity and cleo has upgraded the detector and will continue to play a significant role in @xmath44 physics .",
    "the experiments at the @xmath52 colliders have also prepared important engineering data and developed analysis techniques that will be further exploited in the continuation of beauty physics at the next generation of @xmath0 facilities .",
