    "the presence of intra - dimer dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions in srcub@xmath2(bo@xmath4)@xmath9 however calls for a more complex scenario than a direct interpretation in terms of supersolidity of triplet excitations in this regime  @xcite .    as another realization of the shastry - sutherland geometry the rare earth tetraborid tmb@xmath18  @xcite",

    "numerical studies have become especially important as an unbiased approach to quantum magnetism .",
    "however , numerical studies of even simple models of frustrated spin systems suffer from severe restrictions on the finite sizes accessible to current simulation techniques .",
    "in particular , quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations are tampered by a notorious sign - problem  @xcite due to odd - length spin - exchange paths appearing on non - bipartite lattices .",
    "this usually restricts unbiased numerical studies to the small lattices accessible to exact numerical diagonalization .",
    "noteworthy in this respect are however recent studies employing the density matrix renormalization group algorithm on the triangular and kagome lattice heisenberg model  @xcite .    here , we employ a different approach in order to explore the interplay between quantum fluctuations and frustration , by studying a model of quantum magnetism in a parameter regime , where geometric frustration is restricted to the classical sector , and does not lead to qmc sign problems .",

    "motivated by the above mentioned studies on these frustrated geometries , we here assess the effects of quantum fluctuations on the classical degenerate ground states on the shastry - sutherland lattice , and explore the phase diagram of the full quantum model .",

    "we study the quantum phase transitions between these different phases , and consider the effects of a magnetic field .",
    "we do not obtain indications for supersolidity in this model , but find that quantum effects lead to the stabilization of a magnetization plateau at 1/2 of the full saturation , that does not persist down to the ising limit .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of e.g. the triangular and kagome lattice , where all plateaus found in the quantum regime persist down to the ising limit , where they have a largest extension .",

    "2 ( a ) remain to span the low - energy sector . the configurations of fig .",
    "2 ( b ) are split - off by a finite energy difference @xmath134 from the ground state manifold .",
    "since this energy difference remains positive for @xmath135 we expect that as long as @xmath136 close to @xmath133 , the system is driven by quantum effects towards the same phase as for @xmath33 .",
    "in fact , this expectation is in agreement with the qmc phase diagram of fig .",
    "3 , where we found that ( i ) for small @xmath21 at @xmath30 , the system enters the dimer triplet state as it does for @xmath33 , and ( ii ) the phase boundary of the dimer triplet phase closely follows the limiting line @xmath137 according to @xmath138 for small @xmath45 ( compare to the dashed - dotted line in fig .",
    "the above argument was based on energy considerations on an isolated dimer . due to this restriction",
    ", we are not able here to discern , if the superfluid phase indeed terminates at a small , but finite values of @xmath45 , or if it persists down to any finite value of @xmath21 .",
    "this would require the intra - dimer exchanges to be taken into account within higher orders of perturbation theory .",
    "however , from our analysis of the case @xmath33 discussed above , we expect that also in this case , the effective model will not allow for an explicit solution , thus leaving this question unanswered .",
    "hence , here we do not attempt to extend on this issue , but instead move on to study the magnetization process in the model under consideration .",
    "after exploring the ground state phase diagram , we now consider the model of eq .",
    "( 1 ) in the presence of a finite magnetic field @xmath139 , which couples to the spins by the standard zeeman term , @xmath140 from considering a singly flipped spin with respect to the fully polarized state , one finds that the system is fully polarized for magnetic fields @xmath139 beyond @xmath141    before discussing the magnetization process of the full quantum model , it is again useful to consider first the ising limit .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "state that the ising model on the shastry - sutherland lattice exhibits a magnetization process with a single plateau at @xmath142 , where @xmath143 denotes the magnetization , and @xmath144 its saturation value , at least for @xmath145 . in our notation",
    ", this @xmath1 plateau should extend between @xmath146 .",
    "in particular , in case @xmath147 , well within the nel ordered zero - field regime , this range becomes @xmath148 .",
    "this conclusion in ref .   was based on analyzing a finite system with 16 spins only . in order to check this conclusion on larger system sizes",
    ", we performed a systematic finite size analysis , using classical monte carlo ( mc ) simulations on lattices with up to @xmath149 spins in the canonical ensemble . for these simulations",
    ", we employed a single spin - flip metropolis algorithm , and allowed for a simulated annealing of the system from a large initial temperature @xmath150 down to the final temperature during an initial state of equilibration .",
    "this way we were able to obtain mc results down to @xmath151 for @xmath152 , and @xmath153 for @xmath154 . while for the purpose of the current study , one can draw relevant conclusions on the magnetization process from these data , it will be interesting to obtain more refined numerical data on the magnetization process in the ising limit , using extended ensemble sampling methods , similar to the approach taken in ref .   for the square and triangular lattice",
    ". however , this lies beyond the scope of the current study , which is directed towards the quantum regime .    upon presenting the mc results",
    ", we first discuss the case @xmath147 considered in ref .  .",
    "our mc data for the magnetization process on different lattices are collected in fig .",
    "[ fig : magisinga ] . the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : magisinga ] shows our data for a @xmath155 system , which appear to confirm the conclusion of ref .  .",
    "however , upon increasing the system size , we find that different plateau structures appear .",
    "in general , in order to allow a system to establish a certain magnetization plateau , appropriate lattice sizes and boundary conditions must to be chosen . otherwise , geometric constraints could frustrate certain magnetization patterns . in the present case",
    ", it can be seen from the numerical data , that only for @xmath43 a multiple of 3 , the system establishes a wide @xmath156 plateau , which is consistently observed for @xmath157 and @xmath158 . instead",
    ", the @xmath159 and @xmath160 systems can not establish the corresponding magnetic superstructure , and hence lead to rather different magnetization curves with strong finite size effects , that do not represent thermodynamic limit behavior .",
    "the magnetization curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : magisinga ] for @xmath161 , taken at @xmath151 , exhibits a magnetization plateau at @xmath156 , extending from @xmath162 up to the saturation field at @xmath163 .",
    "the data shown for the two larger systems , for which higher temperatures had to be taken in the mc simulations , are consistent with a thermal smothering of the magnetization jumps out of the plateau towards @xmath164 and full saturation , respectively .",
    "we conclude that for @xmath147 the ising model exhibits a single intermediate magnetization plateau at @xmath156 , extending from @xmath162 up to the saturation field at @xmath163 .",
    "the different conclusion of ref .   appears to be due to the usage of inappropriate finite lattice sizes .",
    "note , that all values of @xmath43 considered here were even , i.e. a plateau at @xmath142 , if it would exist in this model , would not be frustrated by finite lattice effects . in fact , as discussed below , we find that such a @xmath1 plateau appears for finite values of @xmath45 due to quantum effects .",
    "next , we consider the case @xmath165 , well inside the degenerate region of @xmath33 .",
    "below , we will compare the ising model result to qmc data on the magnetization process for finite @xmath21 at the same value of @xmath58 .",
    "the mc results for the magnetization process in the ising limit are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : magisingb ] , where we now consider linear system sizes @xmath43 that are a multiple of @xmath166 .",
    "again , we observe a wide @xmath0 magnetization plateau , which extends from @xmath167 up to the saturation field at @xmath168 .",
    "a precise estimate of the lower boundary of the plateau is not accessible from the current finite size data , as we could not collect data at sufficiently low temperatures on larger systems .",
    "there appears however a finite magnetization with a smooth increase well before the plateau is entered .",
    "it will be interesting to explore this low@xmath169 regime in more detail using extended ensemble methods .",
    "the point that is important for the following discussion , and which follows also from the current mc data , is the absence again of a magnetization plateau at @xmath142 .",
    "instead , the magnetization exhibits a jump from the @xmath0 plateau up to magnetic saturation at @xmath170 .    as we show next , a plateau at @xmath142 , while not obtained in the ising limit , emerges in the quantum model at finite values of @xmath21 .",
    "[ fig : magquantum ] shows the magnetization process for @xmath165 and @xmath171 from qmc simulations .",
    "we again find a magnetization plateau at @xmath156 as well as a plateau at @xmath142 . adding a transverse exchange to the ising model thus leads to a softening of the large magnetization jump from @xmath156 to @xmath172 in the ising limit , and an additional plateau region appears with @xmath142 .",
    "in hard - core bosonic language , the transverse exchange maps onto a non - frustrating hopping amplitude . in the current situation , this finite boson hopping does not lead always to superfluidity , but drives the system into an insulating phase at filling @xmath173 , corresponding to @xmath142 ( due to particle - hole symmetry , a similar insulating region emerges also for @xmath174 , corresponding to @xmath175 ) .",
    "indeed , we find from fig .",
    "[ fig : magquantum ] , that the spin stiffness @xmath176 vanishes inside both plateau regions .",
    "it is then in order to study , if the magnetic excitations in both plateau phases form period crystals , and what the structures of such solid arrays would be .",
    "long - range crystalline ordering of magnetic excitations inside magnetic plateau regions has previously been analyzed for the isotropic spin-1/2 heisenberg model on the shastry - sutherland model  @xcite , based on different approximative schemes .",
    "the relevant structures expected from these studies are shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : magsuperstructures ] for the @xmath0 ( upper panel ) , and the @xmath1 ( lower panel ) plateau , respectively .",
    "they are expressed in terms of periodic arrangements of @xmath177 dimer triplet states @xmath106 , denoted by dumbbells , in a background of less polarized , e.g. @xmath65 states on the remaining dimers .",
    "we now assess , if these crystalline patterns appear also in the current quantum model , which represents an anisotropic version of the heisenberg model considered thus far .    in a qmc simulation",
    ", one can probe exactly for these magnetic superstructures by measuring an appropriate structure factor .",
    "hence , we analyze the ordering pattern of the magnetic excitations by measuring the triplet excitation structure factor @xmath178 where @xmath179 is a projector on the @xmath177 dimer triplet state @xmath106 on dimer @xmath101 .",
    "@xmath180 equals the number of dimers in the finite system of @xmath35 sites .",
    "the positions @xmath181 of the dimers and the momentum space vector @xmath182 are defined with respect to the convenient coordinate system formed by the square lattice of dimers , with the distance between the centers of two neighboring dimers taken as unity . in this way ,",
    "the solid order shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : magsuperstructures ] for @xmath156 corresponds to a peak in @xmath183 at @xmath184 , and at @xmath185 for the order shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : magsuperstructures ] for @xmath142 .",
    "the main panels of fig .  [ fig : magsuperstructures ] show these components of the structure factor for different system sizes , respectively .",
    "we checked , that no other signal in @xmath186 appeared , apart from those explicitly shown . from these data",
    "we conclude , that indeed the crystalline orders of the magnetic excitations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : magsuperstructures ] are stabilized within the two magnetization plateau regions , respectively . in order to study the real - space distribution of the magnetization among the lattice sites in more detail",
    ", we also measured the mean local values of the magnetization .",
    "the obtained distributions of the local magnetization are shown for the 1/3 and 1/2 plateau in fig .",
    "[ fig : realspace ] ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "they agree well with the distributions reported for the isotropic heisenberg model in the studies mentioned above .    upon varying @xmath139 beyond these wide magnetization plateaus ,",
    "the magnetization undergoes discontinuous jumps , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : magquantum ] , alert when entering the @xmath1 plateau from below , where such a jump appears not that well resolved .",
    "the spin stiffness @xmath176 exhibits a similar behavior , with clear jumps upon entering the plateaus , expect when entering the @xmath1 plateau from below .",
    "apart from this case , the superfluid - insulator transitions are thus clearly first order . concerning the region below the @xmath1 plateau",
    ", one might instead consider the presence of a supersolid state of magnetic excitations , with both a finite superfluid density and a crystalline superstructure . in order to assess ,",
    "if supersolid behavior is indeed present in this regime , we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : supersolid ] the finite size scaling of both the superfluid density @xmath176 and the relevant structure factors from the neighboring magnetization plateaus at a magnetic field of @xmath187 , inside the possibly supersolid region . from the finite size",
    "scaling we can exclude the presence of a supersolid phase in this parameter regime . between the two magnetization plateaus , the system is thus in a uniform superfluid state .",
    "our analysis of the magnetization process at @xmath188 and @xmath171 did not exhibit the presence of any additional plateaus at lower values of @xmath143 .",
    "indeed , at low-@xmath143 the magnetization curve as well as the superfluid density appear smooth in fig .",
    "[ fig : magquantum ] . in particular , we did not find any of the fractional magnetization plateaus mentioned in sec .",
    "i for the compounds srcub@xmath2(bo@xmath4)@xmath9 and tmb@xmath18 , nor those found for the isotropic spin-1/2 heisenberg model on the shastry - sutherland model in recent studies  @xcite .",
    "we postpone a discuss on this issue to the concluding section .    finally , we present our results for the magnetization process upon varying over a wider range of parameters space",
    ". the results of qmc simulations similar to those discussed in detail above are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : emergence ] , which shows the magnetic phase diagram for a generic fixed ratio of @xmath188 .",
    "the figure shows both the @xmath156 magnetization lobe that extends from the ising limit up to @xmath189 , as well as the emergent @xmath142 lobe , that extends up to a similar value of @xmath45 , but shrinks upon approaching the ising limit , where no @xmath1 plateau persists .",
    "we studied the ground state phase diagram and the magnetization process of the spin-1/2 easy - axis xxz model of eq .",
    "( 1 ) with ferromagnetic transverse spin exchange on the shastry - sutherland lattice .",
    "the model exhibits a nel ordered phase for small values of @xmath58 and @xmath45 , and a superfluid phase for dominant @xmath45 . for sufficiently large values of @xmath58 , a dimerized phase with the dominant formation of @xmath190 triplet states on the @xmath31-dimer bonds is stabilized , that connects to the degenerate phase of the model in the ising limit .",
    "we like to compare this findings to the case of the isotropic heisenberg model on the same lattice .",
    "also in this model there is strong evidence for an intermediate phase  @xcite , separating the nel ordered phase from the dimer singlet phase .",
    "in contrast , this intermediate phase is however not a superfluid , but appears to be realize a valence bond crystal driven by the frustrated nature of the transverse exchange interactions in this region  @xcite .",
    "using classical monte carlo simulations to assess the magnetization process in the ising limit , we found in contrast to previous claims  @xcite no magnetization plateau at @xmath1 of full saturation , but instead a @xmath0 plateau , with a jump towards full saturation .",
    "the quantum model shows the presence of a @xmath1 plateau in addition to the @xmath0 plateau .",
    "this emergence of a magnetization plateau upon adding quantum fluctuations ( via a finite @xmath45 ) to the ising model remains of the previously observed emergence of a magnetization plateau via thermal fluctuations in the classical heisenberg model on the kagome lattice  @xcite .",
    "while we examined the case of a ferromagnetic transverse spin exchange , the experimental observation of a @xmath1 plateau in the compounds tmb@xmath18 and srcub@xmath2(bo@xmath4)@xmath9 can be taken as indication , that such a plateau also emerges for antiferromagnetic transverse exchange .",
    "indeed , a @xmath1 plateau is consistently reported also in the studies on the magnetization process of the isotropic heisenberg model on the shastry - sutherland lattice  @xcite .",
    "with respect to other reported magnetization plateaus both from experiments and in recent theoretical work , we did not obtain evidence from our quantum monte carlo simulations , that they are stabilized in the current model .",
    "in particular , the pronounced @xmath11 plateau , consistently reported in recent theoretical work  @xcite , has not been found for the parameter region we examined in our simulations ( we performed various scans inside the range @xmath191 , down to @xmath192 , with results similar to those presented in detail above ) , even though the proposed magnetic unit cell  @xcite is commensurate with the finite lattices that we employed in our simulations .",
    "we explicitly checked that no signal in the relevant component of @xmath186 at @xmath193 appears near @xmath194 in this model .",
    "hence , we conclude that the model considered here exhibits magnetization plateaus at @xmath1 and @xmath0 of the full saturation , only .",
    "future work could explore in more detail the magnetization process in the ising model inside the low - field region using extended ensemble methods , similar to the approach taken in ref .",
