    "for the case of the flat spacetime , the phenomenon of self - interaction for electric charges has been thoroughly elaborated and described in detail ( see , e.g. , textbooks @xcite ) . based on the symmetry properties of the minkowski spacetime it is evident to see that the self - force acting on a charge @xmath0 both at rest , and in uniform motion , has to be equal to zero .",
    "a nontrivial result can appear , only when a particle moves nonuniformly . in this case",
    ", the self - force @xmath1 is defined by the well - known abraham - lorentz - dirac formula @xmath2 in curved spacetimes and/or in spacetimes with a nontrivial topological structure the situation becomes more sophisticated and therefore more interesting , since even for a static electric charge the self - force can be nonvanishing ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    as it is well - known , the derivation of the expression for the self - force in the maxwell electrodynamics inseparably linked with some kind of regularization procedure for the energy of interaction between a charge and its electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "however , if we will use a suitable modification of the maxwell theory , the problem with divergences and renormalization can be eliminated . among these generalizations",
    "one can mark out two the most famous : the born - infeld model @xcite and the bopp - podolsky model @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the born - infeld model ( behavior of the fields near the worldline and the self - force problem were discussed in @xcite ) , which is nonlinear one , the second model suggested by fritz bopp and boris podolsky inherits linearity , but contains an additional high - derivative term @xmath3 ( a factor @xmath4 is a parameter of the model with the dimensionality of area ) .    in the framework of the bopp - podolsky ( or bp for short ) electrodynamics , the potential of resting point charge and",
    "its field energy appear to be _ finite _ , at least in the minkowski spacetime @xcite .",
    "moreover , as it was proved in @xcite , even if the charge moves , there is a wide class of worldlines in the flat space for which the potential is finite ( the case of uniformly accelerated motion was earlier discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "this remarkable feature of the bp model permits us to believe that the self - interaction energy expression will be regular for the static point charge in curved spacetimes as well . in order to state this assumption , in the present paper we consider two specific examples of non - minkowski spacetime , which admit the derivation of the energy formula by direct calculation .",
    "both of these spacetimes possess topological defects .",
    "the first example is the static axially symmetric spacetime of a straight cosmic string @xcite .",
    "the second spacetime has the spherical symmetry and corresponds to a global gravitating monopole @xcite . for both configurations ,",
    "the self - interaction energy will be found explicitly and its behavior with depending on the distance and the bp model parameter @xmath5 will be studied in detail . in addition , we will demonstrate explicitly that all obtained expressions are regular and a renormalization procedure is not required .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ bpformalism ] , we briefly formulate a general formalism of the bopp - podolsky electrodynamics and derive basic formulas for the self - interaction energy in the static case . in sect .",
    "[ axial ] and [ spherical ] , we obtain expressions for the energy when a charge is at rest in the cosmic string spacetime and the global monopole spacetime , respectively .",
    "[ conclusion ] is for conclusion .",
    "the formalism of bp electrodynamics starts from the lagrangian @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the electromagnetic field potential , @xmath8 is the maxwell tensor , @xmath9 denotes the covariant derivative , and @xmath10 is the current density . the variation procedure with respect to the potentials @xmath7 gives the electromagnetic field equation @xmath11 it is easy to see the bp lagrangian ( [ action ] ) and the bp equation ( [ meq ] ) reduce to the standard maxwellian form when @xmath12 .",
    "solutions of the fourth - order equations ( [ meq ] ) can be written as a difference between @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( see  @xcite ) @xmath15 where the first term is a solution to the maxwell equation , while the second one obeys the proca equation with the same current density @xmath16 thus , eq .",
    "( [ meq ] ) splits into two second - order equations describing , correspondingly , massless and massive ( with the mass @xmath5 ) vector fields . in this sense",
    ", the bp model has a close relationship with the pauli - villars regularization procedure ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and lee - wick model @xcite ( see also the recent papers @xcite ) .",
    "the electromagnetic field energy - momentum tensor derived by the variation with respect to metric from the action with the lagrangian ( [ action ] ) of this model takes the form @xmath17 when the potential @xmath7 satisfies the bp model equation ( [ meq ] ) , the energy - momentum tensor is also splitting into two parts : @xmath18 , where the first one @xmath19 corresponds to the massless vector field @xmath13 , and the second one @xmath20\\biggr),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the energy - momentum tensor of the proca - type massive field @xmath14 .",
    "this field has a negative energy and therefore it can be interpreted as a _ phantom _ one .",
    "when the particle is at rest , its current density is @xmath21 where @xmath0 is a charge of the particle , @xmath22 is the dirac delta function , @xmath23 denotes a radius - vector of a charge position , and the field potential in the framework of the bp electrodynamics @xcite takes the form @xmath24 for @xmath25 this formula turns into the well - known expression for the coulomb electrostatic potential , but at the origin it has no singularity , @xmath26 .",
    "the energy of the electrostatic field ( [ statpoten ] ) in the bp model is also finite and expressed by the formula @xmath27      since in the bp model the expression of the point charge field potential is free from a singularity at the origin , in order to derive a formula for the self - force @xmath28 , we could write down directly @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the maxwell tensor of the electromagnetic field produced by the moving particle , and @xmath31 is its velocity vector , and both quantities have to be calculated at the present position of the charged particle .",
    "however , for the static field potential ( [ statpoten ] ) in the minkowski spacetime , when @xmath32 we have @xmath33 it is easy to see that the strength tensor field ( [ hedge ] ) has a hedgehog - like singularity at the point of charge .",
    "therefore , in order to calculate the force acting on the charge we should average the expression ( [ hedge ] ) over solid angle .",
    "after this procedure we come to the predictable result : for the static charge in the minkowski spacetime @xmath34 .",
    "so , when we will use the formula ( [ selfforcedef ] ) , mentioned procedure of averaging should be always implied .",
    "on the other hand , the expression ( [ selfforcedef ] ) can be rewritten in the static case ( @xmath35 ) as follows @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the three - dimensional green functions for the equations ( [ meq2 ] ) and ( [ peq ] ) , respectively . since , due to the reciprocity principle , the green functions are symmetric with respect to permutation of their arguments @xmath39 the formula ( [ selfforce2 ] ) can be transformed into @xmath40 where the quantity @xmath41 plays the role of the self - interaction potential energy .",
    "mention that calculation of the self - interaction energy for the static point charge in the minkowski spacetime ( @xmath42 ) yields @xmath43 and therefore @xmath44 .",
    "it means that the second approach implies the averaging procedure automatically .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , let us consider a static axially symmetric spacetime , the metric of which takes the form @xmath45 here @xmath46 is a radial coordinate , @xmath47 $ ] is an azimuthal angle , and @xmath48 is a unique unknown function , which will be defined later .",
