    "the construction of prior distributions has always been a central aspect of bayesian analysis , arguably _ the _ central piece since all aspects of bayesian inference are automatically derived from defining the model , the prior , the data and the loss function @xcite . while the prior is a mathematical object , there is not rigorous derivation of a given prior distribution from the available information or lack thereof and , while  objective bayes \" constructions are automated to some extent @xcite , they are rejected by subjectivist bayesians who argue in favour of personalistic and non - reproducible prior selection @xcite . defining priors via moment conditions can be traced at least back to @xcite and the notion of _ maximum entropy priors _ , even though the moment conditions only involve the parameters @xmath0 of the model .",
    "the current paper considers instead moment conditions as defined jointly on the pair @xmath1 and proposes some necessary conditions for a prior distribution to be compatible with those conditions . from a foundational perspective , a setting where the joint distribution of the data and the parameter that drives this data is a given is hard to fathom , because it implies there is no longer a fixed parameter to infer about .",
    "in addition , the term  exogeneity \" used in the paper hints at a notion of the parameter being not truly a parameter , but including rather latent variables and maybe random effects .",
    "it is hard to reconcile this motivation with a computational one ( also found in the paper ) where complex likelihoods would justify calling for a prior as a practical tool .",
    "the additional reformulation of a ( pseudo-)likelihood function defined by the method of moments ( section 2 ) makes the focus of the paper difficult to specify and hence analyse .    given the introduction through fisher s ( 1930 ) fiducial distribution",
    ", one may wonder whether or not the author s approach is to integrate fiducial constructs within the bayesian paradigm or at the very least to specify under which conditions this can be achieved . as a long - time sceptic on the relevance of fiducial arguments , i doubt about one s ability to produce an arbitrary distribution on an equally arbitrary transform of the pair @xmath1 , instead of a genuine prior @xmath2 likelihood construct .",
    "for instance , the discussion around the various meanings of the @xmath3 statistic @xmath4 does not imply that it can achieve a @xmath3 posterior distribution with @xmath5 degrees of freedom _ jointly _ for all sample sizes @xmath6 and i doubt it can happen outside exotic cases like dirac masses on one of the terms .",
    "( exchanging the randomness of terms in a random variable as if it were a linear equation is a guaranteed way to produce fiducial paradoxes and measure theoretic difficulties . )",
    "this set of comments on @xcite is organised as follows : in section [ sec : moma ] , i analyse various and somewhat mutually exclusive aspects of the author s approach , while in section [ sec : compadre ] , i discuss some computational consequences and alternatives .",
    "gallant ( 2015 ) considers the distribution of a pivotal quantity like @xmath7 as induced by the hypothetical joint distribution on @xmath1 , hence conversely inducing constraints on this joint , as well as an associated conditional .",
    "( the constraints may be such that the joint distribution does not exist . ) however , this perspective is abandoned a few lines below to define a moment likelihood @xmath8^{-1 } \\bar{m}(x , \\theta ) \\right\\}\\ ] ] as a quasi - gaussian pseudo - likelihood in the moment @xmath9 .",
    "this is only one among many ways of defining a likelihood from moments , but it further removes the symmetry in @xmath10 and @xmath0 induced by the original formulation . in addition , one may wonder why a determinant like @xmath11 or at least a normalising constant ( obviously depending on @xmath0 ) does not appear in the pseudo - likelihood , since this impacts the resulting posterior density .",
    "a connected reference is zellner s ( 1997 ) _ bayesian method of moments _ where , given moment conditions on the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 = \\bar{x}_n\\ , , \\quad \\mathbb{e}[\\sigma^2|x_1,\\ldots ] = s^2_n\\ , , \\quad \\text{var}(\\theta|\\sigma^2,x_1,\\ldots ) = \\nicefrac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\,,\\ ] ] @xcite derives a _ maximum entropy _",
    "posterior @xmath14 later shown to be incompatible with the corresponding predictive distribution , besides producing an inconsistent estimator of @xmath12 @xcite .. @xcite designates the maxent principle _ per se _ as the culprit for this incoherence . ]",

    "hence , rather than building the minimal borel @xmath26-algebra on @xmath27 compatible with this joint on @xmath15 , i would suggest examining the range of prior@xmath2likelihood pairs that agree with this partial property when using the regular borel @xmath26-algebra .    the general solution found in section 3.5 (  the abstraction \" ) relies on the assumptions that @xmath28 is a surjective function for all @xmath0 s and on the axiom of choice , namely that an antecedent of the function can be selected for each @xmath29 , namely , @xmath30 such that @xmath31 . under these assumptions , @xmath32 and @xmath33",

    "the true ( scientific ) model parametrised by @xmath0 is replaced with a ( statistical ) substitute that is available in closed form and parametrised by @xmath40 . which states that the intractable density is equal to a closed - form density . ]",
    "this latter model is over - parametrised when compared with the scientific model .",
    "take , e.g. , a @xmath41 scientific model versus a @xmath42 statistical model .",
    "in addition , the prior information is only available on the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "however , this does not seem to matter very much since ( a ) the bayesian analysis is operated on @xmath0 only and ( b ) the metropolis approach adopted by the authors involves simulating a massive number of pseudo - observations , given the current value of the parameter @xmath0 and the scientific model , so that the transform @xmath40 can be estimated by maximum likelihood over the statistical model .",
    "the paper suggests using a secondary markov chain algorithm to find this mle .",
    "the pseudo - model is then used in a primary mcmc step .",
    "hence , the approach of @xcite is not truly an abc algorithm . in the same setting , abc would indeed use one simulated dataset , with the same size as the observed dataset , compute the mles for both and compare them ( as in @xcite ) .",
    "this approach is faster if less accurate when assumption 1that the statistical model holds for a restricted parametrisation  does not stand .",
    "one overall interrogation about this paper is the validation of the outcome .",
    "as noted in @xcite , bayesian posterior distributions are not naturally endowed with an epistemic validity .",
    "the same questioning obviously applies to entities defined outside the bayesian paradigm , the present one included , in that producing a posterior or pseudo - posterior distribution on the parameter offers no guarantee _ per se _ about the efficiency of the inference it produces .",
    "using asymptotically convergent approximations to the likelihood function does not always lead to consistent bayesian approximations @xcite and thus requires further validation of the procedures proposed here .    another global interrogation that remains open",
    "is the validation of the income outside of the bayesian paradigm .",
    "the production of the equation has to occur as a byproduct of defining a joint probability model on the space @xmath27 , which seems to logically exclude both non - bayesian perspectives and _ ex nihilo _ occurrences of moment conditions .",
    "the only statistics example worked out in the paper , namely habit persistence asset pricing , starts with a given prior distribution ( 31 ) , which makes this example irrelevant for the stated goal of checking whether or not  the assertion of a distribution for moment functions either partially or completely specifies the prior \" .    despite these difficulties in apprehending the paper postulate",
    ", i would like to conclude with a more positive perspective , namely that the problematic of partially defining models and priors via moment conditions is of considerable interest in an era of big data , small worlds @xcite , and limited information .",
    "acknowledging that inference and in particular bayesian inference can not always handle big worlds ( see , e.g. , the paradox exposed in @xcite ) and constructing coherent and efficient tools for restricted inference about some aspects of the model are very current questions that beg addressing in full generality .",
    "i am quite grateful to robert kohn ( unsw ) and mark steel ( university of warwick ) for helpful comments and references .",
