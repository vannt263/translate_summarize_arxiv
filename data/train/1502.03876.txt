    "topological phases of matter have bulk gap but gapless boundary states @xcite .",
    "these studies have been extended to interacting fermions and bosons .",
    "specially much progress has been made for one - dimensional ( 1d ) topological bosonic phases .",
    "classification schemes have been proposed for such phases @xcite .",
    "it is recognized that long - known 1d haldane phase for spin-1 chain is a topological bosonic phase @xcite .",
    "while these studies are important for our understanding of topological bosonic states , it is also highly desirable to study nontrivial bosonic phases in experimental accessible systems .",
    "motivated by the experimental progress in studying topological phases with ultracold atoms @xcite , exploring topologically nontrivial phases of interacting bosons in 1d superlattices has attracted intensive attentions .",
    "it is found that by simply replacing free fermions with interacting bosons in 1d topological superlattices @xcite , the resulting extended bose - hubbard models display nontrivial topological property @xcite , which are well understood from the hard - core limit .",
    "as the bose - hubbard model exhibits rich quantum phases due to multiple occupations of bosons on a single site @xcite , one may expect some novel phenomena emerging in topologically nontrivial superlattice systems beyond the hard - core limit . as we shall display in this work , surprisingly plentiful phase diagram , including the emergence of topological bosonic insulators at both fractional and integer fillings and various phase transitions induced by varying the chemical potential and the strength of superlattice potential ,",
    "are found in the simple superlattice system , which is realizable in cold - atom experiments @xcite .",
    "we firstly determine the complete phase diagram of the system by a combination of atomic - limit analysis and quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations .",
    "while the phase diagram in the atomic limit contains charge - density - wave ( cdw ) and mott insulating phases with various fillings , these insulating phases persist but are separated by superfluid phases when hopping terms are included .",
    "it is interesting that some nontrivial insulating phases emerge between two adjacent persisted insulators and these emergent insulators are topologically nontrivial , characterized by the berry phase @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "the persisted insulators are topologically trivial as they are adiabatically connected to the insulators in the atomic limit .",
    "the nontrivial topological property of the emergent insulators is further confirmed by the presence of a pair of degenerate in - gap boundary states under open boundary condition ( obc ) , which leads to the splitting of topological plateau in the @xmath2 curve . by varying the superlattice strength",
    ", one may observe phase transitions between the topologically different insulating phases .",
    "our results present a complete understanding on the topological phase diagram of interacting bosons in 1d superlattices , which may shed light on the experimental exploration of the predicted exotic topological phases and phase transitions .",
    "we consider the interacting bosons loaded into the optical superlattice with inversion symmetry in the grand canonical ensemble , whose basic physics is described by the extended bose - hubbard model with a superlattice potential : @xmath3 where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is the bosonic annihilation ( creation ) operator , @xmath6 is the number operator of bosons , the hopping amplitude @xmath7 is set to be the unit of the energy @xmath8 , @xmath9 represents a superlattice potential with the period @xmath10 , @xmath11 represents the strength of on - site interactions , and @xmath12 is the chemical potential .",
    "the inversion symmetry further requires @xmath13 with @xmath14 , which can be realized by a simple bichromatic superlattice potential @xmath15 by tuning the phase to @xmath16 or @xmath17 , with @xmath18 the strength of the potential @xcite . without loss of generality",
    ", we shall focus our study on the case with @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the following calculations .    in the hard - core limit @xmath21 , eq.([eq1 ] )",
    "can be mapped to the free fermionic model in the superlattice @xcite , which has been shown that 1d topological phases protected by inversion symmetry exist at inversion - symmetric point @xmath22 for fillings of @xmath23 , @xmath24 respectively @xcite .",
    "the 1d topological phase is characterized by the berry phase , @xmath25 , with the berry connection @xmath26 and @xmath27 the occupied bloch state @xcite . due to the protection of the inversion symmetry ,",
    "the berry phase @xmath28 mod @xmath29 takes two values : @xmath0 for a topological phase and @xmath30 for a trivial phase . corresponding to the nontrivial berry phase @xmath0",
    ", there appear a pair of degenerate in - gap states under obc , whose distributions are localized near the boundaries .",
    "it is useful to firstly consider the atomic limit @xmath31 . whether a boson can be added to the @xmath32th site with @xmath33 bosons is determined by the energy difference @xmath34 with @xmath35 the total energy of the bosons on the @xmath32th site . if @xmath36 , the total energy is lowered and one more boson can be added to the site .",
    "thus a series of lines determined by @xmath37 separate different insulating phases .",
    "the phase diagram of the atomic limit in the @xmath38 plane is shown in fig.[fig1](a ) .",
    "the set of parallel lines @xmath39 determine the occupation on the middle site of the unit cell and the separated regions have gradually increasing occupation numbers .",
    "the set of parallel lines @xmath40 determine the occupation on the side sites .",
    "there are two kinds of insulators in the phase diagram : mott insulator with a uniform density @xmath41 ( or @xmath42 ) with @xmath43 the number of bosons on the side ( middle ) sites of the unit cell ; cdw insulator with a density profile reflecting the modulation and an average density @xmath44 .",
    "different insulators are characterized by the values of structure factor @xmath45 . for the mott insulators ,",
    "the structure factor has one peak at @xmath46 with @xmath47 . in the cdw insulator",
    ", a peak develops at @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    ", when the middle ( side ) site of the unit cell has high ( low ) potential energy.,width=264 ]    next we turn on nearest - neighbor ( nn ) hoppings and the phase diagram obtained from qmc simulations is shown in fig.[fig1](b ) .",
    "compared to the atomic one , the phase diagram is considerably modified .",
    "although each insulator in the atomic limit persists , the phase boundaries are deformed and incommensurate superfluid regions appear between the commensurate insulating regions . moreover between two adjacent regions separated by the line @xmath40 , a insulator with intermediate filling @xmath50 emerges ( @xmath51 are the fillings of the two regions ) . except of the insulator with @xmath52",
    ", the emergent insulating regions are connected to the persisted ones with the same fillings , e.g. , the shaded regions in fig.[fig1](b ) with @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and are separated from others by superfluid phases .     along the cut with fixed @xmath55 in the phase diagram.,width=283 ]",
    "the above phase diagram is obtained by calculating the structure factor @xmath45 , @xmath56 and the superfluid density @xmath57 with @xmath58 the winding number and @xmath59 the inverse temperature @xcite .",
    "an insulator is characterized by @xmath60 and @xmath61 , while a superfluid phase by @xmath62 and @xmath63 . to see the details ,",
    "we present the numerical results on the cut with fixed @xmath55 in the phase diagram , along which all the typical insulating phases are met . as shown in fig.[fig2 ] , the average density @xmath64 exhibits various plateaus at commensurate fillings , on which the superfluid density @xmath65 vanishes .",
    "so the plateaus correspond to the imcompressive insulators , whose gaps are the widths of the plateaus . between the insulators , the average density increases continuously with the chemical potential and the superfluid density is finite , implying the system is in superfluid phase . among the insulators , those persisted",
    "mott and cdw insulators are distinguished by the values of the structure factors ( see the appendix ) .",
    "the topological property of the interacting bosonic insulators is characterized by the berry phase defined with the twisted boundary phase @xmath66 @xcite , @xmath67 where @xmath66 takes values from @xmath30 to @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the corresponding many - body ground - state wave - function . in fig.[fig3](a ) , we calculate the berry phase as a function of the strength of the superlattice potential @xmath18 at different fillings .",
    "the @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) insulators are in one piece of the phase diagram . for the @xmath70 insulators ,",
    "the berry phase is @xmath0 and they are topological .",
    "however for the @xmath71 insulators , the berry phase is @xmath30 , thus they are trivial .",
    "there are two pieces for the insulators with @xmath53 ( @xmath72 ) , which are connected at a critical point . for @xmath53 insulators ,",
    "the berry phase changes its value from @xmath30 to @xmath0 at the critical point , implying the @xmath53 insulators emerging at large @xmath18 are topological ones .",
    "however for @xmath73 insulators , the berry phase changes its value from @xmath0 to @xmath30 at the critical point , and the @xmath73 insulators emerging at small @xmath18 are topological ones .",
    "the topological property of insulators at other fillings can be analyzed similarly .",
    "so phase transitions between topologically different insulators can be realized by tuning the superlattice strength .",
    "moreover these results provide a complete understanding of the topological properties of the insulating phases exhibited by interacting bosons in 1d superlattices : all emergent insulators in the presence of nn hoppings are topological , while those persisted cdw or mott insulators are trivial since they are adiabatically connected to the atomic ones .     at several typical fillings .",

    "the inverse temperature of ( c ) is @xmath77 . in ( b ) and",
    "( c ) the parameter @xmath55 is used.,width=321 ]    due to the bulk - boundary correspondence , there should appear a pair of degenerate in - gap boundary states under obc in the topological phases .",
    "the plateau of the topological insulating phase in the @xmath2 curve should be altered : below the critical chemical potential corresponding to the energy of the in - gap states , none of the in - gap states are occupied and the average density changes to @xmath78 ; above the critical chemical potential , both of the in - gap states are occupied and the average density changes to @xmath79 .",
    "it is verified by our qmc simulations . as shown in fig.[fig3](b ) , the plateaus of the topological phases split into two pieces with a jump at the critical chemical potential and the magnitude of the jump is exactly @xmath80 .",
    "moreover the jump tends to be vertical in the limit of zero temperature , implying the two in - gap states are degenerate . to verify the in - gap states are boundary ones",
    ", we calculate the distribution of the bosons under obc on two representative points of the split plateaus . as shown in fig.[fig3 ] ( c ) , the distribution on the bulk sites are nearly unchanged , thus the filling of the in - gap states happens near the boundaries . when none of the in - gap states are filled ( the lower plateau ) , there is @xmath81- fractional boson less at each boundary compared to the bulk sites .",
    "however after both are filled ( the higher plateau ) , there is @xmath81- fractional boson more .",
    "the results for the topological phases with other fillings are similar . as a contrast",
    ", we do not observe the splitting of plateaus and boundary states for trivial insulators .",
    "thus our results give clear evidence that in the topological phases a pair of degenerate in - gap states appear and they are localized near the boundaries .",
    "the nature of the topological phases can be qualitatively understood from the aspect of their analog to the famous topological trimerized model @xcite , whose configuration is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( a ) .",
    "the main character of the model is that the bonds connecting different unit cells have larger hopping amplitude , while those inside a unit cell are equal and smaller . for the topological bosonic insulating phase at @xmath1 filling ,",
    "the bosons tend to reside on the sites in the minima of the superlattice and averagely there is one boson on two adjacent low energy sites [ see fig.[fig4 ] ( b ) ] .",
    "since the two sites are identical , the boson can hop freely between them with a larger amplitude to gain more kinetic energy .",
    "however the hoppings between other sites are barriered by the potentials and the amplitudes are relatively small .",
    "thus the effective hopping amplitudes form a configuration similar to that of the topological trimerized model and the system exhibits nontrivial topological property .",
    "the topological phase at higher filling @xmath64 is similar except that it has a background of cdw or mott insulator with @xmath82 , e.g. , the cases with the fillings @xmath83 shown in fig.[fig4 ] ( c ) , ( d ) . furthermore the qualitative picture is consistent with the values of the structure factor ( see the appendix ) .",
    "so we can term the topological phases with higher fillings as topological bosonic cdw or mott insulators depending on the background .    ; ( c ) @xmath53 ; ( d ) @xmath73.,width=264 ]    finally we emphasize that although the system exhibits emergent insulating phases at other @xmath84s where there are two identical sites in one unit cell , only those emerging at inversion- symmetric points are topological . in fig.[fig5 ] , we calculate the berry phase as a function of @xmath84 at two typical fillings for @xmath85 .",
    "it shows that the berry phases of the insulators are only quantized to 0 or @xmath0 at inversion - symmetric points .",
    "however when an insulator is emergent , its berry phase has nontrivial value @xmath0 .",
    "so the identified topological bosonic insulators are protected by inversion symmetry , which provide concrete models for the classifications of 1d topological bosonic phases @xcite .     of the superlattice at the filling : ( a ) @xmath86 ; ( b ) @xmath87 . here",
    "the parameter @xmath85 and the lattice size @xmath88 are used.,width=264 ]",
    "we study the topological phase diagram of interacting bosons in 1d superlattices with inversion symmetry . the complete phase diagram is obtained and the topological properties of the identified insulators are determined .",
