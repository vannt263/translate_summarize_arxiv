    "high harmonic generation ( hhg ) is a nonlinear phenomenon in which atoms interacting with an intense laser pulse emit photons whose frequencies are integer multiples of the driving laser frequency .",
    "the emphatic motivation is the generation of spatially and temporally coherent bursts of attosecond pulses with high frequencies covering a range from vacuum ultraviolet ( vuv ) to the soft x - ray region  @xcite .",
    "filtering the high - frequency part of a high - harmonic spectrum allows the syntheses of ultrashort , coherent light pulses with energies in the extreme ultraviolet ( xuv ) part of the spectrum .",
    "this allows for tracing and controlling electronic processes in atoms , as well as coupled vibrational and electronic processes in molecules  @xcite .",
    "some of the most visible applications of ultrashort pulses of attosecond duration involve resolving the electronic structure with high degree of spatial and temporal resolution  @xcite , controlling the dynamics in the xuv - pumped excited molecules  @xcite , and exciting and probing inner - shell electron dynamics with high resolution  @xcite .",
    "time - resolved holography  @xcite , imaging of molecular orbitals  @xcite , and attosecond streaking  @xcite are also among the state - of - the - art applications of hhg .",
    "high - order harmonic generation is a process well described within the semi - classical three step model ( ionization , propagation followed by recombination ) .",
    "the plateau region , where consecutive harmonics have approximately the same intensity , constitutes the main body of a high - harmonic spectrum .",
    "first step of the three step model is the tunneling of the electron through the coulomb potential barrier suppressed by the laser field .",
    "the second step is laser - driven propagation of the free electron , and the third step is the rescattering of the electron with its parent ion . during this last step ,",
    "the electron can recombine with its parent ion and liberate its excess energy as a short wavelength harmonic photon .",
    "the three step model predicts that the highest kinetic energy that an electron gains during its laser - driven excursion is given by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the quiver energy of the free electron in the laser field , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the laser field amplitude and frequency .",
    "the highest harmonic frequency , @xmath12 , that can be generated within this model is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the binding energy of electron in the atom and @xmath15 is the order of the cut - off harmonic  @xcite .",
    "a crucial assumption in this physical picture is that the electron tunnels into the continuum in the first step in a laser field characterized by a small keldysh parameter .",
    "this liberates the electron with no excess kinetic energy , and its subsequent excursion is driven by the classical laser field alone .",
    "keldysh parameter @xmath1 is commonly used to refer to one of the two dominant ionization dynamics in strong fields ; tunneling or multiphoton regimes  @xcite .",
    "it is defined as the the time it takes for the electron to tunnel the barrier in units of the laser period , i.e. , @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath17 is the tunneling time and @xmath18 is the laser period .",
    "if the tunneling time is much smaller than the laser period , one could expect that it is likely for the electron to tunnel through the barrier .",
    "in contrast , if tunneling time is much longer than the laser period , then the electron does nt have enough time tunnel through the depressed coulomb barrier , and ionization can only occur through photon absorption .",
    "the keldysh parameter can be expressed as @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "although the keldysh parameter is widely used to refer to the underlying dynamics in strong field ionization , there are studies which suggest that it is an inadequate parameter in making this assessment  @xcite when a large range of laser frequencies are considered .",
    "thus , it is natural to ask what happens in the strong field ionization step of hhg as a function of @xmath2 , as relevant parameters , such as laser intensity and frequency , are varied while @xmath1 is kept fixed . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the hhg process from the ground and the rydberg states of a hydrogen atom using a one - dimensional @xmath20-wave model supported by fully three - dimensional quantum simulations .",
    "the central idea is that in a hydrogen atom , both the field strength @xmath10 and the frequency @xmath11 scale in a particular fashion with the principal quantum number @xmath2 . scaling the field strength by @xmath21 and the frequency by @xmath22 ,",
    "it is evident that @xmath19 remains unaffected as @xmath2 is changed , provided that both @xmath10 and @xmath11 are scaled accordingly while @xmath2 is varied .    in the spirit of the keldysh theory , going beyond the ground state and starting from higher @xmath2 as the initial state , scaling @xmath10 and @xmath11 to maintain a fixed value of @xmath1 should keep the ionization step of the harmonic generation in the same dynamical regime .",
    "we calculate hhg spectra starting from the ground state of hydrogen using laser parameters for which @xmath23 ( tunneling ) , and then calculate the high - harmonic spectra from increasingly larger @xmath2-states , scaling @xmath10 and @xmath11 from the ground state simulations and keep @xmath1 fixed . if the keldysh parameter is indeed adequate in referring to the ionization step properly in hhg , one should expect that the physics of the three - step process would remain unchanged , as the remainder of the steps involve only classical propagation of the electron in the continuum , and the final recombination step , which is governed by the conservation of energy .",
    "there are a number of studies devoted to hhg from rydberg atoms .",
    "the main motivation in these efforts are primarily increasing the conversion efficiency in the harmonic generation to obtain higher yields , which in turn would enable the generation of more intense attosecond pulses .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite demonstrated that , by stabilization of excited outer electron of the rydberg atom in an intense field , a highly efficient harmonic spectrum could be generated from the more strongly bound inner electrons . in another recent study , zhai _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed that an enhanced harmonic spectrum is possible if the initial state is prepared as a superposition of the ground and the first excited state .",
    "the idea behind this method is that when coupled with the ground state , ionization can occur out of the excited state , initiating the harmonic generation .",
    "since the excited state has lower ionization potential than the ground state , this in principle can result in higher conversion efficiency if the electron subsequently recombines into the excited state . in this scenario",
    ", the high - harmonic plateau would still cut - off at the semiclassical limit @xmath5 with @xmath24 being that of the excited state .",
    "if , however , upon ionization out of the excited state , the electron recombines into the ground state , the cut - off can be pushed up to higher harmonics .",
    "same principle is also at play in numerous studies proposing two - color driving schemes for hhg , with one frequency component serving to excite the ground state up to an excited level with a lower ionization potential , thus increasing the ionization yield ( see for example  @xcite ) .    in this paper , we report hhg spectra from ground and various rydberg states with @xmath2 up to 40 for hydrogen atom , where the laser intensity and the frequency are such that the ionization step occurs predominantly in the tunneling regime . starting with @xmath25 at @xmath3 , we go up in @xmath2 of the initial state and scale @xmath10 by @xmath21 and @xmath11 by @xmath22 , keeping @xmath1 constant .",
    "we discuss the underlying mechanism in terms of field ionization and final @xmath2-distributions after the laser pulse .",
    "we find that the harmonic order of the cut - off predicted by the semiclassical three - step model scales as @xmath26 when @xmath10 and @xmath11 are scaled as described above , and @xmath1 is kept fixed .",
    "we repeat some of these model simulations by solving the fully three - dimensional time - dependent schrdinger equation to investigate the effects which may arise due to angular momenta in high-@xmath2 manifolds . for select initial @xmath2 states ,",
    "we look at momentum distributions of the ionized electrons , and the wave function extending beyond the peak of the depressed coulomb potential at @xmath27 .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we use atomic units throughout .",

    "this choice of time range centers the carrier envelope of the laser at @xmath32 , which simplifies its mathematical expression .",

    "our one dimensional model is an @xmath20-wave model and restricted to the half space @xmath36 with a hard wall at @xmath37 .",
    "having a hard wall at @xmath37 when there is no angular momentum can potentially be problematic , because the electron can absorb energy from the hard wall when using @xmath38 potential .",
    "however , we believe that this model is adequate for the problem at hand , because we are deep in the tunneling regime . in our calculations ,",
    "the number of photons required for ionization to occur through photon absroption is @xmath399 for @xmath3 , approaches to 71 by @xmath40 and stays so for higher @xmath2 . as a result",
    ", ionization takes place primarily in the tunneling regime .",
    "if an extra photon is absorbed at the hard wall , its effect would mostly concern the lowest harmonics , which we are not interested in . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory_hhg3d ] , we show that the results we obtain in this section are consistent with our findings from fully three - dimensional calculations .",
    "we consider cases in which the electron is initially prepared in an @xmath41 state , where @xmath2 ranges from 1 up to 40 .",
    "our pulse duration is 4-cycles at fwhm for each case , and the wavelength of the laser field is 800 nm for the ground state .",
    "this gives a 2.7 fs optical cycle when the wavelength is 800 nm .",
    "thus , the total pulse duration @xmath17 for the ground state is @xmath3911 fs and it scales as @xmath42 . for the 4s state ,",
    "this results in a pulse duration of @xmath39704 fs , while it amounts to @xmath395.6 ps for the 8s state .    for the numerical solution of equation  ( [ schro ] )",
    ", we perform a series of calculations to make sure that the mesh and box size of the radial grid and the time step we use are fine enough so that our results are converged to within a few per cent .",
    "as we go beyond the 1s state , we increase the radial box size to accommodate the growing size of the initial state and the interaction region .",
    "we propagate eq .   for excited states using a square - root mesh of the form @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the index of a radial grid point , @xmath45",
    ", @xmath46 is the box size , and @xmath47 is the number of grid points .",
    "this type of grid is more efficient than using a uniform mesh in problems involving rydberg states  @xcite , because it puts roughly the same number of points between the successive nodes of a rydberg state . for the ground state , the box size is @xmath48 a.u . and",

    "this is an artifact of the scheme we employ in which we divide up the rydberg series into successive groups of @xmath2s states to ensure sizable hhg spectra .",

    "after excursion in the laser field , it recombines with its parent ion . in this last step",

    "this is because the electron was liberated into the continuum with virtually no excess kinetic energy , and the electron wavepacket mainly retains its original character .",

    "performing such classical simulations can yield no insight to how the excursion step of the hhg behaves under the scaling scheme we have employed so far .",

    "one way to examine the excursion step by itself in our quantum simulations is to look at the momentum distribution of the part of the wavefunction that contributes to the hhg spectra .    to this end , we calculate the momentum map of the ionized part of the wavefunction when the atom is initially prepared in the 4s state . the reason we look at the ionized part of the wavefunction is because harmonic generation and ionization are competing processes",

    "are visible close to the laser polarization direction .",
    "we also look at the momentum map of the wavefunction inside our numerical box that falls beyond the peak of the depressed coulomb potential at @xmath173 .",

    "expectedly , both momentum maps for the 4s and the 8s initial states show the same structures , the essential difference being the number of nodes in the momentum space wave functions which scales as @xmath178 . incidentally , a rescattering event is visible on the laser polarization axis at @xmath153 in panel d of the 4s column , giving rise to kinetic energy beyond the @xmath8 limit on the left .",
    "we have presented results from one- and three - dimensional time - dependent quantum calculations for higher - order harmonic generation from excited states of h atom for a fixed keldysh parameter @xmath1 .",
    "starting from the ground state , we chose laser intensity and frequency such that we are in the tunneling regime and ionization probability is well below one per cent .",
    "we then scale the intensity by @xmath102 and the frequency by @xmath22 to keep @xmath1 fixed as we increase the principal quantum number @xmath2 of the initial state of the atom .",
    "because @xmath1 is fixed , the common wisdom is that the dynamical regime which determine the essential physics should stay unchanged in the hhg process as we go up in @xmath2 of the initial state .",
    "our one - dimensional calculations demonstrate that this is indeed the case , and although the emitted power ( hhg yield ) drops as we climb up in @xmath2 , the resulting harmonic spectra display same _ universal _ features beyond @xmath2@xmath3910 .",
    "the most distinguished feature that develops when the atom is initially prepared in a rydberg state is the emergence of a secondary plateau below the semiclassical cut - off @xmath179 in the hhg plateau .",
    "this secondary cut - off splits the harmonic plateau into two regions : one spanning low harmonics and terminating with a secondary cut - off , and a second plateau with lower yield and higher harmonics terminating at the usual semiclassical cut - off at @xmath179 .",

    "the harmonic spectra appear universal and , except for the overall yields , the spectra for high @xmath2 look essentially identical .",
    "we then carried out fully three - dimensional calculations for three of the @xmath2 states in the lowest @xmath2-group in the one - dimensional calculations to gain further insight into the scaling properties we have seen in the one - dimensional calculations .",
    "this also serves to investigate possible effects of having angular momentum .",
    "we found the same features as in the one - dimensional spectra , except that the yield from the first plateau is skewed towards lower harmonics .",
    "we associate this with spreading to higher @xmath2 states during the tunnel ionization and recombination steps by analyzing the @xmath2- and @xmath7-distributions of the atom after the laser pulse .",
    "momentum distributions of the ionized electrons and the wave function beyond the peak of the depressed coulomb potential at @xmath173 show features which we can relate to the universal features we see in the hhg spectra at high @xmath2 .",
