    "the ability to perform an arbitrary operation on a quantum system is a crucial prerequisite for advanced quantum information processing and quantum computing . in optical implementations ,",
    "quantum states of light are manipulated mainly with passive and active linear optical elements such as beam splitters and squeezers .",
    "the resulting state transformations preserve the gaussian form of the wigner function and are thus referred to as gaussian operations .",
    "it is readily apparent that such operations alone are not sufficient for universal continuous - variable ( cv ) quantum computation @xcite and must be supplemented by access to some other resources such as nonlinear dynamics @xcite , single - photon detectors @xcite , or non - gaussian states @xcite .",
    "while several schemes for generation of highly nonclassical states of light and implementation of various non - gaussian operations have been suggested @xcite , a systematic study of usefulness of non - gaussian states for universal quantum state manipulation and engineering has been missing .",
    "the core of our argument is the reduction of the problem to generation of single - photon fock states @xmath0 from the resource state @xmath1 .",
    "we provide explicit scheme for this latter task and assess its performance . for the sake of presentation clarity",
    "we explain the protocol on the example of traveling light modes , but the scheme is applicable also to other physical platforms such as atomic ensembles or optomechanical systems .",
    "we start by demonstrating that only single - photon states , apart from gaussian operations and measurements , are required for probabilistic implementation of arbitrary quantum operation on @xmath2 .",
    "a crucial observation is that the projection on a single - photon state can be performed with help of an ancillary single - photon state , a balanced beam splitter and a pair of homodyne detectors measuring amplitude quadrature @xmath3 and phase quadrature @xmath4 , respectively , c.f .",
    "[ fig_singlephotondet](a ) .",
    "successful projection is heralded by outcomes @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in this case , the two input modes impinging on the balanced beam splitter are projected on the maximally entangled epr state @xmath7 .",
    "this in conjunction with the ancillary single - photon state implements the probabilistic projection on a single - photon state , @xmath8 to achieve a nonzero success probability , a finite acceptance window for the measurement outcomes @xmath3 and @xmath4 has to be introduced , which reduces the fidelity of the projection and leads to trade - off between operation quality and its success probability .",
    "this is an unavoidable feature of our protocol arising from involvement of only gaussian measurements .",
    "single - photon states and single - photon measurements combined with gaussian operations are sufficient for probabilistic preparation of arbitrary multimode quantum state @xcite and implementation of arbitrary transformation on @xmath2 , e.g. by exploiting the scheme described in ref .",
    "@xcite or simply by quantum teleportation @xcite .",
    "the whole question about nature of non - gaussian resources sufficient for universal quantum state manipulation is thereby reduced to finding a class of states from which a single - photon state can be generated with help of only gaussian operations and measurements .",
    "we are going to show that any collection of non - gaussian pure states possessing finite expansion in the fock - state basis is sufficient for this .",
    "let us consider a steady supply of states of the form @xmath9 an essential ingredient of our protocol is the setup depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_singlephotondet](b ) which employs one auxiliary state @xmath10 and gaussian operations to remove the highest fock state @xmath11 from the input state @xmath12 .",
    "this produces a state @xmath13 and this operation can be thus seen as a version of approximative photon subtraction .",
    "first part of the process lies in a deterministic transformation of @xmath10 into a state @xmath14 with @xmath15 and missing vacuum term , @xmath16 .",
    "this can be achieved by coherent displacement of the state @xmath10 if the displacement amplitude @xmath17 satisfies @xmath18 such @xmath17 exists for all finite @xmath19 .",
    "however , for a particular set of scenarios , _",
    "e.g. _ when @xmath20 , this approach does not work as the required displacement is @xmath21 corresponding to no action at all and the scheme in fig .",
    "[ fig_singlephotondet](b ) would produce vacuum state from input @xmath10 .",
    "this problem can be fortunately circumvented using an ancillary vacuum mode , a beam splitter , a single homodyne detection and feed - forward , see fig .",
    "[ fig_singlephotondet](b ) . after passing through the beam splitter with transmittance @xmath22 , the homodyne detection of the amplitude quadrature @xmath23 yielding a value @xmath24 , and the displacement @xmath17",
    ", the state @xmath25 transforms into @xmath26 where @xmath27 for any @xmath28 . by employing the relation for an overlap of a quadrature eigenstate and a fock state , @xmath29 where @xmath30 stands for the hermite polynomial",
    ", we can see that to arrive at the form ( [ 1step02 ] ) with @xmath16 and @xmath15 for an arbitrary measured value @xmath24 , the real displacement @xmath17 must satisfy @xmath31 where @xmath32",
    ". the first condition can be for all values of @xmath24 fulfilled by a suitable choice of @xmath17 , while the second condition is in these cases satisfied automatically , as hermite polynomials of unequal orders have different roots .",
    "to summarize , the universal setup for deterministic generation of a state ( [ 1step02 ] ) from a completely arbitrary state @xmath10 consists of a beam splitter , homodyne detection , and a suitable displacement operation , where the specific values of parameters have to be adjusted according to the state employed .",
    "also note that the displacement operation could be replaced by a suitable post - selection - allowing only states for which no displacement is necessary and discarding the rest .",
    "thus , experimental feasibility can be gained at the cost of a reduced success rate .    to perform the approximate photon subtraction on the input state @xmath33 ,",
    "this state in mode 1 is combined with vacuum in mode 2 on a beam splitter with transmittance @xmath34 yielding a two - mode entangled state at the output . a balanced beam splitter and a pair of homodyne detectors",
    "are then used to project the mode @xmath35 and the mode @xmath36 prepared in auxiliary state @xmath37 onto the epr state @xmath38 , c.f fig .",
    "this conditionally prepares the remaining output mode @xmath39 in the state @xmath13 , where @xmath40",
    "the complete scheme for preparation of single - photon state from @xmath19 copies of state @xmath10 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_total ] . by repeated application of the approximate photon subtraction we can transform any state @xmath10 to a state @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 can be made real by a suitable phase shift .",
    "this state is then combined with vacuum on a beam splitter with transmittance @xmath45 , @xmath46 if we postselect the events when the measurement outcome is @xmath47 , we remove the vacuum term by destructive quantum interference and obtain the desired single - photon state .    as a demonstration ,",
    "let us now explicitly show the procedure to create a single - photon state from a pair of two - photon states @xmath48 .",
    "the full scheme is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_twophoton ] .",
    "it can be easily shown that to generate the single - photon state the feed - forward displacement @xmath17 should read @xmath49 where @xmath50 represents a value obtained by the homodyne measurement of the amplitude quadrature @xmath50 of mode 3 .",
    "the other three homodyne detectors measure amplitude quadratures @xmath51 and @xmath52 of modes @xmath35 and @xmath53 , respectively , and phase quadrature @xmath54 of mode @xmath36 .",
    "successful preparation of state @xmath0 is heralded by the measurement outcomes @xmath55    in real experimental practice we can not condition on the projection on a single quadrature eigenstate @xmath56 , as this corresponds to an event with zero probability of success .",
    "instead , we have to accept all events when the measured value falls within a narrow interval centered at @xmath57 , thus realizing a povm element @xmath58 where the parameter @xmath59 determines the half - width of the post - selection interval and @xmath60 labels the mode that is measured .",
    "this of course effects the output state .",
    "the global input state encompassing five modes , as can be seen in fig .",

    "we employ the fidelity , @xmath74 , which in this case reliably quantifies the content of the single - photon state in the overall mixture .",
    "the transmittances of the beam splitters were optimized as to maximize the probability of success @xmath75 in the limit of very narrow acceptance windows ( @xmath76 ) : @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the trade - off between fidelity and the success probability is clearly visible in fig .",

    "finally we are going to present a full implementation of a non - gaussian operation using only gaussian operations and measurements and ancillary states @xmath10 .",
    "the resource states are again going to be the two - photon states @xmath48 from which the single - photon states are extracted by means of procedure depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_twophoton ] .",
    "the non - gaussian operation under consideration is the nonlinear sign gate @xcite which transforms a generic state @xmath80 into @xmath81 .",
    "this represents a unitary evolution induced by a kerr - type hamiltonian @xmath82 on a three - dimensional hilbert space spanned by @xmath83 .",
    "a celebrated result in linear - optics quantum computing is that this gate can be implemented with help of only beam splitters , one ancillary single - photon state , and two measurements , one projecting on a single - photon state , the other on the vacuum state @xcite , see fig .",

    ", we can determine the mixed two - mode state @xmath90 produced by the scheme and the success probability of the scheme for finite acceptance windows on homodyne detections .",
    "the fidelity of the operation can now be expressed as @xmath91 figure  [ fig_kerrtwophoton ] shows the resulting relations between the fidelity , the post - selection threshold @xmath59 , and the probability of success .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated that a steady supply of pure non - gaussian states possessing finite expansion in the fock - state basis , together with the experimentally readily accessible gaussian operations and gaussian measurements , is sufficient for universal quantum state manipulation and engineering .",
    "the required ancilla non - gaussian states could be generated e.g. using squeezing operations , coherent displacements and conditional single - photon subtraction @xcite .",
    "the conditional photon subtraction can be performed reliably with avalanche photo - diode detectors even though their overall detection efficiency is of the order of 50% or even lower .",
    "the low efficincy only reduces the success probability of the state - preparation scheme but not the fidelity of the prepared state @xcite .",
    "in contrast , such detectors are unsuitable for direct implementation of measurement induced non - gaussian operations using the schemes proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite becuase the low efficiency would imply reduced fidelity of the gate . in our approach we thus replace direct single - photon detection by an indirect detection relying on off - line produced non - gaussian states and homodyne detection . in this way it is possible to achieve high fidelity at the expense of probabilistic nature of the scheme .",
    "our generic scheme involves several optimization possibilities and its efficiency can be improved by tuning the transmittances of beam splitters and the widths of the acceptance windows of homodyne measurements .",
    "moreover , it is likely that for each particular task the efficiency can be improved significantly by using specific dedicated scheme tailored to a given resource state @xmath92    our findings shall find applications in advanced optical quantum information processing and quantum state engineering . on more fundamental side ,",
    "our results shed more light on the quantum information processing power of non - gaussian states and they help to bridge the gap between single - photon and continuous - variable approaches ."
