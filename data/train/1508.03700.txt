    "the statistical analysis of precipitation data is an interesting problem of major environmental importance @xcite . of particular interest",
    "are extreme events of rainfall , which can lead to floodings if a given threshold is exceeded . from a mathematical and statistical point of view",
    ", it is natural to apply extreme value statistics to measured rainfall data , but it is not so clear which class of the known extreme value statistics , if any , is applicable , and how the results differ from one spatial location to another . another interesting quantity to look at is the waiting time between rainy days .",
    "extreme events of waiting times in this context correspond to droughts .",
    "so an interesting question is what type of drought statistics is implied by the observed distribution of waiting times between rainfall periods if this is extrapolated to very long waiting times .",
    "in this paper we present a systematic investigation of the probability distributions of the amount of daily rainfall at variety of different locations on the earth , and of waiting time distributions on a scale of days and hours .",
    "our main result is that the observed distributions of the amount of rainfall are well - fitted by @xmath0-exponentials , rather than exponentials , which suggests that techniques borrowed from nonextensive statistical mechanics @xcite and superstatistics @xcite could be potentially useful to better understand the rainfall statistics . an entropic exponent of @xmath3 is typically observed .",
    "in fact , based on the fact that @xmath0-exponentials asymptotically decay with a power law , we discuss the corresponding extreme value statistics that is highly relevant in the context of floodings produced by extreme rainfall events .",
    "we also investigate the waiting time distribution between rainy events , which is much better described by an exponential , although an entropic exponent close to 1 such as @xmath4 seems to give the best fits .",
    "we discuss possible dynamical reasons for the occurrence of @xmath0-exponentials in this context .",
    "one possible reason could be superstatistical fluctuations of a variance parameter or a rate parameter .",
    "let us explain this a bit further .",
    "superstatistical techniques have been discussed in many papers @xcite and they represent a powerful method to model and/or analyse complex systems with two ( or more ) clearly separated time scales in the dynamics . the basic idea is to consider for the theoretical modelling a superposition of many systems of statistical mechanics in local equilibrium , each with its own local variance parameter @xmath5 , and finally perform an average over the fluctuating @xmath5 .",
    "the probability density of @xmath5 is denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "most generally , the parameter @xmath5 can be any system parameter that exhibits large - scale fluctuations , such as energy dissipation in a turbulent flow , or volatility in financial markets .",
    "another possibility is to regard @xmath5 as the rate parameter of a local poisson process , as done , for example , in @xcite .",
    "ultimately all expectation values relevant for the complex system under consideration are averaged over the distribution @xmath6 .",
    "many applications have been described in the past , including modelling the statistics of classical turbulent flow @xcite , quantum turbulence @xcite , space - time granularity @xcite , stock price changes @xcite , wind velocity fluctuations @xcite , sea level fluctuations @xcite , infection pathways of a virus @xcite , migration trajectories of tumour cells @xcite , and much more @xcite .",
    "superstatistical systems , when integrated over the fluctuating parameter , are effectively described by more general versions of statistical mechanics , where formally the boltzmann - gibbs entropy is replaced by more general entropy measures @xcite .",
    "the concept can also be generalized to general dynamical systems with slowly varying system parameters , see @xcite for some recent rigorous results in this direction .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to better understand the extreme event statistics of rainfall at various example locations on the earth",
    ". we will start with a careful analysis of experimentally recorded time series of the amount of rainfall measured at a given location , whose probability density is highly relevant to model the corresponding extreme event statistics @xcite .",
    "ultimately of course all this rainfall dynamics can be formally regarded as being produced by a highly nonlinear and high - dimensional deterministic dynamical system in a chaotic state , producing the occasional rainfall event , hence it is useful to keep in mind the basic results of extreme event statistics for weakly correlated events as generated by mixing dynamical systems .",
    "recently there has been much activity on the rigorous application of extreme values theory to deterministic dynamical systems @xcite and also to stochastically perturbed ones @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature of the dynamical system approach is that there exist some correlations between events , and hence the extreme value theory used to tackle it must account for this correlation going beyond a theory that is just based on sequences of events that are statistically independent . in the superstatistics approach , correlations are also present , due to the fact that parameter changes take place on long time scales , but the relaxation time of the system is short as compared to the time scale of these parameter changes , so that local equilibrium is quickly reached .    what is worked out in this paper is a comparison with experimentally measured rainfall data , to decide which extreme event statistics should be most plausibly applied to various questions related to amount of rainfall and waiting times between rainfall events .",
    "extreme value theory quite generally tells us ( under suitable asymptotic independence assumptions ) that there are only three possible limit distributions , namely , the gumbel , frchet and weibull distribution . but are these assumptions of near - independence satisfied for rainfall data , and if yes , which of the above three classes are relevant ? this is the subject of this paper",
    ". we will also discuss simple deterministic dynamical system models that generate superstatistical processes in this context .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present histograms of rainfall statistics , extracted from experimentally measured time series of rainfall at various locations on the earth .",
    "what is seen is that the probability density of amount of rainfall is very well fitted by @xmath0-exponentials .",
    "we discuss the generalized statistical mechanics foundations of this based on nonextensive statistical mechanics with entropic index @xmath0 , with @xmath3 . in section iii",
    "we look at waiting time distributions ( on a daily and hourly scale ) between rainy episodes . these are observed to be close to exponential functions , similar as for the poisson process .",
    "however , a careful analysis shows that a slightly better fit is again given by @xmath0-exponentials , but this time with @xmath0 much closer to 1 .",
    "a simple superstatistical model for this is discussed in section iv , a poisson process that has a rate parameter that fluctuates in a superstatistical way .",
    "we review standard extreme event statistics in section v and then , in section vi , based on the measured experimental results of rainfall statistics , we develop the corresponding extreme value statistics . in section",
    "vii we analyse the ambiguities that arise for the extreme event statistics of waiting times , depending on whether we assume the waiting time distribution is either an exact exponential or a slightly deformed @xmath0-exponential as produced by superstatistical fluctuations .",
    "finally , in section viii we describe a dynamical systems approach to superstatistics .",
    "we performed a systematic investigation of time series of rainfall data for 8 different example locations on the earth ( figs .  1 - 8 ) .",
    "the data are from various publicly available web sites .",
    "when doing a histogram of the amount of daily rainfall observed , a surprising feature arises .",
    "all distributions are power law rather than exponential .",
    "they are well fitted by so - called @xmath0-exponentials , functions of the form @xmath7 which are well - motivated by generalized versions of statistical mechanics relevant for systems with long - range interactions , temperature fluctuations and multifractal phase space structure @xcite .",
    "of course the ordinary exponential is recovered for @xmath8 . whereas the data of most locations are well fitted by @xmath3 , central england and vancouver",
    "have somewhat lower values of @xmath0 closer to 1.13 .",
    "one may speculate what the reason for this power law is .",
    "nevertheless , the formalism of nonextensive statistical mechanics @xcite is designed to describe complex systems with spatial or temporal long - range interactions , and @xmath0-exponentials occur in this formalism as generalized canonical distributions that maximize @xmath0-entropy @xmath9 where the @xmath10 are the probabilities of the microstates @xmath11 .",
    "ordinary statistical mechanics is recovered in the limit @xmath8 , where the @xmath0-entropy @xmath12 reduces to the shannon entropy @xmath13 the generalized canonical distributions maximize the @xmath0-entropy subject to suitable constraints . in our case the constraint is given by the average amount of daily rainfall at a given location .",
    "the way rainfall is produced is indeed influenced by highly complex weather systems and condensation processes in clouds , so one may speculate that more general versions of statistical mechanics could be relevant as an effective description . also for hydrodynamic turbulent systems",
    "@xcite and pattern forming systems @xcite these generalized statistical mechanics methods have previously been shown to yield a good effective description .",
    "the amount of rain falling on a given day is a complicated spatio - temporal stochastic process with intrinsic correlations , as rainy weather often has a tendency to persist for a while , both spatially and temporally .",
    "the actual value of @xmath0 for the observed rainfall statistics reflects characteristic effective properties in the climate and temporal precipitation pattern at the given location . for temperature distributions at the same locations as in fig.1 - 8 ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "-exponential @xmath14 .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 is fitted for the various locations . for central england , @xmath15 . ]",
    "@xmath16    .",
    "another interesting observable that we extracted from the data is the waiting time distribution between rainy episodes .",
    "we did this both for a time scale of days and a time scale of hours .",
    "a given day is marked as rainy if it rains for some time during that day .",
    "the waiting time is then the number of days one has to wait until it rains again , this is a random variable with a given distribution which we can extract from the data .",
    "results for the waiting time distributions are shown in fig .",
    "what one observes here is that the distribution is nearly exponential .",
    "that means the poisson process of nearly independent point events of rainy days is a reasonably good model .    at closer inspection",
    ", however , one sees that again a slightly deformed @xmath0-exponential , this time with @xmath4 , is a better fit of the waiting time distribution . as worked out in the next section",
    ", one may explain this with a superstatistical poisson process , i.e. a poisson process whose rate parameter  on a long time scale exhibits fluctuations that are @xmath17-distributed , with a rather large number of degrees of freedom @xmath18 .",
    "we start with a very simple model for the return time of rainfall events ( or extreme rainfall events ) on any given time scale .",
    "this is to assume that the events follows a poisson process . for a poisson process",
    "the waiting times are exponentially distributed ,    @xmath19    here , @xmath20 is the time from one event ( peak over threshold ) to the next one , and @xmath5 is a positive parameter , the rate of the poisson process .",
    "the symbol @xmath21 denotes the conditional probability density to observe a return time @xmath20 provided the parameter @xmath5 has certain given value .",
    "the key idea of the superstatistics approach @xcite can be applied to this simple model , thus constructing a superstatistical poisson process . in this case the parameter @xmath5 is regarded as a fluctuating random variable as well , but these fluctuations take place on a very large time scale .",
    "for example , for our rainfall statistics the time scale on which @xmath5 fluctuates may correspond to weeks ( different weather conditions ) whereas our data base records rainfall events on an hourly basis .",
    "if @xmath5 is distributed with probability density @xmath6 , and fluctuates on a large time scale , then one obtains the marginal distribution of the return time statistics as @xmath22    this marginal distribution is actually what is recorded when we sample histograms of the observational data .    by inferring directly on a simple model for the distribution @xmath6 , a more complex model for the return times can be derived without much technical complexity .",
    "for example , consider that there are @xmath18 different gaussian random variables @xmath23 , that influence the dynamics of the intensity parameter @xmath5 as a random variable .",
    "we may thus assume as a very simple model that @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "then the probability density of @xmath5 is given by a @xmath17-distribution : @xmath27 where @xmath18 is the number of degrees of freedom and @xmath28 is a shape parameter that has the physical meaning of being the average of @xmath5 formed with the distribution @xmath6 .",
    "the integral ( [ eq : marg - ss - dist ] ) is easily evaluated and one obtains the @xmath0-exponential distribution : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    to sum up , this model generates @xmath0-exponential distributions by a simple mechanism , fluctuations of a rate parameter @xmath5 .",
    "typical @xmath0-values obtained in our fits are @xmath32 for rainfall amount and @xmath33 for waiting time between rainfall events .",
    "classic extreme value theory is concerned with the probability distribution of unlikely events .",
    "given a stationary stochastic process @xmath34 , consider the random variable @xmath35 defined as the maximum over the first @xmath18-observations :    @xmath36    in many cases the limit of the random variable @xmath35 may degenerate when @xmath37 .",
    "analogously to central limit laws for partial sums , the degeneracy of the limit can be avoided by considering a rescaled sequence @xmath38 for suitable normalising values @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "indeed , extreme value theory studies the existence of normalising values such that    @xmath41    as @xmath37 , with @xmath42 a non - degenerate probability distribution .",
    "two cornerstones in extreme value theory are the fisher - tippet theorem @xcite and the gnedenko theorem @xcite .",
    "the former asserts that if the limiting distribution @xmath43 exist , then it must be either one of three possible types , whereas the latter theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the convergence of each of the types .",
    "a third cornerstone in extreme value theory are the leadbetter conditions @xcite .",
    "these are a kind of weak asymptotic independence conditions , under which the two previous theorems generalize to stationary stochastic series satisfying them .",
    "let us review these results in somewhat more detail .    in the case where the process @xmath44 is independent identically distributed ( i.i.d .",
    ") the fisher - tippett theorem states that if @xmath45 is i.i.d . and",
    "there exist sequences @xmath39 and @xmath40 such that the limit distribution @xmath43 is non - degenerate , then it belongs to one of the following types :    type i : : :    @xmath46 for    @xmath47 .",
    "this distribution is known as the    _ gumbel _ extreme value distribution ( e.v.d . ) .",
    "type ii : : :    @xmath48 , for    @xmath49 ; @xmath50 , otherwise ; where    @xmath51 is a parameter .",
    "this family of distributions    is known as the _ frchet _ e.v.d .",
    "type iii : : :    @xmath52 , for    @xmath53 ; @xmath54 , otherwise ; where    @xmath51 is a parameter .",
    "this family is known as the    _ weibull _ e.v.d .",
    "a further extension of this result is the gnedenko theorem , which provides a characterization of the convergence in each of these cases .",
    "let @xmath55 be an i.i.d .",
    "stochastic process and let @xmath56 be its cumulative distribution function .",
    "consider @xmath57 .",
    "the following conditions are necessary and sufficient for the convergence to each type of e.v.d . :",
    "type i : : :    there exists some strictly positive function @xmath58 such    that    @xmath59    for all real @xmath60 ; type ii : : :    @xmath61 and    @xmath62 ,    with @xmath63 , for each @xmath49 ; type iii : : :    @xmath64 and    @xmath65 ,    with @xmath63 , for each @xmath49 .",
    "this result implies that the extremal type is completely determined by the tail behaviour of the distribution @xmath66 .",
    "the rainfall data were well described by @xmath0-exponentials , but waiting time distributions were observed to be close to ordinary exponentials , with @xmath0 only deviating by a small amount from 1 .",
    "let us now discuss the differences in extreme value statistics that arise from theses different distributions .    in the case where @xmath67 is distributed as an ordinary exponential function with parameter @xmath68 , we have @xmath69 it is not difficult to check that the exponential distribution belongs to the gumbel domain of attraction .",
    "in other words , the extreme events associated to the exponential distribution will be gumbel distributed .",
    "recall that the @xmath0-exponential function is defined as @xmath70^{1/(1-q)},\\ ] ] with @xmath71 .",
    "a random variable @xmath67 is @xmath0-exponential distributed ( with parameter @xmath68 ) if its density function is equal to @xmath72 . in such a case ,",
    "its hazard function is @xmath73 where @xmath74 .    using the gnedenko theorem",
    "if follows that the @xmath0-exponential distribution belongs to the frchet domain of attraction . in this case the shape parameter of the frchet distribution @xmath75 is equal to @xmath76 .",
    "extremely large waiting times for rainfall events correspond to droughts . clearly , it is interesting to extrapolate our observed waiting time distributions to very large time scales . however , in section  [ sec : waiting - time ] we saw that in most cases it is difficult to discern if the waiting time distribution is that of a poisson process , distributed as an exponential , or if it is a @xmath0-exponential with @xmath0 close to one .",
    "this can make a huge difference for extreme value statistics .",
    "the aim of this section is to assess the impact of choosing one or the other model .",
    "consider @xmath77 a constant and @xmath67 a random variable modelled either by an exponential or a @xmath0-exponential . to normalize the problem",
    ", we can scale our analysis in terms of the mean .",
    "in other words , we look at the probability of @xmath67 being bigger than a multiple , say @xmath77-times , the mean of @xmath67 .",
    "if @xmath67 is distributed like an exponential with parameter @xmath68 , its mean is equal to @xmath78 and its hazard function is given by ( [ eq : hazard - exp ] ) .",
    "then it is easy to check that @xmath79    on the other hand , if @xmath67 is distributed like a @xmath0-exponential with parameter @xmath68 , its mean is equal to @xmath80 ( provided @xmath81 ) and its hazard function is given by ( [ eq : hazard - q - exp ] ) . in this case",
    "we have @xmath82    [ fig : returns ]    recall that the exponential distribution can be understood as the limit of the @xmath0-exponential as @xmath0 goes to @xmath83 .",
    "this is also true for the probability above , which converges to @xmath84 as @xmath0 goes to @xmath83 . in fig 15",
    "we plotted the probability of an event of level @xmath77 for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "for instance the probability of having an observation bigger than @xmath85 times the mean is @xmath86 for @xmath87 , @xmath88 when @xmath89 and @xmath90 when @xmath32 . when we look at the probability of an observation bigger than @xmath91 the mean , it is @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath86 respectively .",
    "apparently , the predicted drought statistics is very different choosing either the value @xmath87 or the very similar value @xmath89 for the observed waiting time distribution .",
    "this illustrates the general uncertainty in model building for extreme rainfall and drought events @xcite .",
    "ultimately , the weather and rainfall events at a given location can be regarded as being produced by a very high - dimensional deterministic dynamical system exhibiting chaotic properties .",
    "it is therefore useful to extend the superstatistics concept to general dynamical systems , following similar lines of arguments as in the recent paper @xcite .",
    "the basic idea here is that one has a given dynamics ( which , for simplicity , we take to be a discrete mapping @xmath94 on some phase space @xmath95 ) which depends on some control parameter @xmath96 .",
    "if @xmath96 is changing on a large time scale , much larger than the local relaxation time determined by the perron - frobenius operator of the mapping , then this dynamical system with slowly changing control parameter will ultimately generate a superposition of invariant densities for the given parameter @xmath96 .",
    "similarly , if we can calculate return times to certain particular regions of the phase space for a given parameter @xmath96 , then in the long term the return time distribution will have to be formed by taking an average over the slowly varying parameter @xmath96 . clearly , the connection to the previous sections is that a rainfall event corresponds to the trajectory of the dynamical system being in a particular subregion of the phase space @xmath95 , and the control parameter @xmath96 corresponds to the parameter @xmath5 used in the previous sections .",
    "let us consider families of maps @xmath97 depending on a control parameter @xmath96 .",
    "these can be _ a priori _ arbitrary maps in arbitrary dimensions , but it is useful to restrict the analysis to mixing maps and assume that an absolutely continuous invariant density @xmath98 exists for each value of the control parameter @xmath96 .",
    "the local dynamics is @xmath99 we allow for a time dependence of @xmath96 and study the long - term behavior of iterates given by @xmath100 clearly , the problem now requires the specification of the sequence of control parameters @xmath101 as well , at least in a statistical sense .",
    "one possibility is a periodic orbit of control parameters of length @xmath102 .",
    "another possibility is to regard the @xmath103 as random variables and to specify the properties of the corresponding stochastic process in parameter space .",
    "this then leads to a distribution of parameters @xmath96 .    in general , rapidly fluctuating parameters @xmath103 will lead to a very complicated dynamics .",
    "however , there is a significant simplification if the parameters @xmath103 change slowly .",
    "this is the analogue of the slowly varying temperature parameters in the superstatistical treatment of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "the basic assumption of superstatistics is that an environmental control parameter @xmath96 changes only very slowly , much slower than the local relaxation time of the dynamics . for maps",
    "this means that significant changes of @xmath96 occur only over a large number @xmath104 of iterations . for practical purposes one can model this superstatistical case as follows :",
    "one keeps @xmath105 constant for @xmath104 iterations ( @xmath106 ) , then switches after @xmath104 iterations to a new value @xmath107 , after @xmath104 iterations one switches to the next values @xmath108 , and so on .",
    "one of the simplest examples is a period-2 orbit in the parameter space .",
    "that is , we have an alternating sequence @xmath109 that repeats itself , with switching between the two possible values taking place after @xmath104 iterations .",
    "this case was given particular attention in @xcite , and rigorous results were derived for special types of maps where the invariant density @xmath110 as a function of the parameter @xmath96 is under full control , so - called blaschke products .    here we discuss two important examples , which are of importance in the context of the current paper , namely how to generate ( in a suitable limit ) a superstatistical langevin process , as well as a superstatistical poisson process , using strongly mixing maps .",
    "* example 1 * * superstatistical langevin - like process * we take for @xmath97 a map of linear langevin type @xcite .",
    "this means @xmath97 is a 2-dimensional map given by a skew product of the form @xmath111 here @xmath112 denote the average of iterates of @xmath113 .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that for @xmath114 , @xmath115 finite this deterministic chaotic map generates a dynamics equivalent to a linear langevin equation @xcite , provided the map @xmath113 has the so - called @xmath116-mixing property @xcite , and regarding the initial values @xmath117 $ ] as a smoothly distributed random variable . consequently , in this limit the variable @xmath118 converges to the ornstein - uhlenbeck process @xcite and its stationary density is given by @xmath119 the variance parameter @xmath5 of this gaussian depends on the map @xmath113 and the damping constant @xmath96 .",
    "if the parameter @xmath96 changes on a very large time scale , much larger than the local relaxation time to equilibrium , one expects for the long - term distribution of iterates a mixture of gaussian distributions with different variances @xmath120 .",
    "for example , a period 2 orbit of parameter changes yields a mixture of two gaussians @xmath121 generally , for more complicated parameter changes on the long time scale @xmath104 , the long - term distribution of iterates @xmath118 will be given by a mixture of gaussians with a suitable weight function @xmath122 for @xmath114 : @xmath123 this is just the usual form of superstatistics used in statistical mechanics , based on a mixture of gaussians with fluctuating variance with a given weight function @xcite .",
    "thus for this example of skew products the superstatistics of the map @xmath97 reproduces the concept of superstatistics in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics , based on the langevin equation .",
    "in fact , the map @xmath97 can be regarded as a possible microscopic dynamics underlying the langevin equation .",
    "the random forces pushing the particle left and right are in this case generated by deterministic chaotic map @xmath113 governing the dynamics of the variable @xmath124 .",
    "generally it is possible to consider any @xmath116-mixing map here @xcite .",
    "based on functional limit theorems , one can prove equivalence with the langevin equation in the limit @xmath114 .",
    "we note in passing that if the mixing property is not satisfied , then of course much more complicated probability distributions are expected for sums of iterates of a given map @xmath113 .",
    "numerical evidence has been presented that in this case often @xmath0-gaussians with @xmath125 are observed @xcite .",
    "* example 2 * * superstatistical poisson - like process *    take @xmath94 to be a strongly mixing map , for example the binary shift map @xmath126 on the interval @xmath127 $ ] . consider a very small subset of the phase space of size @xmath128 , say @xmath129 $ ] and a generic trajectory of the binary shift map for a generic initial value @xmath130 , where @xmath131 are the digits of the binary expansion of the initial value @xmath132 .",
    "we define a ` rainfall ' event to happen if this trajectory enters @xmath133 ( of course , for true rainfall events the dynamical system is much more complicated and lives on a much higher - dimensional phase space ) .",
    "it is obvious that the above sequence of events follows poisson - like statistics , as the iterates of the binary shift map are strongly mixing , which means asymptotic statistical independence for a large number of iterations . indeed between successive visits of the very small interval @xmath133",
    ", there is a large number of iterations and hence near - independence .",
    "hence the binary shift map generates a very good approximation of the poisson process for small enough @xmath128 , and the waiting time distribution between events is exponential .",
    "we may of course also look at a more complicated system @xmath97 , where we iterate a strongly mixing map @xmath97 which depends on a parameter @xmath96 , and where the invariant density @xmath110 of the map @xmath97 depends on the control parameter in a nontrivial way .",
    "examples are blaschke products , studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "if the parameter @xmath96 varies on a large time scale , so does the probability @xmath134 of iterates to enter the region @xmath133 , and hence the rate parameter of the above poisson - like process will also vary .",
    "the result is a superstatistical poisson - like process , generated by a family of deterministic chaotic mappings @xmath97 . in this way we can build up a formal mathematical framework to dynamically generate superstatistical poisson processes .",
    "we started this paper with experimental observations : the probability densities of daily rainfall amounts at a variety of locations on the earth are not gaussian or exponentially distributed , but follow an asymptotic power law , the @xmath0-exponential distribution .",
    "the corresponding entropic exponent @xmath0 is close to @xmath1 .",
    "the waiting time distribution between rainy episodes is observed to be close to an exponential distribution , but again a careful analysis shows that a @xmath0-exponential is a better fit , this time with @xmath0 close to 1.05 .",
    "we discussed the corresponding extreme value distributions , leading to gumbel and frchet distributions .",
    "we made contact with a very important concept that is borrowed from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics , the superstatistics approach , and pointed out how to generalize this concept to strongly mixing mappings that can generate langevin - like and poisson - like processes for which the corresponding variance or rate parameter fluctuates in a superstatistical way .",
    "of course rainfall is ultimately described by a very high dimensional and complicated spatially extended dynamical system , but simple model systems as discussed in this paper may help .",
