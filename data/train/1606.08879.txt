    "gravity governs the structure and evolution of the entire universe , and it is successfully described by einstein s general theory of relativity ( gr ) . in fact , the predictions of gr have been extremely well tested in the  local \" universe , both in the weak field limit ( as in the solar system ) and for strongly self - gravitating bodies in pulsar binary systems.@xcite nevertheless , gravity in its gr description remains the least understood of all forces , e.g. , resisting unification with quantum physics .",
    "in fact , gr assumes a classical description of matter that completely fails at the subatomic scales which govern the early universe . therefore ,",
    "despite the fact that gr represents the most successful theory of gravity to date , it is expected to break down at the smallest scales .",
    "alternative theories have been considered in order to encompass gr shortcomings by adopting a semi - classical scheme where gr and its positive results can be preserved.@xcite",
    "so , does gr hold in its most extreme limit ? or are alternative theories of gravity required to describe the observable universe ? these questions are at the heart of our understanding of modern physics .",
    "the largest deviations from gr are expected in the strongest gravitational fields around black holes ( bhs ) , where different theories of gravity make significantly different predictions .",
    "the recent detection of gravitational waves@xcite seems to indicate that even events associated with very strong gravitational fields , such as the merger of two stellar - mass bhs , fulfil the predictions of gr .",
    "this extremely exciting discovery calls for additional verification using observations in the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "in fact , astronomical observations and gravitational wave detectors may soon provide us with the opportunity to study bhs in detail , and to probe gr in the dynamical , non - linear and strong - field regime , where tests are currently lacking .",
    "although bhs are one of the most fundamental and striking predictions of gr , and their existence is widely accepted , with many convincing bh candidates in the universe , they remain one of the least tested concepts in gr : for instance , there is currently neither a direct evidence for the existence of an event horizon nor tests of bh physics in gr ( e.g.  no - hair \" theorem ) .",
    "so , are bhs just a mathematical concept , or are they real , observable astrophysical objects ?    in order to conduct tests of gr using bhs as astrophysical targets ,",
    "it is crucial to resolve with observations the gravitational sphere of influence of the bh , down to scales comparable to its event horizon .",
    "the characteristic size scale of a bh is set by its event horizon in the non - spinning case , the schwarzschild radius : @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the gravitational radius , @xmath4 is the bh mass , @xmath5 is the gravitational constant , @xmath6 is the speed of light .",
    "the angular size subtended by the schwarzschild radius for a bh at distance @xmath7 is : @xmath8 . for stellar - mass bhs",
    "( with @xmath010  @xmath9 ) , @xmath10 lies obviously well below the resolving power of any current telescope .",
    "supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) , which supposedly lie at the center of most galaxies , are several orders of magnitude larger , but they are at correspondingly much larger distances , resulting in their angular size to be generally too small to be resolved by any observing technique .",
    "but there is a notable exception : the center of our own galaxy , which hosts the closest and best constrained candidate smbh in the universe .",
    "this smbh is a factor of a million larger than any stellar - mass bh in the galaxy and at least thousand times closer than any other smbh in external galaxies , making it the largest bh on the sky and , therefore , a prime target for bh astrophysical studies and gr tests .    in this review ,",
    "we first summarise the observed physical properties of the smbh candidate in the galactic center (  [ sgra * ] ) .",
    "we then describe current experimental and theoretical efforts of the _ blackholecam _ project , which is funded by the european research council ( erc ) and is a partner of the _ event horizon telescope _ ( eht ) consortium .",
    "its main goals are to image the immediate surroundings of an event horizon as well as to understand the spacetime around a smbh ( both in gr and in alternative theories of gravity ) using stellar and pulsar orbits as probes (  [ gr_tests ] ) .",
    "we later argue that the combination of independent results from different experiments can lead to a quantitative and precise test of the validity of gr (  [ alltogether ] ) and effectively turn our galactic center into a cosmic laboratory for fundamental physics , enabling gravity to be studied in its most extreme limit (  [ summary ] ) . for detailed reviews of tests of gr in the galactic center",
    ", we refer to refs .  .",
    "the astronomical source suspected to be the smbh at the center of the galaxy was first detected in the radio as a point source named sagittarius a * ( sgr  a * ) , @xcite and has subsequently been studied across the full electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "what makes sgr  a * unique is its close proximity , only about 8 kpc,@xcite along with its large mass , about @xmath11  @xmath9.@xcite consequently , the physical properties of sgr  a * can be uniquely determined with a level of confidence not possible with other smbh candidates , making it the most compelling case for the existence of a smbh .",
    "here we summarise its main observational parameters : mass (  [ mass ] ) , spectrum (  [ spectrum ] ) , size (  [ size ] ) , and accretion rate (  [ acc ] ) . for full reviews ,",
    "see refs .  .",
    "the best evidence for a central dark mass of a few million solar masses comes from near - infrared ( nir ) studies with ground - based @xmath12-m class telescopes , where the development of adaptive optics has provided the ability to track the motions of individual stars orbiting around sgr  a * over several decades.@xcite so far , about 30 stellar orbits have been monitored in the center of our galaxy@xcite ( figure  [ fig : orbits ] , left panel ) .",
    "one of these stars ( s2 ) , with an orbital period of about 16 years and an orbital speed of about 10000  , has been followed for over one fully - closed orbit around the smbh,@xcite showing a textbook - like keplerian elliptical orbit ( figure  [ fig : orbits ] , middle and right panels ) .",
    "these measurements have provided a unique opportunity to map out the gravitational potential around sgr  a * with high precision,@xcite and demonstrated that this potential , in the central tenth of a parsec of the milky way , must be dominated by a single point source of a few million solar masses.@xcite the most precise measurement of the mass is yielded through combining measurements of stars orbiting about sgr  a * @xcite and in the old galactic nuclear star cluster:@xcite @xmath13 ( see ref .  ) .",
    "the final piece of evidence needed to associate the measured dark mass with sgr  a * is provided by its own peculiar motion , which is consistent with 0 ( @xmath14  ) , as measured with very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) using radio telescopes.@xcite when compared with the high velocities of the orbiting stars in the same region ( up to @xmath15 km / s ) , the implication is that at least 10% , if not all , of the dark mass must be associated with sgr  a*.@xcite    the distance to sgr  a * has also been accurately measured using both 3d velocities of orbiting stars measured with nir telescopes ( @xmath16  kpc ) @xcite and vlbi parallax measurements of molecular masers ( @xmath17  kpc).@xcite    put together , these measurements have provided the clearest evidence for the existence of a smbh at the center of our own galaxy , and of bhs in general .      despite the definition of a  _ black _ \" hole , there is nonetheless some information reaching us from near the event horizon in the form of electromagnetic radiation .",
    "indeed , gas and plasma around bhs are transported inwards through an accretion flow , which heats up the material and emits large amounts of energy .",
    "this energy is radiated across the entire electromagnetic spectrum from the radio , to infrared , optical , x - ray , and gamma - ray bands . since optical radiation from the galactic center",
    "is completely absorbed , the only observing bands where sgr  a * is clearly detected are the radio ( including sub - mm waves ) , the nir and mid - infrared ( mir ) , and x - rays ( e.g. , see figure  2 in ref .   for a broad - band spectrum of sgr  a * ) .    combining all radio data",
    ", one finds that the radio flux density @xmath18 increases slowly with frequency ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) and peaks at about @xmath21 ghz ( 0.3  mm).@xcite observing this synchrotron emission at sub - mm waves rather than at longer wavelengths brings a two - fold advantage : the emission becomes optically - thin and comes from smaller scales ( a typical property for self - absorbed synchrotron sources ) .",
    "were the first to realize that such a `` sub - mm bump '' in the spectrum of sgr  a * implies a scale of the order of several @xmath22 in diameter , and used this argument to suggest that the event horizon of sgr  a * could be imaged against the background of this synchrotron emission using vlbi at ( sub-)mm waves ( see  [ eht ] ) .",
    "determining the intrinsic size and structure of sgr  a * from direct imaging is difficult , and not only because of its small size .",
    "in fact , scattering of radio waves by electrons in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , between us and the galactic center , washes out any structure at long radio wavelengths,@xcite blurring sgr  a * into an east - west ellipse of axial ratio 2:1.@xcite the observed scatter - broadened angular size of sgr  a * follows a @xmath23 law @xcite ( see figure  [ fig : size ] , left panel ) : @xmath24    using a closure amplitude analysis , ref",
    ".   showed that the measured sizes of sgr  a * at 1.3  cm ( 22  ghz ) and 7  mm ( 43  ghz ) actually deviate from the predicted @xmath23 law , owing to the contribution of the intrinsic size , which seems to decrease with frequency .",
    "since the scattering effect reduces with increasing frequency , measurements at higher frequencies can more easily reveal such an intrinsic size .",
    "for instance , recently ref .   measured an intrinsic 2d source size of @xmath25 , at 3.5  mm ( 85  ghz ) .",
    "fitting data acquired up to 230  ghz , ref .",
    "report an intrinsic size of   @xmath26 at the wavelength of 1.3  mm ( 230 ghz ) , the angular size is 37  @xmath1as  ( figure  [ fig : size ] , right panel ) , which although very small , is within reach of the vlbi technique ( see  [ eht ] ) .",

    ".,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]      after the mass , the most important parameter of an astrophysical bh is its accretion rate , since it determines the level of activity .",
    "the best estimates of the accretion rate onto sgr  a * are provided by radio polarization measurements . in fact , the synchrotron radiation is typically linearly polarized , but the polarization vector rotates as the radio waves propagate through the magnetized ism , an effect called faraday rotation , which has a simple dependence on the wavelength : @xmath27 , where @xmath28   is the rotation measure ( rm ) which represents the overall strength of the effect , @xmath29 is the line - of - sight magnetic field ( in g ) , @xmath30 is the thermal electron density ( in @xmath31 ) , and @xmath32 is the path length ( in pc ) along the line - of - sight through the medium.@xcite the detection of strong linear polarization at ( sub-)mm wavelengths@xcite provided a rotation measure of @xmath33 rad m@xmath34,@xcite the highest value ever measured in any astronomical source . adopting this value and assuming a range of plausible density and magnetic field profiles , the accretion rate can be constrained to vary in the range @xmath35yr on scales of hundreds to thousands of r@xmath36 .",
    "@xcite      there are a few puzzling aspects regarding the physical properties of sgr  a * inferred from observations .",
    "firstly , the estimated value for the accretion rate is at least four orders of magnitude below the average accretion rate required to grow a four million solar mass bh in a hubble time .",
    "secondly , the radio luminosity of sgr  a * is well below the typical values observed in low - luminosity active galactic nuclei@xcite ( agn ) , indicating a remarkably low state in the activity level with respect to other smbhs in galaxies .",
    "thirdly , the amount of gas available for accretion around the bh would imply emission many orders of magnitude larger than observed ( e.g. , compare @xmath37  erg / sec to @xmath38  erg / sec ; see ref .  ) .",
    "this extremely low level of activity has led to competing models to explain the appearance of the emission from sgr  a * , which we discuss in next section .      since sgr",
    "a * is the closest smbh candidate , it is a natural testbed for accretion theories in agn . despite being the best - studied object of its kind ,",
    "the exact nature of its emission processes , dynamics , and geometry are still rather uncertain .    as already pointed out ,",
    "sgr  a * is highly underluminous , with a bolometric luminosity of @xmath39 times the eddington limit , which renders it an extreme case among the known population of agn . in this regime ,",
    "the emission is conventionally modelled as arising from a radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf).@xcite in such a model , the disk radiates inefficiently owing to low particle density which leads to a decoupling of electron and proton temperatures.@xcite the protons carry most of the mass ( i.e. of the energy ) , whereas the electrons produce most of the radiation ( via synchrotron , bremsstrahlung and inverse - compton processes ) . owing to this decoupling , most of the gravitational energy",
    "is viscously converted into thermal energy of the protons ( which cool inefficiently ) , and only a small fraction of the dissipated energy is transferred to the electrons via coulomb collisions and can be radiated away.@xcite since unlike for the electrons the radiative cooling is inefficient for protons , most of the gravitational energy released by viscous dissipation ( not radiated away by the electrons ) is _ advected _ by the accreting gas and swallowed by the bh , and one speaks of advection - dominated accretion flows ( adaf).@xcite    besides riaf , alternative mechanisms to reduce the radiative efficiency have been proposed .",
    "an interesting possibility is the reduction of the accretion rate via outflows . in the tradition of the adaf models,@xcite ref .",
    "proposed the adiabatic inflow - outflow solution ( adios ) model where the inflow / outflow rates decrease inward with decreasing radius according to @xmath40 , where @xmath41 .",
    "current dynamical models of the region near the bondi radius@xcite are consistent with values of the outflow index of @xmath42 , showing the importance of outflows in the dynamics of the galactic center .",
    "spectral modeling from radio to x - ray frequencies @xcite suggests an index of @xmath43 , although in order to fit the radio part of the spectrum by either the riaf or the adaf models , an additional contribution of hot electrons ( @xmath44 ) is required.@xcite this population is often assumed to be due to a jet emitted from the very inner parts of the accretion flow.@xcite    the current state - of - the art dynamical models of bh accretion are based on general relativistic magneto - hydrodynamic ( grmhd ) simulations@xcite that are typically initialized from a stationary rotating torus.@xcite if the torus contains a weak magnetic field , the magnetorotational instability ( mri)@xcite arises , which leads to self - consistent transport of angular momentum and mass accompanied by intermittent and unsteady outflows .",
    "@xcite in the presence of strong magnetic fields , a massive supply of ordered vertical magnetic flux builds - up near the bh until reaching saturation ; as a consequence , the mri is marginally suppressed and the accreting material enters the so - called magnetically arrested disk ( mad ) state.@xcite    .",

    "it is worth noting that , since different models of sgr  a * give different predictions for the appearance of the emission near the smbh , this may impact our ability to discern strong gravity effects .",
    "properly understanding the astrophysics is therefore crucial to investigate gravity on event horizon scales with astronomical techniques .",
    "based on the evidence summarized in  [ sgra * ] , we can now assess with great confidence that our galactic center hosts the most compelling candidate smbh in the universe , and therefore naturally provides a prime target for astronomical observations which aim to assess the existence of bhs , test gr in the strong - field regime , and , more generally , study the spacetime around a bh ( within gr and beyond ) .    in this section ,",
    "we describe three different types of ( on - going ) experiments to test gr with astronomical observations of sgr  a*. the first experiment aims to study sgr  a * on horizon scales by imaging the relativistic plasma emission which surrounds the event horizon and forms a _ shadow _ cast against the background , which can be resolved using vlbi techniques at mm - wavelengths (  [ shadow ] ) .",
    "the second experiment uses astrometric observations with nir interferometry , which are expected to resolve orbital precessions of stars orbiting sgr  a * as well as hot spots on the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) around the smbh , allowing measurements of the bh mass and spin (  [ stars ] ) .",
    "the third experiment relies on the detection and timing of radio pulsars in tight orbits around sgr  a * , which should reveal distinctive signatures in their orbits induced by the spin and quadrupole moment of sgr  a * , potentially providing the cleanest test of the _ no - hair _ theorem (  [ pulsars ] ) .",
    "although each type of observation may by itself lead to a measurement of the bh properties , it is effectively the cross - comparison of the predictions coming from different observational techniques that has the power to provide a fundamental test of gr (  [ alltogether ] ) . as argued later , ultimately , the results from all these measurements should be interpreted within a general theoretical framework for the bh spacetime , describing not only gr but also any possible alternative theory of gravity (  [ metrics ] ) .",
    "the defining feature of a bh is the event horizon , the boundary within which a particle ( or photon ) can not escape . as a consequence , bhs",
    "are completely _ black _ only within the event horizon , but outside r@xmath36   light can escape .",
    "in fact the matter accreting onto the bh heats up via viscous dissipation and converts gravitational energy into radiation (  [ astro_mod ] ) .",
    "_ so what would a bh actually look like , if one could observe it ? _ ref .",
    "was the first to calculate the visual appearance of a bh against a bright background , and found that it is determined by a region of spherical photon orbits .",
    "although the probability of a bh passing in front of a background source like a star is very small , ref .   and later ref .  , building on the work of ref .",
    ", showed that a bh embedded in an optically - thin emitting plasma ( like the one expected to surround sgr  a * ; see  [ spectrum ] ) , would produce a specific observable signature : a bright photon ring with a dim  _ shadow _ \" in its interior cast by the bh .",
    "the shadow is essentially an image of the photon sphere , lensed by the strong gravitational field around the bh and superimposed over the background light .",
    "owing to gravitational lensing , the size of the shadow is increased . in particular , compared to the angular radius of the bh horizon in a euclidean spacetime ( @xmath53=10  @xmath1as  at the distance of sgr a * of @xmath54 ; see  [ intro ] ) , relativistic calculations result in approximately a 2.5 times larger radius of the shadow .",
    "therefore the angular diameter of the shadow in the sky is @xmath050",
    "@xmath1as   as viewed from the earth .",
    "although very small , this angular size can actually be resolved by vlbi at mm - wavelengths ( see  [ eht ] ) , as first pointed out by ref .  .",
    "in gr , the intrinsic size of the shadow ( @xmath55 ) is mainly determined by the bh mass , while its shape depends strongly on its spin and inclination.@xcite for a non - spinning , spherically - symmetric bh , the shape of the shadow is a perfect circle . for a kerr bh ,",
    "the difference in the photon capture radius between corotating and counter - rotating photons ( with the corotating photons passing closer to the center of mass with increasing spin ) , creates a  dent \" on one side of the shadow which depends on the bh spin .",
    "moreover , the fact that photons passing on the counter - rotating side have to pass at larger distances than the co - rotating side ( to avoid being captured by the event horizon ) , results in the centroid of the shadow shifting significantly with respect to the mass center , resulting in crescent - like images.@xcite    besides the geometrical shape , the emission brightness distribution also strongly depends on spin and inclination , with e.g. high - inclination , high - spin configurations having a more compact , one - sided structure ( due to doppler beaming ) than low - spin , face - on configurations .",
    "therefore , imaging the bh shadow can in principle enable one to constrain the spin and the orientation in the sky of the bh .",
    "in addition , sophisticated grmhd models of the emission that include accretion disks and jets @xcite suggest that the observed emission morphology , besides gr beaming and lensing effects , depends also on the astrophysical model of the plasma flow . therefore , the appearance of the shadow could also be used to discriminate between different models of the mm emission ( e.g. , disk vs. jet ; see  [ astro_mod ] ) .",
    "finally , if the no - hair theorem is violated , the shape of the shadow can become asymmetric@xcite and its size may vary with parameters other than the bh mass , e.g. the bh quadrupole moment or generic parametric deviations from the kerr metric.@xcite imaging the bh shadow can in principle provide constraints on these deviation parameters . actually , since the shape of the shadow",
    "is set by the photon region , created by photons following ( spherical ) null geodesics in the spacetime around the bh , the morphology of the shadow is _ mainly _ determined by the theory of gravity assumed to govern the bh . since the first study by ref .",
    ", several groups have extended the calculations for the appearance of the bh shadow to a variety of spacetimes within gr and alternative theories of gravity ( see  [ shadow_image ] ) .",
    "therefore , bh shadow imaging experiments can test predictions for the properties of the shadow in alternative theories of gravity ( see  [ metrics ] ) .",
    "radio interferometry is an astronomical observing technique to obtain high - resolution images of radio sources . in particular",
    ", vlbi uses a global network of radio telescopes spread across different continents as an interferometer to form a virtually earth - sized telescope . by recording radio wave signals at individual antennas and afterwards cross - correlating the signals between all pairs of antennas _ post - facto _ ( using time stamps of atomic clocks for synchronization ) , one obtains the so - called interferometric _ visibilities",
    "_ , that can be used to reconstruct an image of the source using fourier transform algorithms.@xcite the achievable image resolution ( in radians ) of an interferometer is given by @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the observed wavelength and @xmath29 is the distance between the telescopes ( or baseline ) .",
    "hence , higher frequencies ( shorter wavelengths ) and longer baselines provide the highest resolving power .",
    "in fact , vlbi at mm wavelengths ( mm - vlbi ) offers the highest achievable angular resolution in ground - based astronomy , of the order of tens of microarcseconds  @xmath1as , was recently achieved at 1.3  mm ( or 230 ghz ) for a separation of @xmath589447 km between telescopes in hawaii and chile.@xcite using a space - based 10-m antenna , radioastron , a similar resolution was recently obtained also at longer radio wavelengths of 1.35cm.@xcite ] , which is sufficient to resolve the shadow cast by the bh in sgr  a * with an angular size on the sky of @xmath050  @xmath1as  ( see  [ definition ] ) .",
    "the first mm - vlbi observations of sgr  a *  were conducted at 7  mm ( or 43  ghz ) using four stations of the very long baseline array .",
    "although these provided evidence for source structure , they could not resolve the source with a synthesized beamsize of @xmath02  mas.@xcite subsequent experiments carried out at 3  mm ( or 90  ghz ) started to resolve the source @xcite as well as to show evidence of asymmetric structure.@xcite while observing at these relatively low frequencies is easier from a technical point of view ( see below ) , there are three main scientific motivations for pushing vlbi observations of sgr  a * towards higher frequencies , or shorter wavelengths of about 1  mm .",
    "first , the longest ( i.e. earth - sized ) baselines can provide an angular resolution of @xmath025 @xmath1as  at 1.3 mm , sufficient to resolve the shadow in sgr  a*. second , the intrinsic size of the emission from sgr  a * is larger at longer wavelengths,@xcite indicating that the observed emission is optically thick , obscuring the shadow near the bh for @xmath59  1  mm .",
    "third and most problematically , the blurring effect of the interstellar scattering dominates the size measurement at @xmath60  mm , while at 1.3 mm a point source would be scattered to @xmath61  @xmath1as , smaller ( although still significant ) with respect to the intrinsic source size ( 37  @xmath1as ; see  [ size ] ) .    while high frequencies are better suited to spatially resolving the bh shadow , mm - vlbi faces significant observational and technical challenges , i.e. higher data rates , higher stability required for atomic clocks and receiver chains , and , above all , the distortion effect of the wave fronts by the troposphere .",
    "moreover , telescopes operating at mm - wavelengths are hard to build , because their surface accuracy needs to be much smaller than the wavelength they measure ( i.e. @xmath62  1  mm ) . building large dishes ( @xmath63  10  m in diameter ) with such an accuracy is difficult .",
    "this explains why mm - vlbi experiments so far have been conducted with a limited number of stations ( 24 ) , providing a minimal set of baselines which produce too few visibilities to form a high - fidelity image using the usual fourier transform techniques.@xcite nevertheless , although the current data are too sparse for imaging , one can in principle use simulated images of the accretion flow to fit against the measured interferometric visibilities ( an example is shown in figure  [ fig : grmhd_models ] ) .",

    "after these first vlbi experiments with an intra - european baseline,@xcite the subsequent experiments were conducted at a wavelength of 1.3  mm ( 230  ghz ) with a three - station array ( in arizona , california , and hawaii ) . the first remarkable result obtained with such an array is the discovery of resolved structure in sgr  a * on scales of only 4  r@xmath36(@xmath040 @xmath1as ) , by measuring the correlated flux density as a function of projected baseline length.@xcite these initial measurements however did not allow an assessment of the exact nature of this structure or discrimination between gaussian and ring models ( the latter are motivated by the prediction of the shadow in front of the bh ) .",
    "besides measuring the source flux density at different baselines , which is sensitive to the source size , measurements of the closure phases can provide some basic information about the orientation and the structure of the source , and turned out to be quite constraining in ruling out various models .",
    "for instance , refs .   argue that face - on models are highly disfavoured by current data , which seem instead to indicate that the disk spin axis is highly inclined to line of sight ( but still exclude pure edge - on configurations ) . ref .",
    "have recently found that the median closure phase of sgr  a * is nonzero , conclusively demonstrating that the mm emission is asymmetric on scales of a few @xmath64 , as predicted by gr ( see  [ definition ] ) .",
    "in addition , ref .   demonstrated that this small - scale emission from sgr  a * is also time variable , as expected in a relativistic accretion flow .",
    "finally , ref .   performed vlbi measurements of the linearly polarized emission and found evidence for ( partially ) ordered magnetic fields near the event horizon , on scales of @xmath06 r@xmath36 .",
    "while this fitting technique in the fourier domain has already been quite successful , providing major breakthroughs , spatially - resolved images on event - horizon scales are clearly necessary for assessing the nature of complex structure surrounding the shadow as well as for unambiguously determining bh properties such as its spin and inclination .",
    "to reach the goal of imaging the bh shadow , the crucial point is that the array should include more than three antennas and the resulting baselines should include both east - west and north - south orientations across different continents . for this purpose , an international collaboration , including _",
    "blackholecam _ , is assembling the event horizon telescope ( eht ) , a mm - vlbi network of existing ( and up - coming ) mm - wavelength telescopes spread across several continents to form a global interferometer .",
    "currently , the eht operates at a wavelength of 1.3  mm ( @xmath0230 ghz ) and in the near future the vlbi capability may become available at higher frequencies ( @xmath0350 ghz).@xcite a critical element in the implementation of this plan is the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) , which is the most sensitive ( sub)mm - wave telescope ever built and consists of 50 individual antennas of 12-m diameter .",
    "the inclusion of alma as a phased - array will enable a transformative leap in capabilities , including unprecedented sensitivity and greatly improved image fidelity thanks to the north - south baseline.@xcite joint vlbi observations that include alma as a phased array with other telescopes worldwide will start in 2017 .      in order to use the interferometric image of the bh shadow to reveal potential deviations from the kerr metric ( see  [ metrics ] and [ shadow_image ] ) , we need to measure the fractional asymmetry of the shadow shape with respect to its angular size to the few percent level . to achieve this goal",
    ", it is crucial to define the accuracy with which the bh shadow can be measured with the eht .",
    "this requires a fundamental understanding of both the intrinsic properties of the source as well as the corruptions along the signal path , from the intervening ism to correlator output .",
    "furthermore , the efficacy of calibration and image reconstruction algorithms must be clearly understood and appropriately employed .",
    "all these components have both statistical and systematic uncertainties that need to be quantified to ensure a robust analysis .",
    "* sources of uncertainties .",
    "* an important source of uncertainty stems from the assumption that the intrinsic mm - wave sky brightness distribution of sgr  a * is not time - variable at sub - mas scales . in reality",
    ", variations in the accretion flow render the source variable on timescales comparable to the period of the isco , ranging from a few minutes ( for a maximally rotating kerr bh ) to about half an hour ( for a schwarzschild bh ) .",
    "the challenge is that a source that is time - variable within the observation length breaks a simplifying assumption typically used for standard earth - rotation aperture - synthesis imaging , upon which vlbi is based.@xcite recent simulations of realistic eht observations have nevertheless demonstrated that an image of the bh shadow can still be recovered by observing over multiple days and imaging the concatenated dataset , by effectively scaling the visibility amplitudes using the shortest baselines in the array.@xcite while this technique improves the image fidelity and dynamic range , it effectively averages out much of the information measured by the longest baselines as a trade - off .",
    "an interesting opportunity is that some of this variability may be dominated by a single blob of material accreting onto the bh , and one could in principle track such a  hot spot \" over many orbits within a single observing run , using it as a test particle to probe the kerr spacetime using both closure quantities and/or direct imaging@xcite ( see also  [ stars ] ) .",
    "in addition to intrinsic source variability , the refractive substructure of ism inhomogeneities impose an apparent time variability ( with a characteristic timescale of about one day ) .",
    "this is mitigated to a degree if data are collected over a period of time longer than the refractive timescale , resulting in what is known as the _ ensemble - average_.@xcite this ensemble - average suffers from angular broadening due to the ism , but the scattering properties are largely deterministic over most of the relevant range of baseline - lengths and wavelengths .",
    "as such , ref .",
    "have applied a reconstruction algorithm to a simulated eht image that included scatter - broadening@xcite and demonstrated that the ism blurring is invertible to a degree .",
    "another potential cause of uncertainty is the unknown structure of the accretion flow of sgr  a * ( see  [ astro_mod ] ) .",
    "although the accreting plasma could have density and magnetic field gradients both along and across the accretion disk , or even include a jet or a wind , we expect these uncertainties to play only a minor role , because the size and shape of the shadow are mainly determined by the spacetime ( see  [ shadow_image ] ) .",
    "the image reconstruction will finally be affected by statistical and systematic errors that stem from eht data calibration , largely due to instrumental and atmospheric effects . in early vlbi observations with a three - station array ,",
    "the ( relative ) amplitude calibration uncertainty was estimated to be around 5%.@xcite for larger eht arrays , one could use individual phased - interferometers ( alma , sma , noema ) , which , besides the beam - formed data stream , may also simultaneously record local interferometric data at @xmath00.01 - 1  arcsec angular resolution .",
    "this enables calibration of the amplitude scale across the array under the assumption that the source flux is dominated by the sub - mas emission .",
    "even more critical is the accurate calibration of the visibility phases , given that they carry the information on the spatial structure of the accretion flow . at mm wavelengths the effect of the troposphere on the visibility phases is significant , resulting in a  coherence \" time that is typically 10 seconds at mm wavelengths and preventing the coherent time averaging on longer timescales",
    "this ultimately limits the ability to perform highly accurate phase calibration due to the troposphere - induced signal - to - noise limit .    in order to gain a deep understanding of how these effects impact eht observations and the robustness of any scientific inference that may result , it is clear that a detailed instrument simulator is required .",
    "* tying measurements to theory : the need for realistic mm - vlbi simulators . * as mentioned above , measuring the shape of the bh shadow at the few percent level requires prior knowledge , at a comparable level , of all the sources of uncertainty that affect the observations .",
    "in addition , radio interferometers , and in particular vlbi arrays which have relatively few individual stations , do not sample all spatial frequencies on the sky .",
    "therefore , an image generated from an interferometric observation does not necessarily represent the full sky brightness distribution .",
    "understanding all of the above effects to the required level of detail necessitates the simulation of the full signal path , quantifying all systematic contributions on the data products in particular ( i.e. observed visibilities , closure quantities , reconstructed images ) .",
    "this _ instrument simulator _ can tie theoretical models to instrument measurements , by providing a framework to convert astrophysical model images / parameters ( e.g. from grmhd simulations ) into simulated visibilities with realistic signal corruptions .",
    "the key point is to extract bh parameters , and therefore compare theoretical models directly from eht visibilities .    for this purpose , in _ blackholecam _ we are adopting the interferometry simulation software meqtrees,@xcite initially developed for low - frequency interferometers ( lofar and ska ) .",
    "meqtrees is a simulation and calibration package for building so - called  measurement equation trees\".@xcite the visibilities measured by the interferometer are expressed using a chain of jones matrices@xcite whose individual terms describe various independent instrumental and physical effects affecting the astronomical signal .",
    "the user can simulate any interferometric observation , by specifying the antenna configuration , observing frequency , instantaneous bandwidth , start time , etc .",
    "the individual jones terms in the measurement equation then enable a simulation of the signal propagation and hence measured visibilities .",

    "@xcite meqsilhouette contains a series of components ( or modules ) , including : a basic input module to convert theoretical model images into a _ sky _ model ( which can be time - variable ) , a physically realistic approximation of both the mean and turbulent troposphere , a full treatment of time - variable ism scattering , as well as time - variable antenna pointing errors ( which are non - negligible relative to the station primary beams at mm wavelengths ) . in the future",

    "the absence of a quantum theory of gravity as part of a grand unified theory of all fundamental forces has resulted in the formulation of several alternative theories of gravity . in particular , we focus here on a class known as _",

    "it is well known that such metric theories of gravity are built and classified according to the types of fields they contain , and the modes of interaction through those fields . since they are strictly dependent of the field equation and because of the large number of alternative theories of gravity , including the possibility that the `` true '' theory is still unknown , it is reasonable to develop a model - independent framework which parametrises the most generic bh geometry through a finite number of adjustable quantities .",
    "these quantities must be chosen in such a way that they can be used to measure deviations from the general - relativistic bh geometry ( kerr metric ) and could be estimated from the observational data.@xcite this approach is similar in spirit to the parametrized post - newtonian approach ( ppn ) which describes the spacetime far from the source of strong gravity.@xcite the main advantage of this approach is that different theories of gravity can be constrained at once .",

    "however , this can not be separated from the much larger secular lense - thirring precession .",

    "the methods described above require that the motion of the pulsar around sgr  a * is mainly affected by the smbh gravitational field , and external perturbations are negligible compared to the gr effects . as in the case of the s - stars ,",
    "the pulsar orbit can experience external perturbations , for example from neighbouring stars or dark matter , which would lead to an additional precession of the orbit , which can not be quantified a priori.@xcite external perturbations are generally expected to be more prominent near apoapsis , when the gravitational effects from the smbh are weaker and the pulsar motion is slower . on the other hand , in a highly eccentric orbit ( @xmath87 relativistic effects related to the gravitational field of the bh are most prominent around periapsis , where external effects are much more likely to be negligible.@xcite consequently , there is considerable hope that even in the presence of external perturbations , relevant information on the smbh parameters ( mass , spin , and quadrupole moment ) can still be extracted reliably , by taking only the small fraction of the orbit near the periapsis .",
    "in fact , ref .   has demonstrated this in fully consistent mock data simulations .",

    "this , in turn , may yield some of the most accurate tests of bhs in gr and in alternative theories and probe a completely new parameter space .",
    "but even in the presence of external perturbations , pulsar timing still has the potential to measure mass , spin and quadrupole moment of sgr  a * with good precision , by exploiting the characteristic timing residuals caused by the different relativistic effects during periapsis passages .",
    "observational and theoretical considerations suggest the presence of a large number of neutron stars in the inner parsec of the galaxy , with up to 100 normal pulsars and 1000 millisecond pulsars , while normal pulsars have average periods of 0.5 to @xmath90 ( e.g. , see refs .  , and references therein ) .    despite concentrated efforts to survey the central few tens of parsecs,@xcite and the immediate vicinity ( @xmath91 ) of sgr  a@xmath92 itself,@xcite the number of pulsars discovered at the beginning of 2013 within @xmath93 of sgr  a@xmath92 was only five.@xcite this deficit",
    "was explained by severe interstellar scattering , which leads to temporal broadening of the pulses .",
    "this effect renders a pulsar essentially undetectable if the scattering time exceeds the pulse period ; as was thought to be the case at typical search frequencies of around one to two ghz . since the pulse scattering time scale , @xmath94 , is a strong function of radio observing frequency , @xmath95 , where typically @xmath96 , the strategy was therefore to conduct searches at increasing radio frequencies .",
    "the penalty associated with high frequency searches is , however , a severe drop in flux density due to the steep spectra of pulsars ( average spectral index of @xmath97 ) .",
    "the situation changed somewhat in april 2013 , when radio emission from a transient magnetar was detected in the galactic center.@xcite the source , now known as psr  j1745@xmath982900 , is located 2@xmath994 ( or 0.1 pc ) from sgr  a*,@xcite which is within the bondi - hoyle accretion radius .",
    "the angular scatter broadening of the source is consistent with that of sgr  a*,@xcite while the rotation measure is by far the largest for any galactic object ( apart from sgr  a * itself).@xcite the dispersion measure is also the largest for any known pulsar , and the probability of a chance alignment with sgr  a@xmath92 is exceedingly small,@xcite all together providing evidence for the proximity of the magnetar ( in 3d ) to the galactic center .",
    "moreover , the proper motion of the pulsar is similar to the motion of massive stars orbiting sgr  a * in a clockwise disk.@xcite the predicted orbital period of psr  j1745@xmath982900 is @xmath0700  yr , however the full 3d orbital motion around the central smbh can be confirmed by measurements of acceleration in the proper motion.@xcite    detecting the line - of - sight acceleration from pulsar timing measurements is unlikely because psr  j1745@xmath982900 is a magnetar ; a slowly - rotating pulsar ( period @xmath03.76  s ) with a strong magnetic field ( in excess of @xmath100 g ) .",
    "such objects can not be used for precision timing experiments owing to their rotational instability and variable pulse profile shape.@xcite nevertheless , its detection suggests that a hidden pulsar population may be present .",
    "in fact , radio emitting magnetars are a rare type of neutron star  yr vs. @xmath101  yr for normal pulsars , which explains their rarity . ] with only three radio - loud magnetars previously known to exist in the galaxy .",
    "therefore the discovery of such an uncommon pulsar next to sgr  a * supports the hypothesis that many more ordinary radio pulsars should be present .",
    "a surprising ( but fortunate ) implication of the magnetar discovery was that the pulse scatter broadening is effectively a factor of 1000 smaller than predicted:@xcite in fact , with a pulse period of 3.76  s , its radio emission should not be detectable at frequencies as low as 1.1  ghz , if hyper - strong scattering , as predicted in refs .",
    ", were indeed present .",
    "a potential explanation is that the medium is highly turbulent ( i.e. , there is a lot of  weather \" ) , resulting in a highly variable scattering , therefore the pulsars may be present but not detectable all the time.@xcite another possibility is that the scattering towards the magnetar may not be representative of the entire galactic center region , and stronger scattering could be present in other parts : i.e. , the line - of - sight to sgr  a * could still be plagued with hyper - strong scattering as predicted in refs .",
    ". even if the latter is true , there are reasons to be optimistic for pulsar searches of the galactic center at high radio frequencies because of the strong inverse frequency dependence of pulse scatter broadening ( at high frequencies pulse scattering can be neglected@xcite ) .    however , finding pulsars at such frequencies is intrinsically difficult , as their flux density decreases steeply with increasing frequency .",
    "so far , the number of pulsars detected at very high frequencies is rather small ( nine at 32 ghz , four at 43 ghz and one at 87 ghz).@xcite psr  j1745@xmath982900 is an exception , owing to a very flat flux density spectrum , which has allowed its detection from a few ghz up to 225 ghz , which is the highest frequency at which a radio pulsar has been observed to date.@xcite the detection of pulsars at high frequencies has been mainly limited by the sensitivity of available mm - telescopes , but with the advent of next - generation mm - observatories , such as the lmt , phased - noema , and phased - alma ( see  [ eht ] ) , the hunt for pulsars around sgr  a * will enter a new phase .",
    "this next - generation instruments will provide sufficiently high sensitivity to allow the first systematic survey for pulsars at frequencies of about 90  ghz ( or higher ) in the galactic center.@xcite      in previous sections , we have described the prospects of measuring the properties of the smbh in the galactic center and its spacetime using three types of observations : the bh shadow with the eht , stars orbiting sgr  a * with gravity , and pulsars with alma ( and other telescopes ) .",
    "although each type of observation is sensitive to ( different ) relativistic effects and may lead by itself to a measurement of the bh properties , it is only by combining the three techniques that it will be possible to assess systematics and quantify uncertainties in each measurement , leading to a precise , quantitative test of the validity of gr .",
    "there are a number of reasons .",
    "firstly , each measurement uses a very different observational technique ( mm - vlbi images of synchrotron emission , stellar astrometry with nir interferometry , pulsar timing with radio telescopes ) and is , therefore , affected by very different systematics , which can be more easily identified by comparing results from the three methods .",
    "secondly , any difference in the measurements of the bh mass , spin , or quadrupole moment , from the three methods , can define the precision of these measurements .",
    "thirdly , and most importantly , each type of observation is expected to lead to correlated uncertainties ( or degeneracies ) between the bh spin and quadrupole moment ( e.g. , see figure  [ fig : pwk16_pulsars ] in the case of pulsars ) , as well as between the spin and potential deviations from the kerr geometry ( see e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "the combination of different methods can in fact break this degeneracy and therefore lead to independent estimates of the bh parameters and to a clean test of the kerr metric .",
    "this has been demonstrated by ref .  , who show that the correlated uncertainties in the measurements of the spin and quadrupole moment using the orbits of stars and pulsars are along different directions in the parameter space to those obtained from measuring the shape and size of the shadow with vlbi imaging .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : pwk16_all ] which shows the bayesian likelihood of simulated measurements of the spin and quadrupole moment for a kerr bh ( similar to the plot shown in figure  [ fig : pwk16_pulsars ] ) with the three methods : eht imaging of the bh shadow , gravity observations of two stars , and timing observations of three periapsis passages of a pulsar.@xcite remarkably , the contours of the gravity and pulsar - timing observations are nearly orthogonal to the contours of the eht measurements , reducing the uncertainty of a combined measurement significantly .",
    "it is interesting to note that while pulsars ( and stars ) probe the far - field ( 100s1000s  @xmath3 ) , the shadow image probes the near - field ( @xmath10210s  @xmath3 ) .",
    "both observations must nevertheless fit in the same model : it should be possible to predict the bh image from pulsar observations and then compare it with the vlbi measurements .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig3_erc ] , where we show two projected precessing pulsar orbits and the resulting timing residuals together with the expected vlbi images for two bh spin - orientations ( face - on and edge - on , respectively ) .",
    "both configurations have distinctive signatures in the image and in the timing , thereby over - constraining the model .",
    "any difference between imaging , gr modeling , and pulsar timing will thus indicate the precision of the measurement of sgr  a * s mass and spin .",
    "an independent third measurement could come from gravity and eventually all three methods should intersect for a proper theory .",
    "in fact , it could be the case that only the combination of the far - field measurements based on pulsars and stars , with the near field tests from imaging , has the power to reveal a deviation from kerr .",
    "this has been the subject of a recent study by ref .  , who showed that the near - field image by itself might not be able to detect a deviation from kerr ( as an illustration , see their figure 5a ) .",
    "however , once the spin measurement from the pulsar done in the kerr - like far field is combined with the constraints from modeling the shadow , one can recover the deformation ( in their case , parameter @xmath103 ) , and test for a violation of the kerr hypothesis .    in summary ,",
    "although the measurement of spacetime around a bh from each type of observation will be ground - breaking in itself , it is only the cross - comparison of the predictions from different methods that has the power to provide a fundamental test of gr , and therefore lead to a true breakthrough .",
    "gr has just turned 100 years old , and yet no other theory of gravity is equally successful at describing the complex phenomenology that astronomical and cosmological observations provide , both on the smallest scales of the solar system and on the largest cosmological scales .",
    "in fact , gr has successfully passed all tests carried out both in the weak field limit ( as in the solar system ) and for strongly self - gravitating bodies in pulsar binary systems .",
    "while these tests have confirmed gr as the standard theory of gravity , tests in the strong field regime are still missing .",
    "the strongest gravitational fields are expected to be around bhs , especially smbhs . therefore the most promising tests of gr are those aiming to probe the spacetime around smbhs , where the largest deviations from gr are expected and/or alternative theories of gravity may apply .    while there are many bh candidates in the universe ,",
    "the most compelling evidence for the existence of a smbh is provided by the radio source sgr  a * in the center of our own galaxy . with its large mass of @xmath104  @xmath9  and at a distance of only @xmath105  kpc , sgr  a * is the prime target for bh and gr experimental studies .",
    "the main goal of _ blackholecam _ is to conduct gr tests in a strong - field regime that has not been explored directly so far , using three different types of observations of sgr  a * across the electromagnetic spectrum with new - generation instruments .",
    "the first experiment consists of making a standard astronomical image of the accretion flow around sgr  a*. at its center , gr predicts the appearance of a bh  shadow \" , which is a gravitationally lensed image of the photon capture sphere and has a diameter of about 5  r@xmath36@xmath050  @xmath1as  ( as seen from earth ) .",
    "the plasma accreting onto the smbh radiates synchrotron emission that peaks at ( sub)mm waves and it is optically thin , thus mm - vlbi observations can enable us to see the innermost reaches of an event horizon .",
    "the eht , a virtually earth - sized telescope which uses the mm - vlbi technique , is being assembled at the moment , and will soon achieve the resolving power to finally resolve horizon scales and make an image of the shadow cast by the smbh at the galactic center .",
    "this will not only provide convincing evidence about the existence of an event horizon ( and therefore of bhs ) , but since the size and the shape of the shadow depend primarily on the underlying spacetime ( besides the basic bh parameters - see below ) , it will also provide a first - order test of the validity of gr and/or alternative theories of gravity ( which also predict bhs and shadows ) . in order to carry out such a strong - field test , in _ blackholecam",
    "_ we are building an appropriate theoretical framework to model both the spacetime in generic theories of gravity as well as the emission and dynamics of the plasma near the bh with grmhd simulations . by comparing shadow images from eht observations with model predictions",
    ", we aim to measure deviations from gr and thus test it against alternative theories of gravity in the strong field cases .",
    "while making the first image of a bh will be a breakthrough discovery , it will not be sufficient _ by itself _ to provide a precision test of gr .",
    "in fact , the shadow s properties depend on both the bh parameters and its spacetime , resulting in an inherent degeneracy between e.g. the bh spin and the deviation parameters of a given kerr - like metric .",
    "it then becomes key to reduce the free parameters by determining the bh parameters ( mass , spin , inclination ) _ independently _ from the imaging .",
    "we plan to do this by monitoring stellar orbits with the forthcoming nir interferometer at the vlt , gravity , which can detect orbital precessions induced by relativistic effects like the frame - dragging , enabling a measurement of the spin of sgr  a*. since the uncertainty on the latter is correlated with that of the quadrupole moment , a further independent measurement is required to break the degeneracy .    the third method is provided by radio observations of pulsars , which are thought to populate the galactic center . by timing a pulsar on a tight orbit ( period @xmath1021 year ) around sgr  a * , we may detect distinctive signatures of a number of relativistic and precessional effects , potentially allowing us to determine the bh s mass to one part in a million , its spin to tenths of a percent , and the quadrupole moment to a few percent , respectively .",
    "the recent detection of a magnetar at 0.1 pc from sgr  a * has renewed hopes of finding a pulsar in tight orbit around sgr  a * , and future surveys at high frequencies with alma hold the promise to achieve that .",
    "a last point worth stressing is that since the observables of the experiments described here are very different and are therefore subject to different systematics , the _ combination _ of three _ independent _ measurements would provide a very convincing case , resulting either in an increase in our confidence in the validity of gr in the strong - field regime , or in very serious consequences for the foundations of the theory .",
    "ultimately , such experiments should help us assess which theory of gravity best describes the astrophysical observations , and thus the observable universe .    in conclusion",
    ", the combination of event - horizon imaging and bh modeling , along with pulsar timing and stellar dynamics , can now transform the galactic center into a precision - astrophysics and fundamental - physics laboratory for testing gr in its most extreme limits , allowing us to explore the fine structure of the fabric of spacetime in any metric theory of gravity .",
