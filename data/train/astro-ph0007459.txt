    "spatial patterns originating from the polymorphic aggregation of matter in nature occur on vastly different length  scales and with unlimited variety .",
    "the pattern shown in figure [ fig : gal ] displays an isodensity contour of the smoothed galaxy distribution in our universe , but it could also represent a biological structure obtained with x  ray tomography , for instance .",
    "+ the visual impression of such patterns may already convey valuable insights on the formation processes or the functionality of those structures .",
    "however , for unbiased inferences as well as for comparison with model simulations , for example , one needs objective and quantitative measures to characterize the geometry and topology of typical structural motifs .",
    "+ in the present paper we discuss a family of suitable measures , which include , besides the scalar minkowski functionals , their vectorial relatives  the curvature centroids , or querma vectors . taken together , these measures constitute a complete class of morphometric order  parameters for spatial patterns formed  or approximated  by the set union and intersection of an arbitrary but finite number of convex `` pixels '' or `` voxels '' .",
    "+ the usefulness of minkowski functionals has already been demonstrated by the analysis of galaxy catalogues and simulations of large  scale structure  @xcite , as well as of the temperature distribution in maps of the microwave background radiation  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they were used to characterize the morphology of spinodal decomposition  @xcite and of patterns arising within reaction  diffusion systems  @xcite . here",
    ", we focus attention on the less familiar querma vectors and illustrate their versatility with the examples of galaxy clusters and with patterns generated by lattice automata .",

    "these parameters display the imprint of subclumps , the symmetry and shift of the curvature centroid @xmath71 and are the larger the more substructure the cluster exhibits .",
    "as visible from table  [ tab : tauopen ] , the cluster @xmath72cdm owns more substructure with respect to clumpiness and symmetry . a statistical comparison of these descriptors for larger numbers of clusters simulated in different models yields a typical cluster morphology and",

    "the area of the union set of balls inside the window @xmath76 increases almost linearly with @xmath85 .",
    "a homogenous galaxy distribution would yield a parabolic dependence , but here the galaxy density drops at larger scales .",
    "the small peaks in the euler characteristic typically arise when two parts of a connected subcluster enter the window simultaneously .",
    "+ the curvature centroids are more sensitive to geometrical anisotropies .",
    "the components @xmath88 are depicted in figure [ fig : rc_box_p ] .",
    "two features are clearly visible : the centroids vary when the sampling window grows and , at a fixed scale of the window , significant differences between the curvature centroids arise . the variation of the centroids is clearly correlated with subclusters entering the window , e.g. the wandering of @xmath89 and @xmath90 towards higher @xmath91values reflects the large cluster component in positive @xmath91direction of the center .",
    "+ to analyze the morphology of this cluster more in detail , we simulate a reference model for comparison . the simplest way to generate a reference cluster",
    "is an inhomogeneous , but spherically symmetric poisson process  @xcite .",
    "we determine the projected density profile of the cluster non  parametrically around the center of mass using a binning , and simulate @xmath92 poisson clusters using this profile ( the method for simulating inhomogeneous point processes is described e.g. in  @xcite ) .",

    "fluctuations as well as the results for the real cluster are depicted in figure [ fig : poissonvgl ] .",
    "+ the scalar minkowski functionals deviate only slightly from the poisson model .",
    "on the other hand , the curvature centroids reveal significant deviations ( second row of figure  [ fig : poissonvgl ] ) ; in particular , the @xmath93component of @xmath90 ( right panel ) is shifted away from the true center of mass for relatively small values of the window scale , reflecting the fact , that there are more galaxies above than beneath the cluster center .     to strengthen our conclusions we also simulated the poisson clusters with a different binning , but the results remained stable .",
    "the results demonstrate that the cluster cl0016 + 161 exhibits evidential subclustering in comparison with a poissonian model .",
    "the examples discussed in this note support our claim that the method of cluster analysis based on the combination of scalar minkowski functionals with vectorial centroids furnishes a versatile set of order parameters to sort out essential aspects of cluster morphology such as symmetry , clumpiness , global shape and topology .",
    "our cluster morphometry rests on a solid mathematical basis derived from a few reasonable requirements . in this sense",
    ", it allows for a unique morphological description .",
    "the construction of patterns from empirical data introduces additional parameters which may be employed advantageously for scale  specific diagnosis .",
    "no tacit statistical assumptions are involved .",
