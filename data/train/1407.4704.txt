    "the study of the structure of compact stars requires the understanding of the equation of state describing the stellar matter under extreme conditions .",
    "it has be pointed out that most of the current equations of state describing quark matter are too soft and so unable to explain the existence of massive neutron stars @xcite .",
    "only stiff equations of state describing normal nuclear matter at high densities would be capable of explaining the stability of high compact star masses ( @xmath0 ) . thus , apparently these observational data tend to favor the existence of matter without deconfined quarks in the interior of neutron stars .",
    "examples of massive compact stars are the isolated neutron star rx j1856.5 - 3754 @xcite , some low - mass x - ray binaries , e.g. , 4u 1636 - 536 @xcite , and the neutron star j0751 + 1807 ( @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "more recently , two possible pairs of values of mass and radius have been attributed to neutron star exo 1745 - 248 , one of them centered around @xmath2 with radius @xmath3 , and the other one centered around @xmath4 and with a smaller radius @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the neutron star in the low - mass x - ray binary 4u 1608 - 52 has a mass determined as @xmath6 and radius @xmath7 @xcite . regarding the neutron star exo @xmath8 , the obtained lower limits on the mass and radius are : @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite , even though these results are still unclear @xcite .",
    "it is believed that at high densities the strange quark matter is a more stable configuration than the ordinary nuclear matter @xcite and hence it is claimed that neutron stars would be stellar objects entirely or partially composed of strange quark matter @xcite , that is , a quark star or a hybrid star .",
    "however , some used equations of state describing quark matter are too soft to support quark stars with large masses and then , in this scenario , quark stars or hybrid stars seem to be incompatible with the observed massive neutron stars mentioned above .",
    "in fact , calculations using soft equations of state for quark matter provide values of maximum masses for hybrid neutron stars around @xmath11 , and lower values of maximum masses for strange quark stars .",
    "stiff equations of state of quark matter can be obtained when effects of strong interaction are taken into account @xcite .",
    "calculations of compact star models using quark matter equation of state , generated by modified mit bag model ( including perturbative corrections to qcd ) or by the nambu - jona - lasinio model , are in general capable of reproducing a maximum star mass around @xmath12 , which is compatible with the observational data @xcite .",
    "a recent calculation for cold and dense qcd strange quark matter including corrections to order @xmath13 indicates that massive compact stars with mass @xmath14 up to maximal masses @xmath15 would be interpreted as possible candidates for strange quark stars , @xmath16 , compact stars composed entirely of deconfined @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 quarks , and that compact stars with observed masses up to @xmath20 would be identified with hybrid stars , neutron stars with a central core made up of deconfined quark matter @xcite .",
    "motivated by these recent investigations , in this work we study the color superconducting quark matter by using a phenomenological model , namely the density - dependent quark mass model @xcite , in order to describe the strange quark star structure . assuming the cfl phase is the ground state of strange quark matter , we consider the effects of the cfl gap energy on the global strange quark star structure .",
    "the density - dependent quark mass model provides stiff equations of state , and hence large quark star masses can be obtained with this type of equations of state , which are compatible with some of those observational data , if reasonable values for the equation of state parameters are used .",
    "note that these results contrast with the mass - radius relationships predicted by equations of state constructed with descriptions of quark matter based on a simple version of the mit bag model , as discussed in ref .",

    "in the last few years the study of color superconducting phase in quark - gluon plasma @xcite has been attracting a great interest in discussing the possible states of quark matter . at qcd perturbative regime",
    "the attractive quark interaction introduces instabilities in the fermi surface , producing a gap in the quasiparticle energy spectrum .",
    "the color and flavor symmetries of three - flavor qcd are hence broken down , leading to the formation of pairs of quarks ( this mechanism is analogous to the electron pairing in the ordinary electric superconducting phenomenon ) .",
    "the quark matter becomes a color superconductor , with equal number of quarks for the three flavors @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 in an electrically neutral phase called color - flavor locked ( cfl ) @xcite .",
    "the color superconducting gap is included in an additional energy term to the thermodynamic potential associated to a quasi - free quark system as it is done elsewhere ( see for example the review article @xcite ) .    in order to describe the color - flavor locked phase composed of free quarks @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 at zero temperature we use the thermodynamic potential density given by @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 stand for the constituent quark masses , with @xmath28 . in this equation ,",
    "the first term in the right - hand side gives the contribution of degenerate quarks to the thermodynamic potential density , and the second one is the first order contribution from the quasiparticle energy gap , which reads @xmath29 where the quark chemical potential and the common fermi momentum @xmath30 , considering @xmath31 , are given respectively by @xmath32 and @xmath33 ^{1/2 } \\label{nufermi }   .\\ ] ]    the above common fermi momentum of the quark system depends on the mass of the three light quark flavors , and it does minimize the thermodynamic potential given by eq .",

    "note that for @xmath34 , one recovers the expression @xmath35 derived e.g. by rajagopal and wilczek @xcite , who have considered massless up and down quarks , and the nonzero current mass of the strange quark in the calculations .    in the @xmath36 phase described here ,",
    "the three flavors of quarks satisfy the following conditions : ( @xmath37 ) they have equal fermi momenta , which minimizes the free energy of the system @xcite ; ( @xmath38 ) they have equal number densities @xmath39 , as a consequence of the first condition , which means that @xmath40 and @xmath41 , for @xmath28 ; ( @xmath42 ) the quark system has neutral electromagnetic charge in bulk , as a direct consequence of the previous condition .    in the density - dependent quark mass model @xcite the masses of the three lightest quarks scale",
    "inversely with the baryon number density , namely : @xmath43 where @xmath21 is interpreted as the constant energy density in the zero quark density limit , and is analogous to the qcd vacuum energy density present in the mit bag model , and @xmath44 is the baryon number density expressed in terms of the quark number densities @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . the current mass of the strange quark , @xmath22 , enters as a parameter of the model .",
    "the dependence of the quark masses on the baryon density mimics the quark interaction at different values of density , incorporating the effect of quark interactions in the model .",
    "througt this artifact , the density - dependent quark mass model recovers the asymptotic behavior of quark matter predicted by qcd at high densities , namely , the quark asymptotic freedom and the dynamical confinement of quarks for low density regime as natural limit situations . consequently , in this model quarks are dynamically massive , and thus chiral symmetry of the qcd lagrangian is dynamically broken .",
    "besides , as mentioned previously , it would be unrealistic adopting vanishing dynamical quark masses to describe quark matter for the range of densities currently accepted for the interior of compact stars @xcite .",
    "the pressure derived from the thermodynamic potential in equation ( [ potential ] ) thus reads @xmath48    the term @xmath49 in the right - hand side of the last equation arises from the thermodynamic consistence between the degenerate quark gas pressure and the thermodynamic potential , due to the dependence of the quark mass on the baryon density .",
    "the additional term @xmath49 is similar to qcd vacuum pressure present in the mit bag model .",
    "the presence of this term enables a smooth model transition from the quark confinement regime to the asymptotic freedom since its explicitly form , @xmath50 is a decreasing function of the baryon density .",
    "we thus found the following explicit expression for the pressure : @xmath51 + \\frac{3}{\\pi ^{2}}(\\nu ^{3}\\mu   + \\delta_{cfl}^{2 } \\mu^{2}),\\ ] ] where the functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 are given by @xmath54 -x(x^{2}+1)^{1/2}(2x^{2}+1),\\ ] ] and @xmath55 -x(x^{2}+1)^{1/2},\\ ] ] with @xmath56 defined by @xmath57    finally , the energy density can be obtained from the thermodynamic relation @xmath58 from which we find @xmath59    in order to complete the description of the cfl quark matter phase , we write the quark number density , @xmath60 which gives the baryon number density @xmath61    the condensation energy of the cooper pairs in the cfl phase given by eq .",
    "( [ gapcfl ] ) @xcite , requires the specification of the color superconducting gap . in order to make the present phenomenological approach compatible with microscopic treatments based on some results of qcd , here we use solutions provided by the nambu - jona - lassinio ( njl ) model with a local four - fermion interaction",
    "a recent study in this direction discussing the solution of the gap equation is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is given the following approximate gap expression : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the strength of the diquark pairing , with @xmath64 being the quark - antiquark coupling constant and @xmath65 a dimensionless parameter between @xmath66 , for the intermediate coupling strength , and @xmath67 corresponding to the strong coupling between quarks @xcite . in the above equation",
    "we have introduced a quark chemical potential shift , @xmath68 , where @xmath69 establishes the quark chemical potential value for which the gap begins to take significant values .    at this point",
    "one can realize that the present calculation involves two parameters from the dynamical quark mass expression ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) and the parameter @xmath25 to adjust the gap in the density region of interest .",
    "the values of the first pair of parameters are chosen according to the stability criterion applied to the strange quark matter energy per baryon , which reads @xmath70 at normal nuclear density @xmath71 , where @xmath72 @xmath24 is the energy per baryon in iron nuclei @xcite .",

    "@xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the current masses of up and down quarks are set @xmath75 .",
    "for the free parameter @xmath69 we have used the values @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 @xmath24 to adjust the gap behavior properly in the range of densities covered by compact objects in analysis .",
    "different combinations of the parameters values are considered in this work . in table",
    "[ t1 ] we display the different sets of the model parameter values applied in the present study .",
    "for the whole calculation we have fixed @xmath80 @xmath24 and @xmath81 .",
    "we will consider only the case @xmath82 for the diquark coupling strength .    in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ]",
    "we show the dependence of the constituent quark masses and the color superconducting gap as functions of the quark chemical potential , for the cases @xmath83 and @xmath84 displayed in table [ t1 ] , covering four values of the free gap parameter @xmath25 .",
    "we can see that for @xmath85 @xmath24 , the color superconducting phase dominates even for low values of the quark chemical potential .",
    "however , for higher values of the parameter @xmath25 , the unpaired phase dominates for low values of the quark chemical potential and thus we need to deal with a phase transition between the two phases . similar behavior for the gap and the constituent masses is observed for the other sets of parameters given in table [ t1 ] . consequently it is necessary to analyze phase transitions between the color superconducting and unpaired quark matter , as well as how sensitive is the phase transition to the parameter changes .",
    "we remark that the quark pairing lowers the constituent quark masses when compared to the values in the unpaired quark phase .",
    "for the unpaired quark matter ( uqm ) , the thermodynamic potential density reads @xmath86 with @xmath28 and where @xmath87 is the fermi momentum of each quark flavor , which is given by @xmath88    the number density of each quark flavor is defined by @xmath89 which provides explicitly @xmath90 for degenerate and massless free electrons , the free energy density is given by @xmath91 and thus the electron number density reads @xmath92    in beta equilibrium , the chemical potentials of quarks and electrons must satisfy the following relationships : @xmath93    the condition of electric charge neutrality provides the equation @xmath94    note that the existence of different quark masses turns impossible for the unpaired quark matter to satisfy equations ( [ chemicalpotential ] ) and ( [ charge ] ) simultaneously , without the presence of electrons in bulk .",
    "in order to analyze the occurrence of the phase transition , the behavior of the quark matter pressure as a function of the quark chemical potential is depicted in the fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for all sets of parameters combination given in table [ t1 ] . for the class a models , we can identify subtle intersections of the pressure curves for the cases a3 and a4 with the curve of the unpaired phase , which indicate the phase transitions between the two phases , occurring at @xmath95 @xmath24 ( case a3 ) and at @xmath96 @xmath24 ( case a4 ) .",
    "for the set of parameters d2 , d3 and d4 the phase transition between the two phases occurs at @xmath97 @xmath24 ( case d2 ) , @xmath98 @xmath24 ( case d3 ) , and at @xmath99 @xmath24 ( case d4 ) . for the last one ,",
    "the phase transition occurs at a baryon density @xmath100 , with @xmath101 @xmath102 being the normal nuclear matter density .",
    "we remark that small values of the parameter @xmath25 combined with the high values of the current strange quark mass provide stiffer equations of state , leading to more massive quark stars , as we will discuss latter .",
    "the calculation of the structure of the quark star models for given values of the central density is giving by solving numerically the tollman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations @xcite : @xmath103 and @xmath104    the obtained results show that larger values of @xmath105 and the current strange quark mass tend to give more massive and larger quark stars . with an appropriate choice of the gap parameter @xmath25 , it is possible to obtain masses and radii compatible with the neutron stars calculated with equation of states widely used to nuclear and hadronic matter .",
    "consequently , suitable selection of quark matter equation of state may lead to similar observational results obtained in different constitutive theoretical frameworks to the dense stellar matter composition .    in",
    "the panel showed in the fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we compare the limits of mass and radius given in the zel s works with those of quark stars calculated in this work , considering only the regime of strong coupling with @xmath106 .",

    "the corresponding quark star models can reach a mass of @xmath107 @xmath108 and radius @xmath109 @xmath110 , for @xmath111 @xmath24 , as showed in part - a of the panel , up to the maximum value @xmath112 @xmath108 with the radius @xmath113 @xmath110 , for @xmath114 @xmath24 , as showed in part - d of the panel .",

    "we can see that the obtained values of masses and radii for pure strange quark star models are in good agreement with those given by zel in the references @xcite and @xcite , and only in fair accordance with present data obtained for the compact star @xmath126 @xmath127 , which corresponds to the smallest radius of the set of compact stars showed in the figure . from the result obtained for this class of object",
    "we thus can infer that such type of small compact stars , with small radii , are not natural candidates for pure quark stars , as it happens for the other ones , more massive and with lager radii .",
    "nevertheless , small compact stars may be identified with hybrid stars composed of a quark matter core surrounded by a hadronic envelope .",
    "the present quark matter equation of state could still be helpful to describe the quark matter in the core of these hybrid structures .",
    "the strange quark matter in cfl phase is electrically neutral since the cooper quark pairing minimizes the energy if the quarks have equal fermi momenta . in this situation ,",
    "the number of @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 quarks are equal and the bulk electric charge is zero without the need of electrons in the medium .",
    "however , even for strange quark matter in the cfl phase , when surface effects are taken into account , the number of massive quarks is reduced near the boundary of the star relative to the number of massless quarks at fixed fermi momenta values .",
    "consequently , there is a net quark charge at the very thin surface of the system .",
    "the thickness of the charged surface layer of the cfl quark star is @xmath128 @xmath129 , as it was discussed in references @xcite .",
    "the presence of such strong electric fields near the surface of the cfl strange star , make possible the existence of nuclear crusts spatially separated from the deconfined cfl quark core @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to investigate the change in the quark star structure with the inclusion of a nuclear matter crust , we have constructed an equation of state for the crust assuming that cold stellar matter in this crust is composed of a nuclear lattice immersed in an electron gas . to describe this crust matter we have used the equation of state given in @xcite .",
    "hence , we can find equilibrium configurations compatible with the solution of the tov equations using this equations of state connected to the cfl matter equation of state previously constructed .    in fig .",

    "the thickness of these nuclear crusts are @xmath77 @xmath136 , for the first one , and @xmath142 @xmath138 , for the second one .",
    "the obtained results indicate that smaller values of @xmath25 correspond to more massive and less compact quark stars , almost entirely composed of quark matter .",
    "an interesting implication of the obtained results is that for increasing @xmath36 gap energies one obtains smaller nuclear crusts .",
    "however , the @xmath36  quark star will be naked only for a very unrealistic high value of the @xmath36 gap energy .",
    "observe that the maximum density at the base of the nuclear crust which envelopes the quark star is determined by the threshold density for neutron drip ( @xmath143 @xmath144 ) . on the other hand , the equal values of pressure at the surface of the quark matter core and the base of the nuclear crust",
    "is necessary to assure the hydrostatic equilibrium of the quark star as a whole .",

    ", we have investigated the quark star structure for suitable values of the model parameter @xmath21 , the current mass of the quark @xmath19 , and the @xmath36 gap energy , and so we have discussed the dependence of the observable properties of quark stars , such as maximum mass and radius , on the @xmath36 gap energy .    in the present phenomenological analysis",
    ", we have used a color superconducting gap parametrization derived from microscopic approaches widely applied to describe color superconducting quark matter .",
    "the density - dependent quark mass model is also used in order to mimic the quark chiral symmetry behavior .",
    "the results presented here show that massive compact stars with mass @xmath145 up to maximal masses @xmath112 @xmath108 would be interpreted as compact stars composed entirely of deconfined quarks , in the color superconducting phase or even in the unpaired phase .",
    "moreover , less massive and smaller compact stars would be identified with hybrid stars composed of a deconfined quark phase in the inner core enveloped by a hadronic phase , spatially separated due to the gravitational action .",
    "this configuration is allowed since the burning of nuclear matter into quarks must be an exothermic process .",
    "this specific situation can occurs for a range of densities , which are determined by the equations of state used to describe both phase , as shown in refs .",

    "<S> the calculations of quark star or hybrid star equilibrium structure must be compatible with the provided observational data . </S>",
    "<S> but , since the used equations of state describing quark matter are in general too soft , in comparison with the equation of states used to describe the hadronic or nuclear matter , the calculated quark star models presented in the literature are in general not suitable to explain the stability of high compact massive objects .    in this work , we present the calculations of spherically symmetric quark star structure by using an equation of state which takes into account the superconducting color - flavor locked ( cfl ) phase of the strange quark matter . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , some fundamental aspects of qcd ( asymptotic freedom and confinement ) are considered by means of a phenomenological description of the deconfined quark phase , the density - dependent quark mass model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the quark matter behavior introduced by these model stiffens the corresponding equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> we thus investigate the influence of these models on the mass - radius diagram of quark stars . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain massive quark stars due to the stiffness of the equation of state , when a reasonable parametrization of the color superconducting gap is used . </S>",
    "<S> models of quark stars enveloped by a nucleonic crust composed of a nuclear lattice embedded in an electron gas , with nuclei close to neutron drip line , are also discussed . </S>"
