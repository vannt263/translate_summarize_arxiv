    "gravitational microlensing is one of the methods that can be employed to search for planetary systems .",
    "current microlensing surveys focus primarily on searching for extrasolar planets by monitoring dense star fields in the direction of the galactic bulge .",
    "however , stellar binary systems are also detectable using this method and their identification is undoubtedly easier than for planetary binaries .",
    "@xcite .",
    "stellar binary systems detected via high magnification microlensing events have been studied by @xcite and @xcite , and these events are particularly useful for statistical studies of binary systems @xcite .",
    "this is because most high magnification candidates are detected before the peak ( or peaks ) of the light curve and the high magnification regions of the light curve are subsequently monitored by the follow - up networks .",
    "this usually leads to comprehensive coverage .",
    "therefore , the physical details of the lens system will be revealed by the modeling .",
    "gravitational microlensing depends on the mass of the lens and is not a function of lens brightness .",
    "therefore , microlensing can readily detect faint stellar remnants such as white dwarfs , neutron stars and black holes .",
    "due to their low luminosity , these objects are difficult to detect",
    ". isolated white dwarf stars are only really observable optically in the nearby galactic neighborhood , while neutron stars are detected in the radio frequency domain as pulsars .",
    "stellar mass black holes have been discovered as part of binary systems via x - ray and optical observations .",
    "the macho collaboration have interpreted several microlensing events in the direction of the galactic bulge as due to isolated black holes with stellar masses : macho-96-blg-5 , macho-98-blg-6 @xcite and macho-99-blg-22 @xcite , which is the same event as ogle-1999-bul-32 @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite .    in this paper , we report the high magnification microlensing event ogle-2007-blg-514 .",
    "we describe the observations and data sets in section [ sec : observation ] .",
    "the light curve modeling with various effects is presented in section [ sec : modeling ] .",
    "we discuss the measurement of the source magnitude and color , and derive the angular einstein radius in section [ sec : correction ] . in section [ sec : blending ] , the blending brightness for this event is discussed .",

    "ogle-2007-blg-514 was announced as a likely microlensing event by the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) early warning system ( ews ; @xcite ) on 1 september 2007 ( @xmath12 ) and independently by the microlensing observations in astrophysics ( moa ) collaboration @xcite as moa-2007-blg-464 on 26 september 2007 .",
    "the equatorial coordinates for this event are @xmath13 , which yields the galactic coordinates @xmath14 .",
    "forty days later ( 11 october ) , the ogle collaboration issued a high - magnification alert .",
    "two days after the high - magnification alert , the light curve reached its first peak allowing follow - up observations to be conducted by ten telescopes all around the world .",
    "the double peak light curve for this event is shown in figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] .",
    "the first peak was covered by ogle and ctio ( hjd@xmath15 4386.5 ) , the second peak was covered by bronberg and irsf ( hjd@xmath15 4387.2 ) .",
    "the valley between the peaks was covered by two telescopes , canopus and faulkes telescope north . the caustic curve and source trajectory in the best - fit model",
    "is shown in figure [ fig : caustic ] .",
    "the event was also observedusing high - resolution spectroscopy in order to identify the source star properties @xcite .",
    "we utilize this information to estimate the limb darkening coefficients ( section  [ sec : ld ] ) .",
    "the data set for ogle-2007-blg-514 consists of observations from 12 different observatories representing the ogle , moa , the microlensing follow up network ( @xmath16fun ; @xcite ) , robonet @xcite , the probing lensing anomalies network ( planet ; @xcite ) , as well as the infrared survey facility ( irsf ) .",
    "specifically , the data set includes data from the following telescopes , locations and passbands : ogle - iii 1.3 m warsaw telescope at las campanas observatory ( chile ) @xmath17-band , moa - ii 1.8 m telescope at mt john university observatory ( new zealand ) wide-@xmath18-band , moa 0.61 m b@xmath19c telescope at mt john university observatory ( new zealand ) @xmath17 and @xmath20 bands , @xmath16fun 0.4 m telescope at auckland observatory ( new zealand ) @xmath18-band , @xmath16fun 0.35 m telescope at bronberg observatory ( south africa ) unfiltered , @xmath16fun 1.3 m smarts telescope at ctio ( chile ) @xmath20 , @xmath17 , and @xmath21 bands , @xmath16fun 0.5 m telescope at campo catino austral observatory ( cao , chile ) unfiltered , @xmath16fun 0.35 m telescope at farm cove observatory ( new zealand ) unfiltered , robonet 2.0 m faulkes telescope north ( ftn ) at haleakala observatory ( hawaii ) @xmath18 band , robonet 2.0 m faulkes telescope south ( fts ) at siding spring observatory ( australia ) @xmath18 band , planet 1.0 m telescope at canopus observatory ( australia ) @xmath17 band , and irsf 1.4 m telescope at saao ( south africa ) @xmath22 , @xmath21 and @xmath23 bands .",
    "the various data sets were reduced using several methods .",
    "the ogle data were reduced using the standard ogle dia pipeline @xcite .",
    "the moa , @xmath16fun and irsf data were reduced using the moa dia pipeline @xcite .",
    "@xmath16fun ctio @xmath24 band data were also reduced using dophot @xcite which we used for the source brightness and color in section [ sec : correction ] .",
    "the robonet data were reduced by the dandia pipeline @xcite , and the planet data using pysis version 3.0 reduction pipeline @xcite .",
    "the bronberg unfiltered data were not included in the modeling because it may require airmass corrections .",
    "fortunately , irsf @xmath25-band data covered the same region as the bronberg data .",
    "we have checked that the result was not affected by whether the bronberg data were included or not .",
    "the moa b&c data were also not included in the modeling because all of the three day s worth of data points are poor quality due to the weather conditions .",
    "moreover , the same region was covered by the moa - ii data .",
    "both telescopes are located at mt john , and the moa - ii telescope yields better quality data .",
    "the error bars for the data points have been re - normalized such that the reduced @xmath26 of the best fit model @xmath27 .",
    "we used the formula , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the original error value of the @xmath30th data point in magnitude units , and the re - normalizing parameters are @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "this non - linear formula operates so that the error bars at high magnification are affected by the parameter @xmath32 , which can be described flat - fielding errors . for the parameter of @xmath32",
    ", we plot the cumulative distribution of @xmath26 where the data points were sorted by error in magnitude , and we choose values of @xmath32 such that the cumulative distribution is a straight line with slope of 1 .",
    "then , the parameter of @xmath31 is chosen to be @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath31 and @xmath32 are determined separately for each data set and are shown in table [ tb : norm ] .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig : lightcurve ] that ogle-2007-blg-514 is not a single - lens event due to the double peak structure in the light curve . from the light curve shape alone",
    "we can deduce that either the source passed in close proximity to two caustic cusps or it passed across the caustic itself .",
    "moreover , the extremely high magnification ( @xmath0 ) of the event indicates that the source star passed near the central caustic .",
    "since the ogle and ctio telescopes covered the first peak of the light curve , finite source effects must be included in the modeling .",
    "thus , our strategy began by searching for best fit parameters using a binary lens model and finite source parameters .",
    "we subsequently introduced parameters to incorporate higher order effects .      to properly model finite source effects",
    "we need to allow for limb darkening , which accounts for the changing brightness between the source disk center and the rim .",
    "we adopted a linear limb darkening law with one parameter for the source brightness @xmath33 .",
    "\\label{eq : ld}\\ ] ] here , @xmath34 is the limb darkening coefficients , @xmath35 is the central surface brightness of the source , and @xmath36 is the angle between the normal to the stellar surface and the line of sight , i.e. , @xmath37=@xmath38/@xmath39 , where @xmath38 is the angular distance from the center of the source as measured in the plane of the sky .    from @xcite , the source star ( ogle-2007-blg-514s ) is a g dwarf in the galactic bulge , @xmath40 = 5644 @xmath41 130 k , @xmath42 = 4.10 @xmath41 0.28 cm s@xmath43 , and high - metallicity log[fe / h ] = 0.27 @xmath41 0.09 dex .",
    "therefore , we fix the limb darkening coefficients selected from @xcite with effective temperature @xmath40 = 5500 k , surface gravity @xmath42 = 4.0 cm s@xmath43 and metallicity @xmath44[m / h ] = 0.3 ( table  [ tb : ldparameter ] ) .      the best fit binary lens model parameters were searched for using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) approach that frequently changes the  jump function \" in order to efficiently locate the minimum @xmath26 value . for example , refer to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a single lens microlensing model has three parameters : the time of peak magnification , @xmath45 , the einstein radius crossing time , @xmath46 , and the minimum impact parameter , @xmath47 .",
    "a binary lens model requires three additional parameters : the mass ratio , @xmath48 , which is the mass of the companion relative to the mass of the primary lens ; the binary lens separation , @xmath49 , which is the separation of the binary components projected on to the lens plane and normalized to the einstein radius ; and the angle of the source trajectory relative to the binary lens axis , @xmath50 .",
    "an additional required parameter , @xmath51 , is the source radius relative to the angular einstein radius which in combination with the limb darkening law is used to model the finite source effects .",
    "furthermore , there are two parameters for each data set and passband that are required to describe the individual unmagnified source and background fluxes .",
    "we conducted a broad parameter search with initial parameters distributed over the ranges @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the best models from this search involved a binary lens with a mass ratio of @xmath54 and the trajectory of the source star making a close approach to the central caustic ( figure [ fig : caustic ] ) .",
    "given that the primary lens has a stellar mass , the lens companion is also a star with a stellar mass and not a planet .",
    "two models with approximately equal @xmath26 values yielded lens component separations of @xmath55 and @xmath56 in units of the einstein radius .",
    "this degeneracy in the component separation @xmath57 for a central caustic event was predicted by @xcite .",
    "the central caustic has a diamond - like shape .",
    "so , we expect that the source trajectory angle @xmath50 will have four possible solutions involving approaches to two caustic cusps .",
    "the general parameter search yielded two preferred solutions with @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which correspond to the binary degeneracy @xcite .",
    "the other two expected angles @xmath60 and @xmath61 do not generate good models compared with the @xmath58 and @xmath59 models .",
    "this is because the magnification contours near the caustic are not perfectly symmetric . as a result , we get four binary lens models with close / wide separation degeneracies and impact parameter @xmath47 degeneracies .",
    "the best fit parameters are listed in table [ tb : parallax ] , and are denoted as close1 and wide1 .      from the binary modeling ( section [ sec : binary ] ) , the einstein radius crossing time , @xmath46 , is very long , @xmath62 days , implying that there is a good chance to detect earth s orbital parallax effects in the light curve",
    ". microlens parallax falls into two different categories , the earth s orbital motion around the sun and the difference of telescope location on the earth .",
    "these parallaxes are called  orbital parallax \" and  terrestrial parallax \" , respectively .",
    "we searched for a parallax model including these effects both separately ( models  2 \" and  3 \" in the table [ tb : parallax ] ) and combined ( models  4 \" in the table [ tb : parallax ] ) . from now on models with ",
    "parallax \" will mean with both effects taken into account .",
    "two additional parameters , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , express the parallax effect on the light curve @xcite .",
    "these are the two components of the microlens parallax amplitude , @xmath65 .",
    "the parallax amplitude @xmath66 is also represented by the lens - source relative parallax , @xmath67 , and the angular einstein radius @xmath68 , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the einstein radius projected onto the observer plane . from the parallax amplitude parameter ,",
    "the degeneracy of three physical parameters : lens mass , distance and transverse velocity in @xmath46 , is broken , allowing us to determine the properties of the lens .    in our parallax model search",
    ", we explored four classes of models with close and wide separations and also in case of impact parameter @xmath71 and @xmath72 based on the results of the binary lens model search .",
    "the parameters for the parallax model are listed in table [ tb : parallax ] .",
    "we found that the @xmath26 of the best fit parallax model was improved by 19 over the non - parallax model , and these models are denoted as  4 \" in the table .",
    "most of the improvement of @xmath26 is from the moa and ogle data .",
    "this is reasonable because the moa and ogle data cover a large portion of the light curve rendering orbital parallax effects significant for the light curve .",
    "the @xmath71 model is a better fit than the @xmath72 model , but since the improvement is only @xmath73 , the @xmath47 sign degeneracy is not decisively resolved .      aside from the microlens",
    "parallax effects , it is possible that the lens orbital motion effect also have influenced the light curve .",
    "the orbital motion of the lens has strong effects when the source passes through or approaches the caustics . for the orbital motion of the lens , we require two additional orbital motion parameters , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , @xcite .",
    "these parameters indicate the binary rotation rate , and the uniform expansion rate in binary separation , @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , the new ones of @xmath76 and @xmath77 are described as @xmath78    the results of the lens orbital motion modeling are shown in table [ tb : om ] .",
    "the close separation model is better fit than the wide separation model .",
    "but , the @xmath47 sign degeneracy is not decisively resolved .",
    "then , we also performed fits including both parallax and lens orbital motion effects .",
    "the results are shown in table [ tb : om ] .",
    "the best fit model with the parallax and lens orbital motion indicates that the companion of the lens have the orbital motion parameters of @xmath79 rad days@xmath80 and @xmath81 days@xmath80 .",
    "it is already known that @xmath74 is often degenerate with @xmath82 , which is the component of @xmath83 perpendicular to the apparent acceleration of the sun projected on the sky @xcite . for this event",
    ", we could break this degeneracy .",
    "for composition of the lens system , the projected velocity of the lens companion should be smaller than the escape velocity of the lens system : @xmath84 @xcite , where , @xmath85 and where @xmath86 .",
    "we confirmed that the results for each model was not over the escape velocity of the lens system , using the lens mass and distance calculated by the combined parallax and lens orbital motion model ( section [ sec : properties ] ) .",
    "the orbital parallax effect is caused by the earth s orbit around the sun .",
    "on the other hand , if a companion star is orbiting about the source star , the light curve is affected in the same way with microlens parallax .",
    "this effect is called  xallarap \" .",
    "it has been discussed that the earth s orbital parallax effect can be degenerate with the xallarap effect @xcite .",
    "the xallarap model has five additional parameters : the two components of xallarap amplitude , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , which represent the xallarap amplitude , @xmath89 , the direction of observer relative to the source orbital axis , r.a.@xmath90 and decl.@xmath90 , and the orbital period , @xmath91 .",
    "for an elliptical orbit , two additional parameters are required : the orbital eccentricity , @xmath92 and time of periastron , @xmath93 . in our xallarap model fit , the two parameters for an elliptical orbit are fixed as the parameters for the earth s orbit . note that we assumed that the brightness from the companion of the source is low , so we did not include the additional parameter for the source companion brightness .",
    "we also impose on our xallarap the kepler constraint .",
    "the @xmath94 is represented by the following equation , estimated from kepler s third law : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the einstein radius projected onto the source plane ( @xmath97 ) , @xmath98 is the separation of the source companion , @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the mass of the primary and companion source , respectively . to find the best xallarap model that is allowed by kepler s third law , we have done mcmc runs with an additional constraint to @xmath26 @xcite given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 is evaluated by equation [ eq : xallarap_amp ] with parameters in each step of the mcmc and fixed values of @xmath103 and 50% error in @xmath102 , which depend only weakly on other parameters . here , @xmath104 is the heaviside step function .",
    "first , we prepared the initial parameters of the orbital period as fixed parameters in the fits in interval of 20 days from 10 to 400 days , and the others as free parameters .",
    "the @xmath26 distribution for the orbital period is shown in figure [ fig : xallarap ] .",
    "we found that a short orbital period produces a good model , so we restarted the fit around @xmath105 days without any fixed parameters .",
    "note that the result is not changed even if the model includes the kepler constraint , due to the small xallarap amplitude ( which is shown by the dashed line in figure [ fig : xallarap ] ) .",
    "the best fit xallarap model has @xmath106 , which is significantly better than the only parallax effect model , giving @xmath107 .",
    "the best fit parameters are shown in table [ tb : xallarap ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath91 is not consistent with the earth s orbital period , so this xallarap model is different than the parallax model .",
    "the best fit xallarap @xmath26 value is smaller than the parallax model and the combined parallax and lens orbital motion model .",
    "moreover , the xallarap model is different than the parallax model .",
    "this implies that the xallarap effect is considered more significant than the parallax effect on the light curve",
    ". however , spurious xallarap signals at this level are common in microlensing @xcite . and",
    ", the data on this event has high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) , so we expect that stronger false signals are caused by systematics .",
    "therefore , the parallax and lens orbital motion model is the most plausible solution , but we can not absolutely excluded the xallarap model .",
    "thus , we consider two solutions of the parallax model and the xallarap model for the estimation of the lens properties . for the estimation of the angular einstein radius , @xmath68 , in section [ sec : correction ] , we used the best fit parameters of the model with both parallax and lens orbital motion effects ( close separation and the @xmath72 model ) .",
    "the best fit model has a binary mass ratio of @xmath1 and a separation of @xmath2 in a unit of einstein radius with @xmath108 .",
    "in contrast , the probability distribution of the lens properties was also estimated by using the xallarap model parameters in section [ sec : properties ] .",
    "we performed fits including both parallax and xallarap effects because parallax amplitude is related to the lens mass .",
    "the results are listed in table [ tb : xallarap ] .",
    "the xallarap and parallax model has a binary mass ratio of @xmath7 and a separation of @xmath8 in a unit of einstein radius with @xmath109 , and @xmath110 days .",
    "since the orbital period of the source companion is very short , it may be that parallax and xallarap do not affect the same part of the light curve .",
    "it is possible that the parallax results are unaffected by xallarap effects .",
    "therefore , the parallax signal has not been detected on the light curve significantly , so we set the upper limit of the parallax amplitude @xmath111 from the @xmath112 contour map of parallax parameters in figure [ fig : parallax ] .",
    "this upper limit will imply a lower limit of the lens mass .",
    "the source star angular radius @xmath39 was determined using source magnitude and color .",
    "the source star magnitudes and colors estimated from the light curve fit need to be corrected for extinction and reddening due to the interstellar dust in the line of sight .",
    "the red clump giant ( rcg ) is the standard candle to estimate extinction and reddening .",
    "the color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) was made from ctio @xmath17- and @xmath20- band stars within 2@xmath113 of the source star calibrated to the ogle - iii calalog ( figure  [ fig : cmd ] ) . in this cmd",

    "hence , the distance modulus of the clump is dm=@xmath118 .",
    "thus , the dereddened rcg centroid is expected to be @xmath119 comparing these centroids , we find the extinction value @xmath120 and reddening value @xmath121 to be , ( @xmath122 ) = ( 2.24 , 2.07 ) @xmath41 ( 0.11 , 0.06 ) .",

    "the relationship between color / brightness and a star angular radius is @xmath130 so the source angular radius is @xmath131 thus , the angular einstein radius @xmath68 is calculated by the source angular radius @xmath39 and @xmath132 to be @xmath133 and finally the lens - source relative proper motion @xmath134 is @xmath135",
    "blending magnitudes obtained from the fits are listed in table  [ tb : flux ] .",

    "note that this upper limit is quite conservative because there is a possibility that some of the dust is behind the lens .",
    "the upper limit of the brightness implies that the upper limit of the lens mass is @xmath160 , assuming the primary lens is a main sequence star .",

    "the distribution described in blue indicates the results for all mass functions , and the curves in black and red represent the results for only from mss and wds , respectively . in the bottom - right panel ,",
    "the probability distribution for the brightness is derived using only main sequence stars and excludes remnant stars as these should be very faint .",
    "the solid and dashed curve indicate the probability of the brightness with and without the upper limit of the brightness @xmath184 , respectively , and the vertical dashed line represents the upper limit of the brightness .",
    "the probability ratio for each class of mss , wds , nss , and bhs is 0.35 , 0.23 , 0.09 , and 0.33 , respectively , which indicates that the primary lens is likely a stellar remnant 65% of the time , such as a white dwarf , a neutron star or a black hole .    as a result ,",
    "the lens properties were derived from the probability distribution as follows : the primary star is a massive star with a mass of @xmath9 , distance of @xmath10 kpc , and the companion has a mass of @xmath11 .",
    "the einstein radius is @xmath185 au , which means that the projected separation is @xmath186 au and the physical three - dimensional separation is @xmath187 au on the close and wide separation model , respectively .",
    "the physical three - dimensional separation was estimated by putting a planetary orbit at random inclination , eccentricity and phase @xcite .",
    "recently , the mass functions of stellar remnants have been updated by improvements of observational methods and detections of stellar remnants ( white dwarfs : @xcite , neutron stars : @xcite , and black holes : @xcite ) .",
    "however , the qualitative conclusions are not affected by these uncertain mass functions .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the primary lens is most likely to be a stellar remnant such as a white dwarf , a neutron star or a black hole .",
    "we have reported the binary microlensing event ogle-2007-blg-514 .",
    "this is an extremely high - magnification event ( @xmath0 ) , which enabled follow - up observations of this event . from the binary lens model search",
    ", we found that the lens has a stellar binary mass ratio @xmath188 .",
    "the well - known degeneracies of the close / wide separation and impact parameter @xmath71 and @xmath72 both remained unresolved in our light - curve analysis .",
    "we also search for the higher order effects of microlens parallax , lens orbital motion , and xallarap ( source orbital motion ) for this event .",
    "the xallarap model @xmath26 is better than the parallax and lens orbital motion model , respectively .",
    "however , spurious xallarap signals at this level are common in microlensing @xcite . and",
    ", the data on this event has high s / n , so we expect that stronger false signals can be caused by systematics . therefore , the combined parallax and lens orbital motion model is the most plausible solution , but we can not absolutely exclude the xallarap model .",
    "thus , we consider two solutions of the parallax model and xallarap model for the estimation of the lens properties .",
    "the best fit model with parallax and lens orbital motion has a binary mass ratio of @xmath1 and a separation of @xmath2 in a unit of einstein radius with @xmath108 . on the other hand",
    ", the xallarap and parallax model has a binary mass ratio of @xmath7 and a separation of @xmath8 einstein radius .",
    "the parallax model parameters allow us to determine the lens properties . according to the model with parallax and lens orbital motion effects , the lens total",
    "mass is @xmath150 , as the components of the lens , the primary lens has @xmath189 with a companion @xmath190 .",
    "the distance to the lens is @xmath152 .",
    "the upper limit of the brightness implies that the upper limit of the lens mass is @xmath160 , assuming the primary lens is a main sequence star .",
    "the main sequence star is the dominant component in the galaxy , and the upper limit of the lens mass , assuming that the primary lens is a main sequence star , is consistent within the error bars of the primary lens mass calculated by the parallax model parameters .",
    "thus , the parallax model indicates that the binary lens system is likely constructed by the main sequence stars .    on the other hand ,",
    "the probability distribution of the lens properties was estimated by the bayesian analysis using the xallarap and parallax model .",
    "the parallax amplitude , @xmath111 , is adopted for the upper limit of the lens mass .",
    "also , the upper limit of the brightness in @xmath17 band was included in the analysis . as a results ,",
    "the primary star is a massive star with a mass of @xmath9 , a distance of @xmath10 kpc , and a companion mass of @xmath11 .",
    "the probability ratio for each class of mss , wds , nss , and bhs is 0.35 , 0.23 , 0.09 , 0.33 , respectively , which indicates that the primary lens is likely a stellar remnant 65% of the time , such as a white dwarf , a neutron star or a black hole .",
    "moreover , based on the ogle astrometry , we found that the blended light is associated with the event to high precision ( the difference of the position of the source and lens is estimated to be 23 mas , i.e. , within the astrometric error . ) .",
    "therefore , we considered three possibilities of where the blended light was coming from .",
    "the first is the primary lens .",
    "this suggestion is consistent with the parallax model that the primary lens is likely a main sequence star , which has a solar mass .",
    "the second is the companion of the lens .",
    "this is possible to explain by the results of the xallarap model .",
    "for example , if the primary lens is a black hole , the companion of the lens have a mass close to a solar mass .",
    "the last is the companion of the source in the xallarap model .",
    "but , it is difficult to interpret that the blended light is only coming from the companion of the source because the companion of the source is far from the earth and very low mass , so the companion is very faint .    as a final conclusion",
    ", we found two solutions for this event .",
    "the one is the parallax model , which indicates that the binary lens system is likely constructed by the main sequence stars .",
    "the another is the xallarap model , which indicates that the primary lens is likely the stellar remnant , such as a white dwarf , a neutron star or a black hole .    in the future , follow - up observations by radio , optical , or x - ray space telescopes",
    "will identify whether the primary lens is a main sequence star or a stellar remnant .",
    "high spatial resolution observations with large ground - based telescope and adaptive - optics instruments , such as the subaru telescope or the very large telescope ( vlt ) , could estimate more precise brightness from the lens using the source brightness obtained from the modeling .",
    "in addition , it has been 4 years since the peak magnification of this event , and the lens - source relative proper motion is @xmath191 mas year@xmath80 , indicating that the separation of the source and lens on the sky plane is about 10 mas by now .",
    "high resolution observation with the space telescope , hubble space telescope ( hst ) , could detect an elongated psf blended with the lens and source , and verify the nature of the lens .",
    "microlensing searches are going on throughout the world .",
    "in particular , the ogle group began using a new wide field of view camera , the ogle - iv ( 1.4 deg@xmath192 fov ) , in march 2010 and the number of microlensing events dramatically increased after the ogle - iv upgrade .",
    "of course , the moa group is continuing to operate its microlensing search with the moa - ii telescope with its wide field of view ( 2.2 deg@xmath192 ) moa - cam3 ccd camera @xcite . in 2011",
    ", two survey groups found about 1800 microlensing events , which constitutes a two fold increase over last year .",
    "more and more binary lens objects varying from planetary systems to massive binary systems can be discovered by further microlensing observation .",
