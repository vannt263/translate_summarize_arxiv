    "their ir luminosity is thought to be generated by star formation ( sf ) , active galactic nucleus ( agn ) activity , or both . although ulirgs / hylirgs are very rare populations in the local universe , their relative abundance in galaxies is much higher at higher redshift .",

    "therefore , it is important to search for ir luminous galaxies such as ulirgs and hylirgs for understanding the galaxy formation and evolution and connection to their supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) .",
    "one of the simple ways to select those ir luminous objects at @xmath11 2 is to use the optical and ir color , @xmath12 - [ 24 ] @xmath1 7.5 where @xmath12 and [ 24 ] are @xmath12-band ( 0.65 @xmath5 ) and _ spitzer_/mips @xcite 24 @xmath5 ab magnitude , respectively .",

    "in this study , we derived @xmath36 based on the sed fitting given the sed template of stellar and agn component , without considering the sf component .",
    "however , one caution is that the current data do not always constrain the peak of the sed . in the case of high - z objects , in particular",
    ", the peak wavelength of the sed contributed from agns is beyond the longest detection at 22 @xmath5 ( see , for example , the lower - right panel in figure [ seabas ] ) , which induces the large uncertainties of @xmath36 .",
    "if the sf component affects their 12 and 22 @xmath5 flux , the derived @xmath36 has a potential not only of underestimate as described in section [ sed_fitting ] , but also of overestimate due to the lack of the data covering the peak of the sed of the agn component .",
    "we discuss here how the agn template will be affected and how the overall sed and derived @xmath36 will change correspondingly , when executing the sed fitting with or without sf component for our data .",
    "we evaluate this effect based on the 113 dogs presented by @xcite who also derived the @xmath36 for dogs by performing the sed fitting .",

    "next , we calculate the @xmath32 based on seabass without sf template ( i.e. , stellar + agn templates ) for the same data and compare them with those in @xcite , as shown in figure [ lir_comp_agn ] .",
    "this result indicates that the lack of sf component basically induces the underestimate of @xmath32 when performing the sed fitting , whereas the absence of the sf component has a potential of overestimate for dogs with a very large @xmath32 .",

    ", one should keep in mind this uncertainty when discussing the @xmath32 .",
    "derived by seabass without sf component and @xcite .",
    "the red dotted line is the one - to - one line.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]        as discussed above , in the case of having the deep _ herschel _ data , the derived @xmath32 is reliable with small uncertainties .",
    "however , in this study , we performed the sed fitting for including _ akari _ data which give the upper limit of fir flux .",
    "if we do not have deep _ herschel _ data but have only much shallower _",
    "akari_/fis data as this work , can akari data do a similar job to have good constraints to the ir luminosity ? to address this issue , we estimate the @xmath32 for kpno + _ spitzer _ + _ akari_/fir data for dog 1 and dog 2 , and compare with those derived from kpno + _ spitzer _ + _ herschel_. the resultant @xmath32 are @xmath56 and @xmath57 which is 0.31 and 6.70 times larger than those derived with _ herschel _ data , respectively .",
    "therefore , the upper limit of _",
    "photometry could not work very well for high @xmath32 objects because they are usually those with a fitted agn peak at much longer wavelengths than 22 @xmath21 m .",
    "in addition to the absence of sf component , one should keep in mind that the absence of deep fir data also influences on the derived @xmath32 .      the relation between @xmath4 - [ 22 ] and @xmath32 as shown in figure [ i_22_lir ] gives us a clue of effective search for hylirgs .",
    "this figure indicates that objects with redder @xmath4 - [ 22 ] color tend to have higher infrared luminosity , although there is large scatter . in order to investigate how reliable this correlation quantitatively",

    "the resultant spearman s rank coefficient for this correlation is 0.51 , corresponding to a null hypothesis probability of 9.9 @xmath30 10@xmath58 .",
    "this means that @xmath4 - [ 22 ] and @xmath36 for ir - bright dogs have a positive correlation with a high significance .",
    "this correlation can be interpreted qualitatively as follows : the ir luminosity is generated by combination of sf , agn , or both , and the contribution of agns to the ir luminosity increases with increasing ir luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". on the other hand , @xmath4 - [ 22 ] value mostly corresponds to the extinction , that correlates with sfr at larger stellar mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , the absolute contribution both of agn and sf can be increased and hylirgs could correspond maximum phase in terms of agn and sf activity ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "the number of the sdss  wise photo dogs with @xmath4 - [ 22 ] @xmath1 7.5 is 1,327 , thus this sample probably contains @xmath8 930 hylirgs .",
    "note that the above correlation is seen in dogs with 22 @xmath5 flux grater than 3.8 mjy , and thus our result may not be applicable for ir - faint dogs .",
    "therefore further studies on the relation between the @xmath4 - [ 22 ] color and the hylirg fraction are needed to generalize this method for hylirg searches , that is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "note also that ir luminosities of those elirgs are potentially amplified by effect of beaming and/or gravitational lensing even if the derived @xmath36 is reliable .",
    "it is quite difficult to reject these possibilities quantitatively based on the currently available data .",
    "so , we just mention here that some observational supports for possible hylirgs . for the potential of the beaming effect",
    ", we checked their variability flag at 22 @xmath5 in allwise catalog because beaming effect could induce the rapid variability as discussed in @xcite . as a result ,",
    "10 objects including possible two elirgs have _ var_flg _ = 0 , which means that they are expected to show no variability while 4 objects have 1 @xmath59 _ var_flg _ @xmath59 2 , meaning that they could show very weak variability .",
    "the remaining 10 objects have _ var_flg _ = `` n '' that indicates insufficient or inadequate data to make a determination of possible variability . note that although the estimate of the flux variability is unreliable for extended source with _ ext_flg _",

    "@xmath60 0 in the pipeline of allwise , our sample have _ ext_flag _",
    "= 0 and _ cc_flag _ = 0 , hence the estimate of the flux variability should be reliable .",
    "for the potential of lensing effect , @xmath4 - [ 22 ] color dependence of ir luminosity indicates the extreme ir luminosities of those hylirgs are unlikely due to the lensing .",
    "if their ir luminosities are just amplified by lensing , their @xmath4 - [ 22 ] color are expected to be comparable to those of ulirgs , but indeed their @xmath4 - [ 22 ] color get redder .",
    "therefore , the influence of the beaming and lensing on @xmath36 for most hylirgs discovered in this work could be expected to be small .",
    "recently , some authors have reported that a method based on the _ wise _ color is also useful to discover hylirgs and elirgs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "these objects are termed `` w1w2dropouts '' or `` hot dogs '' @xcite . since our sample of hylirgs / elirgs",
    "are selected based on _ wise _ data , we checked whether our sample satisfy the criteria for w1w2dropouts .",

    "the fact that almost all of our sample do not satisfy the criteria of w1w2dropouts is reasonable because w1w2dropouts are expected to be very faint in the optical due to their steep continuum , and thus relatively shallow imaging in the sdss spectroscopic catalog could miss large amount of w1w2dropouts .",
    "in other words , most hylirgs selected based on @xmath4 - [ 22 ] color do not duplicate of those in w1w2dropout method , suggesting that our selection method could be independently useful for selecting hylirgs .",
    "we emphasize that those selection methods are complemental .",
    "the w1w2dropout method could be sensitive to heavily absorbed hylirgs while our method is sensitive to less or moderately aborted ( compared with w1w2dropouts ) hylirgs . in that sense , our method is complemental compared with the w1w2dropout method .",
    "we here estimate the surface number density of hyper - luminous dogs ( ir - bright dogs that satisfy hylirgs criterion in a strict sense ) and compared it with that of other sample presented by @xcite who selected hylirgs based on a _ wise _ color similar to w1w2dropouts with optical magnitude cut ( @xmath61 22 ) .",
    "they reported that these objects have a surface density of @xmath8 0.1 deg@xmath6 .",
    "it should be noted that since dogs are generally faint in the optical , our hylirgs search with sdss could induce a significant sample incompleteness .",
    "in addition , the selection function of the sdss spectroscopic survey is complicated . in this paper",
    ", we hence simply estimate the lower limit of surface number density by assuming that ( i ) the 22 @xmath21 m flux of the hyper - luminous dogs almost reaches the 100 % completeness ( i.e , completeness correction in terms of the _ wise _ survey can be neglected ) and ( ii ) the wise  sdss photo dogs are approximately completely selected by at least the depth of the sdss spectroscopic survey which is shallower than the photometric survey .    under these assumptions ,",
    "the surface number density of hyper - luminous dogs ( @xmath62 ) can be derived as the sum of the expected number of possible hylirgs in the wise  sdss photo dogs sample and hylirgs discovered in this study , per each apparent @xmath4-band magnitude bin ; @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the number of apparent @xmath4-band magnitude bin , @xmath65 is the survey area ( 14,555 deg@xmath6 ) in this study and @xmath66 is the scaling factor that is the ratio of the number of the hyper - luminous dogs and the wise  sdss spec dog each @xmath67 bin . @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the number of the wise  sdss photo dogs without spectroscopic information and hyper - luminous dogs discovered in this study , in each @xmath67 bin , respectively . as a result , we obtained the @xmath62 @xmath1 0.17 deg@xmath7 , which is roughly consistent with those derived by @xcite .",
    "in this work , we performed to search for hylirgs with @xmath70 10@xmath2 @xmath3 that are most likely to be traced the maximum phase in terms of the sf and agn activity and thus important population for understanding the co - evolution of smbh - galaxy .",
    "we utilized the latest _ wise _ and sdss catalogs and selected 67 candidates of hyper - luminous dogs with 22 @xmath5 flux @xmath1 3.8 mjy based on the criterion of the dogs selection ( @xmath4 - [ 22 ] @xmath1 7.0 ) .",
    "we then executed the sed fitting for the data obtained from _",
    "akari _ , _ wise _ , and sdss to estimate their @xmath36 .",
    "the main results are as follows :    1 .",
    "we succeed in discovering the 24 hylirgs including two possible elirgs with @xmath70 10@xmath10 @xmath3 .",
    "their @xmath4 - [ 22 ] color correlates with @xmath36 ; the detection rate of hylirgs is about 73 % when extracting the ir - bright dogs with @xmath4 - [ 22 ] @xmath1 7.5 , which is an useful method to search for these ir luminous galaxies .",
    "3 .   among 24 hylirgs ,",
    "only one object satisfy the criteria of w12dropouts whose @xmath36 are equivalent to those of hylirgs selected based only from wise data , which means that the suggested method in this study could be independently - effective against w12dropout method .",
    "the surface number density of 24 hyper - luminous dogs is @xmath8 0.17 deg@xmath6 that is rough consistent with that of previous works .",
    "this study is based on the wise and sdss spectroscopic data that photometric sensitivities are shallower than those of the sdss photometric data , which means that our sample are biased to optically - bright sources .",
    "we are proposing to follow - up observations for wise  sdss photo dogs to extend our hylirgs survey to more optically - faint hylirgs .",
    "we will check whether or not the correlation between @xmath4 - [ 22 ] and @xmath36 can be seen for optically - faint hylirgs . in that sense , this work is an important benchmark for forthcoming hylirgs survey .",
    "we are planning to summarize their spectroscopic properties and to report the relation among these quantities such as equivalent width of emission lines and infrared luminosities .",
    "all the informations of 67 wise  sdss spec dogs including such as the specobjid , coordinates , and infrared luminosity will be presented in the forthcoming paper .",
