    "an ordered state known as the @xmath1-density wave ( ddw ) has been proposed as the origin of the pseudogap phase of the cuprates.@xcite a variety of experiments have been explored from this perspective .",
    "these include the superfluid density and the resonance peak in neutron scattering,@xcite the hall number,@xcite angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes),@xcite the specific heat,@xcite the quasiparticle charge,@xcite and the direct signature of ddw in polarized neutron scattering.@xcite in addition , it has been explored how the notion of this competing order , when combined with interlayer tunneling , and the doping imbalance of the multilayered cuprates , can result in the striking systematics of the layer dependence of the superconducting transition temperature @xmath4.@xcite in all cases , the theory is consistent with the existing observations .    in this paper",
    ", we will address the zero - temperature infrared ( ir ) hall angle @xmath5 as a function of the hole - doping @xmath3 , because we are encouraged by the recent measurements of rigal _",
    "et al._@xcite there are two specific reasons : ( 1 ) the ddw state predicts hole pockets as fermi surfaces in the underdoped cuprates , which should have important experimental consequences .",
    "arpes experiments can only detect half of each of these pockets,@xcite which therefore appear as fermi arcs.@xcite thus an important prediction of our theory remains untested , except through its indirect signature in the doping dependence of the superfluid density .",
    "a measurement of @xmath5 can , in principle , clarify this issue , and we believe that it has.@xcite ( 2 ) the ddw theory also predicts a quantum critical point at a doping @xmath6 within the superconducting dome and it has been argued that this should be visible in the hall number , @xmath7,@xcite if superconductivity is destroyed by applying a magnetic field .",
    "there is some experimental evidence of this effect.@xcite the difficulty with this experiment is that it needs to performed in a field as high as 60 t , which is experimentally quite demanding .",
    "we believe that a measurement of @xmath8 at high frequencies in the pseudogap state above @xmath0 should have a similar behavior at @xmath9 as @xmath7 does .",
    "we expect that the high frequency behavior at @xmath10 will be similar to the @xmath11 behavior with superconductivity destroyed by a magnetic field if both experiments probe the same underlying state  which we believe is the ddw state  which causes the pseudogap and coexists with superconductivity in the underdoped superconducting state .",
    "given that the ddw state is a broken symmetry state with a local order parameter , it should be describable by a mean field hartree - fock theory and its consequent elementary excitations .",
    "this is precisely the approach we shall assume in the present paper .",
    "the mean field hamiltonian for the ddw state is @xmath12,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the annihilation operator for an electron of spin @xmath14 in the @xmath15-direction and momentum @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the chemical potential , and the vector @xmath18 .",
    "the lattice spacing will be set to unity .",
    "we ignore the residual interactions between quasiparticles ; the principal effect of electron - electron interactions is to produce non - zero @xmath19 .    the single particle spectrum on the square lattice with nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath20 and next - neighbor hopping @xmath21 is @xmath22 the @xmath1-wave order parameter of the ddw state is @xmath23 where the amplitude @xmath24 is a function of doping .",
    "we can express the hamiltonian in terms of a two - component quasiparticle operator : @xmath25 , and then diagonalize this @xmath26 hamiltonian to get @xmath27 & 0 \\\\ 0 & [ e_{-}({\\bf k})-\\mu ] \\end{array } \\right ) \\chi_{{\\bf k},\\alpha } .",
    "\\label{eq : twobytwo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the two - component quasiparticle operator @xmath28 is unitarily related to @xmath29 , and the sum is over the reduced brilloun zone ( rbz ) .",
    "@xmath30 are the two bands of the ordered ddw state , with @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "for a system of ddw quasiparticles in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath33 in the @xmath15-direction , and an electric field @xmath34 in the @xmath35 plane , @xmath5 is the angle between @xmath34 and the current @xmath36 : @xmath37 .",
    "we will compute the necessary conductivities , @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the framework of boltzmann theory@xcite applied to the ddw mean - field hamiltonian . since we consider a non - interacting model , this semiclassical approach easily generalizes to finite frequencies as well .",
    "a number of comments regarding the validity of our boltzmann approach are in order .    1 .   in a normal metal , it is well known ( see ref .  ) that the external frequency @xmath40 and wavevector @xmath41 must satisfy @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the fermi wavevector .",
    "although we must have @xmath45 for localization effects to be neglected ( @xmath46 is the mean free path ) , there are no further restrictions on the product @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the lifetime due to impurity scattering .",
    "2 .   in a superconductor ,",
    "the same conditions apply at high frequencies , unless we want to capture interesting order parameter disequilibrium effects , such as charge imbalance etc .",
    ", whence we must satisfy @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the superconducting gap.@xcite 3 .   for a particle - hole condensate , such as ddw , the condition for the validity of the boltzmann equation should be the same as in a normal metal .",
    "the diagonalization in eq .",
    "( [ eq : twobytwo ] ) does not mix particles and holes and , therefore , we can apply the boltzmann formalism to ddw quasiparticles , which have relatively simple , particle - number conserving scattering terms .",
    "we assume that ddw quasiparticles have only one scattering time , though it may vary along the fermi surface.@xcite this assumption is clearly supported by experiments , at least in the pseudogap regime of ybco@xmath51 for @xmath52.@xcite it surprisingly appears to be true for even very lightly doped sample of @xmath53.@xcite the alternate view that for each @xmath54 , there are two scattering times@xcite @xmath55 and @xmath56 appears to be untenable in this regime .",
    "( above the ddw ordering temperature , the situation may , of course , be more complicated . )",
    "further complications from interband transitions will be neglected , because , to a first approximation , the effect of these high frequency processes will be simply to renormalize the effective single band parameters .",
    "the longitudinal and hall conductivities , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , are :    @xmath59 \\delta(e_{+}(k)-\\mu ) + ( e_{+ } \\rightarrow e_{-})\\\\   & = & \\frac{2e^{3}h}{(2\\pi)^{2}\\hbar^{4}c}i_{xy}[\\omega,\\tau_{\\bf k } ] , \\label{eq : xy } \\\\",

    "the imaginary part of @xmath73 can therefore be determined in a largely model - independent manner  in this limit ,",
    "it is essentially a measure of fermi surface geometry @xcite  while the real part of @xmath74 involves the unknown parameter @xmath64 which can depend on many details .",
    "if we had replaced @xmath75 by its @xmath54 average over the fermi surface , @xmath48 , the expression for @xmath76 $ ] would have been exactly the same as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cot ] ) , regardless of the magnitude of the product @xmath47,@xcite but now there would have been a dissipative real part containing @xmath48 , that is , within this approximation : @xmath77",
    "with eq .",
    "( [ eq : wh ] ) in hand , we can now calculate @xmath2 as a function of @xmath3 in the ddw state .",
    "we choose a representative set of values for the needed parameters . in keeping with our analysis for the related quantity , @xmath78 , @xcite we choose @xmath79 ev , @xmath80 . for a comparison with experimental data ,",
    "it is necessary to choose an appropriate relation between the chemical potential @xmath17 and the doping @xmath3 .",
    "physically , this relation can be exceedingly complex in the underdoped regime , where a plethora of competing charge and spin ordered states can intervene as @xmath81 .",
    "we , therefore , do not discuss the behavior in this heavily underdoped regime , although in the past we have attempted to describe this regime by arguing that the chemical potential is perhaps pinned to zero.@xcite between the overdoped ( @xmath82 ) and the moderately underdoped regime ( @xmath83 ) , we make the simplest possible assumption that @xmath17 is a smooth function of @xmath3 .",
    "the actual function is not very significant , but to be concrete , we choose the relation implied by the band structure . to discuss the nonanalyticity close to @xmath84",
    ", we neglect the @xmath3 dependence of the chemical potential for simplicity , as the doping dependence of @xmath24 is much more important . for illustrative purposes",
    ", we take @xmath85 \\ ; \\text{ev } \\label{eq : w0}\\ ] ] with @xmath86 .",
    "this form gives mean - field - like nonanalyticity at @xmath9 .",
    "( the exponent @xmath87 can be replaced if , for instance , @xmath88 ising behavior is preferred . )",
    "it is also a reasonable representation of the form suggested in ref .  .",
    "we believe , however , that the final result is not strongly dependent on this particular detailed form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : w0 ] ) .     as the ddw gap is varied ( implicitly as a function of doping @xmath3 ) .",
    "proceeding clockwise from the left panel on the top , @xmath89 ; these numbers are for illustrative purposes only , and the @xmath17 was chosen so as to focus on the lower band only . ]    before doing an explicit calculation , it is revealing to plot the hole pockets as the amplitude of the ddw gap @xmath24 is increased for @xmath17 varying smoothly as a function of doping @xmath3 , in particular we show the results for a _",
    "fixed _ value of @xmath17 in fig .",
    "[ fig : cplot ] .",
    "one can see that the hole pockets become less elliptical as @xmath90 is increased at constant @xmath17 .",
    "so , even though @xmath17 is kept constant , with increasing @xmath90 below @xmath9 , the curvature of the holepockets increases where the fermi velocity is largest , @xcite consequently @xmath91 increases , and the perimeter decreases , so that @xmath92 decreases .",
    "@xcite the net result is an increase of @xmath93 .",
    "this is a robust explanation of the increase of @xmath93 as the system is underdoped in agreement with rigal _",
    "et al._@xcite     as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "the choices of the ddw gap amplitude and the chemical potential are described in the text . ]    to be quantitative , we explicitly calculate @xmath93 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : w0 ] ) and the band structure parameters given above .",
    "concomitantly , as mentioned above , @xmath17 was determined from the band structure .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : omega ] .",
    "the results are clearly consistent with the experiment of rigal _",
    "et al._@xcite the enhancement , as the system is underdoped , is significant , even though its actual magnitude is perhaps a factor of two smaller .",
    "moreover , the absolute magnitudes are well captured . beyond this , it is difficult to compare in detail .",
    "the experiment was performed on thin films of ybco for which we do not have the precise knowledge of the doping levels , nor do we have a good criterion to relate the doping with the chemical potential .",
    "to complicate matters further , the chain contributions in ybco are not included in our calculation , and these contributions were not subtracted in their experimental results .",
    "the parameters used here are generic ; it is possible to improve the agreement with the experiment by adjusting them , but we do not find this to be a very meaningful exercise .",
    "we then explore more closely the signature of the quantum critical point in the infrared hall angle , which is already evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : omega ] . to demonstrate the robustness of the quantum critical point , we set @xmath17 to be a constant , equal to @xmath94 and use the mean field ansatz @xmath95 . for a representative value , we take @xmath96 and @xmath86 .",
    "these are identical to our previous parametrizations.@xcite the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : omega2 ] .",
    "close to the quantum critical point @xmath97 , with @xmath17 set to a constant , equal to @xmath98 ev . ]    by examining the integrals @xmath91 and @xmath92 in more detail , we find that , close to the critical doping , @xmath99 , where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are constants , and the slope diverges at the transition .",
    "( at finite temperature , this will be rounded . )",
    "we emphasize that although the hot spots determine the critical singularity close to @xmath84,@xcite the increase of @xmath93 is determined by the evolution of the hole pockets and the gapping of the fermi surface as the doping is decreased .",
    "the hall angle measurements of rigal , _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite are strong evidence for the existence of hole pockets in the underdoped cuprates .",
    "we believe that ddw order is the simplest explanation which is also consistent with the absence of hole pockets in arpes .",
    "consistency with both of these experiments ( and the hall number measurement of ref . ) is a strong challenge of other proposals for the pseudogap .",
    "our analysis opens a number of interesting directions for future research .",
    "our calculation could be extended using the kubo formalism , which would have a wider region of validity .",
    "a more careful comparison between theory and experiment could be made with a better model for the chemical potential at the precise doping levels of the experiment .",
    "finally , further exploration of the putative quantum critical point at @xmath102 at which ddw order vanishes could more firmly establish its existence and its properties .",
