    ". the absence of a sharp decline phase may be just due to the fact that xrt observations started only at @xmath36 s , i.e. , the afterglow started earlier .",
    "such a possibility provides us an additional argument to classify the lat emission as post prompt emission .    in the optical and infrared bands , the only object suspected of being variable in the xrt fov",

    "here we use `` p7transient '' data so as to increase photon statistics .",

    "the weighted photon flux from grb  110625a  was calculated by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 represents the probability that the photon originates from the grb , normalized by the exposure .",
    "thus , the total number of counts , @xmath44 , is scaled by the factor @xmath47 to give rise to the weighted photon counts .",
    "the error bars were scaled by the same ratio . the background level for the weighted photon flux",
    "is estimated by @xmath48 for each bin and was averaged over the whole period .",

    ", we fit the weighted light curve with a simple power law between @xmath38  s and @xmath32  s : @xmath49 , @xmath50 measured in seconds , and found the best fit parameters to be @xmath5110@xmath52  @xmath14s@xmath53 and @xmath5410@xmath55  @xmath14s@xmath56 , giving @xmath57d.o.f.@xmath58 .",
    "thus the light curve deviates from a simple power law decay at the level of 96.77% .",
    "the ratios @xmath59 are shown in fig .",

    "one can see that during @xmath60  s to @xmath61  s and @xmath62  s to @xmath63  s , the contribution from grb  110625a is higher than the background , since @xmath64 . as an alternative algorithm , we have also assigned each photon to either grb  110625a  or background depending on whether @xmath65 ( grb  110625a ) or @xmath66 ( background ) and calculated the ratio of the number of photons from grb  110625a  and those from background .",
    "this method gives consistent results .",
    "the existence of two emission epochs from grb  110625a  was first noted in  @xcite and characterized by  @xcite .",
    "fitting the light curve with two gaussian profiles on top of a baseline emission , the peaks and widths of the first and second emission epochs are given by @xmath67  s and @xmath68  s , and by @xmath69  s and @xmath70  s , respectively .",
    "therefore , the two emission epochs are roughly @xmath71  s to @xmath72  s and @xmath73  s to @xmath74  s.    we then performed unbinned maximum - likelihood analyses ( _ gtlike _ ) of a 15@xmath75-roi centered at the xrt position to characterize the detection significance and spectrum of the @xmath76100  mev @xmath0-rays  from grb  110625a .",

    "we subtracted the background contribution by including the galactic diffuse model ( gal_2yearp7v6_v0.fits ) .",
    "contributions from other sources ( including the isotropic background ) are negligible and not included .",
    "the spectral index of the grb and normalization values of all three components were set free in the likelihood analysis .",

    "@xmath78 286@xmath7951 and declination ( j2000 ) @xmath78 6@xmath7986 with statistical uncertainty of 0@xmath7944 , which is consistent with the xrt position .",
    "the systematic uncertainty should be @xmath800@xmath796 based on grb  080825c which also occurred at large inclination angle at the grb onset  @xcite .",
    "performing unbinned maximum - likelihood analyses ( _ gtlike _ ) of the same 15@xmath75-roi for different time bins , we produced the background - subtracted light curve , as shown in figure  [ flux ] .",

    "limited photon statistics do not allow any meaningful analysis on these @xmath140  s periods .",
    "the period in - between ( ii ) during which no emission was detected is plotted as a 90% confidence - level upper limit . the burst position entered the lat fov again after @xmath83  ks .",
    "no emission was detected and we derived upper limits for these late epochs as well .",

    "no flaring behavior is present in the x - ray light curve .",
    "the spectral properties of the gev emission for different times are summarized in table  [ lat_spec ] .",
    "there is no significant spectral change between periods ( i ) and ( iii ) , as opposed to preliminary results presented by  @xcite , who found that the spectrum for the second emission period was much softer than the first period ( we were able to reproduce the same results by using pass6 data ) .",

    "s , the time of the strong gev emission , we have @xmath109 hz and the corresponding cooling lorentz factor @xmath110 . to account for the gev spectrum one needs a typical energy of seed photons as low as @xmath111 , which rules out the possibility that the gev afterglow is dominated by the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) radiation of the external forward shock .",
    "the synchrotron radiation of the forward shock electrons may produce prominent gev emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as shown in fig.3 , the gev emission could be the high - energy tail of the synchrotron radiation component as long as the spectrum @xmath112 holds in the energy range from 0.2 kev to @xmath113 mev .",
    "such a peculiar spectrum suggests a @xmath114 mev , requiring @xmath115 , where we have taken the expression of @xmath95 by yost et al .",
    "alternatively , one can imagine that there was a far - infrared flare and the forward shock electrons were cooled by the flare photons , producing a gev radiation component via the inverse compton scattering .",
    "these two kinds of processes may be able to account for some properties of the gev emission ( e.g. , the spectrum and the flux ) but possibly not the temporal behavior .",

    ", i.e. , @xmath117 ) and then examine the possibility that the gev emission is the ssc radiation of an underlying ultraviolet ( uv ) flare with a peak energy @xmath118 ev and a spectrum @xmath119 for @xmath120 ( as already mentioned in sect .  3",
    ", there was no flaring behavior in x - ray band ) . in the grb afterglow , optical",
    "/ ultraviolet flares could be powered via the so - called late internal shocks , as observed for example in grb 080129 @xcite .",

    "@xmath126 suggests that the outflow is baryonic and the magnetic field in the emitting region is shock - generated .",

    ", three more requirements should be satisfied : ( i ) the flare emission in x - ray band should be lower than the forward shock x - ray emission ; ( ii ) @xmath130 still holds in the flare phase , in which the forward shock electrons suffer additional cooling by the uv photons ; ( iii ) the gev photons are not absorbed via pair production on the high energy tail of the flare or on the ssc mev photons .",
    "the first requirement is satisfied since the observed x - ray luminosity at @xmath108 s is @xmath131 erg / s while the emission of the uv flare in the x - ray band is @xmath132 erg / s .",
    "the second requirement is met as long as the interstellar medium surrounding the burst has a number density @xmath133 and @xmath134 ( it is straightforward to draw this conclusion with eq.(2 ) and eq.(5 ) of fan & piran 2006 ) . substituting the current physical parameters into eq.(43 ) of fan et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , it is straightforward to show that the absorption by pair production on the high energy tail of the flare can be ignored . the absorption by pair production on the ssc mev photons can be calculated in a rather similar way and is found to be not serious .",
    "for @xmath135 and @xmath136 for @xmath137 , we just need to replace the expression of the term @xmath138 in eq.(43 ) of fan et al .",

    "] in other words , the third requirement is also satisfied . therefore we conclude that the ssc radiation of an underlying bright uv flare could account for the gev radiation from @xmath152 s to @xmath153  s. the weak gev emission in the time interval @xmath154 s may be interpreted in the same scenario .",
    "grb  110625a  is the third grb detected by fermi / lat and swift / xrt simultaneously .",
    "we have shown that the gev light curve differs from a simple power - law decay , and probably consists of two emission periods .",
    "the rapid decrease of gev flux during both periods challenges the notion that the emission comes from the external forward shock . while in the case of grb  100728a ,",
    "late - time x - ray flares seem to accompany the gev emission , no such flares are seen in the time frame during which gev emission was detected .",
