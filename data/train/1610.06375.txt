    "galaxies come in a wide variety of sizes , shapes , and masses , yet their structural properties obey a number of scaling relations  hinting at an underlying simplicity to the seemingly haphazard process of galaxy formation in a hierarchical universe .",

    "the dynamics was traced by the linewidth of the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen ( ) for spiral galaxies , and by the stellar velocity dispersion for elliptical galaxies .",
    "in more recent studies , luminosity has been replaced by stellar or baryonic ( defined as stars plus neutral gas ) mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , with these relations often being referred to as the stellar and baryonic tully - fisher relations , respectively . in order to put all types of galaxies onto the same relation circular velocities measured at the same fiducial radius",

    "a contributor to this problem is when simulated galaxies are too compact .",
    "however , @xcite showed that when models are constrained to reproduce the sizes of galaxies , they also over - predict the circular velocities if haloes contract in response to galaxy formation @xcite .",

    "one of the key results of these studies is that star formation is inefficient .",

    "the efficiency drops even further .",
    "the scatter in stellar mass at fixed halo mass is hard to quantify observationally ( since halo masses can not be reliably measured for individual galaxies ) , but it is estimated to be small , @xmath13 dex , and independent of halo mass @xcite .",
    "note that the scatter in halo mass at fixed stellar mass is not a constant , rather it increases with stellar mass due to the shallowing slope of the @xmath14 relation at high halo masses .",
    "likewise , the observed scatter in the tf relation is small @xmath13 dex in mass ( or luminosity ) at fixed velocity @xcite .",
    "the maximum scatter in the stellar - to - halo mass ratio allowed by the tf relation is slightly larger than the observed scatter , since variation in stellar - to - halo mass partially moves galaxies along the tf relation @xcite .",
    "however , contributions from variation in dark halo concentrations , stellar mass - to - light ratios ( both intrinsic variations and measurement uncertainties ) reduce the allowed scatter to less than 0.2 dex .",
    "the best tracer of halo masses for individual galaxies comes from galaxy rotation velocities at large galactic radii from the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen .",
    "the baryonic tully - fisher relation ( btf ) is a correlation between the baryonic mass of a galaxy , @xmath15 , ( stars plus cold gas ) and the rotation velocity at large radii , @xmath16 , ( typically in the flat part of the rotation curve ) .",
    "it is an extension of the original linewidth - luminosity relation of @xcite .",
    "since the observed rotation velocity is related to the halo virial velocity @xcite , the btf provides the most direct observational constraint on the efficiency of galaxy formation .",

    "given the tentative discrepancy we find between theory and observation at low velocities ( @xmath90 ) it will be interesting to study them further . both to refine the predictions and obtain larger observational samples .",
    "an important consideration is that the rotation curves rise more slowly than in high mass galaxies ( see fig .",

    "we fit each relation with a power - law over the full velocity range .",

    "the shallowest relation in each panel involves the total available baryonic mass ( magenta ) , which by definition has a slope of 3 in the lower left panel .",

    "all these relations are steeper than the corresponding relations using @xmath55 . note also that lower mass haloes have retained a smaller fraction of their baryons ( compare red and magenta points and lines , see also * ? ? ?",
    "the scatter increases as we go from the total baryonic mass ( red crosses ) , to the galactic baryonic mass ( blue circles ) , to the stellar mass ( black squares ) , and finally to the neutral gas mass ( green triangles ) . this supports the notion that the baryonic mass is a more fundamental galaxy property than either stellar or gas mass .",
    "the lower left panel shows results using the maximum circular velocity from the dmo simulation , @xmath57 , while the lower right panel uses the virial circular velocity from the dmo simulation , @xmath7 .",
    "the slopes are slightly steeper with @xmath7 than @xmath6 due to increased mass loss from lower mass haloes , and steeper still using @xmath57 because lower mass haloes have higher @xmath93 due to the higher average concentrations ( recall the concentration vs velocity relation for cdm haloes goes like @xmath94 ) .    comparing the different panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : mvall ] we see that stellar mass correlates better with maximum halo velocity than virial velocity , while cold gas mass , and total baryonic mass correlates better with virial velocity than maximum velocity .",
    "thus there is no single velocity definition that minimizes the scatter in all baryonic components .",
    "the halo abundance matching technique is a powerful way to link the masses of galaxies to the masses of dark matter haloes , under the assumption of @xmath70 and cosmological parameters @xcite .",

    "using observations of the projected two - point galaxy clustering @xcite showed that the peak circular velocity of the dark matter halo ( over the history of a halo ) is more closely related to stellar mass than the virial velocity of the halo .",
    "maximum circular velocity ( either at a given time , or over the history of a halo ) is often preferred over halo mass ( or virial velocity ) because ( 1 ) does not depend on the ( somewhat arbitrary ) definition of halo mass , ( 2 ) is less sensitive to the mass stripping that sub - haloes experience , ( 3 ) probes a smaller scale which presumably has more to do with galaxy formation than the virial scale .    in our galaxy formation simulations",
    "we indeed find that the maximum circular velocity ( at the present day ) of the dark matter only simulation yields a smaller global scatter ( 0.20 dex ) in stellar mass than the virial velocity ( 0.25 dex ) of the hydro or dmo simulation ( fig .",
