    "eigenvalue distributions of wishart random matrices arise in many fields .",
    "prominent examples include wireless communication systems @xcite , synthetic aperture radar ( sar ) signal processing @xcite , econometrics @xcite , statistical physics @xcite , and multivariate statistical analysis @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "the wishart matrices of interest are complex @xcite , correlated , and non - central .",
    "such matrices arise , for example , in multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) communication channels characterized by line - of - sight components ( i.e. ,  rician fading ) with spatial correlation amongst the antenna elements @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "a main focus is on the distributions of the _ extreme _ eigenvalues ( i.e. , maximum and minimum ) of wishart matrices , which arise in many areas .",
    "for example , in the context of contemporary wireless communication systems , the maximum eigenvalue distribution is instrumental to the analysis of mimo multi - channel beamforming systems @xcite and the analysis of mimo maximal ratio combining receivers @xcite , whereas the minimum eigenvalue distribution is important for the design and analysis of adaptive mimo multiplexing - diversity switching systems @xcite , as well as the analysis of linear mimo receiver structures @xcite . in the context of econometrics ,",
    "the minimum eigenvalue of a non - central wishart matrix is important for characterizing the weak instrument asymptotic distribution of the cragg - donald statistic @xcite . in statistical physics ,",
    "information pertaining to the nature of entanglement of a random pure quantum state can be obtained from the two extreme eigenvalue densities of wishart matrices @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the maximal and minimal height distributions of @xmath7 non - intersecting fluctuating interfaces at the thermal equilibrium and with a certain external potential are also related to the extreme eigenvalues of a wishart matrix @xcite . as a final example , in sar signal processing , the probability density of the maximum eigenvalue a wishart matrix is an important parameter for target detection and analysis @xcite .",
    "we focus primarily on correlated complex non - central wishart matrices , as well as another important and closely related class of random matrices , which we refer to _ gamma - wishart_. such matrices arise in the context of mimo land mobile satellite ( lms ) communication systems @xcite , and correspond to non - central wishart matrices with a random non - centrality matrix having a distribution which is intimately related to the matrix - variate gamma . as discussed in @xcite , the eigenvalues of gamma - wishart random matrices are important for the design and analysis of mimo lms systems ; for example , the maximum eigenvalue density determines the performance of beamforming transmission techniques , whereas the minimum eigenvalue density is closely related to the performance of linear reception techniques .",
    "recently , the marginal eigenvalue distributions of random matrices have received much attention ; for surveys , see @xcite . for the extreme eigenvalues , distributional results are now available for correlated central , uncorrelated central , and uncorrelated noncentral complex wishart matrices ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "far less is known for gamma - wishart matrices , other than the results in @xcite , which deal exclusively with uncorrelated matrices . in the majority of cases ,",
    "the standard approach has been to integrate the respective joint eigenvalue densities over suitably chosen multi - dimensional regions . for the more general class of complex non - central wishart and gamma - wishart matrices with _ non - trivial correlation _ however , there appears to be no tractable existing results . for these matrices , as we will show , the joint eigenvalue densities are extremely complicated , and it seems that this direct approach can not be easily undertaken to yield meaningful results .    in this paper , by employing an alternative derivation technique ( also considered in @xcite ) which allows us to deal with the joint matrix - variate density rather than the density of the eigenvalues , we derive new exact expressions for the cumulative distribution functions ( c.d.f.s ) of the minimum and maximum eigenvalues of correlated complex non - central wishart and correlated gamma - wishart random matrices . in both cases , whilst a general theory which accounts for all matrix dimensions and distributional parameters appears intractable , we are able to derive solutions for various important scenarios . specifically , for correlated non - central wishart matrices , we derive expressions for the minimum eigenvalue c.d.f.s when the matrix dimensionality and the number of degrees of freedom are equal .",
    "we also derive results for some specific scenarios for which they are not equal , and present some analogous results for the maximum eigenvalue c.d.f . for tractability",
    ", we focus on matrices with rank - one non - centrality parameter , which is practical for various applications ; most notably , mimo communication systems with a direct line - of - sight path between the transmitter and receiver . given the overwhelming complexity of the underlying joint eigenvalue distribution , these extreme eigenvalue c.d.f .",
    "expressions are remarkably simple , involving infinite series with fast convergence , and they can be easily and efficiently computed .    for the case of gamma - wishart matrices , we focus on scenarios for which the underlying matrix - variate gamma has an integer parameter",
    ". the implications of this assumption from a telecommunications engineering perspective are discussed in @xcite . as for the non - central wishart case ,",
    "we derive exact expressions for the minimum and maximum eigenvalue distributions for certain gamma - wishart particularizations .    whilst previous expressions pertaining to the non - central wishart case have been reported in @xcite ; those are very complicated , involving either infinite series with inner summations over partitions with each term involving invariant zonal polynomials ( c.f .",
    "section [ sec : prelim ] ) , or infinite series with special functions of matrix arguments @xcite . as such",
    ", those previous results have limited utility from a numerical computation perspective .",
