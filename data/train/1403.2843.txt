    "in 1965 @xcite , shafarevich introduced the notions of infinite - dimensional varieties and infinite - dimensional algebraic groups , now usually called ind - varieties and ind - groups .",
    "his main motivation was to study the group @xmath1 of polynomial automorphisms of complex affine @xmath2-spaces @xmath3 , which he endowed with an ind - group structure .",
    "this new approach was fruitful , since it allows him to state many nice ( and tempting ) results in @xcite . in the present paper , we are interested in one that claims that the tame automorphisms form a dense subgroup @xmath4 of @xmath1 .",
    "unfortunately , shafarevich s proof is based on another result ",
    "namely that a closed subgroup @xmath5 of a connected ind - group @xmath6 with the same lie algebra as @xmath6 is equal to @xmath6  , which turns out to be false , since furter and kraft constructed recently a counterexample to that statement in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we must reconsider the question of the density of the tame subgroup and ask it again .",
    "is @xmath4 dense in @xmath1 in the topology of ind - varieties ( for @xmath7 ) ?",
    "moreover , furter and kraft also establish the following surprising result : the subgroup @xmath8)$ ] of tame automorphisms of @xmath0 that fix the last coordinate is a closed subgroup of the group @xmath9)$ ] of polynomial automorphisms of @xmath0 that fix the last coordinate . in light of this , and since there were no known examples of non - tame automorphism that belong to the closure of the tame subgroup , we may even ask if the tame subgroup is closed in @xmath1 .    is @xmath4 closed in @xmath1 in the topology of ind - varieties ( for @xmath7 ) ?    we will show that it is not the case , when @xmath10 of course , since it is the only case where the existence of non - tame automorphisms is proved .",
    "we indeed construct families of tame automorphisms of @xmath0 of bounded degrees which degenerate to wild ( i.e.  non - tame ) automorphisms .",
    "in particular , we will prove that the automorphism @xmath11 of @xmath0 defined by @xmath12 is not tame but is in the closure of the tame subgroup of @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath11 is the limit , when @xmath13 , of the tame automorphism @xmath14 of @xmath15 , which is given by @xmath16 and which has all its coefficient in @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "this example illustrates a new phenomenon concerning the _ length _ of tame automorphisms .",
    "recall that the length of a ( tame ) automorphism @xmath18 of @xmath19 is the minimum number of triangular automorphisms that occur in a writing of @xmath18 as composition of affine and triangular automorphisms .",
    "recall also that furter proved in  @xcite that the length of automorphisms of the affine plane is lower semicontinuous .",
    "that means that an automorphism of @xmath20 of length @xmath21 can not be obtained as the limit of automorphisms of length @xmath22 .",
    "in contrast , in the above example , @xmath11 is an automorphism of @xmath0 of infinite length ( because it is non - tame ) , which is the limit of the family @xmath14 of automorphisms of length 3 .    the article is organized as follow .",
    "we fix some notations and recall the definition of tame automorphisms in section [ sec - notations ] . in section  [ sec - limits ] , we recall why the group @xmath1 of polynomial automorphisms of @xmath19 has the structure of an infinite - dimensional affine algebraic variety and study the subset of @xmath23 which consists of all `` limits '' of tame automorphisms . in particular , we show that the set of tame automorphisms of @xmath0 of degree at most @xmath24 is a constructible set in @xmath23 for all @xmath25 .",
    "finally , we give concrete examples of non - tame automorphisms which belong to the closure of the tame subgroup in section  [ sec - examples ] .",

    "an element @xmath47 is simply an invertible polynomial map from @xmath32 to @xmath32 whose inverse @xmath48 is also a polynomial map .",

    "an element of @xmath54 is called _ wild_. the tame generators problem asks for the existence of such automorphisms in the case where @xmath55 is a field .",
    "[ que : tgp]does it hold that @xmath56 ?    when @xmath57 , the answer is trivially yes . when @xmath58 , the answer is also positive by the famous jung - van der kulk s theorem ( cf .",

    "for example , the famous nagata automorphism @xmath69 is a wild automorphism of @xmath0 .",

    "we will now recall how one can see @xmath1 as an ind - variety ( i.e.  infinite dimensional algebraic variety ) and which topology we consider on it . to this purpose , it is convenient to work with a fixed integer @xmath72 ( for us , it will be @xmath10 ) and to let @xmath73 .",
    "then , we consider the filtration on @xmath74 given by the degree and we define for every @xmath25 the subset @xmath75 of polynomial automorphisms of degree at most @xmath24 . more generally , a subset @xmath76 be given , we let @xmath77    one can show ( see e.g.  @xcite ) that each @xmath78 has the structure of an affine algebraic variety and is closed in @xmath79 in the zariski topology . therefore , @xmath80 is an ind - variety in the sense of shafarevich . as usual",
    ", we endow it with the ind - topology in which a subset @xmath81 is closed if and only if every subset @xmath82 is closed in @xmath78 in the zariski topology .    in the present paper , we focus our attention on the subset of tame automorphisms of affine three - space , which we will denote by @xmath83 in the sequel .",
    "we would like to investigate which automorphisms of @xmath0 can be obtain as limits of such tame automorphisms in the following sense .",
    "let @xmath81 be a subset and let @xmath84 .",
    "we say that @xmath31 is _ limit _ of elements of @xmath85 if there exist a positive integer @xmath25 and a subset @xmath86 which is locally closed in @xmath78 such that @xmath87 .",
    "following @xcite , we say that a subset @xmath81 is _ weakly closed _ if @xmath85 contains all limits of elements of @xmath85 .",
    "together with a valuative criterion due to furter @xcite , theorem  [ thm - su - decomposition ] allows us to make this definition of limit more concrete in the case of tame automorphisms of @xmath0 ( see corollary  [ cor - valuatif ] below ) .",
    "this result follows from the theory of shestakov and umirbaev , which provides an algorithm to decompose every tame automorphism of @xmath0 as a product of affine and triangular maps .",
    "[ thm - su - decomposition ] for each @xmath88 , there exist positive integers @xmath89 and @xmath90 , depending only on @xmath24 , such that every tame automorphism @xmath91 of @xmath0 of degree at most @xmath24 can be written as a composition @xmath92 , where each @xmath34 is either affine , or a triangular automorphism of @xmath0 of degree at most @xmath28 .",
    "the proof is based on shestakov - umirbaev theory of reduction of tame automorphisms of @xmath0 .",
    "these reductions involve affine and elementary automorphisms .",
    "let us recall that an automorphism @xmath31 of @xmath19 is called _ elementary automorphism _ if it is of the form @xmath93 for some @xmath94 and some polynomial @xmath95 $ ] which does not depend on the variable @xmath96 .",
    "we denote by @xmath97 the set of elementary automorphisms of @xmath0 and by @xmath98 the subset of those which are of degree at most @xmath24 .",
    "remark that a triangular automorphism of @xmath0 of degree @xmath24 is equal to the composition of one affine automorphism and two elements of @xmath98 .    in @xcite shestakov and umirbaev did not consider the usual degree for a polynomial automorphism @xmath31 , but the one that is given by the sum of the degrees of the components of @xmath31 .",
    "let us denote it by @xmath99 .",
    "so , we let @xmath100 for all automorphism @xmath101 of @xmath0 .",
    "according to the theory developed in @xcite , for every non - affine tame automorphism @xmath31 of @xmath0 , one of the following properties holds :    1 .",
    "@xmath31 admits an elementary reduction , i.e.  there exists an elementary automorphism @xmath102 such that @xmath103 .",
    "2 .   @xmath31 admits a reduction of type i or ii and then , there exist an elementary automorphism @xmath102 and an affine one @xmath104 such that @xmath105 .",

    "actually , shestakov and umirbaev also considered another kind of reduction , called of type iv . but kuroda proved that this one never occurs ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , any tame automorphism @xmath91 can be reduced to an affine automorphism by using at most @xmath108 reductions as above .",
    "so , to conclude the proof , it only remains to show that all elementary maps that appear in a decomposition of an element of @xmath109 can be taken with degrees bounded by a number @xmath90 which depends only on @xmath24 .",

    "since @xmath139 , we obtain @xmath140 and @xmath141 thus , @xmath142 is bounded by a constant depending only on @xmath24 , as desired .",
    "finally , it remains to consider the case where @xmath31 admits a reduction of type i , ii or iii . let us write @xmath143 if f admits a reduction of type i or ii and @xmath144 if f admits a reduction of type iii .",
    "furthermore , it follows from the precise definitions in @xcite that @xmath145 is a @xmath129-reduced pair and that @xmath146 admits an elementary reduction @xmath147 such that @xmath148 . by the previous discussion",
    ", we can conclude that @xmath149 .",
