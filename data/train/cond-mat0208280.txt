    "the replica method @xcite , originally devised as a trick to compute thermodynamical quantities of physical systems in presence of quenched disorder , has found applications in the analysis of systems of very different nature , as neural networks , combinatorial optimization problems @xcite , error correction codes @xcite etc .    although many physicists believe that the method , within the replica symmetry breaking scheme of parisi @xcite , is able to potentially give the exact solution of any problem treatable as a mean field theory , the necessary mathematical foundation of the theory is still lacking , after more then 20 years from its introduction in theoretical physics .",
    "the last times have seen a growing interest of the mathematical community in the method , leading to important but still partial results , confirming in certain cases the replica analysis , with more conventional and well established techniques @xcite .",
    "apart the remarkable exception of the analysis of the fully connected @xmath0-spin model in ref . @xcite and the rigorous analysis of random energy models @xcite",
    ", the analysis of the mathematicians has been , as far as we know , restricted to the high temperature regions and/or to problem of replica symmetric nature .",
    "very welcomed have been the techniques recently introduced by guerra and toninelli @xcite which allow rigorous analysis not relying on the assumption of high temperature , and valid even in problems with replica symmetry breaking . along these lines ,",
    "an important step towards the rigorous comprehension of the replica method , has been undertaken in @xcite , where it has been shown how in the case of the sherrington - kirkpatrick model , and its @xmath0-spin generalizations , the replica free - energies with arbitrary number of replica symmetry breaking steps constitute variational lower bounds to the true free - energy of the model .",
    "as stated in that paper , the analysis is restricted to fully - connected models , whose replica mean field theory can be formulated in terms of a single @xmath1 matrix . however , in recent times , many of the more interesting problems analyzed with replica theory pertain to the so called `` diluted models '' where each degree of freedom interacts with a finite number of neighbors .",
    "the introduction of a `` population dynamics algorithm '' @xcite has allowed to treat in full generality -within statistical precision- complicated sets of probabilistic functional equations appearing in the one step symmetry broken framework of diluted models .",
    "the same algorithm has been used as a starting point of a generalized `` belief propagation '' algorithm for optimization problems @xcite .",
    "furthermore , at the analytic level , simplifications due to graph homogeneities in some cases @xcite , and to the vanishing temperature limit in some other cases @xcite have led to supposedly exact solutions of the ground state properties of diluted models , culminated in the resolution of the random xor - sat on uniform graphs in @xcite and the random k - sat problem in @xcite within the framework of `` one - step replica symmetry breaking '' ( 1rsb ) .",
    "the aim of this paper , is to show that the replica analysis of diluted models provides lower bounds for the exact free - energy density , and ground state energy density .",
    "we analyze in detail the cases of the diluted @xmath0-spin model on the poissonian degree hyper - graphs also known as random xor - sat problem and the random k - sat problems .",
    "we expect that along similar lines free - energy lower bounds can be found for many other diluted cases .",
    "the guerra method we use sheds some light on the meaning of the replica mean field theory . the physical idea behind the method is that within mean field theory one can modify the original hamiltonian weakening the strength of the interaction couplings or removing them partially or totally , and compensate this removal by some auxiliary external fields . in disordered systems",
    "these fields should be random fields , taken from appropriate probability distributions and possibly correlated with the original values of the quenched variables eliminated from the systems .",
    "one is then led to consider hamiltonians interpolating between the original model and a pure paramagnet in a random field , and by means of these models achieving free - energy lower bounds .",
    "we will see that the rs case corresponds to assuming independence between the random fields and the quenched disorder .",
    "the parisi rsb scheme , assumes at each breaking level a peculiar kind of correlations , and gives free - energy bounds improving the rs one .",
    "our paper is organized in this way : in section 2 we introduce some notations that will be extensively used in the following sections . in section 3",
    "we introduce the general strategy to get the replica bounds ; we then specialize to the replica symmetric and the one step replica symmetry broken bounds , giving the results in the @xmath0-spin and the @xmath2-sat cases .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section 4 . in the appendices some details of the calculations in both the @xmath0-spin and",
    "the @xmath2-sat cases are shown .",
    "our results will be issue of explicit calculations .",
    "although at the end we will get bounds , formalizable as mathematical theorems , the style and most of the notations of the paper will be the ones of theoretical physics .",
    "the spin models we will consider in this work are defined by a collection of @xmath3 ising @xmath4 spins @xmath5 , interacting through hamiltonians of the kind @xmath6 where the indices @xmath7 are i.i.d",
    ". quenched random variables chosen uniformly in @xmath8 .",
    "we will call each term @xmath9 a clause .",
    "the subscript @xmath10 in the clauses indicates the dependence on a single or a set of quenched random variables , as it will be soon clear .",
    "the number of clauses @xmath11 will be taken to be proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "for convenience we will choose it to be for each sample a poissonian number with distribution @xmath12 .",
    "the fluctuations of @xmath11 will not affect the free - energy in the thermodynamic limit , and this choice , which slightly simplify the analysis , will be equivalent to choosing a fixed value of @xmath11 equal to @xmath13 .",
    "the clauses themselves will be random .",
    "the @xmath0-spin model@xcite has clauses of the form @xmath14 this form reduces to @xmath15 in the case of the viana - bray spin glass @xmath16 . in both cases the @xmath17",
    "will be taken as i.i.d .",
    "random variable with regular symmetric distribution @xmath18 .",
    "notice that for @xmath19 $ ] the model reduces to the random xor - sat problem @xcite of computer science .",
    "the random k - sat clauses have the form @xcite @xmath20 where the @xmath21 are i.i.d . with symmetric probability .",
    "( the number @xmath0 of spin appearing in a clause is usually called @xmath2 in the k - sat problem , for uniformity of notation we will deviate from this convention ) .",
    "notice that in all cases , on average each spin participate to @xmath22 clauses , and that the set of spins and interactions defines a random diluted hyper - graph of uniform rank @xmath0 and random local degree with poissonian statistics in the thermodynamic limit . at high enough temperature ,",
    "the existence of the free - energy in the thermodynamic limit for models of this kind has been proved in by talagrand in @xcite , together with the validity of the rs solution . a proof valid at all temperature based on the ideas presented in this paper ,",
    "can be obtained for even @xmath0 in analogy of the analysis in @xcite for long range models .",
    "we sketch it in appendix c in the case of the @xmath0-spin model .    in establishing the free - energy bounds we will need several kind of averages :    * the boltzmann - gibbs average for fixed quenched disorder : given an observable @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the inverse temperature .",
    "+ obviously , @xmath27 , as well as @xmath28 will be functions of the quenched variables , the size of the system and the temperature . this dependence will be made explicit only when needed . *",
    "the disorder average : given an observable quantity @xmath29 dependent on the quenched variables appearing in the hamiltonian , we will denote as @xmath30 its average .",
    "this will include the average with respect to the @xmath31 variables and the choice of the random indices in the clauses as well as with respect to other quenched variables to be introduced later .",
    "* we will need in several occasion the `` replica measure '' @xmath32 and some generalizations that we will specify later .",
    "* we will occasionally use other kinds of averages , as well as other notations , for which we will use an angular bracket notation , with a subscript indicating the variable(s ) over which the average is performed .",
    "e.g. an average over a random variable @xmath33 with probability distribution @xmath34 will be denoted equivalently as @xmath35 .",
    "analogously , averages over distribution families of @xmath36 will be denoted as @xmath37 .",
    "subscripts will be omitted whenever confusion is not possible . *",
    "another notation we will have the occasion to use in the one for the overlaps among @xmath38 spin configurations @xmath39 , out of a population of @xmath40 @xmath41 : @xmath42 and in particular @xmath43 this notation will be extended to multi - overlaps in the 1rsb case , as we will specify in section [ tarta ] .    in the following",
    "we will need to consider averages where some of the variables are excluded , e.g. the averages when a variable @xmath44 is erased .",
    "these average will be denoted with a subscript @xmath45 e.g. if an @xmath46 average is concerned the notation will be @xmath47 .",
    "other notations will be defined later in the text whenever needed .",
    "our interest will be confined to bounds to the free - energy density @xmath48 and the ground state energy density @xmath49 $ ] valid in the thermodynamic limit , so that @xmath50 will be often implicitly neglected in our calculations .",
    "the strategy to get the replica bound is a generalization of the one introduced by guerra in the case of fully connected models @xcite",
    ". we will consider models which will interpolate between the original ones we want to analyze and pure paramagnet in random fields with suitably chosen distribution .",
    "the underlying idea is that , given the mean field nature of the models involved , if one was able to reconstruct the real local fields acting on a given spin variable via a given hyper - edge , and to introduce auxiliary fields acting on that variable in such a way to energetically balance the deletion of the hyper - edge , then it would be possible to have an exact expression for the free - energy in terms of such auxiliary fields even when the whole edge set was emptied .",
    "however , if the replacement is done with some approximate form of the auxiliary fields distribution function , the real free - energy will be the one calculated using the approximate fields plus an excess term at every step of the graph deletion process .",
    "the proof of the definite sign of this excess term gives a way to determine bounds for the thermodynamic quantities .",
    "we will prove the existence of replica lower bounds to the free - energy density of the p - spin model and the random k - sat problem . in this last case",
    "our result proves that the recent replica solution of @xcite gives a lower bound to the ground state energy and therefore an upper bound for the satisfiability threshold .",
    "the proofs will strictly hold in the @xmath51 limit , due to the presence of corrections of order @xmath52 in the calculated expressions for any finite size graph .",
    "moreover , our proofs will be restricted to the @xmath0-spin model the the k - sat with even @xmath0 . in the cases of odd @xmath0",
    "the same bound would hold if one could rely on some physically reasonable assumptions on the overlap distribution ( see below ) .",
    "our analysis will start from the tap equations for the models @xcite , and their probabilistic solutions implied by the cavity , or equivalently the replica method at various degrees of approximation .",
    "we will consider in particular the replica symmetric ( rs ) and one step replica symmetry broken solutions , but it should be clear from our analysis how to generalize to more steps of replica symmetry breaking . in the tap / cavity equations one singles out the contribution of the clauses and the sites to the free - energy and defines cavity fields @xmath53 and @xmath54",
    "respectively as the local field acting on the spin @xmath55 in absence of the clause @xmath56 and the local field acting on @xmath55 due to the presence of the clause @xmath56 only .",
