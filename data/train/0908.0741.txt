    "a large fraction of edge - on spiral galaxies have been observed to have boxy or peanut - shaped ( hereafter b / ps ) bulges . as the observations have improved and the samples have grown , the percentage of galaxies with these bulge shapes has increased from less than 20% @xcite to up to 45% @xcite . because the observed frequency of b / ps bulges is so high , significant effort has been invested in determining the formation mechanism responsible for these bulge shapes .",
    "@xcite and @xcite demonstrated that the accretion of satellite galaxies could result in a galaxy bulge looking boxy or peanut - shaped .",
    "the currently favored formation mechanism , however , is the buckling and subsequent vertical thickening of a bar ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this is a plausible explanation , as bars are known to be common features in disk galaxies .",

    "barred galaxies are also known to occur in a variety of environments . using a sample of 930 galaxies",
    ", @xcite showed that the presence of a bar does not depend on whether the galaxy is in the field or is a member of a group or a cluster .",
    "similarly , @xcite studied the bar frequency in isolated galaxies and found roughly equal numbers of barred and unbarred systems .    to confirm the bar buckling hypothesis ,",
    "bars must be detected in edge - on galaxies with b / ps bulges . while bars can be easily seen in face - on galaxies , it is much more difficult , however , to unambiguously photometrically confirm the presence of a bar in an edge - on galaxy .",
    "this problem was simplified when @xcite and @xcite demonstrated that bars in edge - on galaxies could be detected kinematically from features like parallelograms and figures - of - eight in the position - velocity diagrams .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the complex kinematic and photometric features of the data are suggestive of a bar in the galaxy . although previous authors have observed ngc  2683 and linked its complex velocity structure and bulge shape with a bar , there has been little discussion about the bar orientation .",
    "in this paper we present our spectroscopic and photometric observations as evidence that ngc  2683 contains a bar that is 6@xmath1 on the sky away from the galaxy major axis . in @xmath2 2",

    "we describe in each section how these data support the hypothesis that a bar is present in the galaxy , and use the features of the kinematic and photometric signatures to constrain the orientation of the bar .",
    "the results for ngc  2683 are compared in @xmath2 6 with the results for m31 by @xcite .",
    "a comparison to m31 is insightful , as it has photometric and kinematic characteristics , as well as an inclination , that are similar to ngc  2683 .",
    "finally , a summary is presented in @xmath2 7 .",

    "the spectroscopic data showed trailing spiral arms , a [ ] /  ratio in the outer parts of the galaxy consistent with what is seen in hii regions ( [ ]  emission that is fainter than  emission ) , and strong evidence for deviations from circular motions .",
    "@xcite classified the bulge+disk shapes of 72 galaxies and categorized ngc  2683 as a bs - ii galaxy : a system in which the disk and bulge components are not sharply distinct and the bulge is an elongated ellipsoid that is sometimes rectangular .",

    "the pvd shows complex structure out to radii of @xmath7 45@xmath0 , almost half of its entire length . the  and [ ]  emission ( as well as the [ ] @xmath36717  and [ ] @xmath36731  emission that are not shown ) trace a parallelogram shape extending to @xmath7 45@xmath0 on each side .",
    "the edges of this region are relatively bright compared to the faint interior emission . at radii @xmath17 45@xmath0 ,",
    "the velocities are double , sometimes triple , valued .",
    "the maximum velocity reached is comparable to the velocities reached in the outer parts of the galaxy .",
    "the parallelogram velocities are seen to populate the `` forbidden '' quadrants of the pvd ; there are red - shifted velocities on the blue - shifted side of the galaxy and vice versa .",
    "there is also a second parallelogram feature seen in the pvd . in approximately the inner @xmath18 5@xmath0",
    "there is a steeper and more compact parallelogram that is brighter in the [ ] @xmath36584  emission than .",
    "the velocities reached in this region do not exceed the velocities in the more extended parallelogram or those of the outer disk , and there is a smooth transition between the compact , inner and extended , outer parallelogram - shaped features .",
    "this complex `` figure - of - eight '' pvd can be explained by the presence of a bar in the galaxy . in a series of papers , (",
    "* hereafter ba99 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ab99 ) , and ( * ? ?",
    "* hereafter ba05 ) used simulations of edge - on ( @xmath19 = 90@xmath1 ) galaxies to demonstrate that features in pvds like those shown in figure 1 can be explained by gas ( and stars ) moving in the _ x@xmath20 _ and _ x@xmath21 _ families of periodic orbits of barred potentials .",
    "each of these orbit families produces unique signatures in the pvd and , by virtue of the orientations of the orbits with respect to the bar , the appearance of the pvd features can be used to put constraints on the position angle of the bar .    , , and showed that in edge - on galaxies _ x@xmath20 _ orbits produce extended features in the pvd that range from bow tie - shaped to parallelogram - shaped depending on the orientation of the bar with respect to the observer s line - of - sight ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "x@xmath20 _ orbits are elongated parallel to the major axis of the bar , so that when the bar is viewed end - on , the line - of - sight is parallel to the major axis of both the bar and _ x@xmath20 _ orbits . viewed at this angle , the `` fast '' parts of the elongated _ x@xmath20 _ orbits are pointing directly toward or away from the observer and very high radial velocities at small projected distances are observed .",
    "this produces a bow tie - shaped feature in the pvd .",
    "when the bar is viewed side - on , the elongated axis of the _ x@xmath20 _ orbits is perpendicular to the line - of - sight .",
    "the `` slow '' parts of the _ x@xmath20 _ orbits are thus pointing directly toward or away from the observer , and as a result , much lower radial velocities are observed .",
    "in addition , because the long axis of the orbits is across the line - of - sight , these observed velocities will extend to larger projected distances than when the bar ( and _ x@xmath20 _ orbits ) is viewed end - on .",
    "the resulting feature in the pvd is therefore a relatively thin , diagonal band of velocities extending to large projected distances .",
    "when the bar in an edge - on galaxy is not viewed directly end - on or side - on , the pvd will contain a parallelogram - shaped feature with velocities appearing in the `` forbidden '' quadrants .",
    "this velocity structure arises because the orbits are elongated and not circular .",
    "the line - of - sight does not fall along either the major axis or minor axis of the orbits .",
    "thus , if they are viewed at an angle other than end - on or side - on , the positions along the orbits where the tangential velocity is greatest ( and radial velocity is zero ) will be offset from the center .",
    "this means that the velocities transition from being blue - shifted to red - shifted , and vice versa , at radii greater than zero .",
    "this leads to red(blue)-shifted velocities being observed on the blue(red)-shifted side of the galaxy , thus falling in the `` forbidden '' quadrants .",
    "the closer the bar is to end - on , the sharper and more peaked the parallelogram is at small projected radii ( and the more it looks like a bow tie ) .",
    "the interior of these pvds also tend to be brighter than the edges .",
    "as the bar angles closer to side - on , the corners of the parallelogram round out and the parallelogram becomes thinner as it extends to larger projected distances and rises to lower radial velocities .    in the observed pvd of ngc  2683",

    "the bright emission along the edges of the _ x@xmath20 _ parallelogram and a lack of clear central peaks suggest that the bar is oriented at an intermediate angle ( perhaps between 10@xmath1 and 45@xmath1 ) on the sky away from the galaxy major axis and therefore viewed closer to side - on than end - on .    at the center of the observed pvd of ngc  2683",
    "is the signature of the _ x@xmath21 _ orbits : a compact feature that is brighter in [ ] emission than  emission ( figure 1 ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "this relatively large [ ]  emission may be caused by the shocks that develop at the transition between the _ x@xmath20 _ and _ x@xmath21 _ orbits ( baldwin , phillips , & terlevich 1981 ; dopita & sutherland 1996 ; ab99 ) , as well as the agn that is known to be at the center of ngc  2683 @xcite . without additional diagnostic emission lines such as [ ]  or [ ] , we can not say for certain that it is the agn rather than shocks that is causing the bright [ ] emission .",
    "it is not uncommon for barred galaxies to host agn .",
    "@xcite observed a number of relatively face - on sb galaxies with large [ ] /  ratios and confirmed the presence of active nuclei .",
    "@xcite have also found that galaxies with active centers are more often barred ( 79% ) than galaxies without active nuclei ( 59% ) ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "x@xmath21 _ orbits are elongated perpendicular to the bar ( making them also perpendicular to the _ x@xmath20 _ orbits ) and are less radially extended than the _ x@xmath20 _ orbits",
    ". because the major axes of the _ x@xmath21 _ and _ x@xmath20 _ orbits are perpendicular , when one orbit family reaches its maximum radial velocity , the other is at its minimum .",
    "thus , the radial velocities of the _ x@xmath21 _ orbits peak when the bar is viewed side - on and are lowest when the bar is viewed end - on .    rather than using the shape of the _",
    "x@xmath21 _ feature in the pvd , advocate the ratio of the maximum observed radial velocity of the _ x@xmath21 _ orbits to the maximum velocity observed in the outer parts of the galaxy ( @xmath23/@xmath24 ) as the best measure of bar viewing angle . when the bar is viewed close to end - on , the maximum velocity of the _ x@xmath21 _ orbits will be low compared to the outer disk ( the line - of - sight is perpendicular to the elongated axis of the _ x@xmath21 _ orbits and the `` slow '' parts of the orbit are observed ) ; @xmath23/@xmath24 @xmath17 1 in this case .",
    "the `` fast '' parts of the _ x@xmath21 _ orbits are observed when the bar is viewed side - on ; it therefore follows that @xmath23/@xmath24 @xmath22 1 in this orientation . in ngc  2683 , we find that @xmath23/@xmath24 @xmath25 0.6 .",
    "this value of @xmath23/@xmath24 suggests that the bar is viewed nearer to end - on than side - on .",
    "this result contrasts with the other indicators we have , both photometric and kinematic , that suggest a more side - on orientation .",
    "the @xmath26 indicator advocated by appears to be one of the more promising indicators of bar orientation .",
    "however , it must depend on the details of the disk mass distribution .",
    "some galaxies have a distinct peak in their rotation curves before declining to a flat level while others rise continuously .",
    "consequently , @xmath24 of this particular galaxy may not correspond well to that of the ab99 model .",
    "more generally , it may be an indication that we still do not have a complete understanding of the complex kinematics in ngc 2683 .      in figure 3",
    "we show the observed  sparsepak velocity field of ngc  2683 .",
    "the major and minor kinematic axes are not perpendicular and there is an -shaped twist to the minor axis .",
    "these are characteristic of velocity fields with oval distortions or bars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "similar -shaped velocity fields can be seen in observations of more face - on barred galaxies such as ngc  6300 ( _ _ i__=52@xmath1 , * ? ? ? * ) and ngc  5383 ( _ _ i__=50@xmath1 , * ? ? ? * ) . as in the long - slit spectrum ,",
    "double and triple - valued  velocities ( as well as [ ] and [ ]  velocities ) are detected in some of the ifu fibers .",
    "the multi - valued velocities are more striking in the long - slit spectrum than in the velocity field .",
    "analysis of the velocity field with the tilted - ring fitting program ` rotcur ` @xcite shows that the position angle ( pa ) varies by @xmath7 25@xmath1 across the velocity field , with the largest deviation from the pa of the outer galaxy occuring at @xmath7 45@xmath0 , the length of the _ x@xmath20 _ parallelogram in the long - slit pvd ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "if we assume that there should be a steep velocity gradient ( i.e. the isovelocity contours bunch up ) across the bar and that the central minor axis velocity contours run along the length of the bar , then the center of the velocity field qualitatively indicates ( visually ) that the bar is angled not far ( perhaps @xmath7 15@xmath1 ) from the galaxy major axis on the sky , running from northeast to southwest .",
    "this is supported by the change in pa determined by ` rotcur ` ; the bar is a maximum of 25@xmath1 from the major axis .",
    "this angle implies that the bar is viewed more side - on than end - on , in agreement with the constraints from the parallelogram in the long - slit pvd produced by _",
    "x@xmath20 _ orbits .    in figure 5",
    "we show the  image of ngc  2683 constructed from the ifu data with isovelocity contours from the velocity field overplotted .",
    "we find that while there is diffuse emission throughout the galaxy , the brightest concentrations of emission coincide with the bends in the -shape ( the ends of the bar ) .",
    "the ne ( upper ) end of the bar is slightly brighter than the sw ( lower ) end and there is no strong emission along the length of the bar .",
    "strong  emission at the bar ends and relatively weak emission along its length has also been seen in the relatively face - on galaxies ngc  1530 @xcite , ngc  5383 @xcite , and ngc  6300 and ngc  1433 @xcite .",
    "similar to what is seen in ngc  2683 , @xcite found that the brightest  emission in ngc  1530 coincides with the regions of lowest velocity gradient perpendicular to the bar ( regions were the isovelocity contours are not bunched up ) .",

    "two of us ( rkd and ssm ) made independent ellipse fits with different fitting routines ( ` ellipse ` in iraf and archangel @xcite ) . while these ellipse fits are broadly consistent , they give slightly different results for the boxiness / pointiness parameter @xmath27 .",
    "thorough examination of the images and residuals of the fits shows that this can be traced to isophotes that are both boxy and pointy .",
    "this is most apparent in the @xmath28 and @xmath29-band images in figure 6 . along the minor axis of the bulge ,",
    "the isophotes are flatter than a pure ellipse , indicating a boxy bulge . along the major axis ,",
    "the isophotes become pointy , so that the entire isophote shape is both pointy and boxy .",
    "we interpret the pointiness to be due to the bar itself extending out into the disk ; see figures 7 and 8 .",

    "because ngc  2683 is so highly inclined , it is difficult to determine if these structures are also present .",

    "we find that the surface brightness profiles are asymmetric around the minor axis .",
    "specifically , in the slices above the major axis ( the northwest slices ) , there is a `` hump '' in the profile indicating excess light to the left ( north ) of the galaxy minor axis and in the slices below the major axis ( the southeast slices ) , the ehancement in the light is to the right ( south ) of the galaxy minor axis .",
    "we interpret this asymmetry in the light profiles as an indication that the bar is aligned in a n - s direction , consistent with the orientation derived from the sparsepak velocity field .",
    "consistent with the approximate lengths of the boxy and pointy isophote regions , the excess light begins around @xmath18 20@xmath0@xmath3125@xmath0 , peaks around 45@xmath0 , and drops off between 50@xmath0 and 60@xmath0 .",
    "based on the photometry , we estimate the length of the bar to be @xmath7 55@xmath0 .    in figure 8 , we confirm this n - s orientation by plotting surface brightness profiles along slits oriented at different position angles .",

    "the observed hi  pvd of m31 ( their figure 9 ) is more bow tie - shaped than the long - slit  pvd of ngc  2683 .",
    "as discussed in @xmath24.1 , in edge - on galaxies , the pvd appears more bow tie - like as the bar angles farther away from the major axis .",
    "taken at face value , the observed pvds would therefore suggest that the bar in m31 is seen more end - on than the bar in ngc  2683 .",
    "the simulations described in @xmath24.1 , however , are _ ideal _ and in reality , the observed kinematics are highly influenced by physical conditions in the galaxy , such as the presence of dust or the density of the gas . without further modeling , we can not say whether the differences in the pvds originate from these physical differences or from different bar orientations or some combination of both .",
    "the isophotes seen in the images of m31 ( their figure 2 ) are similar to the isophotes of the @xmath29-band image of ngc  2683 ; the isophotes are boxy rather than pinched in a peanut shape . based on isophote shapes in @xmath37-body simulations tailored to the orientation of m31",
    ", they argue that the absence of peanut - shaped isophotes means the bar is not a strong bar ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by this standard",
    ", the bar in ngc  2683 is not strong .",
    "similar to ngc  2683 , m31 has elongated isophotes that are angled away from the major axis and indicate the pa of the bar .",
    "additionally , they find similar asymmetric enhancements in the light profile in slits parallel to the major axis ( their figures 5 and 6 ) .",
    "it is encouraging that there are so many similarities between the observations of these two galaxies .",
    "bars in nearly edge - on galaxies can not be unambiguously visually confirmed as such , but strong evidence for their presence comes from the comparison of observed kinematic and photometric signatures to the results of numerical simulations",
    ". that simulations are consistent with numerous observed galaxies increases our confidence in using bars to explain boxy / ps bulges and figure - of - eight pvds .",
    "we have presented new spectroscopic and photometric observations of the near edge - on spiral galaxy ngc  2683 .",
    "the long - slit pvd displays a complex , figure - of - eight distribution of velocities , and the sparsepak ifu velocity field shows characteristics of an oval distortion .",
    "isophotes in optical and near - ir images of the galaxy are boxy .",
    "we find an asymmetric enhancement in the light profile in slits placed parallel to , and offset from , the major axis .",
    "we argue that the kinematic and photometric signatures are evidence that the galaxy hosts a bar .",
    "we find that the data support a bar that is viewed closer to side - on than end - on ( i.e. closer to the galaxy major axis than the minor axis ) .",
    "based on kinematic and photometric constraints , we determine that the bar is 6@xmath1 away from the major axis on the sky .",
    "our results are consistent with previous observations of ngc  2683 in the literature , as well as recent results for m31 , and add to the growing body of evidence linking b / ps bulges and complex pvds with bars in edge - on galaxies .",
