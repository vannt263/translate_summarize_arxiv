    "the cytoskeleton @xcite is a dense multicomponent meshwork of semiflexible polymers which interact sterically as well as through active @xcite processes . while the blending of polymers industrially requires special effort , the active environment of the living cell provides a setting in which polymers which differ substantially in their stiffness are naturally mixed and interact .",
    "moreover , active processes such as polymerization and the working of molecular motors lead to the generation of stresses without the external imposition of flow fields .",
    "these two mechanisms combine to yield a rich range of novel physical phenomena .",
    "the role of activity in cytoskeletal mechanics is receiving increasing attention , as seen from many recent theoretical and experimental studies of the rheology of cells and cell extracts @xcite .",
    "it is clear in particular @xcite that interactions between different species of filaments are crucial for cell motility , cell division , vesicular transport and organelle positioning and integrity .",
    "axis , are described by small transverse fluctuations @xmath1 .",
    "the active medium can either be contractile or tensile .",
    "the orientation of f - actin along the microtubule can either be parallel or normal to it.,width=283 ]    in this paper , we make a study of the effect of these interactions by modeling the dynamics of a stiff filament , which we will call a `` microtubule '' , immersed in an active medium ( fig.[fig1 ] ) with orientational degrees of freedom , which we will call `` f - actin '' .",
    "we emphasize here that the names `` microtubule '' and `` f - actin '' are introduced for convenience : we consider both contractile and tensile activity , although only the former applies to actomyosin .",
    "our treatment applies more generally to semiflexible polymers under tension in a wide variety of active media .",
    "we describe the medium by the active generalization of liquid - crystal hydrodynamics @xcite . for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "an active medium is one whose constituent particles possess the ability to extract energy from an ambient nutrient bath and dissipate it , executing some kind of systematic motion in the process .",
    "this endows each such particle with a permanent uniaxial stress .",
    "the other central ingredient of this work is _ anchoring _ , on which we now elaborate . in general , the interfacial energy of a liquid - crystalline medium at a wall depends on the relative orientation @xmath2 of the molecules of the medium and the normal @xmath3 to the wall . in the simplest cases , it is lowest for @xmath2 parallel , or perpendicular , to @xmath3 .",
    "this interaction is known as anchoring . in the present work , anchoring enters through the favoured orientation of the f - actin when confronted with the surface of the microtubule .",
    "we believe that steric or pair - potential effects should lead to the anchoring of the f - actin normal or parallel to the microtubule .",
    "the interplay of the types of anchoring and activity  contractile or tensile  are fundamental to our theory .",
    "the filament in our study can be viewed as a _ spatially extended _ probe of the active medium , generalizing the microrheometry of @xcite by simultaneous access to a wide range of scales .",
    "we make contact with earlier work on oscillatory filaments @xcite , and test our results against observations on microtubules in a background of contractile actin in neuronal growth cones ( see fig.[fig2 ] )",
    ".    here are our main results : ( i ) in the absence of activity , the microtubule will _ always _ buckle at large anchoring strength , regardless of the type of anchoring .",
    "( ii ) an active medium , by contrast , can stiffen _ or _ buckle the filament , depending on the relative signs of activity and anchoring .",
    "a contractile active medium with parallel anchoring always _ stiffens _ the filament , as does a tensile active medium with normal anchoring , while a contractile ( tensile ) medium with normal ( parallel ) anchoring produces buckling if the strength @xmath4 of the active stresses is large enough ( see fig.[fig3 ] )",
    ". when the nematic correlation length of the f - actin medium is large compared to the linear dimension @xmath5 of the sample transverse to the microtubule , the buckling wavelength decreases with @xmath5 as @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively in two and three dimensions .",
    "( iii ) our observations of the conformations of microtubules in the growth cone of neurons are in qualitative accord with these predictions .",
    "( iv ) activity leads to a breakdown of the fluctuation - dissipation relation : most dramatically , in the regime of strong stiffening , we predict that the effective dissipation turns negative when the frequency crosses a threshold .",
    "this is consistent with the observations of @xcite on auditory hair cells and @xcite on axons , and suggests that a negative force - velocity relation at finite frequency should be a generic feature of actively stiffening systems .",
    "indeed , the phenomenological model of @xcite emerges as a limiting case of our fundamental theory .",
    "consider a stiff , locally inextensible filament of total contour length @xmath5 , coinciding on average with the @xmath8 axis ( fig.[fig1 ] ) , with unit tangent vector @xmath9 where @xmath1 are small transverse fluctuations , and @xmath10 , immersed in a @xmath11-dimensional active medium characterized by @xmath12 , a symmetric traceless nematic order parameter @xcite .",

    "note that eq.[ueqn ] generalises @xcite to include anchoring and hydrodynamic flow . in eq.[qeqn ] , we ignore flow - orientation coupling terms @xcite .. ]    for thin - film samples at large f - actin concentration , as in the case of the lamellipodium of adhering cells , it is appropriate to treat the hydrodynamic velocity field in a local - friction approximation .",
    "we therefore write @xmath28 , with @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the cytoplasmic viscosity , and the screening length @xcite @xmath31 is no larger than the film thickness .",
    "we ignore pressure gradients on the assumption that the film thickness adjusts to accommodate these . the crucial piece of the stress @xmath32 is the active contribution @xmath33 @xcite , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively correspond to contractile and tensile stresses , and @xmath36 is the mean f - actin concentration . to leading order in gradients and linear order in filament undulations , the velocity transverse to the microtubule is [ veqn ] _ ( x,,t)=-(wc_0/)_x_x(x,,t ) .",

    "since @xmath46 in @xmath47d and @xmath48 in @xmath49d , we obtain the dispersion relations for @xmath50 for the case of an unbounded medium : -i=\\ {    cl -q_x^2 + o(q_x^4 ) , & d=3 + -q_x^2 + o(q_x^4 ) , & d=2 .[disprel ]    .",
    "the case of a confined medium is discussed towards the end of the paper .",

    "this implies a buckling instability of the filament as the anchoring strength is increased , regardless of whether the anchoring is parallel or perpendicular .",
    "this is consistent with observations @xcite of buckling of filaments in isotropic solutions of _ fd _ virus ( see their fig .",
    "when activity @xmath4 is switched on , the signs of @xmath55 and @xmath56 become independent .",
    "for large enough @xmath57 , @xmath58 for contractile ( @xmath59 ) activity and @xmath60 for tensile ( @xmath61 ) activity , while @xmath56 is separately controlled by the nature of the anchoring ( fig.[fig3 ] ) .    defining the correlation length @xmath62 of the f - actin medium",
    ", we focus on two limiting cases : ( i ) deep in the isotropic phase ; ( ii ) close to the transition to a nematic phase . in ( i ) ,",
    "@xmath63 , so eq.[disprel ] holds with @xmath64 for small @xmath65 .",
    "thus , for a filament in a strongly active medium , contractile ( tensile ) activity with parallel ( normal ) anchoring ( @xmath66 ) leads to enhanced tension , i.e. , stiffening . on the other hand , for strong contractile ( tensile ) activity with normal ( parallel ) anchoring ( @xmath67 )",
    "the filament becomes unstable to buckling .",
    "this is explained graphically in ( fig.[fig3 ] ) .        in ( ii ) , @xmath68 ( which should be accessible in f - actin , see @xcite ) so that a wide range of modes of @xmath12 contribute in eq.[qeqnft ] . in dimension @xmath693 ,",
    "eq.[disprel ] applies with @xmath70 , so that the dispersion relation differs from case ( i ) only by a logarithmic factor . in @xmath71 , however , solving the resulting cubic equation we find -i= y(||/4)^2/3(/k)^1/3q_x^4/3 [ disprelin ] where @xmath72 for @xmath73 and @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "thus , in @xmath49d , close to the ordering transition of the f - actin , while stability is determined by the sign of @xmath76 as before , the stable stiffening case @xmath73 , which can arise only for an active system , shows a damped _",
    "oscillatory _ response , which should appear as dispersive propagating waves on the filament , with speed @xmath77 . in the unstable case",
    ", the buckling wavelength can be found by comparing the negative tension and bending elasticity terms .",
    "for an f - actin medium of finite lateral extent @xmath5 , scaling arguments applied to eqs.[disprel],[disprelin ] lead to a buckling wavelength varying as @xmath6 ( @xmath71 ) and @xmath7 ( @xmath78 ) as claimed earlier in the paper .",
    "the ideas presented above are best tested in a model system in which both parallel and normal alignment of f - actin on microtubules are naturally realised .",
    "the growth cones of neurons provide a convenient system for this purpose , and allow a demonstration of activity - induced stiffening as well as buckling .",
    "our observations on this system are qualitative but in clear accord with the predictions of this paper . as seen in fig.[fig2 ] microtubules are strongly buckled in the wide central region known as the lamellipodium and show a stabilized straight shape in the spiky protrusions called the filopodia .",
    "as we have remarked , purely equilibrium effects in most systems generally lead to buckling .",
    "it seems , however , that the dynamic activity within the lamella may contribute to microtubule stiffening in the periphery , as well as buckling in the central region .",
    "we suggest the following mechanism : when the growing microtubule enters the lamellipodium , it meets the actomyosin network , with actin filaments pointing in a variety of directions .",
    "the typical encounter will have a substantial angle between microtubule and actin filament .",
    "the analysis above would then predict that the microtubule should buckle , as it does . upon entering a filopodial region",
    ", the microtubule meets actin aligned parallel to it and is stiffened , which again is consistent with our mechanism .",
    "however , whether the relevant activity is entirely non - specific and based on contractility , or whether specialized proteins are involved remains an open question . in another relevant study , brangwynne _",
    "et al_. @xcite observed significant bending fluctuations of microtubules in reconstituted actomyosin networks ( see fig.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "since the actomyosin is contractile , our theory would predict that the contacts between actin and microtubule are at near - normal alignment , and we look forward to independent tests of this . indeed , our work provides a theoretical justification for the pointlike normal force that @xcite suggest is responsible for the buckling .",
    "if @xmath79 is the displacement of a degree of freedom of a system at time @xmath80 in response to an impulsive force at time @xmath81 , and @xmath82 is the time - correlation of spontaneous fluctuations in that degree of freedom , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) @xcite , which applies to systems _ at thermal equilibrium _ , says @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath85 is the temperature .",
    "this profound and universal connection can be understood in the familiar context of a particle undergoing brownian motion in a fluid , where both the damping of an initially imposed velocity and the random motion of the particle when no velocity is imposed arise from the same microscopic collisions with molecules . for equilibrium systems , this allows one to obtain transport quantities such as conductivity without drawing a current . in systems far from equilibrium , but where the bath producing the fluctuations is still thermal , a judicious definition of variables @xcite can resurrect the fdt . for more general nonequilibrium systems too , a comparison of correlation and response can sometimes offer a useful notion @xcite of an effective temperature . our model system shows radical departures from such benign behaviour .",
    "we restrict attention to parameter ranges where there is no instability , so a steady state exists .",
    "let @xmath86 be the correlation function and @xmath87 the imaginary part of the response to an external force @xmath88 coupled to @xmath13 via a term @xmath89 in the free - energy functional @xmath90 in eq.[ueqn ] .",
    "the departure from unity of the fluctuation - dissipation ( fd ) ratio @xmath91 is a quantitative measure of nonequilibrium behaviour .",
    "we find not only that @xmath92 depends on its arguments but that it can turn negative for the stable stiffening case @xmath73 .",
    "the calculation , from eqs.[ueqnft],[qeqnft ] , is straightforward .",
    "we find [ respimag ] ( q_x,)= , where @xmath93 and @xmath94^{\\!-\\!1}$]are strictly positive and even in @xmath65 , and the fd ratio r_q_x = n_1 k_bt .",
    "[ noneqfdt ]    at thermal equilibrium ( @xmath95 ) @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 , so that @xmath100 .",
    "hence , the second term in the bracket in eq.[noneqfdt ] vanishes and the fluctuation - dissipation ratio becomes unity as expected . with activity the ratio becomes a strong function of frequency and wavenumber , through the quantity @xmath101 . in the stiffening case @xmath102 ,",
    "if the strength @xmath4 of activity is large enough , as @xmath65 crosses a threshold which depends on @xmath103 and @xmath4 , we see from eqs.[respimag],[noneqfdt ] , @xmath104 can pass through zero , and hence @xmath105 can diverge .",
    "past this threshold , both turn negative .",
    "thus one obtains a giant or even a negative fd ratio as a result of suppressed dissipation rather than enhanced noise .",
    "the fd ratio eq.[noneqfdt ] is sometimes referred to @xcite as the ratio of an `` effective temperature '' @xmath106 to the thermodynamic temperature @xmath85 , and a negative @xmath106 in this sense has been observed in experiments on hair cells @xcite .",
    "our theory eqs.[ueqn]-[veqn ] , rooted in the active - hydrodynamic approach of @xcite , provides a fundamental basis for the model presented in @xcite and suggests that the phenomenon of negative dissipation should be widely observed in active systems . to apply our treatment directly to axons @xcite and hair cells @xcite",
    ", we consider a filament confined to a tube of radius @xmath5 in the @xmath107 directions and unbounded along @xmath8 , and assume the correlation length @xmath62 of the active medium is of order @xmath5 .",
    "the integrals over @xmath108 in eq.[qeqnft ] are replaced by sums dominated by a single mode with wavenumber of order @xmath109 .",
    "this yields an effective equation of motion [ ueqnsinglemode ] ( -i+q_x^2+q_x^4 ) = -q_x^2k1 1 - i l^2 k + q_x^2l^2 plus noise . for strong active",
    "stiffening , @xmath110 large and positive , this leads to oscillatory modes with @xmath111 .",
    "these correspond to the hair cell oscillations of @xcite , generalized to allow a continuum of modes labelled by @xmath103 .",
    "we have presented a general theory for a single , long semiflexible filament interacting with an active medium .",
    "the medium consists of orientable elements , endowed with built - in uniaxial stresses whose axes are correlated with those of their neighbours .",
    "the model thus describes , in particular , a single microtubule interacting with an actively contractile actomyosin environment , but has broader applicability .",
    "whereas the various components of the cytoskeleton are usually investigated separately , our paper lays the physical groundwork for a treatment of the interaction of these different elements , in particular the contractile actin , and microtubules as active transport highways .",
    "this is essential to an understanding of cell motility and active ribosomal transport .",
    "the key ingredients of the model are anchoring  the preferred orientation imposed on the filaments of the medium when confronted with the surface of the long filament  and the contractile or tensile activity of the medium .",
    "we find that the interplay between anchoring and activity radically affects the filament s dynamics , leading to a range of possible behaviours including active stiffening , negative dissipation , oscillations , and buckling .",
    "our theory also applies to the dynamics of axons and auditory hair cells , and provides an important link between existing phenomenological models for these systems and the general framework of active matter .",
    "our experiments on the shapes of microtubules in the growth cone of a neuron show both stiffening and buckling , in broad accord with our theory .",
