    "i calculate the excitation energies of the band heads of the @xmath145 and @xmath146 bands in @xmath78ru = @xmath74mo @xmath2 @xmath0  and @xmath13mo = @xmath14zr @xmath2 @xmath0 . using eq .",

    "this finding is in reasonable agreement with earlier estimates for @xmath13mo @xcite .    in principle , the calculation of transition strengths from eq .",
    "( [ eq : be ] ) is straightforward .",
    "however , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : be ] , the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ eq : be ] ) consists of the product of two oscillating wave functions .",
    "thus , the integrand also oscillates , and the integral depends sensitively on the zeroes of the wave functions , i.e.  the radial location of the nodes .",

    "( [ eq : be ] ) may cancel each other . for @xmath150 , @xmath132 transitions the dominating contribution comes from the nuclear surface ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : be ] ) , and the calculated @xmath131 value is not extremely sensitive to the nodes of the wave functions and does not depend very sensitively on the underlying potential .",
    "in general , the calculated @xmath131 values do not deviate by more than a factor of two from the experimental values ( see table [ tab : be ] ) .",
    "this must be considered as a quite satisfactory result because the nuclear structure of @xmath151 nuclei is much more complex than the simple @xmath0-cluster description . on the other hand",
    ", the reasonable agreement between calculated and experimental @xmath131 values confirms that @xmath0-clustering is still an important feature for intermediate mass nuclei which has already been pointed out earlier ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "there is one striking deviation between calculated and experimental @xmath131 values in table [ tab : be ] : the strength of the @xmath150 transition from the @xmath117 isomer at @xmath152kev to the @xmath116 state at @xmath153kev in @xmath19cd is overestimated by a factor of more than 500 .",

    "the assignment of each lower state to the ground state band in @xcite seems to be at least questionable because of the extremely low transition strength from the @xmath117 isomer to the @xmath116 state at @xmath153kev . a larger strength of @xmath157w.u",
    ".  has been found for the transition from the @xmath117 isomer to the @xmath116 state at @xmath158kev .",
    "unfortunately , no transition strength is known for the decay of the second @xmath117 state at @xmath159kev which decays only to the lower @xmath116 state at @xmath153kev . summarizing the above",
    ", a clear band assignment is not possible for @xmath19cd .",
    "also mixing may occur between states with the same quantum number @xmath160 .",
    "further evidence for inconsistencies in the band assignment and/or mixing can be read from fig .",
    "[ fig : lamc ] .",
    "here one finds relatively large @xmath121 values for @xmath161 and @xmath162 ; contrary , the @xmath121 values for @xmath163 and @xmath164 are relatively small .    the present study is restricted to semi - magic @xmath70 even - even nuclei .",
    "an extension to semi - magic @xmath70 even - odd nuclei is complicated by the additional spin @xmath165 of the even - odd @xmath70 core which couples to the angular momentum @xmath67 of the @xmath0-particle and leads to multiplets of @xmath0-cluster states . a first attempt for @xmath28nb = @xmath29y @xmath2 @xmath0  has been made together with a study of the @xmath29y(@xmath0,@xmath0)@xmath29y scattering cross section @xcite . here",

    "whereas @xmath173 is found in @xcite , a recent experiment @xcite has found strong evidence for @xmath174 and measured a transition strength of @xmath175w.u .  for the transition to the @xmath136 , @xmath176 @xmath0-cluster state at @xmath177kev .",
    "these experimental data @xcite confirm that the state at @xmath178kev is the @xmath179 , @xmath174 @xmath0-cluster state in @xmath28nb = @xmath29y @xmath2 @xmath0 .",

    "i have increased the radius parameter of the density of @xmath74mo strongly by 10% . because the other ingredients of the folding procedure , i.e.the @xmath0-particle density and the interaction , remain unaffected , the root - mean - square radius of the potential changes by only about 5% . although the absolute values of the potential strength change ( standard potential : @xmath81 and @xmath181 for the @xmath77 and @xmath100 states in @xmath78ru ; increased radius potential : @xmath182 and @xmath183 ) , the variation @xmath121 of the potential strength in eq .",

    "fig : lamc ] and [ fig : cz ] ) . the calculated @xmath92 value for the @xmath132 transition in @xmath78ru increases by about 20% using the potential with the larger radius .",
    "these relatively small changes of the results indicate that the simplistic scaling of the radius parameter in the density parametrization can be used for extrapolations to unstable nuclei with reasonable accuracy .",

    "a significant deviation for @xmath19cd may be the result of an inconsistent band assignment in @xcite and/or mixing .",
