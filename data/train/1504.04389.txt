    "the stability of particle motion in circular accelerators has always been a topic of heated discussion in the accelerator community .",
    "in fact , the problem of localized magnet non - linearities distributed around the accelerator has invoked its own field of nonlinear dynamics studies .",
    "the most complex consequences of these non - linearities are detuning with amplitude , excitation of resonances , chaotic motion and eventually particle loss  @xcite .",
    "the theory of resonances was developed by hagedorn / schoch  @xcite in the 1950 s and modified for cern accelerator school classes by guignard in the 1970 s  @xcite .",
    "this theory treats the condition under which the motion of a particle is resonant .",
    "the treatment of motion is 2d , and the theory shows that the resonant phenomena can be described by a `` resonant driving term '' , which is a quantity that takes into account the distribution of the multipolar errors along the ring and characterizes the resonance stop - band .",
    "the interplay of the stability domain and resonances is a very difficult subject and there seems to be no general theory that explains it completely .",
    "however , simulations show that in the proximity to a resonance the regime with stable motion typically shrinks , and the phase space fragments into regions with very different dynamical properties : from stable motion , to unstable , and chaotic motion  @xcite .",
    "the difficulty of the dynamics in the vicinity of a resonance is remarkable even in regimes in which the motion do not exhibit chaoticity .",
    "concepts as fix - points easily understandable in a 2d phase space assume quite challenging aspects when the effect of resonances is considered in the 4d phase space . for regular motion in 4d phase space , the fix - points",
    "become exotic objects that we call `` fix - lines '' @xcite .",
    "the structures created by the 2 degree of freedom resonances have been subject of studies , which addressed the problem from the mapping approach @xcite .",
    "fix - lines become particularly relevant when the nonlinear dynamics is affected by space charge in bunched beams .",
    "the phenomena of periodic resonance crossing induced by synchrotron motion and space charge , create new and more complex dynamics which is very significant for present projects like the sis100 of the fair project where bunches are stored for a long term in presence of significant space charge  @xcite , or for the liu project at cern , where psb , ps and sps are upgraded in intensity and the same topology of high intensity problem is encountered  @xcite . for 1d resonances the interplay of space charge with fix - points has been extensively studied , numerically and experimentally  @xcite . on the other hand , studies on the interplay of space charge and 2d resonances has never be attempted because of the remarkable difficulty in characterizing stable resonances in 4d phase space ( the fix - lines ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the fix - lines in the proximity of a coupled third order resonance and find the relation of these objects with the stability properties of motion .",
    "hence we extend the theory as presented by guignard @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : in sect .",
    "ii we give an overview of the 2d resonances : this phenomenological analysis categorizes the resonances and discusses the main features of 1d and 2d resonances .",
    "the concept of fix - line is introduced and examples are shown . in sect .",
    "iii the phenomenology of the third order coupled resonances is being outlined .",
    "fix - lines and tori cut are discussed using proper cuts in two dimensional planes .",
    "section iv describes the theory of particle motion in a constant focusing channel equipped with one sextupole , the theory is developed following a perturbative approach .",
    "section v deals with the problem of removing the time dependence from the hamiltonian .",
    "we find that there are infinite canonical transformations able to remove the time dependence .",
    "this finding extends the theory of schoch , and in fact it directly leads to a theory of the fix - lines ( sect .",
    "section vii treats the issue of the stability of the motion around a fix - line , and presents exact formulas for the case of a single resonant term .",
    "the analysis of stability allows to derive the secondary tunes of the motion around the fix - lines . in sect .",
    "viii we discuss the stability of motion in the vicinity of the third order coupled resonance , and find with large generality a complete characterization of the stability of motion for the case of the dynamics dominated by one single resonant term . tests and comparison with tracking simulations",
    "are shown as well .    in sect .",
    "ix we extend the analysis to an ag structure equipped with many thin sextupoles .",
    "following the corresponding arguments used for the constant focusing lattice , we directly retrieve a description of the dynamics in the proximity of a third order coupled resonance in terms of the resonance driving term as obtained from the theory of schoch ( for an arbitrary distribution of perturbative sextupolar errors ) .",
    "the comparison with multi - particle simulations is addressed as well .",
    "lastly , in section x we show that our theory allows to explain the results of the tori cut presented in sect .",
    "section xi is devoted to the conclusions and sect .",
    "xii holds the acknowledgments . in the appendix a ( sect .",
    "xiii ) we discuss the perturbed solutions around the fix - lines , and in the appendix b ( sect .",
    "xiv ) we elaborate in more details on mathematical aspects of the discussion in sect .",
    "resonance structures in 1d of freedom have been studied in depth and will not be mentioned except for a schematic comparison with the 2d case .    in 2 degrees of freedom",
    "we have basically 3 different types of resonances . in fig .  [ fig1:fig_1 ]",
    "we find an example of a vertical 1d resonance addressed with `` 1 '' . in the vertical plane",
    "you do expect to see a resonance structure with distinct resonance islands , whilst in the horizontal plane the motion is non resonant .",
    "therefore we will expect to find a number of resonances vertical islands that may be widened due to deformations in the horizontal plane .",
    "we will not follow this type of resonance any further since it is basically very similar to the classical and well - known 1d resonances .    at the heart of this paper are the coupled resonance of type `` 2 '' in fig .",
    "[ fig1:fig_1 ] .",
    "the theoretical understanding of such coupled resonances including detuning with amplitude will be addressed in the following chapters . here",
    "we want to show how they affect the motion in phase space .",
    "a peculiar type of resonance is depicted with `` 3 '' in fig .",
    "[ fig1:fig_1 ] .",
    "this is the 2d analogon of 1d fix - points , i.e. these fix - points are equivalent to the central fix - point at the origin of the 2d closed orbit if it is different from zero in any of the 4 coordinates . to some extent",
    "the motion in the vicinity of fix - points is better defined then close to a fix - line structure .",
    "the authors envisage a separate report just dedicated to those 2d fix - points .",
    "0.9 mm    ( 80,65 ) ( -5 , 0 )      figure  [ fig1:fig_2 ] shows schematically how the 2d phase space looks for a stabilized resonance , i.e. the detuning with amplitude creates island instead of unbounded motion along hyperbolic lines to infinity .",
    "it is important to mention that the phase space in the plane of the resonance for the type `` 1 '' resonance in fig .",
    "[ fig1:fig_1 ] would look quite similar except that one will experience a widening of the projection of island motion that in the 1d schematic depiction is a measureless thin line around the fix - point .",
    "this classical island structure in 1d has mostly regular motion in the inner part at small amplitude to the central closed - orbit , which is the green area in the fig .",
    "[ fig1:fig_2 ] . for completeness one has to mention that careful inspection of the motion in that `` green '' area will reveal other fine island structures .",
    "besides the regular motion around stable 1d fix - points , depicted as the red area in fig .",
    "[ fig1:fig_2 ] one finds deterministic chaotic motion in the vicinity of the unstable fix - points and the separatrix which separates the island motion from the `` green '' area at lower amplitude . at larger amplitude outside the island structure ( for simplicity",
    "not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1:fig_2 ] ) one would expect regular motion up to a limit where motion becomes unbounded .",
    "this limit is called the dynamic aperture .",
    "notice that there is a dashed circular line that connects the fix - points which is denoted by `` undisturbed '' kam torus . by",
    "that we mean the undisturbed motion in absence of the non - linearities of the system .    0.9 mm    ( 80,70 ) ( -2 , 0 )",
    "the last argument is a good link to resonances in 4d phase space , the real emphasis of this work . in 2 degrees of freedom",
    "the phase space is four dimensional .",
    "however , the motion of each individual particle is restricted to a two - dimensional manifold . in passing , we like to stress that the restriction to these two - dimensional manifolds is the very reason why there is a fundamental difference between motion in 2d and 4d phase space respectively : in the case of 1 degree of freedom each regular particle motions is on a curved line that separates phase space into an inside and outside part so that no particle can cross - over from one part to the other . however ,",
    "in 2 degrees of freedom particles move on two - dimensional manifolds that can not separate the 4d phase space into a inside and outside part since that would require a three - dimensional manifold . in consequence",
    "this means that in 4d phase space all chaotic regions are linked through - out phase space such that there is no longer a strict concept of the dynamic aperture in systems larger than 1 degree of freedom .",
    "while particle motion in 2d phase space is pretty much self - evident one needs some preparation to finds one s way in 4d phase space . to this end",
    "it is helpful to look at a 3d projection of linear and uncoupled motion in the 4d phase space . in fig .",
    "[ fig1:fig_3 ] the motion in phase space of @xmath0 is shown while @xmath1 is still hidden .",
    "part a ) shows @xmath0 at some angle around the @xmath2 axis : it becomes evident that the motion is on a torus .",
    "when looking straight from the horizontal viewpoint ( @xmath3 in part b ) one finds a perfect ellipse without any thickness and for mixed coordinates ( @xmath4 in part c ) one finds a rectangular shape .",
    "it goes without saying that the ( @xmath5 ) phase space is also an ellipse and that for all mixed coordinates one finds a rectangular shape .",
    "it is important to realize that we are still lacking the @xmath6 coordinate @xmath1 . a good way to describe",
    "this extra dimension is to understand that the particle moves on a double layered torus , i.e. two - dimensional manifolds in 4d .",
    "introducing non - linearities tends to separate the layers of the torus so that very complex structures will be found in phase space .",
    "this becomes evident in fig .",
    "[ fig1:fig_4 ] which shows a case with strong non - linearities switched on : large amplitudes have been chosen but the motion remains regular and refined to a two - dimensional manifold .",
    "the rotation angle of part a ) is chosen to make the double layer structure strikingly visible .",
    "traditionally , there have been attempts to use other means e.g. a color code to allow for a full grasp of the dynamics in 4d .",
    "set aside spectacular aesthetic pictures effectively this did little to substantially enhance our understanding of those dynamics .",
    "what really counts is that one can use cuts in phase space that take away overlapping pieces of the 2d manifold in the phase space projections .",
    "schematically one can have a look at how the `` undisturbed '' 2d kam torus in case of linear motion is broken up into a fix - line structures as shown in fig .  [ fig1:fig_5 ] .",
    "one finds that of this torus we are left with a set of alternating stable and unstable fix - lines : in the vicinity of the stable fix - lines the particles move on tori around the fix - line ( again a 2d manifold ) , while the motion at the unstable fix - lines and the limiting `` separatrix torus '' is of chaotic nature .    the comparison of fig .  [ fig1:fig_2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig1:fig_5 ] shows how island structures in 2d are a generalization of those in 1d , albeit in 4d we have additional complexity .",
    "a more complete analogon to the 1d case is to be expected around 2d fix - points as shown below .    in case of a fix - line",
    "there is one condition fixed between the tunes therefore the stable 2d manifolds break up into 1d objects . in case",
    "there is a second condition fulfilled between the tunes these fix - lines are further broken up so that only fix - points , stable or unstable , remain . in fig .",
    "[ fig1:fig_6 ] it is schematically shown how the particle motion evolves around stable fix - points .",
    "in fact , one expects structures that resemble the motion around the central fix - point around the closed - orbit , i.e. regular motion in small distance to the fix - point and the set - in of chaos at larger amplitudes . in the figure",

[ fig1:fig_8 ] part c ) ): one can nicely find regular motion close to the fix - point and fuzzy , i.e. chaotic motion at larger amplitude .",
    "it has to be mentioned that this holds true in all 3d projections , albeit without a visual demonstration shown here .      in the analysis of motion in the vicinity of resonances",
