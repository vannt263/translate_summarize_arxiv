    "due to the rich variety of their physical properties , 2d materials are attracting much attention .",
    "huge thermal conductivity values ( @xmath1 ) in graphene @xcite and in boron nitride @xcite , various electronic properties in transition metal dichalcogenides @xcite , high - t@xmath2 superconductivity in cuprates @xcite are among some of the specific properties of interest .",
    "about two - thirds of the mx@xmath0 transition metal dichalcogenides @xcite crystallize in layered structures and they exhibit a wide range of tunable electronic states ( semiconducting , insulating , semi - metallic and superconducting ) , as well as exotic optical and mechanical properties .",
    "their crystals can be easily cleaved as successive x layers are only weakly bonded by van der waals forces .",
    "the well - known sulfides derived from tis@xmath0 have recently been under active investigation in the new context of thermoelectric materials research @xcite .",
    "while the thermoelectric power factor , @xmath3 , ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the electrical resistivity and seebeck coefficient , respectively ) of tis@xmath0 single crystals is similar to that of bi@xmath6te@xmath7 , the thermoelectric material most commonly used in applications , the thermal conductivity ( @xmath8 ) exhibits relatively high values@xcite : @xmath9 , compared to @xmath10 for bi@xmath6te@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this reduces the dimensionless figure of merit , @xmath11 , which measures the theoretical efficiency of energy conversion .",
    "several attempts have been made to reduce @xmath8 in dense ceramics , for example via intercalation in the van der waals gap as in cu@xmath12tis@xmath0 , or substitution at either anion or cation sites as in tis@xmath13se@xmath14 or ta@xmath15ti@xmath16s@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "these investigations have lead to zt values of 0.4 at 650k .",
    "however , for all these ceramic series , it is difficult to distinguish whether changes in @xmath8 are a result of changes in the charge carrier concentration , the concentration of substituted or intercalated ions , or grain boundary effects .",
    "moreover , the chemical formula should more properly be written as non - stoichiometric ti@xmath17s@xmath0 .",
    "it is known to be a degenerate extrinsic semiconductor with extra ti@xmath18 cations in the van der waals gap , the donated electrons of which populate the empty ti d - band of the tis@xmath0 layer @xcite . meanwhile",
    ", the crystallographic texturation of ceramic samples implies that the transport properties always result from a convolution of in - plane and out - of - plane contributions , not to mention scattering by grain boundaries .    in this article",
    ", we report on in - plane electronic and thermal transport for several metallic single crystals derived from tis@xmath0 .",
    "the changes in @xmath8 ( in - plane ) are dominated by the lattice part with a peak at @xmath19/5 ( @xmath19=debye temperature ) expected for phonon - dominated heat transport .",
    "we show that reduction in the lattice heat transport ( @xmath20 ) deriving from the substitution or intercalation of foreign cations accounts for the majority of the change in @xmath8 , and we identify the species that are most effective at reducing the thermal conductivity .",
    "the @xmath20(300k ) values obtained for crystals derived from tis@xmath0 can be reduced by a factor of around five , from @xmath21 ( for the most stoichiometric crystals @xcite ) to @xmath10 ( this study ) .",
    "we conclude that the thermoelectric properties of the 2d dichalcogenides could be improved by thermal conductivity engineering , even before nanostructuring is pursued .",
    "large platelet - like crystals were grown by a vapour transport technique using iodine as the transport agent @xcite .",
    "intercalated and chemically substituted single crystals were grown by pre - reacting co and ta with tis@xmath0 precursor at 500@xmath22c prior to the growth phase .",
    "shiny thin crystals were obtained for all the different batches and powder x - ray diffraction confirmed the presence of the tis@xmath0 phase . scanning electron microscopy with",

    "electrical resistivity and hall effect was measured using a standard six probe technique .",
    "thermal conductivity and seebeck coefficient were measured on single crystals using a custom built steady - state experiment installed in a physical properties measurement system cryostat .",
    "calibrated heat pipes were used to measure the thermal power entering and leaving the sample @xcite . power loss ( principally from radiation )",
    "did not exceed 30% at 300k .",
    "this contributes to an additional uncertainty in the thermal conductivity measurements of approximately 10% at 300k , which becomes negligible below 150k .",
    "one crystal of tis@xmath0 was also measured using the harman technique @xcite and the results are in good agreement .",
    "electrical resistivity of the samples is shown in fig .  [ fig : tep]a .",
    "they show metallic - like behavior with @xmath27 in between 0.6 and 1@xmath28 and resistivity ratio @xmath29 related to residual resistivity values at 5k of 0.2 to 0.3@xmath28 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the curves follows the previously seen @xmath30 with @xmath31 behaviour over a wide temperature range ( 60 - 300k ) that has been ascribed to the approximately equal contributions of inter- and intra - valley scattering to the relaxation time @xcite .",
    "values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 are shown in table  [ tab : params ] and the fits are included in fig .",
    "[ fig : tep]a .    a key problem with tis@xmath0 and derivatives is controlling the charge carrier concentration , which arises both from deliberate substitution or intercalation , and from the tendency for excess ti@xmath18 to self - intercalate in the van der waals gap . in the following ,",
    "we establish the concentration of substituted and/or intercalated cations , @xmath34 , by reference to well - characterised ceramic series using the c - axis lattice parameters @xcite , and obtain the corresponding charge carrier concentration , @xmath35 , from hall effect measurements .    in the case of the tis@xmath0 single crystal , @xmath36 gives@xcite @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "these values are consistent with a stoichiometry close to ti@xmath39s@xmath0 , assuming that all of the excess ti@xmath18 is intercalated and that all four electrons become free carriers .",
    "the ceramic sample of the same nominal stoichiometry presents nearly identical seebeck coefficient , which we consider to be a more reliable measure of the doping level in ceramic materials than @xmath35 , as was shown in the cuprate superconductors @xcite . the value of @xmath40 for the single crystals of ref",
    ".   corresponds to between 1 and 1.5% excess titanitum according to the same ceramic series@xcite .",
    "the co@xmath24tis@xmath0 crystal has @xmath41 and a correspondingly larger @xmath42 .",
    "previous studies of co intercalation at high concentrations were consistent with the co@xmath43 oxidation state @xcite .",
    "@xmath44 implies a stoichiometry close to the nominal co@xmath24 composition@xcite , and shows the contraction of the lattice characteristic of the strong covalent nature of bonding between the co@xmath43 ion and the sulphur atoms in adjacent layers@xcite .",
    "by contrast , the presence of intercalated ti@xmath18 tends to enlarge the van der waals gap .",
    "the measured @xmath35 therefore corresponds to @xmath45 and a stoichiometry co@xmath46 ; this is certainly within the margin of error afforded by the lattice parameter measurements .",
    "there is no suggestion of significant ti self - intercalation in this case , and we speculate that the contraction of the lattice leads to a much lower ability of ti@xmath18 to enter van der waals gap .",
    "the highly doped ta@xmath47ti@xmath48s@xmath0 has a much smaller @xmath49 and a correspondingly larger @xmath50 .",
    "ta substitution at the ti site provides one free carrier per ion , as can be seen from the linear dependence of @xmath35 on doping in ref .  .",
    "the value of @xmath51 is close to that obtained for a ceramic sample of the same nominal ta@xmath47 composition @xcite , as is @xmath52 . given this composition , only @xmath53 charge carriers are expected .",
    "we conclude that the rest of the carriers arise from excess ti intercalation , such that the composition is approximately ta@xmath47ti@xmath54s@xmath0 , giving @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the nominal and derived chemical formulae for all of the single crystals are summarised in table  [ tab : params ] .      .",
    "the red circles and yellow diamonds represent the steady state and harman measurements on nominally stoichimetric tis@xmath0 respectively ( see text ) . the electronic contribution estimated from the wiedemann - franz law ( solid lines )",
    "is subtracted to give the lattice thermal conductivity * b)*. the peak height of @xmath20 at @xmath57k is reduced as impurity scattering increases .",
    "the fits to the debye - callaway model ( black solid lines ) are dominated by the variation in this parameter .",
    "the estimated minimum lattice thermal conductivity is also shown.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    the in - plane thermal conductivity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa]a ) , particularly the lattice contribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa]b ) , is a powerful probe of @xmath34 , especially in the absence of grain boundaries .",
    "the only previously reported thermal conductivity value for a slightly self - intercalated tis@xmath0 crystal@xcite was @xmath9 , with @xmath58 corresponding to @xmath59 . for the latter ,",
    "the electronic part of @xmath8 was only @xmath60 against @xmath61 for the present tis@xmath0 and co@xmath24tis@xmath0 crystals ( assuming that the wiedemann - franz law is valid in this regime for electronic heat transport ) .",
    "generally speaking , the thermal conductivity curves follow the typical form expected for heat transported mainly by phonons : a large quasi - linear rise at low temperature as phonons are excited , a peak limited by cation and defect concentration , followed by a continuing decrease at higher temperatures as phonon - phonon umklapp scattering processes become dominant .",
    "we extract the lattice thermal conductivity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa]b ) by subtracting the electrical contribution to the total thermal conductivity according to the wiedemann - franz law , @xmath62 , where we use the sommerfeld value of the lorenz number @xmath63@xmath64 .",
    "@xmath65 extracted in this way is usually an upper bound since a ) inelastic scattering processes , maximally active at @xmath66 , scatter the thermal but not the electrical current effectively and b ) if the temperature broadening of the fermi distribution approaches the bandwidth , scattering processes are no longer quasi - elastic .",
    "for the high carrier concentrations in the samples measured here , the fermi temperature is in excess of 1000k and our measurements remain in the quasi - elastic regime @xcite .",
    "we analyse @xmath20 using the debye - callaway model with contributions from boundary , impurity , umklapp and planar defect scattering : @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath70@xmath71 is the in - plane sound velocity @xcite and @xmath72 mm is the relevant limit for boundary scattering , corresponding to the average sample dimension .",
    "@xmath73 is the prefactor for scattering by point - like defects ( lattice imperfections or foreign cations ) , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the parameters describing the umklapp processes , and @xmath76 is related to the density of planar defects .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath76 significantly improves the quality of the fits at low temperature .",
    "the impurity , defect and boundary scattering control the shape of the curve at low temperatures , while umklapp scattering controls the decline at high temperatures .",
    "@xmath77k is used for all samples@xcite . in the case of the ceramic sample ,",
    "we use @xmath78 nm in order to compare to the results of ref .  .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the ceramic sample shows a smaller @xmath73 than the single crystal of tis@xmath0 , but also a much lower @xmath20 .",
    "the primary reason for the difference between these two cases is the parameter @xmath79 , which describes scattering by grain boundaries . if we take the identical parameters as for the single crystal , a value of @xmath80 nm produces a very similar @xmath20 to the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa]b , showing that this is indeed the dominant scattering mechanism .",
    "the reduction in thermal conductivity on going from crystal to ceramic is almost perfectly balanced by the increase in resistivity , however , leading to no change in @xmath81 at 300k .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown using well calibrated concentrations of substituted or intercalated ions in single crystal materials that the most effective species at reducing the thermal conductivity in the tis@xmath0 system is ta@xmath18 substitution at the ti site .",
    "ta substitution is particularly suitable as it provides only 1 electron per ion , compared to 2 and 4 for co and ti intercalants , introducing more scattering centers for a given charge carrier concentration .",
    "the thermoelectric performance of ta doped materials so far studied has however been limited by parasitic self - intercalation of ti .",
    "improvements in thermoelectric performance will only be realised once this effect can be controlled",
    ". then studies of ceramic tis@xmath0 and derivatives for potential applications can be pursued , as similar performance can be obtained even in the presence of grain boundaries .",
