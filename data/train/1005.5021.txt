    "a hedge fund is a lightly - regulated private investment vehicle that may utilise a wide range of investment strategies and instruments .",
    "these funds may use short positions , derivatives , leverage and charge incentive - based fees . normally , they are structured as limited partnerships or offshore investment companies .",
    "hedge funds pursue positive returns in all markets and hence are described as `` absolute return '' strategies .",
    "hedge funds are utilised by pension funds , high net - worth individuals and institutions , due to their low correlation to traditional long - only investment strategies .",
    "the incentive - based performance fees , earned by hedge fund managers , align the interest of the hedge fund manager with that of the investor .",
    "the performance of hedge funds has been impressive , with the various hedge fund indices providing higher returns , with lower volatility , than traditional assets over many years . as of the end of the first quarter 2006",
    "the total assets managed by hedge funds world wide is estimated at $ 1.25 trillion @xcite .",
    "hedge funds generally only report their returns on a monthly basis and this means that there is a very limited amount of data available to study as databases of hedge fund returns have only been in operation for about 15 years .",
    "this is in keeping with the highly secretive , proprietary nature of hedge fund investing .",
    "the amount of information reported by a hedge fund about how and where it is producing its returns is often limited to sectoral overviews and strategy allocations . for an introduction to hedge funds see @xcite .",
    "significant diversification benefits can be gained by investing in a variety of hedge fund strategies , due to the presence of low and even negative correlations between different hedge fund strategies .",
    "such strategies can be broken up into two general categories : directional and market neutral .",
    "directional strategies , ( for example long / short equity , emerging markets , macro and managed futures ) have a high risk , high return profile and act as return enhancers to a traditional portfolio .",
    "market neutral strategies , ( for example convertible arbitrage , equity market neutral and fixed income arbitrage ) deploy a low risk profile and act as a substitute for some proportion of the fixed income holdings in an investors portfolio , @xcite .",
    "a fund of hedge funds allows investors to have access to a large diverse portfolio of hedge funds without having to carry out due diligence on each individual manager .",
    "the diversification benefits provided by fund of funds are brought about by investing in a number of funds that have a low correlation to each other .",
    "these correlations are often calculated by using equally weighted fund returns and can contain a significant amount of noise due to the very small amount of returns data available for hedge funds @xcite .",
    "in this paper we apply random matrix theory to hedge fund returns data with the aim of reducing the levels of noise in these correlation matrices formed from this data and hence constructing a fund of hedge funds with an improved risk profile .",
    "previous studies have used the information found in the rmt defined deviating eigenvalues of a correlation matrix as inputs into a minimum spanning tree @xcite to enable characterisation of hedge fund strategies . in this paper the components of the deviating eigenvectors are shown to correspond to distinct groups of strategies that are applied by hedge fund managers and this is exploited to construct a portfolio with reduced levels of risk .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section 2 we review rmt and discuss its use in the extraction of information from a correlation matrix of hedge fund returns using rmt techniques . in section 3",
    "we look at the results obtained applying random matrix theory to hedge funds and , in the final section , we draw our conclusions .",
    "given returns @xmath0 , @xmath1 , of a collection of hedge funds we define a normalised return in order to standardise the different fund volatilities .",
    "we normalise @xmath2 with respect to its standard deviation @xmath3 as follows : @xmath4 where @xmath3 is the standard deviation of @xmath2 for assets @xmath1 and @xmath5 is the time average of @xmath2 over the period studied .",
    "then the equal time cross correlation matrix is expressed in terms of @xmath6 @xmath7 the elements of @xmath8 are limited to the domain @xmath9 , where @xmath10 defines perfect correlation between funds , @xmath11 corresponds to perfect anti - correlation and @xmath12 corresponds to uncorrelated funds . in matrix notation , the correlation matrix can be expressed as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an @xmath15 matrix with elements @xmath16 .",
    "the spectral properties of @xmath17 may be compared to those of a `` random '' wishart correlation matrix @xcite , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an @xmath15 matrix with each element random with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "statistical properties of random matrices have been known for many years in the physics literature @xcite and have been applied to financial problems relatively recently @xcite .    in particular , the limiting property for the sample size @xmath20 and sample length @xmath21 , providing that @xmath22 is fixed , has been examined to show analytically that the distribution of eigenvalues @xmath23 of the random correlation matrix @xmath24 is given by : @xmath25 for @xmath23 within the region @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the variance of the elements of @xmath14 ; ( for @xmath14 normalised this is equal to unity ) .",
    "@xmath31 are the bounds of the theoretical eigenvalue distribution .",
    "eigenvalues that are outside this region are said to deviate from random matrix theory .",
    "hence by comparing the empirical distribution of the eigenvalues of the funds correlation matrix to the distribution for a random matrix as given in equation  [ theo_evalue_dist ] , we can identify the deviating eigenvalues .",
    "these deviating eigenvalues are said to contain information about the system under consideration and we use eigenvector analysis to identify specifically the information present .      the deviations of @xmath32 from the rmt result @xmath33 implies that these deviations should also be displayed in the statistics of the corresponding eigenvector components @xcite . in order to interpret the meaning of the deviating eigenvectors ,",
    "we note that the largest eigenvalue is of an order of magnitude larger than the others , which constrains the remaining @xmath34 eigenvalues since @xmath35 = n$ ] .",
    "thus , in order to analyse the contents of the remaining eigenvectors , we first remove the effect of the largest eigenvalue . to do this we use the linear regression ( as discussed in @xcite ) @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the number of funds in our sample . here",
    "@xmath39 corresponds to the components of the largest eigenvector .",
    "we then recalculate the correlation matrix c using the residuals @xmath40 .",
    "if we quantify the variance of the part not explained by the largest eigenvalue as @xmath41 , @xcite , we can use this value to recalculate our values of @xmath31 .    using techniques for sector identification , @xcite",
    ", we try to analyse the information contained in the eigenvectors .",
    "we partition the funds into groups @xmath42 as defined by the managers strategy ( eg .",
    "equity long / short , managed futures .",
    "see appendix a for a complete strategy breakdown for the sample ) .",
    "we define a projection matrix @xmath43 , if fund @xmath44 belongs to group @xmath45 and @xmath46 otherwise . for each deviating eigenvector @xmath47",
    "we compute the contribution @xmath48^{2}$ ] of each strategy group , where this represents the product of the projection matrix and the square of the eigenvector components .",
    "this allows us to measure the contribution of the different hedge fund strategies to each of the eigenvectors .",
    "as suggested in @xcite , we also aim to assess how the effects of randomness lessen as we move further from the rmt upper boundary boundary , @xmath28 .",
    "to do this we use the inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) .",
    "the ipr allows quantification of the number of components that participate significantly in each eigenvector and tells us more about the level and nature of deviation from rmt .",
    "the ipr of the eigenvector @xmath47 is given by @xmath49 and allows us to compute the inverse of the number of eigenvector components that contribute significantly to each eigenvector .",
    "the diversification of an investment into independently fluctuating assets reduces its risk .",
    "however , since cross - correlations between asset prices exist , the accurate calculation of the cross - correlation matrix is vitally important .",
    "the return on a portfolio with @xmath50 assets is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the return on asset @xmath44 , @xmath53 is the fraction of wealth invested in asset @xmath44 and @xmath54 .",
    "the risk of holding this portfolio is then given by @xmath55 where @xmath3 is the volatility of @xmath2 and @xmath8 are the elements of the cross - correlation matrix . in order to find an optimal portfolio , using the markowitz theory of portfolio optimisation @xcite , we minimise @xmath56 under the constraint that the return on the portfolio , @xmath57 , is some fixed value .",
    "this minimisation can be implemented by using two lagrange multipliers , which leads to a set of @xmath50 linear equations which can be solved for @xmath53 .",
    "if we minimise @xmath58 for a number of different values of @xmath57 , then we can obtain a region bounded by an upward - sloping curve , called the _",
    "efficient frontier_.    in the case of optimisation with a portfolio containing only hedge funds , the additional constraint of no short - selling is natural due to the difficulties in short - selling of funds ; ( note that short - selling may be achievable by the use of swaps but is uncommon ) @xcite .    in order to demonstrate the effects of randomness on the cross - correlation matrix of hedge funds we first divide the time series studied into two equal parts .",
    "we assume that we have _ perfect knowledge _ on the future average returns @xmath59 by taking the observed returns on the second sub - period .",
    "we calculate    1 .",
    "the predicted efficient frontier using the correlation matrix for the first sub - period and the expected returns @xmath59 2 .   the realised efficient frontier using the correlation matrix for the second sub - period and the expected returns @xmath59 .",
    "the portfolio risk due to the noise in the correlation matrix can then be calculated using @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the risk of the realised portfolio and @xmath62 is the risk of the predicted portfolio .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that correlations may also be measured in the random part of the eigenvalue spectrum . however , since our aim here is to demonstrate how random matrix theory can be used to improve the risk / return profile for a portfolio of hedge funds , we assume that the eigenvalues corresponding to the noise band in rmt , @xmath63 , are not expected to correspond to real information following @xcite .",
    "we then use this assumption to remove some of the noise from the correlation matrix .",
    "although the technique used in @xcite has been shown to lead to problems with the _ stability _ of the correlation matrix @xcite , we apply it here as a simple test case to demonstrate how noise can be removed from the cross - correlation matrix formed from hedge fund returns .",
    "this technique involves separating the noisy and non - noisy eigenvalues and keeping the non - noisy eigenvalues the same .",
    "the noisy eigenvalues are then replaced by their average and the correlation matrix is reconstructed from the cleaned eigenvalues .",
    "we can then compare the risk of both the predicted and realised portfolios for the original and cleaned correlation matrices .",
    "the dataset studied here is a collection of 49 hedge funds with varying strategies over a synchronous period from january 1997 to september 2005 @xmath64 .",
    "the original dataset was much larger ( approximately 1500 funds ) but since the length of data available was much less than the number of funds we were forced to choose a subset .",
    "the subset chosen were the 49 funds with the longest track records giving us a fund to data ratio @xmath65 .",
    "reducing the dataset in this way is not unrealistic as a typical fund of hedge funds would monitor a subset of funds and choose a portfolio from these @xcite .",
    "often one of the criteria used in choosing this subset of investable funds would be the completion of a minimum track record .",
    "other data sets , such as a portfolio made up of hedge fund strategy indices , were also studied by the authors with notably similar results .",
    "first we calculated the empirical correlation matrix between the funds using equally weighted returns and from this found the spectrum of eigenvalues .",
    "this is then compared with the theoretical spectrum for random wishart matrices ( as per equation  [ theo_evalue_dist ] ) , using @xmath66 and @xmath67 . as can be seen from figure  [ evalue_dist ] ,",
    "the bulk of the eigenvalues conform to those of the random matrix .",
    "there are three deviating eigenvalues , at @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "this means that @xmath71 of eigenvalues deviate from the rmt prediction which is consistent with the findings of @xcite , where the authors argue that at most @xmath72 of eigenvalues are non - noisy .          in order to show that there was no dependence on the choice of time period or the length of the series we broke the time series up into two segments and again compared the eigenvalue spectrum of the correlation matrix with that of a random wishart matrix . for both time periods",
    "studied we found just two eigenvalues that deviated from the rmt prediction . as can be seen in figure  [ bootstrapped_results ] ,",
    "the anomalous eigenvalue contributions are very similar for both periods chosen , which implies independence from the choice of time period and stationarity of the data .",
    "the values of the deviating eigenvalues are shown in table 1 .",
