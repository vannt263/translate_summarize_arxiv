    "multi - pixel silicon - based avalanche photo - diodes operated in geiger mode ( sipm ) have become increasingly popular in hep , as well as medical and astroparticle physics applications .",
    "what makes them attractive alternatives to the more conventional photomultiplier tubes ( pmt ) is for instance the insensitivity to magnetic fields and in some cases the higher photon detection efficiency , the compactness and robustness , and the low cost . with respect to avalanche",
    "photo - diodes ( apd ) sipms offer a high intrinsic gain ( 10@xmath0 - 10@xmath1 ) which significantly simplifies the readout electronics , and increases the response stability to voltage or temperature changes .",
    "sipms are also insensitive to ionizing radiation , i.e. the nuclear counter effect .",
    "additionally , sipms provide fast timing ( @xmath2100ps fwhm for a single photon ) and single photon counting capabilities .",
    "in this paper i review the products available on the market in terms of their basic properties and i discuss how each property influences or limits the design of typical hep detectors . + the zoo of names referring to multi - pixel geiger - mode avalanche photo - diodes ( sipm , g - apd , sspm , mrs apd , ampd , mppc , etc . )",
    "is only partially representative of the increasing variety in performance between the various products .",
    "we shall see what the key parameters are to characterize a sipm and how the various products are comparing on the basis of these parameters .",
    "good sipms by themselves do not make up for a whole hep detector .",
    "therefore , it is important to review the current status of sipm specific readout chips as well as the implications of sipms on the design of a multi - channel detector .",
    "issues like the need of individual sipm bias adjustment and of the calibration and monitoring system are addressed .",
    "the equivalent electric circuit of a sipm is the parallel sum of as many diodes as the sipm has individual pixels , typically 100 - 2000mm@xmath3 . to all diodes a common inverse bias voltage",
    "is provided to operate the device a few volts above the breakdown point , @xmath4 .",
    "each diode requires an active quenching of the geiger discharge , normally obtained by connecting a resistor in series with the diode .",
    "the time needed for a pixel to become active again after a discharge is known as the pixel recovery time , @xmath5 .",
    "this is the product of the pixel quenching resistor , r@xmath6 , and the pixel capacitance , c@xmath7 .",
    "the value of r@xmath6 has to be larger than 100  k@xmath8 to be able to quench the avalanche and can be as large as 20  m@xmath8 in some cases  @xcite .",
    "the value of c@xmath7 scales with the pixel area and can be 20 - 150  ff . thereby , @xmath5 can range between a few 10  ns to a few @xmath9s .",
    "it has to be kept in mind that polysilicon resistors are temperature dependent , and so is the pixel recovery time .",
    "alternative quenching methods are being tested as well like integrated fet circuits in the silicon wafer  @xcite or cmos quenching circuits in the case of digital sipms  @xcite .      the sipm gain , m is defined as the number of electric charges generated by one geiger discharge in a sipm pixel .",
    "this value is quite stable for geiger discharges , and can be around 10@xmath0 - 10@xmath1 .",
    "this is why a sipm single pixel signal can be seen directly on the oscilloscope without preamplification as a signal of a few mv on a load of 50  @xmath8 .",
    "the pixel recovery time affects the design of the readout electronics as the integration or shaping time needed to exploit the large sipm gain depends on the length of the signal . the effective sipm gain , m@xmath10 is the number of electric charges measured in a given time interval after the geiger discharge of one pixel , m@xmath11 m. when",
    "reading the sipm signal through a small decoupling capacitor or with a short shaping time , it is sometimes necessary to use a preamplification factor of 10 - 50 .",

    "secondary avalanches , the so called after - pulses , can follow a primary one caused by the release of carriers trapped in the silicon crystal during the primary geiger avalanche .",
    "the first contribution is temperature dependent and approximately doubles for an increase of eight degrees .",
    "the second one depends on the pixel recovery time , the shorter @xmath5 is ( 20% for hamamatsu mppcs  @xcite with @xmath14 30  ns , 3% for cpta / photonique  @xcite with @xmath15 150  ns ,  @xcite ) the larger is the contribution from after - pulse",
    ". it also increases exponentially with the over - voltage-10@xmath1  hz .",
    "as shown ( figure  [ fig : dr ] ) in a characterization study reported in  @xcite , the dark rate depends exponentially on the voltage above breakdown at which the device is operated ( higher dark rate for higher over - voltage , or @xmath16 . for simplicity i will use this abbreviation in this paper . ] ) and on the pixel capacitance ( higher dark rate for larger capacitance at the same over - voltage ) .",
    "in addition , the dark rate is strongly influenced by the quality of the silicon wafer used for the sipm production and by the level of cleanliness during the implant processes .",

    "if these photons reach a neighboring pixel an additional avalanche can be caused .",
    "this effect is known as optical crosstalk between pixels and can occur as often as 30 - 40% of the times a geiger discharge takes place . the optical crosstalk increases exponentially with the sipm gain .",
    "this is the combined effect of two factors : the number of photons generated in the discharge increases with the number of carriers , and the avalange trigger efficiency increases with increasing over - voltage .",
    "photons traveling directly between pixels can be stopped by optical tranches in the silicon .",
    "this technique introduced first by cpta / photonique  @xcite , and later on used by sensl  @xcite and stmicroelectronics  @xcite , reduces significantly the optical crosstalk to @xmath191 - 3% .",
    "the remaining effect is due to absorbed photons in the silicon bulk , much below the optical tranch , which are later re - emitted at an angle that allows them to reach a neighboring pixel .",
    "this last effect can hardly be avoided . a comparison study from  @xcite of crosstalk of various devices",
    "is reported in figure  [ fig : ct ] .",

    "@xmath20 is strongly non - linear , and ignoring recovery time effects it saturates to the total number of pixels in a device for very large number of impinging photons .",
    "the photon detection efficiency can be factorized in three components : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the wavelength - dependent quantum efficiency of a pixel , @xmath23 is the geometric fill factor of the sipm , and @xmath24 is the wavelength- , voltage- and temperature - dependent probability for a photoelectron to trigger a breakdown , or geiger discharge .",

    "the chips in the `` roc '' family are designed to operate with pulsed power supply for minimized heat dissipation .",
    "the foreseen power consumption amounts to 25@xmath9w per channel for the final ilc operation .",
    "silicon photomultipliers are a novel , yet well established technology for detection of visible photons .",
    "they are a very promising alternative to standard photo - multiplier tubes in many applications in high energy physics and also in medical fields .",
    "their small size makes them suitable for the direct single - channel readout of highly segmented detectors , like for example calorimeters , fiber tracking detectors and positron emission tomography detectors .",
    "though the application of sipms is rapidly growing and extending to always new designs the mass production capability of these photo - detectors is still not fully proportionate to the request .",
    "the physics community recognizes the need of more competitive products commercially available in large quantities and with a minimum spread of the key parameters like operation voltage , gain , dark rate , crosstalk , photo - detection efficiency , etc ..    for a detector operating a large number of sipm a monitoring system is often mandatory .",
    "two possible designs are discussed in which light from an led is used to monitor the sipm gain and response , and possibly the saturation point of the sipm non - linear response function .    to fully exploit the advantages of sipms as photo - detectors ,",
    "newly developed multi - channel readout chips are required .",
    "available chips for sipm readout are presented and theirs differences and advantages are discussed . to accommodate the large variety of existing sipms",
    "the ideal readout chip should offer single - channel adjustable voltage , preamplifier gain and/or zero suppression threshold .",
