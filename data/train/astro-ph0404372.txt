    "optical imaging of low redshift ( z @xmath2 0.5 ) bl lac objects ( e.g. falomo & kotilainen 1999 ; urry et al .",
    "2000 ) has shown that virtually all of them are hosted in luminous ellipticals , with characteristics indistinguishable from those of inactive massive ellipticals . on the other hand , near - infrared ( nir )",
    "imaging has only been available for small samples of bl lacs ( kotilainen et al . 1998 [ k98 ] ; scarpa et al .",
    "2000 [ s00 ] ; cheung et al .",
    "2003 [ c03 ] ) .",
    "we present deep high spatial resolution ( @xmath30.7 arcsec fwhm ) nir @xmath1band ( 1.65 @xmath4 m ) imaging of 23 low redshift ( z @xmath2 0.3 ) bl lacs that were previously investigated in the optical @xmath0-band ( references above ) .",
    "we combine them with previous data to form a sample of 41 bl lacs with which to investigate the optical - nir colour properties of the bl lac hosts and to compare them with radio galaxies ( rg ) and inactive ellipticals .",
    "full report is given in kotilainen & falomo ( 2004 ) .",
    "it is well known that the colours of elliptical galaxies become bluer towards fainter magnitudes ( e.g. kodama & arimoto 1997 ) .",
    "this colour  magnitude ( c - m ) relation may depend on age and metallicity .",
    "[ hrh ] ( left panel ) shows the optical - nir c - m relation of the bl lac hosts , compared with ellipticals in clusters ( bower et al .",
    "bl lac hosts exhibit a much broader range of colours , and they are systematically bluer than inactive ellipticals .",
    "this behaviour is similar to that found for low redshift rgs ( govoni et al .",
    "2000 ) and quasar hosts ( jahnke et al .",
    "2004 ) . this trend could be explained if the c - m relation for ellipticals breaks down at the highest luminosities .",
    "indeed , the bl lac hosts cover the bright end of the luminosity function of ellipticals . however , although very few of the ellipticals are equally luminous , those few exhibit red colours . therefore , if the c - m relation of ellipticals extends to high luminosity , the obvious explanation for the blue colours is recent star formation ( sf ) .",
    "the broad range of colours then reflects differences in the sf epoch , from most recent sf episodes ( blue ) to old stellar populations ( red ) .",
    "inactive ellipticals have negative colour gradients ( bluer with increasing radius ) due to age and metallicity gradients ( e.g. tamura et al .",
    "the bl lac hosts ( and rgs ; govoni et al .",
    "2000 ) show on average also a negative colour gradient ( fig .",
    "[ hrh ] , right panel ) , which is steeper and has a wider spread than that exhibited by inactive ellipticals ( peletier et al .",
    "1990 ; schombert et al .",
    "intriguingly , we find a significant tail in the distribution with very strong negative gradients . these could be either intrinsic or due to central dust extinction in the host galaxies .",
    "significant amount of dust in rgs has indeed been detected as dust lanes or dusty disks ( capetti et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "if the blue colours are caused by a young stellar population component , they may signify the link between the interaction / merging event that triggered nuclear activity and rejuvenated the stellar population .",
    "however , optical and nir images of bl lac hosts show few obvious signs of interaction ( e.g. tidal tails , asymmetries ) .",
    "this may necessitate a significant time delay ( @xmath5 100 myr ) between the sf episodes and the onset of the nuclear activity .",
