    "a locally compact quantum group is a pair @xmath1 of a @xmath2-algebra @xmath3 and a comultiplication @xmath4 on @xmath3 , satisfying certain properties .",
    "if @xmath3 is an abelian @xmath2-algebra , it then has the form @xmath5 , the @xmath2-algebra of all continuous complex functions , tending to  @xmath6 at infinity on a locally compact group @xmath7 and the comultiplication @xmath4 is given by the formula @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the product in @xmath7 of the elements @xmath11 .",
    "observe that in this case , @xmath12 is a bounded continuous complex function on @xmath13 that in general , will not belong to @xmath14 . indeed , also in the general case , the comultiplication @xmath4 is a @xmath0-homomorphism on @xmath3 with values in @xmath15 , the multiplier algebra of the spatial @xmath2-tensor product @xmath16 of @xmath3 with itself .",
    "any locally compact group @xmath7 carries a left and a right haar measure .",
    "this is also true for a locally compact quantum group . in this case , these are ( nice ) invariant weights on the @xmath2-algebra .",
    "an important fact is that , in the quantum case , the existence of these weights is part of the axioms , whereas in the classical theory , it is possible to prove the existence of the haar measures .",
    "such existence theorems exist only in special cases for locally compact quantum groups however ( and it seems that a general existence theorem is still out of sight ) .",
    "the structure of a locally compact quantum group is very rich , but also technically difficult to work with .",
    "it requires not only the standard results on operator algebras ( like the tomita - takesaki theory ) , but also fundamental skills with weights on @xmath2-algebras , unbounded operators on hilbert spaces , @xmath17 and all of this comes on top of a highly non - trivial algebraic structure , involving a lot of objects .",
    "this makes it rather hard to work with locally compact quantum groups .",
    "moreover , the present non - trivial examples are very complicated ( although something is changing here , thanks to work done by vaynerman and vaes , see e.g.  @xcite and also @xcite ) .",
    "all of this makes it difficult , and perhaps not very attractive , to try to learn the theory and start working in it .",
    "nevertheless , all the people familiar with the theory know that the structure is very rich and that this is a nice piece of mathematics .",
    "fortunately , there are the ` algebraic quantum groups ' .",
    "these are multiplier hopf  ( @xmath0-)algebras with ( positive ) integrals ( see section  [ sec2 ] where we start by recalling this notion ) .",
    "as we mentioned already in the abstract , any multiplier hopf  @xmath0-algebra with positive integrals gives rise ( in a straightforward and easy way ) to a locally compact quantum group .",
    "however , not all locally compact quantum groups are of this form .",
    "the compact and discrete quantum groups belong to this class and some combinations of those two ( like the drinfeld double of a compact quantum group ) . the class is also self - dual . among the locally compact groups it seems to be possible to characterize those coming from a multiplier hopf algebra ( @xcite ) .",
    "such a result is not yet available for locally compact quantum groups .",
    "algebraic quantum groups are of a purely algebraic nature and it is possible to work with them without going into deep analysis .",
    "nevertheless , the structure is very rich and from the algebraic point of view , contains all features of the general locally compact quantum groups .",
    "all of the relevant data are present and essentially no extra relations are imposed by the restriction to these algebraic quantum groups . for completeness",
    ", we have to mention however that we still do nt know of examples of algebraic quantum groups where the scaling group is not leaving the integrals invariant  this is still open .",
    "on the other hand , in the non @xmath0-case , such examples are known ( and are in fact not so complicated ) , see e.g.  @xcite or @xcite .",
    "it seems fair to say that the development of the general theory of locally compact quantum groups ( by kustermans and vaes , see @xcite and @xcite ) has been possible , among other reasons , because of the work done before by kustermans and myself on algebraic quantum groups ( see @xcite ) . and",
    ", as we indicated already above , it is a common practice to verify general results about locally compact quantum groups first for algebraic quantum groups ( where only the algebraic aspects have to be considered ) .",
    "extending these results to the general case later is usually fairly complicated , but there is always a good chance that it can be done .",
    "indeed , algebraic quantum groups are _ a good model _ for general locally compact quantum groups .",
    "and there is more . not only to obtain new results , but also for understanding the old ones , it is important to get first some familiarity with the framework of algebraic quantum groups ( as probably , the authors themselves have done before obtaining their general result ; of course , not publishing this intermediate step ) .",
    "this is precisely what this note is all about : after recalling some of the basics of multiplier hopf  @xmath0-algebras with positive integrals ( in section  [ sec2 ] ) , we illustrate the above strategy in the two following sections . in section  [ sec3 ] ,",
    "we take a certain point of view , starting from a dual pair of multiplier hopf  @xmath0-algebras .",
    "the @xmath0-structure however does not play an essential role here . on the other hand , in section  [ sec4 ] ,",
    "we pass to the hilbert space level and there the @xmath0-operation and positivity of the integrals becomes essential .",
    "the key to our approach here is the fourier transform . in the general theory ,",
    "the fourier transform is not very explicit .",
    "the main reason is that the hilbert spaces , @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the classical case of an abelian locally compact group , are identified through this fourier transform in the general quantum case .",
    "this common practice has clear advantages , but it also makes some features less transparent .    in the present note , very few proofs are given . in the first part of this paper we recall some of the basic notions and known results .",
    "details can be found elsewhere and references will be given .",
    "on the other hand , many other results that we present later , are not yet found ( in this form ) in other papers and it is our intention to publish details together with j.  kustermans in @xcite .",
    "however , we must say that essentially most of the results are , in some form , already present in one of the papers @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the main difference is the explicit use of the fourier transform .",
    "recall that after all , this paper is meant to serve mainly as a tool for learning and understanding the subject .    for the standard notions and results on hopf algebras , we refer to the basic works of abe @xcite and sweedler @xcite .",
    "for some information about dual pairs of hopf algebras , we refer to @xcite . for the theory of multiplier hopf algebras ,",
    "the reference is @xcite while algebraic quantum groups ( multiplier hopf algebras with integrals ) are studied in @xcite .",
    "dual pairs of multiplier hopf algbras are treated in @xcite and actions of multiplier hopf algebras in @xcite .",
    "a survey on the theory of multiplier hopf algebras is given in @xcite .    then ,",
    "as part of this work also takes place in hilbert spaces , we need to give some references about operator algebras also .",
    "much of this can be found in @xcite but also a good reference is @xcite .",
    "for the theory of weights and the tomita - takesaki theory , we refer to @xcite .",
    "the theory of kac algebras is to be found in @xcite .    finally , we would like to say something about conventions .",
    "the algebras we deal with are algebras over the complex numbers and may or may not have an identity . if there is no identity however , the product is assumed to be non - degenerate ( as a bilinear form ) .",
    "we are mainly interested in @xmath0-algebras .",
    "these are algebras with an involution @xmath20 satisfying the usual properties .",
    "essentially , these @xmath0-algebra structures are always of a certain type because we assume that there is a faithful positive linear functional . for the comultiplications ,",
    "we use the symbol @xmath4 .",
    "this comes from hopf algebra theory .",
    "however , this choice is not completely obvious here as the same symbol is also commonly used for the modular function of a non - unimodular locally compact group and ( related ) for the modular operator in the tomita - takesaki theory .",
    "we will use other symbols for these objects .",
    "in fact , the difficulty arises from the fact that this material is relating two completely different fields in mathematics .",
    "the first one is the theory of hopf algebras and the second one is the theory of operator algebras .",
    "different customs are usual in these two areas .",
    "since we are mainly interested in the theory of locally compact quantum groups , that is formulated in the operator algebra framework , we will follow what is common there .",
    "we will use however the sweedler notation as it is justified to do so and of course it makes many formulas and arguments much more transparent . indeed , we would like this paper also to be readable for the hopf algebra people and we hope that our third section ( where we do not emphasize on the involutive structure ) will serve as a bridge between the two areas .",

    "first , i would like to thank my colleagues ( and friends ) at the institute of mathematics in oslo , where part of this work was done , for their hospitality during my visit in november 2001 .",
    "secondly , i am grateful to the organizers of the meeting in strasbourg , in particular l.  vaynerman , for giving me the opportunity to talk about my work .",

    "we will first briefly recall the notion of a multiplier hopf  @xmath0-algebra . for details , we refer to @xcite , see also @xcite .    [ def2.1 ] a _ multiplier hopf  @xmath0-algebra _ is a pair @xmath21 of a @xmath0-algebra @xmath3 ( with a non - degenerate product ) and a comultiplication @xmath22 on @xmath3 such that the linear maps @xmath23 and @xmath24 defined on @xmath16 by @xmath25 are one - to - one and have range equal to @xmath16 .",
    "we have to give some more explanation .",
    "the @xmath0-algebra may or may not have an identity",
    ". however , the product , as a bilinear map , must be _ non - degenerate_. this is automatic if an identity  exists .",
    "for an algebra @xmath3 with a non - degenerate product , one can define the so - called _",
    "multiplier algebra_. it contains @xmath3 as an essential ideal and it has an identity .",
    "in fact , it is the largest algebra with these properties . because @xmath3 is a @xmath0-algebra , the multiplier algebra @xmath26 is also a @xmath0-algebra .",
    "the tensor product @xmath16 is again a @xmath0-algebra with a non - degenerate product and also the multiplier algebra @xmath15 can be constructed .",
    "elements of the form @xmath27 and @xmath28 exist in @xmath15 for all @xmath29 .    a _ comultiplication _ on @xmath3 is a @xmath0-homomorphism @xmath30 which is non - degenerate and coassociative . to be non - degenerate here means that @xmath31 .",
    "this property is automatic when @xmath3 has an identity  @xmath32 and when @xmath4 is unital , i.e.  @xmath33 . because of the non - degeneracy of  @xmath4 , it is possible to extend the obvious maps @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( where @xmath36 is the identity map ) on @xmath16 to maps from @xmath15 to @xmath37",
    "this is why coassociativity makes sense in the form @xmath38 .",
    "finally , the linear maps @xmath23 and @xmath24 , as defined in the definition , will be maps from @xmath16 to @xmath15 .",
    "the requirement is that they are injective , have range in @xmath16 and that all of @xmath16 is in the range of these maps .",
    "the following is the motivating example for this notion .",
    "[ ex2.5 ] let @xmath7 be a group and let @xmath3 be the algebra @xmath39 of complex functions with finite support in @xmath7 .",
    "then @xmath16 is identified with @xmath40 while @xmath15 is the algebra of all complex functions on @xmath13 .",
    "the map  @xmath4 , defined by @xmath41 whenever @xmath42 and @xmath43 , will be a comultiplication on @xmath3 .",
    "coassociativity is a consequence of the associativity of the group multiplication in @xmath7 .",
    "here is the relation with the notion of a hopf  @xmath0-algebra ( see @xcite ) .    if @xmath1 is a hopf  @xmath0-algebra , then it is a multiplier hopf  @xmath0-algebra .",
    "conversely , if @xmath1 is a multiplier hopf  @xmath0-algebra and if @xmath3 has an identity , then it is a hopf  @xmath0-algebra .",
    "* _ proof . _ * ( sketch )  i ) if @xmath1 is a hopf  @xmath0-algebra , the inverses of the maps @xmath23 and @xmath24 in definition  [ def2.1 ] are given in terms of the antipode @xmath44 : @xmath45    \\ii ) on the other hand , if @xmath1 is any multiplier hopf  @xmath0-algebra , the above formulas can be used to construct an antipode ( and a counit ) . the counit is a @xmath0-homomorphism @xmath46 such that @xmath47 and @xmath48 for all @xmath29 .",
    "the antipode is a anti - homomorphism @xmath49 satisfying @xmath50 and @xmath51 for all @xmath29 ( where @xmath52 is multiplication as a linear map from @xmath16 to @xmath3 ) .",
    "these formulas are given a meaning in @xmath26 .",
    "\\iii ) so , if @xmath1 is a multiplier hopf  @xmath0-algebra with an identity , then it is automatically a hopf  @xmath0-algebra .   + it is obvious that the antipode @xmath44 and the counit @xmath53 in the case of the example  [ ex2.5 ] are given by @xmath54 and @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the identity in the group and where @xmath57 is the inverse of @xmath58 .",
    "+ next we recall the notion of an integral on a multiplier hopf  @xmath0-algebra ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a linear functional  @xmath59 on  @xmath3 satisfying @xmath60 for all @xmath29 is called left invariant . a linear functional  @xmath61 on  @xmath3",
    "is called right invariant if @xmath62 for all @xmath29 .",
    "a non - zero left invariant functional is called a _ left integral _ while a non - zero right invariant functional is called a _",
    "right integral_.    observe that the above formulas , expressing invariance , again must be considered in @xmath26 .",
    "left invariance of @xmath59 should e.g.  be written in the form @xmath63 for all  @xmath64 .",
    "we have the following results on integrals on a multiplier hopf  @xmath0-algebra ( see  @xcite ) .    [ prop2.5 ]",
    "let @xmath1 be a multiplier hopf  @xmath0-algebra and assume that a left integral @xmath59 exists .",
    "then we have :    1 .",
    "there is also a right integral @xmath61 .",
    "2 .   the left and right integrals are unique , up to a scalar .",

    "in fact , this result is true for any regular multiplier hopf algebra ( again see  @xcite ) .    in the case of a multiplier hopf  @xmath0-algebra ,",
    "it is natural to assume that the left integral @xmath59 is positive , i.e.  that @xmath74 for all @xmath29 . in that case",
    ", we have some more consequences for the above data .",
    "it can be shown e.g.  that automatically a positive right integral exists .",
    "this is not obvious however and the only argument available now is given in @xcite .",
    "also , we have that  @xmath75 . furthermore , some very nice analytic properties can be proven about the multiplier @xmath65 and about the automorphisms @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there are many extra properties and relations among the different data that appear in proposition  [ prop2.5 ] .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a collection of them .    from now on",
    ", we will assume that @xmath1 is a multiplier hopf  @xmath0-algebra with positive integrals .",
    "we will also use the term _ ( @xmath0-)algebraic quantum group_. observe that the adjective ` _ algebraic _ ' is not referring to the concept of an algebraic group , but rather to the purely algebraic framework that one can use in the study of this type of locally compact quantum groups .",
    "we will use @xmath59 to denote a positive left integral and we use @xmath61 for a positive right integral .",
    "it is possible to give a standard relative normalization of  @xmath59 and  @xmath61 ( see e.g. @xcite ) , but we will not need it .",
    "+ we now turn our attention to _",
    "the dual_. we have the following result ( again see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath1 be a multiplier hopf  @xmath0-algebra with positive integrals .",
    "let @xmath76 be the subspace of the dual space of @xmath3 , consisting of linear functionals on @xmath3 of the form @xmath77 where @xmath59 is a left integral and @xmath29 .",
    "then @xmath76 can be made into a multiplier hopf  @xmath0-algebra and again it has positive integrals .    first observe that the elements of @xmath76 are also the ones of the form @xmath78 , @xmath79 or @xmath80 where always @xmath81 runs through @xmath3 . the product in @xmath76 is obtained by dualizing the coproduct and the involution is given by @xmath82 where  @xmath44 is the antipode .",
    "the coproduct @xmath83 on @xmath76 is dual to the product in @xmath3 .",
    "a right integral @xmath84 on @xmath3 is obtained by letting @xmath85 when @xmath86 . with this definition ,",
    "we get @xmath87 when as before @xmath88 .",
    "so indeed , @xmath84 is again positive .",
    "applying the procedure once more takes us back to the original multiplier hopf  @xmath0-algebra . for details here",
    "see  @xcite .    there are also many formulas relating the data for @xmath1 , namely @xmath53 , @xmath44 , @xmath59 , @xmath61 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath89 with the corresponding data for the dual algebra @xmath90 .",
    "see e.g.  @xcite and also @xcite .",
    "+ in the _ remaining of this paper _ , we will let @xmath91 be the dual algebra @xmath76 , but we will consider it with the _ opposite comultiplication _ @xmath92 .",
    "we will systematically use letters @xmath93 ( and sometimes @xmath94 ) to denote elements in @xmath3 and letters @xmath95 ( or @xmath96 ) for elements in @xmath91 .",
    "we will use @xmath97 for the evaluation of the element @xmath98 in the element @xmath81 . we will ( in general ) also drop the symbol @xmath99 on the objects related with @xmath91 .",
    "in other words , we will be working with a ( modified ) dual pair @xmath100 of multiplier hopf  @xmath0-algebras with positive integrals ( as introduced in @xcite ) .",
    "we call it ` _ modified _ ' because of the fact that the coproduct in  @xmath91 has been reversed ( contrary to the original definition in @xcite ) .",
    "this has e.g.  as a consequence that @xmath101 on @xmath91 and so @xmath102 for all @xmath29 and @xmath103 .",
    "also @xmath104 and @xmath105 on @xmath91 .",
    "the reason for this modification is to get the theory here in accordance with the general theory of locally compact quantum groups .",
    "a last remark for this section : we will use the sweedler notation .",
    "it is justified as long as we have the right _ coverings _ : e.g.@xmath106 is written as @xmath107 and we say that @xmath108 is covered by @xmath109 .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed discussion on the use of the sweedler notation for multiplier hopf algebras . observe that sometimes , the covering is through the pairing .",
    "the reason is that given an element @xmath98 in @xmath91 e.g.  there exists an element @xmath56 in @xmath3 such that @xmath110 for all @xmath111 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) so that the element @xmath98 will , in a sense , cover the element @xmath81 , through the pairing , by means of this element @xmath56 .",
    "as in the previous section , also here @xmath100 will be a dual pair of multiplier hopf  @xmath0-algebras with positive integrals .",
    "again we will assume that @xmath112 , and that @xmath91 is endowed with the opposite coproduct @xmath113 .",
    "we will now define an action of @xmath3 and an action of @xmath91 on @xmath3 .",

    "one can verify that these are indeed actions of @xmath3 and of @xmath91 .",
    "remark that we have used @xmath119 for an element in @xmath3 .",
    "we will do this systematically for elements in @xmath3 when we treat @xmath3 as the space on which the algebras act . we will use the letter @xmath120 for elements in @xmath91 when we have actions on the space @xmath91 .    throughout this paper ,",
    "the reader should have in mind that @xmath121 will be used for ` _ multiplication _ ' operators and that @xmath122 will be used for ` _ convolution _ ' operators .",
    "we have the following commutation rules .    [ lem3.2 ] for @xmath29 and @xmath103",
    "we have @xmath123    these relations are called the _ heisenberg commutation relations_. one can show that the linear span of the operators @xmath124 is precisely the linear span of the rank one maps on @xmath3 of the form @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "we have already considered the bijection @xmath128 from @xmath3 to @xmath91 .",
    "this is one possible _",
    "fourier transform_. we will also consider another one :    [ def3.3 ] we define two maps @xmath129 by @xmath130    observe that these maps depend on the normalization of @xmath59 and @xmath61 .",
    "they are related by a simple formula : @xmath131 is a scalar multiple of @xmath132 .",
    "the two maps can also be regarded in their dual forms .",
    "then , we get the following :    [ prop3.4 ] for all @xmath29 and @xmath103 we have @xmath133    in this case , we need the relative normalization of the left integrals on  @xmath3 and  @xmath91 together with the relative normalization of the right integrals on  @xmath3 and  @xmath91 w.r.t .  each other ( cf.@xcite and also @xcite ) .    later in this section",
    ", we will give another form of these formulas .",
    "as we mentioned already , these maps play the role of the fourier transforms .",
    "observe that @xmath134 when @xmath135 ( see further ) .",
    "this is a result that we have mentioned before already , taken into account that @xmath104 on @xmath91 . for the other transform , we have @xmath136 when @xmath137 . as we have chosen to work basically with the left integrals , we will be mainly using the fourier transform @xmath138 and we will drop the index and simply write @xmath139 for @xmath138    what happens with the actions under this fourier transform ?",
    "the fourier transform does convert the multiplication operators to convolution operators and the other way around .",
    "more precisely , we get the following :    [ prop3.5 ] for all @xmath140 and @xmath103 we have @xmath141 where @xmath142 and @xmath143 are defined on @xmath91 by @xmath144 with @xmath145 .    one can verify e.g.  that , for @xmath64 and @xmath145 , @xmath146 observe the difference with the action @xmath147 of @xmath91 on @xmath3 where the antipode was involved .",
    "this is not so here , for the action @xmath147 of @xmath3 on @xmath91 , a fact that is related with taking the opposite comultiplication on the dual ( as we can notice in the above argument ) .",
    "we have a similar set of formulas when we look at @xmath131 in stead of @xmath138 .",
    "+ now , we relate all of this with the so - called _ left regular representation_.    consider the map @xmath148 from @xmath16 to itself defined by @xmath149    this map is bijective and the inverse is given by @xmath150 ( using the sweedler notation )",
    ". we will denote @xmath151 by @xmath152 .",
    "then we get the following :    [ lem3.7 ] the map @xmath152 verifies the pentagon equation @xmath153 ( where we use the _ leg - numbering notation _ ) .",
    "this equation is to be considered , in the first place , as an equality of linear maps from @xmath154 to itself .    in the present context",
    "however , we can say more .",
    "[ prop3.8 ] we have @xmath155 and @xmath156 for all @xmath29 and @xmath103 .",

    "this action of @xmath159 is non - degenerate and therefore extends to an action of the multiplier algebra @xmath161 in a unique way ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the first statement in the above proposition says that the linear operator  @xmath152 is the action of some multiplier in @xmath161 . for the second result",
    ", we observe that we have a natural pairing of @xmath162 with @xmath163 ( coming from the pairing of @xmath3 with @xmath91 ) and that this pairing can be extended to a bilinear map pairing @xmath161 with @xmath163 .",
    "the fact that @xmath155 makes it possible to interpret certain ( well - known ) formulas in another , nicer way .",
    "one can now show that the formula @xmath164 makes sense in the algebra @xmath165 .",
    "for this we have to observe that  @xmath166 is a non - degenerate @xmath0-homomorphism from @xmath159 to @xmath167 , which is naturally imbedded in @xmath165 , and hence has a unique extension to a unital @xmath0-homomorphism from @xmath161 to @xmath165 .    the other equation , namely @xmath168 is somewhat more tricky .",
    "this equation is clear when considered as an equation of linear maps from  @xmath169 to itself .",
    "but in these circumstances , it can also be viewed as an equation in @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the algebra generated by @xmath3 and @xmath91 , taking into account the commutation relations of lemma  [ lem3.2 ] .",
    "this algebra @xmath171 is called the _ heisenberg algebra _ ( or sometimes the heisenberg double ) but , as we mentioned before , its structure only depends on the pairing of the linear spaces @xmath3 and @xmath91 . therefore we tend to think of the heisenberg algebra @xmath171 as an algebra with two special subalgebras @xmath3 and @xmath91 , sitting in the multiplier algebra @xmath172 , rather then of the algebra itself .",
    "finally , there is the equation @xmath173 this equation can be given a meaning using not only that @xmath155  but also that @xmath174 and @xmath175 are in fact elements in  @xmath159 .",
    "if e.g.  we apply @xmath176 to the first of these two elements , we get formally , because  @xmath44  is  an anti - homomorphism @xmath177 and this is then  @xmath178 .    using the fact that @xmath152 is ( in a way ) the duality , we can rewrite the first formula of proposition  [ prop3.4 ] as @xmath179 using these expressions , we have an easy way to obtain the plancherel formula . indeed , using the same notations as above ,",
    "@xmath180 we have used that @xmath152 is a unitary in the @xmath0-algebra case and so @xmath181 .",
    "the pentagon equation for @xmath152 ( lemma  [ lem3.7 ] ) is in fact equivalent with the heisenberg commutation relations ( lemma  [ lem3.2 ] ) given that @xmath152 is the duality ( cf .",
    "proposition  [ prop3.8 ] ) .",
    "the relation with the heisenberg commutation rules becomes also more apparent in the following formula .",
    "[ prop3.9 ] if we transform the map @xmath152 on @xmath16 to a map on @xmath163 using the fourier transform @xmath139 ( i.e.  @xmath138 in definition  [ def3.3 ] ) on the first leg , we get the map @xmath182    indeed , we had @xmath183 and we know from proposition  [ prop3.5 ] that @xmath184 where @xmath185 .",
    "it should be observed that the inverse of the above map is @xmath186 and that these two maps are indeed well - defined maps from @xmath163 to itself ( which is not completely obvious but follows from the previous considerations , see also @xcite ) .",
    "also remark that these two maps precisely govern the heisenberg commutation relations ( see lemma  [ lem3.2 ] ) .",
    "we finish this section by another application of the above expressions .",
    "let @xmath3 be finite - dimensional and denote by @xmath187 the trace on the algebra @xmath171 .",
    "then , for some scalar @xmath188 , we have @xmath189 for all @xmath29 .",
    "* _ proof .",
    "_ * we will show that the right hand side is left invariant and then we get the formula by uniqueness of left invariant functionals .",
    "observe that @xmath190 .",
    "so let @xmath191 .",
    "we will write @xmath192 for @xmath152 .",
    "we will also drop @xmath160 and simply write @xmath81 for @xmath114 .",
    "then we have @xmath193   + observe that we have used the trace property and also the fact that in this case @xmath194 . by composing with the antipode , we see that here the trace is also left invariant .",
    "the above argument can be used to prove the existence of integrals on hopf  @xmath0-algebras with a nice underlying @xmath0-algebra structure .",
    "in fact , the argument can be modified so that it also works for any finite - dimensional hopf algebra .",
    "in this case , one has to make one modification because possibly @xmath195 and another one because it might happen that the above functional is trivially @xmath6 .",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "in the previous section , we essentially did not use the @xmath0-structure . in this section",
    ", we will see the consequences of the positivity of the integrals .",
    "we refer to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite where more details can be found ; see also @xcite .",
    "let @xmath196 denote the hilbert space obtained by completing @xmath3 for the scalar product given by @xmath197 .",
    "denote by @xmath198 the canonical imbedding of @xmath3 in @xmath196 so that @xmath199 for all @xmath200 .",
    "similarly , we will use @xmath201 and @xmath202 for these objects for the integral @xmath59 on @xmath91 .",
    "the maps @xmath203 and @xmath204 extend to bounded linear maps on @xmath196 .",
    "we will use  @xmath114 for the first one and  @xmath115 for the second one ( in agreement with the notations used in the previous section ) .",
    "we have @xmath205 and @xmath206 whenever @xmath29 and @xmath103 .",
    "these last formulas are relatively easy to verify , using the left invariance of @xmath59 . however , the boundedness of the maps @xmath114 and @xmath115 is not so obvious",
    ". we will give an argument later .",
    "we have similar results for @xmath91 .",
    "that is , we have bounded maps @xmath143 and  @xmath142 on @xmath201 given by @xmath207 and @xmath208 whenever @xmath29 and @xmath209 . also here @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "this clarifies in a way the boundedness of the operators @xmath212 and @xmath213 , provided we know the boundedness of the operators @xmath114 and @xmath143 already , but that is more obvious .",
    "+ now , we will see what we can say about the map @xmath152 .",
    "so we have @xmath215 the unitary @xmath152 is called the _ left regular representation _ of @xmath1 .",
    "if we take any other @xmath216 , and if we define a normal linear functional @xmath217 on @xmath218 ( the algebra of all bounded linear operators on @xmath196 ) by @xmath219 , we see that @xmath220 .",
    "it is this type of formula that can be used to argue that @xmath114 is a bounded operator on @xmath196 . and similarly for @xmath115 .",
    "again , we can apply the fourier transform @xmath139 .",
    "if we only apply it on the first leg , we get a unitary map @xmath221 from @xmath222 to itself given by @xmath223 this is the hilbert space version of the map given in proposition  [ prop3.9 ] .",
    "we can look at this formula in two ways .",
    "first , the right hand side is @xmath224 this is the form we get when we start from the formula with @xmath152 and apply the fourier transform @xmath139 on the first leg in the tensor product .",
    "we can also look at the right hand side as @xmath225 and when we apply the fourier transform once more , now on the second leg , we get the operator on @xmath226 given by @xmath227 when we flip the two components in the tensor product @xmath226 , we precisely get the adjoint of the unitary operator @xmath228 defined by @xmath229 this is the left regular representation of @xmath230 .",
    "so we find the that the fourier transform carries @xmath152 into @xmath231 where @xmath232 is used here to denote the flip on  @xmath233 .",
    "+ we will come back to this operator later .",
    "now , we want to apply the tomita - takesaki theory . according to this theory",
    ", we get the following ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath234 the weak operator closure of @xmath235 and by @xmath236 the commutant of @xmath234 .",
    "there exists a positive , self - adjoint , non - singular operator @xmath237 and a unitary , conjugate linear involution @xmath238 on @xmath196 such that @xmath239 and @xmath240 for all @xmath117 .",
    "the space @xmath241 is a core for the domain of @xmath242 .",
    "we also have that @xmath243 and @xmath244 for all @xmath245 .",
    "the maps @xmath246 , defined by @xmath247 are called the _ modular automorphisms_.",
    "one can show that @xmath114 for @xmath29 is analytic for this one - parameter group of automorphisms and that @xmath248 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "do not confuse the automorphism @xmath68 on @xmath3 with the one - parameter group of automorphisms @xmath249 on @xmath234 .",
    "similarly , we have operators @xmath250 and @xmath251 on @xmath201 satisfying @xmath252 whenever @xmath145 .",
    "they have the same properties w.r.t .  the von neumann algebra @xmath253 , obtained by taking the weak closure of @xmath254 on @xmath201 .",
    "+ let us now consider a very _ special functional _ on the heisenberg algebra @xmath171 , introduced in the previous section .",
    "for a treatment of this functional in the case of a general locally compact quantum group , see @xcite .",
    "we can identify the hilbert space @xmath260 with @xmath222 and we get for the canonical imbedding @xmath261 whenever @xmath117 and @xmath145 .",

    "as in that same paper , some nice conclusions can be drawn from the previous result .",
    "for this we need to introduce some notations .",

    ".      we can be more specific .",
    "define linear maps @xmath287 and @xmath288 on @xmath282 and @xmath281 respectively by @xmath289 and @xmath290 . also define one - parameter groups of automorphisms @xmath291 and @xmath292 on @xmath282 and @xmath281 respectively by @xmath293 and @xmath294 .",
