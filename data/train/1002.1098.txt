    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are bright emitters both at radio and @xmath0-ray wavelengths . in the 1990s the energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ( egret ) on board the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ detected over 65 agn ( mostly blazars ) at @xmath0-ray energies.@xcite in june 2008 , the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ was launched .",
    "its primary instrument , the large area telescope ( lat ) , observes the whole sky mainly in survey mode at energies 100 mev-300 gev.@xcite during its first three months of operation , the lat detected 205 bright @xmath0-ray sources,@xcite of which 106 were high confidence associations with agn.@xcite most of them host bright parsec - scale radio jets.@xcite the @xmath0-ray emission in agn likely originates in the relativistic jet , as suggested by the many correlations found between egret and radio / mm observations of agn .",
    "@xcite@xmath1@xcite further evidence has recently been found using the very long baseline array ( vlba ) observations by lister et al.@xcite who showed that the lat - detected sources have significantly higher apparent jet speeds .",
    "it has also been shown that the brightness temperature of the vlbi core is higher for lat - detected sources and the @xmath0-ray photon flux correlates with the compact radio flux density.@xcite the lat - detected sources also have larger apparent opening angles,@xcite and are more doppler - boosted.@xcite    possible links between the radio polarization of jets and @xmath0-ray flaring has been previously studied , e.g. , by jorstad et al.@xcite who established a connection between superluminal component ejections and @xmath0-ray flaring observed by egret . using single - dish radio observations from the university of michigan radio astronomy observatory",
    ", they found that a local maximum in the polarized flux density was observed simultaneously with the maximum of the @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "another study by lister et al.@xcite compared the egret detections and 15 ghz vlbi linear polarization properties .",
    "they did not find differences between the core properties of egret - detected and non - detected objects , although they found indications that the egret - detected objects have higher integrated linear jet polarization .",
    "in this paper we will use the better sampled , more complete lat data in the same manner and study how the linear polarization properties of the 15 ghz core differ in the lat - detected and non - detected objects .",
    "in our analyses we use the flux - density - limited mojave-1 ( monitoring of jets in active galactic nuclei with vlba experiments ) sample of highly beamed agn.@xcite the sample consists of all agn at declinations @xmath2 which have had a 15 ghz flux density of at least 1.5 jy ( 2 jy at @xmath3 ) at any epoch between 1994.0 and 2004.0",
    ". we have only used sources at galactic latitude @xmath4 following the definitions of the lat 3-month bright agn list,@xcite resulting in a sample of 123 sources .",
    "we have divided our sample into lat - detected ( 30 objects ) and non - lat - detected ( 93 objects ) sources based on the 3-month bright agn list.@xcite    we have used the vlba 15 ghz total intensity and linear polarization observations since 2002 and determined the polarized core flux density @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the stokes parameters , fractional polarization @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the total flux density of the core , and electric vector position angle @xmath10 at all the epochs where polarization cross - hands were recorded .",
    "the core values were defined using the same method as ref .   by taking the mean over nine contiguous pixels centered at the fitted core position . if the polarized flux density was less than five times the rms - value in the @xmath7 and @xmath6 parameters , an upper limit",
    "was defined to be five times the rms - value . in these cases",
    "evpa was not calculated .",
    "in order to study if the polarization properties are connected with @xmath0-ray activity , we have used polarization observations from august 2008 until august 2009 to roughly match the lat observation period .",
    "the lat associations are based on @xmath0-ray data integrated between august and october 2008 .",
    "figure [ f1 ] shows the distributions of the maximum polarized flux density of lat - detected and non - lat - detected sources since august 2008 .",
    "nine of the the non - lat - detected sources in the smallest bin are upper limits .",
    "the medians of the distributions are 45.0 mjy and 21.6 mjy for the lat - detected and non - detected sources , respectively . the gehan s generalized wilcoxon test in the asurv package,@xcite suitable for censored data , gives a probability p=0.0003 for the distributions of the lat - detected and non - detected sources to come from the same population .",
    "the result is not surprising considering that the polarized flux density often follows the total flux density which is also seen to be higher in the lat - detected sources when measured quasi - simultaneously with the lat.@xcite    we also wanted to see if this is due to variability in the sources and in fig .  [ f2 ]",
    "we show the distributions of median fractional polarization of lat - detected and non - lat - detected sources from 2002 until august 2008 and from august 2008 until august 2009 ( lat - era ) .",
    "the median values of the distributions are 2.14% and 1.80% for the pre - lat values of lat - detected and non - detected sources , respectively and 2.50% and 1.86% for the values since august 2008 .",
    "we used the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test to see if the lat - detected and non - detected sources come from different populations and the non - parametric mann - whitney u - test ( m - w u - test ) to see if the lat - detected sources have typically higher values than non - detected ones .",
    "no significant differences are seen when the pre - lat values are used ( k - s test p=0.35 , m - w u - test p=0.16 ) , yet when the distributions from the lat - era are studied , the groups differ significantly ( k - s test p=0.013 , m - w u - test p=0.043 ) .",
    "we calculated the variability indices of fractional polarization ( eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] ) and @xmath11 ( eq .  [ eq2 ] ) in the method of refs .   and .",
    "@xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the maximum and minimum fractional polarization , respectively , measured over all epochs since 2002 , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the corresponding uncertainties .",
    "@xmath17 where @xmath18 is the observed range of polarization angle and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the uncertainties in the two values of evpas that define the range.@xcite    figure [ f3 ] shows the histograms of the variability indices .",
    "it can be seen that none of the lowest variability sources are detected by the lat .",
    "a k - s test indicates significant differences between the distributions , for both variability indices ( @xmath21 for @xmath22 and @xmath23 for @xmath24 ) .",
    "by comparing the median fractional polarization since august 2008 with median values between 2002 and 2008 , we find the sources to be in a higher polarization state when detected by the lat .",
    "this complements our previous findings that the lat - detected sources have higher apparent jet speeds,@xcite higher core brightness temperatures,@xcite larger apparent opening angles@xcite and larger doppler boosting factors,@xcite in kovalev et al.@xcite it was also shown that the lat - detected sources are preferentially found in higher radio activity states during the lat - era .",
    "the differences seen between detected and non - detected objects can be due to doppler - beaming.@xcite as is shown in savolainen et al.@xcite , the lat - detected sources are more boosted , which enhances their observed luminosity more than their non - detected less - beamed counterparts . a higher polarization of lat - detected sources may be explained if the magnetic field in the core is more ordered during the radio / @xmath0-ray flares .",
    "indications that the intrinsic de - aberrated viewing angle in which the source is seen plays a significant role in whether a jet is detected at @xmath0-rays or not , are also seen.@xcite if the radio variations are caused by transverse shocks,@xcite the observed fractional polarization can be modeled using the jet rest - frame viewing angle.@xcite by assuming that the 15 ghz core is a @xmath25 surface and using the jet rest - frame viewing angles from ref .  , we estimated the observed fractional polarization for different shock strengths and fractions of uniform magnetic field using simulated values of maximum fractional polarization from ref .",
    "( their figure a1 ) and equations of ref .  . a uniform shock strength value for all sources does not reproduce our observations very well .",
    "if we let the shock strength vary and choose cases which reproduce the observed fractional polarization within 1% , we see indications that the shocks in bl lacertae objects are stronger than in flat spectrum radio quasars .",
    "further studies are required to confirm our results .    by using the egret observations , lister et al.@xcite found no differences in the 15 ghz core polarization properties of @xmath0-ray - detected and non - detected objects .",
    "they only used single - epoch vlba data while we have used quasi - simultaneous lat and vlba observations .",
    "however , the number of lat - detected sources in our sample is small and therefore we intend to verify our results using the lat 1-year catalog . in this future study",
    "we will also examine the polarization of jet components located downstream from the core .",
