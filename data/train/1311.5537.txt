    "electric dipole moments ( edms ) of nucleons , atoms and molecules , have for many years provided some of our most sensitive probes for new sources of @xmath5-violation in nature , as required for baryogenesis .",
    "there has been significant experimental progress in the past few years @xcite , most recently with the announcement of an impressive limit on @xmath5-odd effects in the polar molecule tho , interpreted as a stringent constraint on the electron edm , @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the new physics reach of these experiments varies depending on the source of @xmath5 ( or @xmath7 ) violation , but can reach 100 s of tev @xcite .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) itself has two sources of @xmath7-violation : the kobayashi - maskawa phase , characterized by the reduced jarlskog invariant @xmath8 @xcite , and @xmath9 which is constrained by the limit on the neutron edm to be below @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "since the value of @xmath11 is unknown , for the purposes of this paper we will treat it as a source of new physics , and focus our attention on the kobayashi - maskawa phase @xcite in the cabbibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing matrix , which is now well tested as the dominant source of @xmath7-violation in the kaon and @xmath12-meson system .",
    "given the continuing improvements in experimental sensitivity to edms , it is natural to ask about the size of the observable edms , @xmath13 , induced by the ckm phase . in practice ,",
    "calculations of these contributions are not available with high precision , and the estimates represent in effect the ultimate level of sensitivity of edm searches to new physics .",
    "one can turn this statement around and ask , given the limited calculational precision available for @xmath14 , what is the largest conceivable size of these ckm - induced contributions ? answering this question would assist us in defining a ` line in the sand ' , corresponding to the level at which a nonzero edm detection would unambiguously be due to new physics .",
    "however , the difficulty in quantifying the size of ckm - induced edms is apparent on noting that similar physical mechanisms , e.g. penguin diagrams in the up - quark sector , are at play in evaluating @xmath7-odd observables in kaon physics . specifically in the case of @xmath15 ,",
    "the hadronic matrix elements are enhanced by factors of @xmath16 compared to naive expectations .",
    "ckm contributions to a number of observable edms have been discussed in the literature , as we will review below .",
    "however , the case of atoms and molecules where the angular momentum is carried by an uncompensated electron spin ( leading to what is often referred to as a ` paramagnetic edm ' ) has not been explored in detail .",
    "paramagnetic edms are an important class of observables , allowing for relatively precise theoretical calculations of the dependence on underlying @xmath7-odd sources of new physics , such as the electron edm . providing an estimate of the ckm contribution , and thus the effective threshold for edm searches ,",
    "is the main goal of this work and the result is summarized below .",
    "first , we define the electron edm operator @xmath0 , and the semileptonic @xmath7-odd operator @xmath17 , [ lcp ] l_cp = - d_e |e f_5 e - c_sp |n n |e i _ 5 e + @xmath17 does not depend on the nuclear spin , gives a contribution to the atomic / molecular edm even for spin - zero nuclei , and is coherently enhanced by the number of nucleons @xmath18 .",
    "this singles out @xmath17 as likely the most important contribution to paramagentic edms among a multitude of other @xmath7-odd four - fermion operators . in general @xmath17 can have isospin dependence , which for this paper we will disregard , taking @xmath17 to be an approximate isoscalar . as defined above , with the fermi constant factored out , @xmath17 is dimensionless .",
    "one can write the shift of atomic / molecular energy levels under an applied external field",
    "@xmath19 as [ de ] = f_d ( d_e + r c_sp ) + the coefficient @xmath20 reflects the relativistic violation of the schiff theorem , and provides large enhancement factors @xcite for heavy paramagnetic atoms , and particularly for polarizable paramagnetic molecules . itself",
    "is a nonlinear function of @xmath19 . ]",
    "the coefficient @xmath21 in ( [ de ] ) has the dimensions of a dipole , @xmath22 cm , and is determined by a ratio of the atomic matrix elements of the @xmath17 and @xmath0 operators . over the years , significant theoretical effort has gone into computing the @xmath20 and @xmath21 coeffecients for different molecular and atomic species ; see _ e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "if only one species is used for an edm measurement , the effects of @xmath17 and @xmath0 can not be separated ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for recent discussions ) . since the experimental sensitivity",
    "is usually reported as an inferred limit on the electron edm , it is convenient to parametrize the effect of @xmath17 as a contribution from an _ equivalent _ edm : [ edmeq ] d_e^equiv r c_sp .",
    "taking the three leading experimental limits on the electron edm , we list the relevant @xmath21 coefficients @xcite , @xmath23 notice that although the @xmath20 coefficients for these systems actually differ widely , the @xmath21 coefficients are approximately the same , reflecting the very similar dynamical nature of the @xmath3-odd perturbations to the electron hamiltonian generated by both terms in ( [ lcp ] ) .",
    "this leaves only mild species - dependence in @xmath24 .    in this paper",
    ", we find that in the standard model the ckm - induced @xmath17 contribution dominates the direct contribution from @xmath0 , and estimate it as c_sp(j ) ~10 ^ -18 , [ result ] where @xmath25 is the reduced jarlskog invariant .",
    "using the @xmath21 coefficients in ( [ rcoeff ] ) , we can translate this into a characteristic ckm background to searches for the electron edm , d_e^equiv ( j)~10 ^ -38ecm .",
    "this is roughly nine orders of magnitude below the best current sensitivity to @xmath0 , from tho @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review the ckm contributions to fundamental fermions and other observable edms . in section  3",
    ", we turn to the ckm contribution to paramagnetic edms , and obtain the result ( [ result ] ) .",
    "we finish with some concluding remarks in section  4 .",
    "in this section , we briefly review existing computations of edms induced by the ckm phase . we will organize the discussion around a simple counting scheme , using the basic symmetries to estimate the largest viable contribution to different classes of edms .",
    "in particular , ckm contributions to flavor - diagonal observables necessarily vanish at first order in the weak interaction , due to the conjugated weak vertices .",
    "nonzero contributions only start at second order @xmath26 , and are necessarily proportional to the reduced jarlskog invariant = s_1 ^ 2s_2s_3c_1c_2c_3 2.910 ^ -5 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the sines and cosines of the ckm angles in the kobayashi - maskawa basis and @xmath29 is the complex phase .",
    "the antisymmetric flavour structure of @xmath25 also leads to additional loop - level suppression of the edms of quarks and leptons in perturbation theory @xcite      in addition to the general constraints above , the edm operator for quarks and leptons breaks chiral symmetry , and thus the coefficient must be at least linear in a chirality breaking parameter . in perturbation theory , this is generically the fermion mass @xmath30 itself .",
    "it turns out that the antisymmetric flavour struture of @xmath25 actually ensures that all 2-loop contributions to @xmath31 vanish @xcite , and the second - order weak exchanges need to be dressed with a further gluonic loop .",
    "thus , the @xmath32-quark edm for example arises only at 3-loop order @xcite , and takes the general form @xmath33 this estimates assigns @xmath34 per corresponding loop , and ignores additional numerical suppression or modest numerical enhancement by logarithms of quark mass ratios .",
    "the factor of @xmath35 enters due to the flavour structure of @xmath25 .",
    "the corresponding contribution to @xmath36 is instead proportional to @xmath37 , and somewhat further suppressed .",
    "the most precise calculation of @xmath38 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .     induced by the ckm phase via a closed quark loop .",
    "the contributions shown are : @xmath39 ( left panel , fig .",
    "1a ) , and @xmath40 ( right panel , fig .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]   induced by the ckm phase via a closed quark loop .",
    "the contributions shown are : @xmath39 ( left panel , fig .",
    "1a ) , and @xmath40 ( right panel , fig .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    edms of leptons are even further suppressed .",
    "a generic @xmath0 diagram involves a quark loop with a minimum of four @xmath41-boson vertices .",
    "such a loop can be attached to the electron line either by two @xmath41-boson lines ( fig .",
    "1a ) , at third order in the weak interaction , or via three virtual photons ( fig .",
    "1b ) , at even higher loop order .",
    "moreover , as mentioned before , the full 3-loop contribution to @xmath0 vanishes once again on account of the implicit antisymmetry of @xmath25 @xcite . an additional gluonic loop is required to generate @xmath0 at 4-loop order .",
    "thus , one can estimate the results for the two families of diagrams in fig .  1 , taking into account all the relevant coupling constants , @xmath42 where in the second line @xmath43 is a soft qcd mass scale ( _ e.g. _ @xmath44 ) accounting for the fact that the loop may be saturated in the ir . to obtain an estimate",
    ", it suffices to take @xmath45 . both contributions to @xmath0",
    "are highly suppressed and give comparable values , @xmath46 a very small number indeed !    to conclude this section , we discuss the origin of the quark mass suppression factors in eqs .",
    "( [ 4loop ] ) and ( [ 5loop ] ) in more detail .",
    "these expressions contain an extra factor of @xmath47 compared to the @xmath32-quark edm estimate , eq .",
    "( [ dq ] ) .",
    "this factor originates from the closed quark loop of fig .  1 , where a complete antisymmetrization over @xmath48 quark masses is applied compared to the open quark line with the @xmath32 flavor as an in- and out - state , where only the @xmath49 and @xmath50 flavors internal to diagram are antisymmetrized .",
    "as a result , the quark diagram can contain @xmath51 , @xmath52 factors in a logarithm , @xmath53 and the power - like gim suppression by @xmath47 is avoided . for the closed quark loop ,",
    "complete antisymmetrization leads to @xmath54 , and consequently the power - like gim suppression by @xmath47 necessarily arises .",
    "explicit calculations of the quark loop in the ckm model giving rise to the triple - gluon weinberg operator @xcite and the magnetic quadrupole moment of the @xmath41-boson @xcite confirm the power - suppression by @xmath47 .",
    "one can also argue that since fig .",
    "1a is third order in the electroweak coupling , the @xmath55 factor is inevitable , as the @xmath41-bosons can be integrated out to give contact @xmath56 interactions @xcite .",
    "then a factor of @xmath57 is required in the numerator , and @xmath58 is the only combination of quark and electron masses that is consistent with all the symmetries of the problem . if , for instance , @xmath59 were to be absent , it would signal a quadratic divergence in the contact limit with loop momenta on the order of @xmath60 . if that were possible , all down - type quarks could be considered massless and setting @xmath61 would nullify the answer .",
    "retaining the finite @xmath59 correction returns us to the estimate ( [ 4loop ] ) .      in practice , these primary fermion edms are not the dominant source of the ckm - induced edms of nucleons , and diamagnetic atoms .",
    "the largest ckm contributions generically arise through @xmath7-odd multi - quark operators , containing ( part of ) the required flavour structure to produce @xmath25 . for 4-quark operators of this type",
    ", there is also the possibility of enhanced hadronic - scale contributions when these operators contribute to the interactions between nucleons and light pseudoscalar mesons . to get an idea of the size of possible enhancements ,",
    "we can write down an expression for the nucleon edm in a form which accounts , as above , for the irreducible requirements , and makes no further assumptions about small parameters , @xmath62 in this limiting estimate , the chiral parameter @xmath43 is taken to be characteristic of the quark condensate .",
    "in all practical estimates , the overall coefficient @xmath63 , but is not known with great precision .    -violating four - quark and semi - leptonic operators . ]    the antisymmetry of @xmath25 requires that the operators obtained by combining weak currents at second order must contain at least two sea - quark flavours , e.g. @xmath49 and @xmath64 . integrating out the @xmath65 quarks at 1-loop via a strong penguin",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ pen1 ] ) allows for the possibility of an enhanced phase , with the gim cancelation factor being rather large , @xmath66 ( or rather @xmath67 since @xmath68 ) .",
    "this penguin - induced 4-quark operator was originally used by khriplovich and zhitnitsky to estimate @xmath69 via @xmath7-odd @xmath70 and @xmath71 vertices entering a pion loop @xcite . in these diagrams ,",
    "the chiral scale @xmath72 is enhanced , while the coefficient @xmath73 roughly scales as @xmath74 , leading to @xmath75 cm .",
    "a somewhat larger estimate , @xmath76 , was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an alternative to generating 4-quark operators at 1-loop is to integrate out charm at tree - level , generating a 6-quark operator with a coefficient @xmath77 .",
    "recently , evidence for enhanced @xmath7-violation in the @xmath78 meson system led to further scrutiny of this contribution by mannel and uraltsev @xcite .",
    "while avoiding the corresponding loop factor , there is suppression by @xmath79 and it remains difficult to obtain reliable estimates for the matrix element of this dimension-9 operator over the nucleon .",
    "scaling estimates suggest @xmath80 again leading to @xmath81 cm @xcite .",
    "atomic edms can be characterized in a similar way , but one needs to account for the schiff theorem .",
    "we will focus on the case of paramagnetic systems below , but for diamagnetic atoms ( such as hg ) schiff screening suppresses the induced atomic edm by a factor of roughly @xmath82 , barring special cases with deformed nuclei .",
    "the leading contribution is determined by the schiff moment @xmath83 , and in addition to contributions from the individual nucleon edms , there is also the possibility of an enhanced contribution from the @xmath7-odd nucleon potential .",
    "indeed , the penguin diagram in fig .  1 will contribute to @xmath84 interactions and thus to the @xmath7-odd nucleon potential , via e.g. kaon exchange .",
    "this mechanism was first studied in @xcite , and reconsidered in @xcite , and may provide a contribution to @xmath85 which is somewhat larger than the nucleon edms .",
    "focussing on @xmath86 , the dominant contribution takes the form @xcite , @xmath87 where @xmath88 provides a dimensionless normalization of the 4-nucleon interactions ; schematically @xmath89 .",
    "the precision of the nuclear calculation leading to the second line above is under scrutiny in the recent literature @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , but will be sufficient for our discussion below .    an estimate for @xmath90 can be obtained along the same lines as those above . recalling that",
    "a factor @xmath91 forms part of the definition , we expect the leading contribution to emerge at first order in @xmath91 , so the estimate takes the form , @xmath92 for @xmath93 , this is roughly in line with the chiral constraints and matrix element estimates of donoghue et al @xcite .",
    "this implies a ckm contribution to @xmath94 .",
    "we turn now to the main topic of this note , namely the ckm contribution to ` paramagnetic ' atoms and molecules containing an uncompensated electron spin . as discussed earlier , we are interested in the edm - equivalent contribution from @xmath17 , eq .",
    "( [ edmeq ] ) .",
    "the highly suppressed nature of @xmath95 reviewed above implies that the dominant ckm background arises from @xmath17 , which we will proceed to compute below .",
    "we first consider a simple scaling estimate along the same lines as those above .",
    "accounting for the required chirality flips , and the factor of @xmath96 required to connect electron and nucleon ( or quark ) lines with the minimal loop factor suppression , we have the following limiting value @xmath97 as we will discover shortly , a more elaborate estimate turns out to be about an order of magnitude lower than ( [ est ] ) with @xmath98 .",
