    "the value of the oxygen adp rapidly decreases in the @xmath4 sample as it enters the metallic phase at low temperature , approaching , but not reaching , the undistorted value ( fig .  [ fig;rietvelddistancesadps](d ) ) .",
    "the slightly enhanced value of this adp at base temperature is presumably a signature of the quenched disorder component due to ca / la substitution , which is a temperature independent quantity .",
    "refinements of the pdf over a range @xmath25    ( not shown ) quantitatively agrees with the rietveld results .",
    "examination of the measured pdfs in the low-@xmath22 region of the data confirm that the enlarged adps seen in rietveld are coming from the presence of non - long - range - ordered jt distorted octahedra .",

    "this appears upside down , as a negative peak , due to the negative scattering length of mn  @xcite .",
    "further , the compound peak at around 2.75    includes the o@xmath13o distances on the octahedron  @xcite .",
    "the first pdf peak for @xmath14 and for all measured temperatures exhibits a shoulder on the high @xmath22 side of the peak .",
    "since at low temperatures the thermal broadening effect will be minor , the appearance of this shoulder indicates the existence of a longer mn@xmath13o bond , and therefore the presence of a jt distortion . for @xmath4 below 180  k ( mi transition temperature ) the mn@xmath13o peak appears as a single , well defined , peak .",
    "additionally , the compound peak describing o@xmath13o distances on the 6  octahedron is sharp for @xmath4 ( undistorted 6 ) and broad for @xmath14 ( distorted 6 ) .",
    "these structural features may be used to monitor changes in the jt content as the sample passes through the mi transition . as the measurement temperature of the @xmath4 sample",
    "is increased above 180  k a shoulder starts to appear on the high @xmath22 side similar to the one seen in @xmath14 sample coinciding with the mi transition observed in transport  @xcite .",
    "this was previously pointed out in the context of a temperature dependent study in  @xcite but we show that the effect is similarly seen when the mi transition is crossed as a function of doping at constant temperature .    quantitative analysis from pdf refinements carried out over a narrow @xmath22-range , reveal the distribution of bond - lengths within the local jt distorted octahedra ( fig .",

    "[ fig;pdfdistancesadps](b ) and ( d ) .",
    "the latter show no anomalies at the mi transition temperature since all the information about the local distortions has been captured by the structure parameters rather than the adps  @xcite .",
    "these observations reinforce the well known result that the mi transition is accompanied by the formation of local jt - distortions in the insulating phase , and , conversely , undistorted octahedra in the metallic regime .",
    "it also demonstrates that the local bond - length distribution in the insulating regime decreases in amplitude with increasing ca content , as opposed to the assumption of the small polaron picture in which the local octahedral distortion is as large as in the endmember  @xcite associated with the charge localized mn@xmath27 sites , while mn@xmath28 sites are undistorted as in .      the pdf yields the structure on different length - scales , revealing the locally jt distorted octahedra at low-@xmath22 and the average , undistorted , structure at high-@xmath22 . by studying how the pdf signal crosses over from the distorted to undistorted as a function of @xmath22 we may extract a correlation length for any local ordering of the jt distorted octahedra .",
    "a variable range pdf refinement of the 300  k data was performed from @xmath29    to @xmath21 , where @xmath21 was increased from 3.5    to 20    in steps of 0.5   .",
    "the @xmath8 bond - lengths extracted from these refinements are shown in fig .",

    "the correlation length of the local jt distortions is @xmath30    at @xmath14 , decreasing to @xmath31  at @xmath4 .",
    "this is very similar to the observation above the jt - transition in  @xcite , albeit the length - scale in the present case appears to be smaller , suggesting the decrease of the local distortion correlation length with ca - doping .",
    "we have tested whether the length - scale of ordered local distortions changes with temperature for the @xmath14 sample .",
    "[ fig;corrlength](a ) shows results of the assessment at 10  k and 300  k and we could not detect a temperature evolution of the characteristic length - scale within the accuracy of the approach .",
    "we also tested whether the observations are dependent on the @xmath22-resolution of the pdf for @xmath4 by doing the analysis from pdfs obtained using q@xmath32 values of 25  @xmath17 and 35  @xmath17 ( open and solid symbols , respectively , in fig .",
    "[ fig;corrlength](b ) ) .",
    "we find that slightly sharper and larger length - scale ( by @xmath2 1   ) is obtained with higher resolution data , giving us an estimate of the uncertainty on this value .",
    "while the absolute accuracy of the applied protocol could be somewhat challenging  @xcite , it still provides very important insights about the average correlation length of the underlying ordered local distortions .",
    "we now turn to the question of phase separation and what our data have to say on this topic .",
    "whilst phase separation with large length - scale domains is clearly dominating in systems with smaller a - site ions such as la@xmath5pr@xmath33mno@xmath34  @xcite , for the systems that show robust cmr behavior such as ca and sr doped , though the phase separation scenario has been invoked , our results suggest that phase coexistence is minimal in the vicinity of the mi transition at @xmath35 , at least for the ca doped state .",
    "the rapid crossover from distorted to completely undistorted as the mi transition is crossed , both as a function of @xmath36 at @xmath4 and as a function of doping , @xmath37 at fixed temperature , would seem to rule out a percolation mechanism for that transition .",
    "observations of phase separation in these systems from other measurements may be a result of extrinsic effects such as doping or strain , or difficulties in data interpretion  @xcite .",
    "the situation may be different at higher doping , such as la@xmath38ca@xmath38mno@xmath7  @xcite , and our results only explicitly address the low - doped region of the phase diagram .",
    "given the strong electron - phonon coupling and relatively large size of underlying structural distortions in the pi phase , it is sensible to utilize structural signatures of the charge localized and delocalized states to explore the existence and to quantify ps in .",
    "in fact , there was one such attempt in the past from earlier  pdf experiments  @xcite .",
    "in that study , a two - phase model based on the local structures of the fm and pi phases was used to refine the experimental pdfs quantitatively .",
    "the model involved @xmath13like undistorted structural phase and @xmath13like distorted structural phase with a distortion size associated with the pi component of the order of 0.23    ( defined as difference between the long and short mn@xmath13o bond ) such as seen in the undoped la - endmember . based on the results ,",
    "a claim was made of the observation of the co - existence of both phases over a wide temperature range .",
    "the fits resulted in approximately 10% of the localized jt phase ( pi ) being present even at the lowest temperature measured ( 20  k ) , whereas at room temperature nearly half of the sample remained in the delocalized ( fm ) phase .",
    "however , we note that in this approach to fitting data the quantification of the phase fraction is highly sensitive to the size of the distortion in the distorted pi phase . at the time of that work",
    ", the small polaron model was widely accepted for the insulating phase . in this model , the magnitude of the distortion associated with the charge localized mn@xmath27 sites is expected to be as large as that in the  endmember  @xcite .",
    "however a later , higher resolution , neutron pdf study  @xcite of the insulating regime of  revealed that the _ local _ jt - distortion amplitude in fact decreases dramatically with the increased ca - content , contrary to the small polaron model assumption .",
    "this observation calls for the early pdf report of temperature evolution of the phase fraction to be revisited and the phase fraction assignment to be re - examined by a model that uses a more realistic assignment of the underlying local structure of the metallic and insulating phases .",
    "here we carried out 2-phase refinements in a fashion similar to the one described earlier  @xcite but with the jt distortions set to those observed in the local structure at 10  k for the @xmath14 composition .",
    "the structure of the undistorted fm phase was set to that obtained by rietveld at  10  k for @xmath4 composition .",
    "this choice is not optimal as both the average and local structure change with changing the ca content .",
    "the changes occurring between @xmath14 and @xmath4 are much smaller than those between @xmath39 and the doped compositions used  @xcite .",
    "we believe that this assumption is therefore more realistic than the one used in the earlier work  @xcite . in the 2-phase refinements",
    "all structural parameters were kept fixed .",
    "the only quantities that were allowed to vary were the phase fraction and isotropic correlated adps that were constrained to be the same for the two component - phases .",
    "typical fits at 10  k are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig;fraction](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "evolution of the observed undistorted fraction with temperature for the two compositions is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig;fraction](a ) .",
    "no significant contribution of the undistorted phase could be detected in @xmath14 sample , whose undistorted fraction ( and conversely distorted fraction ) display almost flat temperature dependence within the accuracy of the assessment .",
    "similarly , the @xmath4 sample displays almost fully undistorted component in the metallic regime , and fully distorted component in the insulating regime , both displaying no temperature dependence , except in the immediate vicinity of the mi transition . corresponding correlated adps obtained from 2-phase fits",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig;longshort-2phase](a ) ( solid symbols ) and compared to the uncorrelated values obtained from single phase fits ( open symbols ) .",
    "in addition to results for the undistorted fraction from 2-phase refinements that suggest an abrupt change with no appreciable doping and temperature dependence across the mi transition , changes in uncorrelated adps observed in rietveld refinement , as well as the observed changes in the local long mn@xmath13o bond ( fig .  [ fig;longshort-2phase](b ) ) are also abrupt and localized to the immediate vicinity of the transition .",
    "this strongly suggests that there is no observable phase separation in association with the mi transition , and that doping and temperature dependencies are rather flat , in contrast to what is expected if scenario of percolation of one phase in a phase separated system , where small changes in phase - composition over a wide temperature range would be observed .",
    "finally , we explore the local structure in the high - temperature rhombohedral phase for the @xmath4 sample .",
    "[ fig;rietveld - ht ] shows raw diffraction data and rietveld refinement fits in this high - temperature region . understanding nanosale character of orbital correlations has always been a fundamental challenge in cmr systems in general , and in manganites in particular  @xcite . in a systematic study combining high energy x - ray scattering with elastic and inelastic neutron scattering has been employed recently to explore the character of the polaron order and dynamics  @xcite .",
    "it was found that , once established , the nanoscale polaron correlations are only weakly temperature dependent . these short - range correlations were found to have a static component seen in the elastic scattering channel , indicative of the presence of a glasslike state of the polarons , as well as coexisting dynamic correlations with comparable correlation length , as observed by inelastic neutron scattering .",
    "it was further established that the elastic component disappears at some characteristic higher temperature @xmath40 , above which the correlations are purely dynamic  @xcite .",
    "the character of nanoscale orbital correlations has been studied at temperatures comparable to the jt - transition in  endmember , and at temperatures below the characteristic temperature scale t@xmath41 , within what is known as the pseudocubic phase ( still  space group )  @xcite .",
    "explorations of orbital correlations in the rhombohedral structural phase at temperatures much higher than both t@xmath42 in  and t@xmath41 in  have been scarce .",
    "an atomic pdf study explored this temperature regime in the undoped  endmember  @xcite , and found that the local jt - distortions persist deep into the rhombohedral phase .",
    "since the pdf method relies indiscriminately on both elastic and inelastic scattering channels , it does not reveal whether the underlying nanoscale orbital correlations are static or dynamic , although it is reasonable to assume that at such high temperature they are probably purely dynamic .",
    "studies of the rhombohedral regime for doped  samples have been lacking to date .",
    "recent high - resolution synchrotron x - ray powder diffraction measurement explored the existence and character of the rhombohedral phase for @xmath43 composition  @xcite .",
    "a change of polaronic behavior at the pseudocubic ( ) to rhombohedral ( 3 ) structural phase transition ( at t@xmath44 ) from nonadiabatic in the  phase to adiabatic in the 3  phase was suggested from resistivity measurements .",
    "these results in conjunction with neutron and x - ray studies showing polaron correlations in the orthorhombic phase were interpreted as a scenario in which the structural transition triggers a crossover between distinct electronic states that may be classified as polaron liquid and polaron gas states , though the density of polarons does not change at this transition , so what this picture really means remains unclear .    in order to shed more light on this part of the phase diagram",

    "[ fig;rietveld - ht](a ) , ( b ) ) , with data at and above 750  k being in the rhombohedral 3  spacegroup . in this spacegroup only a single mn@xmath13o bond distance is allowed , and the temperature dependence of the refined value is shown in fig .",

    "three distinct distances are allowed ; however they refine to almost the same , single value at higher temperatures indicating that on average the mno@xmath10 octahedra are already approximately regular even before entering the rhombohedral phase . however , close examination of the adps ( fig .",
    "[ fig;averagestructure - ht](b ) ) shows that in addition to an anomalous jump in 8d@xmath13o adp temperature dependence at t@xmath3 , indicative of the onset of local jt - distortions in the insulating phase , there is also a hint of an additional jump , albeit smaller in size , at around t@xmath44 , similar to what was observed in  @xcite .",
    "as discussed earlier , the system below t@xmath44 already contains disordered local jt distortions , so this is quite suggestive that the local jt distortions are surviving all the way into the rhombohedral phase , and indeed all the way to our highest temperature data - point at 1050  k. this is confirmed in the low-@xmath22 region of the measured pdfs .",
    "thermal motion of the atoms broaden the pdf peaks making it difficult to resolve clearly the peaks and shoulders directly , but low-@xmath22 refinements of the pdf clearly prefer distorted mno@xmath10 octahedra extending to the highest temperatures , as shown in fig .",

    "pdf analysis shows that jt - distortions in @xmath4 persist in the 3  phase pretty much in the same fashion as they do in  endmember  @xcite , irrespective of the fact that the jt - distortion is crystallographically prohibited .",
    "since the local distortions survive to the highest temperature measured , it is sensible to ask what does in fact change at t@xmath44 from the perspective of the local structural footprint of the electronic / orbital state .",
    "as was suggested earlier  @xcite , at a characteristic temperature t@xmath41 which extends to t@xmath42 for @xmath39 composition ( ) there is a change from presumably polaron glass ( static polarons ) below t@xmath41 to a polaron liquid ( dynamic polarons ) above t@xmath41 .",
    "since clear jt - distortion signatures persist still above t@xmath44 , we suggest that at this point there could be a change in the correlations of the dynamic polarons . at such high temperatures , however , the @xmath22-dependent pdf fitting protocol is not so stable due to the thermal broadening of the pdf signal and resulting loss in information in the signal .",

    "first , we compare experimental pdfs for @xmath4 at the closest available temperatures bracing the t@xmath44 : 650  k data correspond to  phase , whereas 750  k data correspond to 3  phase , as can be verified from inspecting the respective diffraction patterns shown in fig .",

    "further insights can be gained from assessing how well the model that describes the intermediate range pdf data explains the data at low-@xmath22  @xcite . to achieve this ,",
    "a simple two - step procedure was used : in the first step , the pdf data were fit over @xmath45    @xmath46    range ; in the second step the structure parameters obtained from the first step were adopted and kept fixed in a refinement of the pdf over @xmath19    @xmath46  range , with model parameters that describe correlated motion of nearest neighbors  @xcite being the only variables .",

    "the results of this study suggest that there does not appear to be a broad range of phase coexistence in this material through the mi transition as has been widely thought previously .",
    "in contrast , local jt distortions are rapidly suppressed in the metallic phase ( @xmath4 at low temperature ) on entering both as a function of temperature at fixed doping , or as a function of doping at fixed temperature .",

    "the persistent feature that was attributed to the mn@xmath13o long bond in that study may have been the feature that we attribute to a termination effect in the current work since it is longer in the doped compounds than the mn@xmath13o long - bond in undoped lamno@xmath7 and not shorter as we now know to be the case . to understand these systems properly",
