    "among a large variety of laser cooling schemes that have been developed , velocity - selective coherent population trapping ( vscpt ) belongs to a small group of methods by which temperatures below the one - photon recoil energy can be achieved .",
    "one - dimensional realizations of the vscpt - method have been demonstrated for @xmath0he @xcite and @xmath1rb atoms @xcite .",
    "in addition , vscpt experiments with helium atoms have been carried out successfully in two @xcite and three @xcite dimensions .",
    "the fundamental feature on which vscpt relies is the preparation of an atomic dark state ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) which does not couple to the pump lasers .",
    "however , there is a significant difference between conventional dark states and the state of a vscpt gas : in the former case it is preferable to consider situations in which the atomic center - of - mass motion can be neglected .",
    "this is for example the case if all laser fields are propagating in one direction , the corresponding dark state is then simply a superposition of two hyperfine ground states .",
    "by contrast , the dark state of a vscpt gas must depend on the center - of - mass motion to achieve the desired cooling effect .",
    "therefore , the atoms are exposed to two counter - propagating pump lasers with wavenumber @xmath2 .",
    "the dark state of this laser configuration @xmath3\\ ] ] is then an entangled superposition of states that contain both internal ( @xmath4 ) and center - of - mass degrees of freedom ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "it is this existence of entangled atomic coherences which makes the optical properties of a vscpt gas interesting .",
    "our goal is to identify a distinctive optical signal which is directly linked to the atomic entanglement .",
    "we will show that the latter gives rise to a backscattered beam of light when the vscpt gas is probed with a weak signal laser pulse ( sec .",
    "[ backscatter ] ) .",
    "it will be demonstrated that this signal is absent for a mere mixture of ground states and thus would provide a direct test of the entanglement of the atomic system .",
    "this effect can also be interpreted as a transfer of entanglement from a single atom to a single photon ( sec .",
    "[ secqft ] ) .",
    "there are two additional features of the vscpt state which make it a system with very special optical properties .",
    "first , since it is prepared in a dark state one can expect that a vscpt gas also exhibits the phenomenon of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite ; this will be examined in sec .",
    "we remark here that eit in a standing - wave geometry has also been studied by affolderbach _",
    "although the laser configuration is similar to that considered here , the physical system is quite different since the experiments are conducted at room temperature .",
    "a second feature of the vscpt state is that it is a periodic state of matter in position space ( @xmath6 ) . while one may conjecture that this would cause the creation of band gaps in the photonic spectrum it will become clear in our derivations that this is not the case",
    "our aim is to find an optical signature for the entanglement between the atomic internal and center - of - mass degrees of freedom in a vscpt state , as well as to explore its potential for eit effects .",
    "to do so we first describe the features of an atomic vscpt state , which has been experimentally realized with @xcite as well as atoms @xcite .",
    "the atoms are exposed to two counter - propagating pump laser beams which share the same frequency @xmath7 and rabi frequency @xmath8 .",
    "the electronic degrees of freedom of the atoms are modeled by a three - level system in @xmath9-configuration ( see fig .",
    "[ lambda ] ) .",
    "in addition , the atomic center - of - mass motion is treated quantum mechanically . in the one - dimensional cooling scheme considered here the momentum components perpendicular to the pump field",
    "are not observed and can therefore be traced out .",
