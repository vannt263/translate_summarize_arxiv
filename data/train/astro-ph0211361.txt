    "significant energy deposition into the atmosphere below some altitude @xmath39 km , depending on latitude , will tend to create ozone rather than to destroy it , therefore one basic check on our assumption of adopting frequency - dependent attenuation coefficients is to compare our fractional energy deposition versus altitude against the radiative transfer calculations of smith et al .",

    "the gcr ionization rate inputs ( from nicolet 1975 ) were multiplied by 100 to simulate the charged particle flux from a sn at 10 pc , and scaled by @xmath66 for other distances .",
    "this multiplicative scaling factor was chosen simply and solely to give a total sn energy in cosmic rays consistent with what is currently thought to be a representative value .",
    "for @xmath67 pc , the locally observed gcr flux @xmath68 erg @xmath29 s@xmath2 becomes @xmath69 erg @xmath29 s@xmath2 , yielding a total energy @xmath70 erg over a 20 y run .",
    "the corresponding fluence is @xmath71 erg @xmath29 .",
    "the vertical ionization rate profiles are then mapped onto a 2d circular grid , representing a zonally averaged spherical earth .",

    "the `` perturbed '' simulations were compared to the `` base '' simulation to assess the atmospheric changes . for the cosmic ray trials ,",
    "the charged particle fluxes are held constant for 20 y , and the results are then checked to ensure a steady state is achieved .",
    "for the gamma - ray trials , the irradiation is activated on day 60 ( march 1 ) and maintained at a constant level for 300 d ( the sn duration ) , after which it is attenuated abruptly while the model is run for another 19 y , allowing the perturbed atmosphere time to relax to pre - sn conditions .",

    "the global average ozone depletion from enhanced gamma - rays decreases to a few percent by the sixth or seventh year .",
    "figure 4 shows an increasing deviation from a @xmath101 law for the ozone depletion as @xmath16 decreases . in other words , although the fluence or net energy input from gamma - rays varies ( by assumption ) as @xmath101 , the ozone depletion begins to saturate for small @xmath16 .",
    "three processes lead to this deviation :    \\1 ) high production levels of @xmath54 result in large self - destruction of @xmath54 and will somewhat limit the modeled concentrations of @xmath54 ( crutzen & brhl 1996 ) .",

    "\\3 ) finally , the enhanced @xmath54 begins to interfere with other families ( e.g. , chlorine- , bromine- , and hydrogen - containing constituents ) that destroy ozone , thus reducing the resultant ozone destruction from those families ( e.g. , this mechanism for production of @xmath54 due to extremely large solar proton events was discussed in jackman et al .",
    "reactions such as    @xmath102 + @xmath56 + @xmath78 @xmath76 @xmath61 + @xmath78 ( j )    become important .",
    "for cosmic ray simulations , we find that after achieving the perturbed steady state , @xmath54 column densities increase at all latitudes and for all times of the year .",
    "for @xmath89 pc , the largest increases in column @xmath54 ( 650% ) occur over the north pole in late summer , while the smallest increases ( 200% ) occur over the south pole in winter , with an average global increase of about 350% .",
    "corresponding column @xmath4 levels decrease globally and in all seasons by as much as 40% over the north pole , in late summer and by as little as 5% over the equator during may - august for an average global decrease of 22% .",
    "our global ozone reductions are less than those of ruderman ( 1974 ) and reid et al .",
    "( 1978 ) , but consistent with whitten et al .",
    "the gsfc 2d model has been developed to represent the `` present - day '' atmosphere .",
    "winds and small - scale mixing processes rely on an average of meteorological field measurements over the 1979 - 1995 time period and contemporary constituent measurements ( see section 2.1 ) .",
    "the earth s atmosphere has changed dramatically since life first evolved about 3.5 gyr ago .",
    "it has only been since the cambrian period began ( @xmath103 gyr ago ) that molecular oxygen , and hence ozone , have become significant components of the earth s atmosphere .",
    "our computations are , therefore , not applicable to any period before about 0.55 gyr ago .",
    "if the base state ozone in the past atmosphere , which would have been perturbed by a sn , were radically different from that indicated by recent measured levels of ozone , then the modeled transport field could be fairly different from the actual past atmosphere .",
    "fleming et al .",
    "( 2001 ) discussed differences in the total ozone perturbation response from a stratospheric aircraft perturbation .",
    "the studied aircraft perturbations were somewhat similar to a sn perturbation since the major atmospheric impact was in the lower stratosphere .",
    "fleming et al .",
    "( 2001 ) show about a factor of two variation in the global total ozone perturbation response .",
    "another possible concern relating to the atmospheric transport is the input energy from cosmic and gamma - rays .",
    "this excess energy or `` atmospheric heating '' can be quantified and compared with background levels of heating : at an altitude of about 15 km or a pressure of about 100 hpa , the background heating rate is @xmath104 k d@xmath2 ( joan rosenfield , 1994 personal communication ) .",
    "a heating rate of 0.1 k d@xmath2 corresponds to @xmath105 erg @xmath11 s@xmath2 , which is to be compared with the gcr rate of @xmath106 erg @xmath11 s@xmath2 .",
    "( this assumes an ion pair production of 30 @xmath11 s@xmath2 at this altitude [ from nicolet 1975 ] and an energy expended per ion pair of @xmath107 ev [ from porter et al .",
    "our _ ad hoc _ increase by 100 in the gcr rate for @xmath108 pc raises this volume heating rate to a level that is still only @xmath109 of the background rate , which is negligible . a sn would have to be extremely close ( i.e. , @xmath110 pc ) to drastically perturb the atmosphere through heating .",
    "the focus of this study was on the @xmath54 production .",
    "both the cosmic and gamma - rays should also produce @xmath80 ( e.g. , see muller & crutzen 1993 ) .",
    "we tried a sensitivity study including the @xmath80 source in our cosmic ray simulation and assuming 2 @xmath80 constituents are produced per ion pair .",
    "this simulation was only modestly different from the @xmath54-only computation and showed reductions of about 1% or so in the calculated total ozone depletion .",
    "the reductions in the ozone depletion were caused by interference from the @xmath80 family constituents with the @xmath54 family constituents through reactions such as    @xmath82 + @xmath56 + @xmath78 @xmath76 @xmath59 + @xmath78 .",
    "( k )    other potential uncertainties relating to the atmospheric physics include : 1 ) input boundary conditions for the source gases , the progenitors of the more reactive atmospheric constituents ; 2 ) reaction rates and photodissociation cross sections ; 3 ) cosmic ray ionization rates from nicolet ( 1975 ) used for scaling the sn input .",
    "the astrophysics portion of the calculation involves additional uncertainties .",
    "for instance , the _ ad hoc _ factor of 100 increase in the gcr rate for @xmath108 pc was chosen simply so as to produce a cr flux representative of that expected from a sn , and in fact the fluence integrated over 20 yr amounts to @xmath111 erg .",
    "( as noted earlier , however , the 20 yr run time in our model was chosen to ensure steady state would be achieved . ) obviously in a more realistic scenario , the increased flux of cosmic rays at the top of the atmosphere would not lead to a uniform elevation of the ionization rate at all altitudes ; a proper calculation would involve solving the diffusion of the enhanced flux to lower altitudes .",
    "this is beyond our current level of sophistication . in effect , by uniformly augmenting the ionization for all altitudes , we are probably over - representing the increased ionization at the lower altitudes .",
    "second , for the gamma - ray flux we have also avoided the diffusion ( i.e , radiative transfer ) problem by adopting simple energy - dependent attenuation coefficients . although our estimate of the fractional energy deposition versus altitude agrees quantitatively with results from a proper radiative transfer calculation , there may be other intricacies of the process which are not captured in our technique . finally , there is considerable uncertainty in the duration and functional form ( in time ) of both the cosmic ray and gamma - ray fluxes .",
    "we find that the time to reach steady state in both sets of calculations is relatively short , thus it appears that `` flux '' is more relevant than `` fluence '' for our results .",
    "values for the cosmic ray acceleration time @xmath112 within the sn remnant ranging from @xmath113 to @xmath114 yr have been quoted in the literature ( blandford & eichler 1987 , ellis & schramm 1995 ) .",
    "our model run time of 20 yr is toward the lower end of this range , therefore if we were to take the additional step of assigning a physical significance to our model run time , our calculated ozone depletion would represent in some sense an upper limit : larger values of @xmath112 would dilute the cosmic ray energy in time to a greater extent , and lead to smaller ozone depletions .",
    "we feel confident in being able to scale to other values of total adopted energy and `` on '' time based on the limited number of runs which we calculated .",
    "given the current crude level of understanding of cosmic and gamma - ray fluxes from sne , it was thought that more complicated assumptions involving additional free parameters , such as power law or exponentially decaying forms for the fluxes , would be unwarranted .",
    "in order to quantify the impact on life of different levels of ozone depletion , we use the results of madronich et al . ( 1998 ) . from their table 1 and",
    "figure 2 , we take a factor of @xmath115 increase in the biologically active uv flux to be a threshold for significant biological effects .",
    "this increase corresponds to an ozone depletion of @xmath116% , given that the biologically active uv flux scales roughly as the reciprocal of the ozone column ( madronich et al .",
    "there will probably be an interference between the increases in @xmath54 caused by the gamma - rays and cosmic rays , therefore a summation of the separately computed ozone depletions from the two effects will result in a maximum estimate of the total sn influence .",
    "summing our gamma - ray and cosmic ray depletions for @xmath89 pc , and taking into account that our adopted energy is larger than that found in the latest sn study mentioned earlier , we obtain a fiducial `` critical distance '' to significantly disrupt ozone of @xmath117 pc for a sn with a total gamma - ray energy @xmath118 erg .",
    "the impulsive addition of energy into the atmosphere by other types of catastrophes may also lead to the production of @xmath54 , therefore the accompanying destruction of ozone may not be unique to the sn scenario . a geometric dilution factor of @xmath119 for the cross section of the earth",
    "as seen from 10 pc means that the sn gamma - ray energy of @xmath120 erg translates to @xmath121 erg intercepted by the earth . an asteroid with mass @xmath122 g and speed @xmath123 km",
    "s@xmath2 such as the one responsible for the cretaceous - tertiary extinction ( alvarez et al .",
    "1980 ) has @xmath124 erg of kinetic energy ( ke ) , so that even if as little as @xmath125 of the ke were channeled into atmospheric heating , it would rival the sn input . on the other hand ,",
    "the creation of @xmath54 through a sudden event would probably be less long lasting : first , the transport of @xmath54 from the stratosphere to the troposphere would occur over a few years .",
    "tropospheric @xmath54 exists mainly as @xmath59 , and would be removed by precipitation .",
    "second , a localized event in the atmosphere would probably not be communicated globally .",
    "for instance , if an asteroid generated @xmath54 along its trajectory through the atmosphere , it would not necessarily mix globally on a time scale short compared to its destruction time scale . a period of sustained energy input is required to maintain continuously high levels of @xmath54 if the depletion of ozone is to be effective . on the other hand ,",
    "the asteroid scenario is known to have many other disastrous effects in terms of atmospheric pollutants .",
    "for instance the introduction of massive amounts of sulfur , leading to sulfuric acid , is thought to be devastating to life .",
    "for a nearby sn to disrupt life on earth , there must be some finite probability that such an event has occurred within the past several hundred million years . for our galaxy",
    "the sn rate is @xmath1 per century ( cappellaro et al . 1999 ) .",
    "clark et al . ( 1977 ) estimate the sun should pass within 10 pc of a sn during each spiral arm passage , implying a sn rate of @xmath113 gyr@xmath2 .",
    "two key issues affecting the sn rate are ( i ) the vertical scale height @xmath126 over which supernovae ( sne ) are distributed , and ( ii ) the displacement of the solar system from the galactic plane .",
    "the study of clark et al .",
    ", for example , ignores the vertical disk structure and concludes that every passage through a spiral arm results in a close - proximity sn .",
    "an opposing view is presented by van den bergh ( 1994 ) who adopts @xmath127 pc , thereby giving @xmath128 gyr@xmath2 for sne within 10 pc .",
    "maiz - apellaniz ( 2001 ) utilizes a sample of o - b5 stars , precursors to core - collapse sne , obtained from the _ hipparchos _ catalog to determine @xmath129 pc .",
    "he also finds the sun to be @xmath130 pc above the galactic plane @xmath52 a value that is fortuitously less than @xmath126 .",
    "the value @xmath131 pc is a factor of @xmath113 less than that used by van den bergh , and leads to a sn rate intermediate between van den bergh and clark et al .",
    ", i.e. , @xmath132 gyr@xmath2 for @xmath133 pc , or @xmath1 gyr@xmath2 for @xmath134 pc , where we used the fact that the rate varies as @xmath135 .",
    "if the cosmic ray flux scatters off magnetic field irregularities in the interstellar medium , a spread in the arrival times with increasing distance is introduced so that the fluxes vary as @xmath136 rather than @xmath101 .",
    "this comes about because one has a factor @xmath101 due to the random walk in spatial spreading , in addition to the normal @xmath101 geometric factor ( ellis & schramm 1995 ) .",
    "benitez et al . ( 2002 ) argue that the earth lies within a bubble of hot gas caused by recent sne which shields us from the ism magnetic field , and therefore leads to @xmath101 cosmic ray sn fluences .",
    "benitez et al .",
    "make this argument concerning recent sne in the local bubble and the scorpius - centaurus ob association which may have generated @xmath137 sne in the last @xmath113 myr .",
    "the cosmic ray flux @xmath138 erg @xmath29 y@xmath2 they quote using the minimal distance for the sco - cen sne @xmath139 pc ( and assuming a typical cosmic ray acceleration time @xmath140 yr ) is actually about a factor of 10 less than we adopt in this work for @xmath67 pc , leading us to believe the effect discussed by benitez et al .",
    "may produce ozone depletions of only a few percent .",
    "the complications introduced by having the earth be inside a hot bubble which may enhance the cosmic ray flux during an interval in which several successive sne occur are interesting and worthy of more detailed studies .",
    "it may be the case , for example , that the cumulative effect of having many sne occur within a relatively short interval is to elevate the general cosmic ray flux within the local bubble to a level higher than simple @xmath101 fall - off from a single sn would suggest .",
    "in summary , we have calculated detailed atmospheric models to determine the extent of the reduction in ozone due to elevated levels of odd nitrogen induced from gamma - rays and cosmic rays produced in a local sn .",
    "our procedure is as follows : ( i ) we utilize a detailed 2d model for the earth s atmosphere , incorporating the latest advances in photochemistry and transport .",
    "( ii ) for the gamma - ray spectrum we take as input the observed spectrum from sn1987a , scaling the total energy to the most recent value determined by workers investigating core - collapse sne with a red supergiant progenitor . (",
    "iii ) for the cosmic ray spectrum we adopt scaled - up values of the empirically observed ionization rates in the atmosphere from galactic cosmic rays .",
    "( iv ) to estimate the frequency of local sne we utilize recent estimates of global sn rates for spiral galaxies and the results of a recent investigation into the vertical spatial extent of core - collapse sn progenitors .",
    "our primary finding is that a core - collapse sn would need to be situated approximately 8 pc away to produce a combined ozone depletion from both gamma - rays and cosmic rays of @xmath116% , which would roughly double the globally - averaged , biologically active uv reaching the ground .",
    "the rate of core - collapse sne occurring within 8 pc is @xmath1 gyr@xmath2 .",
    "as noted earlier , our calculated ozone depletion is significantly less than that found by ruderman ( 1974 ) , and consistent with whitten et al .",
    "given the @xmath3 gyr time scale for multicellular life on earth , this extinction mechanism appears to be less important than previously thought .",
