    "the so - called `` late veneer '' phase in earth s accretion is sandwiched between two far more dynamic epochs .",
    "the late veneer comes at the end of the giant impact phase of terrestrial accretion , which lasted 30 - 100 myr  @xcite and during which the growing earth underwent numerous impacts with moon- to mars - sized planetary embryos  @xcite .",
    "thus , the late veneer probably represents accretion during the final clearing - out of planetesimals leftover from terrestrial accretion , starting after the moon - forming impact and dwindling in time for @xmath1500 myr . after the end of the late veneer came the late heavy bombardment , a spike in the impact flux that lasted a few hundred million years  @xcite .",
    "evidence for the late veneer comes from the existence of highly - siderophile elements ( hses ) in the mantles of earth , mars and the moon .",
    "simply put , hses are  iron - loving \" elements that tend to partition into metal and should thus be removed from a planet s mantle during core formation .",
    "the abundance of hses on earth imply that it accreted at least an additional 0.3 - 0.7% of an earth mass of material with chondritic composition after the last core - forming event  @xcite , presumed to be the moon - forming impact  @xcite .",
    "the concentration of hses in the lunar mantle is 20 - 40 times lower than the concentration in earth s mantle  @xcite .",
    "as the earth s mantle is about 70 times more massive than the moon s , this naively implies that the earth accreted @xmath12 times more mass in hses during the late veneer than the moon .",
    "however , by taking into account the lunar crust as an additional , possibly dominant , repository for hses  @xcite , @xcite calculated a significantly higher total concentration of hses on the moon . @xcite found a earth - to - moon hse abundance ratio  meaning the ratio in the total masses , not concentrations , of hses in their mantles  of 150 - 700  ( see also the discussion in * ? ? ? * who favor a range from 200 to 1200 ) .",
    "the large earth / moon hse abundance ratio is problematic because the ratio of the physical cross sections of the earth and the moon is only 13.5 .",
    "the measured concentration of hses in the martian mantle is similar to the earth s  @xcite .",
    "taking into account the relative sizes of their mantles , this implies that earth accreted roughly 9 times more mass in its late veneer than mars .    to date , two potential solutions to this problem have been proposed that make vastly different assumptions about the characteristic size of late veneer impactors .",
    "@xcite showed that the large earth / moon hse abundance ratio can be reproduced by a veneer population skewed toward large objects such that almost all of the hses are delivered by a few big impacts with @xmath13  km .",
    "the combination of the small number of impactors and the earth s larger collisional cross section allow the earth to accrete far more veneer mass than the moon .",
    "this model is consistent with the observed patchiness in tungsten isotopes in earth s mantle  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the model of  @xcite requires a veneer made of very small ( @xmath14  m ) planetesimals , which collisionally damp to very low eccentricities and thus increase the gravitational focusing factor of the earth sufficiently to explain the earth / moon hse abundance ratio .",
    "these small planetesimal could at the same time provide the required damping of the eccentricities and inclinations after giant impacts .",
    "bottke et al s model is consistent with planetesimals being born big  @xcite whereas schlichting et al s model is consistent with collisional models that start from small planetesimals  @xcite .",
    "of course , all planetesimals must have undergone some collisional evolution by this point so it is unclear how the veneer size distribution relates to the initial one .    in this paper",
    "we explore the consequences of the `` stochastic late veneer ''  @xcite model for the dynamics and collisional history of the terrestrial planets .",
    "we address the orbital excitation of the terrestrial planets , the collisional regime of veneer impacts on each planet , and the effect of the late veneer on planetary spins .",
    "the orbital excitation of the terrestrial planets can be quantified using the normalized angular momentum deficit @xmath15  @xcite , which measures the difference in angular momentum of a set of orbits from coplanar , circular orbits with the same semimajor axes : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 refer to planet @xmath21 s semimajor axis , eccentricity , inclination with respect to a fiducial plane , and mass .",
    "the current @xmath15 of the solar system s terrestrial planets is 0.0018 ; we refer to this value throughout the paper as @xmath6 .",
    "simulations of terrestrial planet formation have historically produced planetary systems that were overly dynamically excited , i.e. , with @xmath22  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this problem was a result of numerical limitations . including a large population of planetesimals mediated this discrepancy and produced planetary systems with @xmath23  @xcite because dynamical friction from the small bodies acts to damp random velocities in the larger ones .",
    "however , some high - resolution simulations show large increases in the orbital excitation of the entire system at late times by objects that represent less than 1% of the total system mass . for example",
    ", in the simulation illustrated in figures 2 - 12 of  @xcite , a series of close encounters with a roughly lunar - mass embryo more than doubled the eccentricity of the system s earth analog , and roughly doubled the mass - weighted eccentricity of the entire terrestrial planet system  ( see in particular figs . 8 , 9 and 11 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the terrestrial planets orbital eccentricities during the late veneer epoch are poorly constrained .",
    "a large - scale re - arrangement of the giant planets orbits is thought to have occurred during the late heavy bombardment  ( the so - called  nice model  ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . during this instability , secular resonances with the giant planets",
    "may have crossed the terrestrial planet region .",
    "if the orbits of jupiter and saturn evolved slowly the terrestrial planets eccentricities and inclinations would have been excited to larger than the current values  @xcite .",
    "however , scenarios that invoke rapid evolution of the giant planets orbits adequately reproduce the architecture of both the giant and terrestrial planets  @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that if the terrestrial planets @xmath15 at early times was larger than about @xmath24 , then their eccentricities would have been over - excited by the giant planet instability .",
    "given that chaotic diffusion tends to increase rather than decrease orbital excitation in time  @xcite , the only reasonable constraint that we can place is that the excitation of the terrestrial planets after the late veneer phase could not have been larger than this .",
    "our simulations start immediately after the end of the giant impact phase of terrestrial accretion . at this stage there remained a substantial population of planetesimals too small to cause another core - forming impact on earth .",
    "@xcite argued that objects for which the diameter of the iron core was larger than the depth of the earth s presumed magma ocean would trigger a differentiation event  @xcite and thus constrained the maximum size of the veneer to have diameters @xmath25 km .",
    "we model this late veneer population by assuming that it follows a power law in size : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the differential number of objects in a bin of width @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the size - distribution exponent .",
    "@xcite found that the earth / moon hse abundance ratio was best reproduced for @xmath30 and maximum impactor size @xmath31 = 3000 - 4000  km .",
    "we adopt the same parameter range with @xmath29 = 1 , 1.5 and 2 and @xmath31 = 2000 , 3000 and 4000  km , for a total mass in the veneer population of @xmath32 . to generate a population of late veneer impactors",
    ", we determined the size of each object by drawing from a size - frequency distribution with a fixed @xmath29 value and @xmath33 between 1000 - 4000 km .",
    "we neglected objects smaller than 1000 km because 1 ) they are too numerous to include a reasonable number of objects with an n - body approach , and 2 ) for @xmath34 the total veneer mass is dominated by the largest objects such that the @xmath35  km population represents only about 1/4 of the total veneer mass",
    ". although their dynamical influence is probably small , these small bodies may be very important in determining the earth - to - moon hse abundance ratio , as we discuss in detail in sections 7 and 8 .",
    "we assigned an orbit to each veneer particle , consistent with recent simulations of terrestrial planet formation , in particular  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the semimajor axis was randomly chosen between 0.5 and 1.7 au , the eccentricity between 0.1 and 0.6 , and the inclination between zero and @xmath36 .",
    "the other orbital angles were chosen at random from @xmath37 .",
    "the physical density of veneer impactors was fixed at @xmath38 .",
    "given that the orbits of the terrestrial planets during this phase are not known , we chose four different starting configurations with a range of initial @xmath15 values . in the first case ,",
    "the terrestrial planets were placed on orbits with their current semimajor axes but with zero eccentricity and inclinations of @xmath39 for a starting @xmath15 of less than @xmath40 .",
    "this isolates the eccentricity excitation by the late veneer population . in the next two cases we chose @xmath5",
    "= 0.5 and 1 times the current value @xmath6 . in the case of @xmath41 , the actual ( not normalized )",
    "@xmath15 of each planet s orbit was simply halved , then corresponding values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 were chosen for each planet , taking care not to exceed any of the current values .",
    "for @xmath44 we simply put the terrestrial planets on their current orbits .",
    "for the final starting configuration we gave the terrestrial planets their current orbital elements , then artificially increased the eccentricity of each planet to 0.1 .",
    "this produced an @xmath5 value of 3.24 , which we refer to as @xmath45 .",
    "the different choices of @xmath5 reflect our uncertainty in the orbits of the terrestrial planets immediately after the giant impact phase .",
    "for giant impacts to occur the planets orbits must have been at least somewhat eccentric , simply to cause their orbits to cross .",
    "however , the @xmath15 of the terrestrial planet _ system _ need not be very excited for a given pairwise impact to occur , especially if the impactor is significantly less massive than the target . from an inspection of accretion simulations that adequately reproduce the terrestrial planets ,",

    "the primordial rotation of planetary embryos is systematically prograde from the accretion of swarms of small bodies  @xcite .",

    "3 ) and therefore we assume that they have no effect on the planets spins . however , even a modest impact angle can impart a strong spin for a high - speed , high - mass impact .",
    "figure  [ fig : limp_d ] shows the expected spin angular momentum @xmath116 delivered by each accretionary veneer impact , neglecting hit - and - run and erosive impacts .",
    "the amount of angular momentum delivered per impact is scaled by the mass that is actually accreted by the planet according to our collisional model .",

    "the spin angular momentum delivered to venus and mercury by late veneer impacts is far larger than their current spin angular momenta .",
    "this is largely a consequence of their current low spin rates . indeed , tidal dissipation is thought to have significantly altered the spin rates of both planets since their formation  @xcite .",
    "if they underwent an early giant impact and/or stochastic late veneer phase , their primordial spin rates were necessarily orders of magnitude faster than their current ones .",
    "in contrast , the spin rates of earth and mars are only modestly affected by the late veneer .",
    "no impact imparted more than 16% of the earth s current spin angular momentum .",

    "the obliquities of our simulated terrestrial planets with late veneers are isotropically distributed . as was the case for the spin rate",
    ", we do not expect the late veneer to have a strong influence on the obliquities of earth or mars .",
    "however , it is plausible that the late veneer impactors could have imparted a retrograde rotation on the inner planets , especially if mercury and venus primordial spins were relatively slow .",
    "although we have little direct information about their primordial rotation states , the current peculiar spin states of both venus and mercury can be most consistently reproduced if both planets initial rotation was retrograde  @xcite .",
    "indeed , we find that venus and mercury s final rotation states are retrograde in almost exactly half of the simulations , although their outcomes do not correlate so they are both retrograde only about one quarter of the time .",
    "although we did not include the moon in our simulations , its impact environment would be similar to earth s .",
    "the impact velocity @xmath117 is related to the random velocities of impactors @xmath118 as @xmath119 so we can use the velocities of simulated impacts on earth to calculate @xmath118 .",

    "the analysis in the previous paragraph assumed that the same - sized objects impacted earth and the moon . in contrast , @xcite assumed that this could not be the case because if so , the earth - to - moon accretion ratio should simply be the ratio of their gravitationally - enhanced collisional cross sections @xmath131",

    ", @xcite showed that even assuming perfect accretion the large hse abundance ratio could be reproduced with a significant probability thanks essentially to small number statistics .",
    "what we have shown is that , assuming the same impactor masses , all collisions ( except for the 3% of hit - and - run impacts ) on earth result in net accretion whereas 93% of the same collisions result in no net accretion  or , in most cases , in net erosion  on the moon . in this context",
    "the earth was able to accrete hses from large impactors whereas the moon could not .",

    "mercury also can not accrete the largest impactors .",

    "this size limit for accretion is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : limp_d ] , where mercury is not imparted any spin from impacts larger than @xmath151  km because of our assumption that only accretionary impacts impart spin angular momentum .    given that the moon simply can not accrete impactors larger than 500 - 1000  km , a top - heavy population of late veneer impactors must invariably generate a large earth - to - moon hse abundance ratio , as observed .",
    "if , however , the veneer population contained only smaller planetesimals then we would expect the earth - to - moon hse abundance ratio to be closer to the ratio of their accretion cross sections , which can only match observations if the accretion cross section are significantly enhanced by gravitational focusing only feasible for very small ( @xmath152  m ) planetesimals  @xcite .",
    "@xcite s argument is that the earth and moon could have been impacted by different - sized objects if the veneer size distribution were shallow and extended to large objects .",
    "however , bottke et al . effectively underestimated the hse abundance ratios they calculated  as well as the success rate of their simulated populations  by not accounting for non - accretionary or erosive collisions on the moon .",
    "any veneer population that includes impactors larger than 1000 km would naturally produce a large earth - to - moon hse abundance ratio .",
    "the earth was the primary target of the late veneer impactors ( along with venus ) , while the moon simply could not accrete any large bodies .",
    "the hses in earth s mantle could have been delivered by a number of 1000  km bodies or a single @xmath153  km or larger one .",
    "the moon could not have participated in this accretion .",
    "both the earth and moon would have concurrently accreted @xmath154  km bodies , with a ratio of roughly 25 .",
    "thus , veneer impactors with @xmath155  km could have had virtually any size distribution , including that of the present - day asteroid belt , as long as the population included a tail of @xmath156  km impactors . however , the mass in these smaller ( @xmath155  km ) veneer bodies is constrained to have been small enough that the earth did not accrete more than @xmath157 in total .    for our argument to be correct ,",
    "earth must have accreted at least 90% of its veneer mass from @xmath156  km impactors .",
    "the moon of course accreted no bodies this large , although it is possible that it was eroded during this phase ( see discussion in section 8) .",
    "the remaining 10% of earth s veneer could have come from a population of smaller @xmath158  km bodies that the moon would also have accreted in roughly 1:25 proportion .",
    "if more than 10% of earth s veneer came from small bodies then the earth / moon hse mass ratio would drop below the lower measured limit of @xmath159 .",
    "given that a late veneer with a total mass of @xmath104 does a good job of reproducing the earth s actual hse abundance , this implies that the late veneer contained less than @xmath160 in @xmath158  km impactors .",
    "while this is small compared with the planets masses , it is nonetheless five times the total mass in the present - day asteroid belt .",
    "at face value , our results are broadly consistent with the stochastic late veneer model of @xcite . however , there are consequences of our simulations , as well as assumptions of the model and connections with measured constraints , that warrant further discussion .    first , it is important to point out that the start of the late veneer phase was different for each planet .",
    "hses accumulate in the mantle once a planet s core becomes decoupled from the surface , after the last impact large enough to cause differentiation  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the last giant impact certainly occurred at a different time for each planet .",
    "geochemical constraints place this time at roughly 50 - 100 myr for earth  @xcite and before @xmath161  myr for mars  @xcite .",
    "hse accumulation in the martian mantle had thus been ongoing for 50 myr or more before it began on earth , making the duration of the late veneer phase 10 - 20% longer for mars than for earth . the fact that earth and mars have similar hse concentrations in their mantles",
    "@xcite suggests that mars did indeed accrete a modest surplus of veneer compared with earth . if the late veneer were determined purely by the gravitational cross sections @xmath131 ( eq .",
    "6 ) , then by using median values of @xmath118 of @xmath134 for earth and @xmath162 for mars , then the earth / mars concentration ratio should be @xmath163 , assuming that the mantle samples are a good representation of the bulk mantles .",
    "mars thus accreted more than its gravitational share in late veneer , presumably during the interval between its core closure at a few myr and earth s core closure after 50 - 100 myr .",
    "given that the terrestrial planets started our simulations fully - formed , we might expect the earth - to - mars hse abundance ratio to be somewhat underestimated in the simulations , which is indeed the case .",
    "the difference in the timing of core closure on mars and earth , combined with their hse abundances , may offer a glimpse into the prevailing conditions in the early inner solar system . by the arguments presented above",
    ", we think that mars accreted about about 40% of its hses between its core closure and earth s core closure @xmath164 myr later .",
    "this amounts to @xmath165 of mass accreted by mars ( the range assumes that earth s late veneer was @xmath166 ) .",
    "the young earth was of course also accreting during this period . with the median impact speeds from our late veneer simulations , the earth s gravitational cross section",
    "@xmath131 is about 6.3 times larger than mars. earth should thus have accreted up to a few @xmath167 during the time between mars and earth s core closures , i.e. , between roughly 5 and 50 myr after the start of planet formation .",
    "however , it is thought that earth accreted most or at least a significant fraction of its mass during this period  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even if earth only accreted 10% of its final mass during this interval , this represents 40 - 160 times more than that expected from the arguments presented above .",
    "how , then , did mars accrete _ so little _ veneer during this time ?",
    "this is essentially the same issue as the `` small mars '' problem  @xcite .",
    "one possibility is that mars s feeding zone was barren and contained far less mass than earth s .",
    "this is precisely the situation if most of the terrestrial planets mass was concentrated in a belt , and mars was scattered past the edge of the belt  @xcite .",
    "mars growth was effectively stunted by starvation in a low - density region beyond earth and venus .",
    "the grand tack model proposes that the outer edge of the belt exists because it was truncated by jupiter s gas - driven migration  @xcite .",
    "second , perhaps the most striking aspect of the stochastic late veneer model is the top - heavy distribution of veneer impactors .",
    "these bodies are presumably the leftovers of terrestrial planet formation and thus were formed several millions of years before `` time zero '' in our simulations .",
    "the question thus arises of whether the planetesimal population that survived terrestrial accretion should realistically be dominated by @xmath168  km objects .",
    "the initial size distribution of planetesimals is uncertain .",
    "models of planetesimal formation by turbulent concentration can produce planetesimals as large as 100 - 1000 km in diameter  @xcite .",
    "however , the size distribution of the asteroid belt can be reproduced by the collisional evolution of planetesimals that were initially hundreds of km in size  @xcite or by coagulation of planetesimals that were initially only about 100 m in size  @xcite . by the end of terrestrial planet formation",
    ", all planetesimals must have undergone some growth and collisional evolution so it is unclear how the veneer size distribution relates to the initial planetesimal size distribution .",
    "the size distribution of the planetesimals delivering the late veneer is therefore unknown .",
    "if the planetesimal size distribution had a differential power law index of q=1 - 2 then the collisional cross section would have been dominated by the largest bodies .",
    "the collision rate @xmath169 between large bodies ",
    "the collisions presumably required to destroy them  can be very simply estimated as follows : @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the surface density of bodies ( taken to be simply @xmath172 ) , @xmath173 is the keplerian frequency at 1 au , @xmath174 is the physical density of impactors assumed to be @xmath175 , and @xmath62 is the impactor radius .",
    "the typical time between collisions is simply @xmath176 . for @xmath62 = 500  km this simple",
    "estimate yields @xmath177 = 56 myr .",
    "n - body simulations of the giant impact phase in the terrestrial planet region find time scales for the giant impact phase of 10 - 100  myr  @xcite . since the giant impact and collisional timescales are comparable for a population dominated by large bodies , it is plausible that there was population of late veneer bodies dominated by large 1000  km sized impactors .",
    "a third concern with the stochastic late veneer model is that , at first glance , our results appear to suggest that if the earth s veneer came from large ( @xmath178  km ) impactors then the moon should have been significantly eroded .",
    "figure 3 shows that if the moon were struck by the same impactors as earth with the same random velocities , the vast majority of impacts would be in the catastrophic erosive regime .",
    "indeed , figure 5 shows that at the relevant impact velocities the moon is simply unable to accrete objects larger than @xmath179  km .",
    "this discrepancy can be resolved by small number statistics .",
    "our simulations did not include objects smaller than 1000  km , and the @xmath2 in veneer impactors needed to reproduce earth s hse abundance was contained in between 6 and 73 objects , depending on the size range of the bodies ( i.e. , the size of the largest bodies @xmath31 ) and the random number seed . in the simulations earth underwent between zero and 20 veneer impacts with a median of just 5 collisions .",
    "at the relevant velocities the earth s collisional cross section is about 25 times larger than the moon s ( see section 7 ) . given that this is larger than the maximum number of impacts on earth , our simulations are consistent with the moon not undergoing a single impact with a @xmath178  km body .    nonetheless , is it conceivable that the moon could have formed larger than it is and been eroded by a large veneer impact ?",
    "this possibility is not ruled out by our simulations ; it is dynamically plausible that the moon formed with twice its current mass and was later massively eroded by a very large veneer impact",
    ". there exists a model capable of producing a moon more massive than the actual one via a giant impact between the proto - earth and a similar - mass embryo  @xcite .",
    "although this model does produce a moon with the correct oxygen isotope abundance , it may be inconsistent with geochemical evidence that the earth s mantle was not well mixed even at very early times  @xcite .    given that the arguments against the formation of a larger moon are relatively indirect , the possibility that the moon formed modestly larger than it is today appears to be a viable scenario , although we can not place strong constraints on how much larger with the current simulations .",
    "while most giant impacts on the moon would be erosive , more than two - thirds of @xmath0  km impacts would erode the moon by less than 25% . among @xmath180",
    "km objects , only 22% of impacts erode the moon by more than 25% .",
    "the formation of a moon up to , say , 25% more massive than the current one remains a dynamically plausible and interesting scenario",
    ". it may be interesting to search for geochemical or geological signatures of lunar erosion .",
    "finally , we note that the threshold for core formation is poorly understood .",
    "we have inherently assumed that all veneer impactors are below the threshold for differentiation regardless of planet size , impactor size and velocity . in practice",
    ", we suspect that an impactor s must be smaller than the thickness of the planet s mantle to remain in the mantle and avoid sequestering at least a portion of the planet s hses in the core .",
    "however , further work is needed in this area to achieve an understanding of the fate of hses in large impacts .",
    "a sufficiently energetic impact should produce a magma ocean of a given depth , and some earth impacts in our simulations have impact velocities in excess of @xmath181 .",
    "the most energetic impacts in the simulations are only a factor of 5 - 20 smaller than the impact energy in recent simulations of lunar formation  @xcite . in the context of our simulations and collisional",
    "model we have assumed that these impacts deposited hses in earth s mantle , although further studies of magma ocean production and partial differentiation after large impacts would help in the interpretation of our simulations .",
    "in this paper we used n - body simulations to test the stochastic late veneer model proposed by  @xcite .",
    "we found that the model is viable with some constraints .",
    "first , the total mass in the veneer population can not have been much higher than @xmath104 .",
    "if it were there should be a higher concentration of hses in earth s crust .",
    "second , the terrestrial planets pre - veneer orbits were as calm or calmer than their present ones . given that the terrestrial planets angular momentum deficit @xmath15 immediately before the late heavy bombardment must have been less than @xmath24  @xcite , we find a drastically higher success rate in simulations with initial @xmath182 . for somewhat smaller veneer impactors ( @xmath53  km ) ,",
    "the initial @xmath15 could have been as high as @xmath6 .",
    "such low @xmath15 values are consistent with recent simulations of terrestrial planet formation , in particular if the terrestrial planets formed from a narrow annulus of material  @xcite .",
    "@xcite reproduced the large earth / moon hse abundance ratio with a shallow veneer size distribution extending to large ( @xmath183  km ) impactors . using the model for the outcome of gravity - dominated collisions developed by  @xcite",
    ", we showed that the moon simply can not accrete objects larger than @xmath179  km ( fig .",
    "5 ; note that this critical size is velocity dependent and extends from @xmath184  km for relevant parameters ) .",
    "rather , the moon would be modestly eroded by @xmath33=1000 - 4000  km impactors , typically by 10 - 20% . the large earth / moon hse abundance ratio is naturally reproduced by any top - heavy impacting population simply because the moon does not accrete in this regime while earth does .",
    "all that is required is that @xmath185% or less of the veneer s total mass  @xmath186  was initially in small ( @xmath187  km ) bodies , as these are accreted by both the moon and earth in roughly 1:25 proportion .",
    "of course , a later large impact could strip some hses from the moon .",
    "a stochastic late veneer has dramatic consequences for some of the planets .",
    "while this is an accretionary phase for venus , earth and mars , it is an erosive one for mercury and the moon .",
    "mercury typically lost a few percent of its mass via high - speed collisions and in a considerable fraction of cases ( 17% ) an erosive collision would have removed more than a quarter of its total mass . although we did not track the long - term evolution of the impact debris , such erosive impacts may explain mercury s large iron mass fraction  @xcite .",
    "any impact of a @xmath188 500 - 1000  km body would have eroded the moon ( see discussion in section 8) .",
    "likewise , almost any impactor larger than @xmath150 850 - 1600  km would have eroded mercury .",
    "it is worth considering the possibility that the primordial moon was more massive than the current one , perhaps by up to 25% .",
