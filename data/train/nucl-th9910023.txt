    "for a partonic matter in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath11 but out of chemical equilibrium , the parton distribution can be written in the jttner form , @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes different parton species , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the four velocity of the local comoving frame . in the limit of small fugacities ( @xmath16 ) ,",

    "since chemical equilibration of the partonic matter created in heavy ion collisions at rhic is likely to be slow , we shall use the boltzmann distribution of eq.([bf ] ) in the following calculations unless specified otherwise . in this case , the parton density in the local comoving frame is directly related to the fugacity , @xmath23 if partons are taken to be massless . in the above , @xmath24 is the degeneracy factor of parton @xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the thermal quark mass , denoted as @xmath27 , is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the qcd strong coupling . for a qgp in chemical equilibrium , this gives a thermal quark mass @xmath30 when using the exact parton distribution of eq.([juttner ] ) .",

    "[ fig_rate ] the thermal dilepton rates for @xmath91 mev , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the reason for choosing these values will be given in the next section .",

    ", the total thermal dilepton yield is significantly enhanced by gluonic processes .    the appreciable difference between the results shown in fig . [ fig_rate ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_full ] can be qualitatively understood from the scaling behavior given in eq.([scale ] ) . because of the quadratic dependence on parton fugacities , gluonic processes become dominant over the @xmath3 process when gluons greatly outnumber quarks ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "even if @xmath95 is fixed but @xmath96 in an under - saturated partonic matter , both @xmath97 and @xmath98 become logarithmic divergent , indicating that gluonic processes become more important than @xmath3 annihilation when the parton system is further away from chemical equilibrium .    to illustrate this quantitatively ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig_full2 ] the full - equilibrium results in fig .",

    "[ fig_full2 ] to fig .",
    "[ fig_rate ] is due to the logarithmic terms in eq.([scale ] ) , which come from the thermal quark mass in the regularized partonic cross sections given by eqs.([wgq]-[wgg ] ) .",
    "we also see in figs .",
    "[ fig_full]-[fig_full2 ] that the lo @xmath99 annihilation process is most effective in producing high invariant - mass dileptons because all incoming energy can be used .",
    "in contrast , there are one or two partons in the final state in the compton and two - gluon fusion processes to carry away part of the incoming energy . to produce high mass dileptons from these processes",
    "thus requires more energetic partons , which are less available .",
    "therefore , the three curves in fig .",
    "[ fig_rate ] corresponding to the above three processes exhibit increasingly larger slopes .",
    "in this section , we estimate the thermal dilepton yield in central au+au collisions at rhic by integrating the thermal dilepton rate over the space - time four volume , which will be taken from a schematic model . also , we will study the feasibility of observing the thermal dilepton signal in experiments by comparing it with the drell - yan background .",
    "starting from eq.([rate1 ] ) and using @xmath100 , we first integrate over @xmath101 instead of @xmath82 and then over @xmath80 , @xmath79 and @xmath83 as in previous section .",
    "this gives @xmath102 which then leads to @xmath103 in the above , @xmath104 is the initial proper time when the parton system first reaches thermal equilibrium , and @xmath105 is the final proper time when the temperature drops to @xmath106 ( chosen to be @xmath107 mev ) and the partonic matter makes a transition to the hadronic matter . the rate @xmath108 depends on @xmath109 implicitly through the time evolution of the variables @xmath110 and @xmath27 .",
    "we note that while the pair rapidity @xmath82 of the two partons in the initial state is equal to the pair rapidity @xmath111 of the dilepton in the lo @xmath3 annihilation process , they are different in gluon - induced processes . however , if we assume that the expansion of the partonic matter follows the bjorken scaling , the dependence of the thermal dilepton yield on @xmath111 and @xmath82 must have the following functional form : @xmath112 as a result of boost invariance of the integrand on the right - hand side of eq.([rate ] ) .",
    "this gives @xmath113 the same argument applies to @xmath101 , and it is easy to verify that @xmath114      first , we need to specify the time evolution of partons in the quark - gluon phase created in heavy ion collisions at rhic .",
    "earlier studies @xcite based on kinetic equations including @xmath115 gluonic processes have shown that thermal equilibrium is achieved first , and both gluon and quark fugacities increase as the system evolves . however , since the quark - gluon plasma has only a finite lifetime of a few fm/@xmath116 , chemical equilibrium is unlikely to be established , and parton fugacities thus remain well below the value of one . to take into account such effects , we follow fig . 25 of ref.@xcite by simply assuming that the parton fugacities increase linearly with the proper time , @xmath117    in an ideal hydrodynamic description , temperature of the partonic matter decreases as @xmath118 , which then leads to a decrease of the rapidity density of transverse energy as @xmath119 . in the parton cascade model",
    ", the time evolution of the rapidity density of transverse energy depends sensitively on the magnitude of parton cross sections and densities @xcite .",
    "since we do not expect the rapidity density of transverse energy to change more than 25% during the partonic stage of rhic heavy ion collisions @xcite , we assume for simplicity that @xmath120 , given by @xmath121 is a constant .",
    "this then leads to the time evolution of temperature as @xmath122 in the above , we have used @xmath123 at central rapidity at @xmath104 and @xmath124 fm .",
    "also , we neglect the transverse expansion throughout this study . the effect of transverse expansion on the production of dileptons of mass above @xmath125 gev has been shown to be very small in heavy ion collisions at rhic energies @xcite",
    "this is expected because high mass dileptons are mainly produced in the early stage of the partonic matter , when the transverse flow has not much developed .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_time ] the time evolution of fugacities and temperature given in eqs.([timef ] ) and ( [ timet ] ) are shown .",
    "we see that the temperature decreases faster than that given by the scenario of entropy conservation , i.e. , @xmath126 , as parton production increases the entropy .      as in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the parton equilibration is studied using kinetic equations , we assume that at the proper time @xmath104=0.7 fm/@xmath116 , thermal equilibrium is established at a temperature @xmath127 mev .",
    "we also take the same gluon and quark densities at @xmath104 as in ref .",
    "@xcite , and obtain the following values for the initial parton fugacities @xcite : @xmath128 with these values , we find that quarks and antiquarks make about 15% of the partons and the thermal quark mass is about 75 mev if the strong coupling constant is evaluated at the normalization scale of 2 gev .",
    "subsequent expansion of the partonic matter is assumed to follow the bjorken scaling .",
    "we have evaluated the thermal dilepton yield using eq.([dndm2dy ] ) , and the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_default ] . also shown is the yield from primary drell - yan hard collisions using a k - factor of @xmath129 , obtained from fitting the e772 data , to take into account higher - order contributions . as in thermal dilepton rates shown in fig.[fig_rate ] , we find that the compton processes produce more dileptons than both the lo @xmath3 annihilation and the two - gluon fusion processes .",
    "this also indicates that the conventional way of using a k factor of 2 to account for all higher - order contributions @xcite underestimates the possible large enhancement from gluonic processes .",
    "we note that , despite the enhancement from gluonic processes , the total thermal dilepton yield is still a factor of 30 or more ( depending on the dilepton mass ) below the drell - yan yield .",
    "it is thus unlikely that thermal dileptons from the partonic matter can be observed in heavy ion collisions at rhic .",
    "the small thermal dilepton yield discussed in the above default scenario is mainly due to the small number of quarks and antiquarks compared to that of gluons assumed in the initial conditions for the partonic matter . while we have used the ratio of initial quarks to gluons that is consistent with minijet calculations based on perturbative qcd together with initial and final state radiations , it is possible that additional soft partons may be produced .",
    "also , there may be already some chemical equilibration before the thermal stage starts at @xmath104 .",
    "both could then lead to initial quark fugacity that is larger than the estimate from minijet calculations .    to obtain an upper limit for the thermal dilepton yield ,",
    "we assume that quarks and antiquarks are in relative chemical equilibrium with gluons at the initial time @xmath104 , i.e. , @xmath130 , although both are still out of full chemical equilibrium . requiring the same value of total @xmath131 at central rapidity as before and using the same @xmath104 and @xmath132 , we obtain from eq.([detdy ] ) the following initial parton fugacities for the upper limit ( ul ) : @xmath133 this gives a ratio of 3/5 for the sum of quarks and antiquarks to the total number of partons , similar to that in an ideal gas of gluons and quarks with @xmath134 .    using the same time evolution as given by eqs.([timef ] ) and ( [ timet ] ) , we have evaluated the thermal dilepton yield with the above initial parton conditions , and the results are shown in fig.[fig_equal ] . because of increased number of quarks and antiquarks , the contribution from the lo @xmath3 process is increased by a factor of about @xmath135 , while gluonic processes become less important in comparison . as a result , the total thermal dilepton yield is about a factor of six higher than that in the default scenario .",
    "depending on the dilepton mass , this is still about a factor of @xmath136 or more below the drell - yan yield .",
    "the thermal dilepton yield is sensitive to the initial conditions , such as @xmath104 and @xmath132 , for the partonic matter .",
    "for example , the contribution from @xmath3 annihilation given in eq.([rate2 ] ) depends on temperature as @xmath137 the thermal dilepton yield can be large if the partonic matter starts at a very high initial temperature @xmath132 . in the following",
    ", we study the dependence of the thermal dilepton yield on the parameters @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath104 and @xmath132 .    for a fully - equilibrated qgp at @xmath127 mev with @xmath134 and an initial proper time @xmath140 fm/@xmath116",
    ", the rapidity density of transverse energy is @xmath141 at central rapidity .",
    "this is more than an order of magnitude larger than most model estimates of the final @xmath120 .    on the other hand , eq.([dndy ] ) with @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath140 fm/@xmath116 and @xmath127 mev in the default scenario gives at central rapidity @xmath144 including additional @xmath145 from subsequent string fragmentation gives a final @xmath146 gev at central rapidity , which is comparable with predictions from most event generators and cascade models for heavy ion collisions at rhic energies .    in the following , we shall study the dependence of thermal dilepton yields on the initial conditions that have same value of initial @xmath120 at central rapidity . according to eq.([detdy ] ) , this is equivalent to taking initial conditions with the constraint @xmath147 we have already studied the effect due to the increase of the quark fraction in the partonic matter . here",
    ", we study the dependence on initial conditions with a fixed @xmath148 , i.e. , with same values of both @xmath149 and @xmath150 .    using the same time evolution given by eqs.([timef ] ) and ( [ timet ] ) , the lo @xmath3 annihilation process gives @xmath151 it is seen that this contribution depends only on one dimensionless variable @xmath152 .    in fig.[fig_dep",
    "] , we show the value of the last integral in the above equation as a function of @xmath152 . as @xmath132 increases , the dilepton yield at a fixed mass @xmath89 increases as the variable @xmath152 shifts to the left , and the yield saturates at the high temperature limit .",
    "the slow increase and final saturation with increasing initial temperature @xmath132 deviate from the naive expectation based on eq.([t0dep ] ) .",
    "this is due to the constraint on the total @xmath120 in eq.([constraint ] ) , which requires that as the initial temperature increases , the initial volume and/or the initial parton fugacities become smaller , thus making the total dilepton yield less sensitive to the initial conditions .",
    "we also see that the yield of higher - mass dileptons depend more strongly on the initial temperature .",
    "however , in mass range of @xmath153 gev , where the yield of thermal dileptons is closer to the drell - yan yield , the variable @xmath152 has a value between @xmath154 to @xmath155 when the default choice of @xmath127 mev is used .",
    "fig.[fig_dep ] thus shows that the maximum increase one can obtain by increasing @xmath132 while keeping the same total @xmath120 is only @xmath156 at dilepton mass of @xmath125 gev and no more than a factor of 2 at dilepton mass of @xmath157 gev .",
    "therefore , thermal dileptons are still well below the drell - yan yield even if we allow the maximum increase of the upper limit results in fig .",
    "[ fig_equal ] .",
    "same studies can be carried out for the compton and two - gluon processes , but they involve more parameters besides the dimensionless variable @xmath152 due to the presence of the thermal quark mass @xmath27 .",
    "relations similar to eq.([dep ] ) can still be obtained except for the logarithmic factors shown in eq.([scale ] ) .",
    "similar conclusions thus hold as long as the screening mass is not extremely small .",
    "in the present study , only leading - order processes have been considered . for low - mass dilepton production , higher - order effects",
    "have been studied @xcite using the hard - thermal - loop ( htl ) resummation method with effective propagators and vertices .",
    "it has been found that two - loop diagrams can give contributions at the same order as one - loop diagrams .",
    "numerical calculations have shown that in heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc energies the two - loop contribution from the bremsstrahlung processes is important only for dileptons with mass @xmath158 and becomes less important than the leading - order contribution for dileptons with mass @xmath159 gev @xcite . since our study mainly concerns dileptons with mass above @xmath125 gev ( @xmath160 )",
    ", we do not expect that the inclusion of these processes will significantly change our results .    however , there are still uncertainties in our results .",
    "first of all , the divergence in the dilepton production cross sections has been simply regularized by the thermal quark mass .",
    "studies that take into account higher - order effects using the thermal field theory have indeed shown that for low mass dilepton or photon production in the qgp the thermal quark mass provides a self - consistent screening effect @xcite .",
    "however , the dependence of the dilepton production cross section on the thermal quark mass differs from that based on the lowest - order perturbative calculations as used in our study .",
    "also , using different parton distributions can lead to different dependence of the cross sections on the thermal quark mass @xcite . since we have not carried out a self - consistent calculation including higher - order effects and have used the boltzmann distribution instead of the quantum distribution , the coefficients that appear in association with the thermal quark mass as given in eqs.([screen1 ] ) and ( [ screen2 ] ) are expected to be different when a more complete calculation is carried out . to illustrate this uncertainty ,",
    "we show in fig.[fig_mu2 ] the results from changing the screening mass by a factor of two but with the same default initial parton conditions . since dilepton yields from the compton and two - gluon processes roughly scale as @xmath161 and @xmath162 , respectively , sizable differences are seen .",
    "we have only considered dilepton production from the stage where partons have reached thermal equilibrium .",
    "the contribution from the pre - thermal stage has not been included . also , we have not considered chemical equilibration during the pre - thermal stage , which could change the initial conditions of the partonic matter such as the fugacities @xmath138 and @xmath139 . with the dilepton production cross sections given in section [ sec - xsection ] ,",
    "the pre - thermal dilepton yield can be calculated using a pre - thermal parton distribution that is either parameterized or from a parton cascade code . with the latter",
    ", the entire time evolution of parton thermal and chemical equilibration can be studied , so the separation of pre - thermal and thermal stages , which is rather crude , is unnecessary . in this way",
    ", the evolution of parton fugacities can be self - consistently determined , and all secondary dileptons from the partonic stage can be calculated . in a previous study @xcite ,",
    "we have carried out a calculation of secondary dileptons from the lo @xmath3 annihilation process within the parton cascade code zpc @xcite , where initial parton fugacities were determined directly from the hijing model @xcite . since the default hijing model gives too few quarks and antiquarks , with the ratio of the sum of quarks and antiquarks to the total number of partons being only 4.5% ( compared with the ratio of 15% in the default scenario of the present study based on minijet calculations using the perturbative qcd ) , the thermal dilepton yield in ref.@xcite is lower than the default result in this study by a factor of 10 .    in summary",
    ", we have studied thermal dilepton production in heavy ion collisions at rhic energies . in particular ,",
    "contributions from gluonic processes and their dependence on the initial parton conditions are investigated .",
    "we find that gluonic processes significantly enhance the thermal dilepton yield as one expects more gluons than quarks in the partonic matter formed in heavy ion collisions at rhic .",

    "our results show that thermal dileptons can compete with those from the drell - yan process only in a rather ideal case , when the initial energy density is higher than most current expectations , and parton chemical equilibration proceeds fast so that quarks are close to relative equilibrium with gluons .",
