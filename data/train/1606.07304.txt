    "the current astronomical and cosmological observations indicate that the universe is in an epoch of accelerated expansion .",
    "the source of this acceleration , dubbed dark energy ( de ) , is now under active investigation ( for a review see the book  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one of the distinctive properties of de is its large negative pressure , which is comparable in magnitude with its energy density . to model de ,",
    "various approaches are employed , from the simplest @xmath0cdm model , where the de energy density comes from a cosmological constant which does not change during the evolution of the universe , to modified and multidimensional theories of gravity .",
    "one of the most popular ways to describe de is through models with various scalar fields . for such fields",
    "one can introduce some effective equation of state @xmath1 , relating the pressure of the fields ( _ i.e. _ @xmath2 ) with the energy density of the fields ( _ i.e. _ @xmath3 ) .",
    "it then becomes possible to subdivide all such fields into two large classes : non - phantom fields , for which @xmath4 ( for instance , quintessence scalar fields ) , and phantom fields , for which the equation - of - state parameter @xmath5 is less than @xmath6 .",
    "the recent observational estimates give @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath8 @xcite , _ i.e. _ , the possibility is not excluded that some of the matter filling the universe acts as phantom matter .",
    "when describing the accelerated expansion of the universe , it is usually assumed that de is distributed homogeneously and isotropically on the largest scales .",
    "this , however , does not exclude a possibility that de may cluster on relatively small scales comparable to sizes of galaxies or even of stars where one might expect an interesting interplay between the normal tendency of gravity to pull matter together versus the tendency of de to act repulsively .",
    "for these cases one could form compact objects , dubbed de stars , both with a trivial and with a nontrivial topology of the associated spacetime @xcite .",
    "in particular , if these types of objects contain phantom scalar fields one can construct localized solutions that can be used in describing configurations both with a trivial ( star - like ) @xcite and with a nontrivial ( wormhole - like ) spacetime topologies  @xcite .    apart from the aforementioned star- and wormhole - like spherically symmetric configurations , one can consider extended objects supported by scalar fields but having symmetries other than spherical .",
    "one can look for cylindrically symmetric cosmic strings .",
    "cosmic strings are extended configurations which could form in the early universe at phase transitions associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "different types of cosmic strings have been considered in the literature ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . of particular interest to the phantom cosmic strings found in this paper are cosmic strings constructed from various types of scalar fields @xcite , including models with two interacting scalar fields @xcite .",
    "another category of extended objects are planar symmetric domain walls which are topological defects arising in both particle physics and cosmology ( see , _ e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "they separate a spacetime into several domains along a single coordinate .",
    "the domain walls we find here arise from regions with fast spatial variation of the scalar fields . depending on the behavior of the field near the wall",
    ", solutions describing such objects can be subdivided into thin - wall solutions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , for which the scalar - field energy density can be replaced by the delta function , and thick - wall solutions @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the characteristics of the aforementioned compact and extended objects will depend on the specific type of fields employed in their modeling . in the present paper",
    "we consider all four types of configurations ( domain walls , boson  stars \" , wormholes , cosmic strings ) constructed from two interacting phantom scalar fields .",
    "one caveat in regard to the  star \" solutions of the present work is that they have masses on the order of the planck mass  they are not objects with a stellar mass . for this reason ,",
    "the spherically symmetric solutions that we find in this work are called phantom balls .",
    "the systems with two ordinary scalar fields are well known from quantum field theory , where they are used to obtain solitary wave solutions @xcite .",
    "when a gravitational field is present , such systems have also been repeatedly considered in the cosmological and astrophysical contexts ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in our previous works",
    "we have obtained a number of solutions with two scalar fields ( both normal scalar fields and phantom scalar fields ) which can be employed to describe astrophysical objects and also when considering cosmological solutions .",
    "we have considered regular spherically and cylindrically symmetric solutions @xcite ; cosmological solutions  @xcite ; thick brane solutions supported by normal and ghost scalar fields  @xcite . here",
    "we will extend those studies .",
    "in the simplest case a phantom scalar field can be introduced by changing the sign of the kinetic term in the lagrangian .",
    "consistent with this , we choose the lagrangian for two scalar fields @xmath9 as in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath10~,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the scalar curvature , @xmath12 is the newtonian gravitational constant .",
    "we have designated the two scalar fields in as phantom fields due to fact that we have taken their kinetic terms ( _ i.e. _ @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) to have the  wrong \" sign ( _ i.e. _ a @xmath15 sign ) rather than a the  correct \" sign ( _ i.e. _ a @xmath16 sign ) .",
    "more precisely though phantom fields require that the equation of state parameter @xmath5 ] should satisfy @xmath18 .",
    "putting a @xmath15 in front of the scalar field kinetic energy term can give @xmath18 , as in the original work on phantom fields by caldwell @xcite , but this is not necessarily true .",
    "we will find that for most of our systems that our scalar fields are phantom ( _ i.e. _ @xmath18 ) for some range of coordinates , but will be non - phantom ( _ i.e. _ @xmath4 ) for other ranges of coordinates",
    ". the corresponding energy - momentum tensor will then be @xmath19      \\right\\}~.\\ ] ] since @xmath20 and @xmath21 we can use to calculate the equation of state parameter @xmath22 .",
    "as mentioned above we will find ( for three of the four systems studied ) that the @xmath18 for some range of spatial coordinates while being @xmath4 for other ranges .",
    "thus the scalar fields , @xmath23 are partially phantom fields in that they satisfy @xmath18 for some range of coordinates , but do not give @xmath18 everywhere . and variation of the lagrangian gives the einstein and scalar field equations in the form @xmath24 & = & -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial ( \\phi,\\chi ) } ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 .",
    "below we will consider only static problems , for which eqs .",
    "- give the system of ordinary nonlinear differential equations with the potential energy @xmath26 here @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the masses of the scalar fields , @xmath29 are the coupling constants , and @xmath30 is some constant whose value will be given for each of the four types of solutions considered below .",
    "our previous investigations of such kind of systems @xcite indicate that regular solutions of the system - with the potential do exist only for certain eigenvalues of the parameters @xmath31",
    ". we will find the same result here  that only certain values of @xmath31 lead to regular solutions .    in the following four sections we will present the details of the four different kind of phantom field solutions  planar  phantom \" domain wall , spherically symmetric phantom ball , phantom wormhole and cylindrical phantom cosmic string .",
    "many of the comments as to the physical viability of these various solutions ( or not ) we will save for the concluding section .",
    "we begin by studying the simplest extended solution supported by two phantom scalar fields  the domain wall .",
    "the reason for the scare quotes around  phantom \" in the section heading is due to the fact that , although our two scalar fields have the wrong sign in front of their kinetic energy terms , the equation of state parameter for these domain walls will never be less then @xmath6 as we show at the end of this section .",
    "since domain walls have planar symmetry we choose the metric in the form : @xmath32 the metric function @xmath33 depends on the coordinate @xmath34 only .",
    "this metric describes a 2d domain wall embedded in a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional spacetime . using eqs .  , , and",
    ", one can derive the following einstein and scalar field equations : @xmath35 ~ , \\\\",
    "\\chi^{\\prime \\prime } + 3 \\frac{a^\\prime}{a}\\chi^\\prime & = &      \\chi\\left[2\\phi^2 + \\lambda_2(\\chi^2-m_2 ^ 2)\\right ] ~.      \\label{field_wall_2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have absorbed @xmath36 via the following rescaling : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "the primes denote differentiation with respect to @xmath34 .",
    "looking at and one can see that these are essentially the friedman equations but with the role of space and time coordinates exchanged ( _ i.e. _ @xmath41 ) . the constant from the potential is chosen to be @xmath42 ^2 +     \\frac{\\lambda_2}{4 } \\left [ \\chi^2 ( 0 ) -m_2 ^ 2 \\right ] ^2+\\phi ^2 ( 0 )   \\chi ^2 ( 0 )   ~,\\ ] ] where the initial values , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , are given below . from one",
    "can see that this choice for @xmath30 ensures that @xmath45 . from and for the metric in the energy density is @xmath46    we choose the boundary conditions at @xmath47 in the form : @xmath48 following the procedure for finding solutions of refs .",
    "@xcite , we found the masses @xmath49 presented in table [ eignvlsdw ] .",
    ".the eigenvalues @xmath49 versus @xmath44 with @xmath50 for domain walls .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath51 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results of numerical calculations for the scalar fields , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , are given in figs .",
    "[ phi_vs_x_string ] , [ chi_vs_x_string ] .",
    "the behavior of the scalar fields is similar to what was found for the phantom balls .",
    "the scalar field @xmath52 started at @xmath54 and as @xmath55 approached some constant , non - zero value .",
    "the scalar field @xmath53 started at some non - zero value and approached @xmath56 as @xmath55 .",
    "the metric functions @xmath57 are given in figs .",
    "[ a_vs_x_string ] , [ b_vs_x_string ] .",
    "these metric functions both approach some constant negative value as @xmath55 .",
    "the energy density , @xmath58 , is given in fig .",
    "[ epsilon_vs_x_string ] .",
    "near @xmath59 the energy density , @xmath58 , changes sign and then goes asymptotically to zero from below .",
    "since the cosmic string is of infinite length its total mass is infinite , but the relevant quantity is mass per unit length . to obtain this",
    "we integrate the energy density , @xmath60 , over the full range of @xmath61 and @xmath62 but along @xmath63 we integrate a finite length , @xmath64 , and then divide by this to get mass per unit length . the energy density is @xmath65 now the mass of a length @xmath64 of the cosmic string is @xmath66 where the @xmath62 integration gives @xmath67 and the @xmath63 integration gives @xmath64 .",
    "the factor @xmath68 comes from @xmath69 , the volume factor for the spatial part of the metric in . from and the mass per unit length , @xmath70 , of the cosmic string solution is @xmath71 d \\rho ~.\\ ] ] we calculated @xmath72 for a range of different initial values of @xmath44 and @xmath43 and in general found that @xmath73 . in one case when @xmath74 and @xmath75 we did find by extrapolation that a very small positive value for @xmath72 .",
    "however , for this point we could not trust the extrapolation .",
    "thus in this case the conclusion was that @xmath73 in general .",
    "the equation of state parameter , @xmath76 for the cosmic string is shown in fig . .",
    "as in the previous three cases we have defined the equation of state parameter in terms of the radial pressure ( for the cosmic string this means pressure in the @xmath61-direction ) .",
    "the equation of state parameter has some range of @xmath61 near @xmath77 for which @xmath18 ( _ i.e. _ the scalar fields have a phantom equation of state ) and so we call these solutions phantom cosmic strings . as with the wormhole and phantom ball solutions the region where one has phantom behavior is near the origin",
    ". from fig .",
    "one can see that @xmath5 diverges .",
    "these divergences occur at the places where @xmath78 as shown in fig . .",
    "we have studied several hypothetical compact and extended astrophysical objects supported by two phantom scalar fields .",
    "when distributed homogeneously and isotropically over the universe such phantom fields could be the source of the present accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "however , one can imagine situations when in the process of evolution of the universe there could arise inhomogeneous distributions of such phantom fields that might lead to the formation of localized or partially localized configurations such as those considered here .",
    "the  phantom \" domain walls investigated in section are in fact not phantom since , despite having negative sign kinetic energy terms for the scalar fields , the equation of state parameter associated with the @xmath34 direction is always @xmath79 as shown in fig . .",
    "leaving aside the equation of state parameter , these domain wall solutions do have the  unphysical \" characteristic that their energy density , @xmath80 , is everywhere negative @xmath81 .",
    "this leads one to strongly suspect that these solutions are unstable _",
    "i.e. _ that they would dissipate rapidly .",
    "this is actually a good , physical feature since normal domain walls tend to dominate the energy density of the universe @xcite and can be ruled out observationally . thus the domain walls studied here , exactly because of their hypothesized unstable nature , could be of more consequence than normal domain walls  these domain walls might form and quickly dissipate , perhaps leaving some small imprint on the cmb . in regard to observational constraints regular domain walls are more problematic .",
    "however , one would still need to confirm that these domain walls are unstable by performing some stability analysis as in @xcite , and one would need to determine if they would leave some imprint on observables from the early universe .",
    "in section we found phantom ball solutions .",
    "in contrast to the domain wall solutions , the phantom ball solutions can properly be call  phantom solutions \" since for some range of @xmath82 near the origin their equation of state parameter does satisfy @xmath83 as seen in fig . .",
    "these solutions might be viewed as phantom versions of magnetic monopole solutions @xcite that occur in grand unified theories ( gut ) , except that the phantom ball solutions of section involve scalar fields coupled to gravity , while the gut monopoles are a combination of gauge and scalar fields .",
    "these gut monopoles have been shown to be problematic to cosmological observations @xcite ( one can solve the  gut monopole problem \" via inflation ) .",
    "the phantom ball solutions had some range of @xmath82 where the energy density was positive , @xmath84 as seen in fig .",
    "however , when integrating the energy density over all space we found that the mass of the phantom balls was negative as seen in fig . .",
    "thus as with the domain walls , the phantom ball solutions are probably unstable ( of course for both solutions one should check this in detail , but it would be odd and interesting if either of these solutions were stable under a more detailed analysis ) . as with the domain walls , this indication that the phantom ball solutions are unstable / unphysical is good from the physical standpoint in that both of these solutions would not remain around long due to their postulated instability .",
    "however , these two solutions might form in the early universe and leave some signature on observables from the early universe ( _ e.g. _ they might leave an small imprint on the cmb ) yet due to their postulated instability , decay away before causing problems with cosmological observations like those associated with regular domain walls and/or gut magnetic monopoles .",
    "in section we found wormhole solutions supported by the phantom fields .",
    "the wormhole solutions were the only solutions of the four types that we studied that had ( at least for some set of parameters ) positive mass as shown by fig . .",
    "since these solutions did not have any horizons ( _ i.e _ the metric ansatz functions , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , did not got to zero or become negative ) the wormholes are traversable  in principle \" meaning @xcite simply that they do not have horizons . in order to determine if these wormhole solutions are travesable  in practice \" ( meaning that the tidal forces can be engineered to be small enough to allow an observer of some given length , @xmath87 , and able to withstand some local gravitational acceleration of @xmath88 , to pass through the wormhole throat without being tidally disrupted @xcite ) is more difficult to determine , especially given that the solutions we have obtained are numerical .",
    "however , given the wide range of shapes for the metric ansatz functions @xmath85 and @xmath86 , it is likely that one could also engineer these phantom wormholes to be traversable  in practice \" .    finally in section we found global , phantom cosmic string solutions .",
    "similar to the cases of the phantom ball solutions and phantom wormhole solutions , the equation of state parameter satisfied @xmath18 for some range of @xmath61 , as shown in fig .",
    ", making the term phantom cosmic string appropriate . also ,",
    "as in the case of the phantom ball solutions , although for some ranges of @xmath61 the energy density of these cosmic strings was positive , @xmath84 , the mass per unit length was negative , @xmath73 .",
    "( there was some very particular choice of initial conditions , namely @xmath74 and @xmath75 , which might have given a very small , positive @xmath72 , but we could not determine if this was a numerical artifact or not ) . as with the domain wall solutions and the phantom ball solutions the fact that @xmath73 indicates that these solutions are likely not stable .",
    "now in the case of the domain wall and phantom ball solutions this postulated instability is desirable from a physical point of view , since ordinary domain walls and gut magnetic monopole solutions ( the rough equivalent of the phantom ball solutions ) cause difficulties in regard to cosmological observations . on the other hand normal cosmic strings",
    "are thought to play a potential role in structure formation @xcite in the universe .",
    "the postulated instability of our phantom cosmic string solution would rule out their use for structure formation , but as with the domain wall and phantom ball solutions , the phantom cosmic strings might leave some imprint on cosmological observables such as the cmb .",
