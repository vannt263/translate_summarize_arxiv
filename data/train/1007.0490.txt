    "extra neutral gauge bosons , known in the literature as @xmath0 , appear in many proposals for beyond - the - standard model ( bsm ) physics ; for a review , see for instance @xcite . here",
    "we focus on _ minimal _ @xmath0 , previously studied in @xcite , which stand out both for their simplicity , and because they could arise in several of the above mentioned bsm scenarios , such as , _",
    "e.g. _ , grand unified theories ( guts ) and string compactifications .",
    "following @xcite , we consider a minimal extension of the sm gauge group that includes an additional abelian factor , labeled @xmath4 , commuting with @xmath5 .",
    "the fermion content of the sm is augmented by one right - handed neutrino per family .",
    "we require anomaly cancellation , as this allows us to write a renormalizable lagrangian . if family - universality is imposed , then the anomaly cancellation conditions yield a unique solution : @xmath6 , where @xmath3 and @xmath7 are baryon and lepton number respectively . , with @xmath8 arbitrary coefficients .",
    "however , the @xmath9 component can be absorbed in the kinetic mixing in the class of models we consider .",
    "] however , if the requirement of family - universality is relaxed , it can be shown that the following set of family - dependent charges satisfy the anomaly cancellation conditions : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 are the lepton flavours , and @xmath12 are arbitrary coefficients .",
    "we will consider a specific example of such _ non - universal _",
    "@xmath0 in the following .    in the basis of mass eigenstates for vectors , and with canonical kinetic terms",
    ", the neutral current lagrangian reads @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the photon field coupled to the electromagnetic current , while @xmath15 are the massive states , which couple to the currents @xmath16 respectively , obtained from @xmath17   \\ , \\overline{f } \\gamma^\\mu f \\,$ ] and @xmath18 \\ ,",
    "\\overline{f } \\gamma^\\mu f \\,$ ] via a rotation of the @xmath19 mixing angle @xmath20 . the explicit expression of the latter reads @xmath21 .",
    "thus , under our minimal assumptions , only three parameters beyond the sm ones are sufficient to describe the @xmath0 phenomenology : the physical mass of the extra vector , @xmath22 , and the two coupling constants @xmath23 . in the following discussion , we normalize these couplings to the sm @xmath24 coupling , namely @xmath25 .    .",
    "the yellow band represents the region of couplings compatible with a gut , whereas dots and lines correspond to specific benchmark models or full supersymmetric gut models , see @xcite for details.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "because guts are one of the motivations for considering minimal @xmath0 , it is interesting to give an estimate of the constraints that a gut would imply on the weak - scale couplings @xmath26 . for choosing the boundary conditions at unification scale @xmath27 , we normalize all charges as in @xmath28 , and take @xmath29 gev .",
    "we allow the @xmath0 coupling at unification scale to vary within the interval @xmath30 , and using the rge of the model we obtain the gut - favoured region of weak - scale couplings , shown in fig.[gut ] for the universal case @xmath31 .",
    "since the boundary conditions at scale @xmath27 are symmetric under the reflection @xmath32 , it is evident from fig .",
    "[ gut ] that mixing effects in the rge ( due to the non - orthogonality of the generators @xmath9 and @xmath2 ) are important .",
    "the gut - favoured regions for non - universal models , computed along similar lines , can be found in @xcite .",
    "the measurements providing constraints on minimal @xmath0 can be divided into two classes : electroweak precision tests and direct searches at the tevatron .",
    "measurements performed at lep1 and at low energy mainly constrain @xmath19 mixing , whereas data collected at lep2 ( above the @xmath33 pole ) constrain effective four - fermion operators . to compute the bounds from ewpt on minimal @xmath0",
    ", we integrate out the heavy vector and use the effective lagrangian thus obtained to perform a global fit to the data .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ chi model ] , for the universal ` @xmath34 model ' , corresponding to a particular direction in the @xmath26 plane often considered in the literature .",
    "the cdf and d0 collaborations have derived , from the non - observation of discrepancies with the sm expectations , upper limits on @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) , @xcite . to extract bounds on minimal @xmath0 ,",
    "we compute the same quantity at nlo in qcd , and compare it with the limits published by the experimental collaborations .",
    "the comparison between bounds from ewpt and from the tevatron is most clear if we plot them in ( coupling _ vs. _ mass ) , for a chosen direction in the @xmath37 plane , as it is done in fig .",
    "[ chi model ] for the @xmath34 model .",
    "we see that bounds from ewpt have a linear behaviour , because all the effects due to the @xmath0 in the low - energy effective lagrangian depend on the ratio @xmath38 , whereas bounds from the tevatron become negligible above a kinematic limit , which is of the order of 1 tev .",
    "thus for low masses the tevatron data give the strongest limits , while above a certain value of @xmath22 ( which is of the order of 500 gev for the @xmath34 model ) , bounds from ewpt are stronger . in particular , for models compatible with guts the strongest bounds are those given by ewpt .     at 7 tev , and 400 pb@xmath39 at 10 tev ) for the @xmath34 model",
    "( right ) present bounds and discovery prospects of the lhc at 7 tev and 50 pb@xmath39 for the _ muonphilic _ model with @xmath40 .",
    "for @xmath41 , both the bounds from the tevatron and the lhc reach are indeed weaker , because of finite - width effects not included in the figure , but the general message is unaffected .",
    "the yellow bands correspond to the gut - favored region , see section [ sect : gut].,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]   at 7 tev , and 400 pb@xmath39 at 10 tev ) for the @xmath34 model .",
    "( right ) present bounds and discovery prospects of the lhc at 7 tev and 50 pb@xmath39 for the _ muonphilic _ model with @xmath40 . for @xmath41",
    ", both the bounds from the tevatron and the lhc reach are indeed weaker , because of finite - width effects not included in the figure , but the general message is unaffected .",
    "the yellow bands correspond to the gut - favored region , see section [ sect : gut].,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "the present schedule foresees that in 2010/2011 the lhc will run at 7 tev in the center of mass , collecting up to 1 fb@xmath39 of integrated luminosity @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to ask whether there are any minimal @xmath0 which are both allowed by present constraints and accessible for discovery in such early phase . to answer this question ,",
    "we have performed a nlo analysis similar to the one used in extracting bounds from tevatron data , requiring the @xmath0 signal to be at least a @xmath42 fluctuation over the sm - drell yan background .",
    "the results are displayed for the @xmath34 model in fig .",
    "[ chi model ] , where a comparison with present bounds is made .",
    "we see that for @xmath43 pb@xmath39 ( the luminosity approximately foreseen at the end of 2010 ) , no discovery is possible . on the other hand , for @xmath44fb@xmath39",
    "some unexplored regions become accessible ; however , @xmath0 compatible with guts are still out of reach , and more energy and luminosity will be needed to test them .",
    "we have seen that universal models are strongly constrained by present data . on the other hand ,",
    "when we consider non - universal couplings to leptons , the bounds can be significantly altered .",
    "in particular , let us consider the case where @xmath45 , which we called ` muonphilic @xmath46 '",
    ". let us further assume that kinetic mixing is negligible , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath47 . in this case , the @xmath0 has no coupling to the first and third leptonic families , in particular it has no coupling to the electron . as a consequence ,",
    "bounds from ewpt are strongly relaxed , the only surviving constraints coming from @xmath48 and @xmath49-@xmath50 scattering ( nutev ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the tevatron reach is limited , as already noted in section [ bounds ] , to @xmath51 tev : therefore the lhc has access to a wide region of unexplored parameter space already with a very low integrated luminosity at 7 tev , as shown in fig .",
    "[ chi model ] .",
    "we have discussed the present experimental bounds and the early lhc reach on minimal @xmath0 models , showing that present constraints can not be neglected when assessing the discovery potential of the early lhc . in particular , we have found that exploration of universal models , coupled to @xmath2 , may need more energy and luminosity than those foreseen for 2010/2011 , in particular for values of the couplings compatible with guts . on the other hand ,",
    "some non - universal models which are weakly constrained by present data , such as the _ muonphilic _ @xmath0 , could be discovered at the lhc with very low integrated luminosity .",
