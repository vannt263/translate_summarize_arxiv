    "its favourable inclination angle of @xmath2 makes m33 a prime subject for the study of the detailed structure and stellar content of a spiral galaxy like our own .",
    "the distance to m33 has been determined _ via _ several methods : freedman , wilson & madore ( 1991 ) determined a distance of 850 kpc by using cepheid - type variables , i.e.  a distance modulus @xmath3 mag , but scowcroft et al.(2009 ) revisited this to @xmath4 mag . by using rrlyrae - type variables , sarajedini et al .",

    "2008 ) are exquisite probes of the star formation history of galaxies . with their high luminosity ( @xmath1160,000 l@xmath12 ) and low temperature ( @xmath134500 k ) ,",
    "agb stars dominate the appearance of galaxies at near - infrared ( near - ir ) wavelengths .",
    "this is aided further by the low extinction at ir wavelengths compared to that at optical wavelengths .",
    "more massive stars , up to @xmath14 m@xmath12 , become red supergiants ( rsgs ; levesque et al .  2005 ; levesque 2010 ) and they can be used to trace the more recent star formation history over about 1030 myr ago .",
    "stars at this advanced level of evolution exhibit strong radial pulsations on timescales of typically 1501500 days ( e.g. , wood et al .  1992 ;",

    "; rsgs contribute less in total , but their mass loss sets the conditions within which the ensuing supernova develops ( van loon 2010 ) .",
    "the most - evolved agb stars pulsate in the fundamental mode , which has the largest amplitude , with less - evolved agb stars and rgb stars pulsating in an overtone with a smaller amplitude ( wood 1999 ) . though no less powerful , the amplitude of pulsation expressed in terms of magnitude , being a relative scale , diminishes with increasing time - averaged luminosity ( wood et al .",
    "1992 ; van loon et al .",
    "2008 ) making it more difficult to detect the pulsation of rsgs than of lower - luminosity agb stars ( though the photometric errors for rsgs are also smaller ) .    detecting _ variable",
    "_ agb stars is a powerful tool in reconstructing the star formation history of a galaxy as these stars are in the final stages of their evolution and hence their luminosity is more directly related to their birth mass than that of less - evolved agb stars that still undergo significant evolution in luminosity .",
    "various variability surveys have been conducted in m33 , mostly at optical wavelengths and with cadences too short to adequately identify lpvs . among the most comprehensive monitoring campaigns",

    "( 2006 ) , the direct project ( macri et al .  2001 ; mochejska et al .",

    "mcquinn et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , on the other hand , identified variables in m33 on the basis of five epochs of mid - ir observations performed with the _ spitzer _ space telescope .",
    "the main objectives of the project are : to construct the mass function of lpvs and derive from this the star formation history in m33 ; to correlate spatial distributions of the lpvs of different mass with galactic structures ( spheroid , disc and spiral arm components ) ; to measure the rate at which dust is produced and fed into the ism ; to establish correlations between the dust production rate , luminosity , and amplitude of an lpv ; and to compare the _ in situ _ dust replenishment with the amount of pre - existing dust .",
    "this is paper i in the series , presenting the methodology used in the monitoring campaign and search for variable stars , the properties of the photometric catalogue of stars in the inner square kpc , and cross - identifications in various other relevant photometric and variability catalogues .",
    "subsequent papers in the series will discuss the galactic structure and star formation history in the inner square kpc ( paper ii ) , the mass - loss mechanism and dust production rate ( paper iii ) , and the extension to a nearly square degree area covering much of the m33 optical disc ( paper iv ) .",
    "observations were made with three of ukirt s imagers : uist , ufti , and wfcam .",
    "the wfcam observations cover a much larger part of m33 and are discussed in paper iv in this series .",
    ".log of uist observations of each of 4 quadrants ( `` q '' ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     on three consecutive nights in august 2005 the ufti imager was used instead , in the k - band ( ukirt filter k98 ) only .",
    "the ufti camera provides @xmath15 pixels of @xmath16 , and a slightly larger area than covered with uist was mapped with nine slightly overlapping fields .",
    "the mosaic was started and finished with the central field , which thus received twice the integration time on a particular night .",
    "the same 9-point dither pattern and 20 s integration time per frame were employed , but due to the slower survey speed the integration time per field amounted to only 9 min per night .",
    "two repeats on the following nights resulted in 27 min total integration time per field ( 54 min for the central field ) . in regions of overlap some stars received longer total integration times .",
    "a standard star was observed in the same manner as with uist , and the same orac - dr recipes were used as before .",
    "all ufti observations were combined to create one mosaic . in doing this ,",
    "a `` super - sky '' was constructed by combining the peripheral 8 fields in the pixel domain ( i.e.  without aligning them in the celestial coordinate system ) via their modal pixel values rejecting the 4 highest ( out of 24 ) values , and applying a box modal filter to smooth out small - scale residuals due to repeated incidences of stars .",
    "this super - sky was then subtracted from each field , their background intensity levels were brought in relative agreement by subtracting the mode from each field ( 10 counts per pixel were added to the central field to establish agreement with the peripheral fields ) , and finally the fields were aligned in the celestial coordinate system and combined normalised by the total exposure time per pixel .",
    "the resulting ufti k - band mosaic is shown in fig .  1",
    ". the central @xmath17 diameter region of the nuclear star cluster is unresolved .",
    "this is surrounded by a region of @xmath18 diameter with a considerably higher stellar density , the `` bulge '' . outside",
    "that , the image is dominated by the inner part of the disc of m33 , although it is difficult to make out the spiral arm pattern that is a conspicuous feature of m33 at larger distances from the nucleus .",
    "photometry was obtained for all stars within each frame by automated fitting of a model of the point spread function ( psf ) , using the daophot / allstar software suite ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "depending on the conditions we used either a constant or quadratically - varying psf .",
    "for the images with a constant - psf model we selected 1530 isolated psf stars ; for the other images we selected 50100 psf stars . the final psf model was made from the frame from which all neighbours of the psf stars had been subtracted .",
    "all psf stars were selected based on their @xmath19 ( goodness - of - fit ) and `` sharpness '' value ; ideally , @xmath20 and sharpness @xmath21 for stars with realistic uncertainty estimates .",
    "the resulting psf - subtracted image was then examined , rejecting any psf stars that had not subtracted perfectly from the image .",
    "the individual images were aligned using the daomaster routine , which computes the astrometric transformation equation coefficients from the daophot / allstar results .",
    "we combined the individual images using the montage2 routine ( stetson 1994 ) , and then co - added these three j- , h- and k - band images with the imarith task in iraf to create a master mosaic of the central @xmath0 of m33 .",
    "a master catalogue of stars was then created by application of daophot / allstar to this master mosaic , using over 100 psf stars to create the ( quadratically - varying ) psf model .",
    "we thus obtained photometry for 18,518 stars .",
    "the master catalogue was used as input for allframe , which simultaneously performed psf - fitting photometry on these stars within each of the individual images .",
    "the psf created from the master mosaic did not fit perfectly to the stars in the individual images , mainly because of variations in the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "therefore , we used instead the psfs created for each image separately .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the @xmath19 and sharpness values _ vs_.  k - band magnitude for one of our individual frames .",
    "we removed non - stellar objects by setting limits on the @xmath19 value , per individual frame .",
    "we did not set limits on the sharpness value .",
    "stars were selected with @xmath19 values below the dashed line in fig .  2 ( but this differs for other frames ) .",
    "for this frame , most stellar objects have @xmath22 , but one can notice some bright objects with slightly larger @xmath19 values ; this may be due to inaccuracies in the adopted psf model .",
    "we also removed objects from the catalogue if they obeyed the @xmath19 criterion in only 10% of the measurements for that object . in this way",
    "our final catalogue has 18,398 stellar objects .",
    "the average @xmath19 and sharpness values of objects in the catalogue are shown in fig .",
    "aperture corrections to the psf - fitting photometry were determined using the daogrow routine ( stetson 1990 ) to construct growth - curves for each frame from which all stars had been subtracted except the psf stars .",
    "we then applied the collect routine ( stetson 1993 ) to calculate the `` aperture correction '' , i.e.  the difference between the psf - fitting and large - aperture magnitude of these stars .",
    "we added this value to each of the psf - fitting magnitudes .",
    "photometric calibration was then performed in a two - step manner .",
    "first , the standard star measurements were used to calibrate the frames on those nights . for the frames without standard star measurements we adopted the documented zero points (",
    "although this is not really needed ) .",
    "airmass - dependent atmospheric extinction corrections were applied adopting the extinction coefficients derived by krisciunas et al .",
    "( 1987 ) . in the second step ,",
    "we calibrated the frames relative to one another .",
    "for this , we selected approximately 1000 stars in common between all frames belonging to a specific quadrant , within the magnitude interval @xmath23 $ ] , and averaged the magnitudes of these selected stars in each frame .",
    "the photometry was brought in line with each other by applying corrections between @xmath24 to 0.067 mag ( but usually much smaller ) .",
    "checks on the overlap regions showed that no additional corrections had to be applied to the photometry between the four quadrants .",
    "finally , the photometry was transformed onto the 2mass system by using the tranformation equations derived by carpenter et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .      to estimate the completeness of our catalogue and the effect of blending we added 300 artificial stars in each of 5 trials to the master mosaic using the daophot / addstar task ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "we added stars in 0.5-mag bins starting from @xmath25 mag until @xmath26 mag ( until 21 mag in @xmath27 and 21.5 mag in @xmath28 ) .",
    "stars were positioned randomly in the image and poisson noise was added .",
    "then , we repeated the daofind / allstar / allframe procedure on the new frame as described before . once the photometry was done and the final list created we used daomaster to evaluate what fraction of stars was recovered . as one can see in fig .",
    "4 our catalogue is essentially complete down to @xmath29 mag , complete to @xmath30% down to @xmath31 mag ( near the rgb tip , see below ) , dropping to below 50% at @xmath32 mag .",
    "the j - band reaches similar completeness levels but at about a magnitude fainter , and the h - band lies somewhere in between those two .",
    "we also examined the accuracy of our photometry by adding artificial stars to one of the individual frames .",
    "like before , we repeated the photometry for this frame after adding 300 stars in each of 5 trials , where the added stars were given magnitudes @xmath33 .",
    "the difference between input magnitude and recovered magnitude is small , @xmath34 mag , except very near the centre of m33 , @xmath35 , where it reaches @xmath36 mag ( fig .  5 ) ,",
    "i.e.  the recovered stars are brighter than the input stars .",
    "we attribute this to severe blending in the unresolved nucleus of m33 .",
    "the same pattern is seen for @xmath37 and 18 mag just with increased values for @xmath38 .",
    "stars that are located near the edges of the images are recovered with the same degree of flux conservation as stars elsewhere in the images , so we conclude that the photometry is accurate also for stars near the frame edges . at @xmath32 mag",
    "most of the recovered stars are brighter than the input stars irrespective of distance from the centre . by then , crowding has become substantial : the stellar density reaches @xmath390.11 star per square arcsec down to @xmath40 mag .",
    "the scientific objectives of our project concentrate on the use of agb stars and rsgs , that have @xmath41 mag , hence our analysis is not seriously compromised by the completeness limit and blending of stars except within the inner few arcseconds of m33 .",
    "it is also important to note that , while _ absolute _ photometry in crowded regions may be compromised , _ relative _ photometry between images can be more accurate , and variability throughout a _ series _ of measurements may be detected with confidence at a level  or below that  of the errors on individual measurements .",
    "variable star candidates were identified with the newtrial routine ( stetson 1993 ) which uses the technique developped by welch & stetson ( 1993 ) and stetson ( 1996 ) .",
    "this method first calculates the @xmath28 index : @xmath42 here , observations @xmath43 and @xmath44 have been paired and each pair @xmath45 has been given a weight @xmath46 ; the product of the normalised residuals , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the deviation of measurement @xmath43 from the mean , normalised by the error on the measurement , @xmath49 .",
    "note that @xmath50 and @xmath51 may refer to measurements taken in different filters . if @xmath52 . ]",
    "the @xmath28 index has a large positive value for variable stars and tends to zero for data containing random noise only .    in circumstances where we are dealing with a small number of observations or corrupt data we gain from also calculating the kurtosis index : @xmath53 the value of @xmath54 depends on the shape of the light - curve : @xmath55 for a sinusoidal light variation , where the source spends most time near the extrema , @xmath56 for a gaussian distribution , which is concentrated towards the average brightness level ( as would random noise ) , and @xmath57 for data affected by a single outlier ( when @xmath58 ) .",
    "the variability index that we calculate in this paper depends on both the @xmath28 and @xmath54 indices and is defined by ( stetson 1996 ) : @xmath59    measurements can be paired if they are taken close in time compared to the ( expected ) period of variability  which for the type of stars we search for within the context of this programme is of order 100 days or longer .",
    "if within a pair of observations only one measurement is available for a particular star then the weight of the pair for that star is set to 0.5 .",
    "stetson ( 1996 ) extended this principle to involve more than two measurements at a time : three measurements @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 taken within a time - span less than the shortest period can be paired as @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 rather than just @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "there is no discernable difference in the variability index for different pairing schemes ( fig .",
    "6 ) , and we decided to use stetson s extended method of pairing here .",
    "7 shows the variability index @xmath66 _ vs. _  k - band magnitude , where the dashed line indicates our threshold for detected variability : @xmath67 . there is a remarkable `` branch '' of variable stars between @xmath6818 mag which are likely agb stars that show mira - type variability , with hardly any fainter variables and a modest number of brighter variables .",
    "histograms of the variability index for several k - band magnitude intervals in the range 1618.5 mag are shown in fig .",
    "8 . to determine the optimal variability threshold , a gaussian function was fitted to each of these histograms . while the gaussian function is a near - perfect fit to the symmetrical distributions at low values for @xmath66 , the distributions show a pronounced tail towards higher values for @xmath66 .",
    "the departure from the gaussian shape occurs typically around @xmath69 .",
    "we thus identified 812 variable stars in the central square kiloparsec of m33 .",
    "( a further 6 were rejected on the basis of their large @xmath19 values . ) .",
    "three examples of large - amplitude , likely long - period variability are shown in fig .  9 , with a non - variable star for comparison .",
    "these variable stars have a period around 700 days and much redder colours than the bulk of the non - variable stars .",
    "a measure for the ampltidue of variability can be obtained by assuming a sinusoidal light - curve shape .",
    "the standard deviation of the unit sine function is 0.701 .",
    "hence , for a standard deviation in our data , @xmath70 , the amplitude estimate would be @xmath71 .    in practice , however , for small sets of data the standard deviation depends on the number of measurements .",
    "10 shows the result of simulations : it is clear that when only a handful of measurements are available , the standard deviation that is calculated will , on average , drop below the asymptotic value ( 0.701 for the sine function ) that is reached for well - sampled light - curves , as well as becoming less reliable .",
    "we set @xmath72 as a minimum for applying our method to estimate the amplitude from the standard deviation . from fig .",
    "10 one can see that , by then , the standard deviation will have converged to within 10% of the asymptotic value .",
    "the estimated k - band amplitude of variability is plotted _ vs. _  k - band magnitude in fig .",
    "variability could have been detected for @xmath73 mag .",
    "there is a clear tendency for the amplitude to diminish with increasing brightness , which is a known ( wood et al .",
    "1992 ; wood 1998 ; whitelock et al .",
    "2003 ) and to some extent understood ( van loon et al .",
    "2008 ) trend . among the variables with @xmath74 mag ,",
    "four have six or fewer measurements and their amplitudes are therefore unreliable  these are highlighted in fig .",
    "11 with crosses , and includes the one with the highest estimate for the amplitude . disregarding those , the amplitudes stay below @xmath75 mag and generally @xmath76 mag .",
    "very dusty agb stars are known to reach such large amplitudes ( wood et al .",
    "1992 ; wood 1998 ; whitelock et al .",
    "2003 ) , but they are very rare .",
    "light - curves of a few large - amplitude variables in our survey were displayed in fig .",
    "the estimated k - band amplitude of variability is plotted _ vs. _  the @xmath77 and @xmath78 colour in fig .",
    "there is a clear sequence branching off the bulk of stars towards redder colours and associated larger amplitudes ( cf .",
    "this is not surprising as large - amplitude variability is known to be associated with profuse dust formation ( wood et al .",
    "1992 ; wood 1998 ; whitelock et al .",
    "2003 ) , and the less - luminous larger - amplitude stars will be rendered obscured much more readily than their more luminous siblings ( van loon et al .",
    "1997 ) .    a small number of very large amplitude stars form a vertical sequence around @xmath79 and @xmath80 mag ( fig .",
    "12 ) , but these are suspect .",
    "we inspected all of the stars with @xmath81 mag by eye , and found that they fall into either of two categories : ( 1 ) nine bright stars , @xmath82 mag , that are affected by blending . in some frames",
    "these were mistaken for another faint star , resulting in a spuriously large amplitude .",
    "the small number of variable stars that are affected by such complications ( @xmath83% ) indicates that these are rare incidences ; ( 2 ) nine faint stars , @xmath84 mag , which were not visibly affected by blending .",
    "two of these in actual fact do have red colours , @xmath85 mag ( @xmath86 mag ) and @xmath87 mag ( @xmath88 mag ) , and they may be dusty large - amplitude variables .",
    "the same could explain the non - detection in the j- and h - band of four other stars in this category . that leaves three stars that appear blue for their large amplitude .",
    "these are located near the edge of the frame , resulting in particularly poor photometry on one or two occasions .",

    "the content is described in table 3 .",
    "it is composed of two parts , part i comprising the mean properties of the stars and part ii tabulating all the photometry ( for the benefit of generating lightcurves , for instance ) .",
    "the astrometric accuracy of the catalogue is @xmath92 r.m.s . , tied to the 2mass system .",
    "this accuracy was found to be consistent with the results from our cross - correlations with three other optical and ir catalogues ( cf .",

    "presents near - ir colour  magnitude diagrams for our field in m33 , with highlighted in green the variable stars we identified .",
    "large - amplitude variable stars are mainly found between @xmath6818 mag , and are conspicuously absent among fainter stars .",
    "some very bright variable stars are found , too .",
    "striking is the predominance of variable stars among the redder stars that lie to the right of the vertical sequence of the bulk of the stars .",
    "better quantified , albeit degenerate , are histograms of the distributions over brightness ( fig .",
    "14 ) and colour ( fig .",
    "15 ) . between @xmath6817 mag , and likewise for @xmath93 mag",
    ", the number of variable stars per histogram bin reaches the same value as the number of all ukirt sources per bin  note , however , that the bins in the former sample a three times larger range in brightness or colour , so the true fraction of variables among those stars is closer to a third .",
    "still , at @xmath94 mag or @xmath95 mag ( and with @xmath96 mag ) almost all stars are variable .    between @xmath2918 mag the fraction of variable stars drops to only a few per cent ; the frequency of stars increases but the frequency of variable stars decreases .",
    "this is due mainly to a combination of two factors .",
    "firstly , lower on the agb there is a greater contribution from stars that will still evolve to higher luminosity and lower temperature ( thus exacerbating the brightness increase in the k - band ) before they develop large - amplitude variability .",
    "that is precisely the reason why our project aims to use the variable stars as tracers of the distribution of stars over birth - mass .",
    "secondly , the relation between birth - mass and k - band brightness flattens dramatically for low - mass ( relatively faint ) agb stars .",
    "this is explored in much more detail in paper ii .",
    "to assess the level of contamination by foreground stars , we performed a simulation with the trilegal tool ( girardi et al .",
    "2005 ) . adopting default parameters for the structure of the galaxy , in a 0.005 deg@xmath1 field in the direction ( @xmath97 , @xmath98 ) only a small number of foreground stars",

    "these do not generally cause significant problems ",
    "they all have fairly neutral colours  except that very bright stars at @xmath99 mag are likely to be foreground stars and not stars within m33 . also indicated in fig .",

    "we characterise the stellar population in the central regions of m33 further by confrontation of the colour  magnitude diagrams with isochrones calculated by marigo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) ( figs .  17 and 18 ) .",
    "the isochrones were calculated for solar metallicity , which is appropriate for the central disc population in m33 ( cf .",
    "magrini et al .",
    "2007 ; rosolowsky & simon 2008 ) ; a check was made for a metallicity half that of the sun and no appreciable difference was found in the red ( super-)giant branches .",
    "the adopted distance modulus of @xmath10 mag appears to be appropriate as it fits well with the magnitude at which the variable stars become abundant and the k - band luminosity function shows a break in the slope ( fig .",
    "14 ) , at the location of the rgb tip , as well as to the maximum extent in luminosity of the rsgs .",
    "indeed , rsgs are found all the way until the earliest age ( highest birth mass ) at which they are expected , @xmath104 myr .",
    "the isochrones of marigo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) are the most realistic models easily available for comparison with dust - producing stellar populations , as they include predictions for the onset of large - amplitude pulsation , the associated mass - loss rate and dust - formation rate , and the resulting changes in the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) as the dust redistributes optical light over the ir domain .",
    "this causes the drastic excursions of the isochrones towards red colours as soon as the dust envelope becomes optically thick at near - ir wavelengths ; hence it is accompanied by a drop in k - band brightness as the peak of the sed shift towards ( even ) longer wavelengths .",
    "the 1-gyr isochrones show consistency with the red branch of ukirt variables .",
    "the 10-gyr isochrones seem to show a rather too rapid decline in the k band compared to observations , but this may be due to the fact that these stars experience very large reddening and thus become readily undetectable  this is corroborated by the isochrones as well as by empirical evidence of low - mass agb stars becoming obscured by circumstellar dust much more readily than their more massive siblings ( van loon et al .",

    "we also compare with the optical catalogue of rowe et al .",
    "( 2005 ) which includes narrow - band filters that they used to identify carbon stars .",
    "the matches were obtained by search iterations using growing search radii , in steps of @xmath105 out to @xmath106 , on a first - encountered first - associated basis after ordering the principal photometry in order of diminishing brightness ( k - band for the ukirt catalogue , i - band / i - band for the optical catalogues , and 3.6-@xmath107 m band for the _ spitzer _ catalogue ) .      the canada france hawaii telescope ( cfht ) optical variability survey ( hartman et al .",
    "2006 ) was performed during 27 nights ( comprising 36 individual measurements ) between august 2003 and january 2005 .",
    "the catalogue contains variable stars only , with photometry in the sloan g@xmath108- , r@xmath109- and i@xmath108-bands to a depth of approximately @xmath110 mag . out of 2 million point sources in a square - degree field",

    "1481 ( 85% ) were detected in our ukirt survey , of which 247 were found by us to be variable .",
    "the cfht variables that we did not identify as being variable are generally fainter than the rgb tip ( fig .",
    "19 ) and thus not the lpvs we aimed to find for the purpose of our project , but they also include bright agb stars and rsgs whose modest amplitudes ( especially at ir wavelengths ) may have led them to escape from our ukirt variability search .",
    "clearly , the dusty ( reddened ) agb variables detected in our ukirt survey were generally not detected in the cfht survey .",
    "the direct optical variability survey ( macri et al .",
    "2001 ) aimed to determine direct distances to m31 and m33 using detached eclipsing binaries and cepheid variables .",
    "the catalogue is based on observations performed between september 1996 and october 1997 , during 95 nights on the f.  l.  whipple observatory 1.2-m telescope and 36 nights on the michigan ",
    "mit 1.3-m telescope .",
    "the catalogue contains johnson b- and v- , and cousins i - band photometry for all stars with @xmath115 mag , and lists the v - band @xmath28 variability index ( cf .  section 4 ) .    within the coverage of our uist observations",

    "remarkably , most of the ukirt variables ( 87% ) were missed by the direct survey ( fig .",
    "this is due in part because the dusty variables are very faint in the optical , but surprisingly most of the not - so - dusty agb variables are also missing from the direct survey .",
    "the direct survey seems to have been less successful in finding lpvs than the cfht survey .",
    "rowe et al .",
    "( 2005 ) used the cfht and a four - filter system in 1999 and 2000 to cover most of m33 including the central region .",
    "the filter system was designed to identify carbon stars on the basis of their cyanide ( cn ) absorption as opposed to other red giants that display titanium - oxide ( tio ) absorption , using narrow - band filters centred on 8120 and 7777  , respectively .",
    "they added broad - band mould v- and i - band filters to aid in selecting cool stars .",
    "carbon stars in their scheme have [ cn]@xmath118[tio ] @xmath119 and @xmath120 mag , and m - type stars have [ cn]@xmath118[tio ] @xmath121 mag at the same v  i criterion ( they only considered stars for this purpose that had errors on these colours of @xmath122 mag ) .",
    "the region covered by our ukirt survey contains @xmath123100,000 stars from the rowe et al .",
    "catalogue ; all but 837 of our objects were identified among these .",
    "the problem with such density of optical sources is that chance co - incidences are common .",
    "when a pre - selection is made of stars that are probably carbon stars or m - type stars , which are likely to have been detected at near - ir wavelengths , then the number of stars to correlate with is drastically reduced .",
    "the average offsets between these and their identified ukirt counterparts are only @xmath124 in both ra and dec .",
    "the m - type stars follow the main giant branch ( fig .",
    "21 ) , avoiding the blue edge which is expected to be occupied by k - type giants without strong molecular absorption .",
    "the carbon stars are consistent with ages of @xmath125 gyr or a little younger , i.e.  birth masses around 23 m@xmath12 .",
    "two of the three carbon stars that are identified as ukirt variables show signs of reddening presumably due to circumstellar dust ; these are also among the brightest carbon stars and thus represent the termination point in their evolution .",
    "the faintest carbon stars are fainter than the tip of the rgb ; while unexpected for carbon stars formed by thermal pulses on the agb , faint carbon stars are known in other , generally metal - poor , populations , e.g. , in the sagittarius dwarf iregular galaxy ( gullieuszik et al .  2007 ) or in the galactic globular cluster @xmath126centauri ( van loon et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "a colour - colour representation is shown in fig .",
    "22 , where a crude distinction is made between rgb and agb stars .",
    "again , the reddened stars are agb stars ; rgb stars displaying a red j ",
    "k colour usually do not display a red h ",
    "k colour ( or _ vice versa _ ) , suggesting that they are not ( much ) affected by reddening but that photometric uncertainties become larger .",
    "the m - type and carbon stars from rowe et al .",
    "( 2005 ) are generally constrained to the agb , with a few carbon stars showing signs of reddening .",
    "though not many stars in rowe et al .",
    "have errors on their colours of @xmath122 mag , and the suspicion is that many more of the ukirt sources are carbon stars or m - type stars , carbon stars do not seem to dominate the stellar population in the central square kpc of m33 .",
    "this onfirms the trend of the ratio of carbon to m - type stars found by rowe et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to drop from typically @xmath127 to @xmath128 in the central few arcminutes , and it is corroborating evidence for a predominantly solar - metallicity population as carbon stars are more common among populations with sub - solar metallicity ( groenewegen 1999 ) .",
    "mcquinn et al .  (",
    "2007 ) used five epochs of _ spitzer _ space telescope observations of m33 obtained in the 3.6- , 4.5- and 8-@xmath107 m bands , to identify variable stars in a manner which is broadly similar to our approach with ukirt .    in the central regions of m33 ,",
    "crowding and strong , complex diffuse emission severely limited the capability of the _ spitzer _ survey .",
    "it yielded 784 sources in roughly the same area covered by our uist data . among these , 557 are in our photometric catalogue , most of them are brighter than the rgb tip . of the 227",
    "_ spitzer _ sources that we did not recover , 13 had been rejected from our catalogue because of too high @xmath19 values ",
    "these were at the edges of frames and only covered in part .",
    "hence the recovery rate is well above 70% .",
    "the success rate of the _ spitzer _ survey in detecting stars from our ukirt survey is particularly good for the rsgs , the brightest agb stars , and the dusty agb variables ( fig .",
    "23 ) ; agb stars not in the _ spitzer _ catalogue are generally situated closer to the centre of m33 where crowding increases . indeed , blending is quite common , with the _ spitzer _ source being centred in between the position of two similarly - bright stars .    the mid - ir colour  magnitude diagram ( fig .",
    "24 ) shows a well - populated , skewed sequence off from which a branch extends towards redder colour and fainter 3.6-@xmath107 m brightness .",
    "the latter is comprised of dust - enshrouded objects , among which a relatively greater proportion are ukirt variables .",
    "ukirt variables are also abound among the brightest 3.6-@xmath107 m sources in the diagram ; these are massive agb stars and rsgs .",
    "the confirmed m - type stars form a sequence of increasing 3.6-@xmath107 m brightness , and the only confirmed carbon star that is detected by _ spitzer _ ( and us ) sits roughly half - way and marginally to the red of that sequence .",
    "none of these are on the red branch of dust - enshrouded objects , probably because the optical photometry was not deep enough for them to have been detected or not accurate enough for them to have been classified .",
    "the isochrones confirm the picture just outlined in a qualitative manner , but there is a surprisingly large discrepancy between the _ spitzer _ photometry and the isochrones .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "photometry appears too blue at faint magnitudes , by at least several tenths of a magnitude  we consider it unlikely that the colours are really as negative as @xmath129-[4.5])\\approx-0.7 $ ] mag ( a factor two depression of the 4.5-@xmath107 m brightness ) .",
    "for the isochrones to match the 3.6-@xmath107 m brightness , in agreement with the way in which they match ( well ) the near - ir colour  magnitude diagrams , the isochrones would need to be shifted to higher 3.6-@xmath107 m brightness levels by at least a magnitude or the data need to be diminished by that amount .",
    "we find either solution unsatisfactory , and suspect that both the _ spitzer _ photometry and isochrones may need adjustments .",
    "we postpone a thorough investigation to paper iii in which we model the seds .",
    "ukirt was used to monitor the central @xmath0 ( square kpc ) of local group spiral galaxy m33 ( triangulum ) in the k - band filter with additional observations in the j- and h - band filters .    as a result ,",
    "a photometric catalogue was compiled of 18,398 stars among which 812 were identified as exhibiting large - amplitude variability .",
    "inspection of the lightcurves and locations on the colour  magnitude diagram with respect to theoretical models of stellar evolution leads us to conclude that most of these variable stars are agb stars or rsgs , and that most of the very dusty stars  that are heavily reddened even at ir wavelengths  are variable .",
    "our catalogue is cross - correlated with previous optical monitoring surveys , an optical carbon star survey , and the _ spitzer _ mid - ir survey .",
    "the ukirt catalogue is vastly more complete for the dusty variables than the optical surveys , but also much more complete than the _",
    "spitzer _ survey .",
    "our catalogue is made public at cds .    in the next papers in this series",
