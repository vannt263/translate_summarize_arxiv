    "many transcendental integrals such as @xmath18 and special functions that arise as solutions of odes have divergent asymptotic series as @xmath19 , roughly of the form @xmath20 , where the @xmath21 grow factorially . in @xmath0 , on the other hand , the same sums _ converge in a natural sense _ that we call _ absolute convergence in the sense of conway _",
    "( see  3 ) for all @xmath22 .",
    "part of the original motivation for developing surreal integration was the expectation of finding new and more powerful methods for solving such odes and summing such divergent series .",
    "there was initial success with the first part of the program when the square root , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 were extended to * no * in a property  preserving fashion @xcite by bach , norton , conway , kruskal and gonshor ( @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",

    "kruskal and norton , the functions as well as their integrals were intended to be genetically defined . at present , however , there is no adequate theory of genetic definitions in the literature , though @xcite and @xcite contain some useful preliminary remarks .",

    "indeed , in his recent survey @xcite , siegel characterizes the question of the existence of a reasonable definition of surreal integration as `` perhaps the most important open problem in the theory of surreal numbers '' .    despite being flawed , norton s integral is highly suggestive : indeed , for a fairly wide range of functions arising from applications , such as solving odes , we show that the use of inequalities coming from transseries and exponential asymptotics leads to a correct genetic integral . to prove the integral",

    "however , for more general functions , a substantial obstruction arises which involves considerations from the foundations of mathematics .",
    "in particular , we will show that , in a sense made precise , there is no description which , provably in @xmath25 , defines an integral ( of norton s type or otherwise ) from finite to the infinite domain , even on spaces of entire functions that rapidly decay towards @xmath26 .",
