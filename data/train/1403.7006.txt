    "the influence of a graded interface between materials has been already investigated by previous papers in the literature , @xcite where it was demonstrated that such an interface just leads to slightly larger confinement and excitonic energies , while their dependencies on external magnetic fields or wire dimensions remains essentially preserved . in this work",
    ", we will consider an abrupt interface between the core and shell layers .",
    "dielectric mismatch effects between materials are also neglected in our model .",
    "previous papers in the literature @xcite have demonstrated that these effects are described by potentials that are proportional to @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the dielectric constants of the hetero - structure materials , and are less important for large widths of the hetero - structure layers .",
    "the materials involved in the hetero - structures studied in this paper have aproximately the same dielectric constant , and the role of the dielectric mismatch effect due to the boundary between the outmost shell and the surrounding medium is ruled out by considering a large width of this shell , therefore , dielectric mismatch effects are negligible to a good approximation in our model .",
    "the heterostructure materials considered in this work have also similar lattice constants , so that strain effects does not play an important role as well .    in order to solve the schrdinger equation for the exciton @xmath22 ,",

    "a gauge invariant form of the finite differences scheme is applied to solve for the lowest energy states of this equation numerically , @xcite from where one obtains the carriers in - plane wavefunctions @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which are then integrated along with the coulomb term to form an effective potential for the problem in the @xmath4-direction , yielding @xmath32    we assume a gaussian wave function @xcite as the solution in @xmath4 @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the variational parameter that minimizes @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the hamiltonian in the @xmath4-direction ( see eq .",

    "the last integral is further calculated numerically , and the exciton energy is obtained by @xmath41 .",
    "we repeat the variational procedure for different combinations of electron and hole eigenstates and look for the combination of states that lead to the lowest exciton energy @xmath42 , which , as far as the variational method is concerned , represents an upper bound for the exciton ground state energy .",
    "notice that , rigorously speaking , the best approach to this problem would be not to separate the electron and hole variables , since eq .",
    "( [ eq2.1 ] ) is actually non - separable , because of the coulomb term .",
    "however , such an exact approach would lead to a five - dimensional problem ( two in - plane coordinates for each electron and hole and a relative @xmath4-coordinate for the exciton ) , which is computationally expensive . using the electron - hole states basis to construct a matrix that represents the hamiltonian and then diagonalizing it is not convenient as well , since each matrix element would consist of a five - dimensional integral , and there must be many of them for a properly accurate hamiltonian . as a matter of fact , these more accurate procedures were used in the literature mostly for circularly symmetric problems , where one can take advantage of the system symmetry to reduce the number of coordinates , or to ( semi-)analytically solve for the single - particle eigenstates .",
    "@xcite conversely , our case requires cartesian coordinates , which allows us to investigate elliptic shells , in - plane electric fields , and systems with arbitrary shell geometry , by paying the price of having more coordinates to deal with .",
    "thus , the main idea of the present model is to circumvent this problem by using a much simpler approach , which , in summary , consists in ( i ) assuming , as an approximation , that one can separate the variables , ( ii ) solving for the single - particles separately , and then ( iii ) minimizing the exciton energy as a whole by a variational procedure . due to its simplicity",
    ", this factorization of the wave function has been widely used in the literature , even in the case of degenerate single particle states , such as in ab oscillations .",
    "@xcite however , it is worthy to point out that in the degenerate case , this procedure leads to less accurate results , since it does not allow for an excitonic state consisting of an admixture of single - particle eigenstates .",
    "even so , we believe that , despite the model simplicity , the results obtained by the present approximation in the remainder of this paper are accurate enough , and a more sophisticated technique would require great efforts for just small quantitative corrections to the results .",

    "moreover , as we previously mentioned , the confined states in the circular case are similar to the in - plane states of circular quantum rings , where the influence of an in - plane electric field has already been extensively investigated by previous works in the literature . @xcite in the elliptic cms case , electric fields applied in different directions lead to qualitatively different behaviors of the energy states as a function of the electric field modulus , as illustrated in fig .",

    "more specifically , for a wire squeezed in the @xmath54-direction ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , when the electric field is applied in the @xmath57-direction ( @xmath58 ) , the ground state rapidly decreases with the field ( by roughly @xmath59 ) , while many crossings are observed between excited states as the field intensity increases , whereas for a field applied in the squeezing direction ( @xmath60 ) , the energies just decrease with the field , due to the quantum confined stark effect .",

    "interestingly enough , the ab effect is significantly enhanced as the eccentricity of the cms becomes lower than 1 .",
    "this effect comes from the fact that electron and hole wave functions are not completely overlapped in the elliptic cases shown : the integrated overlap between electron hole for each case were calculated as @xmath63 0.999 , 0.982 and 0.984 , for @xmath64 , 0.95 and 0.9 , respectively . in the circular case , there is no preferable confinement region along the shell , so that both the electron and hole are distributed equally along the whole gaas region and the net charge is neutral practically everywhere .",
    "the integrated overlap does not reach unity in this case just because their wavefunctions penetration in the barriers are slightly different .",
    "however , for a @xmath65 elliptic system , the carriers are pushed to the highest curvature regions , and in the proposed cms , heavy holes are pushed more strongly , due to their heavier mass as compared to that of the electron .",
    "being still not completely confined in the high curvature regions , the electron wavefunction covers a larger region as compared to the hole s wave function , then creating a wide region of suppressed overlap , namely , a non - neutral net charge . as a consequence , the ab effect is enhanced , as shown by the curve with circles in fig .",

    "the modulus of the binding energy is enhanced as the inner shell becomes elliptic , followed by the increase of the electron - hole ground ground state state overlap ( black squares ) .",
    "interestingly enough , the ( 0,1 ) overlap , between the ground state of the electron and the first excited state of the hole ( red triangles ) , is non - zero only for @xmath85 , suggesting that electron - hole transitions between these states are allowed only for higher values of eccentricity .",

    "thus , for @xmath92 , ( i ) the ( 0,0 ) overlap is non - zero , but it is also lower than 1 , because the hole state is entirely confined in the inner shell , whereas the electron state spreads on both shells ; ( ii ) the ( 0,1 ) overlap is non - zero , since both states have the same angular symmetry , and differ only by their charge distributions over the inner and outer shells ; and ( iii ) the ( 1,0 ) and ( 1,1 ) overlaps are zero , since the first excited state of the electron has a different angular symmetry , as compared to both states of the hole .",

    "the exciton energy exhibits oscillations as a function of the magnetic field , which is reminiscent of the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect , usually observed in quantum rings .    in the case of two concentric confining shells ,",
    "we demonstrate that the barrier between the shells plays an important role on the definition of the symmetry of the electron and hole eigenfunctions . in specific cases ,",
    "it is possible to observe for one carrier , a ground state wave function that spreads over both shells and a first excited state with non - zero angular momentum , whereas for the other carrier , each eigenstates is confined in a single shell and both have zero angular momentum .",
    "this has a drastic effect not only on the behavior of the energy spectrum of each carrier under an external magnetic field , but also on the transition probabilities between electron and hole states .",
    "however , considering an elliptic inner shell , even for eccentricities as small as @xmath65 , the electron and hole states become more similar , as both are confined in the higher curvature regions . in this case ,",
    "ab oscillations of the carriers energies are more clear , and overlaps between their ground states wave functions are enhanced . besides , due to the strong confinement of electrons and holes in these higher curvature regions , the exciton binding energy becomes less susceptible to external magnetic fields .",
    "therefore , the inter - shell barrier is demonstrated to be a useful parameter to tune the allowance of transitions between electrons and hole states in the circular case , whereas the eccentricity of the inner ring can be used to push electron and hole wave functions to the same confinement regions , smoothening out the dependence of the exciton binding energy on the external magnetic field .",
