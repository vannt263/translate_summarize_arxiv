    "we have retrieved these data from the archive and reduced them with the standard midas pipeline .",
    "the data from 2004 and subsequent epochs include fibers from the star and a thar reference spectrum allowing for wavelength stabilization .",

    "both feros and harps are wavelength - stabilized spectrographs with excellent rv stability over time , with internal errors much smaller than the published rvs of possible standards observed by feros on the same nights as the v343 nor data .",
    "so rather than convert the feros relative rvs to absolute rvs by comparing to standards , we instead convert these to absolute rvs on the same scale as the harps data by assigning an initial rv offset , and then fitting for this offset more precisely in the mcmc orbit fitting procedure ( as described in section  [ sec : orbit ] ) .",
    "the initial offset is chosen by assuming that the rv measured by feros on 2005 march 23 is identical to the rv measured from the 2005 april 01 harps epoch .",

    "period ( @xmath63 ) is then derived from semimajor axis and total mass using kepler s third law and the distance to the system , and primary mass ( @xmath66 ) from the difference between total mass and secondary mass .",
    "we have found this choice of fit and derived parameters leads to faster convergence , and has a more natural set of priors .",

    "we confirm the orbital period and eccentricity reported by @xcite based only on rv data , a significant subset of which appears within this analysis .",
    "the orbit is somewhat inclined ( @xmath74 ) and eccentric ( @xmath75 ) , with a well - defined period of @xmath76 yrs ( @xmath77 days ) .",
    "the relative dearth of astrometric data means the fractional error on semimajor axis is significantly larger than the error on the period , so the total mass , and thus the primary mass , is only constrained at the 9% level : @xmath78  @xmath13 .",
    "the precise rv observations , however , allow us to constrain the secondary mass to 6% : @xmath79  @xmath13 .",
    "the system rv of @xmath80 km  s@xmath42 is a significant improvement over the value of @xmath81 km  s@xmath42 used in @xcite . despite being over 2@xmath82 from the initial value ,",
    "the updated _ uvw _ velocity of the v343 nor system still places it solidly in the @xmath0 pic moving group .",
    "we find a new _ uvw _ of the v343  nor system of @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85  km  s@xmath42 , within 1-@xmath82 of the @xcite @xmath0  pic moving group values of @xmath86 $ ]  km  s@xmath42 , as expected for a group member .      with direct measurements of the mass of both v343  nor  aa and ab , _ jhk _ photometry , and an age for the system of @xmath10  myr @xcite , we can test the accuracy of theoretical stellar models with our observations of the system .",
    "we begin with the 2mass combined photometry of the system @xcite , the _ hipparcos _ distance to v343 nor aa @xcite , and our measured contrasts between the two stars . utilizing the associated error with each quantity we use monte carlo error analysis to derive errors on apparent and absolute resolved magnitudes while accounting for the correlated errors . in figure  [ fig : model ] we plot the absolute _ jhk _ magnitudes and dynamical masses against isochrones of the siess @xcite , bhac15 @xcite ,",
    "yonsei - yale ( y@xmath87 , @xcite ) , and padova parsec @xcite model grids . detailed discussion of the differences and similarities between these model grids , including comparison to a larger sample of benchmark stars , is presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in addition , we include photometry and dynamical masses of gj 3305 @xcite the only other resolved spectroscopic binary within the @xmath0  pic moving group .",
    "for all four objects the 1@xmath82 errors lie between the 20 and 30 myr isochrones , showing good agreement between the theoretical predictions and the measurements in the nir for the expected age of the @xmath0 pic moving group , over almost a factor of 4 in mass .",
    "we proceed to derive model - dependent ages for the @xmath0  pic moving group based on these four members with dynamical masses .",
    "we use a similar bayesian method as in @xcite to construct posterior probability distributions for age .",
    "we construct a three - dimensional grid uniformly sampled in distance and mass and logarithmically sampled in age .",
    "each point in the grid contains _ jhk _ apparent magnitudes by linearly interpolating the isochrones .",
    "we then compute @xmath73 given the measured photometry and errors in each band , and likelihood is taken as @xmath88 , as we assume gaussian errors .",
    "priors are flat in linear age ( given a uniform star formation rate ) , and gaussians in parallax and mass , corresponding to the measurements and 1@xmath82 uncertainties . final age posterior probability density functions ( pdfs ) are computed by marginalizing over mass and distance , and are plotted in figure  [ fig : model2 ]    for the m stars , gj 3305 a and b and v343 nor ab , the nir fluxes from the isochrones are monotonically decreasing with age over the initial tens of myr , leading to well - defined peaks in probability between 10 and 40 myr ( figure  [ fig : model2 ] ) . a prior that is uniform in age assigns a probability of an age between 1 and 10 gyr that is 100 times larger than for an age between 1 and 100 myr . as a result ,",
    "even though the photometry of gj  3305  a and b is most consistent with a @xmath120  myr age , there is a slight rise in probability for these two stars at several gyr since the high - mass end of the 1-@xmath82 confidence intervals reaches close to the main sequence . for the solar - mass star v343 nor aa the 1-@xmath82 errors in mass are consistent with the zero age main sequence ( zams ) , so an age of several gyr is preferred as this is where solar - type stars stay for the majority of their lives .",
    "however , the age posteriors show an increase in probability at @xmath120 myr reflecting the temporary increase in luminosity during the pre - main sequence evolution expected as the core becomes radiative and core nuclear burning begins , but before the core expands and the luminosity decreases toward the zams .    in order to produce model - dependent ages of the @xmath0 pic moving group we treat the four stars as independent measurements of the age , and multiply the posterior pdfs together .",
    "the pdfs are not truly independent given the covariances between the binaries in mass , nir fluxes , and distance , however given the similarity in the location of the probability peaks this should be a minor effect .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : model3 ] contains the product of the pdfs for only the m stars , showing generally similar pdfs for each of the four models , with ages ranging from @xmath89  myr for the y@xmath87 models to @xmath90  myr for the bhac15 models .",
    "ages are generally older than the @xmath10 myr derived by @xcite , but overall consistent .",
    "the bottom panel includes v343 nor aa as well , where the models treatment of the onset of a radiative , nuclear - burning core and the subsequent rise in luminosity adds additional constraints on the age . in general the widths of the posteriors shrinks upon using all four stars , and most models move toward a younger age , with the different models producing ages from @xmath91  myr for the padova models to @xmath92  myr for the y@xmath87 models .",
    "the padova models show good agreement with the age determination of @xcite , while the other three models are at higher ages , but consistent at the @xmath11-@xmath82 level .",
    "pic moving group derived from the three m stars ( top ) and from all four stars including v343 nor aa ( bottom ) .",
    "the pdfs show well - constrained ages , and are consistent with the @xmath10  myr age for the moving group as a whole derived by @xcite , indicated by a vertical line and gray region for the 1-@xmath82 uncertainty . by combining all the pdfs together we reach a final age for the @xmath0 pic moving group of @xmath5  myr . ]    to compute a final age for the @xmath0 pic moving group based on both sets of binaries with astrometric masses we average the four model - dependent posterior pdfs .",
    "this gives each set of isochrones equal weight , and partially accounts for both the measurement error and the systematic error of the different models .",
    "our final age determination of the @xmath0 pic moving group based on these dynamical masses is then 26@xmath933 myr .",
    "our age of @xmath5  myr is slightly older than the @xmath10  myr age of @xcite , which is derived from isochrone fitting to all the stars in the group , but within 1-@xmath82 uncertainties the two ages are consistent with each other .",
    "while the differences between the models continues to be the primary source of uncertainty in these ages , more precise measurements of the photometry of the components of v343 nor a , as well as more constrained masses for all objects , will improve the precision of the age determinations for each individual model .",
    "much of the uncertainty in the mass of v343 nor aa comes from the uncertainty in the orbital semimajor axis ( as seen in the strong covariance between the two in figure  [ fig : orbit ] ) , so future astrometric monitoring of the orbit over the next 12 years will be necessary to reduce these mass uncertainties .",
    "ages for the @xmath0 pic moving group have been derived through a number of different methods , each converging on similar values in recent years .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite utilized the lithium depletion boundary to derive ages of @xmath8 myr , @xmath5  myr , and @xmath9  myr respectively .",
    "@xcite find a consistent traceback age for the system , but with large uncertainties , and an isochronal age of @xmath94  myr .",
    "the most recent contribution by @xcite updates the isochronal age to @xmath10  myr .",
    "@xcite found an age for gj 3305 of @xmath11  myr from a bayesian analysis of the dynamical masses and resolved and integrated photometry of the system ( we find similar results when using the bcah15 models and only gj 3305 ab @xmath95 photometry , deriving an age of 32@xmath936  myr ) .",
    "our age of @xmath5  myr , based on isochrone fitting only to stellar members with dynamical masses , is well within the ranges of these measurements , and gives further weight to a @xmath125  myr age of the @xmath0  pic moving group .",
    "@xcite use the spatial extent of the @xmath0 pic moving group to estimate a time scale of star formation across the group of @xmath15 myr , similar in scale to the uncertainty we and other authors present .",
    "a direct measurement of the age dispersion in the group will likely require a higher degree of age precision for individual stars than can currently be reached .",
    "the masses of the directly imaged planets 51 eri b and @xmath0 pic b are largely unchanged if we adopt this new age . using the bt - settl models with the @xcite solar abundances ( @xcite , allard et al .",
    "2016 in prep ) we compute masses by linearly interpolating the grid for absolute @xmath23 magnitude only .",
    "errors are computed using a monte carlo procedure taking into account errors in age and absolute @xmath23 . when moving from @xmath9  myr of @xcite to the @xmath5  myr",
    "used here ( and using the @xcite value for @xmath23 magnitude ) the mass of 51  eri  b increases from @xmath96  @xmath97 to @xmath98  @xmath97 . for @xmath0  pic  b , when using the @xmath23 magnitude and age of @xmath8  myr from @xcite , the mass increases from @xmath99  @xmath97 to @xmath100  @xmath97",
    "we have presented new imaging observations of v343 nor a , as well as archival imaging of the pair and rvs of the primary , which taken together allow for a precise determination of the orbit .",
    "our orbit fit shows well - defined orbital parameters , including dynamical masses of @xmath78  @xmath13 and @xmath101  @xmath13 for the two components .",
    "the v343 nor a system thus joins gj 3305 as only the second resolved spectroscopic binary with dynamical masses in the @xmath0 pic moving group that can serve as a benchmark for testing models of pre - main sequence evolution .",
    "future astrometric monitoring of this system will further improve the mass precision and thus the precision of the model - dependent age of the @xmath0 pic moving group . at present",
    "there is no astrometric measurement of the system when the projected separation drops below 60 mas .",
    "observations in 2017 , when the projected separation should be between 20 and 40 mas , will be especially helpful in improving the precision of the mass measurements",
    ". such close separations should be reachable with non redundant masking ( nrm ) observations , and is an ideal target for gpi nrm @xcite .",
    "2017 will also see the rapid decrease in rv from 6 to -2  km  s@xmath42 , a poorly sampled part of the rv phase curve .",
    "this system also makes an excellent target for nir spectroscopic observations to detect the spectral lines of the secondary , making the system a double - lined spectroscopic binary .",
    "such measurements would further constrain the orbital parameters , specifically the mass ratio of the system ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "overall there is excellent agreement between the age of the @xmath0 pic moving group , as derived from isochrone fitting to all the stars @xcite , the theoretical models , and the dynamical masses and nir photometry of these objects spanning a factor of @xmath14 in stellar mass .",
    "identification and monitoring of new resolved @xmath0 pic moving group binaries with short enough orbital periods to provide dynamical masses on reasonable timescales can further test the reliability of the models relations between mass , age , and photometry .",
