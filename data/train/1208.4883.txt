    "<S> finally the system enters the incompressible mott phase when the gap opens . at the same time , multiple occupation of lattice sites becomes energetically unfavorable and suppressed in the mott regime . </S>",
    "<S> more quantitatively , fraction of atoms in doubly occupied lattice sites ( double occupancy ) is closely related to the compressibility @xmath25 evaluated at the trap center @xcite . besides these common features of a mott insulator </S>",
    "<S> , it is especially important to clarify the difference between the behaviors of mott insulators with su(2 ) and su(@xmath0 ) symmetries .    here , </S>",
    "<S> we report a successful formation of the su(@xmath26 ) symmetric mott insulator state with an six - spin component atomic fermi gas of @xmath1yb in a three - dimensional optical lattice . from double occupancy measurements with photoassociation spectroscopy and lattice modulation spectroscopy </S>",
    "<S> , we confirm the above characteristics of the mott state . </S>",
    "<S> precise control of the spin degrees of freedom provided by optical pumping enables us a straightforward comparison between the cases of su(6 ) and su(2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find an important difference that a lower temperature is obtained for su(6 ) mott insulator as the consequence of larger entropy carried by isolated spin @xcite ( see also discussions in section [ section_dpr ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , at the lowest temperature achieved , the entropy density at the center of the trap reaches @xmath27 , which originates from spin degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> our experimental results are in good agreement with a theoretical calculation based on a high - temperature series expansion ( htse ) which is reliable in the parameter regime of the current experiment @xcite and a local density approximation ( lda ) accompanied with continuum approximation to take into account the presence of the harmonic confinement ( see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> this work is an important first step and opens the door to the new frontier of the study of strongly correlated phases of the su(@xmath0 ) system .    </S>",
    "<S> experimental procedure is as follows ( see also methods for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sample is prepared by loading evaporatively cooled fermi gas of @xmath1yb into the optical lattices with simple cubic geometry . the initial temperature before loading to the lattice is around 20% of the fermi temperature @xmath28 . in the following sections , we specify the initial condition in terms of corresponding entropy per particle @xmath29 , in the unit of the boltzmann constant @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> double occupancy is measured using photoassociation ( pa ) technique @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the mott phase with unit filling , namely one atom per lattice site , and average density at the trap center is below 2 for all experiments presented here . in this case , we can neglect multiple occupation @xmath31 and double occupancy is simply related to the atom loss @xmath32 induced by pa , as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the total atom number without pa . </S>"
