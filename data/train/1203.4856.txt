    "the generalized seniority  @xcite or broken pair  @xcite framework provides an approximation ( or truncation ) scheme for nuclear shell model calculations . if strong pairing correlations are present , the generalized seniority scheme can represent these correlations in a space of greatly reduced dimensionality relative to the full shell model space .",
    "the approach also serves as the basis for mappings from the shell model to bosonic collective models  @xcite .",
    "the underlying premise of generalized seniority is that the ground state of an even - even nucleus can be well approximated by a condensate built from _ collective _ @xmath2 pairs , which are defined as a specific linear combination of pairs of nucleons in the different valence orbitals , each pair coupled to angular momentum zero .",
    "( the conventional seniority approach , in contrast , considers pairs within the different orbitals separately and does not directly address the correlations between orbitals  @xcite . ) for a certain very restricted class of interactions  @xcite , generalized seniority describes an exact scheme for obtaining certain states : the @xmath3 ground state is exactly of the @xmath2 condensate form , and the first @xmath4 state involves exactly one broken @xmath2 pair .",
    "however , for generic interactions , the generalized seniority approach ( or , equivalently in this context , the broken pair approach ) constitutes a truncation scheme for the shell model space , in which the ground state and low - lying states are represented in terms of a condensate of collective @xmath2 pairs together with a small number @xmath5 ( the _ generalized seniority _ ) of nucleons not forming part of an @xmath2 pair .",
    "the generalized seniority scheme is closely related to the bcs scheme with quasiparticle excitations : the @xmath2 condensate has the same form as a number - projected bcs ground state , and the model space with generalized seniority @xmath5 is identical to the space of number - projected bcs @xmath5-quasiparticle states  @xcite .",
    "the essential difference is that in the generalized seniority scheme diagonalization is carried out on states of definite nucleon number , that is , after projection rather than before projection .",
    "although the generalized seniority approach has long been applied in various contexts ( _ e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , it has not been systematically benchmarked against calculations carried out in the full shell model space .",
    "only recently have limited comparisons been made , for certain even - mass light @xmath6 isotopes  @xcite and even - mass light @xmath0 isotopes  @xcite . otherwise , extensive previous studies with generalized seniority bases , as reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite , have instead compared the generalized seniority results with experiment .",
    "such comparisons do not disentangle the question of how accurately the truncated calculation approximates the full - space calculation from the largely unrelated question of how physically appropriate the assumed interaction and model space are for description of the particular set of experimental data .",
    "these comparisons were also mostly based on schematic interactions , _",
    "e.g. _ , pairing plus quadrupole , phenomenologically adjusted to a small set of experimental observables .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to establish a benchmark comparison of the results obtained in a generalized seniority truncated model space against those obtained in the full shell model space , for a full major shell and with realistic interactions .",
    "in particular , we consider the @xmath0 isotopes ( @xmath7@xmath8 ) , in the @xmath9-shell model space , with the fpd6  @xcite and gxpf1  @xcite interactions .",
    "both even - mass and odd - mass isotopes are considered , with generalized seniority @xmath10 , that is , at most one broken @xmath2 pair .",
    "truncation of the model space according to the generalized seniority drastically reduces the dimensionality of the shell model space .",
    "the full system of valence nucleons is effectively replaced by a much smaller system , consisting of just the unpaired nucleons , either @xmath11 or @xmath12 in the present calculations .",
    "shell model calculations in the full valence space are now well within computational reach  @xcite for semimagic nuclei .",
    "therefore , for semimagic nuclei , the immediate implications of the generalized seniority scheme are _ conceptual _ , that is , to the interpretation of the shell model results in terms of collective pairs , and therefore also indirectly to assessing the plausibility of generalized seniority as the basis for boson mapping , rather than to extending _ computational _ capabilities . however , if one moves away from semimagic nuclei , to nuclei which simultaneously have large numbers of valence protons and neutrons , full shell model calculations are still computationally prohibitive . generalized seniority might therefore be of direct computational value in making calculations for these nuclei tractable , provided that the seniority - violating nature of the proton - neutron interaction  @xcite does not necessitate an impractically large number of broken pairs for an accurate description of these nuclei .    the construction of the generalized seniority basis and other technical aspects of the calculational method are outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec - methods ] .",
    "the calculations for the @xmath0 isotopes in the generalized seniority scheme are then described ( sec .",

    "let @xmath13 be the creation operator for a particle in the shell model orbital @xmath14 , with angular momentum projection quantum number @xmath15 .",
    "the angular - momentum coupled pair creation operator is then @xmath16 for a pair of angular momentum @xmath17 .",
    "here we follow standard angular momentum coupling notation for spherical tensors .",
    "the collective @xmath2 pair of the generalized seniority scheme is defined by @xmath18 where @xmath19 runs over the active orbitals , and @xmath20 .",
    "this operator creates a linear combination of pairs in different orbitals @xmath19 , with respective amplitudes @xmath21 .",

    "the number @xmath5 is the _ generalized seniority _ of the state . in the present calculations , we consider semimagic nuclei",
    ", so only like valence particles ( here , all neutrons ) are present .",
    "however , it should be noted that a generalized seniority basis can be defined equally well for nuclei with valence particles of both types via a proton - neutron scheme , that is , by taking all possible products of proton and neutron generalized seniority states with generalized seniorities @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",

    "a different such state is obtained for each choice of valence orbital @xmath19 for the added nucleon , and the resulting state has angular momentum @xmath38 . in the context of bcs theory ,",
    "these states are number - projected one - quasiparticle states  @xcite .",

    "must be constructed , and matrix elements of the hamiltonian must be obtained with respect to this basis .",
    "the states used just above to define the generalized seniority model space are not normalized .",

    "the two - neutron separation energy [ @xmath106 , shown in fig .  [ fig - ca - even - energy](c , d ) , reveals finer details , in particular differences between the _ interactions _ ( comparing the two panels ) , but the generalized seniority and full shell model results are still largely indistinguishable at this scale .",
    "a distinctive feature of generalized seniority as an _ exact _ symmetry , in the sense of talmi  @xcite , is that the ground state energies vary quadratically across the shell , and the separation energies are therefore strictly linear in @xmath104 , insensitive to any subshell closures  @xcite .",
    "however , as observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , when generalized seniority is simply used as a variational approach , there is no such constraint , and it is possible to obtain subshell effects .",

    "this difference may be considered as the missing correlation energy , not accounted for in the @xmath2-pair condensate description of the ground state . by the variational principle , the quantity @xmath108 must be nonnegative , since the @xmath32 space is a subspace of the full model space .",
    "the residual vanishes where the @xmath32 and full calculations are equivalent , at @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( see sec .",
