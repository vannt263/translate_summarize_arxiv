    "loop formation in polymers is essentially a many body problem as a polymer is made of many connected segments and hence an exact analytical solution is impossible .",
    "all the theories of loop closing dynamics are approximate @xcite .",
    "although many theoretical and simulation attempts have been made to investigate the effect of flexibility @xcite , solvent quality @xcite on the loop closing dynamics , not much theoretical investigation has been performed to shed light on the effects of hydrodynamic interaction on loop closing dynamics other than the renormalization group calculation by freidman et al @xcite .",

    "we investigate the effect of hydrodynamic interaction on the ring closing dynamics of a flexible chain in @xmath1 solvent .",
    "it is well known that the ring closing time ( @xmath4 ) for a flexible chain without excluded volume and hydrodynamic interaction ( rouse chain @xcite ) scales with the chain length ( @xmath5 ) as @xmath6 in the wilemski - fixman ( wf ) @xcite theoretical framework .",
    "here we use zimm model doibook for the polymer which actually takes care of the hydrodynamic interaction at the simplest possible level .",
    "our calculation shows that hydrodynamic interaction profoundly affect the rate of loop formation and also has a different scaling relation with the length of the polymer @xmath5 . the rest of the paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",

    "the expression for this loop closing time reads    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the sink - sink correlation function defined as    @xmath23    in the above expression @xmath24 is the greens function or the conditional probability that a chain with end - to - end distance @xmath25 at time @xmath26 has the end - to - end distance @xmath27 at time @xmath12 ; @xmath28 is the equilibrium distribution of the end to end distance since the chain was in equilibrium at time @xmath26 .",

    "we calculate the looping time given by the above expression for a flexible polymer in presence and absence of hydrodynamic interaction and make a comparative study . throughout the paper",
    "it is assumed that the chain was in equilibrium at @xmath26 and only at @xmath41 the hydrodynamic interaction is turned on ( for the zimm chain ) .",
    "thus the equilibrium end - to - end distribution for the rouse as well as for the zimm chain is given by ( eq.([peq ] ) ) .",
    "the last integration over time is not analytical so has to be carried out numerically .",
    "the simplest dynamical description of a flexible chain or polymer in solution is given by rouse model @xcite .",
    "this model does not take into account of excluded volume and hydrodynamic interaction and has been the basis of dynamics of dilute polymer solution and has been successfully used in the context of ring closing in polymers sebastianjcp , breathing dynamics in dna @xcite , polymer translocation @xcite etc . in the continuum limit the governing equation of motion for the position vector @xmath42",
    "is given by    @xmath43    here @xmath15 is a continuous variable , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the length of a monomer in the discrete representation of the rouse polymer and @xmath46 is the random force with the moments    @xmath47    it is straightforward to show that the rouse normal modes ( @xmath48 ) obey the following equation    @xmath49    where @xmath50 , @xmath51 for @xmath52 and @xmath53 for @xmath52 . here",
    "@xmath54 is the random force satisfying @xmath55 and @xmath56 .    then for a rouse",
    "polymer it can be shown that the normalized end - to - end vector time correlation function defined in ( [ phi ] ) is given by    @xmath57    where @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the simplest possible model for the dynamics of a flexible chain with the hydrodynamic interaction but without the excluded volume interaction is known as the zimm model @xcite . in @xmath1 condition",
    "the continuum limit equation of motion for the position vector @xmath42 in the zimm model is given by    @xmath60    here @xmath61 is the mobility matrix and is generally a nonlinear function of @xmath62 and the above equation is quite difficult to handle . to simplify this analysis zimm introduced a pre - averaging approximation , which replaces @xmath61 by its equilibrium average , @xmath63 .",
    "it can be shown that with this pre - averaging approximation @xcite becomes a linear function of @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath65    where @xmath66 decreases slowly as @xmath67 .",
    "thus in zimm model interaction among the segments is not localized .",
    "this is how a zimm chain in different from a rouse chain .",
    "it is possible to show @xcite that for the zimm chain in @xmath1 solvent , the normal modes ( @xmath68 ) can be shown to obey an equation which has the same structure as the rouse normal modes    @xmath69    where @xmath70 for @xmath52 and @xmath53 for @xmath52 . here @xmath54 is the random force satisfying @xmath55 and @xmath56 .    in case of @xmath1 solvent condition",
    "the normalized end - to end vector time correlation function ( eq.([phi ] ) ) for the zimm chain is given by    @xmath71    where @xmath72 and @xmath73 .    in principle",
    "it is straightforward to calculate the closing time with a delta function sink ( eq.([taudelta ] ) ) as it involves evaluating @xmath40 and carrying out an integration over time .",
    "we evaluate @xmath40 for both the cases exactly by carrying out the sums defined in ( eq.([phi_rouse ] ) ) and ( eq.([phi_zimm ] ) ) .",
    "the closing time ( @xmath4 ) with the radial delta function sink is calculated for the rouse chain as well as for the zimm chain in @xmath1 solvent .",
    "calculation of @xmath4 involves evaluating @xmath40 for the respective chains and then putting it in eq .",
    "( [ taudelta ] ) followed by an integration over time which has to be carried out numerically . the end - to - end vector correlation function defined in eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) is actually a sum over the decays of all the odd modes and at a given time @xmath12 the bulk of the contribution to @xmath40 comes from the lower normal modes .",
    "each normal mode decays with an effective rate constant , @xmath74 for the rouse chain ( eq.([phi_rouse ] ) ) and in case of a zimm chain in @xmath1 solvent it is @xmath75 ( eq.([phi_zimm ] ) ) .",
    "now had it been @xmath76 all the odd modes of the rouse chain hence the end - to - end vector correlation function would have decayed faster resulting a faster ring closure compared to that for a zimm chain in @xmath1 solvent . in reality @xmath77 and the ratio @xmath78 has a strong length ( @xmath5 ) dependence , @xmath79 .",
    "only when , @xmath80 the normal modes of the zimm chain in @xmath1 solvent decay faster . for a very short chain or in case of higher normal modes the condition @xmath81 can be achieved and then only the normal modes for the zimm chain ( in @xmath1 solvent ) will decay slowly compared to the normal modes of the rouse chain .",
    "thus for a short zimm chain ( in @xmath1 solvent ) initial decay of @xmath40 is slow compared to a rouse chain .",
    "this is shown in the inset of fig . 1 .",
    "on the other hand for a long zimm chain all the normal modes decay faster than the rouse chain normal modes .",
    "this naturally results a slowly decaying @xmath40 for a rouse chain as is shown in fig .",
    "2 .    in fig .",
    "3 log - log plot of the closing time ( @xmath4 ) is plotted against the chain length @xmath5 for both the chains .",
    "the slope for the rouse chain has been found out to be @xmath82 very close to previously found values based on wf theory calculation @xcite .",
    "for the zimm chain ( in @xmath1 solvent ) the slope is @xmath83 .",
    "thus hydrodynamic interaction makes ring closure faster . also notice for a very short chain the ring closure is faster for a rouse chain as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "this actually suggests that the proportionality factor or the frequency factor between the ring closing rate , @xmath4 and @xmath84 , where @xmath85 with the hydrodynamic interaction on and @xmath86 without the hydrodynamic interaction , too has a length ( @xmath5 ) dependence .",
    "in this paper we show that the hydrodynamic interaction makes ring closure faster within wf @xcite framework if the chain is not very short . for a very short chain ring closure can be slower in presence of hydrodynamic interaction . the ring closing time ( @xmath4 ) for the zimm chain ( in @xmath1 solvent ) scales as @xmath3 .",
    "this is actually in very good agreement with the renormalization group calculation prediction of friedman et al .",
    "they showed that for a zimm chain not too short the closing time scales as @xmath87 . but",
    "surprisingly @xmath87 behavior can also be seen even without hydrodynamic interaction .",
    "for example , harmonic chain approximation within wf framework leads to similar scaling @xcite .",
    "also in the model of szabo , schulten and schulten ( sss ) @xcite , in which the difficult problem of the polymeric chain having many degrees of freedom is replaced with a single particle diffusing in a potential of mean force predicts @xmath87 scaling for a chain without hydrodynamic interaction .",
    "portman @xcite pointed out that sss theory @xcite actually gives a lower bound to the chain closing time and wf theory @xcite gives an upper bound .",
    "so a faster ring closure in sss formalism as compared to wf theory prediction is expected .",
    "experimentally the closure rate @xmath88 for a @xmath89 residue polypeptides of the alanine - gylcine - glutamine trimer have been found out to be vary as @xmath90 for large @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "although in accordance with sss theory @xcite , this faster ring closing as compared to a flexible chain without hydrodynamic interaction might also be due to hydrodynamic interaction as found in our theoretical analysis here .",
    "thus just by looking at the length dependence of the ring closing time it is rather impossible to comment on the microscopic basis of ring closure .",
    "similar scalings can arise due to completely different reasons . as a future problem it will be interesting to see what happens to the closing time for a chain with hydrodynamic interaction as different sink functions are used and also in the sss formalism @xcite .",
    "it is expected since the sss formalism gives a lower bound to the ring closing rate @xcite , ring closing with the hydrodynamic interaction work in the sss framework will make ring closing even faster as compared to in the wf framework .",
