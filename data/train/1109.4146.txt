    "dwarf galaxies , being some of the earliest collapsed structures in @xmath13cdm and hence representing potential building blocks of larger galaxies , have come to the forefront of studies of galactic evolution in recent years .",
    "the more than doubling of known local group dwarfs since the release of sdss @xcite has provided many more dwarfs in varying environmental situations to study . despite most dwarfs being gas deficient within @xmath0  kpc of the galaxy",
    "@xcite they all show signs of ancient star formation potentially explaining this depletion of gas @xcite . however , in addition to these ancient stellar populations many of these dwarfs around the galaxy and within the local group show signs of distinct populations of younger stars arising from multiple starbursts separated by gigayears @xcite .",
    "for example , fornax dwarf galaxy contains stars younger than @xmath14  gyr @xcite .",
    "paradoxically , there is little , if any , trace of molecular or atomic hydrogen to provide a sufficient reservoir of cool gas to enable the onset of star burst activities ( fornax shows only an off center cloud which may be galactic gas , carina with similar bursts shows no gas ; * ? ? ?",
    "these bursts of star formation are together responsible for , on average , @xmath15 of the star formation within a dwarf @xcite and may last for a period of time of order the dynamical time of the system @xcite .",
    "the length and timing of these bursts have a large variation between dwarfs with some only experiencing one early burst of star formation , to carina - like dwarfs with several distinct periods of star formation @xcite , to those that have continuous star formation with several to no small bursts @xcite .",
    "stars formed over several generations also appear to have diverse heavy element abundance .",
    "the stellar metallicity distribution in many dwarfs is consistent with that expected from self contamination by early generations of massive stars , albeit with a substantial loss of supernova ejecta @xcite . in isolated dwarfs far from a massive spiral or elliptical galaxy",
    ", these bursts may be a consequence of gas being blown out and subsequently infalling with a time period of several gigayears @xcite .",
    "episodic star formation in these isolated dwarfs require the gas that is blown out to remain bound .",
    "otherwise if the dwarf is orbiting a host system , the gas could easily be blown outside of the roche sphere to fall onto the host galaxy .",
    "although radiatively driven outflow and tidal disruption may account for the lack of gas in these dwarf galaxies today , they also highlight the difficulties in gas retention and self contamination .    here",
    "we present a simple self - consistent model that may explain not only star bursts in non - isolated environments but also the lack of neutral gas in the dwarf galaxies around the galaxy .",
    "we suggest gas is expelled after a star burst and subsequently reaccreted by its original host dwarf galaxies .",
    "this reaccretion process only occurs at the apogalacticon and any expelled gas that is not shielded from stripping by the dwarf is lost to the host .",
    "for a dwarf galaxy to successfully accrete gas at apogalacticon , the gas must stay within the dwarfs gravitational influence for a sufficiently long time to be allowed to cool and collapse before the tidal forces and ionizing radiation field are felt as the dwarf approaches perigalacticon .",
    "the roche sphere is the volume of space around the dwarf within which the dwarfs gravitational pull exceeds that of the galaxy . at any point along the orbit the radius of the instantaneous roche sphere is given by @xcite @xmath16^{1/3},\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the radius of the roche sphere , @xmath18 the gravitational constant , @xmath19 the mass of the dwarf , @xmath20 the angular velocity , @xmath21 the potential of the galaxy and @xmath22 the galactocentric radius .    at perigalacticon and apogalacticon in a keplerian orbit",

    "this increase in the roche sphere , shown schematically in figure [ fig : roche ] , allows gas that is unbound at perigalacticon to be nominally bound at apogalacticon ( assuming the momentum of the gas carries it through to apogalacticon ) .",
    "this gas is both compressed by the orbital path ( by a factor of @xmath28/[1-\\epsilon]$ ] ) and experiences a weaker radiation field far out from the galactic center .",
    "these factors allow the gas to cool and fall into the potential well of the dwarf triggering a starburst .",
    "kpc and eccentricity of @xmath29 .",
    "the dwarf is represented by a solid circle in between two ( smaller ) solid circles representing gas clouds .",
    "the roche sphere for a @xmath30  @xmath31 dwarf around a @xmath32  @xmath31 galaxy is shown as a circle surrounding the dwarf at apogalacticon and at the mid - way point . at the perigalacticon",
    "the roche sphere is shown as a white circle inside the point representing the dwarf galaxy .",
    "the roche sphere changes from being able to encapsulate points at @xmath33  myr along the orbit to being an order of magnitude too small at perigalacticon .",
    "the orbital compression is visible by the changing spacing along the orbit , a consequence of kepler s second law .",
    "[ fig : roche],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in order to participate in reaccretion , gas that is blown out must first survive an orbit of the galaxy .",
    "this gas , which is likely to form small clouds once removed from the dwarf @xcite , must survive the combination of high velocities and a strong radiation field at perigalacticon . for a cloud of gas with uniform density in hydrostatic equilibrium that is located directly behind the dwarf to survive an orbit with the same velocity as it began it must have an average distance , @xmath34 , behind the dwarf of @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the radius of the cloud , @xmath19 and @xmath26 are the masses of the dwarf and galaxy respectively , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the temperatures of the halo and cloud respectively and @xmath39 is the coefficient of drag of the cloud ( @xmath2@xmath14 ) . assuming that the mass ratio of the dwarf to the galaxy is not too large , this value is comparable to the roche sphere at perigalacticon .",
    "however , material off center may have to be much closer to the dwarf to experience the same level of protection from drag .",
    "the radius of survival will be increased by the dwarf s supersonic movement through the hot halo , and by a turbulent wake created by warm and hot gas that is removed from the dwarf .",
    "these factors result in a much lower free - stream velocity @xcite , and subsequently lower drag , behind the dwarf for gas clouds that have been expelled by the dwarf .",
    "as trailing gas clouds rely on both the shock generated by the dwarf and the turbulent wake created by dwarfs passage , a column of protection is formed behind the dwarf approximately the size of the roche sphere dissipating at large distances .",
    "gas clouds located in front of the dwarf will be slowed by drag until they are recaptured by the dwarf or they sink into the galactic potential well . as gas clouds must be within the roche sphere of the dwarf in order to be captured , a similar column of ` protection ' ( although in this case , a column of recapture ) is located ahead of the dwarf .",
    "we therefore approximate the amount of material that is captured by the dwarf or survives an orbit as the amount of gas inside a column of radius equal to the roche sphere at perigalacticon and extending along the orbital path of the dwarf .",
    "due to the vigorous star formation taking place throughout a burst we assume that all gas within the dwarf becomes ionized and is expelled from the centre .",
    "this gas , having been heated by the burst of star formation , will expand spherically and is assumed to be constant density . as this sphere",
    "would be confined by the pressure of the hot halo , we further assume that the density of the sphere at burst @xmath40 is the same as the density at the previous burst , @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath42 . the growing hot galactic halo and the infusion of metals into the expelled gas after each burst may alter this assumption slightly .",
    "if the mass present in the last burst was @xmath43 then the sphere of gas post burst has a radius of @xmath44^{1/3}$ ] , where @xmath45 is the mass of a hydrogen atom and @xmath46 the density of hydrogen . as the post - burst density of gas in this sphere is constant the only time this sphere can exceed the roche sphere at apogalacticon is after the initial period of star formation , i.e. @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "not all gas that fills this sphere will end up being redistributed after the next starburst .",
    "in addition to gas lost to stripping , some gas will also be consumed in the starburst ending up as the constituent stars .",
    "we assume the gas that ends up as stars to be approximately the mass in the roche sphere at perigalacticon .",
    "the gas that occupies the roche sphere at perigalacticon may also be providing low level star formation throughout the orbit .",
    "this mass , chosen for analytic convenience , is  for most orbits  similar to the mass that would be consumed in a typical starburst given the gas consumption timescales and burst lengths @xcite .",
    "the radius in the warm sphere post burst is then @xmath49^{1/3 } , \\label{eq : eq5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the volume of the roche sphere at perigalacticon is altered by a factor of @xmath50 to account for the difference in volume between a sphere and cylinder as @xmath51 .",
    "as this gas is expelled from the dwarf by the starburst , it will quickly be heated to a warm phase of around @xmath52  k. this gas will be moving through an isothermal exponential hot halo of gas with a hydrogen density ( @xmath46 ) of @xmath53  @xmath54 at @xmath55  kpc consistent with @xcite .",
    "the gas is assumed to consist of small clouds in hydrostatic equilibrium with a hot halo .",
    "the mean density of hydrogen around the dwarf galaxy is assumed to be @xmath56  @xmath54 .",
    "this density corresponds a filling factor of @xmath2@xmath57% for the gas clouds at galactocentric distances of @xmath58  kpc .",
    "such gas would be easy to see in absorption through qso sight lines but unable to be seen in emission .    in order for these small gas clouds to participate in the next starburst",
    "it must first fall back into the central gravitational potential and cool into a neutral cold phase . for a low metallicity gas , @xmath59fe@xmath60h@xmath61=0.1 $ ] , at these densities",
    "the cooling timescale is @xmath62  myr @xcite .",
    "the cooling time will be slightly larger than the values given here due to the need to radiate energy gained from the collapse and the heating effect of the radiation fields .",
    "the timescale of infall can be over an order of magnitude larger , @xmath63  myr .",
    "this infall timescale is comparable to the timescale of a typical burst of a few hundred megayears @xcite and may influence how long the burst occurs for .",
    "both these timescales however , are much shorter than the orbital timescale of a few gigayear which determines how rapidly the roche sphere changes .",
    "this short timescale for cooling can only occur at apogalacticon . at perigalacticon",
    "the gas will be extended along the orbital path according to kepler s second law , lowering its density by a factor of @xmath64 and hence increasing its cooling time by a factor of @xmath65 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "in addition , the gas experiences a much stronger radiation field which will counteract any cooling and reassociation taking place , leaving most gas ionized until apogalacticon .    gas that has cooled and fell into the potential well of the dwarf may still be prevented from triggering another burst if it is kept ionized by the radiation field of the galaxy .",
    "as star formation requires optically thick gas to occur , all ionizing photons from the galactic field are assumed to be absorbed , with the galactic field dropping off as an inverse square law , with the ( opacity corrected ) photon flux given by @xcite @xmath66    in addition to this galactic radiation field , the dwarf will also experience the extragalactic uv background .",
    "we use the time varying extragalactic uv field derived by @xcite , with the absorption of this radiation is done according to the prescription in @xcite with a constant density neutral core surrounded by an ionized medium of equal density .",
    "the timing of apogalacticons  and consequently bursts in this model  is determined by the orbital properties of the dwarf .",
    "two models are investigated , that of a simple keplerian system described by equations ( [ eq : rperi ] ) and ( [ eq : rapo ] ) and one of a point mass dwarf orbiting inside a growing einasto halo .",
    "both systems consist a dwarf with a point mass @xmath67  @xmath31 , a value consistent with the virial mass of a dwarf that formed at @xmath68 and possesses a dynamical mass similar to that observed in dwarf galaxies today within @xmath69  pc of the dwarf s center @xcite .",
    "each dwarf has an initial gas mass of @xmath70  @xmath31 , giving the dwarf an approximately cosmological baryon to dark matter ratio .    inside the keplerian system the dwarfs orbit a host galaxy of mass @xmath71  @xmath31 .",
    "this mass is roughly half that of the virial mass of the milky way , but is consistent with the mass of the halo within @xmath72  kpc that reaches the same virial mass at the milky way derived from the rave survey @xcite .",
    "these dwarf galaxies begin at apogalacticon @xmath73  gyr ago , and experience a burst at every future apogalacticon",
    ".    for dwarfs inside a growing einasto halo , a @xmath74 virial mass of @xmath75  @xmath31 is assumed , consistent with the circular velocity from the rave survey .",
    "the mass of this halo is calculated backward in time by assuming the median rate of growth for milky way size dark matter halos within the millennium - ii simulation @xcite .",
    "dwarf galaxies inside the growing einasto halo are assumed to be just past perigalacticon today and traced back in time @xmath57  gyr .",
    "the choice to calculate the orbit backwards from a beginning point  as opposed to the more realistic case of beginning at apogalacticon as in the keplerian case  was taken to ensure a broad range of present day perigalacticons and eccentricities can be easily calculated as both of these quantities are not conserved in a growing halo .",
    "as orbits changed substantially due to the galaxy growth in mass between @xmath76@xmath57  gyr ago , orbits which have a perigalacticon during this time period , which was likely to be much larger than the perigalacticon today , were unlikely to have experienced any burst in this model with effected dwarfs behaving much more like isolated dwarfs .",
    "the choice of tracing orbits back from perigalacticon was done to minimise the occurrence of this timing of perigalacticons with minimal differences otherwise .",
    "orbits which still had a perigalacticon here were calculated from a point up to @xmath12 further along its orbit in order to see if most dwarfs of that perigalacticon and eccentricity combination would have experienced bursts .    the amount of neutral gas available to fuel star formation as a function of perigalacticon and eccentricity is calculated from applying the time - varying galactic and extragalactic radiation fields to the total mass of gas at any given apogalacticon given by equation ( [ eq : eq5 ] ) .",
    "many dwarfs are able to experience at least one burst subsequent to initial star formation , the mass available in the keplerian system is shown in figure [ fig : b1 ] , with dwarfs on approximately circular orbits far away experiencing the biggest bursts , a consequence of their large perigalacticon roche sphere protecting much more gas from stripping . assuming that the halo mass of the galaxy , the star formation rate in the galaxy and the extragalactic uv background are constant into the future , the amount of gas available at a future burst is also able to be easily calculated .",
