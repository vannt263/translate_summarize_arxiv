    "why is the higgs boson important ? the higgs field couples to all the particles in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the higgs field obtains the vacuum expectation values ( vev ) @xmath0 by electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , triggered by some unknown dynamics .",
    "the weak gauge bosons become massive due to the consequence of the higgs mechanism .",
    "all the quarks and the charged leptons get masses via the yukawa interactions by the replacement of the higgs field by @xmath0 . even neutrinos ( although it is the physics beyond the sm ) can have their tiny masses through dimension five operators or neutrino yulawa couplings after the higgs boson obtains @xmath0 .",
    "the higgs field is indeed the origin of mass .",
    "it is also known that the higgs field is necessary to stabilize the unitarity of partial wave amplitudes of elastic scatterings of longitudinally polarized weak bosons such as @xmath1 at high energies . without the higgs field",
    "the s - wave amplitude @xmath2 blows up at high energies @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the fermi constant and @xmath5 is the collision energy , and the unitarity is broken at a tev scale .",
    "the introduction of the higgs field cancels such a behavior , and @xmath6 is a constant at high energies ; @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the mass of the higgs boson .",
    "therefore , the higgs field is necessary to save the unitarity .",
    "a condition that the perturbative calculation does not break unitarity gives the upper bound such as @xmath9 tev  @xcite .",
    "there is no theoretical principle to determine the structure of the higgs sector within the sm .",
    "one isospin doublet scalar field @xmath10 is simply introduced as the minimum form in the sm . under the renormalizability",
    ", its potential can be uniquely written as @xmath11 by putting an assumption of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the shape of the potential becomes like a mexican hut , and the electroweak symmetry is spontaneously broken at the vacuum @xmath14 , where @xmath15 gev .",
    "consequently , all sm particles but photons and gluons obtain masses from the unique vev @xmath0 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : c - m ] , the universal relation between couplings and masses is shown .",
    "the sm gives a simple description for ewsb .",
    "however , the following questions come soon .",
    "why is it the miminal form ?",
    "how we obtain @xmath16 ? what is the origin of the higgs force @xmath17 ?",
    "now that a higgs boson has been found with the mass of about 125 gev , the time has come to consider these questions more seriously .",
    "as there is no principle in the sm higgs sector , there are many possibilities for non - minimal higgs sectors .",
    "notice that while the current lhc data do not contradict the predictions in the sm , most of the extended higgs sectors can also satisfy current data as well .",
    "these extended higgs sectors are sometimes introduced to give sources to solve the problems beyond the sm such as baryogenesis , dark matter and tiny neutrino masses .",
    "each scenario does have a specific higgs sector .",
    "it is also well known that the introduction of the elementary scalar field is problematic , predicting the quadratic divergence in the radiative correction to the mass .",
    "such quadratic divergence causes the hierarchy problem .",
    "there have been many scenarios proposed to solve this problem such as supersymmetry , dynamical symmetry breaking , extra dimensions and so on .",
    "many of the models based on these new paradigms predict specific higgs sectors in their low energy effective theories .    therefore , to determine the higgs sector by experiments is essentially important not only to clarify the mechanism of ewsb but also as a window to new physics beyond the sm .",
    "the discovery of the 125 gev higgs boson at the lhc is surely a great step for determination of the structure of the higgs sector . from the detailed study of the higgs sector",
    ", we can determine the model of new physics .",
    "what kind of extended higgs sectors we can consider ? as the sm higgs sector does not contradict the current data within the errors , we may think that there is at least one isospin doublet field .",
    "an extended higgs sector can contain additional isospin multiplets to the doublet of the sm . in principle",
    ", there can be infinite kinds of extended higgs sectors . as a simple example",
    ", we may consider models with one additional singlet field , one additional doublet field , one additional triplet field and so on .",
    "these extended higgs sectors can receive constraints from the current data of many experiments including those for the electroweak rho parameter and for flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) .",
    "the rho parameter for a higgs sector with @xmath18 multiplets is given at the tree level by @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) are isospin and hyper charges of the @xmath23-th multiplet ( @xmath24 ) , and @xmath25 for real fields ( @xmath26 ) and @xmath27 for completx fields .",
    "the data shows @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "it is found that higgs sectors with additional doublets @xmath29 ( and singlets ) predict @xmath30 at the tree level , like the sm higgs sector .",
    "hence , multi - doublet extensions would be regarded as natural extensions . on the other hand",
    ", the introduction of higher representation fields except for the septet field causes deviations in the rho parameter from unity at the tree level .",
    "for example , in the model with a triplet field @xmath31(@xmath32 ) with the vev @xmath33 , @xmath34 is given , so that a tuning @xmath35 is required to satisfy the data .",
    "thus such models are relatively exotic .",
    "it is well known that the multi - higgs structure receives a severe constraint from the results of fcnc experiments .",
    "fcnc processes such as @xmath36 and @xmath37 are strongly suppressed  @xcite . in the sm with a doublet higgs field , the suppression of fcnc processes",
    "is perfectly explained by the gim mechanism  @xcite . in multi higgs doublet models",
    "where multiple higgs doublets couple to one quark or charged lepton , higgs boson mediated fcnc can easily occur . in order to avoid fcnc",
    ", it is required that higgs bosons have different quantum numbers  @xcite .    .",
    "four types of yukawa interaction in the 2hdm . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "let us discuss the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) with @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the minimal extension with multi - doublet structure . for avoiding fcnc , a softly - broken discrete symmetry under @xmath40 and @xmath41",
    "is imposed  @xcite .",
    "the higgs potential is then given by @xmath42 the doublet fields are parameterized as @xmath43 where vacuum expectation values @xmath44 and @xmath45 are expressed by @xmath0 ( @xmath46 gev ) and @xmath47 by @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the mass matrix of the cp - even scalars is diagonalized by introducing the mixing angle @xmath50 , and two mass eigenstates @xmath51 and @xmath52 are obtained .",

    "the effective lagrangian is @xmath62 another case is @xmath63 . in the limit where the @xmath64 coupling takes the same value as the sm prediction @xmath65 , all the yukawa couplings with @xmath51 takes the sm values , and @xmath66 is negligible . in this case",
    ", @xmath51 behaves as the sm - like higgs boson .",
    "when @xmath67 is slightly smaller than unity , the couplings @xmath68 ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) , @xmath71 ( @xmath72,@xmath73,@xmath74 , @xmath75 ) deviate from the sm predictions depending on type of yukawa interaction . by detecting the pattern of the deviation in each higgs boson coupling , we can distinguish the type of yukawa coupling in the 2hdms .",
    "in 2015 , the lhc experiment will restart with the highest energy 14 tev .",
