    "x - ray reflection off the surface of cold disks in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and galactic black holes ( gbhs ) has been an active field of research since the work of @xcite . in early studies ,",
    "the illuminated material was assumed to be cold and non - ionized @xcite .",
    "it was soon realized , however , that photoionization of the disk can have a great impact on both the reflected continuum and the iron fluorescence lines .",
    "detailed calculations were then carried out by @xcite and @xcite . however , in all of these papers , the density of the illuminated material was assumed to be constant along the vertical direction .",
    "this assumption applies only to the simplest version of radiation - dominated shakura - sunyaev disks @xcite , and only for the portion where viscous dissipation is the dominating heating process . for the surface layers ,",
    "however , photoionization and compton scattering are the major heating sources .",
    "therefore the approximation of constant density is not appropriate .",
    "moreover , thermal instability allows the coexistence of gas at different phases .",
    "these different phases have very different temperatures , and hence different densities to keep the gas in pressure balance .",
    "recently @xcite relaxed the simplifying assumption of constant gas density .",
    "they determined the gas density from hydrostatic balance solved simultaneously with ionization balance and radiative transfer .",
    "they made an important observation that the thomson depth of the hot coronal layer can have great influence on the x - ray reprocessing produced by the deeper , and much cooler disk . in order to simplify the calculation of the vertical structure , though , they ignored thermal conduction and the effects of transition layers between the different stable phases .",
    "a discontinuous change in temperature was allowed whenever an unstable phase was encountered .",
    "they argued that such transition layers are of little importance because their thomson depths are negligibly small .",
    "however , without taking into account the role of thermal conduction , their method of connecting two different stable layers is rather _",
    "ad hoc_. moreover , even though the thomson depths of these transition layers are small , it does not guarantee that the x - ray emission and reflection from such layers are negligible .",
    "because the temperature regime where the transition layers exist is not encountered in the stable phases , some of the most important lines can have appreciable emissivity only in these layers .",
    "also , since resonance line scattering has much larger cross section than thomson scattering , the optical depths in resonance lines can be significant .    including thermal conduction in the self - consistent solution of the vertical structure presents a serious numerical challenge .",
    "the difficulties are due to the coupling between hydrostatic balance , radiative transfer and heat conduction .",
    "@xcite first studied the phase equilibrium of a gas heated by cosmic rays and cooled by radiation .",
    "they found that taking into account heat conduction in the boundary layer allows one to obtain a unique solution of the stable equilibrium .",
    "@xcite calculated the full temperature profile for a compton - heated corona , and @xcite calculated the static conditions of the plasma for different forms of heating and cooling .",
    "but they did not include much discussion of the spectroscopic signatures resulting from the derived vertical structure .    in this paper",
    ", we first calculate the temperature structure in the layers above the accretion disk , then calculate the emission lines via radiative recombination ( rr ) and reflection due to resonance line scattering from the derived layers .",
    "certain illuminating continua spectra allow more than two stable phases to coexist , with two transition layers connected by an intermediate stable layer .",
    "for the transition layer , since the thomson depth is small , the ionizing continuum can be treated as constant ; and since its geometric thickness is smaller than the pressure scale height , the pressure can be treated as constant as well .",
    "we can thus obtain semi - analytic solution of the temperature profile by taking into account thermal conduction . for the intermediate stable layer ,",
    "its thickness is determined by the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium . in our model",
    ", the normally incident continuum has a power - law spectrum with an energy index of @xmath0 .",
    "we also assume a plane - parallel geometry and that the resonance line scattering is isotropic .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in  [ sec_structure ] we discuss the existence of the thermal instability and compute the thermal ionization structure of the transition layers ; in  [ sec_spectrum ] we calculate the recombination emission lines and the reflection due to resonance line scattering ; in  [ sec_summary ] we summarize the important points of the calculations , the validity of various approximations made in the calculations , and the detectability of the recombination emission and reflection lines .",
    "the vertical structure of an x - ray illuminated disk at rest is governed by the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium and of energy conservation @xmath1 in the first equation , @xmath2 is the force density due to gravity and radiation pressure .",
    "the dependence of the force on the plasma density is included explicitly through the hydrogen density @xmath3 . in the second equation ,",
    "a time independent state is assumed , @xmath4 is the thermal conductivity , and @xmath5 is the net heating rate depending on the gas state and the incident flux @xmath6 ( differential in energy ) .",
    "we neglect the effects of magnetic field and adopt the spitzer conductivity appropriate for a fully ionized plasma , @xmath7 erg @xmath8 s@xmath9 k@xmath9 @xcite . we have used the classical heat flux , @xmath10 , in equation ( [ eq_transition ] ) because the electron mean free path is short compared to the temperature height scale .",
    "since the continuum flux may change along the vertical height , in principle , the above two equations must be supplemented by an equation for radiative transfer .",
    "a self - consistent solution of such equations is difficult to obtain . in the following ,",
    "we invoke a few physically motivated approximations , which make the problem tractable .",
    "first , in thermally stable regions , the gas temperature is slowly varying , the heat conduction term in the energy balance equation can be neglected .",
    "therefore , the temperature can be determined locally with the condition @xmath11 .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the dependence of @xmath12 on the gas pressure @xmath13 and the illuminating continuum @xmath6 can be expressed in the form of @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the electron density , @xmath16 is the net cooling rate per unit volume , and @xmath17 is an ionization parameter defined by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the total flux of the continuum , and @xmath20 is the speed of light . in figure [ fig_scurve ] , we show the local energy equilibrium curve @xmath21 versus @xmath17 , at @xmath22 calculated with the photoionization code xstar @xcite .",
    "these curves are commonly referred to as `` s curves '' due to their appearance .",
    "the illuminating continuum is assumed to be a power law with energy index @xmath0 .",
    "the solid line labeled with `` s - curve 1 '' corresponds to a low energy cutoff at 1 ev and a high energy cutoff at 150 kev , while the dashed line `` s - curve 2 '' corresponds to a high energy cutoff at 200 kev .",
    "the choice of such incident spectra is based on their common appearance in many agns and gbhcs .",
    "the region is thermally `` unstable '' where the `` s - curve '' has a negative slope , and `` stable '' where the slope is positive , as indicated in figure [ fig_scurve ] . in the thermally unstable regions , we have @xmath23 where the derivative is taken while the energy balance is satisfied , i.e. , @xmath24 .",
    "this condition was shown @xcite to be equivalent to the instability condition discovered by @xcite @xmath25        the thermal instability allows the gas to coexist at different phases .",
    "the gas temperature may change by orders of magnitude over a geometric thin region whenever an unstable phase separates two stable ones .",
    "this results in enormous temperature gradients and heat conduction .",
    "therefore the heat conduction in the energy balance equation should be included in such transition layers between stable phases .",
    "on the other hand , the thicknesses of these transition layers are usually smaller than the pressure scale height , so one can safely treat the gas pressure as constant in these regions . moreover , the continuum radiative transfer can be neglected because the compton optical depth is found to be small .",
    "the vertical structure of the transition regions is then solely determined by the energy balance equation with heat conduction .",
    "the thomson optical depth @xmath26 of such regions is readily estimated by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the thomson scattering cross section .",
    "the transition layer solution is not arbitrary under the steady - state conditions , i.e. , where there is no mass exchange between the two stable phases which the transition layer connects .",
    "a similar problem in the context of interstellar gas heated by cosmic rays was well studied by @xcite .",
    "we follow their procedure here and define @xmath29 , in order to rewrite equation ( [ eq_transition ] ) in the form : @xmath30 a steady - state requires vanishing heat flux at both boundaries of the transition layer , or @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the temperatures of the two stable phases which are connected by a transition layer .",
    "this condition determines a unique ionization parameter @xmath17 for the transition layer in question , and the integration of equation ( [ eq_dy2 ] ) along the vertical height gives the detailed temperature profile as a function of optical depth .",
    "if the disk does not realize the steady - state solution , there are additional enthalpy terms in equation ( [ eq_transition ] ) which require that there be mass flow through the transition region ",
    "i.e. the cool material in the disk evaporates , or the hot material in the corona condenses @xcite .",
    "physically , this corresponds to a movement of the transition layer up or down through the vertical disk structure .",
    "however , since the density increases monotonically toward the center of the disk , this `` motion '' stops where the transition layer reaches the steady state value of @xmath17 .",
    "thus , in the absence of disk winds or continuous condensation from a disk corona , the steady state solution should generally be obtained .",
    "there is a complication for the `` s - curves '' shown in figure [ fig_scurve ] , because in each curve there exist two unstable regions and therefore there should be two transition layers . for `` s curve 1 '' ,",
    "condition [ eq_y2 ] can be met for both transition layers with resulting ionization parameters @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are associated with the transition layer which connects to the lowest temperature phase and highest temperature phase , respectively . for `` s curve 2 ''",
    ", the resulting ionization parameters for two transition layers , however , satisfy @xmath37 .",
    "such a situation is unphysical , where the ionization parameter of the upper transition layer is smaller than that of the lower one , because in the context of accretion disks , the upper layer receives more ionizing flux and has lower pressure .",
    "so in practice , for `` s curve 2 '' the intermediate stable region is skipped and a transition layer connects the lowest temperature phase to the highest temperature phase directly .",
    "the ionization parameter of this transition layer is determined the same way by applying equation ( [ eq_y2 ] ) .",
    "there is then an intermediate stable layer , of nearly uniform temperature , in between these two transition layers for `` s curve 1 '' , as indicated with bc in figure [ fig_scurve ] .",
    "the thickness of the intermediate layer should in principle be obtained by solving the coupled equations of hydrostatic equilibrium , energy balance , and radiative transfer . however , unlike the stable phase at the disk base or that of the corona , which may be compton thick , this intermediate stable layer is generally optically thin , because its optical depth is restricted by the difference between @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "furthermore , the temperature in this layer is slowly varying , and therefore heat conduction can be neglected .",
    "we shall make another approximation that the variation of the force density @xmath2 in the hydrostatic equation can also be neglected .",
    "this may not be a good approximation .",
    "however , since our main purpose is to investigate qualitatively the effects of an intermediate stable layer , such a simplifying procedure does capture the proper scaling relations of the problem , and has the advantage of less specific model dependence .",
    "writing equation ( [ eq_hydro ] ) in a dimensionless form and parameterizing the force factor by a dimensionless parameter @xmath38 , we obtain @xmath39 the parameter a defined here is identical to the gravity parameter in @xcite in the absence of radiation pressure .",
    "the integration of this equation from @xmath35 to @xmath36 gives the thomson depth of the intermediate stable layer .",
    "assuming radiation pressure can be neglected , the force factor at a given radius @xmath40 of the disk can be estimated as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the luminosity of the continuum source in units of the eddington limit , @xmath43 is the half thickness of the disk at radius @xmath40 , @xmath44 is the mass of the central source , @xmath45 is the proton mass , and @xmath46 is the eddington luminosity . in this estimate , we have assumed that @xmath47 .",
    "this gives @xmath48 the value : @xmath49 for a typical thin disk , as those present in agn and black hole binaries , one expects @xmath50 . if the luminosity is sub eddington , @xmath51 as in most agns , @xmath48 is of order unity .",
    "however , since the disk surface may not be normal to the continuum radiation , @xmath19 may be only a fraction of the value assumed above , which increases @xmath48 by one or two orders of magnitude .",
    "on the other hand , as the source approaches the eddington limit , @xmath48 may become smaller than 1 .",
    "therefore , we expect @xmath48 to be in the range of 0.1  10 . the exceptional cases of much smaller and larger @xmath48 are discussed in ",
    "[ sec_summary ] .",
    "the temperature profiles and optical depths of the transition layers and possible intermediate stable layer are shown in figures [ fig_transition ] .",
    "three labeled curves in solid lines correspond to `` s - curve 1 '' ( in figure [ fig_scurve ] ) with different values of the force factors @xmath48 = 10 , 1 , and 0.1 , respectively .",
    "the dashed curve corresponds to `` s - curve 2 '' , where there is no intermediate stable layer .",
    "for each of the solid curves , three layers are clearly seen , with two transition layers being connected by an intermediate stable layer , as illustrated for the case of @xmath52 .",
    "the smaller @xmath48 produces a more extended intermediate stable layer as expected .",
    "because the stable phase with the lowest temperature is almost neutral , and the stable phase at the highest temperature is almost fully ionized , they are not efficient in generating x - ray line emission , except for iron fluorescence lines from the neutral material . only the transition layers and the intermediate stable layer are expected to emit discrete lines in the soft x - ray band . in a photoionized plasma ,",
    "the temperature is too low for collisional excitation to be an important line formation process .",
    "instead , radiative recombination ( rr ) followed by cascades dominates the line emission .",
    "the flux of a particular line can be written as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the density of the ion before recombination , @xmath55 is the line energy , and @xmath56 is the line emissivity defined as in @xcite .    in ionization equilibrium where the ionization rate is equal to the recombination rate , we have @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the recombination coefficient of ion @xmath59 , @xmath60 is the number density of ion @xmath61 , @xmath6 is again the monochromatic incident flux ( differential in energy ) , and @xmath62 is the photoionization cross section of ion @xmath61 . defining the branching ratio @xmath63 , equation ( [ flux_emission ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the fractional abundance of ion @xmath61 with respect to the electron density .",
    "as indicated , @xmath66 and @xmath67 depend only on temperature @xmath21 and ionization parameter @xmath17 , which are both functions of optical depth @xmath68 . for convenience",
    ", we further define the `` emission equivalent width '' @xmath69 .",
    "then if @xmath70 , which depends only on the shape of the incident continuum , @xmath71 can be written as : @xmath72    therefore the emission equivalent width @xmath71 is independent of the density of the medium and the incident flux .",
    "it is a unique function of the structure deduced in section [ sec_structure ] .",
    "all other variables depend only on @xmath21 and @xmath17 .",
    "the numerical values of @xmath73 were provided by d. liedahl ( private communication ) , and were calculated using the models described in @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath74 were computed using xstar @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig_emission ] , we plot the spectra of the recombination emission within the 0.5  1.5 kev band with a spectral resolution @xmath75 ev , which is close to the spectral resolution of the grating spectrometers on _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_. the top panel corresponds to the case without an intermediate stable layer , and the bottom panels corresponds to the case with an intermediate layer for @xmath76 and 0.1 , respectively . for clarity , from top to bottom ,",
    "the flux in each panel is multiplied by a factor indicated in each panel .",
    "it appears that the existence of an intermediate stable layer enhances the emission in this energy band .",
    "this is not surprising since the ions that are responsible for these lines have peak abundances at temperatures close to that of the intermediate stable layer . in all cases ,",
    "the equivalent widths ( ews ) of the emission lines are less than 1.0 ev , with respect to the ionizing continuum .",
    "the strongest lines are the hydrogen - like and helium - like lines of oxygen , with ews approaching several tenths of an ev .",
    "hydrogen - like and helium - like lines from iron outside the plotted energy band are somewhat stronger , with ews reaching a few ev . we note that our low equivalent width values conflicts with those derived by @xcite , who found some lines with equivalent widths as high as 30 ev .",
    "however , since they did not consider the appropriate locations for the transition regions in @xmath17-space , their intermediate stable layer subtended a much larger optical depth than we find here .",
    "naturally with a thicker layer , they found larger equivalent widths .",
    "emission from rr is not the only line formation process in the transition layers and the intermediate stable layer . due to very large cross sections in resonance line scattering , the reflected flux in these lines",
    "may be significant . with the computed thermal and ionization structure ,",
    "the column density in each ion and the optical depth in all resonance lines can be calculated straightforwardly .",
    "the cross sections for resonance line scattering depend on the line broadening .",
    "we assume thermal doppler effects as the only mechanism .",
    "although the gas temperature is a function of depth , we calculate the line width for a temperature where the abundance of each ion peaks as an average , and assume that the resonance scattering cross sections are uniform along the vertical direction . in terms of absorption oscillator strength @xmath77",
    ", this cross section of the resonance line scattering @xmath78 can be written as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the electron mass , @xmath81 is the electron charge , @xmath82 is the wavelength of the line and @xmath83 is the average line width in wavelength . under the assumption of thermal doppler broadening , @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the temperature at which the ion abundance peaks , and @xmath86 is the ion mass . the resonance scattering optical depth @xmath87 for a line from ion @xmath59 can be estimated as @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the column density of the ion .    the radiative transfer in the line is a complicated issue @xcite .",
    "a full treatment is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "however , since we are only interested in a reasonable estimate of the reflected line flux , a simple approach may be adopted .",
    "we assume the resonance line scattering is isotropic and conservative and neglect the polarization dependence",
    ". under such conditions , the reflection and transmission contributions by a plane - parallel slab of finite optical depth @xmath90 have been solved by @xcite . for normal incident flux @xmath19 ,",
    "the angle dependent reflectivity is @xmath91 where @xmath92 , @xmath93 is the reflectivity at @xmath94 , @xmath95 is the reflected intensity , @xmath19 is the incident flux , and @xmath96 is the scattering function defined as @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are two functions that satisfy the following integral equations : @xmath100d\\mu^{\\prime } \\nonumber \\\\ y(\\mu)&= & e^{-\\tau /\\mu}+\\frac{\\mu}{2}\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{1}{\\mu-\\mu^{\\prime}}[y(\\mu)x(\\mu^{\\prime})-x(\\mu)y(\\mu^{\\prime})]d\\mu^{\\prime}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the solutions of these equations may be obtained by an iterative method with the starting point @xmath101 and @xmath102 . the angle integrated reflectivity @xmath103 can be calculated as @xmath104 and is shown in figure [ fig_totref ] as a function of the resonance scattering optical depth @xmath87 .",
    "the reflected flux in a line can be written as @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the line width in energy .",
    "similarly to the `` emission equivalent width '' @xmath71 , we define a `` reflection equivalent width '' @xmath107 , which results in : @xmath108    this `` reflection equivalent width '' from our numerical results is a few tenths of an ev for strong resonance lines , similar to that of the recombination emission lines .    in figure",
    "[ fig_reflection ] , we plot the spectra of the resonantly scattered lines in the energy band 0.5  1.5 kev with a spectral resolution @xmath75 ev .",
    "the top panel corresponds to the case without an intermediate stable layer , and the bottom panels corresponds to the case with an intermediate layer for @xmath76 and 0.1 , respectively . for clarity , from top to bottom , the flux in each panel is multiplied by a factor of 100 .",
    "we see that the equivalent widths of the reflected lines are notably enhanced when there is an intermediate stable layer , but not as significantly as for the recombination emission lines .",
    "this is because the optical depths of many strong lines become much larger than unity , and the reflection is saturated .",
    "if there are broadening mechanisms other than thermal doppler effects , such as turbulent velocity , the reflected intensity can be further enhanced .      in order to gain a crude idea of the relative importance of recombination emission and reflection from the transition layers and intermediate stable layer",
    ", we compare them to the `` hump '' produced by compton scattering off a cold surface @xcite .",
    "we use the greens function obtained by @xcite to calculate the compton reflection .",
    "this method was verified to be accurate with a monte carlo procedure by @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig_spectrum ] , we show the combined spectra including recombination emission and reflection lines from resonance line scattering , and the compton reflection `` hump '' .",
    "we now summarize the most important conclusions that can be drawn from the calculations presented in this paper .",
    "we also discuss the detectability of the predicted line features .    1 .   the unique ionization parameters that characterize the steady - state solutions of the transition layers depend on the shape of the `` s - curve '' .",
    "we have shown that two power - law illuminating spectra with different high energy cutoffs produce very different temperature profiles .",
    "the harder spectrum only allows one transition layer even though there are two unstable branches in the `` s - curve '' , while the softer one allows two separate transition layers connected by an intermediate stable layer .",
    "this is due to the fact that the ionization parameter of the upper transition layer must be larger than that of the lower one , if they are to exist separately in a disk environment .",
    "the harder spectrum produces a turnover point of the upper branch of the `` s - curve '' at smaller @xmath17 .",
    "therefore the transition layer due to the upper unstable region joins the lower one smoothly without allowing the intermediate stable region to form .",
    "the turnover of the upper `` s - curve '' represents the point where compton heating starts to overwhelm bremsstrahlung .",
    "the ionization parameter at which this point occurs is related to the compton temperature of the continuum , @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "a harder spectrum has larger @xmath110 , therefore the intermediate stable layer tends to disappear for hard incident spectra .",
    "although the thomson depths of the transition layers and possible intermediate stable layer are generally negligible , the x - ray emission lines from them may comprise the main observable line features , because the temperatures of these layers are inaccessible to the stable phases , and thus some of the important lines can have appreciable emissivity only in these layers .",
    "due to the much larger cross sections for resonance line scattering , reflection due to resonance lines off such transition layers is also important .",
    "the strengths of reflected lines are at least comparable with those of the recombination emission lines when there is no intermediate stable layer .",
    "because the appearance of the reflected line spectrum is different from that of the recombination emission spectrum , high resolution spectroscopic observations should be able to distinguish these mechanisms .",
    "3 .   the justification of the assumption that the ionizing continuum does not scatter in the intermediate layer depends on the magnitude of the parameter @xmath48 .",
    "the thomson depth of this layer @xmath68 is given by : @xmath111 for the power - law continuum with high energy cutoff at 150 kev ( `` s curve 1 '' ) , @xmath112 and @xmath113 from our numerical results .",
    "therefore , @xmath114 .",
    "@xmath68 is much less than unity as long as @xmath48 is greater than 0.1 . for smaller @xmath48",
    ", however , another effect comes into play .",
    "@xcite showed that the thomson depth of the coronal layer ( the stable phase with highest temperature ) exceeds unity when the gravity parameter ( identical to @xmath48 defined here when the radiation pressure is neglected ) is @xmath115 0.01 .",
    "therefore not much ionizing flux can penetrate this layer , and the reprocessing in the deeper and cooler layers can be neglected completely . as @xmath48 becomes much larger than 10 ,",
    "the thickness of the intermediate stable layer is negligible compared to the transition layers .",
    "therefore , its presence may be ignored .",
    "since the recombination rate must equal the photoionization rate in the irradiated gas , recombination radiation is also a form of reflection ",
    "i.e. the line equivalent widths are independent of the incident flux .",
    "they depend only on the structure ( @xmath116 ) deduced from the hydrostatic and energy balance equations .",
    "the detectability of these recombination emission and reflection lines depends on whether the primary continuum is viewed directly .",
    "when the ionizing continuum is in direct view , our results show that the ews of the strongest lines in the 0.5  1.5 kev band are at most a few tenths of an ev , slightly larger when there is an intermediate stable layer .",
    "+ the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) in such a line can be written as @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the integration time of the observation , @xmath55 is the energy of the line , @xmath119 is the photon flux in the continuum , @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the effective area and resolving power of the instrument , respectively . for a line at @xmath115 1 kev , with @xmath122 , and with hetgs on board _ chandra _ , we have @xmath123 .",
