    "why does @xmath0 cen have a spread in metallicity ? can the largest and most massive globular cluster in our galaxy ( about @xmath1 ) , be a composite object , made up of separate star clusters which merged after they finished forming stars ( norris et al .",
    "1997 ; norris et al . 1996",
    "; jurcsik 1998 ) ?",
    "one or more mergers of star clusters could give an age spread along with a metallicity spread , but this seems dynamically unlikely ( thurl & johnston 2000 , thurl 2002 ) .",
    "the structure of @xmath0 cen is also fairly `` loose '' compared to more centrally condensed clusters like 47 tuc ( mayor et al .",
    "bessell & norris ( 1976 ) suggested that the gas cloud which gave birth to @xmath0 cen was chemically inhomogeneous , and norris et al .",
    "( 1997 ) also discussed the possibility the cluster could have formed when cloud fragments with different metallicities mixed .",
    "all these scenarios could give rise to the metallicity spread which has been observed by many researchers , but most notably detailed by smith ( 1987 ) and suntzeff & kraft ( 1996 ) .",
    "currently , the most popular theory for the origin of @xmath0 cen involves the milky way capturing and disrupting a dwarf galaxy ( possibly a dwarf elliptical like the sagittarius system ) , which is dynamically more likely than merging separate clusters ( majewski 1999 ; dinescu et al .",
    "1999 ; lee et al .",
    "self - enrichment was considered by morgan & lake ( 1989 ) ; their theoretical calculations predicted that the ejecta from 330 type ii sn must have been retained to increase the metallicity over the range observed .",
    "norris et al .",
    "( 1996 ; 1997 ) discussed self - enrichment , but preferred the merger hypothesis .",
    "hughes & wallerstein ( 2000 ) found evidence that @xmath0 cen experienced a period of self - enrichment which lasted several billion years ; their results from strmgren photometry were confirmed by hilker & richtler ( 2000 ) , with both studies concluding that there was an age spread as well a metallicity spread . from these studies , it is clear that the more metal - rich stars are several billion years younger than the most metal - poor stars in @xmath0 cen .",
    "not only does @xmath0 cen have a spread in [ fe / h ] , there is also a well - known variation in the cn - abundances ( smith et al .",
    "2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "another interesting question arises when we consider if the surfaces of the stars could have been polluted by material from evolved cluster members ( ventura et al .",
    "2001 ) .    in this article",
    ", we will describe briefly the results from hughes & wallerstein ( 2000 ) , which dealt with strmgren photometry of stars at the main - sequence turn - off ( msto ) .",
    "we will then turn to the results presented in hughes , wallerstein , & van leeuwen ( 2002 ) on the msto and more evolved stars , including broadband photometry .",
    "the study carried out by hughes & wallerstein ( 2000 ) on the msto stars showed that objects with high metallicities ( @xmath2<-0.5 $ ] ) had an average age of 10  gyr , those in the middle group ( @xmath3<-1.2 $ ] ) were about 12  gyr old , and the most metal - poor stars ( @xmath4<-1.6 $ ] ) were 12 - 14  gyr in age .",
    "the distance modulus used was @xmath5 with @xmath6 ) .",
    "the strmgren data and vandenberg et al.s ( 2000 ) isochrones showed no evidence for a merger in the metallicity distribution ( i.e. , there was no strong bimodality ) .",
    "hughes & wallerstein ( 2000 ) also took data of a single - metallicity cluster , ngc  6397 , deliberately making the data noisy .",
    "this was achieved by only taking a few 900-second @xmath7 exposures of the cluster and not coadding the frames . by this method ,",
    "the distribution of the metallicities was broadened ( derived from the photometry ) , and we used this data set for comparison rather than simulating data . using the real data gave a way of forcing a cluster with no known metallicity variation or age spread to mimic the width of the distribution of @xmath0 cen .",
    "hughes & wallerstein ( 2000 ) confirmed that ngc  6397 was a single - metallicity cluster with no discernible age spread , whereas @xmath0 cen had an average metallicity of @xmath8=-1.5 $ ] , a metallicity range of @xmath9<-0.5 $ ] , and an apparent age spread of 3 - 5  gyr .",
    "we observed one field @xmath10 north of the cluster center @xmath11 times , at @xmath12 wavelengths , transforming @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "the seeing at ctio in may 1996 was @xmath15 and the plate scale was @xmath16 per pixel on the tek  2048  @xmath17 chip .",
    "the field size is 135 @xmath18 135 , but the strmgren filters used at the time were @xmath19 inches ( instead of @xmath20 inches for the broadband filters ) and caused vignetting , thus the effective field of view was reduced to about 120 @xmath21 120 .",
    "this field was selected to be far enough away from the cluster center for the 0.9-m telescope and the daophot software to be able to cope with the crowding .",
    "in addition , we examined the iras sky flux images at 100  and 60  ( wood & bates 1993 ) , and tried to avoid any regions which appeared to have variable extinction .",
    "we took exposures in a field away from the cluster ( about @xmath22 west of our cluster field , at approximately the same galactic latitude ) to subtract field stars statistically .",
    "we obtained @xmath23 photometry on 2554 sources in the on - cluster field , and 1739 stars survived the cleaning process ( for details , see hughes & wallerstein 2000 ) .",
    "the whole data set is shown in figure  2 .",
    "it is almost impossible to recognize an age - abundance correlation among the giants or rr  lyrae stars .",
    "however , where the isochrones separate and flatten out at the msto , we can see if the more metal - rich stars form later , as would be expected from self - enrichment ( morgan & lake 1989 ) .",
    "figure  3 shows that if there was a metallicity spread , and no age spread , the more metal - rich stars should fall to the red side of the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "two colors ( or color differences ) should be measured , one that reveals the age and one that correlates with @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "one of the photometric systems well designed for this purpose is the strmgren system . in principal ,",
    "the use of the @xmath24 system is very simple , but in practice , the accuracy of the data is vital to the success of the experiment .    ideally , it would be desirable to observe in the @xmath25-band to obtain the @xmath26-index ( which measures surface gravity ) , but it was not practical at the 0.9-m telescope because of the transmission of the filter and the faintness of many of our targets in this region .",
    "the color @xmath27 is sensitive to temperature ; @xmath28 is sensitive to line - blanketing .",
    "the metallicity index @xmath29 is thus the line - blanketing at a given @xmath30 , and correlates with metallicity .",
    "the interstellar reddening is nearly the same in @xmath28 and @xmath27 , making @xmath31 almost insensitive to interstellar extinction .",
    "we define : @xmath32 @xmath33 which is the reddening - free metallicity index , where @xmath34    in the range of @xmath35 -2.0 $ ] , the slope of the @xmath31 vs. @xmath8 $ ] relation is @xmath36 = .056 \\delta m_1 $ ] .",
    "hence , we expect a total range in @xmath31 of @xmath37 the models of vandenberg & bell ( 1985 ) , and vandenberg et al .",
    "( 2000 ) show that , at the main - sequence turn - off , the color - magnitude diagram is nearly vertical .",
    "the color index @xmath27 is sensitive to age with a slope given by @xmath38 between 10 and 15 gyrs .",
    "this is rather small to detect with sufficient accuracy , but the color @xmath39 in the broadband filters of the bvri system shows a sensitivity of 0.025 for each gyr , which is much easier to recognize . the effect of abundance on @xmath39 can be compensated for from the tables of vandenberg et al .",
    "( 2000 ) once the metallicity is established from the @xmath31-index .",
    "we had thought that the best broadband index to obtain was @xmath39 , but it became obvious that cn was affecting the b - magnitudes of many stars .",
    "the advantage of the longer baseline in temperature is offset by the dependence on chemical composition .",
    "the harris b - filter extends from 5000  to about 3700 , hence many features are included . in particular , many metallic lines are found here , ca h and k , and also cn(3883  and 4216 ) and ch(4300 ) .",
    "suntzeff ( 1981 ) looked at giants in m3 and m13 , and found that asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars have c - abundances down by a factor for 2 compared with the subgiant branch at the same temperature . in m13 , almost all agb stars and the tip of the red giant branch ( rgb ) , are cn - poor , which would make them look metal - poor on the @xmath40 diagrams",
    ". if cn is weak , the stars will look like they have weak metal lines across the b- and v - bands .",
    "it is for these reasons that we have chosen to use @xmath41 as the temperature index , and have converted @xmath13 to the v - band ( see hughes & wallerstein 2000 , and references therein ) .    before converting photometric indices to metallicities , and finding ages from the model grids of vandenberg et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we have to find a distance modulus and extinction for the cluster .",
    "currently , there is a discrepancy between distances derived from different methods . at one extreme ,",
    "some favor an apparent distance modulus of @xmath42 , @xmath43 from rrab stars ( rey at al .",
    "2000 ) ; thompson et al .",
    "( 2001 ) find @xmath44 and @xmath45 from model fits to the eclipsing binary , ogle 17 , which gives an absolute distance modulus of @xmath46 ; and caputo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find the pulsational distance to @xmath0 cen from c - type rr lyrae variables to be @xmath47 .",
    "lub ( 2002 ) looked at horizontal branch ( hb ) stars in the cluster and determined @xmath48 .",
    "he also noted that @xmath49 measurements imply @xmath43 , infrared dust measurements from iras and cobe give @xmath50 , and ultraviolet observations from whitney et al .",
    "( 1998 ) show @xmath6 .",
    "observations of the star roa  24 by gonzalez & wallerstein ( 1994 ) give @xmath51 : this star is in our field , but was saturated on the ccd .",
    "it is possible that the discrepancy between the measurements of extinction from the uv , visual and ir means that the extinction might be anomalous in this direction . at the other end of the distance range ,",
    "the proper motion study of van leeuwen et al .",
    "( 2001 ) give a reduced absolute distance modulus of @xmath52 .",
    "we compared our @xmath14 vs. @xmath41 cmd to the model grids of vandenberg et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , where @xmath53= + 0.3 $ ] , and @xmath54 .",
    "isochrones and population functions can be calculated from these grids ( bergbusch and vandenberg 2001 ) ; these models do not address gravitational settling or radiative acceleration , but they are derived using current physics . from figure  4a , we see the best - fit to the data is @xmath55 and @xmath6 . however , we will calculate ages based on the other distance moduli to examine the effect on the age - metallicity relationship .",
    "once we have our data set , we must convert the strmgren photometry to a metallicity .",
    "mayluto ( 1994 ) determined a relationship between @xmath31 and [ fe / h ] within the following ranges :    @xmath56    @xmath57    @xmath58    @xmath59 \\leq 0.2\\ ] ]    in all these relationships , the authors assume that the @xmath31 and @xmath27 values are unreddened .",
    "we define : @xmath60 @xmath61 and use @xmath62=5.7071(b - y)m_1 - 49.9162(b - y)logm_1 + 7.9971(b - y)^2logm_1\\ ] ] @xmath63 malyuto ( 1994 ) determined an uncertainty of @xmath64}=0.147 $ ] .",
    "grebel and richtler ( 1992 ) determined another calibration for giants : @xmath62={{m_1+a_1(b - y)+a_2}\\over{a_3(b - y)+a_4}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath65 , and these equations again imply intrinsic ( unreddened ) colors .",
    "hilker s ( 2000 ) calibration for @xmath0 cen takes the form : @xmath62_{phot}={{m_0 - 1.277.(b - y)_0 + 0.331}\\over{0.324.(b - y)_0 - 0.032}}\\ ] ]    from figure  5 , we can see that hilker s ( 2000 ) calibration of @xmath8_{phot}$ ] for the rgb is a better match to all the giant branch stars in @xmath0 cen than the grebel and richtler ( 1992 ) calibration . there is a discontinuity between the msto in their narrow color - range ( malyuto 1994 ) , but improvements will have to wait for spectra of msto stars in @xmath0 cen .",
    "the stars with @xmath66 which are proper - motion cluster members are assumed to be part of the `` anomalous '' rgb defined by pancino et al .",
    "the derived values of @xmath8_{phot}$ ] for msto stars are not very sensitive to extinction .",
    "figure 6 shows the effect of cn - variations on the data .",
    "the open circles in figure  6a are likely to be the cn - rich stars . the well - known cn variations in this cluster ( smith 1987 ) have also been seen in other clusters such as m22 ( anthony - twarog , twarog & craig 1995 ; richter , hilker & richtler 1999 ) . the cn - abundance spread on the rgb is thus shared by the msto stars , which implies the variation is either primordial or the surfaces have been contaminated by agb - star ejecta ( ventura et al .",
    "2001 ) .    as we did for the data set from hughes & wallerstein ( 2000 )",
    ", we divided the msto population ( the cn - normal group ) into three groups : `` high '' with @xmath2_{phot}<-0.5 $ ] ; `` medium '' with @xmath3_{phot}<-1.2 $ ] ) ; and `` low '' with ( @xmath4_{phot}<-1.6 $ ] ) .",
    "the latter group should be the first generation of stars formed in @xmath0 cen .",
    "we plot the data set for the corresponding metallicities for the mean of each group in figure  7 .",
    "most of the data is fit by the @xmath53=0.3 $ ] models , but there is a suggestion that the most metal - poor stars are better fit by the @xmath53=0.6 $ ] isochrones .",
    "the @xmath67-enhancement seems to be becoming less extreme as the metallicities approach solar values .",
    "the maximum age of the cluster also fits more comfortably within the cosmological timescales if we use the @xmath53=0.6 $ ] models for the primordial stars in the cluster .",
