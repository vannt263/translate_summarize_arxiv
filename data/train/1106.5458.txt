    "note that it is trace one by construction , but may have negative eigenvalues .",
    "calculation of @xmath1 from the @xmath29s is a change of operator basis , and in general requires time @xmath2 ( there are @xmath30 values of @xmath31 and each @xmath14 is a @xmath10 matrix ) .",
    "this will actually be the limiting step in our overall algorithm , as all other steps with be @xmath3 or better .",
    "in many cases of interest , however , the operator basis change can be done more quickly .",
    "this will be true whenever the matrices representing the @xmath14s in the canonical basis are sparse .",
    "in particular , if the @xmath14s are tensor products of the pauli matrices @xmath32 on @xmath18 qubits , so that @xmath33 , each @xmath14 has only @xmath4 nonzero elements and the change of basis can be carried out in @xmath3 steps .",
    "now , after the change of basis from the @xmath29s to @xmath1 , our original maximum - likelihood problem has been transformed into the following :    * subproblem 1 * : given a trace - one hermitian matrix @xmath1 , find the closest density matrix @xmath0 ( a trace - one hermitian matrix with only nonnegative eigenvalues ) under the 2-norm : @xmath34=\\sum_{ij } |\\mu_{ij}-\\rho_{ij}|^2 \\label{norm}\\ ] ]    this is immediately familiar as a least squares minimization problem , for which standard minimizer packages are well suited . indeed , this is how the problem is often solved in practice .",
    "unfortunately , finding the solution can be computationally intensive . in standard state reconstruction algorithms , this is the most expensive step by far ( see fig .",
    "[ figure ] ) .",
    "to improve matters , since the 2-norm is basis independent , we can work in the eigenbasis of @xmath1 .",
    "then we observe that the optimum @xmath0 is diagonal in this basis as well .",
    "this is immediate from the form of ( [ norm ] ) , where any off diagonal terms could only contribute positive amounts to the sum .",
    "thus , the problem reduces to finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of @xmath1 and picking the @xmath4 non - negative eigenvalues for @xmath0 that minimize ( [ norm ] ) .",
    "eigensystem solutions are @xmath3 and good packages exist @xcite .",
    "we are left with a minimization over @xmath4 variables , effectively the square root of the difficulty of the original problem .",
    "call the eigenvalues of @xmath35 @xmath36 and arrange them such that @xmath37 .",
    "we now want to minimize @xmath38 such that @xmath39 and @xmath40 . using the method of lagrange multipliers to impose this constraint , and writing @xmath41 to enforce non - negativity of @xmath42 we write the objective function @xmath43 differentiating with respect to @xmath44 we have @xmath45 this equation has two solutions , either @xmath46 or @xmath47 note that @xmath48 does nt depend on @xmath31 so each @xmath41 is either set to zero or given by @xmath49 plus the very same number . to evaluate @xmath48 we must pick a set @xmath50 .",
    "then , summing ( [ xi ] ) over @xmath31 we have @xmath51 or @xmath52 and @xmath53    * lemma * : consider an @xmath31 and @xmath13 with @xmath54 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "then @xmath57 , the distance function for this case , is always less than or equal to @xmath58 , the distance function for a new set @xmath59 .    _",
    "proof : _ we can write @xmath60 and for the case with @xmath61 and @xmath62 @xmath63 if we had @xmath64 this would imply @xmath65 then we would have @xmath66 because @xmath67 .",
    "but @xmath68 must be nonnegative , therefore @xmath69 is never decreased by moving @xmath31 into and @xmath13 out of @xmath70 .",
    "+ @xmath27    the lemma tells us that all the @xmath42s that are zero are together at the end , matching up with the smallest @xmath49s .",
    "thus , rather than the @xmath71 possible choices for @xmath70 we need only decide where to put the break between zero and nonzero @xmath42s , for which there are only @xmath4 choices .    next , we show that the choice of @xmath70 should be the largest set satisfying the constraint that all the @xmath42s are nonnegative . starting from eq .",
    "( [ lambdai ] ) , we imagine removing some element @xmath13 from from @xmath70",
    ". then @xmath72 and @xmath73 in other words , setting any more of the @xmath42s to zero than necessary increases the distance function .",
    "we are now ready to give an algorithm for subproblem 1 .",
    "1 .   calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath1 . arrange the eigenvalues is order from largest to smallest . call these @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "2 .   let @xmath76 and set an accumulator @xmath77 .",
    "3 .   if @xmath78 is non - negative , go on to step 4 . otherwise , set @xmath79 and add @xmath49 to @xmath80 .",
    "reduce @xmath31 by 1 and repeat step 3 .",
    "4 .   set @xmath81 for all @xmath82 .",
    "5 .   construct @xmath83 .",
    "[ alg ] works through an example of this algorithm .",
    "the slowest step is step 1 , solving the eigensystem , which is @xmath3 ( the standard libraries such as lapack start and are limited by reducing a hermitian matrix to tridiagonal form using the householder method which is @xmath3 @xcite ) .",
    "step 2 is obviously constant time , and step 3 and 4 together are easily seen to be @xmath84 .",
    "step 5 involves a choice of whether one wants the answer in the eigenbasis of @xmath1 , in which case it has already been computed , or in some other basis , in which case it is @xmath3 or better @xcite .",
    "thus , the overall complexity is @xmath3 .",
    "the actual run - time of an implementation will depend primarily on the eigensystem solver used .",
    "[ figure ] compares the run time of our algorithm with that of a traditional ml optimization .",
    "our argument that the problem of ml state reconstruction reduces to finding the closest density matrix under the @xmath85-norm to a nonphysical candidate matrix @xmath1 depended on the measurements of the expectation values of @xmath86 in eq .",
    "( [ call ] ) having the same gaussian variance for all @xmath31 . in practice",
    ", this may not be the case .",
    "one solution to this is to equalize the variances by simply performing more of the noisier measurements .",
    "for example , in circuit quantum electrodynamics ( superconducting qubits ) quantum non - demolition measurement of a paulis are performed with @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the measurement rate and @xmath89 is the measurement time .",
    "we have focused only on state reconstruction , but it is often desired to perform _ process tomography _ @xcite , that is , to determine the quantum input / output relation ( a trace - preserving completely - positive map ) implemented by an apparatus . due to the choi - jamiolkowski isomorphism @xcite",
    "such a map can be represented by a density matrix .",
    "thus , the generalization of our result to process tomography should be straightforward .",
    "finally , we note a connection to classical probability theory . if one considers the eigenvalues @xmath49 ( some of which may be negative ) as a noisy view of a _ probability distribution _",
    ", then the algorithm starting from step 2 is an algorithm for finding the nearest proper probability distribution .",
    "furthermore , if the noise is gaussian , this finds the maximum likelihood probability distribution .",
    "consistent with the data but with potentially negative eigenvalues .",
    "we use two techniques to generate the maximum likelihood density matrix @xmath0 .",
    "the top , dashed line , is matlab s * fminsearch * used to minimize @xmath90 $ ] directly .",
    "the lowest , dotted line , is our algorithm for subproblem 1 .",
    "the middle , solid line , is the subproblem 1 algorithm together with the basis change from the measurement outcomes to @xmath1 .",
    "all timings were performed in matlab on a single core of an intel e8400 cpu running at 3ghz . ]",
