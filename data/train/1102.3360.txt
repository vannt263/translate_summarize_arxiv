    "similar problems have been recently investigated in @xcite , where lagrangians containing higher - order derivatives and optimal control problems are considered .",
    "more generally , it has been shown that the results of @xcite hold on an arbitrary time scale @xcite . here",
    "we study such problems within the framework of fractional calculus .",
