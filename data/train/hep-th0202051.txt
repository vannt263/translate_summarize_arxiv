    "it has been well known since early days of string theory that the covariant quantization of the free nambu - goto string @xcite and the ramond - neveu - schwarz fermionic string @xcite leads in non - critical dimensions to consistent quantum models with longitudinal excitations .",
    "the relevance of the ( super)-liouville theory for a proper description of these extra degrees of freedom was first pointed out by polyakov in his celebrated papers on conformal anomaly in string theories @xcite .",
    "the free string models obtained by adding the ( super)-liouville sectors were first analyzed by marnelius @xcite .",
    "more recently the no - ghost theorems for these models were derived @xcite yielding one continuous and one discrete series of free non - critical string models .",
    "in particular it was shown that the non - critical nambu - goto string and the non - critical rns string are members of the corresponding discrete series . in all cases",
    "the first excited state is massive which justifies the name _ massive string _ for all these models .",
    "it was subsequently shown that massive strings admit the light - cone formulation which can be used to analyze their spin content @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the critical strings where the number of the tachyon - free models is strongly limited , the gso projection yields a large class of tachyon - free massive strings with rich mass and spin spectra @xcite .",
    "none of these models contains massless states with spin greater than 1 .",
    "this makes them good candidates for matter fields in an effective description of low energy qcd .    in the present paper",
    "we shall discuss some aspects of introducing interactions for bosonic massive strings of the discrete series .",
    "the solution of the physical state conditions in terms of ddf operators yields in this case three types of physical degrees of freedom @xcite : the transverse excitations described by the @xmath0 tensor power of the 2-dim scalar field fock space , the _ brower longitudinal _",
    "excitations described by a unitary verma module with the central charge @xmath1 , and the _ liouville longitudinal _",
    "excitations described by the verma module with the central charge @xmath2 and the highest weight @xmath3 .",
    "each of these models describes a free string propagating in the flat @xmath4-dimensional minkowski target space , only the structure of the longitudinal sector changes along the series . a special case where the brower longitudinal excitations drop out ( @xmath5 ) and the longitudinal sector consists solely of the liouville excitations corresponds to the nambu - goto non - critical string . our choice to consider the whole series is motivated by the properties of the brower excitations which provide a convenient `` intermediate step '' between the properties of the transverse , and of the liouville longitudinal sector",
    "in the case of the critical string there are two strategies to construct interacting theory .",
    "the first one is the polyakov covariant approach which can be seen as a modern covariant version of the old dual model construction @xcite . in this approach",
    "the on - shell string amplitudes are defined in terms of correlators of the 2-dim conformal field theory integrated over moduli spaces of corresponding riemann surfaces @xcite .",
    "the second approach , introduced by mandelstam @xcite , is based on the light - cone formulation of the free string . in this approach",
    "the unitarity of the s - matrix is manifest while the lorentz covariance requires a ( non - trivial ) proof @xcite .",
    "the light - cone formulation is well developed only for critical strings in the flat minkowski background . in this case",
    "it is equivalent to the covariant approach @xcite what provides a proof of the unitarity of the polyakov formulation .",
    "once a free string theory is known the problem of calculating string amplitudes reduces in both formulations to the problem of extending the 2-dim theory describing the string degrees of freedom from the cylinder to an arbitrary riemann surface . in the simplest case of tree amplitudes",
    "this is an extension of the theory from the sphere with 2 punctures to the sphere with arbitrary number of punctures . in the standard cft",
    "such extension is straightforward . indeed",
    "the puncture with an associated external state can be replaced by an insertion of a local operator what results in a correlator on a sphere with no punctures .",
    "thus there is no real difference between the free theory on the cylinder and the theory on an arbitrary punctured sphere .",
    "this is not necessarily the case in the liouville sector where the operator - state correspondence is subtle and still not fully understood @xcite .    within the covariant approach",
    "one can define the massive string amplitudes by a straightforward application of the critical string construction .",
    "the transverse sector is included in the tensor product of @xmath4 copies of the free scalar cft .",
    "the brower sector can be extended to a cft on an arbitrary riemann surface by combining several unitary verma modules into the hilbert space of an appropriate minimal model . following this line of reasoning one",
    "should then extend the liouville sector to the cft with the central charge @xmath6 and with a single @xmath3-conformal family .",
    "the structure of this theory differs in two respects from the structure of standard cft of other sectors .",
    "first , the @xmath7-family does not belong to its spectrum ( _ i.e. _ there is no @xmath8-invariant vacuum ) .",
    "second , as can be easily inferred from the vafa condition @xcite , with only one conformal family the standard ope for the punctures does not hold @xcite .",
    "this means in particular that the correlators do not factorize on the free spectrum ( in commonly adopted approaches to the quantum liouville theory the spectrum required by factorization is actually continuous @xcite ) .",
    "the main problem in calculating tree amplitudes of string models under consideration is thus a construction of a consistent liouville theory on arbitrary punctured sphere .",
    "such theory is well understood in the so called weak coupling regime , _",
    "i.e. _ for the central charge of the liouville sector in the range @xmath9 or @xmath10 @xcite . indeed in this case",
    "the perturbative continuous formulation is in a perfect agreement with the topological gravity and the matrix model results @xcite .",
    "however , in the strong coupling region @xmath11 it leads to complex critical exponents @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon can be interpreted as a manifestation of the tachyon instability @xcite .    one way to evade this so called @xmath12 barrier",
    "was proposed by gervais @xcite . in this approach",
    "the continuous liouville spectrum is truncated to a discrete subset which enters both the external states and the factorization . however , due to technicalities involved @xcite , it is still not clear whether this approach may lead to consistent string models in non - critical dimensions .",
    "another possibility is related to the conjecture of al . and a. zomolodchikov @xcite that the continuum spectrum along with the 3-point functions proposed by otto and dorn @xcite satisfy the bootstrap consistency conditions .",
    "this conjecture was recently proved by ponsot and teschner @xcite in the weak coupling regime @xmath13 . by the analytic continuation",
    "argument it is believed to hold in the strong coupling regime @xmath14 as well @xcite . finally there exists the geometric approach to the 2-dim quantum gravity originally proposed by polyakov @xcite and further developed by takhtajan @xcite . according to this approach",
    "the liouville correlation functions are defined in terms of path integral over conformal class of riemannian metrics in which the vertex operator insertions are replaced by metric singularities at the insertion points .",
    "none of these approaches is developed well enough to provide correlation functions even in the simplest case of punctured spheres .",
    "even though any ultimate solution to the liouville theory has not been found yet it is still reasonable to analyze the relation between its properties and the properties of the resulting non - critical string . in the present paper",
    "we address two problem of this kind : the construction of the light - cone tree amplitudes , and the proof of their lorentz covariance .",
    "our main motivation is the issue of unitarity of non - critical strings for which the approach based solely on the physical degrees of freedom is especially well suited . although expected , it is a priori not obvious that in non - critical dimensions the light - cone construction is equivalent to the covariant one .",
    "our results suggest that this is the case .",
    "if so , the light - cone approach would provide a useful complementary technique for analyzing non ",
    "critical strings .",
    "it also yields the physical interpretation of string interaction in terms of subsequent joining and splitting processes .",
    "our considerations are based on the following assumptions concerning the correlators of the liouville theory on punctured spheres :    1 .",
    "the spectrum of the free external states is described by the verma module with the central charge @xmath2 and the highest weight @xmath3 ; 2 .",
    "the standard form of the conformal anomaly and its relation to the central charge is preserved ; 3 .",
    "the conformal ward identities hold for the punctures and for the energy - momentum tensor itself .",
    "save for the first assumption ( determined by the spectrum of free string models under consideration ) these are the general properties of the liouville theory in all hitherto approaches .",
    "our main result is that the assumptions stated above are necessary and sufficient conditions both for the construction of the light - cone amplitudes and for their lorentz covariance .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 the free massive string model in the light - cone formulation",
    "is defined and the light - cone local fields in each sector are introduced . in section 3 following the idea of joining  splitting interactions",
    "we construct the tree string amplitudes . in subsection 3.2",
    "we discuss all the properties necessary for the construction of the amplitude in the liouville sector . on this level",
    "the conformal ward identities are indispensable for the state  puncture correspondence . in subsection 3.4",
    "the final form of the light - cone amplitude is calculated . in particular",
    "an explicitly lorentz covariant form of the tachionic tree amplitude is derived .",
    "it coincides with the corresponding covariant amplitude .",
    "this indicates that both formulations are indeed equivalent also in the non - critical dimensions . in section 4",
    "we present the proof of the lorentz covariance for arbitrary tree amplitude .",
    "it turns out that the properties of the liouville sector introduced in subsection 3.2 .",
    "are sufficient to complete the proof . finally ,",
    "in section 5 , we discuss the issue of unitarity and derive some conclusions .",
    "we attached three appendices containing detailed derivations of the results used in the main text .",

    " state correspondence assumed the existence of such procedure is equivalent to the operator product expansion ( ope ) which is a fundamental property of any standard cft .",
    "the detailed construction of the decomposition of the correlator into cylinders of free propagation and infinitely short pants of joining  splitting vertices goes beyond the scope of the present paper .",

    "one can show that the pppe assumption is in contradiction with the spectrum of conformal weights in the liouville sector @xcite .",

    "the only way out is the truncation of spectrum to a discrete subset as was proposed for instance in @xcite . on the other hand one could preserve the space of external states determined by the free string models and use the liouville theory with the continuous spectrum to calculate string amplitudes . in this case",
    "the proof of unitarity known from the critical string theory breaks down and one has to analyze the problem on the level of string amplitudes rather than on the level of 2-dim field theories on the light - cone diagrams .",
    "it is an interesting open problem whether the odzz proposal to solve the liouville theory @xcite leads to the non - critical string amplitudes satisfying the conditions of perturbative unitarity .",
    "the second possibility is to relax the pppe requirement .",
    "up to our knowledge the only approach to the liouville theory where pppe is not explicitly or tacitly assumed is the geometric formulation of the 2-dim quantum gravity @xcite .",
