    "the discussion about the possible contribution of an odd - under - crossing amplitude in high energy hadron - hadron scattering goes back to the early 1970 s .",
    "the seminal papers@xcite established the odderon as the @xmath16 partner of the pomeron trajectory , with an intercept @xmath17 . in the regge picture",
    "the presence of the odderon amplitude would lead to a difference in the total cross sections for @xmath18 and @xmath19 scattering at high energies , and thus to a violation of pomeranchuk s theorem@xcite .",
    "this and other predictions based on the differences in cross sections of @xmath18 and @xmath19 scattering could however not be satisfactorally tested , due to the scarcity of precise measurements at high energies .",
    "indeed , global fits ( see e.g. @xcite ) of the available @xmath18 and @xmath19 data seemed to establish the conventional regge picture , with the high energy scattering dominated by exchange of the @xmath20 pomeron , and with the odd amplitudes dominated by ( reggeon ) trajectories with intercepts @xmath21 ; reggeon exchange then contributes only at low scattering energies .    in the parton picture ,",
    "the quantum numbers of the pomeron and odderon make it natural to view their exchange as exchange of 2 and 3 gluons , respectively . with the development of perturbative qcd ( pqcd )",
    "the interest in the odderon has in recent years intensified , since in the investigations of multigluon compound states , exact solutions to the odderon equations have been found@xcite .",
    "pqcd based predictions , for exclusive reactions specific to odderon exchange , like @xmath22  pb at @xmath23@xcite , as well as for several asymmetry effects due to the interference of pomeron and odderon exchange@xcite , now pose a challenge to experiments at hera and elsewhere .",
    "figure 1 : diagram for exclusive @xmath0 photoproduction , via odderon - photon fusion .",
    "the proton is excited into an @xmath24 isobar .",
    "exclusive photoproduction and electroproduction of pseudoscalar and tensor mesons via odderon - photon fusion are reactions where pomeron exchange can not contribute , and their detection and measurement would therefore be a clear proof of the existence of the odderon .",
    "such reactions are accessible at the @xmath25 collider hera .",
    "the corresponding diagram is shown in fig .  1 , for the particular case of exclusive @xmath0 photoproduction , @xmath26    the cross section of process ( [ eq : process ] ) has been calculated by e.r .",
    "berger et al.@xcite and is of special interest to the hera experiments , since the predicted cross section is sizable and within reach of experimental confirmation .",
    "the calculation is based on non - perturbative qcd , applying functional methods@xcite in the framework of the `` model of the stochastic vacuum '' ( msv)@xcite . in the model the proton is viewed as a diquark - quark system in transverse space ; through symmetry arguments the suppression of odderon exchange in the elastic case ( as well as in @xmath27 and @xmath28 scattering ) can be explained .",
    "this suppression is not present when the proton is excited into an @xmath29 state with negative parity .",
    "thus the predicted cross section is @xmath30 at @xmath31 gev .",
    "using the relation @xmath32 the same is estimated , leading to an even larger predicted cross section at hera energies .",
    "the use of @xmath33 is however strongly recommended@xcite . ]",
    "large cross section is predicted for hera energies , @xmath34 gev .",
    "a characteristic feature of the msv calculation is the @xmath8 dependence of the cross section , shown as @xmath35 in fig .  2 ( @xmath36 is the transverse momentum of the produced @xmath0 , and @xmath37 is a good approximation in photoproduction ) . as seen , the cross section is large in the region of experimental acceptance , @xmath38gev@xmath5 , in contrast to the case of the @xmath39 reaction .",
    "figure 2 : the @xmath0 transverse momentum distribution for odderon exchange ( solid line ) , compared to the corresponding distribution for photon exchange ( dashed line ) .    in order to simulate events of the odderon exchange reaction ( 1 ) ,",
    "the monte carlo simulation program diffvm@xcite was modified to include this characteristic @xmath8 dependence .",
    "further modifications concern the inclusion of the @xmath29 states n(1520 ) , n(1535 ) , n(1650 ) and n(1700 ) ; 42%  of their decays result in a leading neutron .",
    "trivial background was simulated using the pythia program@xcite .",
    "such background is expected from several diffractive processes with incompletely reconstructed final states , like exclusive vector meson production ( @xmath40 ) or inclusive @xmath0 production , @xmath41 .",
    "exclusive @xmath0 production via @xmath39 interactions ( primakoff effect ) or reggeon ( @xmath12 ) exchange , @xmath42 , is negligible .",
    "a comprehensive description of the h1 detector is given in @xcite .",
    "the detector components of importance for the present analysis are given by the simple experimental signature of process ( [ eq : process ] ) : the two photons from the @xmath0 decay are detected in the backward electromagnetic calorimeters of h1 , the spacal@xcite and the vlq@xcite , while the scattered electron is detected in the electron tagger , located 33  m upstream of the interaction point .",
    "the @xmath29 is identified through those decays in which a leading neutron is produced .",
    "the latter is detected in the forward neutron calorimeter ( fnc ) , located 108  m downstream of the interaction point .",
    "the other major components of h1 , namely the tracking chambers and the liquid argon calorimeter , were only used for the veto conditions , in the selection of exclusive events of process ( [ eq : process ] ) .",
    "the data used in this analysis correspond to an integrated luminosity of 30.6  pb@xmath43 and were obtained during the data taking period 1999 - 2000 .",
    "the @xmath44 and @xmath45 beam energies were 27.5 and 920 gev , respectively .",
    "the trigger was given by a combination of energy signals in the involved calorimeters , namely vlq , fnc and electron tagger .",

    "one photon is detected in vlq , the other either in spacal or in vlq .",
    "also shown are the expectations from model ( hatched histogram ) and background ( white histogram ) .",
    "vertical lines indicate the mass region for @xmath0 candidates .    in the first step of the analysis events with exactly two `` good '' photons",
    "are selected , where `` good '' photons are defined as electromagnetic clusters with energy above certain thresholds , with cluster shapes compatible with the photon hypothesis , and with positions within the fiducial volumes of the calorimeters , avoiding energy loss from shower leakage .",
    "at least one photon had to be detected in the vlq ( trigger condition ) .",
    "this selection defines an _ inclusive _ event sample , for which the mass of the two photons is shown in fig .",
    "3a , for the topology vlq - spacal photons .",
    "a clear @xmath0 signal is seen in fig . 3a .",
    "since the events are not yet subjected to an _ exclusive _ selection , this signal can be taken as proof that @xmath0 s indeed can be detected . in order to arrive at a sample of exclusive events , corresponding to reaction ( 1 ) , further selection cuts are applied : no charged track activity is allowed in the event , and the longitudinal energy balance @xmath46 must be satisfied by the energies of the scattered electron and the two photons : @xmath47  gev ( the longitudinal energy balance of all particles produced at the electron vertex is expected to sum up to twice the incident electron energy ) .",
    "the invariant mass distribution of the two photons in the final two photon event sample , after all selection cuts , is shown if fig .",
    "only a few events pass all cuts , and there is no indication of a @xmath0 signal ; altogether 13 events are observed in the generous @xmath0 window , indicated by the dotted lines . these few events are consistent with the background expectation from pythia , namely 4 events .",
    "in contrast , the expectation from the msv model is 110 events .",
    "an upper limit for the cross section of reaction ( 1 ) can be derived from the data , using the prescription of @xcite .",
    "this preliminary upper limit ,    @xmath48    has to be compared with the predicted value of 200 nb at hera energies ; the latter value is clearly incompatible with the observation even when considering the warning given in @xcite , `` uncertainty at least a factor 2 '' .",
    "the upper limit for the cross section of the reaction @xmath49 is a factor 5 below the model prediction .",
    "can this non - observation be understood ?",
    "possible explanations are :    1 .",
    "the energy dependence of the cross section is different from the assumed one , implying that the odderon intercept is considerably smaller than unity .",
    "indeed , predictions for the odderon intercept in the literature span a wide range . the h1 non - observation result can also be interpreted as an upper limit on the intercept , @xmath50 .",
    "such a low value is rather in the range of standard reggeon intercepts , incompatible with the expectation for the `` classical '' odderon .",
    "the coupling @xmath51 is much smaller than assumed in @xcite .",
    "this could be due to the goldstone boson nature of the @xmath0@xcite .",
    "more reliable predictions for odderon induced exclusive meson production can then be expected for heavier mesons , like the tensor mesons @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "predictions for such cross sections have also been made within the msv framework@xcite and their experimental investigation by the h1 collaboration@xcite is described below .",
    "in order to study the exclusive photoproduction of the tensor mesons @xmath1 and @xmath2 , their decays into four photons were utilized : @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "the data set used in this analysis    figure 4 : four photon invariant mass , for @xmath56 and @xmath57 event candidates . also shown are the expectations from model ( hatched histograms ) and background ( white histograms ) .",
    "vertical lines indicate the @xmath58 and @xmath59 mass bands , used for the upper limits derivation .",
    "was obtained in 1996 and corresponds to 4.5 pb@xmath43 .",
    "in contrast to the previous analysis , the four photons were all detected in the spacal , and the trigger was based on a combination of energy deposits in the electron tagger and the spacal , without special requirements on a detected neutron .",
    "the average cms energy is @xmath60 gev , corresponding to the lower proton beam energy in this data taking period , 820 gev .",
    "exclusive events with exactly four good photons were selected , satisfying the restrictions of longitudinal energy balance and no charged track activity . the two photon mass distribution , with 6 entries per event ,",
    "has a clear @xmath0 peak .",
    "however , the recoil mass spectrum , obtained for the remaining two photons for each @xmath0 candidate , has only a weak @xmath0 signal , and no @xmath61 signal .",
    "selecting nevertheless those events with two photon combinations in massbands corresponding to @xmath56 and @xmath57 final states , the four photon mass distributions in fig",
    ".  4 are obtained .",
    "they agree well with the expected , trivial background , as given by pythia . since no signals of @xmath58 or @xmath59 are seen in fig .  4 ,",
    "preliminary upper limits for the cross sections are derived , again using @xcite :    @xmath10  nb  and   @xmath11  nb .",
    "these limits , both at 95  %  cl , can be compared with the model predictions@xcite , 21 and 190 nb , respectively .",
    "multiphoton final states induced by odderon exchange have c - parity @xmath62 and thus even number of photons .",
    "in contrast , final states induced by pomeron exchange have c - parity @xmath63 and consequently an odd number of photons .",
    "exclusive final states of three and five photons were therefore studied , searching for exclusive vector meson production , a process which is conventionally described by pomeron exchange .",
