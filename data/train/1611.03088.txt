    "strongly interacting one - dimensional quantum systems have attracted major attention in recent years @xcite . when confined to one dimension",
    "the fermionic system exhibits a spin - charge separation , and for very strong interactions the charge degrees of freedom are frozen , making it possible to write an effective spin chain hamiltonian for the system @xcite .",
    "methods have been developed to solve numerically for the exchange coefficients of this spin chain for any given confining potential @xcite .",
    "the presence of disorder in an interacting system can result in the violation of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis , due to many - body localization ( mbl ) @xcite .",
    "the localization of single - particle states in the presence of disorder in quantum systems was originally considered by anderson in 1958 @xcite . over the intervening decades",
    ", anderson localization has been observed in many systems , including in electron gases @xcite , photonic lattices @xcite , and cold atoms @xcite . for a mbl phase in the tight - binding approximation",
    "all eigenstates of the system are anderson localized @xcite",
    ". theoretical work on mbl has been focused on the nature of the delocalization - localization phase transition as disorder is increased @xcite .",
    "quantum spin chains have been fruitful models for looking at this transition . in most cases the disorder is introduced in the external magnetic field or coupling coefficients of the spin chain . in this work we still consider a quantum spin chain , but one that is induced by the strong interactions present between fermions .",
    "we introduce disorder in the system via a quasirandom optical lattice potential .    in recent years",
    ", the field of ultracold atomic gases in one dimension has received a lot of interest @xcite .",
    "such systems have been considered for strongly interacting fermions @xcite and bosons @xcite . in this field ,",
    "the mbl phase transition has been observed with interacting fermions in a one dimensional quasirandom optical lattice @xcite .",
    "recently , an experimental realization of only a few strongly interacting fermions in a one dimensional trap has been realised @xcite .",
    "we consider @xmath0 strongly interacting repulsive fermions in one dimension ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : potandsingle]d ) . this system is described by the hamiltonian , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the interaction strength , and @xmath3 is the single - particle external potential .",
    "we consider the repulsive case @xmath4 , and take @xmath5 .    as discussed above , strongly interacting spin-1/2 fermions in one dimension",
    "can effectively be written as a spin chain hamiltonian .",
    "the coefficients of the spin chain have been found to be dependent on the potential and the single particle wavefunctions @xcite , which are solutions to the first term in the hamiltonian ( eq .  ( [ eq : fullhamiltonian ] ) ) .",

    "we will quantify the disorder strength by the ratio @xmath17 .",
    "we calculate the spin chain coefficients for several realizations of each @xmath18 with various phases , @xmath19 , then average over the realizations for the final observables .",

    "[ fig : potandsingle]a , b and c. the main lattice strength @xmath8 is chosen to ensure that the lattice is strong enough to be felt by all particles , without the particles being localized into single sites .",
    "defining the unit of energy as @xmath21 , having put @xmath22 , we set the lattice strength to the dimensionless quantity @xmath23 for all calculations .",
    "for the spin chain we have the hamiltonian @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the pauli matrices acting on the @xmath26th site , and @xmath27 is the coefficient connecting the @xmath26 and @xmath28 sites .",

    "as we will consider the ordering of the states , and the relative energy between them , we only require knowledge of the spin chain eigenvalues @xmath33 .",
    "as already stated , we use the program conan @xcite to compute the spin chain coefficients @xmath27 over a range of @xmath18 , for a quasirandom potential with @xmath34 lattice sites , and a range of particle numbers @xmath35 , corresponding to fillings @xmath36 , with the definition @xmath37 . for each @xmath18 and @xmath0",

    "the average ipr gives an indication of the overall localization of the system .",
    "a standard measure of the mbl transition is the properties of the energy level statistics , which can be investigated via the ratio of adjacent energy level gaps @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the gap in the spectrum between the @xmath55 and @xmath56 eigenvalues , with @xmath57 and @xmath58 taking the minimum and maximum value of the two adjacent gaps in the spectum @xmath59 , ensuring @xmath60 .",

    "we expect the energy level statistics to satisfy a wigner - dyson disitribution ( wd ) @xcite , with the average ratio @xmath63 @xcite",
    ". meanwhile , the mbl phase has statistics that satisfy the poisson distribution ( pd ) @xcite , with an average ratio of @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "first we confirm the localization in the charge degree of freedom . in fig .",
    "[ fig : potandsingle]e , we consider the average ipr over all single particle states for the quasirandom lattice , eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential ] ) .",
    "we find for disorder above @xmath65 the general localization of the single particle states across the whole range of @xmath66 .",
    "the critical disorder for the delocalized to localized transition of the single particle states is weakly dependent on the filling of the lattice .",
    "this result gives a good indication that the particles are  feeling \" the lattice potential .",
    "for the spin of a single polaron we consider @xmath51 of the ground , and highest energy states , then @xmath52 over all other states , with the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : singlepolaron ] .",
    "in addition , we consider two polarons in the system , with the same observables as for the single polaron , but in addition we calculate the average energy gap ratio @xmath61 .",
    "we do not consider the gap ratio for the single polaron due to the small number of states , @xmath0 , in the system , resulting in large variances in @xmath61 over the realizations of the disorder .",
    "naturally , for two polarons there is a larger number of states , @xmath67 , resulting in smaller variance over the disorder realizations .",
    "the groundstate of the spin is found to localize at small disorder in figs .",
    "[ fig : singlepolaron]a and [ fig : twopolaron]a , with strong localization for @xmath68 , for most @xmath66 . with the exception of around unit filling , where we have a spin in each lattice site , resulting in an elongated transition to the localized state .",
    "the highest energy state is delocalized across the system over all disorder , figs .",
    "[ fig : singlepolaron]b and [ fig : twopolaron]b .",
    "therefore , for our system we can never have a true mbl phase , in the sense that all states will not localize .",
    "however , with the inherently delocalized highest energy state excluded , we observe a delocalized - localized transition over a range of @xmath66 .        with the average ipr over all states in the system except the ground and highest states , @xmath41",
    ", we can gain an insight into the general localization properties of the system , see figs .",
    "[ fig : singlepolaron]c and [ fig : twopolaron]c .",
    "we observe a defined transition from a majority of states being delocalized to heavily localized over a range of fillings from @xmath69 . for small fillings , @xmath70 , we observe a trend towards localization with large disorder .",
    "the relatively weak localization of states at these fillings is due to the diluteness of the system .",
    "each fermion ( or groups of fermions ) can be well seperated from its neighbours , resulting in weak coupling coefficients , effectively resulting in the separation of the spin chain into sections .",
    "hence we observe some localization of the state , but not due to disorder in the spin chain .",
    "the regimes discussed are well shown by the cut outs of figs .",
    "[ fig : singlepolaron]d and [ fig : twopolaron]e",
    ".    however , the ipr is a poor measure of the localization of all states , and a standard measure for this ( the mbl phase ) is the average energy gap ratio in the spectrum , @xmath61 .",
    "we calculated @xmath61 for two polarons in the system , fig .",
    "[ fig : twopolaron]d , with a cut out at select fillings in fig .",
    "[ fig : twopolaron]f . for @xmath71 , we see a transition from an extended ( @xmath63 ) to a localized phase ( @xmath64 ) . at @xmath72 , where we are at one particle over unit filling",
    ", we observe the states to have poisson statistics independent of disorder , shown by the white region above unit filling in fig .",
    "[ fig : twopolaron]d .",
    "this is due to the spin chain coefficients having a form that is ` well - like ' at this filling without the prescence of disorder @xcite .",
    "thus the statistics of the eigenvalue gaps are that of the poisson distribution , as has been shown for interacting trapped bosons in harmonic potentials @xcite . for higher filling ,",
    "we see a transition from a delocalized to a localized phase with increasing disorder .",
    "however as we approach @xmath44 , @xmath61 is consistently at an intermediate value , fig .",
    "[ fig : twopolaron]f , which is consistent with a mixed phase of localized and delocalized states .    with @xmath70",
    ", we observe a different regime of the system .",
    "@xmath61 converges to a value well bellow @xmath73 , as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : twopolaron]d and f , with a weak localization across all states as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : singlepolaron]c and [ fig : twopolaron]c .",
    "the convergence value of @xmath61 is not consistent with any spectrum we know of . for @xmath70",
    "the states are localized because of the break up of the spin chain due to the diluteness of the system , and not through disorder .",
    "the gap ratio further reflects the different nature of the localization transition of the states for low filling .",
    "using recent advances in describing strongly interacting confined particles in one dimension , we have investigated the localization properties of the spin degree of freedom .",
    "it is well known that the charge degree of freedom is localized in this system in the presence of strong interactions . for the spin",
    "we observe the localization of the majority of states upon sufficient disorder for @xmath74 . for small fillings , @xmath70 , we observe a weak localization regime due to the system being dilute .",
    "the system considered can never be completely localized , due to the presence of a fully delocalized highest energy state .",
    "this state is an inherent property of the system .",
    "however with the exclusion of this delocalized state , we observe a delocalized to localized transition for both the polaron and two polaron systems .",
    "this transition is seen for fillings above unity by the convergence of the level statistics to the poisson distribution expected in the mbl phase . for low fillings and above a certain disorder strength we see the emergence of a regime with different statistics , due to the diluteness of the system .",
