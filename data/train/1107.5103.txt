    "recently , increasing attention has been devoted to low - temperature behavior of geometrically frustrated magnets  @xcite .",
    "spin glass , in which spins are frozen randomly , is one of low-@xmath0 phases widely observed in geometrically frustrated materials .",
    "however , it is unclear so far how the nature of sg is different from the canonical one driven solely by randomness .",
    "an antiferromagnet on a pyrochlore lattice ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pyrochlore ] ) is a typical example of geometrically frustrated spin systems .",
    "recently , several puzzling sg behaviors have been pointed out experimentally in pyrochlore - based magnets .",
    "one of the surprising aspects is that , in these sg materials , the sg transition temperature @xmath1 appears to be almost independent of the strength of disorder @xmath2 ; e.g. , for ( la@xmath3y@xmath4)@xmath5mo@xmath5o@xmath6 , @xmath7 stays almost constant for @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "similar plateau behavior of @xmath1 is also observed in ( zn@xmath4cd@xmath3)cd@xmath5o@xmath9  @xcite .",
    "another distinctive aspect is that , for these sg materials , @xmath1 is much higher than a theoretically expected value for a moderate strength of disorder @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "these behaviors suggest that some important factor is missing in the previous sg theories : a candidate is the magnetoelastic coupling .",
    "for example , various microscopic probes have pointed out importance of local lattice distortions in y@xmath5mo@xmath5o@xmath6 although this material exhibits no uniform lattice distortion . they are crucial also in ( zn@xmath4cd@xmath3)cr@xmath5o@xmath9 because it exhibits the spin - lattice ordering at @xmath10 .    motivated by these puzzles , we recently investigated effects of the magnetoelastic coupling on the spin - glass transition by considering the following classical heisenberg spin model  @xcite : @xmath11 , \\label{eq : ham - b2}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 denotes a heisenberg spin at site @xmath13 and the sum runs over nearest - neighbor bonds .",
    "the biquadratic interaction @xmath14 is induced by the spin - lattice coupling to local lattice distortions  @xcite .",
    "note that such ` ferro'-type biquadratic interaction favors collinear spin configurations .",
    "we introduce static bond disorder as a uniformly - distributed randomness as @xmath15 $ ] with @xmath16 . at @xmath17 ,",
    "this model exhibits a nematic transition at @xmath18 , below which spins select a common axis without selecting their directions on it ; the system remains magnetically disordered down to zero @xmath0 .",
    "the ground - state degeneracy is equivalent to that of a nearest - neighbor ising antiferromagnet on a pyrochlore lattice [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : pyrochlore](a ) ] .",
    "the ground - state degenerate manifold of this ising model is identified by a set of local constraints enforcing two spins pointing up and two spins pointing down in every tetrahedron  @xcite .",
    "this is called the ice rule because of an analogy to the constraint on positions of protons in hexagonal ice  @xcite .",
    "similar situation is seen also in the so - called spin - ice model in which ising spins along the local @xmath19 axes interact with each other ferromagnetically  @xcite [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : pyrochlore](b ) ] . in these systems ,",
    "the degenerate configurations are separated by energy barriers of the order of the dominant interaction scale @xmath20 , and the standard single - spin - flip algorithm does not work at low @xmath21 in classical mc simulation .",
    "the difficulty remains even when the ising discreteness is relaxed and spins can fluctuate as in the present case of the biquadratic interaction , as long as the ground - state manifold retains a multivalley structure .",
    "indeed , the single - spin - flip algorithm does not work at low @xmath22 for the model ( [ eq : ham - b2 ] ) even at @xmath17 .",
    "a similar situation is seen also in classical heisenberg models with single - ion easy - axis anisotropy .    in the ising case ,",
    "the difficulty is avoided by introducing a global flip called the loop flip , in which one reverses all ising spins on a specific closed loop passing through tetrahedra  @xcite ; the loop is chosen so that the spins are up and down ( or inward and outward ) alternatively along the loop as illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : pyrochlore ] .",
    "the loop flip connect different ice - rule states bypassing the energy barriers . in the heisenberg case ,",
    "however , it is nontrivial how to define the loop with alternating spins .",
    "moreover , the loop flip procedure is not unique because of the continuous degrees of freedom .",
    "these argued us to extend the loop algorithm to the heisenberg case to investigate low-@xmath0 properties of the model  ( [ eq : ham - b2 ] ) .",
    "this report is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : lm - ising ] , we briefly review the loop algorithm for ising models  @xcite . section  [ sec : elm ] is devoted to the extension of the loop algorithm to heisenberg spin systems and its benchmarks  @xcite . in ",
    "[ sec : appl ] , we report results of our numerical study on the model  ( [ eq : ham - b2 ] ) using the extended algorithm .",
    "before considering an extension of the loop algorithm to heisenberg spin systems , here we briefly review the loop algorithm for ising spin models  @xcite .",
    "to generalize the following discussion , we assign black and white to two degrees of freedom of ising spins in an appropriate manner .",
    "for example , black and white simply correspond to up and down spins , respectively , for the antiferromagnetic ising model [ fig .",
    "[ fig : pyrochlore](a ) ] . for the spin ice model  [ fig .",
    "[ fig : pyrochlore](b ) ] , black and white represent inward and outward spins in terms of type - a tetrahedra , respectively .",
    "then the loop flip consists of two steps ; first , we identify a closed loop which consists of alternating alignment of black and white sites , and then we try to flip all ising spins on the loop",
    ".    such a closed loop can be constructed by using the short loop algorithm  @xcite . in the short loop algorithm ,",
    "one traces a path through alternating black and white sites in ice - rule tetrahedra .",
    "a loop is formed when the path encounters any tetrahedron already included in the path as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : short - loop ] . at finite @xmath0 ,",
    "thermal fluctuations induce  defect tetrahedra \" in which the ice - rule condition is violated . to maintain detailed balance , the path must be traced so that it does not involve defect tetrahedra on it .",
    "after the construction of a closed loop , all colors on the loop are reversed simultaneously by flipping the spins .",
    "when all the ice - rule states are energetically degenerate , the flip is always accepted ( rejection free ) in the mc sampling because the flip does not the total energy .",
    "when there are residual interactions which lift the degeneracy , the loop flip is accepted according to the metropolis criterion .    at finite @xmath0 ,",
    "the loop flip update does not satisfy ergodicity because it changes neither the spin configurations in defect tetrahedra nor the number of defect tetrahedra .",
    "it is , therefore , necessary to use the loop flip together with another update such as the standard single - spin flip for retaining the ergodicity .",
    "now we extend the loop algorithm to heisenberg spin systems with the spin - ice type degeneracy : heisenberg spin systems with ( 1 ) single - ion anisotropy  @xcite and ( 2 ) biquadratic interactions  @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : overview - extension ] is devoted to an overview of the extended loop algorithm . in ",
    "[ sec : single - ion ] and   [ sec : biquadratic ] , we review the detailed procedure of the algorithm for the cases ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , respectively .",
    "benchmark results are also given .",
    "the extended loop algorithm consists of the following three steps :    1 .",
    "we first project the heisenberg spin @xmath12 onto an appropriate projection axis @xmath23 to assign black and white colors at every site @xmath13 .",
    "then we construct a loop consisting of alternating black and white sites .",
    "all colors on the constructed loop are reversed simultaneously .    in the case of the single - ion anisotropy , the projection axis @xmath23 is simply given by the easy axis at site @xmath13 .",
    "for example , in the case of antiferromagnets with easy - axis anisotropy along the @xmath24 axis , which are extensions of the ising antiferromagnet  [ fig .",
    "[ fig : pyrochlore](a ) ] , we set @xmath25 for all the sites . while , in the case of ferromagnets with the local @xmath19 anisotropy , which are natural extensions of the spin ice model  [ fig .",
    "[ fig : pyrochlore](b ) ] , we set @xmath26 to the direction connecting the centers of neighboring tetrahedra from type b to a. in the case of the biquadratic interactions , however , the systems retain @xmath27(3 ) spin rotational symmetry and have no explicit anisotropy axis to project the spins on .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to deduce the common axis selected by spins for each mc sample . in   [ sec : biquadratic ] , we introduce a simple way to determine the projection axis .",
    "once the projection axis @xmath23 is defined at every site , we assign black and white colors to sites at which @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "based on this definition , we can construct a closed loop with alternating black and white sites by following the short loop algorithm similarly to the ising case .    in the step 3 , as mentioned above , the way to reverse black and white is not unique because of the continuous degrees of freedom .",
    "three different ways are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : loop - flip ] : ( 1 ) _ flip xyz _ ,",
    "( 2 ) _ flip parallel _ and ( 3 ) _ rotate_. in _ flip xyz _ , all three cartesian components of @xmath12 are reversed as @xmath30 , while in _ flip parallel _ , only components parallel to the easy axes , @xmath31 , are reversed as @xmath32 . in _ rotate _",
    ", which is applicable to systems with global anisotropy axes , one translates every spin to the neighboring site on the loop simultaneously in the same direction . for models which retain the ground - state spin - ice type degeneracy",
    ", one might expect that these updates become equivalent and always accepted at low @xmath0 ; this is naively expected since thermal fluctuations vanish and all the ice - rule configurations with spins parallel to the easy axes become energetically degenerate",
    ". however , this is not the case : as discussed in the following sections , careful consideration on the energy change is necessary to choose an efficient method .",
    "now we comment on technical aspects of implementation of the algorithm .",
    "we implemented a computation code based on the extended loop algorithm , single - spin - flip algorithm and exchange mc method  @xcite , which is used in the following mc simulations .",
    "as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : flowchart ] , one mc step consists of a sweep of the lattice by sequential single - spin flips , followed by the loop update and replica exchange between neighboring temperatures .",
    "the loop flips are repeated until the number of tetrahedra visited in the loop construction exceeds the number of lattice sites .",
    "the loop - flip section takes cpu time comparable to the single - spin - flip sweep .      in this section ,",
    "we review the loop algorithm extended to heisenberg models with easy - axis anisotropy  @xcite .",
    "we start with a simple hamiltonian : @xmath33 where @xmath12 denotes a classical heisenberg spin at site @xmath13 ( we take @xmath34 ) and @xmath35 @xmath36 is the single - ion easy - axis anisotropy . the easy axis @xmath37 defines the projection axis in the loop update .",
    "although the exchange interaction is limited to nearest neighbors for simplicity here , the following algorithm is applicable to more general models with farther - neighbor or bond - dependent interactions .",
    "we consider periodic systems of cubic geometry with @xmath38 unit cells with totally @xmath39 spins .",
    "we take the energy unit as @xmath40 .    for models which retain the spin - ice type degeneracy in the ground state ,",
    "spins fluctuate around the easy axes by angles of @xmath41 at low @xmath42 . under the influence of the thermal fluctuations ,",
    "the energy change in the loop flip is estimated as follows : @xmath43 because the acceptance rate of the metropolis algorithm is given by @xmath44 , thermal fluctuations are irrelevant for _ flip parallel _ in the sense that @xmath45 . on the contrary ,",
    "thermal fluctuations are relevant for _ flip xyz _ since @xmath46 .",
    "this consideration indicates that _ flip parallel _ becomes refection free in the limit of @xmath47 , while _ flip xyz _ not even for models which retain the spin - ice type degeneracy .    the efficiency of the loop flip is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : demo - d5.0](a ) for the model  ( [ eq : ham - di ] ) with the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "this model retains the spin - ice type degeneracy in the ground state . at low @xmath50 ,",
    "spin configurations are gradually enforced to satisfy the ice rule , and the acceptance rate of the single - spin flip , @xmath51 , is suppressed below @xmath52 and vanishes in the low-@xmath0 limit . on the contrary , the acceptance rate of loop flips increases at low @xmath0 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : demo - d5.0](a ) , the probability that a closed loop is successfully formed , @xmath53 , steeply increases below @xmath52 , indicating that almost all tetrahedra start to follow the ice rule below this temperature . at the same time , the acceptance rate of flips of a formed loop gradually increases at low @xmath54 and remains finite ; here , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the rate for _ flip xyz _ and _ flip parallel _ , respectively",
    ". the total acceptance rate of the loop flip is given by the product as @xmath57 or @xmath58 , and it sharply increases at @xmath54 , compensating the decrease of @xmath51 .    as clearly indicated in fig .",

    "@xmath56 approaches 1 ( rejection free ) as @xmath59 , whereas @xmath55 goes to a smaller value @xmath60 .",
