    "the generation of superpositions of macroscopic quantum states in superconducting devices  @xcite have motivated further research on quantum information processing in these systems .",
    "two types of superconducting qubits based on josephson junction devices have been proposed and experimentally demonstrated .",
    "one involves two cooper - pair charge states in a small superconducting island connected to a circuit by a josephson tunnel junction and a gate capacitor ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative approach is based on the phase states of a josephson junction or the flux states in a ring superconducting structure  @xcite .",
    "further , experimental observations on quantum oscillations and the demonstration of conditional gate operations in two coupled charge qubits  @xcite are necessary first steps towards future realizations of quantum information processors .",
    "a crucial step in quantum information processing is the measurement of the output quantum states .",
    "however , a quantum state can not be ascertained by a single quantum measurement .",
    "this is because quantum states may comprise many complementary features which can not be measured simultaneously and precisely due to uncertainty relations .",
    "however , all complementary aspects can in principle be observed by a series of measurements on a large enough number of identically prepared copies of the quantum system .",
    "then we can reconstruct a quantum state from such a complete set of measurements of system observables ( i.e. , the quorum  @xcite ) .",
    "such a procedure is called  reconstruction of quantum states \" or quantum state tomography ( qst ) .",
    "quantum state tomography is not only important for quantum computation , which requires the verification of the accuracy of quantum operations , but it is also important for fundamental physics .",
    "many theoretical studies for tomographic reconstruction of quantum states have been done , e.g. references  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , tomography has been investigated for a variety of systems , including : e.g. , the vibrational state of molecules  @xcite , the motional quantum state of a trapped atom  @xcite , two - photon states  @xcite , the electromagnetic field  @xcite , and rare - earth - metal - ion - based solid - state qubit  @xcite , the two - qubit states in the trapped ions  @xcite .",
    "the quantum states of multiple spin-@xmath0 nuclei have also been measured in the high - temperature regime using nmr techniques  @xcite .    for continuous variable cases ( e.g. , the molecular vibrational mode  @xcite , motional quantum states of a trapped ion  @xcite , a single - mode  @xcite of the electromagnetic field ) , the quantum states can be known by the tomographic measurement of their wigner function . for the discrete variable case ( e.g. , in nmr systems ) ,",
    "the measurements on the density matrix in nmr experiments are realized by the nmr spectrum of the linear combinations of  product operators \" , i.e. products of the usual angular momentum operators  @xcite .    based on the state tomography , a quantum  black box \" connected to an unknown external reservoir",
    "can also be characterized .",
    "black box \" transfers any known input state to an unknown output state .",
    "the determination of the quantum transfer function for this  black box \" is called quantum process tomography  @xcite .",
    "this procedure needs to input a large enough number of different known states into the  black box \" , then to make tomographic measurements on output states , finally to obtain the quantum transfer function , which determines the  black box \"",
    ". this procedure would be very important for the case when the noisy channel is unclear .",
    "process tomography has been experimentally realized , e.g. , in optical systems  @xcite , nmr  @xcite .    to our knowledge , there is no adequate theoretical analysis or experimental demonstration for the reconstruction of qubit states in solid state systems , besides our recent work in ref .",
    "there , we considered a very general class of spin hamiltonians used to model generic solid state systems  @xcite . here , the emphasis is not on a general model but on a specific system : superconducting qubits .",
    "recent technical progress makes it possible to realize quantum control in superconducting quantum devices and ascertain either the charge  @xcite or the flux  @xcite qubit states .",
    "furthermore , practical experiments on quantum computing require the knowledge of the full information of the quantum state , so the reconstruction of quantum states in solid state systems is a very important issue .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze how to reconstruct charge qubit states in superconducting circuits . in principle , if all qubits can be measured at same time in superconducting circuits as in optical systems ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , then only single - qubit operations are enough to assist the implementation of the reconstruction of any multiple - qubit state .",
    "however , our proposal only considers one qubit measurement at a time .",
    "this is because simultaneous measurements of many qubits are currently very difficult to implement  @xcite in superconducting circuits .",
    "another reason is that simultaneous measurements require many probes in contact with qubits , inducing more noisy channels .",
    "these multiple noisy channels will quickly reduce the coherence of the qubit states , decreasing the accuracy of the reconstructed states .",
    "so for two - qubit and multi - qubit state tomography , appropriate two - qubit operations are necessary , due to the constraint of a single - qubit measurement at a time .",
    "although our analysis of the tomographic reconstruction of charge qubit states might seem somewhat similar to the one used for nmr systems  @xcite , there are significant differences on how to realize the state tomography in josephson junction ( jj ) charge qubits .",
    "for example , nmr qst ( like optical qst ) also only involves single - qubit operations .",
    "a question we will focus on is the following : is it possible to do qst with the currently accessible experimental capability on jj qubits ?",
    "in view of the short relaxation and decoherence times , it is also necessary to estimate quantum operation times required for reconstructing charge qubit states . in particular , it is not trivial to find an appropriate two - qubit operation to realize all two and multiple qubit measurements .    here , we theoretically analyze in detail the necessary experimental steps for the tomographic reconstruction of dc - squid - controlled charge qubit states .",
    "this analysis can be easily generalized to other proposals of controllable superconducting qubits ( e.g. , flux and phase qubits ) . in sec .",
    "ii , the reconstruction of single - qubit states is described in detail .",
    "the time scales of operations for measurements of all three unknown matrix elements are also estimated by using currently accessible experimental parameters . in sec .",
    "iii , all operations required to reconstruct two - qubit states are given , the time scales for the first and second qubit measurements are estimated using experimentally accessible parameters . in sec .",
    "iv , using an example , we generalize our two - qubit tomography to the multiple - qubit case . finally in sec .",
    "v , we discuss the  process tomography \" of singe - qubit charge systems based the  state tomography \" .",
    "sections iii , iv , and v contain our most important results .",
    "the conclusions and further discussions are given in sections vi and vii , respectively .",
    "the content of this section on single - qubit operations and the reconstruction of single - qubit states is known  @xcite to specialists in the optical , nmr and other areas ( e.g ,  @xcite ) , where the qst is extensively studied .",
    "but here we specify a detailed description of the steps needed for the experimental realization of the tomographic reconstruction for charge qubit states .",
    "this should be helpful to solid state experimentalists who are not specialists on the qst .",
    "we consider a controllable dc - squid system which consists of a small superconducting island with @xmath1 excess cooper - pair charges , connected by two nominally - identical ultra - small josephson junctions ; each having capacitance @xmath2 and josephson coupling energy @xmath3 . a control gate voltage @xmath4",
    "is coupled to the cooper - pair island by a gate capacitance @xmath5 .",
    "the qubit is assumed to work in the charge regime , e.g. , the single - electron charging energy @xmath6 and josephson coupling energy @xmath3 satisfy the condition @xmath7 .",
    "if the applied gate voltage range @xmath4 is near a value @xmath8 , only two charge states , denoted by @xmath9 and @xmath10 , play a key role , then this charged box is reduced to a two - level system ( qubit ) whose dynamical evolution is governed by the hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath11 where we adopt the convention of charge states @xmath12 and @xmath13 . the charge energy @xmath14 with @xmath15",
    "can be controlled by the gate voltage @xmath16 .",
    "the josephson coupling energy @xmath17 is adjustable by the external flux @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the flux quantum .",
    "our goal here is to determine any single charge qubit state by the controllable dynamical operation governed by the hamiltonian  ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "any single - qubit state ( mixed or pure ) can be represented by a density matrix operator in a basis @xmath20 as    [ eq:2 ] @xmath21 or @xmath22    where @xmath23 are pauli operators and @xmath24 is an identity operator .",

    "the correspondence between these three measurements and the coefficients @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 due to the relation @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the kronecker delta .      in principle , the state of the charge qubit can be read by a single - electron transistor ( set )  @xcite coupled capacitively to a charge qubit . here",
    "we consider the ideal case in which the set is coupled to the qubit only during the measurement .",
    "when the set is coupled to the qubit , the dissipative current @xmath43 flowing through the set is proportional to the probability of a projective operator measurement @xmath44 on the qubit state , which has actually been applied by the experiment  @xcite .",

    "we can also relate the two other measurement operators , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , to the operator @xmath48 ( essentially @xmath38 ) , which is the measurement experimentally realized in the charge qubits .",
    "this is because the current @xmath43 flowing through the set is sensitive to the charge state @xmath49 , so the single qubit operations have to be performed so that the desired parameter @xmath50 or @xmath29 is transformed to the measured diagonal positions .",

    "[ fig1 ] .    in order to make the third measurement @xmath36",
    ", the qubit state needs now to be rotated @xmath53 ( or @xmath59 ) along the @xmath60 direction .",

    "\\(i ) set @xmath61 and @xmath62 ; let the system evolve a time @xmath63 such that a rotation of @xmath53 along the @xmath64 direction is realized .",

    "then , the measured probability becomes @xmath70    with @xmath71 , and @xmath72 we explained how to measure the single qubit states by single qubit operations and measuring @xmath44 .",
    "below , we give an example that shows a reconstructed single - qubit state can be graphically represented , and we further give estimates of the operation times to obtain each of the matrix elements of single - qubit states .",

    "in this section , we focus on the reconstruction of two - qubit charge states .",
    "any two - qubit state @xmath116 can be characterized by a density matrix operator @xmath117 where the @xmath118 parameters @xmath119 are real numbers .",

    "it is worth briefly reviewing that , based on qubit _ state _ tomography , the noisy channel ( usually denoted as the  black box \" ) of the controllable charge qubits can also be determined .",
    "this experimental determination of the dynamics of the  black box \" is called quantum _ process _",

    "\\(iii ) by using the state tomography , we can ascertain these unknown states .",
    "\\(vi ) finally , an unknown quantum channel is determined by the data obtained for the tomographic measurements on these states .",
    "experimentally , in order to determine the noisy channel of the studied @xmath259-qubits  @xcite , @xmath300 known states need to be prepared , and these states must have density matrices which span the space of any allowed input state density matrices .    we have shown that single - qubit _ state _ tomography is experimentally accessible . in order to perform quantum _",

    "thus , the _ process _ tomography of a single charge qubit is achievable using current technology . with further developments of this technique , the _ process _ tomography of multiple charge qubits could also be realized , when data from multi - qubit state tomography is obtainable .",
    "in conclusion , we discuss how to reconstruct charge qubit states via one - qubit measurements using controllable superconducting quantum devices .",
    "detailed operations for reconstructing single- and two - qubit states are presented .",
    "any @xmath1-qubit state can also be reconstructed by using @xmath304 two - qubit operations similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) for different qubit pairs and combining these with required single - qubit operations .",
    "thus the non - local two - qubit operation eq .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) plays a key role in the reconstruction of the multiple - qubit states .",
    "however , this two - qubit operation is not unique for achieving our purpose .",
    "we should note that operations to obtain a fixed coefficient corresponding to multiple - qubit measurements are not unique .",
    "the measurements @xmath187 ( @xmath305 ) on the given state with fixed operations @xmath188 are different for each qubit @xmath306 , because @xmath188 is not symmetric when exchanging @xmath306 .",
    "our proposal can also be generalized to other superconducting charge qubit circuits with the coupling mediated by photons or a tunable oscillator , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite , or other types of superconducting qubits , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we find that the longest operation times to obtain the coefficient of single - qubit and two - qubit states are of the order of @xmath307 ns and @xmath257 ns , respectively , which is less than the decoherence time  @xcite @xmath105 ns . moreover , the @xmath308 and @xmath59 pulses for single - qubit operations can be performed very well , e.g. , in the experiments of the charge echo  @xcite , and nmr - like experiments  @xcite .",
    "another experimental estimate shows us that the manipulation accuracy can reach @xmath309 ( e.g. , as in the second reference of ref .",
    "thus the single - qubit states could be reconstructed and the process tomography should also be accessible in single - qubit charge systems with current experimental capabilities . in principle , the two - qubit states can also be reconstructed by virtue of well - controlled time for the two - qubit operation .",
    "we should also note that larger values of the charge energy @xmath310 , the josephson energy @xmath265 , and coupling energy @xmath311 can make the operation times shorter .",
    "thus these larger values should be realized in order to facilitate the tomographic reconstruction .",
    "quantum oscillations and conditional gate operations have been demonstrated in two coupled charge qubits with the interactions  @xcite always turned on . completely controllable two - qubit charge systems have not been realized yet .",
    "however , the coupled two charge qubits , allowing on and off switching of the interaction , might be realizable in the future  @xcite .",
    "then our proposal will become realizable .",
    "because the unswitchable two - qubit interaction makes single - qubit operations impossible , our proposed scheme can not be readily used to the experimental reconstruction of multiple - qubit charge states when the two - qubit interactions are always turned on . however , for the two - qubit circuit with  always - on \" interaction , most of the single - qubit parameters  @xcite can be tuned .",
    "we can adjust these parameters to obtain @xmath121 different two - qubit operations , and then derive @xmath121 different measurement equations with these operations on input states .",
    "afterwards , the two - qubit states can finally be determined .",
    "the details on how to reconstruct the superconducting two - qubit states with the  always - on \" couplings will be presented elsewhere . however , how to reconstruct qubit states in multiple - qubit ( more than two qubits ) circuits with  always - on \" interactions is an open problem .",
    "in our paper , to simplify the algebra , we focus on one particular family of measurements which are constructed by the direct product of the pauli operators .",
    "however , one can conceive that other complete sets of measurements can also be used to do tomography .",
    "these different complete sets of measurements can be transformed to each other by unitary operators . in practice , within the duration of the controllable manipulation",
    ", the smaller bloch rotation might be advantageous to speed up the measurements , but it might also decrease the accuracies of the measurements due to a longer measuring time .",
    "how to choose suitable sets of operations during the measurement process is an important technical question for the measurement .",
    "it should also be pointed out that here we discuss an ideal case . in practice , the environmental effect is unavoidable , which result in the relaxation ( characterized by @xmath312 ) and decoherence ( characterized by @xmath88 ) of the qubits .",
    "for example , in the single - qubit state tomography , non - negligible @xmath312 decreases all three probabilities of the measurements , however non - negligible @xmath88 reduces the probabilities of the measurements with rotations about @xmath54 and @xmath60 directions  @xcite .",
    "so the environmental effect on the reconstructed states is required to be considered in practice for more specific model .",
    "further , the required quantum operations , especially two - qubit nonlocal operation , are difficult to accurately implement during the process of experiments . for example , the probabilities of theoretical calculations with qubit operations for the first and second qubit measurements @xmath178 and @xmath179 are related to parameters @xmath119 of the equivalent measurements shown in tables  [ tab : table1 ] and  [ tab : table2 ] , however , the measuring results of inaccurately experimental two - qubit operations will actually relate to not only these results shown in tables  [ tab : table1 ] and  [ tab : table2 ] , but also other extra terms",
    ". if these extra terms are not negligible , the reconstructed states might violate the properties of the positive semi - definiteness of the physical state @xmath33 .",
    "a third error source is the imperfect readout of the charge qubit ( for experiments , e.g. , using single charge qubit  @xcite , the fidelity of the readout can reach @xmath313 ) . the limited statistical data also affect the reconstruction of the states . all these imperfection can make the reconstructed states violate the important basic properties of the physical states : normalization , hermiticity , and positivity . in order to reconstruct a physical qubit state , in principle the maximum likelihood estimation of density matrices can be employed to minimize experimental errors .",
    "this method can be applied to numerically optimize the experimental data , which has been used in the optical systems  @xcite and more detailed discussions on this method can be referred to a very good ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "when the tomography is processed , the external flux applied to the squid needs to be very quickly changed .",
    "for instance , the duration for changing @xmath314 within a squid loop should at least be less than the decoherence time .",
    "thus a pulse field magnetometer with a rapid sweep rate may be required in this experiment .",
    "if the sweep rate  @xcite of the pulse field magnetometer reaches , e.g. @xmath315 oe / s , then the time to change @xmath314 in the loop needs about @xmath316 ns for a squid area of @xmath317",
    ".    we also notice that the number of rotations for the measured density matrix elements to a preferable direction ( e.g. @xmath60 instead of @xmath64 ) grows exponentially with the number of qubits . how to solve this problem is still an open question .",
