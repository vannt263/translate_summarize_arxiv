    "the fcal@xmath21 method greatly increases the pseudorapidity separation between the tracks and the ep from about 3 units to about 5 units , thus it is much less affected by the so - called `` non - flow '' correlations , which stem primarily from jet fragmentation and resonance decays .",

    "the consistency between the two methods implies that the structure of the two - particle correlation at large @xmath4 can be largely accounted for by the collective flow .",

    "a rapidity gap of @xmath5 is required such that the near - side peak reflects mainly the `` ridge '' contribution .",

    "[ fig : a2 ] .",
    "a narrow away - side peak emerges in the 6 - 8 gev bin , which quickly dominates the correlation structure at higher @xmath6 .",
    "this away - side peak presumably comes from the fragmentation of the recoil jet .",
    "this figure qualitatively suggests that the transition in @xmath6 from being flow - dominated to jet - dominated , for correlations of tracks from the same @xmath6 range , happens somewhere around 6 - 8 gev .",

    "in summary , the higher - order harmonic coefficients @xmath2 have been extracted both by correlating tracks with the event plane determined at forward rapidity and by using the two - particle correlation method with a large pseudorapidity gap ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "significant @xmath2 are observed and they are consistent between the two methods for @xmath64 gev . the @xmath2 are found to decrease only slightly with @xmath65 in @xmath66 .",
    "all @xmath1 exhibit similar @xmath6 dependence , namely , they all increase with @xmath6 to around 3 - 4 gev and then drop for higher @xmath6 .",
    "however , the higher - order harmonics show a stronger @xmath6 variation , which is found to follow a simple scaling relation , @xmath67 , varying only weakly with @xmath6 . we find the main structures of the two - particle correlation at @xmath5",
    "can be explained by @xmath68 which largely reflect collective flow , and a @xmath69 term which accounts for momentum conservation effects ( possibly including a global directed flow ) .",
    "we conclude that the low @xmath6 correlation functions do not allow significant contributions from a short @xmath4 range medium response to jets .",
    "fluctuations in the initial state geometry , along with a non - zero viscosity of the medium , are potentially responsible for the detailed behavior of the harmonic coefficients .",
