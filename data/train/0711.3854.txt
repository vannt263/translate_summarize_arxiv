    "it has recently been pointed out ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) that the abundances of both @xmath0li and @xmath1li observed in metal poor halo stars ( mphss ) are not in agreement with those predicted from standard big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) . specifically , the @xmath0li abundance as a function of metallicity exhibits a plateau similar to that for @xmath1li in very metal - poor stars , suggesting a primordial origin for both isotopes .",
    "this @xmath0li abundance plateau , however , is a factor of @xmath3 larger than that predicted by bbn . a less severe problem exists for @xmath1li ;",
    "the bbn value based upon the baryon - to - photon ratio fixed by the wmap analysis  @xcite of the cosmic microwave background is roughly a factor of three higher than is observed .",
    "moreover , a longstanding effort in cosmology has been the search for evidence of unstable particles that might have existed in the early universe .",
    "it is thus natural to ask whether the two lithium abundance anomalies might be a manifestation of the existence of such a particle . in this context",
    "a number of possible solutions to the @xmath0li problem have been proposed which relate the li anomalies to the possible existence of unstable particles in the early universe  @xcite .",
    "this has been extended in several recent studies  @xcite to consider heavy negatively charged decaying particles that modify bbn , but in rather different ways . in these latter studies ,",
    "the heavy particles , here denoted as @xmath4 , bind to the nuclei produced in bbn to form @xmath5-nuclei .",
    "the massive @xmath4 particles would be bound in orbits with radii comparable to those of normal nuclei .",
    "hence , they would reduce the reaction coulomb barriers thereby enhancing the thermonuclear reaction rates and extending the duration of bbn to lower temperatures .",
    "pospelov  @xcite suggested that a large enhancement of the @xmath0li abundance could result from a transfer reaction involving an @xmath4 bound to @xmath6he ( denoted @xmath6he@xmath7 ) , i.e. @xmath6he@xmath7(@xmath8,@xmath4)@xmath0li .",
    "although this was an intriguing idea , hamaguchi et al .",
    "@xcite have recently pointed out via a more complete quantum mechanical calculation that pospelov s estimate for the @xmath6he@xmath7(@xmath8,@xmath4)@xmath0li cross section was too large ; this leads to too high a @xmath0li abundance .",
    "cyburt et al .",
    "@xcite further motivated this hypothesis by identifying the @xmath4 as the supersymmetric partner of the tau lepton , i.e. , a stau , and considered @xmath4 transfer reactions for @xmath1li and @xmath1be production , too . although their calculation is based on a fully dynamical treatment of the recombination of nuclei with @xmath4 particles and also of bbn , they used cross sections for all @xmath4 transfer reactions involving @xmath0li , @xmath1li , and @xmath1be that were too large , as we discuss below . therefore , the calculated abundances are to be viewed with caution .",
    "kaplinghat and rajaraman  @xcite observed that the decay of an @xmath4 when bound to @xmath6he would occasionally knock out a proton or neutron to produce @xmath9he or @xmath9h , thereby enhancing their abundances and the abundance of @xmath0li through reactions with other primordial @xmath6he nuclei at higher energies .",
    "kohri and takayama  @xcite studied the recombination of nuclei with @xmath4 particles , and suggested the possibility of solving the @xmath1li problem .",
    "however , they did not carry out dynamical calculations involving recombination processes and bbn simultaneously .",
    "this forced them to introduce artificial parameters for the fractions of the captured nuclei , which turn out to be different from the fractions obtained by solving the recombination plus bbn fully dynamically .",
    "a new resonant reaction @xmath1be@xmath7(@xmath10,@xmath11)@xmath12b@xmath7 has recently been proposed by bird et al .",
    "@xcite that destroys @xmath1be@xmath7 through an atomic excited state of @xmath12b@xmath7 , and the present study identifies another effect in this reaction that might also destroy @xmath1be .",
    "thus there has been a great deal of recent progress in @xmath4 catalyzed bbn in three important aspects : the simultaneous description of recombination and ionization processes of @xmath4 particles with nuclei in the description of bbn , use of updated reaction rates involving the @xmath5- nuclei , and inclusion of new resonant processes by which @xmath1be is destroyed .",
    "no previous calculation has involved all of these effects in a single dynamical calculation of bbn in order to study their effects on the @xmath0li and @xmath1li problems .    in this article",
    ", we present the results of a thorough dynamic analysis of the effects of @xmath4 particles on bbn .",
    "the important difference from previous works is , firstly , that we carried out a fully dynamical bbn calculation by taking account of the recombination and ionization processes of @xmath4 particles by normal and @xmath5-nuclei as well as the many possible nuclear reactions among them .",
    "secondly , the reaction rates on normal and @xmath5-nuclei used in the present study are based on quantum mechanical calculations of the cross section like those of hamaguchi et al .",
    "@xcite , which we believe to be correct .",
    "thirdly , we have not only included the important @xmath1be destruction mechanism identified by bird et al .",
    "@xcite , but have identified another potentially important destruction mechanism involving the reaction channel @xmath1be@xmath7+@xmath10 @xmath13b@xmath14(@xmath15 , 0.770 mev)@xmath7 @xmath13b@xmath7+@xmath11 which has the potential to destroy @xmath1be@xmath7 via capture through the @xmath15 nuclear excited state of @xmath12b . we show that when all these effects are included , the single hypothesis of the existence of the @xmath4 particle provides a remarkable solution to both the @xmath0li and @xmath1li abundance anomalies",
    ". we can then use this constraint to place interesting limits on the @xmath4 relic abundance and its decay lifetime and mass .",
    "we assume that the @xmath4 particle is leptonic and of spin 0 , consistent with its identification as the supersymmetric partner of a lepton .",
    "the @xmath4 would be thermally produced at an earlier epoch together with @xmath16 .",
    "their small annihilation cross section allows a significant abundance to survive to the bbn epoch .",
    "the mass and decay lifetime of the @xmath4 is ultimately constrained by wmap and the present bbn study .",
    "only the @xmath4 can bind to nuclei and the @xmath16 remains inert during bbn .",
    "the binding energies and the eigenstate wave functions of the @xmath5-nuclei were calculated by assuming uniform finite - size charge distributions of radii @xmath17  fm for nuclear mass number @xmath18  @xcite . when the @xmath4 abundance is very high , some nuclei can bind two @xmath4 particles , such as @xmath9he@xmath19 and @xmath6he@xmath19 . in that case their binding energies were calculated using a variational calculation with a trial wave function for @xmath5-nuclides bound to one @xmath4 particle , analogous to the case of the h@xmath20 ion .    thermonuclear reaction rates ( trrs ) for all reactions that might take place in @xmath4 catalyzed bbn , including the @xmath4 transfer reaction suggested in  @xcite and @xmath4 decay ,",
    "were added to the bbn network code .",
    "see kusakabe et al .",
    "@xcite for details on the calculations .",
    "these were corrected for the modified nuclear charges and the effective mass resulting from the binding of one or two @xmath4 particle(s ) .",
    "if the @xmath4 decayed at some later stage , they would be expected to destroy some fraction of the nuclei to which they had become bound during bbn . however , that fraction would be small  @xcite .",
    "we found that the inclusion of the @xmath5-nuclei @xmath12be@xmath7 and @xmath12be@xmath19 ( both are bound ) results in a leakage of the nuclear reaction flow out of the light nuclei or @xmath5-nuclei to produce slightly heavier @xmath21  9 nuclei .",
    "this might be an additional bbn signature resulting from binding the @xmath4 particles .",
    "we determined most thermonuclear reaction rates involving the @xmath5-nuclei by taking account of the lowered coulomb barriers and modified reduced masses .",
    "however , as discussed below , there are a number of reactions that require careful additional considerations .",
    "as noted by pospelov  @xcite , reactions in which an @xmath4 particle is transferred can be very important in circumventing some normally inhibited reactions , especially the @xmath6he@xmath7(@xmath8,@xmath4)@xmath0li reaction .",
    "its rate could be orders of magnitude larger than that of the @xmath6he(@xmath8,@xmath11)@xmath0li reaction , which is suppressed due to its occurrence through an electric quadrupole transition .",
    "hamaguchi et al .",
    "@xcite have recently carried out a theoretical calculation of the cross section for @xmath6he@xmath7(@xmath8,@xmath4)@xmath0li in a quantum three - body model .",
    "their value was about an order of magnitude smaller than that of  @xcite .",
    "this difference can be attributed to the use of an exact treatment of quantum tunneling and a better nuclear potential .",
    "we , therefore , adopt the result of  @xcite in the present study .",
    "cyburt et al .",
    "@xcite estimated astrophysical s - factors for the @xmath6he@xmath7(@xmath22,@xmath4)@xmath1li , @xmath6he@xmath7(@xmath9he,@xmath4)@xmath1be , @xmath0li@xmath7(@xmath10,@xmath4)@xmath1be and other reactions by applying a scaling relation  @xcite , @xmath23/@xmath24 . here ,",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath25 are the s - factors for the @xmath4 transfer and radiative processes , respectively , @xmath26 is the @xmath4 bohr radius of @xmath6he@xmath7 or @xmath0li@xmath7 , @xmath27 is the linear momentum of the outgoing @xmath1li or @xmath1be in the @xmath4 transfer reactions , and @xmath28 is the energy of the emitted @xmath29 ( electric dipole ) photon in the radiative capture .",
    "however , the reaction dynamics are important to these results .",
    "@xmath6he , @xmath30li , and @xmath1be occupy an s - wave orbit around the @xmath4 particle ( assuming the @xmath4 particle to be much heavier than these nuclei ) .",
    "the @xmath0li nucleus is an @xmath31+@xmath8 cluster system in a relative s - wave orbit , while the @xmath32 nuclei are @xmath31+@xmath22 and @xmath31+@xmath9he cluster systems in relative p - wave orbits .",
    "this difference in the orbital angular momentum will produce a critical difference in the reaction dynamics between the @xmath6he@xmath7(@xmath8,@xmath4)@xmath0li and the @xmath6he@xmath7(@xmath22,@xmath4)@xmath1li , @xmath6he@xmath7(@xmath9he,@xmath4)@xmath1be , and @xmath0li@xmath7(@xmath10,@xmath4)@xmath1be reactions .",
    "specifically , the latter three reactions must involve @xmath33=1 angular momentum transfer . in order to conserve total angular momentum",
    "the outgoing @xmath1li and @xmath1be in the final state must therefore occupy a scattering p - wave orbit from the @xmath4 particle , leading to a large hindrance of the overlap matrix for the @xmath4 transfer processes .",
    "thus , a realistic quantum mechanical calculation results in much smaller @xmath23-factors than those estimated in  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the present study , the above three reaction processes were found to be negligible and were therefore omitted .",
    "bird et al .",
    "@xcite suggested that the @xmath1be@xmath7(@xmath10,@xmath11)@xmath12b@xmath7 resonant reaction could destroy @xmath1be@xmath7 through an atomic excited state of @xmath12b@xmath7 .",
    "they also proposed that a charged weak - boson exchange reaction @xmath1be@xmath34li+@xmath35 followed by @xmath1li(@xmath10,@xmath31)@xmath6he could destroy @xmath32 nuclides .",
    "we included only the former resonant reaction in the present study , although we confirmed their assertion on the weak process as will be discussed in a separate paper .    in our exhaustive study of additional processes related to @xmath0li , @xmath1li , and @xmath1be destruction",
    ", we found that the reaction channel which proceeds through the @xmath15 , @xmath36 mev nuclear excited state of @xmath12b via @xmath1be@xmath7+@xmath10 @xmath13b@xmath14(@xmath15 , 0.770 mev)@xmath7 @xmath13b@xmath7+@xmath11 could also destroy some @xmath1be@xmath7 , and that the destruction processes @xmath0li@xmath7(@xmath10,@xmath9he)@xmath6he@xmath7 , @xmath1li@xmath7(@xmath10,@xmath31)@xmath6he@xmath7 might also be significant .",
    "our calculated binding energies of the @xmath4 particle in @xmath1be@xmath7 and @xmath12b@xmath7 are respectively 1.488 mev and 2.121 mev . adopting these values without any correction to the energy levels of the nuclear excited states of @xmath12b@xmath7 , this @xmath15 state of @xmath12b@xmath7",
    "is located near the particle threshold for the @xmath1be@xmath7+@xmath10 separation channel .",
    "thus , the @xmath1be@xmath7(@xmath10,@xmath11)@xmath12b@xmath7 reaction can proceed through a zero - energy resonance of @xmath12b@xmath37 .",
    "however , the measured energy uncertainty of the @xmath15 state of @xmath12b is @xmath38  kev , and moreover , the excitation energy of this level is very sensitive to the model parameters used to calculate the binding energies of the @xmath5-nuclei .",
    "even such a small uncertainty of the resonance energy as 10 - 100  kev would dramatically change the trr because the bbn catalyzed by the @xmath5-nuclei proceeds at effective temperatures as low as @xmath39 .",
    "taking account of the uncertainties associated with the @xmath15 resonance energy , @xmath40 , from the @xmath1be@xmath7+@xmath10 separation threshold , we found that @xmath41  kev maximizes the trr .",
    "this threshold energy would be achieved when , for example , the uniform charge radii are 2.2955  fm for @xmath1be@xmath7 and 2.4564  fm for @xmath12b@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "this resonant reaction is potentially as effective as @xmath1be@xmath7+@xmath10 @xmath42 @xmath12b@xmath43b@xmath44 in destroying @xmath1be .",
    "however , the charge radii we have adopted tend to be smaller than the measured charge radii , and this might overestimate the binding energies of @xmath4 . if a more realistic calculation were performed , the resulting binding energies might shift this @xmath15 excited state upward , which would diminish the effect of this destruction process .",
    "in addition , the transition through this state would be e2 or m1 , which might also weaken its effect . even in this case , though , the atomic resonance @xmath12b@xmath45  @xcite plays the important role in destroying @xmath1be@xmath7 .",
    "since it is important to know precisely when during bbn the @xmath4 particles become bound to nuclei , and what their distribution over the bbn nuclei would be  @xcite at any time it is necessary to consider the thermodynamics associated with binding the @xmath4 particles .",
    "we thus included both recombination and ionization processes for @xmath4 particles in our bbn network code and dynamically solved the set of rate equations to find when the @xmath5-nuclei decoupled from the cosmic expansion .    regarding the thermonuclear reaction rates we note that since the mass of @xmath4 particle @xmath46 is assumed to be @xmath47 50 gev , the reduced mass for the @xmath4+@xmath48 system can be approximated as @xmath49 , rendering the thermonuclear reaction rate for the first recombination process",
    "@xmath50  @xcite to be @xmath51 , where @xmath31 is the fine structure constant .",
    "this rate is almost independent of @xmath46 .",
    "however , the rate for the second recombination process @xmath52 is dependent upon @xmath46 , i.e. , @xmath53 .",
    "this arises because @xmath54 .",
    "since @xmath46 is assumed to be much larger than the mass of the light nuclei @xmath55 , the rate for the second or higher - order recombination process is hindered .",
    "the evolution of the bbn abundances when @xmath4 particles are included exhibits some particularly notable features . during the nucleosynthesis epoch ,",
    "the abundances for @xmath0li , @xmath1li and @xmath1be assume their normal bbn values until the temperature reaches @xmath56 .",
    "below that temperature the @xmath4 particles bind to the heaviest nuclides , @xmath1li and @xmath1be . when the abundance ratio , @xmath57 , of @xmath4 particles to baryons is larger than 0.1 these nuclides are then partially destroyed by reactions that would have previously been inhibited by the coulomb barrier .",
    "at around @xmath58 , the @xmath4 particles are captured onto @xmath6he .",
    "then a new round of @xmath5-nuclei nucleosynthesis occurs .",
    "in particular , the reaction @xmath6he@xmath7(@xmath8,@xmath4)@xmath0li produces normal @xmath0li nuclei with an abundance which is orders of magnitude above that from standard bbn .",
    "an interesting feature is that the @xmath0li formed in this way is not easily destroyed by the @xmath0li(@xmath10,@xmath31)@xmath9he reaction , the dominant @xmath0li destruction reaction in bbn , because the @xmath4 transfer reaction restores the charge to @xmath0li .",
    "hence , the coulomb barrier is too high at this temperature for its destruction resulting in a large @xmath0li/@xmath1li abundance ratio .",
    "the final calculated abundances of the mass 6 and 7 nuclides , however , depend strongly on the assumed @xmath4 abundance . at high @xmath4 abundance levels ,",
    "more than one @xmath4 capture can occur .",
    "although the abundance of these multiple @xmath4 bound particles is too small to significantly contribute to bbn , they nevertheless interact readily since their coulomb barriers are greatly reduced .",
    "this is especially true of charge - neutral @xmath6he@xmath19 . to clarify the nucleosynthesis yields , we have thus made a study in which the @xmath4 abundance @xmath57 was varied over a wide range .    in fig .",
    "1 we show contours of an interesting region in the decay lifetime @xmath59 vs. @xmath57 plane .",
    "curves are drawn for constant lithium abundance relative to the observed value in mphss , i.e. , d(@xmath0li ) = @xmath0li@xmath60/@xmath0li@xmath61 ( solid curves ) and d(@xmath1li ) = @xmath1li@xmath60/@xmath1li@xmath61 ( dashed curves ) for several values of the stellar depletion factor `` d  .",

    "we also show curves for stellar depletion factors of d(@xmath1li ) = 2 , 3 and d(@xmath0li ) = 4 , 25 .",
    "since @xmath0li is more fragile to stellar processing than @xmath1li  @xcite , its possible depletion factors could be larger than those for @xmath1li .",
    "the main point of this figure is that , independent of stellar destruction , it is possible to find a simultaneous solution to both the @xmath1li overproduction problem and the @xmath0li underproduction problem .",
    "this occurs in the parameter region @xmath65 ,",

    "<S> the @xmath0li abundance observed in metal poor halo stars exhibits a plateau similar to that for @xmath1li suggesting a primordial origin . </S>",
    "<S> however , the observed abundance of @xmath0li is a factor of @xmath2 larger and that of @xmath1li is a factor of 3 lower than the abundances predicted in the standard big bang when the baryon - to - photon ratio is fixed by wmap . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that both of these abundance anomalies can be explained by the existence of a long - lived massive , negatively - charged leptonic particle during nucleosynthesis . </S>",
    "<S> such particles would capture onto the synthesized nuclei thereby reducing the reaction coulomb barriers and opening new transfer reaction possibilities , and catalyzing a second round of big bang nucleosynthesis . </S>",
    "<S> this novel solution to both of the li problems can be achieved with or without the additional effects of stellar destruction . </S>"
