    "the light variation of xz leo ( @xmath16 , gsc 01412 - 01030 ) was discovered by @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out this system was a w uma - type contact binary .",
    "the first photoelectric light curves of xz leo were obtained by @xcite and were analyzed by @xcite .",
    "they noted that the light curves presented asymmetries between the first and second light maxima and that the second maxima was slightly displaced to phase 0.76 .",
    "they suggested that there might be two hot spots on both components located near the neck region of the common envelope .",
    "subsequently , rucinski & lu ( 1999 ) obtained the radial - velocity curves of this system .",
    "the radial - velocity solution revealed a mass ratio of 0.348 ( @xmath17 ) for the binary system based on mass - centered sinusoids .",
    "about ten years later complete bvri light curves were obtained by @xcite .",
    "they claimed a blue third light and a hot spot near the neck of the primary component in their model . the solutions suggested that the system is a deep contact binary ( f=33.6@xmath18 ) with a small difference in temperature of @xmath19 . combining with the radial - velocity curves @xcite , they determined the absolute parameters of xz leo as follows : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "they also investigated all minimum light times to find the period increase at a rate of @xmath26 for xz leo following @xcite .",
    "they suggested that the continuous period increase of xz leo could be due to mass transfer from the secondary to the primary component and indicate that this system was undergoing an orbital expanding stage of thermal relaxation oscillation ( tro ) cycles , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "therefore xz leo is a potentially key example as predicted by tro theory , but there have been very few analyses of this system although it has been known for many decades .",
    "therefore , we have carried out new photometric observations of the binary .",
    "we present the multi - color ccd light curves in v , r , and i bands and analyzed the light curves with the wilson - devinney ( w - d ) code .",
    "the new photometric solutions of the system are derived and the absolute parameters are determined by combining spectroscopic with photometric solutions . moreover ,",
    "the variations in the orbital period of xz leo are analyzed .",
    "period investigations are important in close binary studies , because they can not only provide information about some important physical processes ( mass transfer , magnetic activity cycles ) , but also can give us a hint of the evolutionary stage of the binaries . to obtain an accurate period and period changes , long - time - span data sets and the precise times of light minimum data are important and necessary . here , we collected all available original data of xz leo to obtain reliable results . finally , based on the period changes and the photometric solutions of xz leo , the geometric structure and evolutionary stage of this system are discussed .",
    "new ccd photometric observations of xz leo in v- , r- , and i- bands were made on three nights in 2014 ( february 24 , 27 and march 9 ) with the 85 cm reflecting telescope at xinglong station of the national astronomical observatory , chinese academy of sciences ( naoc ) .",
    "a 1024 @xmath27 1024 pi ccd camera and a standard johnson - cousins - bessel multicolor filter system were used during the observation @xcite .",
    "the effective field of view is @xmath28 @xmath27 @xmath29 .",
    "a total of 2110 individual observations were obtained in the three band passes ( 735 in v , 732 in r and 643 in i ) , which covered a timespan of about 24 hr . the twilight sky flat , bias and dark frames were taken on each observing day , which were processed with the standard routines of ccdproc in the iraf package at first .",
    "then , the instrumental magnitudes of stars detected in the program field were obtained by phot of the aperture photometry package of iraf .",
    "a star near the variable star was chosen as the comparison star ( tyc 1412 - 247 - 1 ) , which has a brightness and color similar to that of the variable star .",
    "another star in the same field of view was selected as the check star ( bd+17 2163a , gsc 01412 - 00423 ) .",
    "the differential magnitudes of these stars were extracted in each frame .",
    "the corresponding coordinates of xz leo , the comparison and check stars are shown in table 1 .",
    "complete light curves in the v , r , and i bands are displayed in figure 1 with open circles , where phases were computed using a period of 0.487739 days .",
    "this period is reconfirmed with the new data in this paper .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , the observational light curves with open circles are typical ew - type light curves where the depths of both light minimum are nearly the same .",
    "the light curves do not show the oconnell effects ( different heights of the two light maximum ) of unequal light levels at the quadratures beyond the limits of the the observational error of about @xmath30 mag .",
    "but the maxima i ( phase = 0.25 ) and maxima ii ( phase = 0.75 ) of the light curves are displaced to around phases 0.24 and 0.76 respectively , which are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the solid line is the maxima i at phase = 0.25 and maxima ii at phase = 0.75 ( upper panel ) and the dotted line are phases at 0.24 and 0.76 ( lower panel ) .",
    "these very same displacements are also found by niarchos ( 1993 ) in the hoffmann ( 1984 ) light curve as well as in the lee et al .",
    "( 2006 ) light curves .",
    "that means this displacement of the maxima is a long - term effect probably indicative of a long - term asymmetry in the system . in our observations ,",
    "a total of 4 eclipses of the contact binary xz leo were covered , including 2 primary and 2 secondary ones . by applying the k - w method @xcite , the epochs of minimum light with the mean values of v , r and i filters were determined as given in table 2 .",

    "initially , when no other physical processes are added into the binary model , we can not obtain a satisfactory fitting of the light curves . in order to solve this problem ,",

    "the tro theory suggests that the evolution of w uma stars must undergo oscillations around the status of contact and non - contact .",
    "this indicates that the contact binary xz leo is in an expanding tro state before broken - contact phase at present , as suggested by qian ( 2001a ) . by considering conservative mass transfer , a calculation with the well - known equation",
    ", @xmath107 leads to a mass transfer rate of @xmath108 .",
    "this will cause the mass of the secondary component and hence the mass ratio to decrease . conclusively",
    ", the contact binary of xz leo will evolve to broken - contact state .",
    "based on mass and angular momentum conservations , the time of evolution from contact to broken - contact state was estimated to be @xmath15 yr .",
    "about 0.06 @xmath3 will be transfered from the secondary to the primary component and the mass ratio q will decrease from 0.348 to 0.304 .",
