    "although multiplayer games have been extensively studied in the game theory literature @xcite their analysis is often found more complex than for two - player games @xcite .",
    "economics @xcite and mathematical biology @xcite are the areas where most applications of multiplayer games are discussed .",
    "quantum games first came into prominence following the work of meyer meyerdavid and eisert et al @xcite .",
    "however , the first game - like situations involving many agents were brought to the quantum regime in 1990 by mermin @xcite .",
    "mermin analyzed a multiplayer game that can be won with certainty when it is played using spin - half particles in a greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state @xcite , while no classical strategy can achieve this .    in 1999 , vaidman @xcite described the ghz paradox @xcite using a game among three players .",
    "vaidman s game is now well known in the quantum game literature . in a similar vein ,",
    "others aharonovrohrlich , fulton have discussed game - like situations involving many players for which quantum mechanics significantly helps their chances of winning .    the motivation behind these developments @xcite was to use a game framework in order to demonstrate the remarkable , and often counterintuitive , quantum correlations that may arise when many agents interact while sharing quantum resources .",
    "systematic procedures were suggested benjaminhayden , marinattoweber , johnson , piotrowski , du , flitney , flitneyabbotta , flitneyabbottb , flitneyabbottc , cheon , shimamura , iqbalcheona , iqbaltoor1,iqbaltoor2,iqbaltoor3,iqbalweigert to quantize a given game and earlier work considered noncooperative games in their normal - form @xcite .",
    "the approach towards playing quantum games is distinct in that , instead of inventing games in which quantum correlations help players winning games , it proposes quantization procedures for given and very often well known games .",
    "that is , instead of tailoring ` winning conditions ' for the invented games , which can be satisfied when the game is played by quantum players , quantum game theory finds how the sharing of quantum resources may replace / displace / change the solution(s ) or the outcome(s ) of known games .",
    "the emphasis is , therefore , shifted from inventing games to the writing of prescription(s ) for quantizing well - known games .    in the area of quantum games ,",
    "multiplayer games were first studied by benjamin and hayden @xcite and have subsequently been considered by many others kayjohnson , duli , hanzhang , iqbaltoor , flitneyabbott , chenwang , flitneyhollenberg , flitneyhollenberg1 .",
    "this paper extends to multiplayer quantum games the probabilistic framework originally proposed for two - player noncooperative games by present authors in ref .",
    "this framework unifies classical and quantum two - player games while using the einstein - podolsky - rosen - bohm ( epr - bohm ) experiments @xcite to play a two - player game .",
    "it has been reported in literature @xcite that joint probabilities in epr - bohm experiments may not be factorizable .",
    "this led us in refs .",
    "@xcite to construct quantum games from non - factorizable joint probabilities .",
    "to ensure that the classical game remains embedded within the corresponding quantum game , this framework requires that quantum game attains classical interpretation when joint probabilities are factorizable .    as this framework proposes an entirely probabilistic argument in the construction of quantum games it thus provides a unifying perspective for both classical and quantum games .",
    "it also presents a more accessible analysis of quantum games , which can be of potential interest to readers outside the quantum physics domain .",
    "we consider three - player symmetric ( noncooperative ) games in which three players ( henceforth labelled as alice , bob , and chris ) make their choices simultaneously .",
    "the players are assumed located at distance and that they are unable to communicate among themselves .",
    "they , however , can communicate to a referee who organizes the game and ensures that the rules of the game are obeyed by the participating parties .",
    "we assume that each player has two choices that we refer to as his / her pure strategies .",
    "the payoff relations are made public by the referee at the start of the game . at some particular instant",
    "the players are asked to inform the referee of their strategies .",
    "the players payoffs depend on the game they play , their strategies , and the set of joint probabilities relevant to the probabilistic system which they share in order to play the game .",
    "we assume alice s strategies are @xmath0 @xmath1 ; bob s strategies are @xmath2 @xmath3 ; and chris strategies are @xmath4 @xmath5 and that we have the following pure - strategy payoff relations @xcite that define the game    @xmath6    where the subscripts @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 refer to alice , bob , and chris , respectively .    in one of these payoff relations , the three entries in brackets on left side are alice s , bob s , and chris pure strategies , respectively , and the three numbers on the right side are their rewards , respectively .",
    "for example , @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 states that alice , bob , and chris obtain @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath12 , respectively , when they play the strategies @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 , respectively .    in repeated runs , a player can choose between his / her two pure strategies with some probability , which defines his / her mixed - strategy .",
    "we denote a mixed - strategy by @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 $ ] for alice , bob , and chris , respectively . these are probabilities with which alice , bob , and chris play the pure strategies @xmath0 @xmath21 @xmath17 , respectively . they , then , play the pure strategies @xmath22",

    "mathematically , this is expressed by the conditions    @xmath29    the payoff relations ( [ 3-coin mixed - strategy payoffs ] ) satisfy these conditions ( [ constraints for symmetric game ] ) when @xcite ,    @xmath30    a symmetric three - player game can , therefore , be defined by only six constants @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath13 @xmath33 @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in the rest of this paper",
    "we will define these six constants to be @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",

    "quantum physics has been added to this list .",
    "this game was investigated @xcite early in the history of quantum games and is known to have had provided significant motivation for further work in this area .",
    "two - player pd is about two criminals ( referred hereafter as players ) who are arrested after having committed a crime .",
    "the investigators have the following plan to make them confess their crime .",
    "both are placed in separate cells and are not allowed to communicate .",
    "they are contacted individually and are asked to choose between two choices ( strategies ) : _ to confess _ @xmath49 and _ not to confess _",
    "@xmath50 , where @xmath9 and @xmath51 stand for cooperation and defection and this well - known wording of their available choices refers to the fellow prisoner and not to the authorities .    the rules state that if neither prisoner confesses , i.e. @xmath52 , both are given freedom ; when one prisoner confesses @xmath53 and the other does not @xmath50 , i.e. @xmath54 or @xmath55 , the prisoner who confesses gets freedom as well as financial reward , while the prisoner who did not confess ends up in the prison for a longer term .",
    "when both prisoners confess , i.e. @xmath56 , both are given a reduced term .",
    "in the two - player case the strategy pair @xmath56 comes out as the unique ne ( and the rational outcome ) of the game , leading to the situation of both having reduced term .",
    "the game offers a dilemma as the rational outcome @xmath57 differs from the outcome @xmath52 , which is an available choice , and for which both prisoners get freedom .",
    "the three - player pd is defined by making the association :    @xmath58    and afterwards imposing the following conditions @xcite :    \\a ) the strategy @xmath1 is a dominant choice @xcite for each player . for alice",
    "this requires :    @xmath59    and similar inequalities hold for players bob and chris .",

    "this requires :    @xmath61    and similar relations hold for bob and chris .",
    "translating the above conditions while using the notation introduced in ( symmetric 3-player game definition ) requires :    @xmath62    which define a generalized three - player pd .",
    "for example @xcite , by letting @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66  @xmath67 @xmath68 all of these conditions hold .",
    "we consider the situation when three players share a probabilistic system to play the three - player symmetric game defined in the section ( [ sg ] ) . for this system , in a run , a player has to choose between one out of two pure strategies and , in either case , the outcome ( of some measurement , or observation , which follows after players have made their choices ) is either @xmath69 or @xmath70 .",
    "when we associate @xmath71 with the head and @xmath70 with the tail of a coin , sharing coins ( not necessarily unbiased ) provides a physical realization of a probabilistic physical system . in the following we consider two setups , both of which use coins in order to play the symmetric three - player game ( [ symmetric 3-player game definition ] ) .",
    "we find that the later setup provides an appropriate arrangement for introducing joint probabilities ( associated with an epr - bohm setting involving three observers ) in the playing of a three - player game .",
    "we note that in the standard epr - bohm setting , in a run , each one of the spatially - separated observers chooses one between two directions . a quantum measurement along the two chosen directions , in a run ,",

    "that is , in a run one of the four possible outcomes @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 emerges .",
    "the most natural scenario for playing a three - player game , when they share a probabilistic physical system that involves three coins , is the one when in a run each player is given a coin in a head state , and ` to flip ' or to ` not to flip ' are the player s available strategies .",
    "we denote alice s , bob s , and chris strategy ` to flip ' by @xmath0 @xmath21 and @xmath80 , respectively , and likewise , we denote alice s , bob s , and chris strategy ` not to flip ' by @xmath22 @xmath16 and @xmath81 respectively .",
    "the three coins are then passed to a referee who rewards players after observing the state of the three coins .    in repeated runs , the players alice , bob , and chris",

    "we call this arrangement , which uses three coins to play a three - player game , the _ three - coin setup_.      the three - player game ( [ symmetric 3-player game definition ] ) can also be played using six coins ( not necessarily unbiased ) instead of the three .",
    "this can be arranged as follows .",
    "two coins are assigned to each player before the game begins . in a run",
    "each player chooses one out of the two , which defines his / her strategy in the run .",
    "three coins are , therefore , chosen in a run .",
    "the three chosen coins are passed to a referee who tosses them together and observes the outcome .",
    "many such outcomes are observed as the process of receiving , choosing , and subsequently tossing the coins is repeated many times .",
    "after many runs , the referee rewards the players according to their strategies ( i.e.  which coin(s ) they have chosen over many runs ) , the outcomes of several tosses giving rise to the underlying statistics of the coins and from the six coefficients defining the three - player symmetric game defined in section ( [ sg ] ) .",
    "notice that coins are tossed in each run , which gives the playing of a game an inherently probabilistic character .",
    "this paves the way to step into the quantum regime and provides the key for introducing quantum probabilities .",
    "we call this arrangement of using six coins , for playing a three - player game , the _ six - coin setup_. why introduce a six - coin setup when a three - player game can also be played in three - coin setup ?",
    "the answer is provided by the epr - bohm setting that involves three observers and @xmath92 joint probabilities .",
    "the six coin setup allows us to translate the playing of a three - player game in terms of @xmath92 joint probabilities . when these joint probabilities are quantum mechanical ( and are obtained from an epr - bohm setting involving three observers )",
    "they might have the unusual character of being non - factorizable .",
    "that is , the six - coin setup serves as an intermediate step allowing us to see the impact of non - factorizable quantum probabilities on the solution of a game .    in the six - coin setup , by our definition , a player plays a pure strategy when s / he chooses the same coin over all the runs and s / he plays a mixed strategy when s / he chooses his / her first coin with some probability over the runs .",
    "notice that , by its construction , this setup requires a large number of runs for playing a game , irrespective of whether players play the pure strategies or the mixed strategies , as in either case players payoffs depend on outcomes of many tosses .",
    "we denote alice s two coins by @xmath0 @xmath1 ; bob s two coins by @xmath2 @xmath3 ; and chris two coins by @xmath93 @xmath24 .",
    "heads of a coin is associated ( as it is in the three - coin setup ) with @xmath71 and tails with @xmath70 , and we denote the outcome of alice s , bob s , and chris coins as @xmath94 @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .    alice s outcome of @xmath97 or @xmath70 , whether she goes for the @xmath84-coin or the @xmath1-coin in a run , is independent of bob s outcome of @xmath98 or @xmath70 as well as whether he goes for the @xmath86-coin or the @xmath3-coin in the same run . also , both of these outcomes are independent of chris outcome of @xmath99 or @xmath70 as well as whether he goes for the @xmath17-coin or the @xmath88-coin in the same run .    the associated probabilities are , therefore , factorizable in the sense that the probability for a triplet of outcomes can be expressed as the product of probability for each outcome separately .",
    "mathematically , this is expressed by writing joint probabilities as the arithmetic product of their respective marginals , i.e.    @xmath100    where , for example , bob can set @xmath101 at @xmath86 or at @xmath3 and the probability @xmath102 factorizes to @xmath103 .    as @xmath0 @xmath21 @xmath17 are alice s , bob s , and chris first coins , respectively , we assign probabilities @xmath104 $ ] by defining @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .",
    "namely , @xmath108 is the probability of getting head for ( alice s ) @xmath84-coin ; @xmath109 is the probability of getting head for ( bob s ) @xmath86-coin ; and @xmath110 is the probability of getting head for ( chris ) @xmath17-coin .",

    "a mixed - strategy game , in the six - coin setup , corresponds to when , over a large number of runs of the game , a player chooses one of the two available coins with some probability .",

    "six - coin mixed - strategy payoff relations ( [ 6-coin mixed - strategy payoffs ] ) are mathematically identical to the three - coin mixed - strategy payoff relations ( [ 3-coin mixed - strategy payoffs ] )",
    ". however , these equations are to be interpreted differently as the definitions of what constitutes a strategy in three- and six - coin setups are different . in ( [ 3-coin mixed - strategy payoffs ] ) the numbers @xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath129 are the probabilities with which alice , bob , and chris , respectively , flip the coin that s / he receives .",
    "whereas in ( [ 6-coin mixed - strategy payoffs ] ) the numbers @xmath18 @xmath132 and @xmath129 are the probabilities with which , over repeated runs , alice , bob , and chris choose the @xmath84-coin , the @xmath86-coin , and the @xmath87-coin , respectively .    referring to ( [ 6-coin mixed - strategy payoffs ] ) , the triplet @xmath133 becomes a ne when the following inequalities hold@xmath134which , though being mathematically identical to ( [ 3-coin ne ] ) , refers to the relations ( [ 6-coin mixed - strategy payoffs ] ) and eqs .",
    "( [ 6coin-1]-[6coin-8 ] ) . also , these inequalities are to be interpreted in terms of how a strategy is defined in the six - coin setup .      in the following",
    "we use the three - coin and the six - coin setups to play pd .      in three - coin setup , the inequalities ( [ 3-coin ne ] ) give    @xmath135    and @xmath136 comes out as a unique ne at which players payoffs are @xmath137 @xmath138 , and @xmath139      the ne conditions ( [ 6-coin ne ] ) are evaluated using the payoff relations ( [ 6-coin mixed - strategy payoffs ] ) and the eqs .",
    "( [ 6coin-1]-6coin-8 ) .",
    "we consider the case when @xmath140 i.e. the probabilities of getting head for each player s second coin is zero .",
    "this reduces the ne conditions ( [ 6-coin ne ] ) to    @xmath141    where @xmath142 @xmath143 and @xmath144 . for pd",
    "we have @xmath145 , it then follows from ( ne - six - coin pd ) that , when @xmath146 , the strategy triplet @xmath136 , as is defined in the six - coin setup , comes out to be a unique ne in the three - player symmetric game of pd . in other words",
    ", this is described by saying that the triplet @xmath136 emerges as a unique ne when the probabilities of getting a head for each player s second coin is zero and , along with this , that the joint probabilities are factorizable .",
    "now the crucial step follows : requiring coins to satisfy the constraint @xmath147 can also be translated in terms of constraints on the joint probabilities associated to the six coins . to find these constraints we identify the @xmath92 joint probabilities @xmath148 that can be defined for six coins , and are given as follows :    @xmath149    @xmath150    @xmath151    @xmath152    @xmath153    @xmath154    @xmath155    @xmath156    with these definitions the payoff relations ( [ 6coin-1]-[6coin-8 ] ) are re - expressed as    @xmath157    @xmath158    @xmath159    @xmath160    @xmath161    @xmath162    @xmath163    @xmath164    now , from the definitions ( [ 6coin probs 1]-[6coin probs 8 ] ) , requiring coins to satisfy the constraint @xmath140 makes a number of the joint probabilities vanish :    @xmath165    which , in turn , reduces the pure - strategy payoff relations ( [ 6coin-1a]-[6coin-8a ] ) to    @xmath166    where only those joint probabilities",
    "are left that can have non - zero value(s ) .",
    "these ( pure strategy ) payoff relations ensure that when the joint probabilities ( involved in these expressions ) become factorizable the classical outcome of the game results .",
    "in the quantum game literature meyerdavid , ewl , benjaminhayden , marinattoweber , johnson , piotrowski , du , flitney , cheon , shimamura , iqbal , three - player games have been studied but it appears that they have attracted less attention then the two - player games .",
    "this is understandable as their analysis is often found to be significantly harder even in the classical regime .    as mentioned in section",
    "[ intro ] , an interesting example of a three - player quantum game was discussed by vaidman @xcite who described the ghz paradox @xcite as a game among three players .",
    "vaidman constructed a game , and tailored its winning conditions , such that the winning chances for a classical team of three players can not exceed @xmath167 .",
    "a team of quantum players , however , are able to win the game @xmath168 if they share a ghz state .    an analysis of vaidman s game shows that it is won @xmath168 by a team of quantum players having access to a probabilistic physical system for which the joint probabilities are non - factorizable in a way described by the winning conditions of the game .",
    "these conditions are constructed such that a set of non - factorizable joint probabilities generated by the ghz state results in the team always winning the game .",
    "although vaidman s game demonstrates how the ghz state can be helpful in winning a game , by itself this quantum game does not present a quantization scheme for a general three - player noncooperative game .",
    "this was achieved by benjamin and hayden @xcite who developed a multiplayer extension of eisert et al.s quantization scheme @xcite , originally proposed for two - player noncooperative games .",
    "eisert et al.s scheme is widely considered to have led to the birth of the area of quantum games .",
    "however , vaidman s game offers an interesting situation , which motivates one to ask what may happen to a generalized three - player noncooperative symmetric game , when the participating players share a probabilistic system for which joint probabilities are not factorizable .",
    "this is precisely the question that we aim to address in the present paper .",
    "we consider an epr - bohm setting for three spatially - separated observers and use it to play a general three - player symmetric noncooperative game .",
    "this setting can be described as follows :    \\a ) three observers , henceforth called the players alice , bob , and chris , are distantly located and are not able to communicate among themselves .",
    "\\b ) in a run , each player receives a particle and has to choose one out of the two directions and to inform the referee of his / her choice ( henceforth called his / her pure strategy ) .",
    "\\c ) the referee , after receiving information on the three players strategies in a run ( which are three directions ) rotates his stern - gerlach type detectors along these directions and makes a measurement using pauli spin observables .",
    "\\d ) the two directions available to each player correspond to the two kinds of ( non - commuting ) measurements that can be performed by the referee in a run .",
    "\\e ) the outcome of a measurement , in a run , along any one of the three chosen directions is either @xmath71 or @xmath70 .",
    "\\f ) over a large number of runs , a player can play a mixed strategy when s / he has a linear combination ( with normalized and real coefficients ) of choosing between the two available directions as the outcomes of quantum measurements for all runs are recorded by the referee .",
    "it can be noticed that in this epr - bohm setting , instead of coins , we can let @xmath84 and @xmath1 to be alice s two directions .",
    "similarly , we can let @xmath85 and @xmath3 be bob s two directions , and , similarly , we can let @xmath17 and @xmath24 be chris two directions . as the outcome of a quantum measurement along one of the three directions is @xmath71 or @xmath70 that we have associated to the head or tail state of a coin , respectively .",
    "recall that in our six - coin setup , in a run , each player has to choose one between two coins and to inform this choice to the referee .",
    "the referee , after knowing which three coins the players have chosen in that run , tosses them together and obtains a head or tail state for each .",
    "compare this to what happens in the epr - bohm setting in which , in a run , the outcome of a quantum measurement is @xmath71 or @xmath70 , along each one of three directions chosen by the players .",
    "note that players strategies in the epr - bohm setting are same as they are when they play classical strategies using six coins .",
    "this definition of strategy serves three purposes : a ) it allows , in a straight forward fashion , a quantum version of the three - player game from the three - player classical game that is played using six coins b ) as the strategies remain identical in both the classical and the quantum games , it seems that the enk and pike s argument @xcite is avoided c ) it allows more direct exploitation of the peculiar non - factorizable quantum mechanical probabilities in terms of game - theoretic outcomes .",
    "one may ask here about the quantum state(s ) that are measured by the referee after the players inform him / her of their strategies .",
    "in fact , apart from the fact that the proposed setting uses three - partite quantum states , no further restrictions are placed telling what should be the input quantum states .",
    "that is , any pure or mixed three - partite states can be used to play the quantum game .",
    "using the above setting and noticing the notation for @xmath92 six - coin joint probabilities in ( [ 6coin probs 1]-[6coin probs 8 ] ) convinces one to introduce the same notation for @xmath92 joint probabilities corresponding to the epr - bohm setting for playing a three - player quantum game :    @xmath169    @xmath170    @xmath171    @xmath172    @xmath173    @xmath174    @xmath175    @xmath176    notice that for these coins the joint probabilities are factorizable and ( [ joint prob def 1]-[joint prob def 8 ] ) reduce to ( [ 6coin probs 1]-[6coin probs 8 ] ) .",
    "we note that quantum mechanics imposes constraints on the joint probabilities ( [ joint prob def 1]-[joint prob def 8 ] ) that are usually known @xcite as the normalization and the causal communication constraints . using the definitions ( [ joint prob def 1]-joint prob def 8) the constraints imposed by normalization are :    @xmath177    the first equation in ( [ normalization ] ) with reference to the definitions ( [ joint prob def 1 ] ) of the joint probabilities @xmath178 ,",
    "for example , describes the situation when alice , bob , and chris play @xmath0 @xmath21 and @xmath17 , respectively , over all runs . in this case",
    "the probabilities @xmath178 correspond to the outcomes @xmath179 @xmath74 @xmath73 @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath78",

    ". often these constraints are referred @xcite to as the condition of ` parameter independence ' , ` simple locality ' , ` signal locality ' , or ` physical locality ' .",
    "essentially , they say , for example , that the probability @xmath186 of alice obtaining the outcome @xmath71 when she plays @xmath84 is not changed by bob s choice for @xmath86 or @xmath187 and chris choice for @xmath17 or @xmath188 .",

    "note that the constraints ( [ constraints on joint probs ] ) assign zero value to thirty seven probabilities out of the remaining joint probabilities .",

    "note that this ne emerges because the resulting set of joint probabilities is non - factorizable and that the constraints ( constraints on joint probs ) ensure that when this set becomes factorizable this ne disappears and @xmath276 becomes the unique ne .",
    "we notice that for a given set of numbers @xmath229 @xmath224 @xmath225 @xmath277 ( each being less than @xmath228 ) not every non - factorizable set of joint probabilities can result in the strategy triplet @xmath218 being a ne .",

    "we have @xmath286 which makes these quantities non - negative and the strategy profile @xmath276 remains a ne even when the joint probabilities become non - factorizable .",
    "that is , a set of non - factorizable joint probabilities can only add to the classical ne of @xmath276 .",
    "this paper extends our probabilistic framework for playing two - player quantum games to the multiplayer case .",
    "this framework presents an argument for the construction of quantum games without referring to the tools of quantum mechanics , thus making this area more accessible to workers outside the quantum physics discipline .    where does this framework stand in front of enk and pike s criticism enkpike , which refers to the standard setting for playing a quantum game using eisert et al.s formalism ?",
    "their criticism considers a quantum game equivalent to playing another classical game in which players have access to extended set of classical strategies .",
    "this paper uses epr - bohm setting for playing quantum games in which each player has two directions , along which a measurement can be made by the referee , and his / her pure strategy , in a run , consists of choosing one direction .",
    "a mixed strategy is then defined to be the probability of playing one of his / her pure strategies . as the sets of strategies remain exactly identical in both the classical and the quantum forms of the game , it difficult to construct an enk and pike type argument @xcite for a quantum game played in the epr - bohm setting .    in the literature the wording",
    "` quantum games ' has been used in many different contexts , which involve games and quantum settings in one way or the other . in view of this",
    "the present paper comes in line with the approach towards quantum games that originated with eisert et al.s quantization of prisoner s dilemma @xcite , where they proposed a general procedure to quantize a given noncooperative two - player game .",
    "this approach is distinct , and is to be contrasted , from other approaches that also use the wording ` quantum game ' , in that it is placed in the context of classical game theory with the use of the nash equilibrium concept .",
    "for example , in some approaches both ` the game ' and its ` winning condition(s ) ' are arbitrarily defined , tailored or constructed , in order to show that only using a quantum - mechanical implementation the winning condition(s ) can be fulfilled .",
    "in contrast , this paper begins by defining payoff relations , instead of the ` winning condition(s ) ' , and then finds how game - theoretic outcome(s ) of a noncooperative game may change in relation to the quantum mechanical aspects of a probabilistic physical system , which the players share in order to play the game .",
    "the approach followed in this paper establishes a relationship between the ` classicality ' of the physical system ( expressed by the joint probabilities being factorizable ) and a ` classical game ' , in the sense that using a classical system to play a game results in the classical game .",
    "establishing this relationship allows us in the following step to find how non - classical ( thus quantum ) behavior of the physical system ( expressed by the joint probabilities being non - factorizable ) may change the outcome(s ) of the game .",
    "this paper considers very unusual non - factorizable joint probabilities , which may emerge from an entangled quantum state , by putting forward three- and six - coin setups in order to play a three - player symmetric non - cooperative game . in the six - coin setup , players choose coins in each run , not necessarily unbiased , which are subsequently tossed and the outcome of each toss is observed .",
    "this setup translates playing of the game in terms of @xmath92 joint probabilities . in the following step ,",
    "this translation of the game allows us to consider the corresponding quantum game by bringing in the same number of joint probabilities , which now may not be factorizable .",
    "we then consider how these quantum mechanical probabilities may change the nash equilibria of the game under the constraint that factorizable joint probabilities must lead to the classical solution of the game .",
    "we achieve this by re - expressing players payoffs in terms of @xmath92 joint probabilities @xmath287 , the players strategies @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath129  and the coefficients defining the game .",
    "we then use nash inequalities to find the equilibria .",
    "we find constraints on @xmath287 which ensure that for factorizable @xmath287  the game gives the classical outcome and thus it becomes interpretable as a classical mixed - strategy game .",
    "this is carried out by playing the game in the six - coin setup and using nash inequalities to obtain constraints on the coin probabilities @xmath207  @xmath208  @xmath209  @xmath288 @xmath289  @xmath117 , which reproduce the outcome of the classical mixed - strategy game .",
    "we use the relations ( 6coin probs 1-[6coin probs 8 ] ) , resulting from @xmath287 being factorizable , to translate the constraints on @xmath207  @xmath208  @xmath209  @xmath288 @xmath289  @xmath117  in terms of constraints on @xmath287 .",
    "we refer to the standard three - party epr - bohm setup and allow @xmath287  to be non - factorizable , while retaining the constraints on @xmath287 .",
    "we then ask if non - factorizability may lead to the emergence of new solution(s ) of the game . in case",
    "non - factorizability leads to new solution(s ) , given as a triplet(s ) @xmath290 there is always is a set of @xmath92 non - factorizable joint probabilities that are associated with it .",
    "our results show that non - factorizability leads to a new ne  for three - player pd that is pareto - optimal . as we recall from the ref .",
    "iqbalcheon that this does not turn out to be the case for the two - player pd and the classical ne remains intact even when the players are given access to non - factorizable probabilities . there",
    "exist , however , examples of two - player games for which non - factorizability indeed leads to new ne .",
    "the game of chicken @xcite is one such example .",
    "it seems that from a game - theoretic perspective the tri - partite quantum correlations are different and stronger relative to the bi - partite quantum correlations .",
    "recall that non - factorizability , as it is defined above , is only a necessary , but not sufficient , condition for the violation of bell s inequality .",
    "that is , a non - factorizable set of joint probabilities may not violate bell s inequality but a set of joint probabilities that violates bell s inequality must be non - factorizable .",
    "this might motivate one to ask about the exact connection between non - factorizability , entanglement , and the violation of bell s inequality .",
    "however , non - factorizability being only a necessary condition for the violation of bell s inequality seems to go in line with the known result that a separable mixed state can violate bell s inequality .",
    "the probabilistic framework towards quantum games , developed in ref .",
    "iqbalcheon and extended to multiplayer games in this paper , uses the classical concept of probability , which is well known to be more restrictive than the quantum notion @xcite .",
    "essentially , the classical concept describes ` probability '  as being a number between zero and one and that for a joint probability of two events this number is less or equal to the numbers corresponding to each of the events . though being more restrictive , as pitowski @xcite describes it , this concept is `` nevertheless rooted in some very basic intuition . ''",
    "if quantum games can be expressed in terms of this basic concept this can only be helpful to introduce this area to researchers outside the quantum domain .",
    "it is relevant here to point out that the probabilistic framework for quantum games , proposed originally for two - player games in ref .",
    "iqbalcheon and extended to three - player games in the present paper , appears close to einstein s statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the key assertion of this interpretation describes a quantum state ( pure or otherwise ) , representing an ensemble of similarly prepared systems , and need not provide a complete description of an individual system . by using coin",
    "tosses in order to translate playing of a classical game in terms of joint probabilities and subsequently introducing unusual quantum mechanical non - factorizable joint probabilities , the suggested framework uses the concept of an ensemble of similarly prepared systems .",
    "multiple coin tosses , which are central to the present framework , are found helpful in understanding how quantum mechanical predictions in quantum game theory do not pertain to a single measurement , but relate to an ensemble of similar measurements .",
