    "a precise calculation of the mass of the ground state triply - bottom baryon , @xmath2 , and ten excited positive and negative parity states with angular momentum up to @xmath3 has been recently performed in nonperturbative lattice quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) with @xmath4 flavors of dynamical light quarks in refs .",
    "the @xmath0 quark was implemented very accurately with improved lattice nonrelativistic qcd as suggested in ref .",
    "there are also recent nonperturbative calculations of the ground and excited states with angular momentum up to @xmath3 of triply - charm baryons using anisotropic lattice qcd with a background of @xmath4 dynamical light quark fields  @xcite . within the same framework of refs .",
    "@xcite , dynamical @xmath4 flavor lattice qcd and improved nonrelativistic lattice qcd for the @xmath0 quarks , the bottomonium spectrum was computed in ref .",
    "@xcite obtaining an excellent agreement with the experiment . a calculation of the charmonium spectrum with the same lattice action and the same lattice spacing used in ref .",
    "@xcite can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where one can get an idea of the typical size of the systematic uncertainties .",
    "such studies grant the lattice qcd results for the bound state problem of three - heavy quarks with the category of experimental data and thus provide us with a unique opportunity to test phenomenological quark models for baryons in the energy regime where the description using potential models is expected to work best .    as pointed out by bjorken time ago  @xcite , bound states of three - heavy quarks , @xmath5 ,",
    "may provide a new window for the understanding of baryon structure .",
    "baryons made of three - heavy quarks reveal a pure baryonic spectrum without light - quark complications and provide valuable insight into the quark - confinement mechanism as well as to elucidate our knowledge about the nature of the strong force . on the theoretical side one would expect the potential models would be able to describe triply - heavy baryons to a similar level of precision as their success in charmonium and bottomonium . in the same way the @xmath6 interactions are examined in heavy mesons ,",
    "the study of triply - heavy baryons will probe the @xmath7 interactions in the heavy quark sector .",
    "triply - heavy baryons have been studied by different methods , including quark models ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive review of quark - model theoretical approaches ) , qcd sum rules  @xcite and potential nonrelativistic qcd with static potentials from perturbation theory at leading order  @xcite and next - to - next - to - leading order  @xcite . however , no experimental results are available so far for triply - heavy baryons ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent calculation of production cross section at the lhc ) , and thus , the predictions of their properties can not yet be compared to the real world .",
    "our poor knowledge of the three - quark , @xmath8 , potential stems on the difficulty to produce @xmath5 states and , as said above , the consequent lack of experimental data .",
    "the precise calculation of the ground and excited states of triply - bottom baryons  @xcite , together with the ground and excited states of triply - charm baryons  @xcite , provide us with the ideal testbench to improve our understanding of phenomenological quark models for baryons in the heavy - quark sector .",
    "the quark - model dependent calculations could be tested by comparing them to nonperturbative first - principles calculations in lattice qcd of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 systems .",
    "an adequate starting point may be the static @xmath8 potential derived in su(3 ) lattice qcd that will be described in the next section . in sect .",
    "[ comp ] we will present our results making emphasis in the comparison between nonperturbative lattice qcd data and the results obtained with the static @xmath8 potential derived in su(3 ) lattice qcd . for this purpose we will make use of different numerical techniques for the three - body problem , generalized gaussians variational approaches , hyperspherical harmonics and faddeev equations  @xcite , to test quark - quark potential descriptions in the heavy quark limit . finally in sect .",
    "[ res ] we will briefly summarize the main conclusions of this study .",
    "since the early days of qcd the interaction among heavy quarks has been explored as an important tool to learn about the behavior of qcd at low - energies .",
    "the @xmath6 static potential has been studied extensively by lattice gauge theories  @xcite , being nowadays a very well - known quantity .",
    "the typical shape of the color - singlet @xmath11 static potential , which is characterized by a short - range coulomb behavior and a long - range linear rise , well represents the double nature of qcd as an asymptotically free and infrared confined theory . the excitation spectrum of the gluon field around a static quark - antiquark pair",
    "has also been explored by lattice calculations  @xcite . on the large length scale",
    "the spectrum agrees with that expected for stringlike excitations while in the short range it shows a coulomb - like behavior as it was first noted within the context of the static bag picture of gluon excitations  @xcite .    in qcd",
    "the three - quark potential is of prime importance reflecting the su(3 ) gauge symmetry and being directly responsible for the structure and properties of baryons , in the same way the @xmath11 potential is responsible for the meson properties .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath8 potential is a key quantity to clarify the quark confinement mechanism in baryons .",
    "however , up to now lattice qcd studies have paid relatively less attention to the potential that describes the interaction of three - heavy quarks , as a consequence of their still missing experimental evidence .",
    "thus , the @xmath8 potential is much less known than the heavy @xmath6 potential for which many lattice studies exist  @xcite . even for the ground - state ,",
    "its accurate measurement using lattice qcd is relatively difficult and has been performed recently  @xcite .",
    "the gluonic excitation ( excitations of the gluon field that are not thus of quark origin ) of the three - quark system has also been studied in su(3 ) lattice qcd  @xcite , concluding that the lowest excitation would be almost 1 gev above the ground state .",
    "this is rather large in comparison with the low - lying excitation energy of the quark origin what makes the gluonic excitation mode invisible in the low - lying excitations of baryons .",
    "thus , quark - degrees of freedom play the dominant role in low - lying baryons with excitation energy below 1 gev .",
    "this large gluonic excitation energy is conjectured to give a physical reason of the success of the quark model for low - lying baryons even without explicit gluonic modes  @xcite .",
    "most of the existing lattice studies of the three - quark static potential have mainly explored the region of large interquark distances  @xcite .",
    "as for the @xmath6 case , the characteristic signature of the long - range non - abelian dynamics is believed to be a linear rising of the static interaction .",
    "moreover , the general expectation for the baryonic case is that , at least classically , the strings meet at the so - called fermat ( or torricelli ) point , which has minimum distance from the three sources ( @xmath12shape configuration ) .",
    "if this is the case , one should see a genuine three - body interaction among the static quarks .",
    "the confining short - range @xmath8 potential could be also described as the sum of two - body potentials ( @xmath13shape configuration )  @xcite .",
    "many of the lattice calculations have focused on distinguishing the @xmath12 from the @xmath13configuration , despite the difference between a @xmath14 and a @xmath12shape potential being rather small and difficult to detect .    in recent years , according to the remarkable progress of the computational power , the lattice qcd monte carlo calculations have become a reliable and useful method for the analysis of nonperturbative qcd . in particular , the @xmath6 potential , responsible for the meson properties , has been extensively studied using lattice qcd .",
    "the data of the @xmath6 ground state potential are well reproduced by a sum of a coulomb term , due to the perturbative one - gluon exchange ( oge ) , and a linear confinement  @xcite , @xmath15 we give in table  [ tab1 ] the parameters of the @xmath6 potential taken from ref .",
    "the value of the @xmath6 confinement strength was determined to reproduce the value obtained from the linear regge trajectories of the pseudoscalar @xmath16 and @xmath17 mesons , @xmath18 ( 429@xmath192 ) mev  @xcite .",
    ".standard string tension , @xmath20 , coulomb coefficient , @xmath21 , and constant term , @xmath22 , of the static heavy quark potential obtained from su(3 ) lattice qcd taken from ref .",
    "@xcite for a lattice spacing @xmath23 0.19 fm . [ cols=\"^,<,^,<,^,<,^,<,^,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab2 ]    we have checked the validity of the @xmath13ansatz for the spectroscopy of triply - heavy baryons calculating their masses and root mean square radii by means of a simple confining interaction given either by a @xmath12shape or a @xmath13shape interaction .",
    "the @xmath12shape potential would be given by  @xcite , @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26^{1/2 } \\ , , \\ ] ] being @xmath27 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 the three sides of the @xmath8 triangle , when the angles of the @xmath8 triangle do not exceed @xmath28 .",
    "when an angle of the @xmath8 triangle exceeds @xmath28 , one gets , @xmath29 we have taken for the string tension a standard value of @xmath30 0.1648 gev@xmath31  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath13shape potential would have the form , @xmath32 with @xmath33 0.0874 gev@xmath31 .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ tab2 ] for different values of the heavy quark mass . as can be seen",
    "the two geometrical configurations give the same result with a small difference of 0.15% .",
    "if the geometrical factor in front of the @xmath13shape interaction is slightly modified , 0.55 instead of 0.53 , the @xmath12shape and the @xmath13shape results would be exactly the same .",
    "this result was already noted in ref .",
    "besides , one observes how the root - mean square radii are much smaller than the quark - quark distance for which the @xmath12 and @xmath13shapes start to slightly differ , @xmath34 0.7 fm  @xcite .",
    "+    looking for the general pattern of the results of nonperturbative lattice qcd for the @xmath9 system we have compared against the result of a single @xmath13shape confining potential or a single coulomb interaction .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in both cases",
    "we have fixed the strength of the potential to reproduce the @xmath35 mass difference correctly , obtaining @xmath36 0.2076 gev@xmath31 for the case of the single @xmath13shape confining interaction and @xmath37 0.4231 for the single coulomb potential case .",
    "we clearly note the large strength of the two interactions as compared to the predictions of su(3 ) lattice qcd ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) , where both terms would simultaneously contribute .",
    "the @xmath13shape interaction ( upper panel ) produces a splitting between the positive ( i.e. , the first excited state of @xmath38 ) and negative ( i.e. , the first excited state of @xmath39 ) parity excited states too large and a rather small excitation energy for the positive parity excitations . on the contrary , the coulomb interaction ( lower panel ) ,",
    "being an almost hypercentral potential , drives to the expected degeneracy between the positive and negative parity excited states , not observed in the nonperturbative lattice qcd results .",
    "thus , as the strength of the potential has been fixed to reproduce the @xmath35 mass difference correctly , the negative parity excited states are obtained close to the positive parity excited states in clear disagreement with the nonperturbative lattice qcd results .",
    "besides , the positive parity states ( except the first excited state of @xmath38 that has been fitted ) are predicted slightly above the nonperturbative lattice qcd results .",
    "thus , @xmath9 nonperturbative lattice qcd calculations point to a static @xmath8 potential given by a mixture of a @xmath13shape confinement and a coulomb interaction .",
    "we have therefore make use of the standard @xmath8 static potential derived from su(3 ) lattice qcd and shown in eq .",
    "( [ pot3qd ] ) with the parameters reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and quoted in table  [ tab1 ] , @xmath37 0.1410 and @xmath40 0.0925 gev@xmath31 to calculate the @xmath9 and @xmath10 spectra .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "we have fixed the mass of the heavy quark to reproduce the @xmath38 ground state of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 systems , 14.372 gev  @xcite and 4.758 gev  @xcite , respectively , obtaining @xmath41 4.655 gev and @xmath42 1.269 gev . as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , there is a large difference in the excited states with the nonperturbative lattice qcd results , predicting a small splitting between positive and negative parity excited states and also a small excitation energy for the positive parity states .",
    "these results clearly point to a lack of strength either in the confining or in the coulomb potential .",
    "+    one may think about several possible reasons for the disagreement :    * the parameters of eq .",
    "( [ pot3qd ] ) obtained in quenched qcd in ref .",
    "@xcite might be different from those in 2 + 1 flavor qcd employed in refs .",
    "@xcite . to check this possibility",
    ", one has to calculate parameters of eq .",
    "( [ pot3qd ] ) in 2 + 1 flavor qcd but such calculations do not exist so far .",
    "* results from both ref .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "@xcite contain systematic errors such as lattice artifact and chiral extrapolation as well as statistical errors .",
    "this may cause the disagreement . * the fitting form eq .",
    "( [ pot3qd ] ) , or eq .  ( [ pot3qy ] ) , might not be appropriate to describe the static three - quark potential in lattice qcd .",
    "* the static quark description might be inaccurate for @xmath9 and , in particular , for @xmath10 .",
    "higher order terms might be necessary .",
    "* the quark model description with `` 3-quark potential '' might be inappropriate for @xmath9 and @xmath10 systems .",
    "to summarize , the spectra of baryons containing three identical heavy quarks , @xmath0 or @xmath1 , have been recently calculated in nonperturbative lattice qcd .",
    "the energy of the lowest positive and negative parity excited states has been determined with high precision .",
    "these achievements constitute a unique opportunity to test phenomenological potential models in the regime where they are expected to work best .",
    "we have analyzed these results by means of static three - quark potentials derived using su(3 ) lattice qcd using different numerical techniques for the three - body problem .",
    "our results confirm the expectations of su(3 ) lattice qcd of an almost indistinguishable confining @xmath12 or @xmath13type at short distances for heavy baryons .",
    "the static three - quark potential with parameters from lattice qcd does not reproduce @xmath9 and @xmath10 spectra .    at the light of the present results a further effort to obtain a constituent quark - model potential description of the nonperturbative lattice qcd results , as has been done in the past for the heavy - meson systems  @xcite , may help in understanding the connection between static three - quark potential parameters and simple cornell - like potential descriptions .",
