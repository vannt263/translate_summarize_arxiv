    "the phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is a key to understanding not only natural phenomena such as compact stars and the early universe but also laboratory experiments such as relativistic heavy - ion collisions@xcite .",

    ", we can consider effective models such as the polyakov - loop extended nambu - jona - lasinio ( pnjl ) model @xcite . actually , some improved versions of the pnjl model yield desirable results consistent with lqcd simulations at @xmath8   @xcite .",
    "however , the model approach has still various ambiguity at large @xmath6 .    a key issue in the large @xmath6 limit , i.e. at finite @xmath1 but vanishing @xmath0 , is the eos of nuclear matter .",
    "it is one of the most important subjects in nuclear physics to understand properties of symmetric nuclear matter and neutron matter microscopically from realistic baryon - baryon interactions .",
    "various theoretical frameworks have been developed to study the subject .",
    "the results seem to be reliable because most of them are now converging a common result , but the common result can not reproduce empirical saturation properties properly if one starts with realistic two - nucleon forces ( 2nf ) .",
    "this insufficiency is probably due to the lack of including three - nucleon forces ( 3nf ) .",
    "recent development of the chiral effective field theory ( ch - eft ) @xcite provides a way of determining 2nf and 3nf systematically from symmetries of underlying qcd .",
    "although the ch - eft interaction is , by construction , to be applied at low and normal nuclear densities , the standard many - nucleon calculation using the ch - eft 2nf and 3nf at these densities should provide the predictive base for considering the neutron - matter eos at higher densities . the combination of this new constraint and the experimental constraint  @xcite evaluated from the heavy - ion collision measurements is considered to be useful to determine the nuclear - matter eos solidly .",

    "the observations on the mr relation yield a strong constraint on both the quark and hadron phases , while the nuclear - matter eos determined from the ch - eft 2nf and 3nf and the heavy - ion collision measurements does on the hadron phase .",

    "the ch - eft provides a systematic framework of constructing 2nf and 3nf , and the 3nf yields a significant effect on the eos at @xmath157 . in this sense , the use of the ch - eft , which respects symmetries of qcd , is inevitable to construct the neutron - matter eos with no ambiguity .",
    "we have determined the lower bound of the critical chemical potential of the quark - hadron transition at @xmath11 : @xmath158 this is the primary result of this work . in the njl model ,",
    "the first - order chiral transition occurs at @xmath159  gev , when @xmath11 .",
    "the point is located in the hadron phase in the hybrid model .",
    "thus , the critical chemical potential of the chiral transition at @xmath11 is unknown . in this sense ,",
    "the njl model is not good enough at @xmath11 .",
    "it is then highly required to introduce baryon degrees of freedom in the effective model .",
    "we have also shown the interplay between the heavy - ion collision physics at @xmath154 and the ns physics at @xmath155 .",
    "if the vector coupling @xmath51 is determined at @xmath154 from heavy - ion collision measurements , the information determines the critical chemical potential of the quark - hadron transition at @xmath11 and hence properties of ns in the inner core .",
    "this fact strongly suggests that these two regions should be studied simultaneously .",

    "<S> we determine the quark - hadron transition line in the whole region of temperature ( @xmath0 ) and baryon - number chemical potential ( @xmath1 ) from lattice qcd results and neutron - star mass measurements , making the quark - hadron hybrid model that is consistent with the two solid constraints . </S>",
    "<S> the quark part of the hybrid model is the polyakov - loop extended nambu - jona - lasinio ( pnjl ) model with entanglement vertex that reproduces lattice qcd results at @xmath2 , while the hadron part is the hadron resonance gas model with volume - exclusion effect that reproduces neutron - star mass measurements and the neutron - matter equation of state calculated from two- and three - nucleon forces based on the chiral effective field theory . </S>",
    "<S> the lower bound of the critical @xmath1 of the quark - hadron transition at zero @xmath0 is @xmath3 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay between the heavy - ion collision physics around @xmath4 and the neutron - star physics at @xmath5 is discussed . </S>"
