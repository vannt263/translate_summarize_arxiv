    "the origin of the observed large - scale magnetic fields of order @xmath8 found in nearly all galaxies and galaxy clusters is still largely unknown .",
    "it is generally believed that the galactic magnetic field develops by some form of amplification from a pre - galactic cosmological magnetic field .",
    "the two popular formation scenarios that are considered are either some exponential dynamo mechanism which amplifies a very small seed field of order @xmath9 as the galaxy evolves , or the adiabatic collapse of a larger existing cosmological field of order @xmath10 .",
    "there are a number of pros and cons to both scenarios .",
    "see @xcite for reviews on the subject .",
    "theories explaining the origin of this primordial magnetic ( pmf ) field are still highly speculative .",
    "it has been suggested that a large - scale magnetic field could be produced during inflation if the conformal invariance of the electromagnetic field is broken ; see for example @xcite or more recently @xcite .    to date , there is no astrophysical evidence for the existence of a large - scale cosmological magnetic field , and only upper bounds on its magnitude have been derived .",
    "so far the strongest constraints have come from measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and big - bang nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "the cmb bounds are derived by considering the effects of faraday rotation induced by the pmf on the cmb power spectra . in @xcite",
    "an upper limit in the range @xmath11 to @xmath12 was derived for the mean - field amplitude of the pmf at a comoving length scale of @xmath13 by comparison to the wmap 5-year data .",
    "more recent work @xcite analysing the wmap data in combination with other cmb experiments such as acbar , cbi and quad have placed tighter constraints on the amplitude of the pmf with an upper bound on the mean - field amplitude at @xmath13 of @xmath14",
    ".    the existence of a primordial magnetic field would induce mixing between cmb photons and axion - like particles ( alps ) .",
    "alps refer collectively to any very light scalar or pseudo - scalar with a linear coupling to @xmath15 or @xmath16 respectively . in this paper",
    "we consider non - resonant mixing of scalar alps and cmb photons , with specific reference to the chameleon scalar field model @xcite .",
    "standard alps have constant mass and photon - scalar coupling everywhere , while the chameleon model has a density dependent mass . in sparse environments , such as",
    "the primordial plasma , the chameleon acts as a very light scalar field and would be indistinguishable from a standard scalar alp .",
    "however in dense environments the chameleon is very heavy and evades the standard alp constraints @xcite .",
    "the current best constraints on the coupling strength between the chameleon and electromagnetic fields are : @xmath17 @xcite and @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "other chameleon - like theories exist such as the olive - pospelov model @xcite which have a density - dependent coupling strength , but we do not discuss these further here .",
    "the resonant mixing of photons with scalar and pseudo - scalar alps in a primordial magnetic field has been analysed by mirizzi , redondo and sigl @xcite .",
    "they find a constraint on the combined magnetic field strength , @xmath19 , and alp - photon coupling strength , @xmath20 : @xmath21 , for alp masses between @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we believe that these results will not necessarily be applicable to the chameleon because its mass evolves as the density of the universe decreases .    in the following analysis",
    "we assume a stochastic primordial magnetic field with a power - law power spectrum , similar to the treatment in @xcite .",
    "we assume fluctuations in the magnetic field are damped on small scales due to alfv@xmath24n wave dissipation @xcite , and subdivide the magnetic field into multiple domains of length @xmath25 of a comparable size to just above the alfv@xmath24n wave damping scale @xmath26 . the magnetic field in each domain",
    "is assumed to be approximately constant , and correlated to the other domains according to the magnetic power spectrum .",
    "a similar method was applied to correlations in quasar polarization spectra by agarwal , kamal and jain @xcite .",
    "the degree of conversion between chameleons and photons in a magnetic field is inversely proportional to the electron density in the plasma @xcite .",
    "hence the dominant contribution to photon - scalar mixing will take place in the region after recombination when the ionization fraction drops significantly and before reionization .",
    "this greatly simplifies the mixing equations because we do not need to evolve the photon - scalar mixing equations through the last scattering surface , nor include the density inhomogeneities present after reionization .",
    "we model a scenario in which the primary cmb is formed at the last scattering surface and then evolves through a primordial magnetic field extending from recombination ( @xmath27 ) to the epoch of reionization ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ chameleon_model ] the chameleon model is introduced and the calculations describing photon - scalar mixing in a magnetic field , living in a friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) spacetime , are presented . the power spectrum of the primordial magnetic field is discussed in more detail in section [ magnetic_field ] . in section [ evolution ]",
    "we analyse the evolution of the photon and chameleon states as they propagate through the multiple magnetic domains , and predict the average modification to the cmb intensity and polarization . in section [ experiment ] , our predictions are compared to precision measurements of the cmb monopole made by the far infrared absolute spectrophotometer ( firas ) on board the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) satellite .",
    "we present a summary of the work and our conclusions in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the appendix contains details of the equations governing the evolution of the cmb stokes parameters .",
    "the chameleon scalar field has been suggested as a candidate for the dark energy quintessence field @xcite .",
    "standard quintessence scalar fields have coupling strengths to matter which are unnaturally fine - tuned to very low values so as to be compatible with fifth - force experiments . by contrast the chameleon model is constructed so that the chameleon can have a gravitational strength ( or greater ) coupling to normal matter while at the same time evading fifth - force constraints .",
    "this is achieved by introducing a density - dependent term in the effective potential of the chameleon , which causes a change to the minimum of the potential depending on the density of the surrounding matter . in sparse environments",
    "the chameleon behaves as an effectively massless scalar field while in a laboratory on earth it is much heavier and evades detection .",
