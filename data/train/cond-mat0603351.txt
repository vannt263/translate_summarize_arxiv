    "the behavior of hydrophobic - polar ( hp ) copolymers at a selective penetrable interface ( the interface which divides two immiscible liquids , like water and oil , each of them being favored by one of the two types of monomers ) is of great importance in the chemical physics of polymers . for strongly selective interfaces , when the energy gain for a monomer in the favored solvent is large , the hydrophobic and polar blocks of a copolymer chain try to stay on different sides of the interface leading thus to a major reduction of the interfacial tension between the immiscible liquids or melts which has important technological applications , e.g. for compatilizers , thickeners or emulsifiers .",
    "not surprisingly , during the last two decades the problem has gained a lot of attention from experiment @xcite , theory @xcite as well as from computer experiment @xcite .",
    "while in earlier studies attention has been mostly focused on diblock copolymers @xcite due to their relatively simple structure , the scientific interest shifted later to _ random _ hp - copolymers at penetrable interfaces @xcite .",
    "until recently though , the properties of regular multiblock copolymers , especially with emphasis on their _ dependence on block length _",
    "@xmath1 , have remained largely unexplored .",
    "this has been a driving force for our research , since experimentalists are now able to synthesize polymers with an increased variety of controlled structures .    in a recent study @xcite",
    ", we showed that the equilibrium properties ( structure , diffusion coefficient , etc . ) of a regular hp - copolymer at a selective liquid - liquid interface are well described by a scaling theory in terms of the total copolymer length @xmath0 ( the number of repeating units in the chain ) and the block size @xmath1 ( the number of consecutive monomers of the same kind ) as well as the selectivity parameter @xmath7 , that is , the energy gained by a monomer when being in the more favorable solvent .    in terms of the selectivity parameter",
    ", there are three adsorption regimes that can be distinguished :    * if @xmath7 is smaller than a critical value @xmath8 , the interface is too _ weak _ to affect the polymer at all so that the macromolecule conformation is identical to that in the absence of an interface ; * for @xmath9 the polymer starts to feel the presence of the interface so that the coil radius perpendicular to the interface starts to shrink while parallel to the interface this radius swells . in this regime",
    "the scaling approach developed in @xcite correctly describes the statics of the problem .",
    "this regime is labeled as of _ weak localization _ ; * if @xmath7 is increased furthermore , a second threshold value @xmath10 is reached .",
    "this value corresponds to an interface that is strong enough to induce a _",
    "perfect flattening _ of the copolymer in which all the monomers are in their preferred environment . in this regime of",
    "_ strong localization _ , an increase in @xmath7 does not change the shape of the polymer anymore since the polymer is already in equilibrium , as flat as it can get , depending on its structure , mainly on the length of the blocks .    using scaling arguments , we demonstrated @xcite that : ( i ) the crossover selectivity decreases with growing block length as @xmath11 ( where @xmath3 is the flory exponent in three dimensions ) and the threshold to the strong localization regime vanishes as @xmath12 , and ( ii ) the size of the copolymer varies in the weak localization regime as @xmath13 and @xmath14 , whereas @xmath15 in the case of strong localization ( where @xmath16 is the flory exponent in two dimensions ) .",
    "we shall use these results in the present paper in which we suggest a theory of the localization kinetics of a regular block copolymer at a liquid - liquid interface based on dynamical scaling arguments . to the best of our knowledge , so far there have been no attempts to treat this problem analytically or by means of computer simulation .",
    "in our _ dynamical scaling analysis _ we consider a coarse - grained model of a multiblock copolymer consisting of @xmath0 repeat units which is built up from a sequence of h- and p - blocks each of length @xmath1 .",
    "for simplicity one may take the interface with negligible thickness as a flat plane which separates the two selective immiscible solvents .",
    "the energy gain of each repeat unit is thus @xmath17 , provided it stays in its preferred solvent , and the system is considered in the _",
    "strong localization _",
    "limit where @xmath18 @xcite . in our consideration , we skip the time needed by the polymer to move by diffusion through the bulk into the vicinity of the interface , and place the center of mass of an unperturbed coil at time @xmath19 at the interface whereby the localization field is switched on",
    ". the initial coil will then start relaxing with time into a flat ( `` pancake '' ) equilibrium configuration in - plane with the interface and the kinetics of relaxation will be determined by the sum of the various forces acting on the copolymer .",
    "it might be argued that a more _ physical _ initial configuration could be represented by a polymer that , after diffusing in the bulk of one of the solvents , gets to the interface and touches it with one single monomer .",
    "we have indeed tried this initial configuration as well , and concluded that , once the adsorption process starts , it proceeds exhibiting the same physics ( e.g. the same scaling behavior , see section 4.1 ) .",
    "the choice of our initial condition just eliminates the spread in the initial time at which adsorption sets on .",
    "this spread is caused by polymers which occasionally drift away from the interface , provided the coil touches the interface initially with the `` wrong '' kind of p- or h - monomers .      in order to estimate the driving force of the flattening process",
    ", one may recall @xcite that the effective attractive energy @xmath20 ( per diblock , e.g. a pair of consecutive blocks of h- and p- monomers ) in the strong localization limit is @xmath21 . in this case",
    "the diblock plays the role of a blob and the overall attractive free energy @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the total number of blobs .",
    "thus the effective driving force perpendicular to the interface is @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the perpendicular component of the radius of gyration .",
    "this force is opposed by a force of confinement due to the deformation of the self - avoiding chain into a layer of thickness @xmath26 .",
    "the corresponding free energy of deformation is simply estimated as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the kuhn segment size @xcite .",
    "for the respective force then one gets @xmath29 .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath25 follows from the condition that the friction force which the chain experiences during the motion in the direction perpendicular to the interface is balanced by the sum of @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in the case of rouse dynamics ,",
    "each chain segment experiences independent stokes friction so that the resulting equation of motion has the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the friction coefficient per segment .    during the flattening process",
    ", the chain spreads parallel to the interface due to the excluded volume interaction . within flory mean - field arguments , the corresponding free energy @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the second virial coefficient and @xmath36 is the gyration radius component parallel to the interface . the corresponding driving force is @xmath37 .",
    "this term is counterbalanced by the elastic force of chain deformation , i.e. by @xmath38 .",
    "taking into account the balance of forces in the parallel direction , the equation of motion for @xmath36 takes then the following form @xmath39 evidently , the excluded volume interactions provide a coupling between the relaxation perpendicular and parallel to the interface .",
    "thus , eqs .",
    "( [ eq_motion_perp ] ) and ( [ eq_motion_parallel ] ) describe the relaxation kinetics of a multiblock copolymer conformation at a selective liquid - liquid interface .",

    "the relaxation of @xmath69 looks somewhat slower and , as our data for longer chains show , this effect becomes much more pronounced with growing number of blocks .",

    "first of all , our expressions for the attractive free energy , @xmath70 , and the confinement free energy , @xmath71 , are only appropriate in the limit of strong flattening which occurs during the late stages of the localization process .",
    "moreover , the free energy @xmath72 , due to excluded volume interactions , is somewhat underestimated if one uses the second virial term approximation only .",
    "that explains why both analytic curves in fig .",
    "[ analyt_vs_mc ] qualitatively agree well with the simulation data at the late stages of the relaxation process whereas , not surprisingly , this agreement is missing during its initial stages .      in the case of zimm dynamics , the hydrodynamic long - ranged interactions couple the motion of the solvent to that of the coil within the framework of the non - draining coil model @xcite .",
    "when the coil flattens , the solvent velocity @xmath73 follows the velocity of the coil segments ( the solvent entrainment ) , as depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ zimmpicture ] . in order to calculate the friction forces which act during the coil flattening , we recall that the energy dissipation in an incompressible fluid is @xcite : @xmath74 where @xmath73 is the solvent velocity field , @xmath75 is the viscosity , and the integral is taken over the interior of the coil . in our case",

    "this is due to the strong coupling between perpendicular and horizontal degrees of freedom induced by the solvent .",
    "in addition , compared to the case of rouse dynamics , the localization in the presence of hydrodynamic effects takes considerably longer , at least one order of magnitude , under otherwise identical conditions .",
    "the physical reason for this slowing down is the presence of high velocity gradients which develop in the incompressible solvent during the coil flattening .",

    "careful inspection of the figure reveals that the value of @xmath217 is almost twice larger than that of the bulk case shown in fig .",

    "another striking difference in comparison to the results observed for the parallel components , can be seen in fig .",
    "[ rouse_inter_perp]b .",
    "the modes are _ not orthogonal _ to each other anymore since the quantities @xmath219 , corresponding to @xmath220 up to @xmath221 , are non - zero and of the same order of magnitude as @xmath222 . thus one can conclude that the odd - numbered modes are coupled to one another .",

    "another observation concerns the _ average values _ of the perpendicular components of the rouse modes . if one calculates @xmath223 or @xmath224 , then due to the isotropy of the system in the plane of the interface these values vanish for all @xmath209 s because there is no preferential orientation in the plane .",

    "one may therefore conclude that the observed behavior of the rouse modes for the chains adsorbed at the interface is indeed a consequence of the interplay between the interface and the regular block structure of the polymers under investigation .",

    "the dashed line represents the expected theoretical dependence of @xmath232 on @xmath209 as @xmath233 .",
    "as it can be easily observed , the results of the simulations follow the theoretical prediction quite nicely . as in the case of the amplitude of the rouse modes",
    ", one observes deviations from the predicted law when the condition @xmath234 does not hold anymore .",
    "we compare the results for the chain in the bulk to the respective results for chains localized at the interface . in fig .",
    "[ rouse_decay](a ) , we consider the components parallel to the interface",
    ". apparently the presence of the interface does not affect the relaxation time @xmath235 considerably .",
    "evidently , the times @xmath235 for the chain at the interface are shorter than those for the chain in the bulk so that the presence of the interface effectively speeds up the inplane dynamics . in fig .",
    "[ rouse_decay](b ) , instead , the bulk behavior is compared to the behavior of the perpendicular component at the interface . in this case the times @xmath235 corresponding to small values of @xmath209 change more significantly .",
    "the presence of the interface accelerates the relaxation of the modes that are characterized by large wavelengths ( small values of @xmath209 ) since then the chain can better `` sense '' the interface .",
    "having understood the impact of block structure on copolymer localization kinetics , it is tempting to contrast it to the case of _ random _ hp - copolymers and the rate of their flattening onto a liquid - liquid interface . in recent years",
    "there has been a number of studies of random copolymers both by analytical theory @xcite as well as by means of computer simulation @xcite . as a rule ,",
    "all these studies focus on the static conformational properties of random copolymers at the penetrable interfaces between two solvents .",
    "thus it is now well established @xcite that the perpendicular component of the gyration radius @xmath236 of a random copolymer should scale with the degree of interface selectivity as a function of @xmath237 for small and moderately large values of the interface selectivity @xmath7 .    in order to determine the crossover selectivity @xmath238 in our model , we carried out simulations on random copolymers with length @xmath184 and the results may be seen in the scaling plot of fig .",

    "one may estimate from the master curve in fig .",
    "[ random ] that @xmath239 . the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ random ] shows the predicted @xcite dependence of the perpendicular component of the radius of gyration on the scaling variable @xmath240 in the weak localization regime .",
    "as extensively explained elsewhere @xcite , the scaling is expected to fail when @xmath7 is very large because then the blob size reaches its minimum possible value corresponding to a single block .",
    "mathematically , the scaling fails for large values of the selectivity because of the different normalization factors used for the different curves as @xmath241 depends of course on @xmath0 .",
    "we have also checked another scaling hypothesis put forward for the first time in @xcite : the total polymer density in the region of the interface should scale with @xmath242 when @xmath7 lies within the limits of the weak localization regime : @xmath243\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath244 is the density of @xmath245 monomers at a distance @xmath246 from the interface , where @xmath247 is the position of the interface ( @xmath248 in our simulations ) , @xmath249 is the corresponding quantity for the @xmath250 monomers , @xmath251 is the total monomer density at the interface , and @xmath252 is a function close to being exponential .",
    "[ rand_dens ] demonstrates that this scaling law is indeed observed for a wide range of polymer lengths and interface strength values .",
    "also in the case of random copolymers , we performed all our studies of the localization kinetics in the limit of strong localization .",
    "it can be easily proved that , in the limit of infinite chain length , the average block size in a random copolymer is @xmath253 . in the case of polymers with finite length , there are finite - size corrections that have to be taken into account @xcite : the average block size is then always smaller than @xmath254 , albeit very close to this value , so it is appropriate to compare the rate of flattening of random copolymers to that of a multiblock copolymer with block size @xmath255 at the same selectivity strength @xmath256 . the results for the flattening dynamics of random copolymers are compared to those for regular block copolymers in figures [ tau_early ] to [ tau_parall ] where the results corresponding to the random copolymers are represented by filled symbols . in these figures it is possible to notice a marked difference between the early stage and the late stage dynamics . as seen in fig .",
    "[ tau_early]a , the values of @xmath167 for the random copolymers and the corresponding block copolymers are very close for small values of @xmath0 .",
    "as @xmath0 increases , however , the difference between these two values grows as well and is particularly large in the limiting case of @xmath257 when the characteristic time for the random copolymer is about twice as large as the value for the corresponding block copolymer . a careful inspection of fig .",
    "[ tau_early]a shows that the value of @xmath167 for a random copolymer with @xmath257 is similar to that of a regular block copolymer of the _ same _ total length and a considconsiderablyr block size @xmath170 .",
    "the trend shown by the simulation results as the length of the polymers increases can be easily understood through a careful analysis of the nature of the random sequences that can be created in a polymer of finite length @xcite : when the polymer length is short , e.g. @xmath258 , the probability of generating sequences of consecutive like monomers much longer than @xmath254 is extremely small . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the polymer will almost always contain a sequence of @xmath259 and @xmath260 monomers in which the length of each segment is small since every single polymer used to run the simulation is prepared in a _",
    "neutral _ state with as many @xmath260 as @xmath259monomers . on the contrary , when a very long polymer is generated ,",
    "the probability of having longer sequences of consecutive @xmath259 or @xmath260 monomers is increased .",
    "a long random copolymer will likely have long sequences of like monomers at some point along the chain .",
    "these long sequences are responsible for the much faster adsorption kinetics as compared to that of the regular block copolymers .",
    "the presence of long sequences of like monomers along the chain apparently affects only the early stages of the localization dynamics : from figures [ tau_late]a and [ tau_parall]a it can be observed that during the late stages of the adsorption process , the behavior of random copolymers is almost identical to that of the corresponding regular block copolymers with @xmath255 .",
    "this observtiobservationunderstood by considering that during the late stages of adsorption the long blocks that are present in the random copolymers have already been adsorbed at the interface and it is the remaining short blocks that drive the system in order to complete the adsorption process . during this stage",
    "it is then the shortest blocks that are important for the adsorption process , and in this respect the random copolymers are very similar to the regular blocky ones , with blocks of length equal to @xmath254 .",
    "from the results presented above , it appears that the simple scaling theory that we have developed to describe the kinetics of copolymer adsorption on a selective liquid - liquid interface is able to capture quite well the most salient features of the problem as a comparison with extensive mc simulation data demonstrates .",
    "the agreement between the predictions of the model and the results of the simulations in both limits of early and late stages of adsorption is remarkable especially for long polymer and block lengths .",
    "the analysis that we have carried out regarding the rouse modes of the system indicates that polymer chains that are strongly absorbed at the interface behave as two dimensional random walks in the plane of the interface , and show almost no fluctuations in the direction perpendicular to the interface . a simple trial function for the shape of the chain in the direction perpendicular to the interface is sufficient to capture the features of the modes that are specific to the adsorbed chains .",
    "finally , we have also shown how the random copolymers behave at the interface .",
    "in particular , we have been able to prove how the presence of long blocks in the random sequences of the polymer chains affecs maffectsthe early stages of adsorption while the behavior of the random chains in the late stages of adsorption is almost identical to that of regular block copolymers with @xmath255 , as expected .",
    "although the present study deals with the simplest situation of symmetric interface selectivity and copolymer composition and it assumes equal viscosity of both immiscible liquids , it can be viewed as a first step in exploring the localization kinetics of copolymers at the liquid - liquid interface .",
    "we also believe that our results could stimulate exciting laboratory experiments and be tested , for example , by means of the method of videomicroscopy of single macromolecules@xcite .",
