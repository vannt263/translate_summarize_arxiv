    "the inverse source problem arises from many scientific and industrial areas such as antenna synthesis , biomedical imaging , and photo - acoustic tomography @xcite . as specific examples in medical imaging such as magnetoencephalography , electroencephalography , electroneurography , these imaging modalities are non - invasive neurophysiological techniques that measure the electric or magnetic fields generated by neuronal activity of the brain @xcite .",
    "the spatial distributions of the measured fields are analyzed to localize the sources of the activity within the brain to provide information about both the structure and function of the brain .",
    "in addition , the inverse source problem has been considered as a basic mathematical tool for the solution of reflection tomography , diffusion - based optical tomography , lidar imaging for chemical and biological threat detection , and fluorescence microscopy @xcite .    motivated by these significant applications , the inverse source problem , as an important research subject in inverse scattering theory , has been extensively studied by many researchers @xcite .",
    "a lot of information is available concerning its solution .",
    "although the inverse source problem is a linear problem , there are many issues .",
    "it is known that there is no uniqueness for the inverse source problem at a fixed frequency due to the existence of non - radiating sources @xcite .",
    "therefore , addition information are needed for the source in order to obtain a unique solution to the problem , such as to seek the minimum energy solution @xcite . from the computational aspect ,",
    "a more serious issue is the lack of stability .",
    "a small variation of the data may lead to a huge error in the reconstruction .",
    "recently , it has been realized that the use of multi - frequency data is an effective approach to overcome the difficulties of non - uniqueness and instability which are presented at a single frequency .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the study of the inverse source problem by using multiple frequency information .",
    "a topic review can be found in @xcite on the inverse source problem and many other inverse scattering problems by using multiple frequencies to enhance stability .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors initialized the mathematical study on the stability of the inverse source problem for the helmholtz equation by using multi - frequency data .",
    "the increasing stability was studied in @xcite for the inverse source problem of the three - dimensional helmholtz equation . based on the huygens principle",
    ", the method assumes a special form of the source function , and requires both the dirichlet and neumann boundary data .",
    "a different approach was developed in @xcite to obtain the same increasing stability result for both the two- and three - dimensional helmholtz equation .",
    "the method removes the assumption on the source function and requires the dirichlet data only .",
    "an attempt was made in @xcite to extend the stability result to the inverse random source of the one - dimensional stochastic helmholtz equation .",

    "related results can be found in @xcite on the increasing stability in the solution of the cauchy problem for the acoustic and electromagnetic wave equations .",
    "although many work have been done on the inverse source problem for acoustic waves , little is known on the inverse source problem for elastic and electromagnetic waves , especially their stability . in @xcite , the authors discussed the uniqueness and non - uniqueness of maxwell s equations , which is the only available mathematical result so far . in this paper , we develop a unified theory to address the stability in the inverse source problem for time - harmonic elastic and electromagnetic scattering , where the wave propagation is governed by the navier equation and maxwell s equations , respectively .",
    "the elastic and electromagnetic wave scattering problems have received ever - increasing attention from both the engineering and mathematical communities @xcite , due to their significant applications in diverse scientific areas such as geophysics , seismology , elastography , and optics .    for elastic waves ,",
    "the inverse source problem is to determine the external force that produces the measured displacement .",
    "we show that the increasing instability can be achieved by using the dirichlet boundary data only at multiple frequencies . for electromagnetic waves",
    ", the inverse source problem is to reconstruct the electric current density from the tangential trace of the electric field .",
    "first we discuss the uniqueness of the problem and distinguish the detectable radiating sources from non - radiating sources .",
    "then we prove that the increasing stability can be obtained to reconstruct the radiating electric current densities from the boundary measurement at multiple frequencies .",
    "for each wave , we give the stability estimates for both the continuous frequency data and the discrete frequency data .",
    "the estimates consist of two parts : the first part is the lipschitz type of data discrepancy and the second part is the high frequency tail of the source function .",
    "the former is analyzed via the green tensor .",
    "the latter is estimated by the analytical continuation , and it decreases as the frequency of the data increases .",
    "the results explain that the inverse source problem becomes more stable as higher frequency is used for the data . in our analysis ,",
    "the main ingredients are to use the transparent boundary conditions and green s tensors for the wave equations .",
    "the transparent boundary condition establishes the relationship between the dirichlet data and the neumann data .",
    "the neumann data can not only be represented in terms of the dirichlet data , but also be computed once the dirichlet data is available in practice .",
    "this work initializes the mathematical study and provides the first stability results on the inverse source problem for elastic and electromagnetic wave .",
    "it significantly extends the approach developed in @xcite to handle the more complicated navier and maxwell equations .",
    "apparently , more careful study are needed for sophisticated green s tensors of these two wave equations .",
    "the results shed light on the stability analysis of the more challenging nonlinear inverse medium scattering problem @xcite .",
    "in addition , they motivate us to study the time - domain inverse problem where all frequencies are available in order to have better stability @xcite .        throughout , we assume that the source of either the external force or the electric current density has a compact support @xmath0 , @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we show the increasing stability in the inverse source problem for elastic waves . section 3 is devoted to the inverse source problem for electromagnetic waves .",
    "the uniqueness is discussed and the increasing stability is obtained .",
    "in both sections , the analysis is carried for continuous frequency data and then followed by the discussion for the discrete frequency data .",
    "the paper is concluded with some general remarks and future work in section 4 . to make the paper easily accessible",

    "given the dirichlet data @xmath20 on @xmath43 , @xmath46 can be viewed as the neumann data .",
    "it follows from that the neumann data can be computed via the dtn operator @xmath44 once the dirichlet data is available on @xmath43 .",
    "hence we may just define a boundary measurement in terms of the dirichlet data only : @xmath47 let the external force @xmath48 be a complex function with the compact support @xmath49 .",
    "the inverse source problem is to determine @xmath48 from the displacement @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a constant .",

    "<S> this paper concerns the stability in the inverse source problem for time - harmonic elastic and electromagnetic waves , which is to determine the external force and the electric current density from the boundary measurement of the radiated wave field , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a unified theory to show that the increasing stability can be achieved to reconstruct the external force of the navier equation and the radiating electric current density of maxwell s equations for either the continuous frequency data or the discrete frequency data . the stability estimates consist of the lipschitz type data discrepancy and the high frequency tail of the source functions which decreases as the frequency increases . </S>",
    "<S> the results explain that the inverse source problem becomes more stable when higher frequency data is used . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis uses the transparent boundary conditions and green s tensors for the wave equations , and requires the dirichlet boundary data only at multiple frequencies . </S>"
