    "in the past decade , there have been many revelations of the importance of non - coding rnas to cellular regulatory functions and thus a growing interest in computational prediction of rna tertiary structure @xcite , @xcite . nevertheless , rna tertiary structure prediction from a single rna sequence is a significant challenge .",
    "one major unresolved issue is in the immense space of tertiary conformations even for a short rna sequence .",
    "existing methods usually employ random sampling algorithms for computation feasibility , which assemble sampled tertiary motifs into native - like structures @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . to reduce the chance to miss native structures ,",
    "the assembly algorithms have mostly been guided with constraining structural models .",
    "for example , mc - fold / mc - sym @xcite assumes the tertiary structure consists of 4-nt cyclic tertiary motifs constructible from the predicted secondary structure .",
    "rosetta @xcite _ de novo _ assembles tertiary structure from a database of 3-nt tertiary fragments .",
    "other methods follow samplings that preserve the secondary structure @xcite , @xcite or intervention from human experts @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , these constraining models do not necessarily ensure that native conformations are examined .",
    "in particular , the state - of - the - art methods have yet to deliver the desired prediction accuracy for rna sequences of lengths beyond 50 @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we introduce a novel method to predict nucleotide interactions from sequences as a key step toward accurate _",
    "ab initio _ prediction of tertiary structure .",
    "accurate knowledge of the nucleotide interactions is crucial to predicting the tertiary structure of an rna and subsequently predicting its functional roles .",
    "to predict nucleotide interactions , our method is guided by a novel graph model called a _",
    "backbone @xmath0-tree _ , for small integer @xmath0 , to globally constrain the nucleotide interaction relationships ( nirs ) that constitute the tertiary structure .",
    "in such a @xmath0-tree graph , nucleotides are organized into groups of size @xmath1 , such that nirs are permitted only for nucleotides belonging to the same group and groups are connected to each other with a tree topology ( see section 2 ) .",
    "this model was inspired by our recent discovery of the small treewidth of the nir graphs for more than 3,500 rna chains extracted from 1,984 resolved rnas ( figure 1 ) .",
    "we have been able to develop dynamic programming algorithms with @xmath2 time and space complexities , efficient for small @xmath0 , to compute the optimal backbone @xmath0-tree spanning over the nucleotides on the query sequence , given a scoring function @xcite        to ensure that the computed optimal @xmath0-tree can actually yield the set of nucleotide interactions that constitutes the native tertiary structure , our method defines the scoring function over detailed patterns of nucleotide interactions within every group of @xmath1 nucleotides .",
    "we consider nucleotide interactions from the established geometric nomenclatures @xcite and nucleotide interaction families @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , including base - base , base - phosphate , and base - ribose as well as base - stacking interactions . to test our method",
    ", we adopted an improved 3-tree model and pre - computed candidates of interaction patterns for every group of 4 nucleotides , by searching through rna structure atlas @xcite ; this contains annotated atom - level nucleotide interactions for nearly 3,000 resolved tertiary structures .",
    "we trained artificial neural networks ( anns ) to compute the confidence of every given nucleotide interaction and the confidence of every admissible nucleotide interaction pattern for every group of 4 given nucleotides .",
    "we filtered out unlikely interaction patterns and kept only those with high confidences . with this 3-tree model",
    ", our algorithm efficiently predicts an optimal set of nucleotide interactions from the query sequence within computational time @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a constant and @xmath5 is the maximum number of candidate interaction patterns for one group of 4 nucleotides .",
    "we have implemented the algorithm into a program called bktree , which may use known or predicted canonical ( i.e. , _ cis _ watson - crick ) base pairs on the query sequence .    to evaluate our method for nucleotide interaction prediction , we tested bktree on a benchmark set of 43 high resolution rnas , which had been used to survey a number of state - of - the - art tertiary structure prediction methods @xcite .",
    "the resolved , atom - level interactions were extracted with fr3d @xcite .",
    "bktree performed impressively well across the set of tested rnas ( table  [ withbbstable ] ) , achieving the averaged sensitivity , ppv , and mcc values of 0.86 , 0.78 , and 0.82 , respectively ( discounting the input canonical base pairs ) . in comparison with previous programs",
    "mc @xcite , rosetta @xcite , and nast @xcite that all assumed the secondary structure as a part of the input @xcite , it is clear that bktree outperformed the other three programs in the mcc measure on this set of benchhmark rnas ( table  [ avg4methods ] , figure  [ laingmcccompare ] ) .",
    "in particular , on the four representative rnas that contain typical helices and junctions @xcite , bktree gave the best performance on all but one rna , for which bktree acquired a higher sensitivity value but lower ppv than the mc program , resulting in a slightly lower mcc value ( table  [ compare_laing ] ) .",
    "to evaluate the significance of our method to 3d conformation prediction , we used the program mc - sym to model 3d conformations from the interactions predicted by bktree and calculated rmsds against the resolved structures .",
    "since mc - sym requires secondary structure for 3d conformation modeling , we identified 30 rnas from the benchmark set for which their secondary structures are covered by the bktree - predicted nucleotide interactions together with its input canonical base pairs .",
    "for the 4 representative rnas listed in table  [ compare_laing ] , bktree outperforms mc and rosetta on 3 of them .",
    "in this work , we consider all known types of nucleotide interactions of atomic - resolution @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in particular , with the base triangle model consisting of watson - crick ( w ) , hoogsteen ( h ) , and sugar ( s ) edges , base - base interactions has been fully characterized into rich 12 geometric types and 18 interaction families @xcite , @xcite , according to involved edges , _ cis _ or _ trans _ , and parallel or anti - parallel , observed in crystal structures .",
    "for example the cww family contains , in addition to the canonical ( i.e. , _ cis _ watson - crick ) base pairs , many non - canonical base - base interactions through w edges .",
    "more recently , classifications of nucleotide interactions have been extended to base - backbone interactions .",
    "there are 10 families identified for base - phosphate interactions based on the position of the interacting hydrogen atom in the base @xcite .",
    "similarly , 9 additional families have been identified for base - ribose interactions @xcite .",
    "a few base stacking interactions have also been classified .",
    "table 1 summarizes these classes of nucleotide interactions , which also includes the backbone interaction between two neighboring nucleotides .",
    ".categories , types and families of rna nucleotide interactions , mostly summarized from works @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it also includes the phosphodiester interaction between two neighboring nucleotides . [ cols=\"^,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ compare_laing ]",
    "our method is the first to _ ab initio _ predict rna non - canonical interactions of all types .",
    "evaluation of the results have highlighted its potential as an important step toward accurate _",
    "ab initio _",
    "3d structure prediction .",
    "we attribute the encouraging preliminary results to the recent growth of knowledge in high - resolution nucleotide interaction data as well as to the novel backbone @xmath0-tree modeling of nucleotide interaction relationships .",
    "the latter makes it possible to markedly reduce the space of solutions for the nucleotide interaction prediction problem to one that can be feasibly searched in polynomial time .",
    "our method differs from others also in its direct prediction of nucleotide interactions whereas the others mostly attempt 3d conformation construction before producing nucleotide interactions .",
    "the difference makes it difficult to compare their performances , especially when a 3d structure is not the direct output of a software , e.g. , rna - moip @xcite .",
    "therefore , the mcc comparison with mc was probably more appropriate than the comparison with rna - moip , since the results of mc were based on interactions from the rna structure atlas and so did bktree , while rna - moip used interaction network fidelity @xcite in calculating the mcc values .",
    "the contrast is more evident when using mc - sym to model 3d conformations from interaction data predicted by bktree .",
    "even though the predicted base - phosphate and base - ribose interactions have to be discarded , the resulted rmsds seem to correlate with the mcc values ( table  [ compare_laing ] ) .",
    "the evaluation tests have also revealed some issues with bktree .",
    "first , the complexity of structures has an impact on our prediction results .",
    "typically , bktree underperformed on some of the rnas with pseudoknots or 4-way junctions .",
    "table  [ compare_laing ] shows that bktree loses to mc on mcc value for only one representative rna 2qus , which contains a pseudoknot .",
    "the underperformance is likely due to the 3-tree model that is a little too weak for complex structures .",
    "for example , the best 3-tree can include at most 83 interactions out of total 95 interactions of trna 2du3 , indicating a higher treewidth is needed for the nir graph of this rna . to improve prediction performance for such rnas",
    ", an algorithm may need to be based on the backbone @xmath6-tree model .",
    "our method is not ineffective for handling multi - way junctions or pseudoknots , e.g. , rna 2gis in table [ withbbstable ] . fixing a specific @xmath0-tree model , it is the nir graph treewidth of an rna that determines the performance on the rna .",
    "second , the nir graph treewidth is also related to scalability of our method .",
    "the current algorithm for the nucleotide prediction problem has the complexity @xmath7 for both time and memory requirements . with a large hidden constant in the polynomial",
    ", the implemented program bktree typically runs in 2 to 3 hours on an rna of length 100 and uses several gigabytes of memory .",
    "this is because the current prototype has aimed at accuracy without optimization in computational efficiency .",
    "however , the problem ( based on the @xmath0-tree model ) has an inherent complexity of @xmath8 ; our method is scalable to suit longer and more complex rnas , e.g. , which require the @xmath6-tree model .",
    "third , due to the lack of tools to model 3d conformations from nucleotide interactions of all types , it is an immediate future task of ours is to develop such a tool that can be pipelined with a program like bktree for _ ab initio _",
    "3d structure prediction .",
    "we perceive such a task to be feasible .",
    "this is because the output of program bktree contains not only the predicted nucleotide interactions but also a backbone @xmath9-tree that decomposes nucleotides according to their interconnectivity .",
    "the given 3-tree can be the basis for very efficient algorithms for computing a desirable optimization function on 3d conformations @xcite .",
