    "the random domino automaton , proposed in @xcite , is a stochastic cellular automaton with avalanches .",
    "it was introduced as a toy model of earthquakes , but can be also regarded as an substantial extension of 1-d forest - fire model proposed by drossel and schwabl @xcite .    the remarkable feature of the rda is the explicit one - to - one relation between details of the dynamical rules of the automaton ( represented by rebound parameters @xmath1 defined in cited article and also below ) and the produced stationary distribution @xmath2 of clusters of size @xmath3 , which implies distribution of avalanches . it is already shown how to reconstruct details of the `` microscopic '' dynamics from the observed `` macroscopic '' behaviour of the system @xcite .    as a field of application of rda we studied a possibility of constructing the ito equation from a given time series and - in a broader sense - applicability of ito equation as a model of natural phenomena .",
    "for rda - which plays a role of a fully controlled stochastic natural phenomenon - the relevant ito equation can be constructed in two ways : derived directly from equations and by histogram method from generated time series .",
    "then these two results are compared and investigated in @xcite .",
    "note that the set of equations of the rda in a special limit case reduces to the recurrence , which leads to known integer sequence - the motzkin numbers , which establishes a new , remarkable link between the combinatorial object and the stochastic cellular automaton @xcite .    in the present paper a finite version of random domino automaton is investigated .",
    "the mathematical formulation in finite case is precise and the presented results clarify which formulas are exact and allow to estimate approximations we impose in infinite case presented in @xcite .",
    "we also show , that equations of finite rda can reproduce results of @xcite , when size @xmath4 of the system is increasing and distributions satisfy an additional assumption ( @xmath5 for big @xmath3 ) .    on the other hand , a time evolution of finite rda can exhibit a periodic - like behaviour ( the assumption @xmath5 for big @xmath3 is violated ) , which is a novel property .",
    "thus , based on the same microscopic rules , depending on a choice of parameters of the model , a wide range of properties is possible to obtain . in particular ,",
    "such behaviour is interesting in the context of recurrence parameters of earthquakes ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for other simple periodic - like models ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the finite case makes an opportunity to employ markov chains techniques to analyse rda .",
    "investigating the automaton in markov chains framework we arrive at several novel conclusions , in particular related to expected waiting times for some specified behaviour .",
    "this article completes and substantially extends previous studies of rda on the level of mathematical structure .",
    "we analyse properties of the automaton related to time evolution and others , as a preparation for further prospective comparisons with natural phenomena , including earthquakes .",
    "a matter of adjusting the model to the real data is left for the forthcoming paper .",
    "the plan of the article is as follows . mimicking @xcite in section [ sec : def ] we define the finite rda . in section [ sec : equations ] we derive respective equations for finite rda . in section [ sec : cases ] we will specify them for some chosen cases . in section [ sec : markov ] we will shortly describe markov chains setting and describe time aspects of frda .",
    "several examples are presented in section [ sec : examples ] .",
    "the last section [ sec : conclusions ] contain conclusions and remarks . in the appendix",
    "we show non existence of exact equations for rda as well as present supplementary formulas and table [ tab : statesn10 ] displaying all states of rda of size @xmath6 .",
    "the rules for finite random domino automaton are the same as in @xcite . we assume : + - space is 1-dimensional and discrete  consists of @xmath4 cells ; + - periodic boundary conditions ( the last cell is adjacent to the first one ) ; + - cell may be in one of two states : empty or occupied by a single ball ; + - time is discrete and in each time step an incoming ball hits one arbitrarily chosen cell ( each cell is equally probable ) .",
    "the state of the automaton changes according to the following rule : + @xmath7 if the chosen cell is empty it becomes occupied with probability @xmath8 ; with probability @xmath9 the incoming ball is rebounded and the state remains unchanged ; + @xmath7 if the chosen cell is occupied , the incoming ball provokes an avalanche with probability @xmath10 ( it removes balls from hit cell and from all adjacent cells ) ; with probability @xmath11 the incoming ball is rebounded and the state remains unchanged .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 is assumed to be a constant but the parameter @xmath10 is allowed to be a function of size of the hit cluster .",
    "the way in which the probability of removing a cluster depends on its size strongly influences evolution of the system and leads to various interesting properties , as presented in the following sections .",
    "we note in advance that in fact there is only one effective parameter @xmath12 which affects properties of the automaton .",
    "changing of @xmath10 and @xmath8 proportionally in a sense corresponds to a rescaling of time unit .",
    "a diagram shown below presents an automaton of size @xmath13 , with three clusters ( of size @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) in time @xmath16 .",
    "an incoming ball provokes an relaxation of the size * two * , thus in time @xmath17 there are two clusters ( of size @xmath18 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "l c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c & & + time @xmath19 & @xmath20 & @xmath21 & @xmath21 & @xmath22 & @xmath22 & @xmath21 & @xmath22 & @xmath7 & @xmath23 & @xmath22 & @xmath22 & @xmath21 & @xmath21 & @xmath24 +   + time @xmath25 & @xmath26 & @xmath7 & @xmath7 & @xmath27 & @xmath22 & @xmath21 & @xmath22 & @xmath28 & @xmath29 & @xmath22 & @xmath22 & @xmath7 & @xmath21 & @xmath30 + & & & +   +    denote by @xmath31 the number of clusters of length @xmath3 , and by @xmath32 the number of empty clusters of length @xmath3 . due to periodic boundary conditions , the number of clusters is equal to the number of empty clusters in the lattice if two cases are excluded - when the lattice is full ( single cluster of size @xmath4 ) and when the lattice is empty ( single empty cluster of size @xmath4 ) .",
    "hence for @xmath33 we have @xmath34 the density @xmath35 of the system is defined as @xmath36 in this article we investigate a stationary state of the automaton and hence the variables @xmath37 and others are expected values and do not depend of time .",
    "in this section we derive equations describing stationary state of finite rda .",
    "the general idea of the reasoning presented below is : the gain and loss terms balance one another .",
    "the density @xmath35 may increase only if an empty cell becomes occupied , and the gain per one time step is @xmath38 .",
    "it happens with probability @xmath39 .",
    "density losses are realized by avalanches and may be of various size .",
    "the effective loss is a product of the size @xmath3 of the avalanche and probability of its appearance @xmath40 .",
    "any size @xmath3 contribute , hence the balance of @xmath35 reads @xmath41 we emphasise , the above result is exact  no correlations were neglected .",
    "its form is directly analogous to the respective formula in @xcite .",
    "* gain . * a new cluster",
    "( can be of size @xmath18 only ) can be created in the interior of empty cluster of size @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 if the empty cluster is of size @xmath4 , then each cell is in interior .",
    "summing up contributions for all empty clusters , the probability is @xmath44 which can take a form ( for @xmath45 ) @xmath46    * loss . * two ways",
    "contribute : joining a cluster with another one and removing a cluster due to avalanche .",
    "joining of two clusters can occur if there exists an empty cluster of length @xmath18 between them .",
    "the exception is when the empty @xmath18-cluster is the only one empty cluster , and the system consists of a single cluster of length @xmath47 .",
    "hence , the probability of joining two clusters is @xmath48 the probability of avalanche is just @xmath49    gathering these terms one obtains equation for balance of the total number of clusters @xmath50 @xmath51 again we emphasise that the above result is exact  no correlations were neglected .",
    "finite size of the system reflects in the appearance of @xmath52 instead of @xmath53 in the respective formula in @xcite .",
    "* there are two modes .",
    "+ ( a ) enlarging - an empty cluster on the edge of an @xmath3-cluster becomes occupied .",
    "there are two such empty clusters except for the case when system contains a single cluster of length @xmath47 .",
    "hence , the respective rates are @xmath54 ( b ) relaxation rate for any @xmath55 is given by @xmath56    * gain .",
    "* again , there are two modes . + ( a ) enlarging . for @xmath45 ,",
    "there are following rates depending on the size @xmath3 of the cluster @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a probability that the size of empty cluster adjacent to the @xmath3-cluster is bigger than @xmath18 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath59 formula does not have a factor @xmath60 , because there is only one empty cluster ( of size @xmath18 ) .",
    "\\(b ) merger of two clusters up to the cluster of size @xmath3 .",
    "two clusters : one of size @xmath61 and the other of size @xmath62 will be combined if the ball fills an empty cell between them . @xmath63",
    "the probability is proportional to the number of empty @xmath18-clusters between @xmath64-cluster and @xmath65-cluster , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a probability of such merger .",
    "for @xmath68 there is a single cluster in the lattice ( there are no two clusters to merge ) - filling the gap between ends of @xmath69-cluster is already considered in ( a ) .    gathering the terms , one obtains @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "the last equation has simple explanation .",
    "the state with all cells being occupied ( corresponding to @xmath72 ) can be achieved only from the state with a single empty cell ( corresponding to @xmath73 ) with probability @xmath74 . on the other hand ,",
    "the automaton leaves the state with all cells being occupied with probability @xmath75 .",
    "note that equations and are exact .",
    "correlations in the systems reflect in appearing of multipliers @xmath76 and @xmath67 .",
    "their values depends on possible configurations of states of the automaton . as shown in the appendix , for @xmath77 exact formulas for @xmath76 and @xmath67 as functions of @xmath2s do not exist .",
    "hence , it is necessary to propose approximated formulas .",
    "a mean field type approximation for @xmath76 is @xmath78 for a given cluster of size @xmath3 , the probability of appearance of an empty cluster of size @xmath18 is calculated as proportional to the number of empty @xmath18-clusters divided by the sum of the numbers of all empty clusters with size not exceeding @xmath47 , because there is no room for larger .",
    "when merger of two clusters up to a cluster of size @xmath3 is considered , the room denoted by @xmath79 is of size @xmath80 and the room denoted by @xmath81 is of size @xmath82 - see a diagram below .",
    "@xmath83 hence a mean field type approximation for @xmath67 is of the form @xmath84 it is also instructive to consider another approximation @xmath85 section [ sec : examples ] contains quantitative estimation of proposed approximations . comparison of this approximation with exact results for small sizes @xmath4 is discussed in section [ sec : conclusions ] .      in the paper",
    "@xcite an assumption of independence of clusters was considered . to have it adequate",
    ", it is required that there are no limitations in space , like those encountered when formulas and were considered . for systems that are big enough , i.e. , when @xmath86 , an empty cluster adjacent to a given @xmath3-cluster can be of any size , and thus @xmath87 this is consistent with the requirement that @xmath88 when @xmath89 , which is required to have moments of the @xmath2s convergent .",
    "similarly , @xmath90 these formulas substituted into - give the respective set of equations considered in @xcite .",
    "the same reasoning can be applied to balance equations .",
    "the form of equation is left unchanged under the limit . for equation , @xmath91 , and it becomes of the form presented in @xcite .",
    "for fixed form of rebound parameters equations describing the automaton can be written in more specific form .",
    "this is the case for balance equations and , as well as for formulas for average cluster size @xmath92 and average avalanche size @xmath93 we emphasize , these formulas are exact  correlations are encountered .",
    "we consider three special cases investigated in detail and illustrated by examples below",
    ".      for @xmath94 and @xmath95 equation is of the form @xmath96 and equation @xmath97 also formulas for @xmath98 and @xmath99 are simplified only a little .",
    "equation is of the form @xmath102 hence the density is given by remarkably neat ( end exact ) formula @xmath103 note that there is no dependence on the size of the system @xmath4 ; for @xmath86 it remains the same .",
    "equation can be written as @xmath104 where we use equations and .",
    "hence the formula for @xmath105 is of the form @xmath106 in direct analogy with @xmath50 in @xmath86 case @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath105 plays the role of @xmath50 , as indicated also in balance of @xmath107 equation .",
    "the formula for @xmath50 is @xmath108    the average cluster size is given by @xmath109 the average avalanche size is equal to the average cluster size @xmath110 because each cluster has the same probability to be removed from the lattice .",
    "the above formulas are exact ( include correlations ) and have good thermodynamic limit ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "note also that variables @xmath35 and @xmath105 depend on single parameter @xmath112 .",
    "formulas with dependence on @xmath112 can be rewritten as functions of density @xmath35 .",
    "equation is of the form @xmath115    equation can be written as @xmath116 where equation is used , namely @xmath117 .    the average cluster size @xmath118 and the average avalanche size @xmath119 where @xmath120 note that also these formulas are exact .",
