    "carbon nanotube and graphene - based nanomechanical resonators ( gnmr ) have attracted significant attention from the scientific community ; see the recent reviews of refs .  .",
    "experiments have demonstrated that single - walled carbon nanotube nanomechanical resonators can serve as a mass sensor that is capable of detecting individual atoms or molecules  @xcite , which is made possible by the high stiffness and low mass of carbon nanotubes .",
    "graphene also possesses high stiffness  @xcite , but may prove to be a superior mass sensor than nanotubes due to its significantly larger surface area on which molecules can attach .",
    "the performance of gnmr mass sensors is closely related to its quality ( q)-factor , which reflects the energy that is lost during the mechanical oscillation of the resonator . in the first reported study of gnmrs , bunch _",
    "et al . _ observed very low ( @xmath0 ) q - factors for gnmrs working in the megahertz range  @xcite . in a later experiment ,",
    "the same group reported a dramatic increase of the q - factor at lower temperatures , with the q - factors reaching up to 9000 at 10k for gnmrs produced from the chemical vapor deposition growth method  @xcite .",
    "et al . _ also found that the q - factor of gnmr increases with decreasing temperature , and reaches @xmath1 at 5 k  @xcite .",
    "more recently , eichler _ et al . _",
    "@xcite found that the q - factors of gnmrs can reach values of @xmath2 , which is very close to the theoretical q - factor upper bound of about @xmath3 , which has been predicted for gnmrs with all edges fixed coupled with idealized mechanical actuation  @xcite .    because a key sensing objective for gnmrs is to enable detection of individual molecules or atoms , it is critical to determine methods of enhancing their mass sensitivity .",
    "for example , eichler _ et al . _ have shown that it is possible to increase the resonant frequency ( and thus the mass sensitivity ) of gnmrs by driving its mechanical oscillation into the nonlinear regime , which was explained using a continuum mechanics model  @xcite . using similar continuum models ,",
    "several groups have theoretically studied the nonlinear effect on the mass sensitivity of different nanoresonators  @xcite , with only a single , recent study related to graphene  @xcite . besides the nonlinear resonance ,",
    "mechanical strain is another possible method to improve the mass sensitivity of the gnmr , as the resonant frequency can be enhanced by mechanical tension  @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we investigate the utility of inducing nonlinear oscillations to enhance the mass sensitivity of gbmrs using classical molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation .",
    "our simulations show that the adsorption - induced frequency shift resulting from a single au atom can be enhanced by increasing the actuation energy , when the actuation energy parameter @xmath4 is below a critical value @xmath5 . for actuation energy above the critical value , the adsorbed au atom exhibits significant diffusion , which reduces the q - factor of the gnmr by more than three orders of magnitude and",
    "significantly degrades the mass sensitivity . quite different from the widely used continuum mechanics explanation ,",
    "we show that the nonlinear - induced frequency enhancement results from the ` effective strain ' that is induced in the oscillating gnmr .",
    "we derive an analytic expression for the effective strain @xmath6 ( here @xmath7 is the kinetic energy , @xmath8 the mass , @xmath9 the angular frequency , and @xmath10 length of the resonator ) that enables us to directly link the equivalence of applied mechanical tensile strain and the strain induced by nonlinear oscillations to the resonant frequencies of the gnmrs .",
    "the graphene sample in our simulations has dimensions @xmath11   , and is composed of 504 carbon atoms .",
    "the atoms at the @xmath12 and @xmath13 ends of the gnmr are fixed , while periodic boundary conditions are applied in the @xmath14 direction .",
    "the interactions of the carbon atoms are described by the brenner ( rebo - ii ) potential  @xcite . for the cases where a single au atom is adsorbed on the gnmr",
    ", the interaction between the au atom and the gnmr is modeled by a lennard - jones potential with length parameter @xmath15=2.9943   and energy parameter @xmath16=0.02936  ev  @xcite .",
    "the standard newton equations of motion are integrated in time using the velocity verlet algorithm with a time step of 1 fs .",
    "our simulations are performed as follows .",
    "first , the nos - hoover@xcite thermostat is applied to thermalize the system to a constant temperature of 4.2  k within the nvt ensemble , which is run for @xmath2 md steps .",
    "the mechanical oscillation of the resonator is then actuated by adding a velocity distribution to the system , which follows the morphology of the first flexural vibrational mode of graphene  @xcite .",
    "the imposed velocity distribution , or actuation energy , is @xmath17 , where @xmath7 is the total kinetic energy in the gnmr after thermalization but just before its actuation and @xmath4 is the actuation energy parameter .",
    "after the actuation energy is applied , the system is allowed to oscillate freely within the nve ensemble for @xmath18 md steps .",
    "the data from the nve ensemble is used to analyze the mechanical oscillation of the gnmr .",
    "during the free vibration period , the energy in the gnmr switches between kinetic and potential energy .",
    "the frequency of the switching is @xmath19 , with @xmath20 being the frequency of mechanical oscillation .",
    "[ fig_fft_alpha ] shows the resonant peaks that are obtained by taking a fourier transformation of the time history of the kinetic energy ; the resonant peaks are used to extract the resonant frequency @xmath20 at liquid helium temperature ( 4.2 k ) for gnmrs with different actuation energies @xmath21 0.1 , 0.5 , 1.0 , 1.5 , and 2.0 , where for reference , @xmath22 means that the actuation energy equals the total kinetic energy in the gnmr after thermalization .",
    "it should be noted that the amplitude in fig .",
    "[ fig_fft_alpha ] is large , because of the long simulation time we have performed .",
    "we focus on the liquid helium temperature because this temperature is commonly utilized in experiments involving gnmrs ( eg .",

    "[ fig_f_au_pure ] shows the resonant frequency as a function of actuation energy @xmath4 .",
    "panel ( a ) shows that the resonant frequency is enhanced by increasing @xmath4 .",
    "this enhancement is due to the increasingly nonlinear behavior of the gnmr induced by the increasing oscillation amplitude .",
    "adsorption of a single au atom on top of the gnmr causes a considerable reduction of the resonant frequency , due to the resulting increase in effective mass of the gnmr .",
    "this frequency shift is what is measured experimentally to detect the adsorbed mass , and it is seen in panel ( b ) that the magnitude of the frequency shift increases by a factor of three for large actuation energies ( @xmath23 ) as compared to if the gnmr was actuated with a small @xmath4 .",
    "panel ( b ) shows that the frequency shift can be increased by applying larger actuation energies , which also results in increased mass sensitivity .",
    "however , as shown in the same figure , the frequency shift does not increase monotonically , and a decrease with increasing actuation energy is observed when @xmath4 is large .",
    "the reduction in the frequency shift with increasing @xmath4 is determined to be a result of diffusion of the adsorbed au atom , which was previously observed to occur at gnmr temperatures exceeding about 30  k  @xcite . to confirm the diffusion mechanism ,",
    "we calculate in fig .",
    "[ fig_meanfreepath ] the mean free path for the au atom as a function of @xmath4 , where a sharp jump in the mean free path is observed at a critical value of actuation energy @xmath24 . for @xmath25 ,",
    "the mean free path of the au atom is around 0.5   / ps with small fluctuations .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath26 , the mean free path increases to a value around 1.0   / ps , which implies diffusion of the au atom .",

    "[ fig_meanfreepath ] shows resonant curves for smaller actuation energy @xmath21 0.1 and 1.5 .",

    "[ fig_trajectory ] illustrates the trajectory history of the au atom with @xmath21 1.0 , 2.075 , 2.1 , and 4.0 .",
    "the diffusion is clearly observed for actuation energy above the critical value @xmath27 .",
    "the thermal noise provides important energy damping channels for the mechanical oscillation of the gnmr . as a result , the q - factor of the gnmr",
    "is greatly reduced as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_quality_factor_alpha ] .",
    "there is almost no energy dissipation in gnmr for actuation energy below @xmath27 , leading to extremely high q - factors .",
    "for actuation energy above the critical value , the q - factor is reduced by more than three orders of magnitude .",

    "[ fig_quality_factor_absorbate ] shows the q - factor vs. the actuation energy parameter @xmath4 for graphene nanomechanical resonators with three different adsorbates . in these three systems ,",
    "the adsorbate mass @xmath8 and the lennard - jones interaction parameter @xmath16 are ( @xmath8 , @xmath16 ) , ( @xmath30 , @xmath16 ) , and ( @xmath8 , @xmath31 ) . for the first system ( @xmath8 , @xmath16 ) , the mass of the adsorbate is @xmath32 and the lennard - jones potential parameter is @xmath33  ev , which are the actual values for au adsorbate .",
    "for the second system ( @xmath30 , @xmath16 ) , the mass of the adsorbate is reduced by half to be @xmath34 while @xmath16 ( the interaction strength between the adsorbate and graphene ) remains unchanged . in the third system ( @xmath8 , @xmath31 ) , the mass of the adsorbate is unchanged at @xmath32 while the interaction strength @xmath16 between the adsorbate and graphene is reduced by half .    in all three systems , there is a sharp decrease in the q - factor at different values of actuation energy parameter @xmath4 , which results from the diffusion of the adsorbate .",
    "these results also follow physical intuition .",
    "for example , diffusion happens at smaller @xmath4 for adsorbates that have a weaker bonding strength with graphene .",
    "in contrast , diffusion happens at larger @xmath4 for adsorbates with less mass , since those atoms have a smaller kinetic energy at the same temperature as larger mass adsorbates , and therefore more energy via the nonlinear actuation parameter @xmath4 is needed to induce diffusion for the smaller mass atoms .",
    "these results may serve as useful guidelines for experimentalists to verify our theoretical predictions , as different types of adsorbates ( of different mass or / and different interaction strengths with graphene ) are usually observed experimentally .",
    "the above discussion has established that the mass sensitivity of the gnmr can be enhanced by driving the mechanical oscillations into the nonlinear regime using a larger actuation energy .",
    "the remainder of this article will be devoted to explaining the mechanism that enables the nonlinear - induced resonant frequency , and thus mass sensitivity enhancement .    as illustrated in fig .",

    "the agreement is particularly good for @xmath51 , though there is an increasing discrepancy for larger @xmath4 .",
    "the solid lines ( red online ) show that this discrepancy is greatly improved by considering a high - order correction in the square of the oscillation amplitude @xmath52 .",

    "@xmath54 deviates from linear behavior because of the phonon - phonon scattering .",
    "although the temperature is quite low ( 4.2  k ) , the phonon - phonon scattering is still important for the first bending mode ( i.e the mode of mechanical oscillation ) because this mode is in a highly non - equilibrium state . in other words , because the first bending mode has been mechanically actuated with very large amplitude , it is driven far away from its thermal equilibrium state at 4.2  k. our md simulations gives @xmath55 for the pure gnmr .",

    "i.e @xmath65 , we can obtain the oscillation amplitude of an arbitrary system length as @xmath66 , where @xmath67   and @xmath68   for our simulated system at @xmath64 .",
    "for instance , the mechanical oscillation amplitude becomes 67  nm if the system length is 100  nm . if the system length is 1  @xmath69 m , then the mechanical oscillation amplitude is very large , i.e. 6.7  @xmath69 m . these results show that @xmath22 is large enough to induce oscillations that can be clearly distinguished from random thermal fluctuations in experiments .",
    "previously , we have established that the effective strain mechanism can explain the enhancement of the resonant frequency that occurs by increasing @xmath4 .",
    "however , we also needed to perform a high - order correction for large actuation energies to account for the phonon - phonon scattering that is still present even at the low ( 4.2  k ) temperature due to the highly non - equilibrium behavior resulting from the large actuation energy .",
    "however , if the temperature is reduced to 0  k , there is no phonon - phonon scattering for the first bending mode because this mode can not decay without the assistance of other vibrations according to symmetry selection rules  @xcite . as a result , at 0  k , the enhancement of the resonant frequency by applying tensile strain before actuation should agree with that obtained by increasing the actuation energy , without any high - order correction .",

    "the pre - stretched gnmr is actuated with a very small actuation energy @xmath50 so that the effect from @xmath4 can be ignored and only strain is important in this case .",
    "we observe exactly the same resonant frequency in the mechanical oscillation in these two very different situations . from the fourier transformation of the time history of thees two kinetic energy",
