    "the spectroscopy of @xmath1  pairs offers a new approach to the study of baryon resonances excited in nucleon - nucleon reactions .",
    "dilepton ( that is e@xmath3e@xmath4 or @xmath5@xmath6 ) observables provide indeed information on the electromagnetic structure of the resonances and , in the context of vector meson dominance , their coupling to the light vector mesons @xcite .",
    "furthermore , dilepton spectroscopy allows to study the properties of hadrons produced and decayed in a strongly interacting medium .",
    "this is because leptons do not themselves interact strongly when propagating through hadronic matter , that is , their kinematics remains basically undistorted .",
    "for that reason they are used to probe medium modifications of hadrons intensively searched for in photon and proton - induced reactions on nuclei as well as in heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "transport models are commonly employed to describe particle production and propagation through the medium , in particular when dealing with the complex dynamics of nucleus - nucleus reactions @xcite .",
    "the proper modeling of lepton pair production mechanisms requires a solid understanding of the underlying elementary processes , be it in terms of resonance excitations or in terms of a string fragmentation picture @xcite .",
    "the hades experiment pursues a comprehensive program of dielectron emission studies in @xmath7 @xcite , in @xmath8 @xcite , as well as in @xmath9 collisions @xcite .",
    "inclusive @xmath1  production in @xmath0 and @xmath10 reactions had formerly been studied in the range of 1 - 5 gev  by the dls experiment at the bevalac @xcite , and more recently by hades at 1.25  gev  @xcite and 3.5  gev  @xcite . in particular , the comparison of the latter data sets with various model calculations demonstrated a need for improved theoretical descriptions . in this paper",
    "we supplement the available body of experimental results with data obtained on inclusive @xmath1  production in the @xmath11 reaction at 2.2  gev .",
    "a direct comparison with dls data measured at 2.09  gev  @xcite is presented .",
    "furthermore , through the comparison with a calculated @xmath1  cocktail , we extract the inclusive production cross sections of @xmath12 and @xmath13 mesons at 2.2 gev .",

    "technical aspects of the detector are described in  @xcite .",
    "its main component serving for electron and positron selection is a hadron - blind ring - imaging cherenkov detector ( rich ) .",
    "further particle identification power is provided by the time of flight measured in a plastic scintillator wall ( tof ) , the electromagnetic shower characteristics observed in a pre - shower detector , and the energy - loss signals from the scintillators of the tof wall .    in the experiment discussed here",

    "an intensity of about @xmath16 particles per second impinged on a 5  cm long liquid hydrogen cell with a total areal thickness of 0.35  g/@xmath17 .",
    "the online event selection was done in two steps : ( 1 ) a 1@xmath18-level trigger ( lvl1 ) selected events with an overall multiplicity of at least four charged hits in the tof wall with additional topological conditions ( two opposite sectors hit , two hits at polar angles @xmath19 ) , and ( 2 ) a 2@xmath20-level trigger ( lvl2 ) required an electron or positron candidate .",
    "this trigger scheme was in fact optimized for measuring exclusive @xmath1  production in the @xmath21 reaction with a subsequent @xmath13 dalitz decay @xcite .",
    "note that such a trigger condition still allows to study , albeit with a bias , inclusive @xmath1  emission .",
    "indeed , because of overall charge conservation in the @xmath0  reaction , the dielectron is always accompanied by at least two more charged particles .",
    "the resulting trigger bias has been studied in simulations as a function of various pair observables , in particular pair mass and pair transverse momentum , providing a correction as well as an estimate of the resulting systematic error ( of order 20% ) . for normalization purposes , @xmath0",
    "elastic scattering events were recorded concurrently with an additional scaled - down ( by a factor 32 ) lvl1 trigger condition requiring only two charged hits in opposite hades sectors .",
    "thus , in total @xmath22 lvl1 events were recorded , @xmath23 of which fulfilled the lvl2 condition .",
    "dielectrons ( that is e@xmath3e@xmath4 pairs ) were reconstructed following the procedures described in detail in @xcite : ( 1 ) leptons were identified based on various detector observables , ( 2 ) an efficiency correction was applied , ( 3 ) opposite - sign leptons were combined into pairs , ( 4 ) the background of uncorrelated ( and partially correlated ) pairs representing the combinatorial background ( cb ) was subtracted using the same - event geometric mean of like - sign pairs , ( 5 ) the correction for the lvl1 trigger bias was applied , and finally ( 6 ) the resulting inclusive @xmath1  distributions were normalized to the reconstructed yield of elastically scattered protons into the hades geometric acceptance ( see @xcite for details ) . as no dedicated start detector was present in this experimental run , the start time for the time - of - flight measurement was reconstructed event - by - event from the most optimal fit of different event hypotheses to the global event data @xcite .",

    "the data are presented with analysis cuts on single - lepton momentum , @xmath25 gev/@xmath26 , and on pair opening angle , @xmath27 .",
    "the total number of @xmath1  signal pairs contributing to this spectrum is around 19,000 from which 2,000 pairs are located above the @xmath12 dalitz region ( @xmath28 gev/@xmath2 ) . to illustrate the significance of the reconstructed dielectron signal",

    "[ pp_systematics ] with inclusive data from other hades @xmath0  runs done at 1.25 @xcite and 3.5 gev  @xcite bombarding energy , respectively .",
    "while the 3.5  gevdata were recorded in the same detector acceptance as the present 2.2  gev  data , the 1.25  gev  data were adjusted for differences in the magnetic field strengths and analysis cuts used . this way the three data sets",
    "are compared within the same instrumental acceptance , revealing the strong beam energy dependence of dielectron production , particularly at large pair masses .",
    "note , however , that between the three beam energies the average momentum of the involved single lepton distributions differs significantly , resulting in substantially different fractions of accepted pairs , particularly for low masses .      as the former dls experiment provided @xmath1  data for the @xmath0  reaction at 2.09  gev  @xcite , we can make a direct comparison along the line already used to confront the dls and hades c+c data obtained at 1@xmath29  gev  @xcite .",
    "as the hades geometrical acceptance is substantially broader than the dls one such a comparison can be done by projecting the reconstructed hades dielectron yields @xmath30 through the dls acceptance filter @xcite ( here @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the @xmath1  pair transverse momentum and rapidity , respectively ) .",
    "in fact , as dls applied to their @xmath0  data additional cleaning cuts @xcite  @xmath33 gev/@xmath2 , @xmath34 gev/@xmath26 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36  an extrapolation of the hades yield to rapidities above 1.9 , as applied in @xcite , is not needed here .",

    "[ hades_dls](a ) for the pair mass distributions @xmath24 and in ( b ) for the pair transverse momentum spectrum @xmath37 , the latter one with the condition @xmath38 gev/@xmath2 .",
    "[ hades_dls ]    it is apparent that , within statistical and systematic uncertainties , the hades and the dls data are in good agreement .",
    "this result suggests that our result , together with the data obtained by the dls energy scan @xcite , can be used to constrain the various models aimed at describing dielectron production in few - gev  elementary reactions @xcite .",
    "the experimental pair distributions are next compared to a calculated @xmath1  cocktail . for this",
    ", @xmath0  reactions were simulated with the event generator pluto @xcite and filtered through the hades acceptance .",

    "at the present bombarding energy the production of @xmath12 and @xmath13 mesons is known to proceed mostly via resonance excitation ( e.g. @xmath46 = @xmath47 , etc . ) and is dominated by one - meson and two - meson channels @xcite . for @xmath48 and @xmath49",
    "production we have , however , assumed phase - space population in the @xmath50 reactions ( @xmath51 or @xmath49 ) with no further attempt at a more refined description of the high - mass region .",
    "note that some of the excited resonances @xmath46 , mostly the @xmath52 , contribute also directly to the dielectron yield via their electromagnetic dalitz decay @xmath53 . in our cocktail calculation",
    "we have only taken into account the @xmath54 and @xmath55 contributions following the prescription from ref .",
    "the production cross sections used in the simulation were taken as follows :    1 .",
    "inclusive @xmath12 production  14  mb ( adding all observed inelastic channels contributing to @xmath12 production from ref .",
    "@xcite gives a lower limit of about 12  mb , whereas 14  mb are needed to fully exhaust the measured dalitz yield ) .",

    "0.01  mb exclusive @xmath49 production @xcite and assuming likewise for the @xmath48 , but no @xmath56 contribution .",
    "inclusive @xmath57 excitation  in the range 10 - 21  mb .",
    "the extremes of the cross section range used for @xmath52 production correspond to the following two scenarios : ( i ) assumes that pion production is mediated completely by single @xmath52 excitation only , that is @xmath58 ( from isospin addition rules ) , resulting in the upper value of 21  mb ; scenario ( ii ) sums explicitly the @xmath52 contributions from one - pion and two - pion production channels . in the latter the one - pion part of 3.6  mb",
    "is taken from a resonance model fit to exclusive pion production data @xcite whereas the two - pion part of 6.4  mb is taken from the effective lagrangian model of two - pion production presented in ref .  @xcite . under the assumption and as suggested indeed by various calculations @xcite that dielectron production is dominated in the mass range 0.15 - 0.45  gev/@xmath2by the @xmath52 and @xmath13 contributions , the total yield measured for these masses can be used to constrain the @xmath13 contribution for any assumed @xmath52 cross section . in other words ,",
    "the @xmath13 and @xmath52 contributions are complementary .",
    "the extracted @xmath13 cross section will evidently have a model dependence which , however , turns out to be small .",

    "integrating up to 0.15  gev/@xmath2  the low - mass region , dominated evidently by the @xmath12 dalitz contribution , and correcting for the detector acceptance , allows to fix the inclusive @xmath12 production cross section at @xmath61  mb .",
    "the quoted 25% error is determined mostly by systematic effects ( normalization , trigger bias correction , acceptance correction ) . in a similar way",
    ", the integrated yield from the mass region of 0.15 - 0.45  gev/@xmath2has been used to extract the cross section of inclusive @xmath13 production after correcting , as stated above , for the @xmath52 contribution .",
