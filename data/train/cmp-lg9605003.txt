    "during the last years , several different analyses for partial verb phrase fronting have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the most promising account so far has been the one of hinrichs and nakazawa .",
    "this account , however , suffers from some drawbacks that will be discussed in section [ alternatives ] .",
    "i will present a rather simple account that uses the standard nonloc mechanism hpsg @xcite provides . in section [ licensing",
    "] , i will discuss a problem that arises for all accounts of partial verb phrase fronting : underspecified comps lists . by the means of a new daughter ( licensing daughter ) in a schema for the introduction of nonlocal dependencies",
    "this problem will be solved .",
    "in german , it is possible to front non - maximal verbal projections . in a series of papers , hinrichs and",
    "nakazawa argued for a special rule schema that combines the verbs of a so - called _ verbal complex _ before the arguments of the involved verbs are combined with the verbal complex .",
    "because the verbal complex is build before any nonverbal argument of a verb gets saturated , it is possible to account for phenomena like _ auxiliary flip_. as the verbal complex is analyzed as a constituent , the fronting of _ erzhlen mssen _ in ( b ) can be explained as well .",
    "there is no problem with sentences like those in ( ) for the standard nonloc mechanism .",
    "_ erzhlen mssen _ is a constituent in the non - fronted position in ( ) and the same holds if the verbal complex is fronted .",
    "there are , however , examples where a partly saturated verbal complex is fronted .",
    "a verb with some of its arguments may appear in the _ vorfeld _ leaving other arguments in the _",
    "mittelfeld_.    as ( ) shows , it is possible that a pp in the _ mittelfeld _ modifies a fronted verbal complex .",
    "sentences like ( a ) are ungrammatical .",
    "it is not possible to front parts of the verbal complex that would be located in the middle of the verbal complex in a verb final sentence ( b ) .",
    "in what follows , i assume a version of hpsg that deviates from standard hpsg in that the surface string of a phrasal sign is not determined by a relation that relates the phon values of a sign to the phon values of its daughters @xcite . instead i will follow reape s approach .",
    "reape assumes word order domains as an additional level of representation .",
    "in such a domain , all daughters of a head occur .",
    "these domains differ from the daughter list in that the elements in a domain ( signs ) correspond in their serialization to the surface order of the words in the string .",
    "lp - constraints apply to elements of the order domain .",
    "another basic assumption of reape is that constituents may be discontinuous .    as hinrichs and nakazawa ( 1994a ) have shown , it is reasonable to assume in addition to the head complement schema a schema that licenses the verbal complex .",
    "hinrichs and nakazawa introduced the concept of argument attraction into the hpsg framework .",
    "if a verbal complex is build two verbs are combined and the resulting sign inherits all arguments from both verbs . in their paper , hinrichs and nakazawa treat verbal complements as ordinary complements that are included in the comps list of their heads .",
    "it has however proven to be useful to distinguish the verbal complement from other complements @xcite .",
    "the merits of this move will be discussed shortly . for the purpose of representing the information about verbal complements , the feature vcomp is introduced .",
    "its value is a _",
    "synsem_-object if the verb embeds another verb and _ none _ otherwise .",
    "the entry in the stem lexicon for the future tense auxiliary _ werden _ ( _ will _ ) is shown in ( ) .",

    "the resulting sign is a verbal complex or a part of a verbal complex .",
    "it is marked lex+ because it can in turn be embedded .",
    "the lex feature in the entry for _ werden _ ensures that a matrix verb is combined with its verbal complement before the verbal complement is saturated by one of its complements .",
    "it is therefore possible to avoid multiple structures in the _ mittelfeld_. but exactly those constituents that have to be avoided in the _ mittelfeld _ are needed in the _",
    "vorfeld_. very complicate mechanisms have been introduced to cope with this problem without a lot of spurious ambiguities @xcite .",
    "i will suggest a solution to the problem that is very simple : if it is the case that an embedded verb or verbal complex has to be lex+ when verb and complement are combined locally and if it is the case that this does not hold if a nonlocal dependency is involved than the simplest solution is to view lex not as a local feature . if one assumes that lex lives under the path synsem instead of synsem@xmath3loc than the problem turns into a non - issue",
    ".    figures [ abb - seiner - tochter - erzaehlen ] and [ abb - vortragen - wird ] show the analyses of the sentences in ( ) . in the analyses of ( a ) , a trace functions as a verbal complement . in ( b )",
    "a trace for a verb is modified by an adverb .",
    "= 0.9    = 0.9    sentences like ( [ ex - muessen]a ) are ruled out because _ wird _ selects a complement in _ bse_-form that has a vcomp value _ none_. as _ erzhlen _ does not appear in any comps list it is not possible for the verb to count as an argument of the fronted verbal complex that is saturated in the _ mittelfeld_. this is the case in pollards account .",
    "hinrichs and nakazawa have to block this case by stating type constraints on lists of attracted arguments . with a separate vcomp feature",
    "this problem disappears .      in this section",
    ", i will address a problem that seems to have gone unnoticed until now .",
    "all analyses that involve argument attraction admit signs with underspecified comps lists . so in ( [ bsp - erzaehlen - wird ] ) ,",
    "_ wird _ is combined with a trace or a lexical rule is applied to it .",
    "the loc value of the verbal complement is put into slash and the arguments of the verbal complement are attracted by the matrix verb .",
    "this list of arguments , however , is not instantiated in the resulting sign .",
    "it remains variable until the slash element becomes bound .",
    "therefore , the hpsg principles admit any kind of combination of totally unrelated signs . since the comps list of the head is variable , any constituent is a possible complement . as an hpsg theory",
    "is assumed to be a set of constraints that describe well formed descriptions of linguistic objects , this is clearly not wanted .",
    "if a grammar contains phonologically empty elements ( traces , relativizers , and the like ) the set of ill - formed signs will be infinite because _ wird _ @xmath4 _ could be combined with arbitrarily many empty elements .",
    "it is clear that we want the matrix verb to behave in a very well defined way .",
    "it shall attract exactly the arguments of the fronted verbal projection that were not saturated by this projection , i.e. , the matrix verb shall perform the argument attraction that would take place in base position , abstracting away from the value of lex .",
    "the desired effect can be reached if a rule schema is used for the introduction of nonlocal dependencies . to introduce a nonlocal dependency for a verbal complex",
    ", this schema requires an additional licensing condition to be met .",
    "the extracted element is licensed by an actually existing verbal projection in the string .",
    "when a hearer of a sentence hears the words that have to be combined with a trace or introduce the nonlocal dependency in another way , he or she has already heard the phrase actually located in the _",
    "vorfeld_. therefore , the information about the nonlocal dependency is present and can be used to license the extracted element .",
    "the comps list of the extracted element therefore is specified .",
    "the specified comps are attracted by the matrix verb and the comps list of the matrix verb therefore does not contain any variables and our theory does not admit signs that do nt describe linguistic objects .",

    "a verbal complement of a matrix verb is saturated .",
    "the vcomp value of the resulting sign is _",
    "none_. the loc value of the saturated verbal complement is moved into slash .",
    "this loc value is licensed by another verbal projection that meets the local requirements of the matrix verb but may be positioned in the _ vorfeld_. as there are no constraints for daughters to be adjacent to each other , there may be an arbitrary number of constituents between the licensing daughter and the head daughter .",
    "the licensing daughter has licensing function only and is not inserted into the domain of the resulting sign ( ) at this point of combination .",
    "however , an appropriate sign is inserted into the domain of its head when the nonlocal dependency is bound .",
    "the drawback of the approaches of pollard ( to appear ) and nerbonne ( 1994 ) are discussed in ( hinrichs and nakazawa , 1994b ) .",
    "i will not repeat the arguments against these approaches here .",
    "instead , i will explain some of the problems of the hinrichs and nakazawa approach .",
    "hinrichs and nakazawa changed the value of slash into a set of signs rather than _ local _ objects .",
    "the fronted phrase is a maximal projection with the missing constituents moved to slash .",
    "the fronted partial phrase is the filler for a nonlocal dependency which is introduced by their pvp - topicalization lexical rule . as",
    "slash elements are signs , the lexical rule can refer to the slash set of a slash element and it is thus possible to establish a relation between the comps list of the auxiliary and the slash set of the fronted verbal projection .",
    "however , the assumption that slash contains signs rather than local objects is a change of the basic hpsg formalism with far reaching consequences that is not really needed and that has some side effects .    in the following ,",
    "i discuss two problems for this approach .",
    "firstly , it is not possible to account for cases where a modifier in the _ mittelfeld _ modifies the fronted verbal projection without assuming an infinite lexicon because the only way for a modifier to stay in the _ mittelfeld _ while the modified constituent is fronted is that the modifier is contained in the slash set of the fronted constituent .",
    "it therefore had to be a member of the comps list .",
    "an infinite lexicon is both not very nice from a conceptual point of view and an implementational problem . without a complex control strategy ( late evaluation )",
    "it is not possible to implement an infinite lexicon .",
    "another problem that was pointed out by hinrichs and nakazawa themselves is sentences like ( ) . in ( ) , _ sie _ is extracted from the complement sentence of _ gewut _ and than inserted into the comps list of _ habe _ and saturated in the _ mittelfeld_.",
    "the same problem arises for other constructions involving nonlocal dependencies .",
    "a very simple solution for the pvp problem was found . a minor change in the feature geometry of signs was sufficient to cope with the spurious ambiguity problem of pollard s account .",
    "the account argued for in this paper can describe the fronting phenomena without the assumption of an infinite lexicon . a solution for the problem of underspecified comps lists was found .",
    "this solution makes use of a schema to introduce the nonlocal dependency .",
    "an introduced nonlocal dependency is licensed by an actually present element in the syntax analysis of a string . at the point of combination , this element plays a licensing role only and does not appear in the surface string of the build sign .",
    "this is possible because two different levels of representation for combinatorial and order information are used .",
