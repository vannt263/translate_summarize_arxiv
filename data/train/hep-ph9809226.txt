    "heavy quark effective field theory ( hqet )  @xcite has become a well established theoretical tool for the description of hadrons containing one heavy quark  @xcite .",
    "this derives from the fact that it is a systematic expansion in inverse powers of the heavy quark mass @xmath1 with well defined and calculable coefficients .",
    "furthermore , its realization of the spin and flavor symmetry of the low energy theory is a phenomenologically powerful tool .",
    "the @xmath2 expansion has already been applied sucessfully to problems such as the determination of @xmath3 .",
    "besides its phenomenological application hqet posseses interesting theoretical features which already show up if one studies the hqet lagrangian itself . on one hand",
    "it is relevant for power corrections to the @xmath4 expansion of hadron masses and on the other hand allows for a study of reparametrization invariance @xcite .",
    "this new symmetry of hqet is associated with the fact , that qcd greensfunctions only depend on the full heavy quark momentum @xmath5 independent from its decomposition in on shell momentum @xmath6 and residual momentum @xmath7 in terms of which hqet is defined .",
    "this means , that an infinitesimal change of the velocity @xmath8 can be compensated by an appropriate change of the residual momentum @xmath9 corresponding to a transformation @xmath10 of the heavy quark field . as long as @xmath11 this change of the velocity does not violate the condition @xmath12 on which the construction of hqet relies .",
    "there is no unique way to define hqet since a redefinition of the heavy quark field leads to an equivalent formulation of hqet due to the equivalence theorem .",
    "the equivalent formulations of hqet differ from each other by operators vanishing by the equation of motion ( eom ) of the heavy quark .",
    "for example in the foldy ",
    "wouthuysen formulation which is used in nrqcd applications these operators serve to remove all covariant time derivatives from the lagrangian .",
    "however , if these unphysical operators are removed consistently , one ends with a unique minimal lagrangian consisting only of physical operators . by definition a physical operator contains no @xmath13 or @xmath14term . in general the reparametrization transformation of the heavy quark field",
    "depends on what specific formulation of hqet has been choosen .",
    "given the transformation @xmath15 associated with a certain formulation of hqet at tree level it is easy to verify that the corresponding lowest order lagrangian is reparametrization invariant .",
    "however the question arises if the tree level transformation suffices if radiative corrections are included in the lagrangian . from usual symmetries , e.g. gauge symmetries ,",
    "it is well known that in each order of perturbation theory the brs  transformations and the slavnov identities have to be renormalized .",
    "accidentally this seems not to be the case for reparametrization invariance at least if power corrections higher than @xmath16 are excluded .",
    "several authors @xcite have verified explicitly that to this order reparametrization invariance holds if the tree level transformation is used even in the presence of radiative corrections . in @xcite reparametrization invariance of the nrqcd lagrangian at @xmath17 has been studied . however , a direct comparison with our results is not possible since we are working in different hqet  formulations .",
    "recently all coefficients of the effective lagrangian at @xmath18 including eom ",
    "operators have become available @xcite .",
    "it is the subject of this paper to extend the analysis of reparametrization invariance to this order .",
    "it will be shown , that the above naive understanding of reparametrization invariance fails and how the emerging inconsistencies can be cured .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : lag ] we present the effective lagrangian in the formulation introduced by mannel , roberts and ryczak ( mrr ) @xcite and the field redefinition which removes the operators vanishing by the equation of motion . in section [ sec : ri ] we introduce the concept of reparametrization invariance and derive a relation between reparametrization transformations associated with different formulations of hqet .",
    "sections [ sec : rimrr ] and [ sec : riphys ] apply this formalism to the mrr lagrangian and the minimal lagrangian .",
    "finally we present our conclusions in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "hqet can be derived from the qcd lagrangian @xmath19 by reparametrization of the heavy quark field @xmath20 in terms of its particle and antiparticle components : @xmath21 in order to formulate an effective theory for the particle degree of freedom @xmath22 the heavy degree of freedom @xmath23 has to be integrated out .",
    "this yields the nonlocal lagrangian @xmath24 accordingly the matching condition ( [ eq : match ] ) becomes nonlocal : @xmath25 here @xmath26 acts on the transverse degrees of freedom .",
    "the expansion of ( [ eq : lagmrrnl ] ) in powers of the inverse heavy quark mass @xmath27 yields the well known tree level lagrangian @xmath28 however the procedure which leads to the lagrangian ( [ eq : lagmrrl ] ) is not unique since one can switch to another formulation of hqet by an appropriate field redefinition without affecting matrix elements ( see below ) .",
    "what formulation is chosen is more or less a matter of convenience",
    ". therefore we will refer to the formulation of hqet based on the lagrangian ( [ eq : lagmrrl ] ) as mrr  hqet .    in the presence of radiative corrections ( [ eq : lagmrrl ] ) generalizes to @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a sum of operators multiplied by short distance coefficients .",
    "a redefinition of the field @xmath31 implies a reordering of the @xmath4expansion and consequently a mixing of the coefficients .",
    "this means that in general the decomposition ( [ eq : lagn ] ) is not unique but depends on what specific formulation of hqet has been chosen .    under renormalization",
    "the set of operators in the tree level lagrangian ( [ eq : lagmrrl ] ) has to be completed to an operator basis .",
    "this basis in general has to include operators which vanish by the lowest order equation of motion @xmath32 ( eom ) , since these operators are needed as counterterms of physical operators . at the highest order @xmath33",
    "to which the @xmath4expansion is extended one can forget about eom ",
    "operators completely .",
    "however , their presence at a certain lower @xmath33 affects the coefficients in the orders beyond if the eom ",
    "operators are removed from the lagrangian . there",
    "exist several procedures how to remove these operators consistently , each of them leading to the same unique minimal lagrangian and @xmath34 to construct the operator basis . if instead @xmath35 and @xmath34 are used eom ",
    "operators are `` hidden '' in the @xmath36piece of @xmath35 and a decomposition into operators vanishing or non  vanishing by the eom is not obvious . ] which does not depend on the specific formulation of hqet one starts with .    in the present paper this will be done by an appropriate field redefinition",
    ". however , first of all in every @xmath33 a complete off shell operator basis including eom operators has to be renormalized .    in the present paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to the one loop renormalization of the operator bases appearing up to @xmath0 .",
    "the set of operators up to mass dimension 7 is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the combinations of covariant derivatives defined in table 1 .",
    "to keep things simple we disregard four fermion operators and pure gluonic operators .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ eq : lagmrrgen ] ) can be written as    @xmath39   h_{v } \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    .operators up to @xmath0 and their coefficients at tree level and @xmath40 .",
    "the operators of mass dimensions 5 , 6 and 7 are denoted @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively and the corresponding expressions have to be sandwiched between heavy quark spinors .",
    "we use @xmath44 as gauge parameter . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "comparison with table 1 shows that the coefficients @xmath45 of the physical operators at @xmath33 and @xmath16 are not affected by the redefinition ( [ eq : redef ] ) whereas the coefficients at @xmath17 are modified . in particular new operators",
    "appear already at tree level and the one loop contributions are now independent of the gauge parameter , which is a crucial property of coefficients of physical operators .",
    "note that in order to remove the eom operators appearing at one loop order in the renormalized lagrangian one has to include terms of @xmath46 in the field redefinition ( [ eq : redef ] ) .",
    "in other words the tree level field redefinition will not suffice to remove all eom operators from the lagrangian once radiative corrections are included .",
    "let us shortly comment on other methods which may reduce the mrr ",
    "lagrangian ( [ eq : mrrlag ] ) to the minimal lagrangian ( [ eq : physlag ] ) .    on the level of matrix elements",
    "the reduction effectively takes place if insertions of the eom  operators in the lagrangian ( [ eq : mrrlag ] ) into time ordered products are properly taken care of by contraction identities @xcite @xmath47 which allow to remove these unphysical t  products in favour of local operators .",
    "this procedure corresponds to a reorganisation of the @xmath4expansion and is equivalent to a field redefinition .",
    "an alternative method applies the full eom of the heavy quark , i.e. the eom derived from the lagrangian ( [ eq : mrrlag ] ) including power corrections @xmath48 to the eom operators in the mrr ",
    "lagrangian itself . this way these operators",
    "are related to operators of higher dimension and the @xmath2expansion and the coefficients are reshuffeld .",
    "we have checked explicitly that all three methods , i.e. field redefinition , the use of contraction identities and application of the full eom , yield the same minimal lagrangian ( [ eq : physlag ] ) .",
    "the greensfunctions of qcd only depend on the full heavy quark momentum independent from its decomposition into on  shell component @xmath49 and residual heavy quark momentum in terms of which hqet is defined .",
    "this is reflected in hqet by a new symmetry , the reparametrization invariance .",
    "a change of the velocity @xmath8 , @xmath50 , is accompanied by an appropriate change of the heavy quark field @xmath51 such that the hqet lagrangian is invariant . in general",
    "the field transformation @xmath52 depends on the specific formulation of hqet . in this section",
    "we derive a description how the transformation has to be modified if we switch to a different formulation of hqet by means of a field redefinition .",
    "the mrr  lagrangian ( [ eq : mrrlag ] ) is unphysical in the sense , that it contains operators vanishing by the heavy quark eom which have to be removed carefully to extract the final minimal lagrangian ( [ eq : physlag ] ) .",
    "what makes the mrr ",
    "lagrangian interesting is that it deduces from the qcd lagrangian in the most direct and simple way . in order to investigate reparametrization invariance which is a genuine property of qcd itself we therefore study first of all the mrr  lagrangian .",
    "suppose the lagrangian in the mrr formulation @xmath53 is invariant under the reparametrization transformation @xmath54 in general @xmath55 has an expansion in powers @xmath4 and @xmath56 .",
    "its concrete form is irrelevant for the more general consideration in this section and will be specified in section [ sec : rimrr ] .    in terms of",

    "show explicitly that the minimal lagrangian ( [ eq : physlag ] ) is reparametrization invariant .",
    "from the reparametrization invariance of the tree level matching condition ( [ eq : matchnl ] ) @xmath66 we derive the reparametrization transformation at tree level : @xmath67h_{v}\\ ] ] the second term in the square brackets is irrelevant since @xmath68 .",
    "we have included in the mrr  lagrangian ( [ eq : mrrlag ] ) terms up to @xmath17 .",
    "since @xmath69 the field reparametrization ( [ eq : ritrafotree ] ) must be known up to @xmath16 .",
    "a short calculation shows that the tree level mrr ",
    "lagrangian , i.e. ( [ eq : mrrlag ] ) with @xmath70 is invariant under the transformation ( [ eq : ritrafotree ] ) , i.e. its variation is @xmath17 .",
    "the question is now , if ( [ eq : ritrafotree ] ) is the correct transformation formula if radiative corrections are included in the lagrangian .",
    "in fact the tree level transformation ( [ eq : ritrafotree ] ) leaves the one loop effective lagrangian invariant as long as power corrections not higher than @xmath16 are included . in this case the term of @xmath16 in ( [ eq : ritrafotree ] ) is irrelevant .",
    "however this situation changes drastically if power corrections of @xmath0 or higher are taken into account .",
    "the inconsistency shows up if we require reparametrization invariance of the lagrangian ( [ eq : mrrlag ] ) under the tree level transformation ( [ eq : ritrafotree ] ) to all orders in the strong coupling .",
    "then the shortdistance coefficients @xmath71 , @xmath72 , must fulfill the following relations : @xmath73 if the tree level reparametrization transformation ( [ eq : ritrafotree ] ) is the correct transformation even in the presents of radiative corrections all @xmath74 have to vanish . a deviation form",
    "this value would signal reparametrization invariance breaking .",
    "insertion of the coefficients in table 1 shows that 5 of the relations involving coefficients of operators at @xmath17 are violated at @xmath46 : @xmath75 obviously the naive understanding of reparametrization invariance that the tree level transformation remains correct even if radiative corrections are included in the lagrangian fails beyond @xmath76 .",
    "however , the violation of reparametrization invariance can be cured if the reparametrization transformation itself is renormalized , i.e. is supplemented by @xmath40corrections .",
    "since the tree level transformation works well up to @xmath16 the term of @xmath16 in ( [ eq : ritrafotree ] ) which is responsible for the relations between @xmath17 and the lower orders has to be corrected at @xmath46 .",
    "it comes out that ( [ eq : ritrafotree ] ) generalizes to @xmath77h_{v}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 with @xmath79 in ( [ eq : ritrafo1 ] ) the expression in square brackets coincides with the operator @xmath55 in ( [ eq : ritrafomrr ] ) .",
    "one may argue that one can always find a transformation formular similar to ( [ eq : ritrafo1 ] ) which leaves the lagrangian invariant whatever values the coefficients @xmath80 take .",
    "however this argument fails , since in the transformation formula at @xmath16 there are in general only 4 terms which can be modified to correct all possible violated relations in ( [ eq : mrrrel ] ) .",
    "for example in our case the correction of only two terms in the transformation formula suffices to recover reparametrization invariance .",
    "now we are in the position to combine the results of the previous sections to calculate the reparametrization transformation of the `` physical '' heavy quark field @xmath81 . inserting ( [ eq : redef],[eq : redefinv ] ) and ( [ eq : ritrafo1 ] ) into ( [ eq : ritrafophys ] ) and keeping only terms up to @xmath16 and @xmath46 we get @xmath82h_{v}^{(p)}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 with @xmath84 note that the gauge parameter dependent terms in ( [ eq : cphys ] ) cancels if the transformation formula is applied to the lagrangian .",
    "we have checked that the minimal lagrangian ( [ eq : physlag ] ) is indeed invariant under ( [ eq : ritrafophys1 ] ) .",
    "the reparametrization transformation ( [ eq : ritrafophys1 ] ) of the physical heavy quark field receives one loop corrections already at @xmath33 which is not the case for the transformation ( [ eq : ritrafo1 ] ) of the mrr  lagrangian . from this",
    "we expect , that to one loop order reparametrization invariance of the minimal lagrangian is already broken at @xmath16 .",
    "let us therefore in analogy to section [ sec : rimrr ] derive the relations among the coefficients @xmath85 which have to hold if we require the minimal lagrangian ( [ eq : physlag ] ) to be invariant under the tree level reparametrization transformation ( i.e. ( [ eq : ritrafophys1 ] ) with @xmath70 ) to all orders in perturbation theory : @xmath86 invariance under the tree level reparametrization transformation requires @xmath87 . inserting the coefficents @xmath85 from table 2 shows that all relations hold at tree level but",
    "some are violated at @xmath46 : @xmath88 again the naive understanding of reparametrization invariance fails and in order to maintain reparametrization invariance one has to add corrections of @xmath46 to the tree level transformation .",
    "we have explicitly checked that ( [ eq : ritrafophys1 ] ) leaves the minimal lagrangian invariant if the one loop corrections in ( [ eq : cphys ] ) are included in the transformation .    in case of the mrr  lagrangian the naive application of reparametrization invariance accidentally works well up to @xmath16 , while in case of the minimal lagrangian it leads to inconsistencies already appearing at lower orders .",
    "namely the third and the ninth relation in ( [ eq : physrel ] ) would imply non renormalization of the operator @xmath89 ( darwin operator ) and the chromomagnetic operator @xmath90 .",
    "however , the usual renormalization group approach yields non vanishing radiative corrections for the coefficients of these operators .",
    "we have extended the analysis of the reparametrization invariance of hqet to @xmath0 .",
    "we have shown explicitly that the reparametrization transformation depends on the specific formulation of hqet and that the transformation has to be modified if one switches to another formulation .",
    "as examples we have studied the mrr  formulation and the minimal lagrangian .",
    "the main subject of this paper , however , was the question if and in what sense reparametrization invariance is maintained under renormalization .",
    "we have demonstrated explicitly that the naive understanding of reparametrization invariance ",
    "application of the tree level transformation to the renormalized lagrangian",
    " fails if higher orders @xmath2 as well as radiative corrections are included . in the case of the mrr ",
    "lagrangian accidentally the tree ",
    "level transformation works well up to @xmath76 but fails at @xmath0 .",
    "by contrast , in case of the physical lagrangian an inconsistency already appears at @xmath76 .    in order to recover reparametrization invariance of both the mrr ",
    "lagrangian ( [ eq : mrrlag ] ) and the physical lagrangian ( [ eq : physlag ] ) in the presence of radiative corrections the corresponding field transformations @xmath15 and @xmath91 have to be renormalized properly .",
    "however , given the correct transformation formula in one formulation of hqet the corresponding transformation in any other formulation related to the first by means of a field redefiniton is fixed by ( [ eq : ritrafophys ] ) .",
    "to summarize , the application of reparametrization invariance at higher orders of the @xmath2expansion in order to extract short distance coefficients from lower order calculations has to be treated with care , since the transformation prescription depends on what specific formulation of hqet has been chosen and requires renormalization if radiative corrections are included in the effective lagrangian .",
