    "scattering of laser light from fast moving electrons ( in this paper referred to as thomson scattering or ts ) is a widely used source of x- and gamma - ray photons  @xcite .",
    "applications include photon sources of percent - level bandwidth for nuclear resonance fluorescence or photofission ( @xcite and references therein ) , for radiography  @xcite and for medical applications  @xcite .",
    "thomson sources monochromaticity , wide - range tunability ( depending on the energy of the electrons in the beam ) and directionality provide important advantages over bremsstrahlung sources .    applications of thomson sources require high photon fluxes , which is challenging due to the small thomson cross section .",
    "the total number of electrons that can be accelerated in a bunch is limited for the high quality bunches required to produce narrow bandwidth sources .",
    "for example , laser plasma accelerator are typically near @xmath0  @xcite , and conventional linacs are typically in the same range for low emittances  @xcite . scattering laser performance and geometry are then principal tools for achieving the required fluxes .",
    "the produced photon yield is proportional to the product of @xmath1 with the scattering laser intensity and pulse length .",
    "the need to match the laser diffraction range to its pulse length ( to keep intensity constant over the scattering volume ) , has meant that increasing yield by increasing laser pulse length costs quadratically in laser energy .",
    "for example , to double yield , pulse length must double and diffraction range must also double , requiring the spot size to increase by @xmath2 .",
    "this makes it desirable to scatter at high laser intensity in order to maximize yield at reasonable laser energy cost .    scattering laser intensity",
    "is strongly limited by the fact that the generated spectrum can be broadened and band - like structure can appear in the fundamental frequency as well as its harmonics  @xcite even for rather low values of laser pulse amplitude @xmath3 on the order of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are charge and mass of the positron respectively , @xmath7 is the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath8 is the laser vector potential amplitude .",
    "this is a detrimental and limiting effect in the cases when a narrow bandwidth gamma or x - ray sources is essential , especially in the case of nuclear resonance fluorescence for active nuclear interrogation .",
    "it puts a limit on the maximum laser intensity and thus maximum laser pulse amplitude @xmath9 that can be used for obtaining a certain fwhm bandwidth of the photon source .",
    "for example , such _ moderate _ laser pulse amplitude as @xmath10 already leads to broadening on the order of 4@xmath11 .",
    "the limit on intensity is an important driver of the laser energy and hence cost of a thomson source : producing one photon per electron costs 1.6 joules of laser energy at @xmath12 , but only 0.4 j at @xmath13 .",
    "limited sets of parameters have been found to minimize the nonlinear effects have been suggested based on shaping of the laser pulse temporal envelope .",
    "@xcite    showed that a flat top longitudinal intensity profile could reduce the effects of nonlinearity , but this approach is typically limited by the diffraction range of the laser pulse .",
    "in fact , fels work using undulator strength parameters @xmath9 on the order of unity for the optimal photon yield .",
    "three - dimensional effects that appear due to tight laser pulse focusing can be also detrimental in ts as discussed by hartemann  _ et al _  @xcite . ideally one would need laser pulses having near flat - top distribution in all dimensions .",
    "et al _  @xcite have proposed controlling the shape of the photon spectrum using laser pulse chirping and demonstrated it using a single set of numerical simulations , and such simulations have been extended by terzic _ et al _  @xcite and the latter results were published while this manuscript was being prepared .",
    "there is however need for an analytical framework and solutions for nonlinear broadening , spectral shape , and compensation of these effects using laser pulse shaping in amplitude and frequency to obtain narrow bandwidth .    in this manuscript",
    "we derive analytical expressions for the spectrum of the nonlinear thomson scattering for both the case of the unchirped and chirped pulses and compare them to the results of numerical integration .",
    "we demonstrate that proper laser pulse chirping leads to bandwidth narrowing for arbitrarily large laser pulse amplitudes .",
    "this allows design of sources for narrow bandwidth together with high efficiency , without scanning of numerical parameters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ broadening ] a physical explanation of the spectrum broadening and appearance of the sub - structures in the spectrum is provided .",
    "analytical expressions for the nonlinear thomson scattering spectrum are derived and compared with the results of the numerical integration . in sec .",
    "[ chirping_sec ] this analysis is extended to show that the laser frequency - versus - time dependence , or chirp , can be used to compensate for nonlinear effects and to narrow the spectrum even for high intensity lasers .",
    "finally , discussions and conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "[ discussion_sec ] .",
    "spectral broadening and appearance of sub - structures due to the nonlinear effects in thomson scattering has been reported in several previous works @xcite .",
    "of note is that this process is also alternately referred to as compton scattering in the literature , but as we neglect the recoil on electrons in this analysis we use the term thomson scattering herein .",
    "the appearance of substructures was identified to be due to constructive and destructive interference of radiation emitted from different electron positions within the scattering laser pulse . here",
    "we begin by reviewing this physical explanation of the shape of the spectrum , then derive the shape of the spectrum analytically and compare it to that obtained via numerical integration .",
    "in addition to providing analytic derivation of the spectrum , this will serve as the basis for the derivation of compensation techniques required to produce narrow bandwidth at high intensity .    as is common practice , we work here in the frame of reference where an electron is initially at rest and",
    "the electromagnetic laser wave impinges it .",
    "results presented can be immediately applied to the case of scattering from the electron moving with arbitrary speed ( e.g. a relativistic electron beam ) by using lorentz transform .",
    "similarly , we use a circularly polarized scattering laser as it allows us to obtain analytical expressions for the spectrum similar to solutions derived by hartemann _",
    "et al _  @xcite . in terms of number of generated photons",
    "there is no difference for the case of pulses with different polarizations with same energy .",
    "the case of linear polarization can be modeled in the straightforward way using numerical integration  @xcite .",
    "the spectrum produced is considerably broadened in the case of the strong laser pulse , and a band - like structure appears as shown in fig .",
    "[ schematic_figure ]  ( left ) for @xmath14 , as compared with the linear case @xmath15 ( in this case @xmath16 ) .",
    "this can be understood qualitatively from the equation describing the frequency of the photon reflected from an electron which for the case of on - axis scattering and assuming circular laser polarization is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 being the generated and laser frequencies respectively both in cgs units .",
    "the convention used in this paper is that circular polarized laser pulse has twice the energy of the linearly polarized laser pulse with same @xmath9 , so that in the case of linear polarization the frequency is given by @xmath21 .",
    "note also that eq .",
    "( [ generated_freq_eq ] ) can also be used for the case of the electron moving with relativistic speed with the only difference that @xmath20 must be replaced with @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the relativistic gamma factor of the electron .",
    "the @xmath24 term in the denominator comes from the fact that an electron is pushed by the electromagnetic wave in the direction of its propagation , and thus moves away from the laser red shifting the reflected light .",
    "movement of the electron through the focus of the laser and/or pulsing of the laser beam result in @xmath9 being a function of time representing the laser envelope .",
    "this in turn means that during the laser pulse interaction with an electron , different frequencies are generated at different times and different electron positions within the envelope , broadening the emitted spectrum .",
    "this is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ schematic_figure ]  ( right ) .",
    "one can also see that certain frequencies are generated twice during the interaction .",
    "for example , the frequency @xmath25 is generated at two different longitudinal positions of the electron @xmath26 and @xmath27 as shown .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath25 and the separation between the emission points this leads to either constructive or destructive interference in the generated spectrum .",
    "these interference patterns lead the appearance of bands in the spectrum .",
    "the number of oscillations in the spectrum can be approximately established as a ratio of maximum frequency broadening due to laser intensity derived from eq .",
    "( [ generated_freq_eq ] ) and given by @xmath28 and the bandwidth of the laser pulse .",
    "thus , the number of oscillations is roughly given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the fwhm bandwidth of the laser .",
    "one can see that the number of interference fringes in the spectrum grows with increase of both the laser amplitude and laser pulse duration ( as laser bandwidth is back proportional to laser duration ) .",
    "the exact shape of the spectrum depends on the laser pulse duration and on its envelope shape and intensity , and can be calculated from the well known motion of a free electron in the plane electromagnetic wave  @xcite . here",
    ", we neglect the radiation reaction so that the electron dynamics is governed by the standard lorentz force . for an electron initially at rest and for an electromagnetic wave impinging the electron from the @xmath31 , one can immediately write two integrals of motion for the electron : @xmath32 the latter equation can be also be written in the following form : @xmath33 here @xmath34 is any perpendicular to @xmath35-axis electron momentum component , @xmath36 - any perpendicular component of the vector potential , @xmath37 is the electron longitudinal momentum component .",
    "it is easy to show that for the observer looking exactly on - axis , the retarded time that goes into expressions for calculating the spectrum  @xcite does nt depend on @xmath38 and @xmath39 coordinates .",
    "hence , to derive the on - axis spectrum one only needs to know the @xmath35 coordinate of the electron , which can be found from the following equation : @xmath40 or , equivalently @xmath41 here , @xmath42 is the electron proper time and @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 being time and longitudinal coordinate in cgs units respectively .",
    "since the trajectory of the electron in plane electromagnetic wave is completely known , the on - axis reflected radiation produced by the electron moving in such a wave can be found using the well known formula  @xcite : @xmath46}d\\eta\\right|^2\\mathrm{,}\\label{usual_formula_eq}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the solid angle and the whole formula is evaluated for the on - axis case ( @xmath48 ) , @xmath49 is the normalization coefficient ( such that energy spectrum given by eq .  [ usual_formula_eq ] is given in cgs units ) and @xmath50 is the vector of perpendicular momentum components .",
    "using eqns .",
    "( [ u_perp_eq ] ) and ( [ z_coordinate_eq ] ) one can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ usual_formula_eq ] ) in terms of the laser amplitude : @xmath51}d\\eta\\right|^2\\mathrm{.}\\label{usual_formula_2_eq}\\ ] ] for a circularly polarized laser pulse with frequency @xmath52 the laser amplitude function can then be expressed as : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the envelope function of the pulse and @xmath55 is introduced to take into account circular polarization and @xmath56 .",
    "we will call @xmath57 - frequency of the laser pulse and @xmath58 - instantaneous frequency of the pulse . in the case of a laser pulse with constant frequency @xmath59 due to our choice of units , but we keep it in these equations to facilitate consideration of cases with chirped laser pulses .",
    "expressions for the on - axis spectrum can be obtained in the fully nonlinear case for a laser having an envelope in time described by a half - sine profile : @xmath60\\mathrm{,}\\quad\\quad0<\\eta<\\tau_l\\mathrm{,}\\label{laser_envelope_eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath61 being the duration of the laser pulse .",
    "for such a pulse , the @xmath35 coordinate of the electron can be analytically found from eq .",
    "( [ z_coordinate_eq ] ) @xmath62 the on - axis spectrum of reflected radiation can then be rewritten in the following form @xmath63 where @xmath64    numerical integration of these equations can be used to show the dependence of the spectrum on @xmath9 , as illustrated by a color - coded image of the on - axis spectrum in fig .  [",
    "numerical_an_spec_figure](left ) .",
    "the spectra are obtained from numerical integration of eq .",
    "( [ integral_eq ] ) for different @xmath9 ( vertical axis ) and for laser pulse with duration @xmath65 .",
    "one can see that for low values of @xmath9 the spectrum is narrow and is limited by the bandwidth of the incoming electromagnetic wave , whereas for large values of @xmath9 the spectrum is broad and band sub - structure is visible .",
    "the main peak of the spectrum is red - shifted and its position is given by eq .",
    "( [ generated_freq_eq ] ) ( shown with dashed line on the fig .  [ numerical_an_spec_figure ]  ( left ) ) .",
    "while numerical integration of the nonlinear spectrum has been conducted previously , analytic solutions are important to allow understanding of the mechanisms of broadening and to allow design of techniques to compensate for broadening . opening the sine functions using the euler s formula one can analytically evaluate the integral to obtain directly the nonlinear spectrum . doing so yields : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the bessel function and @xmath68 here we have neglected two small terms that are given by bessel functions with orders @xmath69 because @xmath70 typically for @xmath71 and bessel function with such orders is very small in the frequency range of interest .",
    "it is important to note that the solution is valid only for a subset of all @xmath72 where the order @xmath73 is integer . for other values of @xmath72 , numerical integration of eq .",
    "( [ integral_eq ] ) is required .",

    "( [ spec_bessel_an_eq ] ) for the frequencies @xmath72 that make the order of the bessel function an integer .",
    "one can see that analytical solution fits the numerical integration ( blue line ) very well .",
    "although the analytical solution provides only a discrete set of points , it well outlines the shape of the spectrum and gives its peak value and width which are the most important parameters for many applications .",
    "this is especially true because in many thomson scattering photon source applications the fine - scale oscillations observable for a single electron will be washed out by the nonzero energy spread of the electron beam . in the example shown here ,",
    "the oscillations have frequency spacing of @xmath752@xmath76 which will be washed out by electron energy spread of @xmath751@xmath11 .",
    "the analytic expressions then allow us to analytically evaluate broadening , and give us a tool to calculate compensating terms which can be used to control and narrow the spectrum .",
    "nonlinear broadening of the spectrum is a result of red - shifting of the thomson scattered frequency during the interaction due to the longitudinal motion of the electron , as given by eq .",
    "( [ generated_freq_eq ] ) with @xmath9 being a function of time representing the laser pulse envelope .",
    "this indicates that by compensating the laser frequency by chirping the laser pulse , one can diminish broadening of the generated spectrum .",
    "this was proposed , and simulation based on a single set of numerical parameters was provided in  @xcite , and further examples were provided by  @xcite . here",
    "we extend the analytical expressions obtained above to derive analytical expressions for the radiation spectrum in the case of proper laser pulse chirping . using appropriate laser chirp ,",
    "spectrum narrowing can be obtained for arbitrary values of laser pulse amplitude @xmath9 .",
    "the analytical results are compared with numerical integration .",
    "we consider again the circularly polarized laser pulse with the envelope given by eq .",
    "( [ laser_envelope_eq ] ) . if the frequency of the laser pulse is constant the generated frequency is given by eq .",
    "( [ generated_freq_eq ] ) , and the resulting spectra are those of fig .",
    "[ numerical_an_spec_figure ] .",
    "however , if the instantaneous frequency of the laser pulse is given by @xmath77\\mathrm{,}\\label{chirp_eq}\\ ] ] one can expect that the generated frequency will be constant and equal to one independent of the value of @xmath9 .",
    "this can be derived from the following considerations .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ total_pulse_eq ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ usual_formula_2_eq ] ) and looking at the oscillatory term of the integral @xmath78 , one can write for the @xmath79 @xmath80 we are looking for such frequency function @xmath81 that will compensate the red - shifting and force the maximum of the integral to be at @xmath82 . in order to do",
    "that @xmath79 for @xmath82 must be constant , i.e. @xmath83 , so that the integral has the maximum value .",
    "thus , @xmath84 writing @xmath85 , one can find that @xmath86 .",
    "for the phase of the properly chirped laser pulse one can thus write @xmath87 and for the instantaneous laser pulse frequency one obtains the following expression @xmath88 for the laser pulse with envelope given by eq .",

    "the spectrum width is approximately given by the unchirped ( i.e. with constant frequency , shown on the figure with black dash - dot line ) laser pulse width , which is back proportional to laser pulse duration @xmath61 . in the case of @xmath92 ( black color ) the spectrum width is approximately @xmath93 times narrower .",
    "analytical solutions fit with numerical integration well and predict spectrum narrowing for properly chirped laser pulses with arbitrarily high @xmath9 .",
    "the generated frequency stays centered at @xmath82 and the broadening disappears .",
    "one can see that the spectrum is actually getting narrower with the increase of @xmath9 .",
    "this is due to the choice of the laser pulse function . indeed , changing ( increasing compared to @xmath82 ) the frequency while keeping the duration @xmath61 constant leads to more sign changes of the vector potential of the laser pulse or , in other words , to more periods .",

    "the duration of the laser pulse was set to @xmath95 for illustrative reasons .",
    "because at each period an electron is forced ( by appropriate chirp ) to radiate the same frequency , it effectively radiates pulses with the same frequency @xmath82 but with longer duration for higher @xmath9 leading to narrower spectrum .",

    "it is worth noting that the spectrum of the incident chirped pulse extends approximately up to the frequency @xmath96 , quadratically with @xmath9 .",

    "( [ chirp_eq ] ) ( red color corresponds to @xmath10 and green color corresponds to @xmath94 ) compared to the case of the unchirped laser pulse . for low values of @xmath97",
    "the introduced chirp can be on the order of 10 - 20 percent and is achievable with current technology .",
    "this already allows production of narrow bandwidth sources using significantly higher laser intensity than is conventionally possible , which in turn reduces the required laser energy .",
    "as noted above , even operation at @xmath9=0.3 can save a factor of four in scattering laser energy .",
    "while in principle the technique can be used up to even higher intensities , practical implementation is limited by the obtainable bandwidth in the scattering laser .",
    "for example , at @xmath92 the laser pulse contains the range of wavelengths from x - rays to the laser wavelength , which is beyond currently foreseeable laser technology .",
