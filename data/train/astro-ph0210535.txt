    "any stellar system with a star formation history ( * sfh * ) more extended than a massive star s lifetime ( plus the cooling time of the gas ) will be composite not only in age but also in metallicity . indeed , broad metallicity distributions are observed in galaxies throughout ( e.g. rocha - pinto & maciel 1998 , carollo & danziger 1994 , grebel 1997 ) . with few exceptions stellar as well as gaseous metallicities",

    "the 1@xmath1 generation of stars is formed with @xmath2 .",
    "we solve a modified form of tinsley s equations with stellar yields ( snii , sni , pn , and stellar mass loss ) and lifetimes for @xmath2 to obtain the time evolution of the ism abundances of individual elements @xmath3c , ... , @xmath4fe .",
    "the next generation of stars is formed with abundances @xmath5 , and again , the modified tinsley equations are to be solved with stellar yields and lifetimes for @xmath5 , ... . via the sfh galaxy evolution and stellar evolution become intimately coupled .",
    "different sfhs  short and burst - like vs. mild and @xmath6 constant  lead to different abundance ratios between elements with different nucleosynthetic origin , as e.g. [ c / o ] , [ n / o ] , or [ @xmath7/fe ] .",
    "c and n originate in intermediate mass stars , fe has important snia contributions , both leading to a delayed production with respect to the snii products o , mg , etc . a threshold in metallicity , below which snia may be inhibited ( kobayashi _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , would further enhance this effect . in principle , stellar evolutionary tracks and yields are required not only for various metallicities ( and he contents ) , but also for various abundance ratios . however , no complete grid of stellar evolutionary tracks or yields for varying abundance ratios [ @xmath8 is available yet . *",
    "our chemically consistent ( @xmath9 * cc * ) evolutionary synthesis models follow the evolution of ism abundances together with the spectrophotometric properties of galaxies and account for the increasing initial metallicity of successive generations of stars . *    we use various sets of input physics ",
    "stellar evolutionary isochrones , model atmosphere spectra , yields , lifetimes , and remnant masses  ranging in metallicity from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "our cc models simultaneously describe the spectrophotometric * and * the chemical evolution , both as a function of time and  for any cosmological model as given by @xmath12 and a redshift of galaxy formation @xmath13  as a function of redshift .",
    "the chemo - cosmological evolution only needs a transformation ( time t @xmath14 redshift z ) .",
    "the redshift evolution of apparent magnitudes ubvrijhk and colors requires evolutionary corrections @xmath15 ( since a galaxy at @xmath16 is younger ) and cosmological corrections @xmath17 ( since its spectrum is redshifted ) .",
    "the two basic parameters of evolutionary synthesis models are the imf , for which we use salpeter , and sfhs @xmath0 , appropriate for different spectral galaxy types .",
    "sfhs are determined from the requirement that models after a hubble time simultaneously match many observed average properties of the respective galaxy types like colors , template spectra ( uv ... k ) , gas content and ism abundances .",
    "we caution that our models are simple 1-zone descriptions without dynamics or spatial resolution , meant to describe global average quantities like integrated spectra or colors , and hii region abundances around @xmath18 .",
    "they only have one gas phase , account for the lifetimes of the stars before they restore recycled gas but neglect its cooling time .",
    "being closed - box models at the present stage , they should not be used for dwarf or strong starburst galaxies with large - scale in- and outflows .",

    "1 shows the decomposition of the total light emitted by 12 gyr old e and sb models in three filter bands u , v , k into the relative contributions of stars from 5 different metallicity subpopulations .",
    "note the very broad stellar metallicity distribution in the e model , the lower contribution of metal - poor stars and the absence of @xmath11 stars in the sb model .",
    "2 shows the time evolution of the relative luminosity contributions from stars of the 5 different metallicity subpopulations in the e and sb models , respectively , to the light in v. both models start with 100 % of the v - band luminosity from the lowest metallicity stars .",
