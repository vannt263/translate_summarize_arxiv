    "we challenge in this paper a conclusion that is almost universally accepted : that quantum phenomena , relativity , and realism are incompatible .",
    "we show that , just as in the case of the no - hidden - variables theorems , this conclusion is hasty . and , as in the hidden variables case , we do so with a counterexample .",
    "we present a relativistic toy model for nonlocal quantum phenomena that avoids the usual quantum subjectivity , or fundamental appeal to an observer , and describes instead , in a rather natural way , an objective motion of particles in minkowski space .",
    "in contrast to that of @xcite , see below , our model invokes only the structure at hand : relativistic structure provided by the lorentz metric and quantum structure provided by a wave function .",
    "it shares the conceptual framework  and forms a natural generalization  of bohmian mechanics , a realistic quantum theory that accounts for all nonrelativistic quantum phenomena @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient is a mechanism for a kind of mild backwards causation , allowing only a very special sort of advanced effects , that is provably paradox - free .",
    "unfortunately , the model considered here , unlike that of @xcite , does not provide any obvious , distinguished probability measure on the set of its possible particle paths , on which many of its detailed predictions are likely to be based .",
    "it is thus difficult to assess the extent to which the model is consistent with violations of bell s inequality @xcite .",
    "however , in the nonrelativistic limit of small velocities ( and slow changes in the wave function ) , the behavior of our model coincides with that of the usual bohm ",
    "dirac model @xcite and is thus consistent with the @xmath1 distribution , and hence with violations of bell s inequality , in every frame in which the velocities are slow .",
    "the backwards causation arises from a time - asymmetric equation of motion for @xmath0 particles that involves advanced data about the other particles world lines .",
    "the asymmetry of this law defines an intrinsic arrow of time , which is not present in well - known theories like newtonian mechanics or wheeler ",
    "feynman electrodynamics , and which we call the _ microcausal arrow of time _ ,",
    "as opposed ( and , indeed , opposite ) to the usual , thermodynamic or _ macrocausal arrow of time_.    in a recent paper @xcite , l.  s.  schulman investigated the possibility of opposite thermodynamic arrows of time in different regions of the universe : that in some distant galaxy , entropy might _ decrease _ with ( our ) time , `` eggs uncrack , '' and inhabitants , if present , feel the arrow of time to be just opposite to what we feel .",
    "he studied this question in terms of statistical mechanics , and , on the ground of computer simulations , came to the conclusion that this is quite possible , apparent causal paradoxes notwithstanding .",
    "we also consider two opposite arrows of time , but not belonging to different regions of space - time , and not as a study in statistical mechanics , but as a possible explanation of quantum nonlocality . instead of having the thermodynamic arrow of time vary within one universe",
    ", we consider the situation in which two conceptually different arrows of time , the microcausal and the macrocausal arrow , are everywhere opposite throughout the entire universe .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that in order to account for quantum nonlocality , one employ ",
    "contrary to the spirit of relativity  a time - foliation , i.e. , a foliation of space - time into 3-dimensional spacelike hypersurfaces , which serve to define a temporal order for spacelike separated points , or one might say simultaneity - at - a - distance , and hence simultaneity surfaces along which nonlocal effects propagate .",
    "this foliation is intended to be understood , not as a gauge ( i.e. , as one among many points of view a physicist may choose ) , but as an additional element of space - time structure existing objectively out there in the universe , defining in effect a notion of true simultaneity . in @xcite ,",
    "the time - foliation is itself a dynamical variable subject to an evolution law .",
    "in contrast , the model we present here does not invoke a distinguished foliation .    in our model , the formula for",
    "the velocity of a particle at space - time point @xmath2 involves , in a lorentz - invariant manner , the points where the world lines of the other particles intersect  not any `` simultaneity surface '' containing @xmath2 but rather  the future light cone of @xmath2 , as well as the velocities of the particles at these points . as a consequence ,",
    "it is easy to compute the past world lines from the future world lines , but it is not at all obvious how to compute the future from the past  except by testing all the uncountably many possibilities .",
    "one can say that the behavior of a particle at time @xmath3 has causes that lie in the future of @xmath3 , so that on the microscopic level of individual particles and their world lines , the arrow of time of causation , as defined by the dynamics , points towards the past .",
    "we call this the _ microcausal arrow of time _ and denote it by @xmath4 ; it defines a notion of `` @xmath5 '' = past , and of `` @xmath6 '' = future .",
    "thus the velocity of a particle depends on where the other particles intersect the @xmath6 light cone of that particle ( effects are `` retarded@xmath7 '' ) .",
    "this microcausal arrow of time is also an arrow of determinism : knowledge of the world lines prior@xmath7 to a certain time determines the @xmath5 , whereas there is no reason to believe the converse , that the @xmath5 determines the @xmath6 .",
    "now consider the set of solutions of the law of motion as given , and consider those solutions which at a certain time @xmath8 in the distant @xmath5 reside in a certain macrostate with low entropy .",
    "we are interested in their behavior for times prior@xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "one should expect that entropy decreases in the direction of @xmath4 until it reaches its minimum at @xmath8 .",
    "so the thermodynamic arrow of time @xmath9 , as defined by the direction of entropy increase , is opposite to @xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "[ arrowf2 ] ) .",
    "end of time .",
    "( the time direction is vertical . ) ]    the arrow of time that inhabitants of this imaginary world would perceive as natural is the one corresponding to eggs cracking rather than uncracking , that is , the thermodynamic one .",
    "so when the inhabitants speak of the future , they mean @xmath10 .",
    "that is why we called @xmath6 the future in the beginning .",
    "it is @xmath9 that corresponds to macroscopic causality .",
    "the law of motion is lorentz - invariant , and since it involves retarded@xmath7 but not advanced@xmath7 influences , it is local with respect to @xmath4 , i.e.  what is happening at a space - time point @xmath2 depends only on what happened within ( and on ) the @xmath6 light cone of @xmath2 . with respect to @xmath9 , however , the law of motion is _ nonlocal _ , as the trajectory of a particle at @xmath2 depends on where and how the other particles cross the @xmath11 light cone of @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "[ arrowf4 ] ) , which again might be influenced by interventions of macroscopic experimenters at spacelike separation from @xmath2 .",
    "so this law of motion provides an example of a theory that entails nonlocality ( superluminal influences ) while remaining fully lorentz - invariant .     depends on where the world lines of the other particles cross the @xmath6 light cone of @xmath2 , and on the 4-velocities at these points . ]",
    "it is important here to appreciate that the thermodynamic arrow of time arises not from any microscopic time asymmetry , but from boundary conditions of the universe .",
    "that is a moral of boltzmann s analysis of the emergence of the thermodynamic arrow of time from a time symmetric microscopic dynamics , where no microscopic time arrow is available as a basis of macroscopic asymmetry . as a consequence ,",
    "the microscopic asymmetry present in our model should not affect the thermodynamic arrow @xmath9 at all , and we should be free to choose the direction of @xmath9 as either the same as or opposite to @xmath4 , by imposing low - entropy boundary conditions at either the distant past@xmath7 or future@xmath7 when setting up the model .",
    "the advantage of having them opposite is that this allows our model to display _ nonlocal _ behavior .",
    "had we chosen @xmath9 to be in the same direction as @xmath4 , then the model would have been _",
    "local_because then what happens at @xmath2 would depend only on what had happened in the past light cone of @xmath2 .",
    "now let us turn to the details of the model .",
    "it is similar to bohmian mechanics @xcite , in the sense that velocities are determined by a wave function . in our case ,",
    "the wave function is an @xmath0 particle dirac spinor field , i.e. , a mapping @xmath12 .",
    "we consider entanglement , but without interaction .",
    "the wave function is supposed to be a solution of the multi - time dirac equation @xmath13 where summation is understood for @xmath14 but not for @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the mass parameter , @xmath17 the charge parameter , @xmath18 are the dirac matrices , @xmath19 is an arbitrary given 1-form ( the external electromagnetic vector potential ) , and @xmath15 runs from 1 through @xmath0 enumerating the particles .    for any space - time point @xmath2 and any parametrized timelike curve @xmath20 ,",
    "let @xmath21 denote the value .",
    "but we will ignore this problem here .",
    "] of @xmath22 such that @xmath20 lies on the @xmath6 light cone of @xmath2 .",
    "our law of motion demands of the world lines @xmath23 of the @xmath0 particles that ( a ) they be timelike and ( b ) for every particle @xmath15 and parameter value @xmath24 , @xmath25 where @xmath26 means `` is parallel to '' ( i.e.  is a multiple of ) , @xmath27 , @xmath28 refers to the @xmath29 world line , @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the minkowski metric , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are evaluated at @xmath34 .    here is what the law says .",
    "suppose that space - time point @xmath35 is on the world line of particle @xmath15 .",
    "then the velocity of particle @xmath15 at @xmath35 is given as follows : find the points of intersection @xmath36 of the world lines of the other particles with the @xmath6 light cone of @xmath35 , and let @xmath37 be the 4-velocities at these points .",
    "( it does not matter whether or not @xmath38 is normalized , @xmath39 . )",
    "evaluate the wave function at @xmath40 to obtain an element @xmath32 of @xmath41 , and compute also @xmath33 . use these to form the tensor @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 is an element of @xmath44 , where @xmath45 stands for the space - time manifold and @xmath46 denotes the tangent space at the point @xmath2 .",
    "now for all @xmath47 , transvect @xmath43 with @xmath48 .",
    "this yields an element @xmath49 of @xmath50 , defining a 1-dimensional subspace @xmath51 of @xmath50 .",
    "the world line of particle @xmath15 must be tangent to that subspace .",
    "( one easily checks that this prescription is purely geometrical : it provides a condition on the collection of space - time paths that does not depend on how they are parametrized .",
    "the velocity is not defined if @xmath52and only in that case , as we will see below . )",
    "how does one arrive at this law ? to begin with , there is an obvious extension of bohmian mechanics to a single dirac particle @xcite .",
    "let @xmath53 obey the dirac equation , let @xmath54 be the usual dirac probability current , and let the integral curves of the 4-vector field @xmath55 be the possible world lines of the particle , one of which is chosen at random .",
    "the world lines are timelike , and therefore intersect every spacelike hyperplane precisely once .",
    "if this point of intersection is @xmath1 distributed in one frame at one time , it is @xmath1 distributed in every frame at every time .",
    "that is because the dirac equation implies that @xmath55 is a conserved current , @xmath56 , and because in every frame @xmath57 . for @xmath58 ,",
    "our law of motion reproduces this single - particle law .",
    "this bohm  dirac law of motion possesses an immediate many - particle analogue if one is willing to dispense with covariance @xcite : using the simplest tensor quadratic in @xmath32 , @xmath59 , one can write @xmath60 for the velocities , where @xmath61 are simultaneous ( with respect to one preferred lorentz frame ) and @xmath22 is again an arbitrary curve parameter .",
    "this motion also conserves the probability density @xmath62 .",
    "it can be generalized @xcite to arbitrary spacelike hypersurfaces ( rather than the parallel hyperplanes corresponding to a lorentz frame ) .",
    "the hypersurfaces then play a twofold role : first , the multi - time field @xmath43 is evaluated at @xmath0 space - time points @xmath61 which are taken to lie on the same hypersurface .",
    "second , the unit normal vectors on the hypersurface are used for contracting all but one of the indices of @xmath63 to arrive at a 4-vector @xcite ; that is how the 0-components arise in ( [ bd ] ) .",
    "so ( [ eqmotion ] ) is merely a modification of known `` bohmian '' equations , using a simple strategy for avoiding the use of distinguished spacelike hypersurfaces : use light cones as the hypersurfaces for determining the @xmath0 space - time points , and use the velocity 4-vectors ( of the other particles ) for contracting all but one of the indices of @xmath43 .",
    "( if vectors normal to the light cone had been used , the model would not have a good nonrelativistic limit ; see below . )",
    "`` bohmian '' equations of motion usually imply that positions can be taken to always be @xmath1 distributed .",
    "that is what makes bohmian mechanics compatible with the empirical facts of quantum mechanics .",
    "in contrast , our velocity formula ( [ eqmotion ] ) does not conserve the @xmath1 distribution , and that is why we call it a toy model rather than a serious theory .",
    "in the nonrelativistic limit , however , our model coincides with the many - particle bohm  dirac law , since the future light cone approaches the @xmath64 hyperplane , and hence is compatible with a @xmath1 distribution , consistent with quantum mechanics .",
    "note also that , due to bell s theorem @xcite , a necessary condition for compatibility of a law of motion with the @xmath1 distribution is its nonlocality .",
    "so a necessary step towards such a law that is relativistic is to come up with a covariant method of providing nonlocality : we develop one such method here .",
    "the question remains as to whether for @xmath65 , @xmath66 is timelike .",
    "actually , it is sometimes lightlike : e.g. , for @xmath67 in the standard representation with @xmath68 , one finds that @xmath69 .",
    "but this is an exceptional case like @xmath70 . to see that @xmath66 is either timelike or lightlike , note that a vector is nonzero - timelike - or - lightlike if and only if its scalar product with every timelike vector is nonzero .",
    "so pick a nonzero timelike vector , call it @xmath71 , and compute the scalar product @xmath72 without changing the absolute value of @xmath73 , we can make sure all @xmath74s are future - pointing ( i.e.  @xmath75 ) , replacing @xmath74 by @xmath76 if necessary . through a suitable choice of @xmath0 lorentz transformations in the spaces @xmath77",
    ", we can replace all @xmath74s by @xmath78 while also replacing @xmath32 by a transformed spinor @xmath79 .",
    "thus @xmath80 unless @xmath81 , i.e. , unless @xmath70 .",
    "the model is of course very restricted in the sense that we do not allow for interaction between the particles .",
    "while it is difficult to find global solutions to this law of motion , it is quite obvious how to obtain a solution from initial@xmath7 ( = final@xmath82 ) boundary counditions : for computing the velocities of all particles at any time @xmath83 , data are needed about velocities of the particles at several earlier@xmath7 ( = later@xmath82 ) instants of time ( see fig .",
    "[ arrowf1 ] ) , and all such data are available given the world lines prior@xmath7 to ( = after@xmath82 ) @xmath84 . while propagation in our model from microcausal past to microcausal future is far from routine , it is thus ordinary enough to make it seem reasonable that there should exist a unique continuation of a given past@xmath7 to the future@xmath7 that obeys the law in that future , even if the specified past@xmath7 does not .",
    "this of course does not prove , even heuristically , the existence of global solutions , existing for all times , past , present , and future , but for our purposes this does not matter so much . for our purposes ,",
    "i.e. , for arguing for the existence of relevant solutions , it is sufficient to consider the specification of the past@xmath7 up to a certain time in the spirit of an initial ( or final ) boundary condition , from which evolution takes place .",
    ", information about several space - time points , lying at different times , is relevant : where the crossing points ( dots ) through the light cones are , and what the velocities are at these points . ]",
    "we note that our approach has little if any overlap with the proposals of huw price @xcite , who argues that backwards causation can `` solve the puzzles of quantum mechanics . ''",
    "whereas price seeks to exploit backwards causation to _ avoid _ nonlocality , we use it to _ achieve _ nonlocality in a lorentz invariant way . moreover , while our model involves advanced effects on particle trajectories , we do not propose any advanced effects on the wave function , as does price @xcite .",
    "we have reason to believe that in our model , ( macro ) causes precede ( macro ) effects .",
    "to be sure , why causality proceeds in one direction alone is not easy to understand , even without a micro arrow .",
    "the usual understanding grounds this in low entropy `` initial '' conditions , and the same considerations should apply even when there is a micro arrow , even when this arrow points ( in a reasonable sense ) in the opposite direction .",
    "consequently , macrocausality , which is what usual causal reasoning involves , should follow the thermodynamic arrow of time .",
    "affects the wave function only in the absolute future@xmath82 of @xmath85 . but",
    "this means that @xmath86 is changed , so that the velocity at @xmath87 is likely to be affected . ]    to see how this interplay between micro- and macro - causality plays out in our model , consider two electromagnetic potentials @xmath19 and @xmath88 that differ only in a small space - time region @xmath85 around the point @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . solving the multi - time dirac equation for the same initial@xmath82",
    "wave function gives two functions @xmath89 which differ only for those @xmath0-tuples @xmath40 of space - time points for which at least one @xmath35 lies inside or on the @xmath11 light cone of some @xmath90 .",
    "we can regard effects on the wave function as always after@xmath82 the external cause . not so for the world lines",
    "; in general , effects of @xmath91 will be found everywhere : in the future , past and present of @xmath2 .",
    "more precisely , given a solution @xmath92 ( an @xmath0-tuple of paths ) of the law of motion for @xmath32 , there will be no corresponding solution @xmath93 of the law of motion for @xmath79 such that @xmath92 and @xmath93 agree in the past of @xmath85 , or in the future of @xmath85 .",
    "so on the particle level , causation is effectively in both time directions .",
    "note that this can not possibly lead to causal paradoxes since there is no room for paradoxes in the dirac equation and our law of motion .",
    "this is essentially because there is no feedback mechanism which could lead to causal loops .",
    "instead , the dirac equation may be solved in the ordinary way from past to future , starting out from an initial@xmath82 wave function , and the equation of motion can subsequently be solved from initial@xmath7 conditions .",
    "thus , insofar as the microscopic dynamics is concerned , there is no way a paradox could possibly arise .",
    "this proves consistency even for a universe governed as a whole by our law of motion . in this respect ,",
    "the situation is much different with wheeler ",
    "feynman electrodynamics , tachyons , and theories involving closed timelike curves , since they all have microcausal feedback , so that even the existence of solutions is dubious for given initial data .",
    "one last remark concerning the question , touched upon earlier , of whether macroscopic backwards causation is possible in our model ( i.e. , whether observable events in the future can cause observable effects in the past ) : the nonlocal backwards microcausal mechanism in our model is based on quantum entanglement , which is now widely regarded as giving rise to a rather fragile sort of nonlocality , revealed through violations of bell s inequality , that does not support the sort of causal relationship between observable events that can be used for signalling .",
    "( for our model , however , things are trickier than usual since no - signalling results are grounded on the @xmath1 distribution . )    in the nonrelativistic limit @xmath94 , the unusual causal mechanism of our model is replaced by a more conventional one : as mentioned earlier , the future light cone ( and the past light cone , as well ) approaches the @xmath83 hypersurface , so instead of having to find the points where the other world lines cross the future light cone , one needs to know the points where the other world lines cross the @xmath83 hypersurface ( which in the nonrelativistic limit does not depend on the choice of reference frame ) .",
    "this means that the configuration of the particle system at time @xmath84 determines directly all the velocities and thus the evolution of the configuration into the future ( or the past , as well ) .",
    "thus the nonrelativistic limit of our model is causally routine , and our model can be regarded as illustrating how a simple small deviation from this normal picture , imperceptible in the nonrelativistic domain , can provide a relativistic account of nonlocality .",
    "in fact , it is easy to see that in the nonrelativistic limit of small velocities and slow changes in the wave function , our model coincides with the usual bohm  dirac model @xcite , so that it is then compatible with a @xmath1 distribution of positions and thus with the bell  eprb correlations .",
    "times the relevant distance , so that the results of bell correlation experiments that probe superluminal nonlocality are not accounted for by our model . ]",
    "we have proposed that in our relativistic universe quantum nonlocality originates in a microcausal arrow of time opposite to the thermodynamic one .",
    "we recognize that this proposal is rather speculative .",
    "however , we believe it is a possibility worth considering .",
