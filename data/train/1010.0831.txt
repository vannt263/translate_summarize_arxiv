    "2001 ) , pointed out that at present time the expansion of the universe is accelerating .",
    "this could be explained either by considering that gravity at some large scales can not be described by the standard general relativity and/or that the universe is filled with some sort of negative - pressure `` dark energy '' that drives the accelerated expansion ( peebles et al .",
    "2003 , padmanabhan 2003 , copeland et al .",
    "2006 , frieman et al .",
    "2008 , linder 2008 , caldwell et al .",
    "2009 ) ; either way , it requires new physics beyond general relativity and the standard model of particle physics .",
    "the simplest possibility is to extend einstein s equation with a cosmological constant , or equivalently , to hypothesize a fluid with an equation - of - state parameter @xmath5 ( with @xmath6 and @xmath7 the pressure and energy density , respectively ) .",
    "however , it may well be that the cosmological `` constant '' actually evolves with time , in which case @xmath8 , and there are a variety of possibilities to believe that this might be the case ( ratra et al .",
    "1988 , caldwell et al .",
    "precise measurement of @xmath9 ( with , in general , a parameterized redshift dependence ) or , relatedly , the cosmic expansion history @xmath3 , has thus become a central goal of physical cosmology ( peacock et al .",
    "2006 , albrecht et al .",
    "2006 ) .    at present , the most promising techniques to determine the cosmic expansion history are supernova searches ( riess et al .",

    "all these techniques have different strengths and suffer from different systematics and weaknesses . as argued in the eso / esa and dark energy task force reports ( peacock et al .",
    "2006 , albrecht et al .",
    "2006 ) , robust conclusions about the cosmic expansion history will likely require several independent methods to allow for cross checks and control of systematics .",
    "as suggested by jimenez & loeb ( 2002 ) , an interesting and complementary approach to this problem is the study of the change in the age of the universe as a function of redshift .",
    "the strength of this method is that it avoids the common weakness of the other techniques , i.e. the reliance on integrated quantities to determine the expansion history .",
    "however , to fully exploit this approach , it is required to find a population of standard clocks able to trace the evolution of the relative age of the universe .",
    "+ many recent works gave growing observational evidence that the most massive galaxies contain the oldest stellar populations up to redshifts of @xmath10 ( dunlop et al .",

    "2006 , pozzetti et al .",
    "this population of massive , red , passive early - type galaxies ( _ etgs _ ) consists of the oldest objects in the universe at each redshift .",
    "the differential ages of these galaxies should thus be a good indicator for the rate of change of the age of the universe as a function of redshift up to @xmath14 , given that it is commonly accepted that the bulk of their stars was formed at @xmath15 .",
    "there are some works that try to constrain the cosmic expansion history using this approach ( ferreras et al .",
    "2001 , jimenez et al .",
    "2003 , krauss et al .",

    "stern et al .",
    "2010 , crawford et al .",
    "2010 ) . however , a problem of this technique is that it relies on the determination of a non - observable parameter using spectra and/or spectral energy distributions , i.e. the age of the stellar population , which presents strong and well known degeneracies with other parameters that are evaluated simultaneously , such as the metallicity , the star formation history , the dust content .",
    "the aim of this project is to search for features in the spectra of etgs that minimize the impact of systematics on the estimate of the relative ages of galaxies , which is the relevant quantity to determine @xmath3 using the cosmic chronometer method . as we will demonstrate below",
    ", the 4000  break is a feature correlated almost linearly with age at fixed metallicity .",
    "the 4000  break ( d4000 ) is a spectral feature produced by the blending of a large number of absorption lines in a narrow wavelength region , that creates a break in the continuum spectrum at 4000  restframe .",
    "the main contribution to the opacity comes from ionized metals . in hot stars , the metals",
    "are multiply ionized and the opacity decreases , so the d4000 will be small for young stellar population and large for old , metal rich galaxies .",
    "a measure break amplitude was firstly introduced as the ratio of the average of the flux densities below and above 4000  ( hamilton , 1985 ) ; he was also the first to suggest that this feature can be used as an age indicator for a galaxy . since then , different index definition were proposed , depending on the width of the red and blue regions where the fluxes are evaluated , and many studies have been done on this feature .",
    "balogh et al . ( 1999 ) introduced a definition of d4000 with narrower bands , supporting this choice with a lower sensitivity to reddening effects .",
    "bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) created a model for computing the spectral evolution of stellar populations ( bc03 ) , capable also to trace the dependence of d4000 on age and metallicity as a function of age , reddening and star formation history .",
    "kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found , from sdss observations , that the distribution of d4000 is strongly bimodal , showing a clear division between galaxies dominated by old stellar population and galaxies with more recent star formation .    in this paper",
    "we analyze almost 14 000 etgs extracted from the sdss survey , in the redshift range @xmath16 .",
    "we will show that for these old , red and passive objects the d4000 is , if the metallicity is known , an optimal indicator that correlates almost linearly with age , depending only marginally on the adopted synthetic stellar population models or star formation history ( sfh ) .",
    "it is therefore possible to use the differential d4000 evolution of the galaxies as a tracer for their differential age evolution , and thus to set constraints to cosmological parameters in an almost model - independent way .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in sect .",
    "[ sec : sample ] , we present the data sample , describe the different criteria with which etgs have been selected , and give information about the d4000 definition adopted ; we also discuss the mass and metallicity evaluation , and give more details about the distribution of various parameters that enhance the robustness of our selection . in sect .",
    "[ sec : model0 ] , we describe the analysis done on the d4000-age relation obtained both using bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) and maraston & str@xmath17mb@xmath18ck ( 2010 ) stellar population synthesis models , showing that in the range of d4000 probed by our data the linear approximation works extremely well and evaluating the slope of this relation as a function of metallicity .",
    "we therefore obtain the theoretical relation linking the d4000 with the redshift as a function of the various cosmological parameters . in sect .",
    "[ sec : d4000z ] we show the d4000-z relations obtained for different mass subsamples of our data , obtaining a clear redshift evolution for all the sample and a strong evidence of mass - downsizing . in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] we show the results of the evaluation of @xmath19 and of a constant @xmath20 , comparing them with the recent determination done by riess et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , by the wmap 7-years analysis and by amanullah et al .",
    "we also discuss the robustness of our results against possible systematics from which our analysis may suffer , such as the dependence on the estimate of the absolute age of a galaxy from the @xmath21 , on the star formation histories considered , on the stellar population synthesis models assumed , on the metallicity evaluation and on the not perfect assumption of the passive evolution of our etgs , reporting at the end our estimates of @xmath19 and @xmath20 both quoting statistical and systematic errors .",
    "the sample of galaxies analyzed in this paper has been selected from the spectroscopic catalog of the sixth data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss - dr6 ) .",
    "this survey provides _ u , g , r , i , z _ photometry and spectra for almost 800 000 galaxies over @xmath22 square degrees .",
    "galaxies have been extracted to have a petrosian magnitude @xmath23 .",
    "the spectra are taken using 3-arcsec diameter fibres , positioned as close as possible to the centers of the target galaxies .",
    "the flux ( and wavelenght ) calibrated spectra cover the range 3800 - 9200  , with a resolution of @xmath24 . to obtain a wider wavelength coverage for the photometry",
    ", we use a match between sdss - dr6 galaxies and 2mass survey provided to us by jarle brinchmann ( private communication ) , with which we extend the sdss photometry with the j , h and k bands . in this way we obtain for each galaxy a 8-bands spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from u to k , very important for a more robust determination of mass and of colors of the galaxy . +",
    "as explained before , it is fundamental to have a population of standard clocks in order to do precision cosmology with the differential age technique . in a previous paper ( moresco et al .",
    "2010 ) , we checked on the zcosmos 10k bright sample that a simple color selection is not restrictive enough to exclude starforming galaxies from the early - type galaxies selection . following",
    "the analysis explained in that paper , we therefore decided to apply a more restrictive selection , on the basis of photometric and spectroscopic informations , to obtain a uniform , passive population of early - type galaxies ( etgs ) ; we selected from sdss - dr6 all galaxies matching these criteria :    * no strong emission lines : we decided to select only galaxies with @xmath25\\lambda3727)<5 $ ]  and @xmath26  .",
    "these two spectroscopic features are strongly correlated with ongoing or recent episodes of star formation history .",
    "this upper limit in the equivalent width allows us to select galaxies that have experienced a limited ( or null ) amount of star formation in the last 1 - 2 gyrs , thus choosing the most passive sample . *",
    "early - type sed : following the procedure explained in zucca et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we performed a best - fit modeling of the multi - band photometry of these galaxies using the empirical set of 62 seds described in ilbert et al .",

    "we decided to use the d4000 definition proposed by balogh et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , that uses narrower bands in order to be less sensitive to reddening effects ( 3850 - 3950  and 4000 - 4100  ) ; we denote this index as @xmath21 : @xmath27 in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] we plot the average stacked spectrum of 10 random galaxies , selected to be in the highest tail of the @xmath21 distribution ( @xmath28 ) and for which the @xmath21 has been measured with high accuracy ( @xmath29 ) .",

    "( 2006 ) , the spectrophotometric calibration of the sdss spectra is less reliable around @xmath31  , due to the throughput of the spectrometer .",
    "this means that the value of the @xmath32 can be affected by this problem for galaxies in the lowest redshift range ( bernardi , private communication ) . in order to avoid this potential source of uncertainty",
    ", we decided to select our final sample at @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , since the number of galaxies decreases very rapidly at @xmath34 , we excluded galaxies beyond z=0.3 .",
    "thus , the final redshift range of our sample is @xmath16 . + as explained in the forthcoming section , the metallicity estimate for these galaxies has been taken from the sdss - dr4 analysis performed by gallazzi et al .",

    "( 2005 ) , in which they derived stellar metallicities for a sample of sdss - dr2 , afterward extended to sdss - dr4 ( _ www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/sdss/dr4/data/stellarmet.html_ ) .",

    "<S> we present a new methodology to determine the expansion history of the universe analyzing the spectral properties of early - type galaxies ( etg ) , based on the study of the redshift dependence of the 4000  break . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we describe the method , explore its robustness using theoretical synthetic stellar population models , and apply it using a sdss sample of @xmath014 000 etgs . </S>",
    "<S> our motivation to look for a new technique has been to minimize the dependence of the cosmic chronometer method on systematic errors . in particular , as a test of our method , we derive the value of the hubble constant ( 68% confidence ) , which is not only fully compatible with the value derived from the hubble key project , but also with a comparable error budget . using the sdss </S>",
    "<S> , we also derive , assuming @xmath1 , a value for the dark energy equation of state parameter . </S>",
    "<S> given the fact that the sdss etg sample only reaches @xmath2 , this result shows the potential of the method . </S>",
    "<S> in future papers we will present results using the high - redshift universe , to yield a determination of @xmath3 up to @xmath4 . </S>"
