    "newton s law of gravitation and coulomb s law for electrical charges , one of the very first laws of theoretical physics , assumed instantaneous action - at - a - distance between particles .",
    "the gravitational and electrical effects due to masses and charges respectively , were assumed to travel at infinite speed in these laws .",
    "the experiments in electrodynamics , however , demonstrated that coulomb s law was inadequate to explain their results .",
    "gauss suggested action - at - a - distance propagating at a finite speed ( speed of light ) in his letter to weber in 1845 @xcite .",
    "however , this did not get immediately formulated . instead , maxwell developed classical field theory of electrodynamics which has effects propagating at the speed of light .",
    "this was also found to be consistent with special relativity ( which discarded instantaneous action - at - a - distance of newton s and coulomb s laws ) .",
    "maxwell field theory can be described by the following relativistically invariant action , @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the field , with infinite degrees of freedom , defined in terms of the 4-potential @xmath4 as @xmath5 .",
    "the particles ( labelled by @xmath6 ) do not interact directly with each other but interact through their coupling with the field ( described by the third term in @xmath7 ) .    in early 20th century , schwarzschild @xcite , tetrode @xcite and fokker @xcite developed a relativistically invariant action - at - a - distance theory .",
    "this partially found the answer to gauss s problem .",
    "this theory can be described by the fokker action which is given as follows .",
    "@xmath8    the first term is the same inertial term as in the field theoretic action .",
    "the second term represents electromagnetic interactions between two different particles @xmath9 connected by a light cone being zero .",
    "@xmath10 , @xmath11 are typical points on worldlines of the two particles @xmath12 , @xmath13 . ] , thus preserving relativistic invariance .",
    "this action with the following definitions of direct particle potentials @xmath14 and fields @xmath15 , @xmath16    gives exactly maxwell - like equations for @xmath17 and lorentz - like equations of motion for the particles @xcite .",
    "this formulation hence resembles and seems to provide an alternative to the maxwell s field theory .",
    "action - at - a - distance in electrodynamics was provided a paradigm by wheeler and feynman in 1945 @xcite through their absorber theory of radiation .",
    "this theory , formulated in static and flat universe , uses advanced absorber response from the entire universe as the origin for radiation reaction but , being time - symmetric in nature , allows for both retarded and advanced net interactions as consistent solutions .",
    "wheeler and feynman broke this symmetry in favour of the former by making an appeal to statistical mechanics .",
    "extension of this formulation to expanding cosmological models ( using conformal invariance of electromagnetism and conformal flatness of cosmological models ) was done by hogarth @xcite and more generally by hoyle - narlikar @xcite .",
    "self - consistency of net advanced and retarded interactions in these models can be investigated by evaluating wheeler - feynman absorption integrals .",
    "only those models can be considered to be viable which have only net retarded interactions ( as observed in nature ) .",
    "it was found by hoyle - narlikar that steady - state model satisfies this criterion while friedman models do not @xcite .",
    "action - at - a - distance electrodynamics has to be first formulated for a generalized riemannian space - time , before appyling it to cosmological space - times using conformal symmetry .",
    "this has been formulated by hoyle - narlikar @xcite by generalizing fokker action to curved space - times using green s functions for wave equation .",
    "here we evaluate wheeler - feynman ( wf ) absorption integrals in quasi - steady - state cosmology ( qssc ) to investigate the self - consistency for net retarded and advanced electromagnetic interactions .",
    "qssc , based on the steady - state cosmology , is an alternative model to the standard cosmology .",
    "it was proposed by hoyle , burbidge and narlikar in 1993 @xcite .",
    "this is cosmological solution for machian theory of gravity proposed by hoyle and narlikar in 1964 @xcite with periodic creation of matter .",
    "the line element of qssc can be represented as ,    @xmath18\\\\   & = & \\omega^{2}(t)\\left[dt^{2}-dr^{2}-r^{2}\\left(d\\theta^{2}+\\sin^{2}\\theta d\\phi^{2}\\right)\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the scale factor ] of qssc has the following form which is expanding exponentially over a large time scale @xmath19 and oscillating over a much shorter time scale @xmath20 .",

    "it is important to note that the oscillatory microstructure in the scale factor @xmath33 is not being ignored or approximated here .",
    "we are instead considering bounds on the functional forms , in an appropriate way .",
    "hence the results obtained in the next section ( regarding wf absorption integrals ) are exact and not approximate .",
    "in this section we evaluate wf absorption integrals ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) in qssc , to check self - consistency of retarded ( @xmath43 ) and advanced ( @xmath10 ) solutions .",
    "we are using hoyle - narlikar approach @xcite for this evaluation , with radiation reaction provided by absorber response from the entire universe .",
    "the conditions required for this are given by the divergences of the following integrals .",

    "thus qssc satisfies the condition for @xmath41 ( see ( [ eq : wf absorption integrals ] ) ) and admits self - consistent retarded solution .    similarly using ( [ eq : inequality on advanced wave frequency ] ) for advanced solution ,    @xmath66\\leq-\\frac{n_{max}}{\\omega_{0}^{3}}p^{3}\\left(\\frac{1+\\eta}{1-\\eta}\\right)^{3}\\frac{1}{\\left(t_{0}-r\\right)^{3}}\\ ] ]    @xmath67    the past absorption integral @xmath68 satisfies and @xmath69 are positive , finite constants .",

    "it is important to note that the absorption property derived here ( for both future and past absorption ) is a robust result .",
    "it is independent of where the observer is located .",
    "( this is also evident from the fact that nowhere in the calculation the value @xmath35 , or local qualitative behaviour related to its position , is required ) .",
    "hence the same result applies to observers located at epochs corresponding to deep crest or trough of the oscillation .",
    "this is because the underlying theory being global ( and not local ) in nature , one has to consider absorber response from the entire universe .",
    "this amounts to evaluating wf absorption integrals @xmath41 and @xmath42 till future and past infinities , respectively .",
    "thus local variations or position of the observer do not affect the results in any significant way .",
    "in order to support the note made in the last paragraph of previous section , we present an additional analysis in this section to demonstrate that the self - consistency conditions in qssc are independent of @xmath74 or local position of the observer ( i.e. in crest or trough of the oscillation ) .",

    "thus since both @xmath41 and @xmath42 diverge in this case , both future and past absorbers are perfect .",
    "this model of purely oscillatory universe thus has ambiguous outcome for causality and an external criterion ( e.g. statistical mechanics , as used in @xcite for flat space - time ) would be required to decide the direction of time .    in the pure expansion case ( @xmath92 limit ) ,",
    "i.e. with the oscillatory term absent in @xmath33 , @xmath93    in qssc model , however , the time scales @xmath34 and @xmath32 assume positive , finite and non - zero values .",
    "hence the value of @xmath94 is large ] but finite . for any finite non - zero value of @xmath94 , @xmath95 and hence @xmath42 converge to finite values .",
    "hence qssc satisfies self - consistency condition for retarded but not advanced solution .",
    "it can also be noted that all the above results are unchanged for any value of @xmath96 , i.e. position of the observer in oscillation cycle .",
    "hence the self - consistency conditions are the same for observers located in crests or troughs of the oscillation .",
    "the above calculations show that in qssc , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "this thus concludes , in a self consistent way , that qssc assumes only net full retarded electromagnetic interactions .",
    "this causality is applicable at all time epochs , as illustrated in the previous section .",
    "qssc is thus a viable cosmological model according to action - at - a - distance formulation .",
    "though this can not be the sufficient criterion to decide for the correct cosmological model , it certainly is a necessary criterion , according to this approach .    also , this has interesting implications on the origin of arrow of time .",
    "the choice of the direction of time is _ ad hoc _ in field theory i.e. the retarded solution is chosen arbitrarily over the advanced one .",
    "however in action - at - a - distance formulation , origin of time asymmetry can be attributed to the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "the universe has such a cosmological stucture that it provides the correct absorber response to produce net retarded interactions , thus fixing the arrow of time .",
    "quasi - steady - state model is a suitable candidate for such a cosmological structure , as shown in the present work .",
