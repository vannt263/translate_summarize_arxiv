    "anisotropic flow  @xcite , described by the coefficients in the fourier expansion of the azimuthal particle distributions with respect to the symmetry planes , is an important observable to study the properties of the hot and dense matter , the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , created in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
