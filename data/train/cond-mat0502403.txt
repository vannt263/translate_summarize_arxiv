    "the ising model with arbitrary interactions is perhaps the most successful one in statistical physics . despite its ( relative ) simplicity ,",
    "it has been used to model such a variety of complex systems exhibiting cooperative phenomena that it can be regarded with fairness as a paradigm of a model system . besides its multiple applications in theoretical physics ( in fact",
    ", onsager s solution of the two - dimensional model was the cornerstone of the modern theory of critical phenomena ) one of its most conspicuous application in condensed matter ( and its original motivation ) is related to the description of anisotropic magnetic materials . while mostly applied in the past decades to bulk magnetic materials , the advances in film growth techniques , such as atomic or molecular epitaxy , has raised a renewed interest in the behavior of the two - dimensional version of the model .",
    "in particular , the study of thin magnetic films and quasi two  dimensional magnetic materials ( like the rare earth layers that occur in perovskite structures of re@xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 , re being a rare earth of the lanthanide series @xcite ) has experimented an increasing interest during the last years .",
    "part of this interest is obviously motivated by the great amount of applications they find nowadays in many different technological fields , such as data storage , catalysis and electronic uses are only a few examples , among many others . nevertheless , they have also caught the attention of both theoretical and experimental physicists due to the rich insight they provide into the fundamental role that microscopic interactions play in determining the macroscopic properties of a material .",
    "one of the most interesting applications of the two - dimensional ising model is related to the theoretical description of ultra - thin magnetic films , like metal films on metal substrates ( e.g. fe on cu @xcite , co on au @xcite , see also @xcite for a recent review on the topic ) .",
    "if the magnetic film is thin enough ( less than approximately five monolayers ) the atomic magnetic moments tend to align out of the plane defined by the proper film .",
    "this occurs because the surface anisotropy overcomes the anisotropy of the dipolar interactions , which favor in  plane ordering . under these circumstances",
    ", one can then model the local magnetic momenta of the material by using ising variables .",
    "any realistic theoretical description of a magnetic thin film must include , besides the usual short  range exchange interactions , also the long  range antiferromagnetic dipolar interactions .",
    "it is worth mentioning that dipolar interactions have been usually neglected , specially in thermodynamical studies , due to the small magnitude of dipolar interactions relative to the magnitude of the exchange interactions .",
    "nevertheless , it is a well established fact that dipolar interactions can give place to very rich phenomenological scenarios , concerning both thermodynamical and nonequilibrium properties . in particular , when both interactions are present , the system is inherently frustrated , and many of the interesting static and dynamical properties of systems with dipolar interactions result , precisely , from this property .    in this paper",
    "we will review the recent advances in the study of equilibrium ( _ i.e. , thermodynamical _ ) and out of equilibrium properties of the ising model with competition between short  range ferromagnetic exchange interactions and long  range antiferromagnetic dipolar interactions defined on a square lattice and ruled by the following dimensionless hamiltonian : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 stands for the quotient between the exchange @xmath6 and the dipolar @xmath7 interactions parameters , i.e. , @xmath8 .",
    "the first sum runs over all pairs of nearest neighbor spins and the second one over all distinct pairs of spins of the lattice .",
    "@xmath9 is the distance , measured in crystal units , between sites @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the energy is measured in units of @xmath7 , which is assumed to be always positive ( antiferromagnetic ) ; hence @xmath12 means ferromagnetic exchange couplings .",
    "the basic features of the finite temperature phase diagram associated with hamiltonian ( [ hamilton1 ] ) were first derived by macisaac and coauthors in 1995 @xcite . in that work the existence of equilibrium striped states was firmly established for the first time .",
    "they showed that the ground state of hamiltonian ( [ hamilton1 ] ) is indeed the striped one , provided that the relative strength of the interactions @xmath5 exceeds some positive value @xmath13 @xcite . if @xmath14 the ground state is the antiferromagnetic one .",
    "if @xmath15 the ground state is composed by antialigned stripes of width @xmath16 , which depends on @xmath5 .",
    "macisaac and coworkers showed that for every finite value of @xmath15 there exists always a value of @xmath16 such that the corresponding striped state has less energy than both the ferromagnetic and the checkerboard states , which had been previously proposed as the ground state for this system @xcite .",
    "moreover , they showed that this is true for _ any _ value of @xmath5 .",
    "in other words , the presence of the dipolar interactions , even with an infinitesimal strength , suppress the ferromagnetic ordering , favoring the formation of stripe domains .",
    "the also showed that for large values of @xmath5 the equilibrium width increases exponentially @xmath17 .",
    "although not rigorously demonstrated up to now , a very large amount of numerical evidence supports the results of macisaac and coauthors .",
    "most of the knowledge about the finite temperature equilibrium properties of the model has been obtained by means of monte carlo numerical simulations on finite lattices .",
    "these have been performed on square lattices of @xmath18 sites @xcite using metropolis or heat bath algorithms .",
    "monte carlo simulations has been vastly used to study finite temperature properties of magnetic lattice spin models . however , performing monte carlo simulations in system ( [ hamilton1 ] ) involves some particular subtleties to take into account , due to the presence of dipolar interactions .",
    "first of all , the modulated nature of the ground state implies that the linear size @xmath19 of the system must be chosen commensurate with the period of the modulation associated with the particular value of @xmath5 under consideration ; otherwise , an artificial frustration is introduced .",
    "a second point concernes the structure of the ground state as the value of @xmath5 is increased . for relatively large values of @xmath5 , striped states of widths similar to that of the ground state",
    "have very low energies",
    ". this may generate ( as we will see later ) multiple metastable states at low temperature , making it very difficult to equilibrate and therefore to determine the truly thermodynamically stable state .",
    "other complications arise as direct consequences of the long - range character of the dipolar interactions .",
    "since every spin in the lattice interacts with each other , flipping a spin does not affect only a few neighbor spins , but _ all _ the rest of the spins in the lattice .",
    "this means that most of the powerful algorithms developed in the last years to improve the efficiency of monte carlo simulations ( like block algorithms ) do not apply , since most of them rely on the finite range of the interactions .",
    "to further complicate the situation , the antiferromagnetic nature of the dipolar term does not allow the application of some specially designed algorithm for systems with long - range ferromagnetic interaction @xcite .",
    "this means that , except from some recent works on the triangular lattice@xcite , most of the simulations of this model are based on simple metropolis or heat bath algorithms , in which the typical number of operations to perform a monte carlo step goes as @xmath20 rather than @xmath21 , as in systems with short range interactions .",
    "other consequences of the long - range character of the dipolar interactions are the strong finite - size effects , since in this case every spin feels _ directly _ the influence of the border . as in any type of system ,",
    "the best way to diminish border effects is to use periodic boundary conditions .",
    "while both the interpretation and implementation of periodic boundary conditions are straightforward in systems with short range microscopic interactions , their usage in systems with long - range interactions is more subtle . in a general situation , there are two alternative representations of a finite two - dimensional system with periodic boundary conditions",
    ". on one hand , we can visualize the system as a torus , where a given spin interacts with its closer neighbors defined by the topology of the torus , up to a certain range of interaction , that is , to consider a finite translationally invariant system .",
    "on the other hand , we can think that we have an infinite system , where the original finite system has been replicated infinite times in all the coordinate directions .",
    "in other words , we can think that the infinite lattice has been partitioned into cells of size @xmath22 and that we have chosen only the periodic solutions of the problem , with periodicity @xmath19 in all the coordinate directions . while the difference between both views is just a matter of interpretation for systems with short - range interactions , the situation changes for long - range interacting systems . according to the second scheme",
    ", a given spin will interact with _",
    "infinite replicas of everyone of the rest of the spins _ and we can express the effective interaction between two spins inside the system as an infinite sum over replicas ( this includes a `` self - interaction '' term , that accounts for the interaction of every spin with its own replicas ) . on the other hand , in the closed topology of the first scheme",
    "it is consistent to consider that every pair of spins inside the system interacts only through its _ minimal _ distance over the torus .",
    "this corresponds to the minimal truncation of the infinite series of the previous scheme and it is sometimes called the _ first image convention_. while the efficiency of both type of schemes can be very different in systems that presents low temperature ferromagnetic ordering , in the case of hamiltonian ( [ hamilton1 ] ) the differences are minimal @xcite , with a little improvement obtained with the first scheme .",
    "the usage of a particular scheme is then a matter of convenience .",
    "however , while the usage of the second scheme is straightforward , the implementation of the first is more involved , since the infinite series for the effective interactions are slowly convergent . the usual way of handling them numerically is to adapt the ewald sums technique @xcite , originally derived for systems of interacting charged particles @xcite .",
    "the finite temperature phase diagram in the @xmath23 space was first calculated using monte carlo simulations on small lattices ( @xmath24 ) by macisaac and coauthors in @xcite .",
    "further improvements at low temperature were obtained by gleiser and coauthors in @xcite .",
    "the numerical simulations showed that both the antiferromagnetic and the different striped states remain stable at finite temperatures below some @xmath5-dependent critical temperature @xmath25 . at @xmath26",
    "the specific heat    @xmath27    presents a peak , indicating that the system undergoes a phase transition into a disordered phase .",
    "both the nature of the disordered fase , as well as the order of the phase transition present several subtleties and will be considered in section [ hightemperature ] .",
    "we will consider now the properties of the system at temperatures well below the critical one .",
    "we will concentrate our attention in the low @xmath5 region of the phase diagram , that is , where the first striped states emerge after the antiferromagnetic one , when the value of @xmath5 crosses @xmath28 .",
    "the transition points between the different striped states at @xmath29 can be estimated by a numerical calculation of the striped states energies as a function of @xmath5 in finite size lattices of increasing linear sizes @xmath19 @xcite .",

    "the simulations start at @xmath29 from an ordered configuration . in fig.[stability1 ] we show an example for @xmath47 , corresponding to an h2 ground state . in this case",
    "two simulations were performed in parallel , one starting from the h1 and the other from the h2 ( vertical ) striped states , and in each case @xmath49 and @xmath48 were respectively measured , as well as the corresponding susceptibilities . in fig.[stability2 ] we show a simultaneous measurement of @xmath49 and @xmath48 in a simulation started from the h1 state . when starting from h2 the system remains in this state up to the critical temperature ( i.e. , that of the peak in the specific heat ) where @xmath48 suddenly drops to a small value , with an associated peak in the corresponding susceptibility .",
    "the same behavior is reversely obtained by slowly cooling the system from high temperatures .",
    "this shows that the h2 state is thermodynamically stable . on the other hand ,",
    "when starting the simulation from the h1 state it remains stable up to certain temperature below the critical one , where it destabilizes and the h2 pattern emerges ( see fig.[stability2 ] ) , showing the metastable nature of the h1 phase for this particular value of @xmath5 .",

    "the dynamics of the two - dimensional hamiltonian ( [ hamilton1 ] ) at low enough temperatures is characterized , as occurs with any magnetic system that presents long  range order , by the formation and growth of small regions of ordered spins called _ domains . _ but unlike other magnetic models without disorder in the hamiltonian , in this particular case the competition between the short range ferromagnetic interactions ( that induces the system to order ) and the dipolar antiferromagnetic interactions ( that frustrates it and tends to increases the degeneracy of the ground state ) gives place to an unusual slowing down of the dynamics . and",
    "this peculiar behavior somehow resembles that observed in systems with imposed disorder ( i.e. , with randomness in the hamiltonian ) , such as , for instance , edwards ",
    "anderson spin glasses and random field ising models .",
    "this is not a minor point , at least from a statistical mechanics point of view , mainly because there has been a considerable effort during the last years in trying to find a lattice model able to catch many of the dynamical and thermodynamical properties of structural glasses , which also present a notorious slowing down of the dynamics . and unlike spin glasses",
    ", it is nowadays vastly accepted in the community that an adequate model for structural glasses can not include disorder in the hamiltonian . on the contrary",
    ", all the complexity of their dynamical behavior should be explained only in terms of the competition between the short range repulsion and long range attraction character of a some _ lennard ",
    "jones_like molecular interactions .",
    "although a complete discussion about those attributes that can make a lattice system an acceptable model for structural glass is out of the scope of this article , we will revisit this point below , in order to show some recent evidence that permit us to suspect that hamiltonian ( [ hamilton1 ] ) could be considered a good candidate for modelling a bidimensional structural glass system .",
    "let us come back to the _ thin  film _ interpretation of model ( [ hamilton1 ] ) , which in fact is shared by almost all the authors who have contributed to its study during the last years .",
    "in 1996 , sampaio , albuquerque and de menezes performed a detailed study of the relaxation dynamics and hysteresis effects of the model @xcite .",
    "in particular , starting from a fully magnetized configuration , they numerically analyzed the way the magnetization relaxes when the magnetic field is suddenly switched off .",
    "inside the striped phases , where the equilibrium magnetization is obviously zero , they surprisingly found two different dynamical regimes , depending on the value of @xmath5 . for @xmath92",
    "the initially fully magnetized state quickly relaxes to equilibrium , following the expected exponential law characterized by a strong dependence on both @xmath5 and temperature @xmath45 . on the other hand , when @xmath93 the relaxation presents a power law behavior with an exponent that does not depend on @xmath5 .",
    "this last behavior , usually found in systems with imposed disorder , motivated new investigations about the nature of the dynamical behavior of the model .",
    "hence , in the next three subsections we will present and discuss those results that have been found during the last years concerning the out of equilibrium dynamics of hamiltonian ( [ hamilton1 ] ) .",
    "aging is one of the most striking features in the off - equilibrium dynamics of many complex systems .",
    "it refers to the presence of strong memory effects spanning time lengths that in some cases exceed any available observational time .",
    "unfortunately , the large body of experimental evidence accumulated on the aging phenomena has not yet lead to a substantial understanding of the microscopic principles that can give origin to this complex phenomenology .",
    "aging phenomena are so relevant mainly because some kind of _ universality _ appears in its description which makes it possible to categorize different systems as members of different classes .",
    "the main feature of aging is the conjunction of extremely slow dynamics together with non stationary relaxation functions .",
    "in fact , a system that ages looses the time translation invariance .",
    "that means that all statistical quantities that depend on two times , do not depend only on their difference , as occurs in an equilibrated state .",
    "although aging has been seen in a wide variety of contexts and systems @xcite ( some of them , actually very simple ones @xcite ) it is perhaps in the realm of magnetic and structural glasses dynamics where a systematic study of these phenomena has been carried out ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    in real materials , aging can be observed , for instance , in a thermo ",
    "remanent magnetization ( trm ) relaxation experiment : the system is abruptly cooled under a magnetic field @xmath94 that is switched on at @xmath95 , when the system is quenched at @xmath96 , up to a time @xmath97 when it is suddenly turned off .",
    "one then verifies that the magnetization @xmath98 at time @xmath99 depends both on @xmath100 and @xmath97 , with @xmath101 .",
    "one can also measure aging by looking at the two  time autocorrelation function @xmath102 .",
    "although it is hard to measure autocorrelation functions in a real experiment , it is very simple to calculate it in a numerical experiment . for an ising system like the one considered in this article ,",

    "but , if the system does not equilibrate in a reasonable time , then @xmath106 will explicitly depend both on @xmath100 and @xmath97 , indicating the presence of aging .",
    "there are basically two scenarios within which aging can emerge . on one hand",
    ", aging appears as a consequence of weak ergodicity breaking @xcite and it is related to the complex structure of the region of phase space that the system explores in time .",
    "this is the case , for instance , in the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) @xcite model and other spin glass models in which the complexity of the energy function is associated to a certain degree of randomness and/or frustration in the hamiltonian . on the other hand ,",
    "the onset of aging in many systems derives from the presence of coarsening processes that give place to a drastic slowing down of the dynamics . in this case",
    "the scaling law of the two - time autocorrelation function is ruled by the following expression @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the mean linear size of the domains at time @xmath109 @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ aging - fig1 ] we see a typical behavior of @xmath110 inside the striped phase for @xmath111 , @xmath112 and different values of @xmath97 .",
    "clearly we verify the presence of aging , identified by the strong dependence on both @xmath109 and @xmath97 . for a given @xmath97",
    "we observe that the system stays in a quasi ",
    "equilibrium state before @xmath113 finally relaxes to zero .",
    "furthermore , as the time the system spends in the ordered phase @xmath97 increases , the time the system spends in the quasi  equilibrium state also increases ( this phenomenon is the origin of the name _ aging _ ) .",
    "an insight about the nature of the aging phenomena observed inside the striped phase can be obtained by analyzing the scaling properties of @xmath114 in different regions of the phase diagram , which can tell us about the universality class of the dynamical regime .",
    "indeed , there seems to be two different dynamical regimes @xcite , depending on the value of @xmath5 .",

    "if the slowing down of the dynamics is ruled by the domain growth process , as expected in this kind of model without disorder , after a certain time @xmath109 one can measure the average linear domain size @xmath108 .",
    "the time evolution of quantities like the autocorrelation function will then present a crossover from the dynamical regime characterized by length scales smaller than the domain size @xmath120 to a regime at larger scales , dominated by domain growth through the movement of domain walls . in this scenario , scaling arguments lead to the following ( and already mentioned ) dependency of @xmath121 @xmath122 hence , when @xmath123 @xmath124 is expected .",
    "summarizing , the results for @xmath125 are consistent with an algebraic growth of the linear domain size of the form @xmath126 .",
    "but what emerges as a much curious result is the behavior observed for @xmath127 , which appears to be consistent with a logarithmic time dependence of the average domain size @xmath128 predicted by an activated dynamic scenario proposed by fisher and huse @xcite in the context of spin glasses , in which both disorder and frustration generate active droplets excitations with a broad energy distribution .",
    "another consequence of the loose of the time invariant translation of a system that ages during its relaxation , is the violation of the fluctuation disipation theorem ( fdt ) .",
    "let us suppose that an inhomogeneous external magnetic field @xmath129 is switched on at time @xmath97 ; the conjugate response function at time @xmath130 can be defined as @xmath131    let us now assume that the system has attained true thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "then , time translational invariance holds and both the autocorrelation and the response functions depend only on the time difference @xmath109 and the fdt gives us a precise relationship between @xmath132 and @xmath133 :    @xmath134    for a system that ages , as the one studied in this paper , one can identify two different regimes , as we have already seen : for small values of @xmath109 ( @xmath135 ) the system is a quasi ",
    "equilibrium states , at least for large @xmath97 , and the all the equilibrium properties hold .",
    "but in the aging regime , when @xmath136 , both the time translation invariance and the fluctuation dissipation theorem do not hold . in other words ,",
    "@xmath110 and @xmath137 depend explicitly on @xmath109 and @xmath97 .",
    "in particular , for a great variety of disordered models and also during some coarsening processes , in this last regime a generalized version of the @xmath138 holds , which asserts that @xmath139 with @xmath140 .",
    "moreover , for large enough values of @xmath97 , @xmath141 becomes a function of time only though @xmath142 . the function @xmath143 can be now interpreted as a non  equilibrium _",
    "generalized temperature_. this kind of analysis has also been applied in @xcite to model ( [ hamilton1 ] ) .",
    "surprisingly , it was found that the system behaves in the same way , irrespectively of the value of @xmath5 .",
    "actually it was observed that , as @xmath144 , the generalized temperature tends to zero , which is a clear signature of a coarsening process .      as we have already seen , when a magnetic system is suddenly quenched from a very high temperature ( above the critical temperature @xmath89 ) into the ordered phase , small clusters of ordered spins form which are usually called _",
    "domains_. immediately after the cooling the system finds itself in a disordered state induced by the abrupt quench , but accordingly to the thermodynamical laws , it would evolve into an ordered state . under these circumstances",
    "the small domains of ordered states start growing , in a process that is usually called _",
    "coarsening_. if we could take a snapshot of the system a few seconds after the quench , we would identify a patchwork of small domains , ordered in so many different forms as different ground states the system admits .",
    "but , since there is a interfacial free energy cost associated with the surface of the boundary between domains , as the domains grow they compete with each other in order to impose their own order . as a consequence of this competition",
    ", the patchwork of domains evolves in time , trying to decrease the free  energy of the whole system by decreasing the area of the interface region between domains .",
    "coarsening is an ubiquitous phenomenon in nature that largely exceeds the realm of magnetism @xcite .",
    "even more , coarsening plays a fundamental role in many industrial processes , as for instance in molten iron .",
    "when the molten iron is suddenly quenched below the melting temperature , the originally dissolved fraction of carbon present in the system precipitates out .",
    "if the quench is fast enough , the carbon can not float to the top but stays dispersed through the iron forming small particles , and many of the relevant properties of cast iron depends specifically on the size and form of the carbon small clusters .",
    "hence , controlling the quality of the iron requires a precise knowledge of the coarsening process of carbon particles .",
    "other examples of coarsening in physical systems appear in foams , the ordering of binary alloy following a quench from above to below its order  disorder transition temperature and the phase separation of a binary fluid following the quenching from the one  phase to the two  phase region of its phase diagram .",
    "the simplest way to characterize the coarsening process is by measuring the time evolution of the _ characteristic domain linear size _ @xmath108 .",
    "this procedure , which is hard to carry out in an experiment , can be easily implemented in numerical simulations of ising models like the ones presented in this article .",
    "coarsening has been vastly studied during the last decades , both experimentally and theoretically , but there are still many open questions , especially concerning the role of frustration in the time evolution of @xmath108 .",
    "the domain growth scenario in the ferromagnetic phase of the ising model is very much alike the critical dynamics observed in the neighborhood of a critical point .",
    "the competition among the different domains trying to impose their order to the whole system ( as discussed above ) yields to a power law behavior of the average linear size @xmath108 @xmath145 note that this critical  like slowing down of the dynamics occurs even far away from the critical point .",
    "since the domain linear size @xmath108 will eventually reach macroscopic length scales one can expect that the coarsening exponent @xmath146 will be independent of many of the microscopic details .",
    "in other words , there should be only a few dynamical _ universality classes _ , as in fact occurs in the study of critical phenomena .",
    "two of these universality classes are already well understood .",
    "the first class corresponds to the case of a microscopic dynamics that preserve the order parameter of the system , and they are characterized by an exponent @xmath147 .",
    "they are usually called _ lifshitz  slyozov _ @xcite growth processes , and a typical realization is the spinodal decomposition .",
    "the second class is associated to those microscopic dynamics for which the order parameter is not conserved , and they are characterized by an exponent @xmath148 . as we indicated in [ simulaciones ] ,",
    "our simulations were all performed using a heat bath or metropolis monte carlo dynamics which correspond to this second universality class , usually called _ lifshitz  allen ",
    "cahn _ or _ curvature  driven _",
    "growth @xcite .",
    "a typical physical example is given by the process of grain growing in metals .",
    "but , there is also a third universality class observed in systems with imposed disorder , i.e. , in systems whose hamiltonian includes , besides the dynamical variables , a set of random variables necessary to describe the structural randomness of the system . in these cases",
    "the coarsening process departs from the usual power law of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and is characterized by a logarithmic growth rule of the form : @xmath149 spin glasses , random field models and models with random quenched impurities , are all examples of this third universality class . during many years it was not clear whether this behavior was restricted to systems with imposed disorder .",
    "nowadays it is believed that the departure from the power law dynamics is related to the existence of free energy barriers that the coarsening system has to overcome which grow linearly with @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "in fact , there are also a few examples of systems with logarithmic coarsening that do not present randomness in the hamiltonian , as for instance the three dimensional ising model with nearest  neighbors ferromagnetic interactions and next  nearest  neighbors antiferromagnetic interactions , whose dynamics has been described by shore , holzter and sethna in @xcite ( from now on we will refer to it as the shore model , even when it has already been analyzed by other authors@xcite ) . what seems to be the fundamental ingredient for the appearance of logarithmic coarsening is existence of a certain degree of frustration in the microscopic interactions .",
    "when coarsening is analyzed at zero temperature , it is relatively easy to determine numerically the domain growth law .",
    "but when the system is analyzed at a non zero temperature new challenges emerge .",
    "in particular , it is very hard to distinguish real domain structures from occasional small clusters generated by thermal fluctuations .",
    "one way to overcome this difficulty is to use a technique based on the spreading of damage method proposed by derrida @xcite and later on improved by hinrichsen and antoni @xcite .",
    "the method compares , as time goes on , the state of a suddenly quenched system with replicas of the same system initialized in the corresponding ground states .",
    "in particular , one needs to take into account the time evolution of so many replicas as possible ground states the system admits .",
    "remember that in our case , the system has , depending on the value of @xmath5 , @xmath150 possible ground states , which makes it very difficult to apply this technique for large values of @xmath5 .",
    "both the quenched system and all its replicas evolve under the same thermal noise or , in other words , using the same random sequence in the updating process . all those spin flips that occur simultaneously in the quenched replica and in one of the ground state systems are considered thermal fluctuations , and they are not taken into account in the calculus of the domain areas .",
    "we will summarize now the results of the coarsening dynamics of hamiltonian ( [ hamilton1 ] ) , which are presented in detail in @xcite .",
    "we focus our analysis in the particular case in which the system is quenched into the @xmath151 phase for values of @xmath152 ( see fig . [ phased ] ) . to characterize the domain growth ,",
    "the domain areas @xmath153 , defined as the number of spins inside each ordered cluster are first calculated .",
    "then , the characteristic linear domain size is calculated as @xmath154 .",
    "note that in this particular case , the spreading of damage method required a simultaneous comparison among five different replicas of the system ( one for the quenched replica plus four for each possible ground state ) .    in fig .",

    "on the other side , in @xcite the authors found a behavior proper of a simple coarsening process ( algebraic domain growth ) in the same region .",
    "we have shown how different types of dynamical analysis allows one to interpret these apparently contradictory results , showing that the differences observed can be actually ascribed to the existence , at low temperatures , of a metastability region where metastable stripe states of different width coexist .",
    "the analysis of the striped domains growth shows that these metastable states trap the dynamics of the system during certain transient that diverges as @xmath230 .",
    "when the system is quenched to the metastable region , small domains of the metastable phase pin the domain walls of the stable phase ; such metastable domains generate free energy barriers whose height is independent of the domain size @xmath19 , thus slowing the coarsening process for a finite ( temperature - dependent ) period of time .",
    "measurements taken with observation time scales smaller than this characteristic periods display an apparently logarithmic behavior .",
    "numerical experiments in which a slow cooling is performed from a thermalized state above the transition temperature give further support to this interpretation ( see fig.[cooling - fig4 ] ) .",
    "the existence of multiple metastable ordered states at higher values of @xmath5 and very low temperatures opens other interesting perspectives .",
    "we expect that the domain walls of the stable phases should be pinned by clusters of the different coexisting metastable phases .",
    "therefore , we expect a slow dynamics characterized by multiple characteristic time scales , associated with the different free energy barriers generated by each metastable phase .",
    "we see that many of the open questions remarked above appear for large values of @xmath5 .",
    "unfortunately , in this region finite size effects and the strong dynamical slowing down make numerical simulations prohibitive , since larger system sizes should be considered .",
    "the usage of more sophisticated non - metropolis sampling methods , like a recent adaptation of creutz cluster algorithm @xcite or the multicanonical algorithm @xcite , may help , at least for studying equilibrium properties .    finally , one important point of experimental importance @xcite that remains to be answered concerns the role of defects in the high temperature order - disorder transition .",
    "some advances along this line has been done recently in in the triangular lattice @xcite .",

    "we wish to thank h. toloza , d. stariolo and m. montemurro for their fruitful contributions .",
    "it is worth noting that the definition of the hamiltonian in @xcite is slightly different from ours .",
    "while in those papers the dipolar term contains a sum over all pairs of spins , here we consider the sum over every pair of spins just once .",
    "this leads to the equivalence @xmath231 , @xmath232 being the exchange parameter in the above references .",
    "since the dipolar parameter also fixes the energy units in our work , there is also a factor @xmath233 between the critical temperatures obtained in those works and ours .",
