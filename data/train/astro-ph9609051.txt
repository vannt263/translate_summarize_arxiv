    "the quest for @xmath0 , the current ratio of the mean mass density of the universe to the critical density required for closure , has been a focus of the research efforts of many astrophysicists involving a variety of different techniques . at present , most observational evidence suggests a universe with sub - critical matter density , perhaps with a cosmological constant making up the difference required for a critical universe ( e.g. , coles & ellis 1994 ; ostriker & steinhardt 1995 ) .",
    "the possibility of measuring @xmath0 using the amount of `` substructure '' in galaxy clusters has thus generated some interest , `` this is a critical area for further research , as it directly tests for @xmath15 in dense lumps , so both observational and theoretical studies on a careful quantitative level would be well rewarded . ''",
    "( ostriker 1993 ) .",
    "early analytical work ( e.g. , richstone , loeb , & turner 1992 ) and simulations ( evrard et al . 1993 ; mohr et al . 1995 ) found that the morphologies of x - ray clusters strongly favored @xmath16 over low - density universes .",
    "along with @xmath17 analysis of cosmic velocity fields ( e.g. , dekel 1994 ) , these substructure analyses were the only indicators in support of a critical value of @xmath0 . however , the analytical results ( e.g. , kauffmann & white 1993 ; nakamura , hattori , & mineshige 1995 ) , simulations ( e.g. , jing et al .",
    "1994 ) , and morphological statistics ( e.g. , buote & tsai 1995b ) have been criticized rendering the previous conclusions about @xmath0 uncertain .",
    "buote & tsai ( 1995b , hereafter bta ) introduced the power ratios ( prs ) for quantifying the spatial morphologies of clusters in terms of their dynamical states .",
    "the prs essentially measure the square of the ratio of a higher order moment of the two - dimensional gravitational potential to the monopole term computed within a circular aperture , where the radius is specified by a metric scale ( e.g. , 1 mpc ) .",
    "buote & tsai ( 1996 , hereafter btb ) computed prs of @xmath11 x - ray images for a sample of 59 clusters and discovered that the clusters are strongly correlated in pr space , obeying an `` evolutionary track '' which describes the dynamical evolution of the clusters ( in projection ) .",
    "tsai & buote ( 1996 , hereafter tb ) studied the prs of a small sample of clusters formed in the hydrodynamical simulation of navarro , frenk , & white ( 1995 ) and verified the interpretation of the `` evolutionary track '' .",
    "in contrast to the previous studies ( e.g. , richstone et al .",
    "1992 ; mohr et al .",
    "1995 ) , tb concluded that their small cluster sample , formed in a standard @xmath14 , cdm simulation , possessed too much substructure ( as quantified by the prs ) with respect to the @xmath11 clusters , and thus favored a lower value of @xmath0 .",
    "however , a statistically large sample of clusters is important for studies of cluster morphologies .",
    "the prs are most effective at categorizing clusters into different broad morphological types ; i.e. the distinction between equal - sized bimodals and single - component clusters is more easily quantified than are small deviations in ellipticities and core radii between single - component clusters ( see bta ) .",
    "the efficiency of the prs at classifying clusters into a broad range of morphological types is illustrated by their success at quantitatively discriminating the @xmath11 clusters along the lines of the morphological classes of jones & forman ( 1992 ) ( see btb ) .",
    "there is a lower frequency of nearly equal - sized bimodals in the @xmath11 sample than clusters with more regular morphologies .",
    "hence , to make most effective use of the prs the models need to be adequately sampled ( i.e. simulations have enough clusters ) to ensure that relatively rare regions of pr - space are sufficiently populated .    in this paper we build on the previous studies and investigate the ability of the prs to distinguish between models having different values of @xmath0 .",
    "unlike the previous theoretical studies of cluster morphologies mentioned above , we also consider models having different power spectra , @xmath1 , since @xmath1 should affect the structures of clusters as well . at the time we began this project it was too computationally costly to use hydrodynamical simulations to generate for several cosmological models a large , statistically robust , number of clusters with sufficient resolution . to satisfy the above criteria and computational feasibility we instead used pure n - body simulations .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "we discuss the selection of cosmological models in  [ models ] ; the specifications of the n - body simulations in  [ sample ] ; the validity of using dark - matter - only simulations to generate x - ray images and the construction of the images in  [ xray ] ; and computation of the prs in  [ prs ] .",
    "we analyze the models having different values of @xmath0 and a cosmological constant in ",
    "[ omega ] , and models with different spectral slopes and @xmath5 in  [ spectrum ] .",
    "the implications of the results for all of the models and comparison of the simulations to the @xmath11 sample of btb is discussed in ",
    "[ disc ] . finally , in  [ conc ] we present our conclusions .",
    "to test the sensitivity of cluster morphologies to the cosmological density parameter due to matter , @xmath0 , and the power spectrum of density fluctuations , @xmath1 , we examined several variants of the standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) model ( e.g. , ostriker 1993 ) . in table",
    "[ table.models ] we list the models and their relevant parameters : @xmath0 ; @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a cosmological constant and @xmath20 is the present value of the hubble parameter ; the spectral index , @xmath6 , of the scale - free power spectrum of density fluctuations , @xmath7 ; and @xmath5 , the present rms density fluctuations in spheres of radius @xmath21 mpc , where @xmath22 is defined by @xmath23 km s@xmath24 mpc@xmath24 .",
    "the parameters of the open cdm model ( ocdm ) and low - density , flat model ( lcdm ) were chosen to be consistent with current observations ( e.g. , ostriker & steinhardt 1995 ) . their normalizations were set according to the @xmath25 relationship of eke , cole , & frenk ( 1996 ) to agree with the observed abundance of x - ray clusters .",
    "the biased cdm model ( bcdm ) was also normalized in this way .",
    "however , the bcdm simulation , because it has @xmath14 , necessarily has poorer resolution ( i.e. fewer particles per cluster ) than the ocdm and lcdm models due to the fixed box size of our simulations ( see  [ xray ] ) . for the purposes of our investigation of cluster morphologies it is paramount to compare simulations having similar resolution .",
    "hence we use the scdm model ( with @xmath26 ) as our primary @xmath14 simulation for analysis , which has resolution equivalent to the ocdm and lcdm simulations .",
    "( we show in  [ svsb ] that the means of the pr distributions for bcdm and scdm are very similar which turns out to be most important for examining the effects of @xmath0 . ) hence , the scdm , ocdm , and lcdm models allow us to explore the effects of @xmath0 and @xmath27 on the cluster morphologies ; comparing scdm and bcdm provides information on the influence of @xmath5 .",
    "we explore the effects of different @xmath1 on the prs using the scale - free models , which have different @xmath6 from scdm .",
    "for the scale - free models we normalized each to the same characteristic mass , @xmath28 , defined to be ( cole & lacey 1996 ) the mass scale when the linear rms density fluctuation is equal to @xmath29 , the critical density for a uniform spherically symmetric perturbation to collapse to a singularity . for @xmath14 ,",
    "the linear theory predicts @xmath30 ( e.g. , padmanabhan 1993 ) .",
    "we take the scdm model with @xmath26 as a reference for these scale - free models which gives a characteristic mass of @xmath31 .",
    "this procedure allows a consistent means to normalize the scale - free models relative to each other on the mass scales of clusters .",
    "unfortunately , as a result of this normalization procedure , at earlier times the models have different large - scale power and thus the cluster mass functions are different for each of the models .",
    "the scale - free model with @xmath32 is similar to the scdm model and will be used to `` calibrate '' the scale - free models with respect to the other models ( see table [ table.models ] ) .",
    "we use the tree - particle - mesh ( tpm ) n - body code ( xu 1995b ) to simulate the dissipationless formation of structure in a universe filled with cold dark matter .",
    "the simulations consist of @xmath33 particles in a square box of width @xmath34 mpc .",
    "the gravitational softening length is @xmath35 kpc which translates to a nominal resolution of @xmath36 kpc .",
    "this resolution is sufficient for exploring the structure of clusters with prs in apertures of radii @xmath37 mpc ; for a discussion of the related effects of resolution on the performance of prs on @xmath11 x - ray images see buote & tsai ( 1995b ,  4 ) .",
    "all of the realizations have the same initial random phase .    for each simulation we located the 39 most massive clusters using a version of the denmax algorithm ( bertschinger & gelb 1991 ) modified by xu ( 1995a )",
    ". this convenient selection criterion yields well defined samples for each simulation and allows consistent statistical comparison between different simulations which is the principal goal of our present investigation . for the various cosmological models we explore ( see table [ table.models ] ) these clusters generally have masses ranging from @xmath38 , which correspond to typical cluster masses observed in x - ray ( e.g. , edge et al .",
    "1990 ; david et .",
    "al . 1993 ) and optically ( e.g. , carlberg et .",
    "al . 1995 ) selected samples .        by letting the gas density trace the dark matter density @xmath40 and by assuming that the plasma emissivity of the gas is constant , we computed the x - ray emissivity of the clusters , @xmath39 .",
    "given its importance on the results presented in this paper , here we discuss at some length the suitability of this approximation .",
    "( cooling of the gas is discussed in  [ rosat ] . )    for clusters in the process of formation or merging , the gas can have hot spots appearing where gas is being shock heated ( e.g. , frenk , evrard , summers , & white 1996 ) .",
    "one effect of such temperature fluctuations on the intrinsic x - ray emissivity is that the intrinsic plasma emissivity will vary substantially over the cluster thus rendering @xmath39 a poor approximation .",
    "however , the intrinsic x - ray emissivity is not observed , but rather that which is convolved with the spectral response of the detector .",
    "for @xmath11 observations of clusters with the pspc , the plasma emissivity is nearly constant over the relevant ranges of temperatures ( nra 91-ossa-3 , appendix f , @xmath11 mission description ) , and thus temperature fluctuations contribute negligibly to variations in the emissivity ; for previous discussions of this issue for the prs see bta and tb .",
    "a more serious issue is whether the shocking gas invalidates the @xmath41 approximation , in which case the dynamical state inferred from the gas would not reflect that of the underlying mass .",
    "tb , who analyzed the hydrodynamical simulation of navarro et al .",
    "( 1995a ) , showed that the prs computed for both the gas and the dark matter gave similar indications of the dynamical states of the simulated clusters ( see  4 of tb ) .",
    "in particular , this applied at early times when the clusters underwent mergers with massive subclusters .",
    "hence , our approximation for the x - ray emissivity should be reasonable even during the early , formative stages of clusters .",
    "another possible concern with setting @xmath41 is that a gas in hydrostatic equilibrium , which should be a more appropriate description for clusters in the later stages of their evolution , traces the shape of the potential of the gravitating matter which is necessarily rounder than the underlying mass ; if the gas is rounder , then the prs will be _",
    "smaller_. however , the core radius ( or scale length ) of the radial profile of the gas also influences the prs .",
    "in fact , clusters with larger core radii have _ larger _ prs ; see bta who computed prs for toy x - ray cluster models having a variety of ellipticities and core radii .",
    "when isothermal gas , which is a good approximation for a nearly relaxed cluster , is added to the potential generated by an average cluster formed in a @xmath14 , cdm simulation , the gas necessarily has a _ larger _ core radius than that of the dark matter ( see figure 14 of navarro , frenk , & white 1995b ) .",
    "hence , a gas in hydrostatic equilibrium will have a larger core radius than that of the dark matter , at least in the context of the cdm models we are studying . considering the competing effects of smaller ellipticity and larger core radii ( factors of 2 - 3 in each ) , and from consulting table 6 of bta , we conclude that no clear bias in the prs is to be expected by assuming that the gas follows the dark matter . in further support of this conclusion",
    "are the similarities of the morphologies of clusters in the n - body study of jing et al .",
    "using centroid - shifts and axial ratios they find similar results when @xmath41 and when the gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium ( see their figures 5 , 6 , and 8)",
    ".      having chosen our representation for the x - ray emissivity , we then generated two - dimensional `` images '' for each cluster .",
    "a rectangular box of dimensions @xmath42 @xmath43 mpc@xmath44 with random orientation was constructed about each cluster .",
    "we converted the particle distribution for each cluster to a mass density field using the interpolation technique employed in smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) ( e.g. , hernquist & katz 1989 ) , from which the x - ray emissivity was generated , @xmath39 .",
    "the sph interpolation calculates the density at a grid point by searching for the nearest neighbors and is thus more robust and physical than other linear interpolation schemes like cloud - in - cell . for our sph interpolation",
    "we use 20 neighbors and the spline kernel described in hernquist & katz .",
    "the interpolation result is independent of the cell we choose for the x - ray emissivity calculations .",
    "typically , the boxes contained @xmath45 particles for a cluster ; e.g. , scdm ( 1799 - 3965 ) , ocdm ( 1359 - 3656 ) , lcdm ( 1439 - 3877 ) , and bcdm ( 603 - 1740 ) .",
    "we projected the emissivity along the long edge of the box into a square @xmath46 @xmath47 mpc@xmath48 `` image '' consisting of `` pixels '' of width @xmath49 kpc .",
    "this pixel width was chosen sufficiently small so as not to inhibit reliable computation the prs .",
    "we do not add statistical noise or other effects associated with real observations to the x - ray images since our principal objective is to examine the intrinsic response of cluster morphologies to different cosmological parameters .",
    "however , the investigation of observational effects on the prs by bta , and the derived error bars on the prs from @xmath11 clusters by btb , do not show any large systematic biases ; comparison of the simulations to the @xmath11 cluster sample is discussed in  [ disc ] .",
    "the prs are derived from the multipole expansion of the two - dimensional gravitational potential , @xmath50 , generated by the mass density , @xmath51 , interior to @xmath52 , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the azimuthal angle , @xmath55 is the gravitational constant and , @xmath56 because of various advantageous properties of x - ray images of clusters , we associate the surface mass density , @xmath57 , with x - ray surface brightness , @xmath58 ( which is derived from the projection of @xmath13  see previous section ) ; for more complete discussions of this association see bta and tb . the square of each term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqn.multipole ] ) integrated over the boundary of a circular aperture of radius @xmath59 is given by ( ignoring factors of @xmath60 ) , @xmath61 for @xmath62 and , @xmath63 ^ 2,\\label{eqn.power0}\\ ] ] for @xmath64 .",
    "it is more useful for studies of cluster structure to consider the ratios of the higher order terms to the monopole term , @xmath65 , which we call `` power ratios '' ( prs ) . by dividing each term by @xmath66 we normalize to the flux within @xmath59 . because for clusters , @xmath67 for @xmath62 ( e.g. , btb ) , it is preferable to take the logarithm of the prs , @xmath68 which we shall henceforward analyze in this paper .",
    "since the @xmath69 depend on the origin of the chosen coordinate system , we consider two choices for the origin .",
    "first , we take the aperture to lie at the centroid of @xmath58 ; i.e. where @xmath70 vanishes .",
    "of these centroided @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 prove to be the most useful for studying cluster morphologies ( see bta ) . in order to extract information from the dipole term",
    ", we also consider the origin located at the peak of @xmath58 .",
    "we denote this dipole ratio by @xmath75 , and its logarithm @xmath76 , to distinguish it from the centroided power ratios .    to obtain the centroid of @xmath58 in a consistent manner for all clusters we adopted the following procedure .",
    "first , when projecting the cluster ( see  [ xray ] ) , the cluster was roughly centered on the x - ray image by eye . for each image we computed the centroid in a circular aperture with @xmath77 @xmath78 mpc located about the field center .",
    "this centroid was then used as our initial center for each cluster ; see bta for a description of how the peak of @xmath58 is located .",
    "in addition to considering the @xmath71 individually , we also analyze the cluster distributions along the `` evolutionary tracks '' in the @xmath79 and @xmath80 planes obeyed by the @xmath11 clusters of btb .",
    "we refer the reader to tb for a detailed discussion of the cluster properties along the evolutionary tracks .    using the augmented edge et al .",
    "( 1990 ) sample of btb we recomputed the lines defining the evolutionary tracks of the @xmath11 data for the @xmath81 mpc apertures .",
    "this was done since tb selected a subset of the clusters based on @xmath71 measurement uncertainty rather than flux .",
    "following tb we fit @xmath82 considering the uncertainties in both axes ; a similar fit was done for the @xmath80 plane .",
    "we obtained @xmath83 , @xmath84 for the @xmath79 track which we denote by @xmath85 .",
    "similarly , for the @xmath80 track , which we denote by @xmath86 , we obtained @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "these results are nearly the same found by tb for the slightly different sample .",
    "to facilitate comparison to a previous study of the @xmath71 of @xmath11 clusters ( btb ) , we compute @xmath71 of the simulated clusters in apertures ranging in radius from @xmath89 mpc to @xmath90 mpc ( @xmath91 km s@xmath24 mpc@xmath24 ) in steps of @xmath92 mpc ; i.e. @xmath93 mpc in steps of @xmath94 mpc .",
    "we refer the reader to  2 of bta and  2 of tb for discussions of the advantages of using a series of fixed metric aperture sizes to study cluster morphologies .",
    "first we consider clusters formed in the scdm , ocdm , and lcdm models .",
    "contour plots for 16 of the clusters formed in each of the models are displayed in figures [ fig.scdm ] , [ fig.ocdm ] , and [ fig.lcdm ] . in figure [ fig.p2p4cdm ]",
    "we show the @xmath95 plane for the @xmath89 mpc and @xmath96 mpc apertures ; the scdm model appears in each plot for comparison .",
    "the clusters in each of the models exhibit tight correlations very similar to the evolutionary tracks of the @xmath11 clusters ( btb ) and the simulated hydrodynamic clusters @xmath2 of navarro et al .",
    "( 1995a ) studied by tb . along the evolutionary tracks a shift in the means of the @xmath71 is easily noticeable in the @xmath89 mpc aperture , being most apparent for the scdm - ocdm models .",
    "the spread of the @xmath71 along the track in the @xmath96 mpc aperture for scdm - ocdm also appears to be different .",
    "the distributions perpendicular to @xmath85 do not show discrepancies obvious to the eye .    at this time we shift our focus away from the evolutionary tracks and instead analyze the individual @xmath71 distributions , which prove to be more powerful for distinguishing between cosmological models as we show below .",
    "we give the individual @xmath71 distributions of clusters in the three models for the @xmath89 mpc and @xmath96 mpc apertures in figures [ fig.prhist.05mpc ] and [ fig.prhist.10mpc ] .",
    "we found it most useful to compare these distributions in terms of their means , variances , and kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) statistics .",
    "for the number of clusters in each of our simulations ( 39 ) higher order statistics like the skewness and kurtosis are unreliable `` high variance '' distribution shape estimates ( e.g. , bird & beers 1993 ) .",
    "we did consider more robust statistics like the `` asymmetry index '' ( ai ) , which measures a quantity similar to the skewness , and the `` tail index '' ( ti ) , which is similar to the kurtosis ( bird & beers 1993 ) .",
    "however , we found that they did not clearly provide useful information in addition to the lower order statistics and ks test , and thus we do not discuss them further .",
    "the means and standard deviations for the @xmath97 mpc apertures are listed in table [ table.avgpr ] . as a possible aid to understanding the relationships between the values in table [ fig.avgpr.omega ] ,",
    "we plot in figure [ fig.avgpr.omega ] the standard deviation vs the mean for the @xmath98 mpc aperture .",
    "we do not present the results for the larger apertures because they did not significantly improve the ability to distinguish between the models .",
    "moreover , we found that @xmath74 and @xmath76 do not provide much useful information in addition to @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "generally @xmath74 tracks the behavior of @xmath72 , though showing less power to discriminate between models ; the similarity to @xmath72 is understandable given the strong correlation shown in figure [ fig.p2p4cdm ] .",
    "likewise , @xmath76 is similar to , but not quite so effective as , @xmath73 . for compactness , thus , we shall henceforward mostly restrict our discussion to results for @xmath72 and @xmath73 in the @xmath97 mpc apertures .",
    "we compare the means , standard deviations , and total distributions of the models in table [ table.test ] using standard non - parametric tests as described in press et al .",

    "note that for the cases where the f - test gives a probability less than 5% we use the variant of the t - test appropriate for distributions with significantly different variances ( i.e. program _",

    "since the ks test does not indicate discrepancy when both the t - test and f - test indicate similarity , we conclude that higher order properties of the pr distributions are probably not very important for the scdm and ocdm models ( at least for the samples of 39 clusters in our simulations ) . since this qualitative behavior holds for the other model comparisons , we shall not emphasize the ks tests henceforward .    finally , in terms of the various significance tests we find that the @xmath85 distribution essentially gives a weighted probability of the individual @xmath72 and @xmath74 distributions ; i.e. it does not enhance the discrepancy in the individual distributions .",

    "<S> we examine the sensitivity of the spatial morphologies of galaxy clusters to @xmath0 and @xmath1 using high - resolution n - body simulations with large dynamic range . </S>",
    "<S> variants of the standard cdm model are considered having different spatial curvatures , scdm @xmath2 , ocdm @xmath3 , lcdm @xmath4 , and different normalizations , @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we also explore critical density models with different spectral indices , @xmath6 , of the scale - free power spectrum , @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> cluster x - ray morphologies are quantified with power ratios ( prs ) , where we take for the x - ray emissivity @xmath8 , which we argue is a suitable approximation for analysis of prs . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath0 primarily influences the means of the pr distributions whereas the power spectrum ( @xmath6 and @xmath5 ) primarily affects their variances : @xmath9 is the cleanest probe of @xmath0 since its mean is very sensitive to @xmath0 but very insensitive to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the pr means easily distinguish the scdm and ocdm models , while the scdm and lcdm means show a more modest , but significant , difference @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the ocdm and lcdm models are largely indistinguishable in terms of the prs . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we compared these models to a sample of @xmath11 clusters and find that the pr means of the scdm clusters exceed the @xmath11 means with a high formal level of significance @xmath12 . though the formal significance level of this @xmath13 / x - ray comparison should be considered only approximate , we argue that taking into account the hydrodynamics and cooling will not reconcile a discrepancy this large . </S>",
    "<S> the pr means of the ocdm clusters are consistent , and the means of the lcdm clusters are marginally consistent , with those of the @xmath11 clusters . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we conclude that cluster morphologies strongly disfavor @xmath14 , cdm while favoring low density , cdm models with or without a cosmological constant . </S>"
