    "this sort of system straddles the line between potential companion types .",
    "it could be a double - neutron star ( dns ) , of which there are only roughly 12 and whose study is crucial to understanding the formation of sources of khz gravitational waves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and testing general relativity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ", it could be a pulsar with a massive white dwarf companion  a so - called `` intermediate - mass binary pulsar '' ( imbp)that descended from a binary with a more massive companion than in traditional systems with pulsars and low - mass white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "imbp systems are rare , with fewer than 20 known , and massive white dwarfs are themselves rare , with fewer than 8% of the white dwarfs ( wds ) from optical surveys having masses above @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "understanding the formation and evolution of imbp systems provides a crucial piece in our understanding of binary evolution and pulsar recycling , and helps delineate evolutionary paths between low - mass nss and high - mass white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "@xcite used very long baseline interferometry astrometry to measure the parallax of  with exquisite precision .",
    "they find a distance of @xmath0pc ( it is the second closest binary pulsar system and one of the closest nss of any type ) .",
    "the astrometric data also suggested an edge - on orbit , opening up the possibility of a measurement of the shapiro delay @xcite , which gives two post - keplerian @xcite parameters for the system and hence determines the component masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "here we present the detailed timing analysis of the  system , including the measurement of the shapiro delay and the determination of the masses ( ) .",
    "we then present deep optical and near - infrared searches for the companion to  ( ) , which we use to constrain models of its formation and evolution ( ) .",
    "we find that the system almost certainly must be an imbp system , but that we do not detect the companion , constraining it to be one of the coolest white dwarfs ever observed .",
    "unlike some sources where temperature inferences are highly dependent on white dwarf model atmospheres ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this measurement is robust , given the small uncertainties on the mass and ( especially ) distance .",
    "we conclude in .",
    "radio observations of  to measure the shapiro delay occurred in the last week of 2011 may with the 100 m robert c.  byrd gbt .",
    "we had a 6hr observation taken around superior conjunction of the binary system augmented by five 2hr observations at each of the other five shapiro extrema , all using the green bank ultimate pulsar processing instrument ( guppi ; @xcite ) .",
    "the 800mhz of bandwidth centered at 1500mhz in two orthogonal polarizations was separated into 512 nyquist - sampled frequency channels of width 1.5625mhz via a polyphase filter bank .",
    "these channels , sampled at 8-bits , provided full polarization information and an effective time resolution of 0.64@xmath8s .",
    "each channel was coherently dedispersed at the nominal dispersion measure ( dm ) of the pulsar ( 3.27761pc@xmath9 at the time , although we later refined this measurement ) .",
    "each observing session was broken into 30-minute observations of separated by 60s calibration scans of the extragalactic radio source 3c  190 .",

    "the position angle of the linear polarization is given in the upper panel . as is the case with most msps",
    ", the polarization position angle variations do not permit a rotating vector model fit , so we can not constrain the emission geometry .",
    "[ fig : profile ] , scaledwidth=40.0% ]    data reduction was performed using the ` psrchive ` package @xcite .",
    "flux calibration used the on- and off - source scans of 3c  190 .",
    "this was followed by removal of radio frequency interference by the psrzap utility .",
    "the calibrated pulse profile determined from the long observation covering conjunction is given in .",
    "the data were aligned in time using the best ephemeris ( below ) , divided into 16 frequency channels , and re - fit for dispersion measure and rotation measure using a bootstrap error analysis .",
    "we found that the period - averaged flux density varied by a factor of a few over the course of long observations due to scintillation , with an average of 12mjy at 1500mhz .",
    "individual times - of - arrival ( toas ) were measured from the folded total - intensity profiles using the frequency domain algorithm in ` psrchive ` @xcite .",
    "a template was created by fitting three gaussians to the summed pulse profile . from these gaussian components",
    ", we created a noise - free template with the phase of the fundamental component in the frequency domain rotated to zero .",
    "the observations were divided into 2minute segments , with one toa measured for each segment . note that since interstellar scintillation caused the flux to vary considerably , there was a proportional change in the toa precision that varied over the data set .",
    "these data were combined with previous data taken for the discovery observations of  @xcite to produce a timing model .",
    "we used the `` dd '' model @xcite in ` tempo ` , which incorporates the shapiro delay .",
    "the astrometric data for this model were taken from @xcite , and we used the de421 jpl ephemeris @xcite .",
    "timing fits with no shapiro delay were statistically unacceptable , with an rms residual of @xmath10s ( @xmath11 for 931 degrees - of - freedom ) , and a clear shapiro delay signature was obvious in the residuals ( ) . with the shapiro delay included in the fit the rms residual was 4.2@xmath8s ( @xmath12 for 929 degrees - of - freedom ) , with no obvious remaining structure in the residuals ( varying the astrometric parameters within the uncertainties from @xcite changed the timing results by @xmath13 ) .",
    "the shapiro delay determines the inclination of the orbit and the companion mass ; this is then combined with the binary mass function to determine the pulsar s mass .",
    "due to the combination of several different and much less precise observing modes from earlier monitoring with the high - precision shapiro delay campaign , we estimated the timing parameters with a bootstrap error analysis .",

    "the remainder of the data were both less precise and less uniform , with a wider range of observation frequency and instrumental setup .",
    "this makes it difficult ( if not impossible ) to robustly constrain long - term secular changes like periastron precession ( @xmath17 ; @xcite ) . nonetheless , we tried a fit with @xmath17 fixed to the value predicted by general relativity ( @xmath18 ) .",

    "since we do not detect the optical counterpart of the companion , the first inference is that the companion could be a low - mass ns .",
    "it would be the lowest mass ns known @xcite , although it is only a roughly 23 @xmath14 excursion from the mean of the companions in dns systems @xcite : rare , given the @xmath61dns systems , but not impossible .    in that case , its eccentricity of @xmath62 would be a factor of @xmath63 lower than any other dns system ( has the lowest eccentricity of @xmath64 , although this may be an ns  wd system ; @xcite ; van leeuwen et al .",
    "2014 , , submitted ) . in",
    "we show the eccentricity versus component masses for all dns and ns  wd systems with well - determined masses .",
    "in fact there are three ns  wd systems with higher eccentricities : , which was likely not recycled @xcite ; , which has had its eccentricity increased by dynamical interactions @xcite ; and ( likely an imbp , with the eccentricity the result of unstable mass transfer ; @xcite ) .",
    "the normal formation scenario for a dns involves two core - collapse supernova explosions , with the eccentricity the result of the second explosion and its kick , and no final mass - transfer phase to circularize the orbit ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , formation via an electron - capture supernova ( ecs ; @xcite ) could result in a significantly lower ns mass ( @xcite ; @xcite ) along with a lower supernova kick @xcite .",
    "has a low transverse velocity ( @xmath65 ) , although higher than some systems thought to be the products of ecss ( given the age of the system , this velocity may be more related to motion in the galactic potential than birth conditions ) .",
    "this may reflect the velocity dispersion of the progenitor systems .",
    "however , the contrast between  and other systems thought to be the results of ecss ( e.g. , psr  j1906 + 0746 or ; @xcite ) is extreme , with the ratio of eccentricities above 200 as mentioned previously . in a scenario without a kick we can place an upper limit on the amount of material that could have been ejected by the explosion to @xmath66 ( with @xmath67 the pulsar mass and @xmath68 the current companion mass ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is a much tighter bound than in any of the other systems proposed for this mechanism , and difficult to reconcile with the change in binding energy needed to collapse to a ns @xmath69 ( with @xmath70 km for an ns ) , presumably released as neutrinos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : this leads to the horizontal line in , above which all confirmed dns systems are found . in order to have a dns system with such a low eccentricity",
    ", we need to invoke increasingly exotic ( and perhaps implausible ) evolutionary scenarios .",
    "for instance , if the system began as a hierarchical triple @xcite , then the inner components could have formed a standard eccentric dns system early on",
    ". later evolution of the outer member could have led to a circum - binary accretion disk that would have worked to circularize the inner system , after which the outer object would have exploded or otherwise been ejected from the system .",
    "the other possible scenario is that the companion could be a massive wd , making the system an imbp .",
    "its orbital eccentricity is somewhat high compared to most low - mass binary pulsars of similar periods ( based on @xcite ) , but not nearly as high as a dns , consistent with an imbp classification @xcite .",
    "it falls in the locus of other co wds in the `` corbet '' ( binary period versus spin period ) diagram in @xcite . the pulsar mass is lower than most pulsar ",
    "wd binaries , but is consistent with the short orbital - period imbp discussed by @xcite which may indicate a similar formation mechanism involving a common envelope @xcite .",
    "however , as a wd it would be extremely faint : far fainter than any of the optical companions to imbps currently known @xcite or indeed any wd companion to a millisecond pulsar ( msp ) with a similar mass @xcite ; it is perhaps the faintest wd ever observed . with the apparent magnitude limits from",
    ", we can compute absolute magnitude limits in each band .",
    "we use the distance @xmath71pc @xcite , and we estimate the extinction to be @xmath72mag from @xcite . in terms of bolometric luminosity the most constraining limit ends up coming from the @xmath38-band data , where we limit @xmath73 ( the @xmath47-band limit of @xmath74 is very similar , given slight differences in bolometric correction ) . for comparison , the companion to with a median companion mass of @xmath75 has @xmath76 @xcite . in",
    "we plot the absolute magnitude against mass for pulsar+wd systems as well as select cool wds with parallax distances : even compared to the observed truncation of the cooling sequence in old halo globular clusters like ngc  6397 @xcite or m4 @xcite , the putative companion is far fainter : at the distance of ngc  6397 , our limit of @xmath73 translates to an apparent magnitude of @xmath77 , compared to @xmath78 , or @xmath79 for the coolest wds seen in ngc  6397 .",
    "some of the difference comes from the change in radius : a @xmath80 wd has a radius about 65% of that of a typical @xmath81 wd , leading to a 1mag change in brightness at the same effective temperature .",
    "but the difference in is more like 2.5mag , so the companion to  must also be cooler than the known thick disk / halo wds .    beyond the absolute magnitude , which is directly computable from observable quantities , we can limit the radius / temperature of a putative wd by using our @xmath38-band absolute magnitude limit to constrain the bolometric luminosity .",
    "this is more complicated , as it involves atmosphere calculations in an uncertain and poorly tested regime , but it should be reasonably reliable .",
    "we use the synthetic photometry and evolutionary models from @xcite and @xcite for h and he atmospheres , respectively . ] . for isolated wds pure he atmospheres",
    "can be largely excluded because of bondi - hoyle accretion from the ism @xcite , and even small amounts of hydrogen mixed into the helium can cause near - infrared flux deficiencies like pure hydrogen ( see below ; @xcite ) . however , the binary orbit and msp wind in this system could have inhibited such accretion and therefore a he atmosphere is possible . in any case",
    "a pure he atmosphere will serve as a limiting case compared to the h models .",
    "these models are used to convert the absolute magnitude limits into temperature limits , so for simplicity we use the @xmath80 models ( differences in bolometric corrections as a function of mass are small , @xmath82mag ) .",
    "the most constraining limit is again from the @xmath38-band data , where @xmath73 implies @xmath83k ( see ) for a h atmosphere .",
    "the he - atmosphere models do not extend to sufficiently cool temperatures but stop at @xmath84k with @xmath85 . at lower temperatures the details of the atmospheric physics are rather uncertain , but a blackbody is likely an acceptable approximation ( p.  bergeron , 2014 , private communication ) . with a he atmosphere",
    "an effective temperature @xmath86k would be required ( ) . the h limits are more constraining since more of the flux appears in the optical regime rather than the near - infrared  a consequence of collisionally induced absorption by molecular h@xmath87 @xcite .",
    "these limits change slightly with mass given the small but finite mass uncertainties , since the radius would change with mass : going to the @xmath88 h model we can constrain @xmath89k ( at our nominal mass of @xmath90 the radius of a c / o wd is about @xmath91 , and it scales as @xmath92 ) . as inferred from",
    ", the companion to  would be far cooler than any known wd from other surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the coolest objects tend to have @xmath93k .",
    "however , we can not exclude such a very cool wd on age grounds .",
    "wd cooling curves , which start out having more massive objects warmer at the same age , eventually cross to have more massive objects cooler at the same age (; this is also visible in ) .",
    "this is because massive wds crystallize earlier , at a higher @xmath94  ( but at a similar internal temperature ) , at which point the faster debye cooling takes over @xcite .",
    "cooling ages for these models may not be reliable , as the impacts of state changes , sedimentation , and chemical processes are not precisely known , and the atmospheres are not trivial to calculate @xcite .",
    "but we believe conservatively that the cooling age is close to 10gyr , almost certainly @xmath95gyr . in we",
    "show example cooling curves , computed for thin and thick da atmospheres and c / o wds ( likely irradiation is a negligible perturbation to the wds surface temperature , given the measured spin - down luminosity of the pulsar ) . for the model closest to the best - fit mass of  we would infer that the true age is near 9gyr , with the possible range from 612gyr .",
    "the upper limit provided by the pulsar s characteristic spin - down age ( 34gyr after correction for the shklovskii effect [ @xcite ] ) is not constraining ; the assumption that the pulsar s initial spin period is much shorter than the current spin period is clearly not valid .",
    "instead , we take as our upper limit to the age that of the milky way s halo ( @xmath96gyr ; @xcite ) minus the @xmath97myr required for the main - sequence lifetime of a @xmath98 progenitor @xcite , although this does not really exclude any models .",
    "such an age would , however , imply a lower limit to the ( re-)birth period of about 25ms , assuming spin - down with a braking index @xmath99 ( magnetic dipole radiation ) .",
    "we note that the cooling models in may not be the only solution for this progenitor : changing the wd composition ( likely it is below the transition to o / ne / mg wds based on @xcite , although binary evolution could change that ; also see @xcite ) or atmosphere ( helium , carbon , etc ) could lead to different solutions , and to draw robust conclusions we need to explore a wider range of models with better observational constraints .",
    "there are also considerable complications and uncertainties in models for these temperatures : for instance , the models of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* the basti database ) give rather different ages as @xmath94  never drops below @xmath100k for @xmath80 models , even for ages of @xmath101gyr , while @xcite and @xcite do have @xmath102 models go below 4000k ( note that the models in @xcite are primarily o / ne rather than c / o ) .",
    "however , we believe the @xmath94  upper limits to be more robust , as they do tend to agree between different calculations .     while extreme , the companion to  may not be especially unique .",
    "similar ultra - cool wds are presumably present in globular clusters and in the field even if they are often too faint to identify on their own .",
    "individual ultra - cool wds can be identified but only if very nearby , like the two objects in @xcite at @xmath103pc . if we correct roughly for the different progenitor masses between the @xcite systems and   @xcite and use a @xcite initial mass function , we would estimate @xmath104 massive wds of a similar age within 300pc , which is of the same order as the luminosity function from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* also see @xcite ) extrapolated and @xcite say that at most a few percent of wds are lost off the faint end of the luminosity function . ] to @xmath105 .",
    "instead , binary systems are the best way to identify cold wds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is effectively the technique used here .",
    "but even in binary systems where we know that a source is present , the systems will often be too distant for good constraints ( i.e. , psr  j1454@xmath245846 in ; @xcite ) .",
    "we still require a fortuitously nearby system for useful observations .",
    "the occurrence of a nearby massive wd like the companion to  is reasonably consistent with expectations based on the observed binary population : there are five pulsar binaries from the atnf pulsar catalog @xcite within 300pc , and the other four have low - mass he wd companions .",
    "this @xmath106 ratio is similar to that for co wd compared to he wd companions in the whole atnf catalog ( also see @xcite ) , and the pulsars spin - down ages appear to have similar distributions for both companion types .",
    "finally , we can ask whether an ns is the most likely companion to an ultra - cool wd .",
    "most binaries are assumed to have mass ratios near one ( @xcite , but see @xcite ) , but a binary composed of two ultra - cool wds would be just as hard to detect optically as a single object .",
    "if the companion were a lower - mass wd or a main - sequence star the binary could be visible , although it would require spectroscopic follow - up to identify the companion and in the absence of _ gaia _ this has not been done for the majority of stars within a few hundred pc .",
    "so the situation of , with an ns companion , is reasonably plausible as the initial mass ratio would have been close to one and the chances of companion follow - up and identification after discovery of the pulsar are high .",
    "we have determined an accurate mass for the partially recycled pulsar  and its companion ; the latter is value consistent with both an ns and a wd . despite not finding the companion in a deep optical / near - infrared search",
    ", we reject a dns explanation as the binary system shows evidence of circularization requiring mass transfer after the last supernova .",
    "instead the companion is likely a high - mass wd . using the extremely precise distance determination from @xcite",
    ", we can set a robust limit of @xmath107 .",
    "this implies an very old and cool wd : fainter than all other pulsar companions by a factor of about 100 , and fainter than the lower - mass `` ultra - cool '' wd in the solar neighborhood by a factor of about four .",
    "converting this limit to a temperature depends somewhat on the assumed mass and composition , but we believe an effective temperature limit of @xmath108k is a robust upper limit .",
    "for such an object to not be older than the milky way requires that it have already entered the faster debye cooling regime , i.e. , that it already crystallized ( also see @xcite ) . future searches , if they can detect the companion to , will be a unique probe of the very late stages of wd evolution , with a well - determined mass and radius that are not usually available for studies of such objects .",
