    "aggregation processes are outstanding phenomena that have been subject of theoretical , experimental and simulation investigations in many fields of knowledge @xcite .",
    "the diffusion limited aggregation ( dla ) model proposed by witten and sander @xcite is the most studied theoretical aggregation process . in this model ,",
    "free particles are released , one at a time , far from a growing cluster and perform successive random jumps while they are not adjacent to the cluster .",
    "if a free particle encounters any particle of the cluster , it irreversibly sticks in the corresponding position and becomes part of the cluster . notwithstanding the rule simplicity , the dla model produces clusters exhibiting complex scaling properties @xcite .",
    "another simple and well studied growth process is the so called ballistic aggregation ( ba ) , in which the free particles move ballistically at randomly chosen directions and obey the same sticking rules as the dla model .",
    "the ba model produces asymptotically homogeneous radial clusters @xcite whose active ( growing ) zone is described by kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) universality class  @xcite , as observed in the planar version where the flux of particles is normal to an initially flat substrate  @xcite .",
    "several generalizations of the dla model have been studied @xcite with special attention in those where the free particles perform random walks with a drift @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the clusters undergo a crossover from a dla to a ba scaling regime as the number of particles increases due to the trajectories become essentially ballistic at asymptotic large scales . in another group of models ,",
    "in which the free particles perform long random steps of a fixed length , an inverted transition from ba to dla is observed @xcite . in this case , the trajectories are essentially random at asymptotic large scales , independently of the step length .",
    "a simple characterization of the morphological transition is done by relating the mass @xmath3 of an aggregate with its radius @xmath4 .",
    "this quantity has two asymptotic scaling regimes , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , related to either the dla or ba models , respectively .",
    "aggregation models with drift or long steps can be used to investigate systems with a long mean free path as , for example , the aggregation of methane or ammonia molecules in superfluid helium @xcite . in particular , an off - lattice dla model with long steps of length @xmath7 was recently applied to the aggregation of molecules in superfluid media @xcite .",
    "in addition to this example , biased diffusion and super - diffusivity have also been reported in several systems ranging from adatom surface diffusion @xcite to cell migration @xcite .",
    "the relevance of modelling the aggregation with this kind of random walk is strengthened due to biased diffusion may be misleadingly confused with super - diffusivity @xcite .",
    "the representation of a large mean free path by a ballistic movement is a simplifying hypothesis since weak perturbations can promote slight deviations of the ballistic path resulting a biased diffusion at short scales .",
    "motivated by the wide availability of systems for potential applications , we investigate a two - dimensional aggregation process where the particle trajectories consist of random walks , with the direction of a new step limited by an angle @xmath8 in relation to the previous step direction .",
    "this correlated walk , which was formerly investigated in other contexts @xcite , has a drift at short scales and becomes a random walk at large scales .",
    "also , an aggregation model using this random walk was formerly investigated in a small cluster size limit and a fractal dimension depending on the @xmath8 parameter was reported  @xcite . actually , this dependence is a finite size effect since this kind of trajectory lead to a ba to dla crossover , as demonstrated in the present work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "model and simulation strategies are presented in section [ model ] .",
    "the trajectories are numerically investigated and an analytical approach for the trajectory crossover is developed in section [ sec : scaling ] . in section",
    "[ results ] , the simulations of large clusters are presented and a scaling analysis of the morphological transition is developed . finally , some conclusions and prospects are drawn in the section [ conclusions ] .",
    "we perform two - dimensional off - lattice simulations with an initial cluster consisting of a single particle of diameter @xmath9 ( a seed ) stuck to the origin .",
    "free particles are sequentially released , one at a time , at a circle of radius @xmath10 centred at the seed , where @xmath11 is the largest distance from the seed of a particle belonging to the cluster .",
    "the free particles follow a persistent random walk @xcite , in which the position of the @xmath12th step is given by @xmath13 and the direction of the @xmath12th step depends on the preceding one as @xmath14 the white noise @xmath15 is a random variable uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath16 and the parameter @xmath8 limits the next move direction inside an angular opening of size @xmath8 centred in the direction of the previous step .",
    "the trajectory becomes ballistic for @xmath17 and random for @xmath18 implying in the ba and dla limit cases , respectively .",
    "the direction of the first step is chosen at random .",
    "the trajectory is stopped whenever the particle visits a position adjacent to the cluster where it irreversibly sticks .",
    "finally , the particle is discarded whenever it crosses a distance @xmath19 .",
    "the procedure is repeated up to the cluster reaches @xmath20 particles . the previously introduced variables @xmath21 and @xmath22 must be as large as possible , but computational limitations restrict their values .",
    "for the dla simulations , @xmath23 can be a few particle diameters  @xcite .",
    "however , for the ba limit , @xmath23 can not be small due to distortions caused by shadow instabilities @xcite .",
    "the ba clusters are free from shadow effects when @xmath24 and thus @xmath25 and @xmath26 were adopted in all simulations .",
    "since the asymptotic behaviour be typically reached only for large clusters , an efficient algorithm is required .",
    "we adopted the strategy where particles execute long steps with the proper angular distribution @xmath27 if they are not close to the cluster @xcite . a closed expression for the angular distribution of a long jump is not known a priori .",
    "so , we numerically computed the probability of the first passage in a circle of radius @xmath4 occurring at an angle @xmath28 for a trajectory started at the origin .",
    "figure [ ang_dist ] shows some angular distributions for different values of @xmath8 and @xmath4 obtained with up to @xmath29 independent trajectories . if @xmath4 and @xmath8 are not too large , the distributions are very well fitted by @xmath30 parameters @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( actually only two of them are independent due to the normalization ) were determined using non - linear regressions that are also shown in fig .",
    "[ ang_dist ] .",
    "cluster growth optimizations were implemented using steps of size @xmath34 in the large empty regions nearby the cluster and three step sizes ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) were used far from the cluster .",
    "more details about long step and off - lattice optimizations are available elsewhere @xcite .",
    "figure [ walks ] shows two stages of a trajectory corresponding to short and long times . roughly , the trajectory consists in a drift around the initial direction until a large angular fluctuation be selected , as illustrated in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ walks ] .",
    "the smaller angular opening the rarer the probability of a large fluctuation be selected .",
    "however , these rare events unavoidably occur for a sufficiently long time if @xmath37 and the trajectories become erratic at large scales , as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ walks ] . in order to investigate this crossover",
    ", @xmath38 independent trajectories were simulated . in fig . [ rw_scaling ]",
    "the root - mean - square ( rms ) displacement @xmath39 is show for several values of @xmath8 .",
    "one can clearly resolve a crossover : the rms displacement scales as @xmath40 at early stages and crosses over to a scaling @xmath41 , as expected in a transition from ballistic to diffusive trajectories .",
    "the characteristic crossover time depends on the angular opening as @xmath42 .",
    "this result can be proved with the following reasoning . without loss of generality , we assume @xmath43 in eq . resulting @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a white noise with @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 means statistical averages .",
    "obviously , the turning angle is a random variable with @xmath49 . applying the central limit theorem @xcite , in which the sum of @xmath50 identical and independent random variables with average @xmath51 and variance @xmath52 converges to a normal distribution with variance @xmath53 , the probability of a large turning angle be selected is exponentially negligible for @xmath54 and appreciable for @xmath55 . assuming a crossover time given by @xmath56 we immediately find out the scaling law @xmath57 . finally , the characteristic rms displacement at the crossover is proportional to @xmath58 since the trajectory is still approximately ballistic at the crossover .",
    "these scaling properties @xmath39 can be expressed in the following scaling ansatz @xmath59 where the scaling function @xmath60 has the properties @xmath61 for @xmath62 and @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "as one can see in fig .",
    "[ rw_collapse ] , this ansatz collapses the data shown in fig .",
    "[ rw_scaling ] onto a universal curve if we plot @xmath65 against @xmath66 , demonstrating the ansatz correctness .    before analysing the aggregates obtained using the persistent random walk ,",
    "we shortly draw a comparison with the results reported by tojo and argyrakis for this persistent random walk @xcite , in which a scaling @xmath67 was numerically obtained in stochastic simulations .",
    "this exponent , that is slightly different from ours , results from the crossover times estimated using the intersections between early and long time scaling laws of @xmath39 versus @xmath50 .",
    "we instead deduced the scaling behaviours and the theory perfectly matches the numerical simulations as shown in fig .",

    "figure [ stages ] shows different stages of two clusters obtained for angular openings @xmath68 and @xmath69 . in both cases ,",
    "the change of the cluster morphology is evident . at early stages",
    ", the aggregates have dense branched morphologies ( low density of inner voids ) that resemble the ba patterns while sparse branches , the hallmark of dla clusters , are obtained after a characteristic number of particles .",
    "this behaviour qualitatively confirms the morphological crossover predicted with the trajectory properties : the smaller @xmath8 the longer the crossover time .",
    "figure [ patterns ] shows clusters of the same size obtained with distinct @xmath8 values .",
    "the simulations were stopped when the clusters reached a circle of radius @xmath70 . a transition from dense to ramified structures is observed and a fractal dimension dependent on @xmath8 can effectively be measured in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite . however , it is important to notice that the dense morphologies are transient and the patterns unavoidably become ramified with the dla fractal dimension ( @xmath71 ) for asymptotic large clusters .",
    "the quantitative characterization of the crossover was done using the mass - radius method @xcite .",
    "clusters were grown until they cross a circle of radius @xmath72 . in order to perform statistical averages ,",
    "100 independent samples were simulated for each investigated @xmath8 value .",
    "the mass - radius method consists in determining the number of particles inside a circle of radius @xmath4 centred in the seed . in general , the mass scales as @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the fractal dimension .",

    "+    figure [ massradius ] shows the mass - radius curves corresponding to different values of @xmath8 .",

    "the mass is described by a scaling form @xmath78 where @xmath79 for @xmath62 and @xmath80 for @xmath81 . this scaling ansatz supposes that the crossover radius scales as @xmath82 .",
    "it also assumes a constraint @xmath83 due to the clusters still are dense close to the crossover , explaining the exponent @xmath84 in eq .",
    "( [ mass_scaling ] ) . determining the crossover radius as the intersection between the scaling laws @xmath85 and @xmath86 , we obtained a scaling law very close to @xmath87 .",
    "we also evaluated the mass at the crossover and the relation @xmath88 was confirmed . the crossover mass and radius against @xmath8",

    "[ colapso ] the mass - radius curves are collapsed using the scaling ansatz given by eq . with the exponent @xmath89 . as can be seen ,",

    "the mass against radius can be written as @xcite @xmath92 where the scaling laws @xmath93 and @xmath94 are assumed for the crossover radius and the corresponding mass , respectively .",

    "we show analytically and numerically that this trajectory is effectively ballistic below a length scale @xmath99 and becomes random at large scales .",
    "this result improves the numerical estimate of the scaling law reported formerly by tojo and argyrakis @xcite .",
    "large scale simulations show that the aggregates undergo a morphological transition from a ballistic aggregation ( ba ) regime at small sizes to a dla - like ramified morphology at asymptotically large scales .",
    "it is important to mention that a previous analysis of this aggregation model @xcite , which was done in a small cluster size limit , states a non - universal fractal dimension .",
    "however , we have shown that the asymptotic behaviour of the clusters is described by the dla fractal dimension . finally , the crossover between the ba and dla scaling regimes is related with the angular opening by @xmath103 indicating a non - trivial relation between the characteristic size of the cluster in the crossover and the persistence length of the random walk .",
    "the persistent random walk has interesting features that can be associated to a number of physical systems @xcite .",
    "a small angular opening may represent a diffusion in a medium where the scattering is weak except by rare but no negligible fluctuations .",
    "an important example is the wandering / aggregation of molecules in superfluid helium @xcite where the particles may have a mean free path ranging from a molecule diameter to micrometers depending on the proximity to the critical temperature .",
    "this kind of diffusion is also observed in cell migration @xcite , a chemotactic process in which the cells diffuse following a gradient - mediated chemical signalling .",
    "a relevant property of the trajectory is a characteristic mean free path or persistence length that emerges naturally as we have demonstrated with the central limit theorem @xcite . in the cited examples , the aggregation and the consequent formation of clusters",
