    "recently various scenarios related to in - medium modifications of the properties of the @xmath3-meson have been proposed @xcite to explain the apparent increase in the production of dilepton pairs with an invariant mass around the @xmath3 meson in heavy ion collisions @xcite . to really be able to extract these signals , possibly due to a decrease in the @xmath3 mass as a result of chiral symmetry restoration",
    ", the description of the fundamental processes has to be on a firm ground and its inherent approximations have to be well understood . in this paper",
    "we will investigate the elementary process of dilepton pair production off nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "two ingredients are of importance here .",
    "first there is the question of the nucleon - nucleon form factor .",
    "vector meson dominance suggests a form which naturally gives a significant increase in the cross - section around the @xmath3 mass .",
    "however , while the concept is well established for the pion formfactor , for the nucleon formfactor its validity is much less clear @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will focus on a second point , the off - shell character of the @xmath2 interaction . from real photon bremsstrahlung",
    "one knows that already at pion threshold off - shell effects are crucial to describe the data . for virtual photon",
    "bremsstrahlung one might expect the effects to be even larger since the typical energies involved are much higher than for real photon bremsstrahlung and one thus can reach kinematics which are further off shell . in this paper",
    "we will present a calculation based on a @xmath0 matrix which includes @xmath1 degrees of freedom and fits the @xmath2 data up to 2 gev .",
    "we will compare our results with a previous calculation that uses a one boson exchange fit to the @xmath2 on - shell data to find its off - shell behaviour @xcite .",
    "the quantity of interest is the differential cross - section for production of lepton pairs with an invariant mass @xmath4 .",
    "it is most easily calculated in the c.m .",
    "frame of the incoming nucleon pair @xmath5^\\frac{1}{2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this expression @xmath6 is the elementary charge , @xmath7 the nucleon and electron masses respectively , @xmath8 the total incoming invariant mass and @xmath9 the momentum of the incoming nuclei . also , @xmath10 is the momentum of the outgoing nucleons relative to each other , its value is determined by energy conservation .",
    "the final nucleon pair thus has momenta @xmath11 , the energies of the final nucleon pair are denoted by @xmath12 . in the integration over the solid angle of @xmath10 , @xmath13 is taken relative to the photon momentum , @xmath14 .",
    "a similar notation is used for the dilepton pair , their momenta are @xmath15 , with corresponding energies @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath17 is the zero - th component of the photon momentum , @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 is the leptonic tensor describing the decay of the virtual photon into the dilepton pair , @xmath20.\\ ] ] @xmath21 is the matrix element for producing a virtual photon with rest mass @xmath4 off a nucleon - nucleon collision .",
    "the diagrams we include in the calculation of this amplitude are shown in fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] .",
    "we have the nucleon single - scattering ( [ diagrams]a ) , rescattering ( [ diagrams]b ) and @xmath1 single - scattering ( [ diagrams]c ) and rescatter diagrams ( [ diagrams]d ) .",
    "we include the same diagrams as in a previous study of real - photon bremsstrahlung @xcite , the expressions given there are readily generalized to the case of virtual photon production .    for the @xmath22 vertex we again use the standard form without formfactors @xmath23 where we defined the photon momentum @xmath24 to be outgoing .",
    "the form of the @xmath25 vertices is less well established .",
    "following jones and scadron @xcite we have the general form @xmath26 in these expressions the index @xmath27 is to be contracted with an index of the @xmath1 propagator , @xmath28 is the total momentum and @xmath29 is third component of the isospin transition matrix for coupling an isospin 3/2 to an isospin 1/2 particle .",
    "the @xmath30 component does not contribute in the case of a real photon ( @xmath31 ) and thus experimental input on this quantity is very limited .",
    "one attempt is the calculation of nozawa and lee @xcite of electroproduction of pions off the nucleon .",
    "however , using the values nozawa and lee employ we found that results were insensitive to the contribution from this vertex part and we can safely ignore this contribution .",
    "the most elaborate determinations of the @xmath32 and @xmath33 coupling constants come from fitting the @xmath34 and @xmath35 multipole data on the photoproduction of pions off nucleons @xcite . in judging these numbers we have to realize that in our calculation we treat the nucleon background differently .",
    "it is therefore the most realistic to take values from calculations where the nucleon background contribution in the @xmath36 channel is implicitly included in the coupling constants . in such an approach jones and scadron find @xmath37 ( gev@xmath38 ) and @xmath39 ( gev@xmath40 ) , which we will use in our calculation .",
    "this is very close to the values found in a recent analysis of lee @xcite : @xmath41 ( gev@xmath38 ) and @xmath42 ( gev@xmath40 ) . with these numbers we have to bear in mind that the dominant contribution of the vertex comes from the @xmath43 part and",
    "we can order the sets of values according to the value of @xmath32 , the accompanying value of @xmath33 has not much influence on the results .",
    "an independent method to find the values is assuming vector - dominance .",
    "then the values are determined by the ratio @xmath44 . using the values of ter haar @xcite we find @xmath45 ( gev@xmath38 ) and @xmath46 ( gev@xmath40 ) .",
    "this value is on the low end of the range of values found in pion - photoproduction . in ref .",
    "@xcite a value taken from the decay width of the @xmath1 into a photon and nucleon is used : @xmath47 ( gev@xmath38 ) and @xmath46 ( gev@xmath40 ) .    in calculating",
    "the diagrams we use a @xmath0-matrix that is based on the paris potential and additionally contain @xmath1-degrees of freedom .",
    "including @xmath1 degrees of freedom is essential for describing the inelastic channels and resonant structures in the phase - shifts .",
    "the resulting @xmath0-matrix describes the nucleon - nucleon data well up to 2 gev @xcite .",
    "other calculations of dilepton production use a less sophisticated description of the @xmath2 interaction .",
    "one approach is to develop a soft photon approximation for virtual photon bremsstrahlung as is done in ref .",
    "another possibility is to parametrize the on - shell nucleon scattering data by means of an one boson exchange interaction , and use this parametrization to extrapolate to the off - shell matrix elements which enter in the calculation of the matrix element @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "this method has certain limitations , first of all , the nn - scattering amplitude is not unitary due to its obe form . also , in the fit to the @xmath2 data in the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite the on - shell equivalence of the pseudo - scalar and pseudo - vector coupling makes the parameters independent of whether one chooses a pseudo - scalar or pseudo - vector pion - nucleon - nucleon vertex .",
    "however , the results for dilepton production do depend on this choice .",
    "although the contribution from the electric part of the vertex remains the same @xcite , the contribution from the magnetic part of the vertex is affected by this choice . using a @xmath0-matrix one",
    "has a more realistic description of the off - shell character of the @xmath2 interaction , since the off - shell amplitudes enter in the t - matrix equation and these are thus implicitly constrained by the fit to the @xmath2 data .",
    "for example , the degeneracy of the pseudo - scalar / pseudo - vector choice for the pion coupling is resolved to a large extent : one has to use different parameters to obtain the same fit .",
    "using a sophisticated description of the @xmath2 interaction has ramifications on other parts of the model .",
    "the current arising from the nucleonic diagrams ( figs .",
    "[ diagrams]a , b ) is not gauge - invariant since we do not include negative energy states in the intermediate propagators of the @xmath0-matrix .",
    "note that the @xmath1-decay diagrams are gauge - invariant due to the gauge invariant @xmath25 vertex . for real photon bremsstrahlung",
    "this is not too big a problem . in that case",
    "the current is gauge invariant up to order @xmath48 in the photon momentum .",
    "moreover , an actual calculation of the negative energy state contributions shows them to be small @xcite .    due to the fact that the matrix element for virtual photon bremsstrahlung depends on two independent quantities",
    "( the mass of the virtual photon and its momentum ) the situation for virtual photon - bremsstrahlung is less favourable . only in the c.m .",
    "frame of the virtual photon one can show that the matrix element is model independent only up to order @xmath49 .",
    "one also finds rather large differences between the various low energy theorems @xcite .",
    "this all implies that the issue of gauge invariance is more important for dilepton pair production than it is for real photon bremsstrahlung .",
    "the problem of a non - gauge invariant current is also encountered in models of @xmath50 reactions .",
    "various schemes have been devised to render a calculated current gauge invariant @xcite .",
    "of course neither scheme is unique and will lead to different results which can be related to the choice of a particular gauge @xcite .",
    "having noticed that our @xmath51 is particulary large as compared to the spatial components we decided to use the method of refs .",
    "@xcite and express @xmath51 in terms of @xmath52 to obtain a conserved current : @xmath53 the resulting amplitude then trivially fullfils the gauge - invariance condition .",
    "this choice has the advantage that in this scheme the results for real - photon bremsstrahlung are unaffected since this process is independent of @xmath51 .",
    "with the model described before we calculated the differential cross - section for production of dilepton pairs with invariant mass m for proton - proton collisions at 1 gev laboratory energy .",
    "we restrict ourselves to proton - proton collisions since in neutron - proton collisions meson - exchange - currents usually dominate , but are very elaborate to calculate in a @xmath0-matrix approach .",
    "we think that studying the pp reaction provides a clearer picture of the additional dynamics introduced by the use of a @xmath0-matrix .",
    "we choose a laboratory energy of 1 gev to still be in the range where the @xmath0-matrix provides a detailed description of the phase - shifts . at higher energies the total and inelastic cross - sections",
    "are still very well reproduced , but the reproduction of more sensitive observables like the polarization cross - sections is less satisfactory @xcite . since the latter is also true for other models that fit the @xmath2 data to high energies using a @xmath0-matrix formalism @xcite , one might argue that the description of @xmath2 scattering in terms of nucleon and meson degrees of freedom in terms of a @xmath0-matrix starts to break down and one has to include additional physics , like explicit quark degrees of freedom .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ results_1 ] . comparing our nucleonic contribution ( dash - dot - dot ) with the one of schfer _ et al . _",
    "( dash - dot ) we see a rather large difference . at low @xmath4",
    "our cross - section is around a factor 2 larger than the one of schfer . at higher",
    "@xmath4 the situation is reversed . there",
    "the cross - section of schfer is larger .",
    "this can be largely attributed to the choice of a pseudo - scalar pion vertex .",
    "taking a pseudo - vector pion coupling the result of schfer is reduced by a factor 10 and is again smaller than our result .",
    "the soft - photon result of ref .",
    "@xcite ( short - dashed line ) is even lower than the schfer result , and we can conclude that in our calculation the additional off - shell information we include leads to an enhancement of the nucleonic part of the cross - section . at the energies under consideration",
    "the total cross - section is dominated by the @xmath1 contributions , even more than we found for the real - photon bremsstrahlung case @xcite . to show the dependence of the total results on the strength of the @xmath54 vertex we performed calculations with a strong coupling @xmath37 ( gev@xmath38 ) and @xmath39 ( gev@xmath40 , dotted line ) and with the relatively weak vector dominance value @xmath45 ( gev@xmath38 ) and @xmath46 ( gev@xmath40 , dashed line ) .",
    "the result of schfer @xmath47 ( gev@xmath38 ) and @xmath46 ( gev@xmath40 ) is represented by the solid line .",
    "the result with the weak coupling is about 25 % smaller than the one with the strong coupling . as stated before , these values are on the high and low end of the spectrum found in various pion - photoproduction models and thus represent a natural measure of the theoretical uncertainty .",
    "the results of schfer _ et al .",
    "_ nicely fall in between and the overall agreement between both models is reassuring .",
    "it remains to be seen whether the similarities hold when looking at more refined observables , like e.g. anisotropies of the dilepton pairs @xcite .",
    "another point of additional investigation is the influence of form - factors",
    ". a straightforward application of vector dominance will give us simply an upward shift in the cross - section , increasing with increasing invariant mass @xmath4 .",
    "however , a more detailed calculation of the form - factors , as performed in ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the vector dominance assumption is too general for the nucleonic form - factor .    in conclusion",
    ", we presented a calculation of dilepton production at 1 gev laboratory energy using a @xmath0 matrix that includes @xmath1 degrees of freedom and provides an excellent fit to the @xmath2 scattering data .",
    "we argued that the use of a @xmath0 matrix gives a more reliable description of the off - shell behaviour of the effective @xmath2 interaction , the price to be paid however is the non - gauge invariance of the calculated current .",
    "we showed that after repairing gauge invariance in one of the well - known schemes , we find results that are similar to the ones obtained in models that use less sophisticated @xmath2 interactions .",
    "in particular , we verified that the dominant contribution to virtual bremsstrahlung in this energy range comes from the @xmath1-resonance decay . in detail",
    "we found significant differences : the nucleonic contribution is larger than found in models which only include on - shell @xmath2 scattering information .",
