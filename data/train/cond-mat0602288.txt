    "the overall switching probability is given by a sum of tunneling probabilities from individual intrawell states @xmath388 where @xmath389 is a prefactor that smoothly depends on @xmath37 , and @xmath390 is the imaginary part of the action of a classical particle with hamiltonian @xmath10 and energy @xmath238 , which moves in complex time from the turning point @xmath83 in one well of @xmath10 to the turning point in the other well .",
    "it follows from the analysis in appendix  a and eq .  ( [ eq : pe ] ) , that the duration of such motion is @xmath391 . therefore @xmath392 .    taking into account that @xmath393 , we see that the derivative of the overall exponent in eq .",

    "in this paper we studied switching between the states of period two vibrations of a parametrically modulated nonlinear oscillator and the distribution over period - two quasienergy levels .",
    "we considered a semiclassical case where the wells of the scaled oscillator hamiltonian in the rotating frame @xmath10 , fig .",

    "the distance between the levels is small compared to @xmath395 but much larger than the tunneling splitting .",
    "we assumed that the oscillator is underdamped , so that the interlevel distance exceeds their width . at the same time , of primary interest was the case where this width exceeds the tunneling splitting .",
    "we considered relaxation due to coupling to a thermal bath , which is linear in the oscillator coordinate , as well as dephasing from random noise that modulates the oscillator frequency .",

    "it differs significantly from the solution for @xmath1 , for a large number of intrawell states .",

    "the probability of switching between period two states @xmath47 is determined by the occupation of the states near the barrier top of the effective hamiltonian @xmath10 .",
    "we calculated the effective quantum activation energy @xmath52 which gives @xmath396 . both @xmath316 and the exponent of the tunneling probability",
    "are proportional to the reciprocal scaled planck constant @xmath397 . however , for all parameter values and all bath temperatures , @xmath316 is smaller than the tunneling exponent",
    ". therefore in the case where intrawell relaxation is faster than interwell tunneling , switching occurs via quantum activation .    in the limit where fluctuations of the oscillator are classical , @xmath398 ,",
    "we have @xmath399 , and @xmath47 is described by the standard activation law . down to small planck numbers @xmath400 the quantum activation energy @xmath52 is reasonably well described by the classical expression even for small @xmath401 provided @xmath402 is replaced by @xmath403 , with @xmath32 being the planck number of the oscillator .",
    "the inapplicability of this description for small @xmath32 indicates , however , that classical and quantum fluctuations do not simply add up .",
