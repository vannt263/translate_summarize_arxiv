    "it has received growing attentions since the first observation by the cdf collaboration  @xcite .",
    "this can be particularly witnessed by the recent lhcb measurements of the @xmath3 lifetime  @xcite , the decay widths of @xmath4 and @xmath5  @xcite , and various other decay modes  @xcite .",

    ", the @xmath12 can provide a wealth of information  @xcite , in terms of a number of observables ranging from the decay probabilities , polarizations to an angular analysis .",

    "the small branching fraction of @xmath12 can be compensated by the high luminosity at the ongoing hadron colliders and the under - design experimental facilities .",
