    "the phenomenon of intrinsic localization ( collapse to self - localized states ) due to nonlinearity in discrete systems governed by schrdinger equations is of fundamental interest in nonlinear physics @xcite , and is the subject of current active experimental research in several areas like nonlinear optics @xcite , bose - einstein condensate arrays @xcite , polaronic effects in biomolecular processes , and local ( stretching ) modes in molecules and molecular crystals ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "discrete non - linear schrdinger equations ( nls lattices for short ) provide the theoretical description of these systems , where pulse - like ( self - localized ) states are observed .    the standard discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation is the ( simplest ) discretization of the one - dimensional continuous schrdinger equation with cubic nonlinearity in the interaction term , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a complex function of time . the first term on the right takes account of the dispersion and the second of the nonlinearity , the parameter @xmath2 is the ratio between them . for the bose - einstein condensate lattices dealt with in @xcite one can think of @xmath3 as the boson condensate wavefunction in the @xmath4-th ( optical ) potential well , and @xmath2 would thus be related to the so - called @xmath5-wave scattering length @xcite .",
    "the self - focussing effect of local nonlinearity balanced by the opposite effect of the dispersive coupling makes possible the existence of localized boson states in the schrdinger representation of the condensate lattice ( gross - pitaevskii equation ) . in a localized state ( discrete breather ) of the boson lattice the profile of @xmath6 decays exponentially away from the localization center .",
    "these solutions have an internal frequency , @xmath7 , so that the discreteness is essential to avoid resonances with the phonon band and keeping localized the energy . pinned ( immobile ) localized solutions of eq .",
    "( [ dnls ] ) have been rigorously characterized @xcite and extensively studied by highly accurate numerical @xcite and analytical approximations . however ,",
    "for exact _ mobile _ discrete breathers no rigorous formal proof of existence in standard dnls is available nowadays although lot of works have studied these kind of solutions ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the translational motion of discrete breathers introduces a new time scale ( the inverse velocity ) into play , so generically a moving breather should excite resonances with the plane wave band expectra . in a hamiltonian system , these radiative losses would tend to delocalize energy and some compensating mechanism is needed in order to sustain exact stationary states of breather translational motion . to address the problem we use unbiased ( _ i.e. _ not based on ansatze on the expected functional form of the exact solution ) and precise numerical methods which allow observations of numerically exact non - integrable mobility , paving the way to further physical ( and mathematical ) insights .    in this letter ,",
    "after explaining in section [ s.model ] the basis of the numerical method ( fixed point continuation from the integrable ablowitz - ladik limit @xcite ) and its relevant technical details briefly , we will discuss the structure of the discrete nls breathers in [ s.mdb ] .",
    "they are found to be the exact superposition of a travelling exponentially localized oscillation ( the _ core _ ) , and an extended `` background '' built up of finite amplitude plane waves @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "these resonant plane waves fit well simple ( thermodynamic limit ) predictions based on discrete symmetry requirements . finally in section [ s.bckg ]",
    "we show how the resonant background is seen to be an indispensable part of the solution . in this",
    "regard we present the mechanism through which the interaction core - background compensates the variations of the core energy ( no longer an invariant of motion away from the integrable limit ) , during the translational motion .",
    "the method used here makes use of the following nls lattice , originally introduced by salerno @xcite , @xmath9   - 2 \\nu \\phi_n |\\phi_n|^2\\;. \\label{salerno}\\ ] ] this lattice , though non - integrable for @xmath10 , provides a hamiltonian interpolation between the standard dnls equation ( [ dnls ] ) , for @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and the integrable ablowitz - ladik lattice @xcite , a - l for short , when @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the a - l model is a remarkable integrable lattice possessing a family of exact moving breather solutions : @xmath15 \\exp [ { \\mbox i}(\\alpha ( n - x_0(t ) ) + \\omega(t ) ) ] , \\label{a - lbreather}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the two parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the breather frequency and velocity @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the equation ( [ salerno ] ) has the following conserved quantities , namely the hamiltonian @xmath21 and the norm",
    "@xmath22 : @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath25 . in what follows",
    "we will fix the value @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ dnls ] ) and @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ salerno ] ) , as usual .",
    "perturbative inverse scattering transform @xcite , as well as collective coordinate methods @xcite , have been used to study moving breathers of the salerno equation ( [ salerno ] ) near the integrable a - l limit ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the numerical procedure that we explain below has the advantage of being unbiased and not restricted to small values of the non - integrability parameter @xmath29 , at the expense of restricting attention to those solutions ( [ a - lbreather ] ) which are _ resonant _ , meaning that the two breather time scales are commensurate @xmath30 ( rational time scales ratio ) . a resonant ( @xmath31 ) moving breather @xmath32",
    "is numerically represented as a fixed point of the map @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the lattice translation operator @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the @xmath37-evolution map ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath39 ; explicitly @xmath40    let us briefly present the numerical method .",
    "the implicit function theorem @xcite ensures a unique continuation of a fixed point solution of @xmath41 for parameter ( @xmath29 ) variations , provided the jacobian matrix @xmath42 is invertible : with this proviso the newton method @xcite is an efficient numerical algorithm to find the uniquely continued fixed point . in other words ,",
    "continuation from a resonant a - l breather along the salerno model is possible if one restricts the jacobian matrix @xmath43 to the subspace orthogonal to its center ( null ) subspace .",
    "the center subspace turns out to be spanned by two continuous symmetries of the salerno model , namely , _ time translation _ and _ gauge _ ( uniform phase rotation ) invariances . using singular value decomposition ( svd ) techniques @xcite ,",
    "one then obtains numerically accurate continued resonant moving breathers along the salerno model until conditions for continuation cease to hold .",
    "a ( svd)-regularized newton algorithm was already used by cretegny and aubry in @xcite to refine moving breathers of klein - gordon lattices with morse potentials obtained by other means . from the methodological side what is novel here is the systematic use of it in order to obtain the family of moving schrdinger breathers of the nls lattice ( [ salerno ] ) , for different values of @xmath44 and a fine grid of frequency values @xmath45 and the nonintegrability parameter @xmath29 .",
    "let first start with a few remarks on immobile breathers ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "some nonintegrable issues , that affect mobile solutions , can be shown continuing the immobile ones along the salerno model ( @xmath14 ,  , @xmath47 ) .",
    "first we remark that the uniquely continued solution of standard dnls ( @xmath48 ) is equal to the pinned discrete breather uniquely continued from the anticontinuous limit ( @xmath49 ) @xcite .",
    "second , only inmobile breathers which are centered either at a site ( @xmath4 ) or at a bond ( @xmath50 ) persist ; this is due to the emergence of peierls - nabarro barriers away from integrability ( @xmath51 ) , a well - known result of collective variable theory @xcite .",
    "the breather centered at a site is stable while the one centered at a bond is unstable @xcite ; its energy difference is the peierls - nabarro barrier .",
    "this energy difference acts as a barrier to mobile breathers for travelling along the lattice ; the numerical computations of this barrier nicely fit with collective variable predictions .",
    "our main interest , however , focusses on mobile solutions , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath52 . how are peierls - nabarro barriers to mobility overcome by the fixed point solution ?",
    "our results show clearly that the uniquely continued @xmath31-resonant fixed point for @xmath10 is spatially asymptotic to an _ extended background _ , whose amplitude increases from zero ( at @xmath53 ) with increasing non - integrability @xmath29 , superposed to the moving ( a - l)-like core , see figure ( [ fig : solution ] ) . in order to reveal the structure of this extended background",
    ", we have to pay attention to spatially extended solutions of the salerno model .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the role of the background in the localized core mobility can be analysed as follows .",
    "as the solution is unambiguosly found to be @xmath54 , the energy @xmath21 , equation ( [ ham ] ) , of a mobile breather can be written as @xmath55+{h}[\\hat{\\phi}^{bckg}]+{h}^{int } \\label{ham_dec}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the interaction energy , _",
    "i.e. _ the crossed terms of @xmath57 and @xmath58 in the hamiltonian . in the simplest case",
    "in which the background has a single resonant plane wave , its energy is a constant of motion ( along with the total energy ) , so one obtains @xmath59}{\\partial t}= -\\frac{\\partial { h}^{int}}{\\partial t } \\label{balance}\\ ] ] _ i.e. _ the variations of the core energy along the motion are balanced by the variations in the core - background interaction energy .",
    "equation ( [ balance ] ) dictates the dynamics of any ( eventual ) effective ( collective ) variables intended to describe the mobile core in a particle - like description of the breather .",
    "one can compute the core energy variations directly from the numerical integration of a solution by substracting ( at each time step ) the background from it . in figure ( [ fig : bckg_ham].b ) we plot the evolution of the core energy as a function of the core localization center , @xmath60 , defined by using the norm @xmath22 ( equation ( [ norm ] ) ) of the salerno model ( [ salerno ] ) as @xmath61 one observes that the core has extracted the maximum energy from the interaction term when the core passes over @xmath62 ( maxima of the pn barrier ) and has given it back to the interaction term at @xmath63 ( minima of the pn barrier ) .",
    "the bigger the pn barrier , the larger the interaction term ( directly proportional to background amplitude ) is .",
    "this result illustrate the role of the resonant background on the core mobility and the interpetation of its amplitude increase with @xmath29 . _",
    "the increase of nonintegrability , and the subsequent growth of the pn barrier , demands aditional support of energy from the interaction term , which is achieved by an increase of the background amplitude_.",
    "we have used a ( svd)-regularized newton algorithm to continue mobile discrete breathers in the salerno model from the integrable ablowitz - ladik limit .",
    "our results indicate that , away from integrability , a description of these solutions based exclusively on localized ( collective ) variables is incomplete .",
    "the solutions are composed by a localized core and a linear superposition of plane waves , the background , whose amplitudes differ orders of magnitude .",
    "the background plays an important role in the translational motion of the localized core .",
    "exact mobile localization only exist over finely tuned extended states of the nonlinear lattice .",
    "mobile `` pure '' ( _ i.e. _ zero background ) localization must be regarded as very exceptional ( integrability ) .",
