    "there is considerable progress in calculations of various cross sections for deep inelastic lepton scattering in the lipatov limit ( @xmath4 and @xmath1 fixed at a large value @xcite ) . in particular",
    "a picture has been proposed @xcite which reproduces the basic features of bfkl pomeron , e.g. its regge behavior which was earlier @xcite obtained from a direct resummation of the feynman diagrams of quantum chromodynamics .",
    "subsequently , the model of @xcite was applied to calculate the total cross section , the diffractive dissociation cross section , and the corresponding structure functions for the proton target @xcite .    in view of the successful experimental program for the so - called `` small - x physics ''  which is being pursued at hera for proton targets and",
    "will be , possibly , extended to nuclear targets  it makes sense to adapt the results of @xcite also to nuclear targets .",
    "so , in this paper , we apply the results of @xcite to calculate the shadowing in deep inelastic lepton - nucleus interactions .",
    "the problem of nuclear shadowing in deep inelastic lepton - nucleus interactions has been recently discussed in many papers .",
    "@xcite give an up - to - date picture of this field .",
    "for a description and discussion of the basic physical ideas of the model used in the present calculations we refer the reader to the article @xcite . here",
    "a brief summary will suffice .",
    "the model was initially designed for `` onium '' - `` onium '' scattering , i.e. for scattering of two bound @xmath5 states with a small transverse separation . at high energy",
    " in perturbative qcd  such an `` onium '' state evolves ( cascades ) into a bunch of colorless dipoles whose number increases as a power of the incident energy .",
    "the interaction occurs _ via _ two gluon exchange between the pairs of dipoles ( one from each `` onium '' ) .",
    "navelet , peschanski , royon and wallon @xcite applied this model to deep inelastic lepton - proton scattering .",
    "they assumed  naturally  that the virtual photon at high @xmath1 can be described by an `` onium '' .",
    "for the target proton  which certainly does not resemble an `` onium ''  they made a rather bold assumption that it can nevertheless be approximated by a collection of `` onia '' with an average `` onium '' radius to be determined from the data .",
    "it was thus rather surprising that such a  seemingly crude  model described very reasonably the existing data on @xmath6 and on gluon structure function in a fairly large range of @xmath1 and of bjorken @xmath7 . to obtain good fits to the experimental data the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite had only to normalize @xmath6 .",
    "we show below that this normalization corresponds to @xmath8 `` onia '' in a nucleon .",
    "in the present paper we apply these ideas to the calculations of shadowing in deep inelastic scattering from nuclear targets .",
    "we hope that this can provide an independent check of the hypothesis of ref .",
    "@xcite , and give more information about the nucleon structure at very small bjorken @xmath7 .",
    "the total virtual transverse photon - `` onium '' cross section is one of the basic inputs in computations of nuclear shadowing and we will use the following integral representation of @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the index of the good and walker eigenmodes of absorption , see below )    @xmath11    this integral representation is our version of @xmath12 discussed in @xcite .",
    "we have checked through numerical evaluation of ( [ eq1 ] ) that it agrees well with the results of refs .",
    "@xcite provided @xmath8 . in ( [ eq1 ] ) @xmath13 is the number of colors involved in the process , and @xmath14 is an effective number of `` onia''in the nucleon .",
    "@xmath15 , @xmath16 is the sum of the squares of quark charges , and @xmath17 fm is approximately the `` onium '' diameter .",
    "@xmath18    and @xmath19 is the eigenvalue of the bfkl kernel defined in terms of @xmath20 $ ] as @xmath21 @xmath22 determines the slope of the bfkl pomeron @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a strong coupling constant",
    ".    since we are interested in the structure function @xmath25 one should add to ( [ eq1 ] ) , which gives the transverse virtual photon - `` onium '' total cross section , the contribution of the longitudinal virtual photon in order to have a complete virtual photon - `` onium '' total cross section . as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite one gets the longitudinal photon contribution by replacing the function @xmath26 of ( [ eq2 ] ) by @xmath27 : @xmath28 since the integrand in ( [ eq1 ] ) is strongly peaked at @xmath29 we can approximate the above replacement by @xmath30 .",
    "hence the total cross section is @xmath31 the success of ( [ eq1 ] ) ( compare @xcite ) encourages us to apply the results of @xcite to evaluation of nuclear shadowing .    in the next section we present the general formula for the shadow in the deep inelastic virtual photon - nucleus interactions . in section [ sec : triple ]",
    "we apply it to calculate the `` triple pomeron '' @xcite contribution to shadowing . in section [ sec : quasi ] we do the same for the `` quasielastic '' contributions @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : disc ] presents results and conclusions .",
    "two appendices give details of derivations of some formulae .",
    "many theoretical papers on this and related subjects have been published in the past and our task is merely to adapt the existing material for our purposes . our main formula , which gives the deviation from unity of the ratio , @xmath32 , of the total virtual photon - nucleus cross section to the incoherent sum of the cross sections on individual nucleons , is a slight generalization of the formula proposed more than 25 years ago by gottfried and yennie @xcite and then developed by yennie and bauer et al @xcite .",
    "it goes as follows :    @xmath33 ^ 2 \\nonumber \\\\ & &   \\times   \\ , \\rho({\\bf b},z_1 ) \\ , \\rho({\\bf b},z_2 ) \\ ,   e^{i(z_1-z_2)mx_p }   \\left[1-\\int\\limits_{z_1}^{z_2 } dz_3 \\ , \\rho({\\bf b},z_3 )   \\int d^2b ' f_n({\\bf b'})\\right]^{a-2 } \\biggr\\ } \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    negative @xmath34 means there is shadowing , positive @xmath34 - antishadowing . here",
    "@xmath35 is the bjorken variable with @xmath36 ( the negative of the four momentum squared of the virtual photon ) , @xmath37 - the nucleon mass , @xmath38 - the energy loss of the incident lepton ( in the rest frame of the target nucleus ) .",
    "@xmath39 where @xmath40 is the mass of the virtual photon excitation . in this formula",
    "we neglected the correlations between the nucleons inside the target .",
    "the index @xmath10 stands for the good and walker eigenmodes of absorption @xcite , which propagate through nuclear matter without diffractive excitations .",
    "@xmath41 is the impact parameter of the virtual photon , and @xmath42 is the probability of realization of the @xmath10-th eigenmode .",
    "@xmath43 is the total transverse virtual photon - nucleon cross section .",
    "@xmath44 is the forward scattering amplitude of the @xmath10-th mode .    in @xcite",
    "only second order interactions in dipole - dipole cross section of the diffractively excited systems were considered .",
    "then , only two classes of processes seem to be dominant @xcite : the `` triple pomeron '' contribution where the `` onium '' scatters inelastically , and the `` quasielastic''contribution where the `` onium '' scatters quasielastically from the target proton .    note that the results of refs .",
    "@xcite we are going to use to calculate ( [ eq7 ] ) do not give us @xmath42 and @xmath45 but only @xmath46 .",
    "however , @xmath47 and higher order expressions have , so far , not been calculated ( e.g. in the case of an exchange of three pomerons one would have to calculate a three dipoles distribution function ) , hence the last factor in ( [ eq7 ] ) , @xmath48^{a-2}$ ] , can , at present , be only approximated ( see below ) .",
    "note also that when the transverse spatial extension of @xmath44 is much smaller than the nuclear radius ( hence the transverse extension of @xmath49 ) we can approximate    @xmath50    this approximation was employed in ( [ eq7 ] ) .",
    "physically , this is the question of the relative transverse sizes of the cascade of dipoles @xcite and of the nucleus .",
    "we have checked accuracy of the assumption ( [ eq9 ] ) for @xmath49 suitable for large nuclei ( see section [ sec : disc ] ) and found it acceptable ; @xmath49 s are taken in form of saxon - woods distributions .",
    "now we will discuss the other input , @xmath51 , from @xcite and to make it concise we shall proceed through numerous references to many formulae of the papers of refs .",
    "we assume @xmath52 , hence a large nucleus where ( [ eq9 ] ) is applicable .",
    "we first work out only the double scattering factor in ( [ eq7 ] ) .",
    "we modify the formula ( 21 ) of @xcite introducing two impact parameters @xmath53,@xmath54 ( to describe collisions with two different nucleons ) and taking the inverse mellin transformation of both sides of ( 21 ) :    @xmath55    where @xmath56^{-1}=a(x_p)\\ , , \\label{eq11}\\ ] ] and @xmath57 denotes a partial summation over the parameters specifying diffractive eigenstates ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "the prime is added because the summation over the masses , @xmath40 , of the diffractively excited states is left till the very end .",
    "@xmath58 is a symmetric function of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and e.g. for @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 being the hypergeometric function , and @xmath64 , \\label{eq13}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the square of the proton wave function . for small",
    "@xmath66 one can evaluate ( [ eq10 ] ) analytically ( the relevant integrals are given in appendix a ) and obtain for the transverse virtual photon    @xmath67    where @xmath68 and @xmath69 is a non - perturbative parameter determined from the data .",
    "a fit to the proton structure function gives @xmath17 fm @xcite .    at this point",
    "we introduce the nuclear algorithm with @xmath70 collisions inside the nucleus .",
    "we write @xmath71 and @xmath72    the question now is what to take for @xmath73 ?",
    "as we have already remarked the results given in @xcite do not go beyond the double scattering .",
    "also , @xcite do not provide us with amplitudes for the eigenstates of absorption but with amplitudes averaged over many eigenstates . in order to have such amplitudes",
    "one would have to do new and  possibly  rather complicated calculations .",
    "therefore , in order to _ estimate _ the multiple scattering corrections we shall use the full amplitude for dipole - proton scattering at fixed @xmath74 ( this is the diameter of the `` onium '' representing the virtual photon )    @xmath75    where @xcite @xmath76 the integration over @xmath77 can be done ( see appendix a ) and we obtain @xmath78    a comment is here in order . to estimate the multiple scattering corrections one can use some other than @xmath73 effective amplitude , e.g. the one proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite eq .",
    "( 5 ) . in our notation",
    "it amounts to taking the ratio @xmath79 instead of @xmath73 . as expected , @xmath80 but both are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "since the complete expressions for multiple scattering corrections need direct calculations of the contributions of interactions with 3 and more nucleons which are not done , we choose @xmath73 as a somewhat simpler expression .",
    "the last point is to average @xmath81 over the _ probability _ , @xmath82 , to find a dipole in the virtual transverse or longitudinal photon @xcite :    [ eq21 ]    @xmath83    @xmath84    here @xmath85 thus the `` triple pomeron''(tp ) transverse ( t ) and longitudinal ( l ) contributions to the shadow , within the approximation ( [ eq9 ] ) , is as follows    @xmath86^{a-2}\\biggr\\ }    \\,\\,\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq23}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for comments on the limits of the integration over @xmath87 and @xmath74 see section [ sec : disc ] .",
    "it is convenient to extract from ( [ eq23 ] ) a correction factor , @xmath88 , for multiple interactions higher than double .",
    "this is the factor which multiplies the double scattering contribution to give @xmath89 .",
    "thus we have    @xmath90    @xmath88 will be used in the next section to compute the shadow of the whole multiple scattering process from the shadow of the double scattering contribution .",
    "we believe that the level of accuracy of our calculations and the size of @xmath88 justify this approximation .",
    "this time the ref .",
    "@xcite provides us with the basic formulae and we will assume @xmath91 hence , again , we accept the approximation ( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "the method used in @xcite to obtain the double scattering contribution is different than in the case of `` triple pomeron '' @xcite and we now have at our disposal the probability _ amplitude _ for the intermediate state which , in the present case , is the one dipole state .",
    "therefore , the procedure of integration over @xmath92 is done at the level of the amplitude which , subsequently , is contracted with the probability amplitude for finding a dipole in a photon of a given polarization , and the result squared .",
    "so , starting from the formulae ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , we first replace @xmath93 by @xmath94 , do the integration of the amplitude @xmath95 over @xmath92 , and obtain the following double scattering terms in the approximation ( [ eq9 ] ) :    [ eq25 ] @xmath96   \\left [ \\int^{r_0}_0",
    "d\\rho\\rho f_{eff}(r_0,\\rho , x_p ) k_1(\\hat q\\rho)j_1(\\hat m\\rho)\\right]^2 \\nonumber",

    "therefore , since the basic ingredient of @xmath88 defined in section [ sec : triple ] is the factor ( defined through the same amplitude @xmath73 as in ( [ eq25 ] ) ) , we accept that by multiplying @xmath100 for just the double interaction inside the target nucleus by @xmath101 we obtain a reasonable approximation for @xmath100 with all possible ( i.e. @xmath70 ) interactions included .",
    "the error made in this approximate procedure is not significant because @xmath101 is close to unity throughout the relevant region of @xmath7 and @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) .    following steps similar to those which led us to the formula ( [ eq23 ] ) we obtain for the quasielastic contributions to the shadow of the transverse and longitudinal virtual photons",
    "the following expressions :    [ eq26 ] @xmath102",
    "\\left[\\int^{r_0}_0d\\rho\\rho f_{eff}(r_0,\\rho , x_p ) k_1(\\hat q\\rho)j_1(\\hat m\\rho)\\right]^2\\biggr\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{eq26a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath103 ^ 2\\biggr\\}\\ , , \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{eq26b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath98 is given by ( [ eq20 ] ) .",
    "clearly , setting @xmath104 reduces both ( [ eq24 ] ) and ( [ eq26 ] ) to the correct expressions for the double scattering contributions to the shadow .",
    "in fact  as we have already stressed  the double scattering term is more reliable than the multiple scattering correction because its input from @xcite comes exclusively from the `` first principles '' .",
    "that is why it is of interest to discuss deuterium target .",
    "this will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "before presenting any results a comment on the real parts of the amplitudes @xmath105 is in order .",
    "first , the dependence of @xmath106 on @xmath7 , hence on @xmath107 implies that @xmath108 $ ] must be different from zero .",
    "this follows from the derivative analyticity relations for the forward elastic hadronic amplitudes worked out in e.g. ref .",
    "we can introduce , approximately , this effect into all our expressions derived so far performing the following replacements :            now the results .",
    "we have calculated all contributions to the shadow @xmath34 from the triple pomeron and the quasielastic diffractions for two target nuclei : lead ( pb , a=208 ) and calcium ( ca , a=40 ) .",
    "all integrations in ( [ eq23 ] ) and ( [ eq26 ] ) were done numerically with an extensive help of _ mathematica _ ( more details are given in appendix b ) .",
    "we assumed @xmath121 which , through relation ( [ eq4 ] ) and using @xmath122 gives the strong coupling constant @xmath123 this is an acceptable set of parameters characterizing the bfkl pomeron .",
    "we set @xmath124 to recover the fit to the experimental data of the @xmath6 of the nucleon @xcite .",
    "[ 31 ] @xmath126 which , as seen from ( [ eq7 ] ) , amounts to excluding distances @xmath127 from the double- and higher multiplicity interactions ; physically a reasonable condition to impose .",
    "this was done because in construction of the triple pomeron contribution to @xmath34 , eq .",
    "( [ eq23 ] ) , see also appendix a , we explicitly used the approximation of small @xmath66 , hence small @xmath125 .",
    "we have checked that changing the upper limit for @xmath125 ( [ eq31a ] ) by a factor @xmath128 or @xmath129 does not change significantly @xmath130 , at the values of @xmath7 for which we have done the calculations , namely @xmath131 .",
    "this gives the lower limit for integration over @xmath87 : @xmath132 .",
    "the upper limit for @xmath87 on the other hand , should be taken close to unity because small masses give important contributions to shadowing .",
    "so , the integration range for @xmath87 is taken as @xmath133    all this makes almost all _ asymptotic _ formulae for the `` triple pomeron '' given in refs .",
    "@xcite inacceptable for our purposes because they lead to infinities for integrations over @xmath87 s close to unity .",
    "we wish to make it clear : by extending our calculation to @xmath87 close to @xmath134 , hence to very small masses @xmath40 , we go beyond the region of @xmath87 s for which the original formulation of refs .",
    "@xcite was devised .",
    "we make this extrapolation because _ the complete integral representations _ _ of various _",
    "@xmath51_given also in _",
    "@xcite _ lead to well _ _ defined finite results , even for _ @xmath135 and only they are employed in our calculations .",
    "the price to pay is loss of simple analytic expressions and necessity of numerical integrations .",
    "although the asymptotic form of @xmath136 does not lead to any such problems , to be consistent with our treatment of @xmath51 , we also used its integral representation ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "we set the cutoff parameter , @xmath137 , of the integration over @xmath74 , following the discussion of ref .",
    "@xcite , at @xmath138 .",
    "unfortunately , in the case of nuclear targets the saturation of the values of the integrals over @xmath74 does not look as good as in the case of the nucleon target ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , fig .",
    "2 ) . therefore , we should treat @xmath137 as a parameter with the lower bound equal @xmath139 .",
    "this implies that taking @xmath140 we tend to underestimate the shadow .",
    "one more general comment : we accept that the contribution to @xmath34 of the triple pomeron - , of the quasielastic transverse - , and of the quasielastic longitudinal processes are additive . in other words",
    "we do not introduce any interferences between them .    in fig .",
    "1 a , b the total shadow @xmath141 is presented for pb and ca targets . as we can see , the pattern of all curves for these two targets is very similar , only the size of the shadow for pb is a factor of two larger than for ca .",
    "we have also checked through explicit calculations that all components of @xmath34 of pb are by the same factor @xmath142 larger than of ca .",
    "therefore , we will , henceforth , show only the results for pb .    in fig .",
    "2 a , b we show @xmath130 with ( a ) and without ( b ) presence of the real part of the forward scattering amplitudes . comparing this figure with fig .",
    "1 we see that @xmath130 dominates @xmath34 , and that the presence of @xmath143 makes shadowing smaller .",
    "in fact a different from zero real part makes @xmath144 smaller : by 16% at very small @xmath7 and by 60% ( ! ) at @xmath145 .",
    "( the role of the real parts of the forward amplitudes at various @xmath7 has been recently discussed in @xcite . )    in fig .",
    "3 a , b we show the correction factor for multiple scattering higher than double , @xmath88 , with ( a ) and without ( b ) presence of @xmath110 .",
    "we can see that in either case @xmath101 is close enough to unity to justify our procedures in construction of @xmath34 .",
    "\\(a ) the rather weak @xmath1 dependence of @xmath34 seems puzzling if one takes into account that in the dipole model the total ( virtual ) photon - hadron cross section decreases as @xmath152 at large @xmath153 @xcite .",
    "one would thus naively expect @xmath154 to decrease also as @xmath152 which is another version of the bjorken - gribov @xcite paradox . in the dipole model",
    "the paradox is resolved ( and approximate scaling of @xmath34 recovered ) due to the cascade nature of the intermediate state which interacts inside the nucleus .",
    "this cascade nature implies very strong correlations between the dipoles in the onium representing the virtual photon so that the double dipole density does not resemble at all the product of single densities and both @xmath155 and @xmath156 behave as @xmath152 ( apart from logarithmic corrections ) .",
    "the approximate scaling of @xmath34 follows .",
    "it is interesting to observe that this explanation is radically different from that proposed in the parton model ( first paper of @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "\\(b ) it should be pointed out that , although our calculation is based on perturbative qcd ( as is the whole dipole approach ) , it nevertheless requires two `` non - perturbative '' parameters ( @xmath139 and @xmath14 ) describing structure of the nucleon .",
    "these parameters were estimated from the data on the total ( virtual ) photon - proton cross section as they can not be calculated in the dipole model . particularly important for the absolute value of the shadowing turns out to be @xmath14 , the average number of `` onia '' forming the proton .",
    "this confirms the point of view that the perturbative qcd alone can not describe fully deep inelastic scattering even at very small @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "it is rather remarkable , however , that the required `` non - perturbative '' input is so restricted .",
    "\\(c ) as was already pointed out in the main text , our calculation relies heavily on the calculation of the deep inelastic diffraction reported in @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of close relation between the nuclear shadowing and diffraction ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth to mention that  due to the power - law tail in the impact parameter dependence of the quasielastic and triple pomeron amplitudes  nuclear shadowing is much more sensitive to the details of the effective cut - off in the photon - nucleon impact parameter plane than is the total diffractive cross section . at this point",
    "the two calculations are substantially different .",
    "\\(d ) our treatment of multiple scattering is only approximate . to improve on this point , it is necesarry to calculate directly at least the contribution of interaction with 3 nucleons which would give an estimate of the accuracy of our approximation .",
    "this seems a feasible , although probably a complicated calculation .",
    "this work was supported in part by the kbn grant no 2 p03b 083 08 ( a.b . and w.c .",
    ") , by the stiftung fur deutsch - polnische zusammenarbeit project 1522/94/ln ( w.f . ) , and by peco grant from the eec programme `` human capital mobility '' , network `` physics at high energy colliders '' ( contract nr : erbicipdct 940613 ) .",
    "one of the authors ( w.c . )",
    "thanks institute of nuclear physics in krakw for financial support .",
    "let us denote @xmath167 of course @xmath168 depends on @xmath169 .",
    "but , in the limit @xmath170 , the main contribution to the integral ( [ eqa4 ] ) comes from the region @xmath171 and we approximate @xmath168 by @xmath172 . using this we obtain from ( [ eqa4 ] )              next point is the integration over @xmath177 .",
    "this we do as in @xcite ( although the accuracy of this procedure may be not very good ) .",
    "let us repeat the steps .",
    "since the integrand is symmetric in @xmath178 we have                for a fixed value of bjorkens @xmath7 , the contour integral in ( [ eq14 ] ) becomes a function of two variables : @xmath74 and @xmath87 .",
    "such a two - dimensional function was tabulated ( for @xmath186,@xmath187 , @xmath188 and @xmath189 ) and used as an input in the fortran program calculating the triple pomeron contribution ( [ eq23 ] ) .",
