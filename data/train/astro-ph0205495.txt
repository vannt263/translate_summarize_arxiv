    "the _ hipparcos _ satellite mission yielded parallax measurements for hundreds of nearby red clump stars , and these are , collectively , the best calibrated standard candle ( paczyski & stanek 1998 ; paczyski  2001 ) .",

    "they find a population correction in the @xmath0-band of 0.2  mag .",
    "consequently , they revise the udalski ( 2000 ) result to @xmath11 , and the zaritsky ( 1999 ) and romaniello et al .",

    "alves  ( 2000 ) demonstrated the use of the red clump as a standard candle at longer wavelengths ; he calibrated the _",
    "red clump absolute magnitude in the @xmath1-band , and applied the calibration to the galactic bulge red clump .",
    "one advantage of working in this @xmath132@xmath14 passband is the particularly small effect of extinction by interstellar dust ( e.g.  schlegel et al .",
    "grocholski and sarajedini ( 2002 ) recently studied population effects on the red clump s @xmath1-band absolute magnitude by compiling 2mass photometry of open clusters .",
    "they concluded that @xmath15 is , in general , also less sensitive to population effects than @xmath16 .",
    "the red clump models of girardi and salaris ( 2001 ) were also shown to be in fair agreement with the @xmath1-band open cluster data . in this _ letter _ , we present a deep @xmath1-band luminosity function for red clump stars in the lmc bar and inner - disk .",
    "we also construct a @xmath1 , @xmath3 color - magnitude diagram , and complementary @xmath2 and @xmath0 luminosity functions .",
    "this is a first reconnaissance of optical and near - infrared photometry of the lmc red clump .",
    "the 6 lines - of - sight studied in this paper are centered on the source stars of lmc microlensing events discovered by the macho project ( alcock et al .",
    "2001 ; events 4 , 7 , 9 , 12 , 14 , and 18 ) . for our purposes ,",
    "the lines - of - sight were selected at random by the natural occurrence of microlensing .",
    "the 6-field average line - of - sight intersects the lmc disk at @xmath17 = 05:25:55.2 and @xmath18 = @xmath1970:20:24  ( j2000 ) .",
    "this is @xmath20 from the center of the lmc , nearly perpendicular to the line - of - nodes , and on the far side of the inclined disk ( van  der  marel et al .",
    "the geometric correction is small , about 0.6% in distance ( 0.013 mag ) , and in the sense that our clump giants are farther away than those at the lmc center .",
    "the @xmath1-band dataset analyzed here was obtained with the sofi infrared imager at the european southern observatory s new technology telescope ; it is a 1024@xmath211024 array with a pixel size of 0@xmath22.292 .",
    "the total field - of - view of our trimmed ( equal - exposure ) images after coadding individual dithered frames is about 140 @xmath23 .",
    "the photometry was derived with daophot ii ( stetson 1994 ) , and calibrated with observations of 6 standard stars ( persson et al .",
    "conditions were photometric ( rejkuba et al",
    ".  2001 ) .",
    "the 1-@xmath24 standard deviation of the calibration solution is 0.028  mag . over 98% of the stars in the red clump ( or brighter ; @xmath25 ) were detected with a signal - to - noise @xmath26 10 , and thus our sofi red clump data are nearly complete .",
    "the @xmath27 mag system employed ( `` k - short '' ) is the same as 2mass . in order to check our standardized zero point",
    ", we matched a subset of the sofi data with 2mass second incremental release photometry .",
    "a comparison shows no zero - point difference to within 0.02  mag ( for stars with colors like the red clump ) .",
    "however , all of the stars in the comparison are actually redder and brighter than the clump , and thus the agreement found lends only weak support to the accuracy of our data .",
    "finally , @xmath27  magnitudes are related to the @xmath1-band red clump data compiled by alves ( 2000 ) by @xmath28 ( grocholski & sarajedini 2002 ; their eqn .  2 ) .",
    "we transform @xmath27 to @xmath1 accordingly .",

    "we exclude the pc2 images from our analysis .",
    "this guarantees a homogeneous @xmath2 and @xmath0 photometry dataset , and represents only a small loss in imaged area .",
    "the 3 wfs are 800@xmath21800 pixel arrays with a pixel size of 0@xmath22.1 .",
    "the resulting total field - of - view is approximately 32  @xmath23 .",

    "nearly all of the lmc clump giants were detected with very high signal - to - noise . in order to check our @xmath2 and @xmath0 zero points , we cross - correlated a subset of our data with ogle  ii ground - based photometry ( udalski et al .",
    "a comparison reveals zero - point differences of @xmath29 and @xmath30  mag in the sense that ogle  ii is brighter .",
    "alcock et al .  ( 1999 ) compared macho ground - based photometry with an early reduction of these same standardized _",
    "hst_/wf data ( a different subset ) , and found that macho was brighter by @xmath31 and @xmath32 mag . we speculate that the aperture corrections applied to the ogle  ii and macho ground - based @xmath2 data may be affected at the 5 - 10% level by crowding errors .",
    "for example , it is possible that the @xmath2-band `` sky '' around bright stars used to determine the aperture corrections was on average underestimated because nearby neighbor stars were oversubtracted ( alcock et al .  1999 ; udalski et al .",
    "we tentatively adopt a formal systematic calibration error of 0.02  mag in @xmath2 and @xmath0 based on the stated accuracy of _",
    "hst_/wf calibrations .",
    "we detected approximately 36,000 stars in @xmath1 and 109,000 stars in @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "of these approximately 27,000 have @xmath33 , and 7,000 have @xmath34 .",
    "cross - correlating these latter source lists yields 4745 stars with @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and @xmath2 mags .",

    "the first - ascent red giant branch ( rgb ) is identified as the roughly vertical sequence running from @xmath35 2.2 at @xmath36 to @xmath35 3.1 at @xmath37 .",
    "it has a width of about 0.2 mag in @xmath3 color , and no distinct component branches are evident",
    ". some of these stars are second - ascent asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "the distinction between an rgb and agb star is not necessarily clear in a cmd of mixed - age field populations like this one .",
    "the sought - after horizontal branch red clump is the most prominent feature in fig .",
    "1 . it appears at @xmath38 and lies mostly blueward of the giant branch , i.e.  @xmath39 .",
    "the detailed structure of the clump seen here is well understood in the context of stellar evolution theory ( girardi & salaris 2001 ) .",
    "the overdensity of stars with @xmath38 and colors that associate them with the giant branch ( i.e.  @xmath40 to 2.5 ) may be the first detection of the `` rgb bump '' for lmc field stars ( see fig .",
    "19 of girardi & salaris 2001 ) .",
    "the rgb bump is an evolutionary pause as the hydrogen - burning shell crosses a chemical composition discontinuity .",
    "the loose clustering of stars seen on the giant branch at @xmath41 and @xmath42 may be the `` agb bump , '' an evolutionary pause at the onset of helium shell burning ( e.g. , see alves & sarajedini 1999 ) .",

    "clump is shown on the right ( data from alves  2000 ) .",
    "the lfs in @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and @xmath2 are each plotted in separate panels ( top to bottom ) .",
    "lmc bin size is 0.05 mag ; _ hipparcos _ bin size is 0.10 mag ; each panel is 1.5  mag wide .",
    "the adopted model lfs ( solid lines in fig .  2 ) are a superposition of a linear background and a gaussian of variable width , amplitude , and location .",
    "the backgrounds are fit in restricted magnitude ranges which exclude the clump . the best - fit model parameters and @xmath43 ( per d.o.f . )",
    "are provided in table  1 . the lmc red clump in fig",
    ".  2 totals about 2000 stars . for comparison ,",
    "there are 238 _ hipparcos _ red clump stars with @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and @xmath2 data ( alves 2000 ) .",
    "this distinction reflects in the formal statistical errors for the peak clump brightnesses given in table  1 . despite the shortcomings of our model lfs revealed in fig .  2 ,",
    "the peak brightnesses of the red clumps are evidently well determined .",
    "the _ hipparcos _ calibration assumes no reddening correction , as suggested by stanek and garnavich ( 1998 ) .",
    "these authors argue that the average reddening is probably @xmath44  mag .",
    "it should be kept in mind that the lmc distance derived in this work is practically independent of the reddening correction applied to the _ hipparcos _ clump .",
    "however , the average lmc reddening obtained in comparison may be slightly underestimated .",
    "we note that the lutz - kelker correction to the alves ( 2000 ) calibration dataset is probably also negligible ( udalski 2000 ) .",
    "the true lmc distance modulus is therefore given by : @xmath45 where @xmath46 corresponds to either @xmath1 , @xmath0 , or @xmath2 , and the apparent distance moduli in each passband are @xmath47 .",
    "the corrections for population effects are @xmath48(lmc ) following the convention of girardi and salaris  ( 2001 ) .",
    "these corrections , the inverse effective wavelengths of each passband ( @xmath49 ) , and the adopted reddening law ( @xmath50 ; schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) are all summarized in table  1 .",
    "the results of this work are insensitive to small uncertainties in the reddening law or effective wavelengths employed . although omitted from eqn .  1",
    ", we also apply a geometric correction to our final distance estimate ( see below ) .",
    "we first compare the lmc and _ hipparcos _ red clumps by assuming @xmath51 = 0 .",
    "the resulting apparent distance moduli are plotted as a function of inverse effective wavelength in figure  3 ( open circles ; error bars omitted ) , and listed in table  1 .",
    "a fit for the average interstellar reddening and true lmc distance modulus yields @xmath52 = @xmath53 @xmath54 and @xmath55 = 18.562 @xmath56 , which is shown as the dotted line in fig .  2 .",
    "a negative reddening correction is unphysical , and indicates a significant population difference between the lmc and _ hipparcos _ red clumps . in order to account for the population difference",
    ", we appeal to the theoretical calculations of girardi and salaris ( 2001 ) .",
    "these authors generated artificial lmc and _ hipparcos _ red clumps from a grid of core helium - burning stellar models .",
    "each clump refers to specific star formation and chemical enrichment histories reported in the literature , and is thus constrained at least indirectly by observational data .",
    "possible systematic errors associated with the zero - points of the theoretical models would cancel in the first order approximation , because the population corrections are calculated only in a relative sense .",
    "this calculation predicts @xmath57  mag (  1 ) . in a private communication ( l.  girardi & m.  salaris  2002 ) , the same artificial clumps yield population corrections of @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( table  1 ) .",
    "the @xmath1-band absolute magnitude has the smallest correction , in agreement with the trend noted by grocholski and sarajedini ( 2002 ) .",
    "the resulting modified apparent distance moduli are plotted in fig .",
    "3 ( solid circles with error bars ) , and listed in table  1 . solving for the reddening and true distance modulus yields @xmath52 = 0.089 @xmath60 and @xmath55 = 18.506 @xmath56 ( solid line in fig .  3 ) .",
    "the excellent fit of the red clump data in fig .",
    "3 lends indirect support to the photometric zero - points adopted in this work . applying a small correction for the inclination of the lmc disk and the location of our fields (  2 ) ,",
    "the true lmc distance modulus is @xmath55 = 18.493 @xmath56 .",
    "we have presented new multi - wavelength luminosity functions of lmc red clump stars .",
    "our analysis yields a distance modulus of @xmath61 .",
    "the @xmath1-band red clump distance to the lmc is 49.96 @xmath62 0.77 kpc in good agreement with the average published value ( 50.1 kpc ; freedman et al .",
    "we have also derived an average reddening of @xmath52 = 0.089 @xmath60 . for comparison ,",
    "the galactic foreground reddening in this direction is @xmath63 ( oestreicher et al .",
    "our mean reddening result is consistent with the foreground reddening , and this is a success of the girardi and salaris ( 2001 ) models .    the statistical error associated with our new distance result is due to the _ hipparcos _ calibration ( 3% ) , and measuring the lmc red clump brightnesses ( 1% ) . the overall systematic error may be comparable .",
    "our photometry is standardized with a 2% systematic uncertainty .",
    "this error is also uncorrelated between @xmath1 and @xmath2 or @xmath0 .",
    "however , our zero - point checks do not support this level of photometric accuracy unless ground - based comparison data are in some cases too bright by up to 0.1 mag .",
    "we have suggested that this may be possible .",
    "uncertainties in our reddening and geometric corrections contribute negligible systematic error to the distance result .",
    "the systematic error due to the population correction is probably also small .",
    "the worst case of making no correction at all leads to a change in modulus of less than 6% .",
    "however , this also yields a negative reddening correction . for realistic reddenings ,",
    "the population correction to the true distance modulus is approximately the same as the correction in the @xmath1-band ( 3% ) . in summary ,",
    "the systematic errors in our @xmath1-band red clump distance to the lmc are probably of order 2% ( photometric calibration ) and 3% ( population correction ) , and thus comparable to the statistical error obtained .",
    "the @xmath1-band red clump distance to the lmc is in agreement with previously reported @xmath0-band results (  1 ) .",
    "the only serious discrepancy is the short distance result of udalski ( 2000 ) based on ogle  ii data .",
    "udalski ( 2000 ) finds a mean dereddened red clump brightness of @xmath64 for 9 fields in the lmc halo .",
    "those fields are on average @xmath65 from the center of the lmc , nearly perpendicular to the line - of - nodes , and on the _ near _ side of the inclined disk ( van  der  marel et al .",

    ", the udalski ( 2000 ) red clump brightness becomes @xmath66 mag ( at lmc center ) . for comparison ,",
    "our dereddened red clump brightness ( table  1 ) corrected to the lmc center is @xmath67 mag .",
    "the results of this work , udalski ( 2000 ) , and romaniello et al .",
