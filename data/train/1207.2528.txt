    "in recent years , great progress has been made in hadronic mass spectra .",
    "there are many new states that have been observed , e.g. , the new particles @xmath13 @xcite , @xmath14 , @xmath15 @xcite , @xmath16 @xcite , @xmath17 @xcite , @xmath18 @xcite , @xmath19 @xcite , @xmath20 @xcite and @xmath21 @xcite . some of these new states are @xmath22-wave ( @xmath23 ) state candidates , such as @xmath13 , and some of them are first radial excited 2@xmath24 ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) state candidates , e.g. , @xmath14 and @xmath16 .",
    "recently , other new 2@xmath24 state candidates @xmath12 and @xmath27 are observed in inclusive @xmath28 collisions near @xmath29 gev @xcite .    besides the progress in experiment ,",
    "there are many approaches to study the heavy excited states in theory , e.g. , the authors of @xcite considered @xmath30 decays to excited @xmath31 and @xmath32 charmonium states with the relativistic quark model ; the authors of @xcite calculated the decay of @xmath33 where @xmath34 was an excited charmonium state with the light - cone qcd sum rules approach ; the authors of @xcite used generalized factorization together with @xmath35 symmetry to predict the branching ratios of @xmath36 where @xmath37 was a charmonium state and @xmath38 was a light scalar ; using the isgw2 quark model , and the authors of @xcite studied @xmath39 decays , where @xmath34 was a radial excited charmonium @xmath40 or @xmath41 .",
    "although several papers considered the topics of radial excited @xmath5 states @xcite , there is still lack of theoretical investigation for the radial excited states @xmath0 or @xmath2 , where @xmath42 is a light quark .",
    "one may also note that there is no other heavy - light 2@xmath24 state , which has ever been confirmed by the experiment except charmonium and bottomonium , this means we have little knowledge about heavy - light @xmath5 states , so the study of heavy - light @xmath5 states will enlarge our knowledge of bound states and qcd .",
    "there are many methods to detect the heavy - light 2@xmath24 states experimentally .",
    "for example , by analyzing the inclusive productions of @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 systems , the babar collaboration found new mesons like @xmath12 and @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "since there are a large number of @xmath46 data in two b - factories , and the lhc will produce large data of @xmath47 and @xmath30 , there will be a best and convenient way to detect heavy - light 2@xmath24 states by @xmath3 exclusive decays . in theory ,",
    "the properties of the mesons were studied by many approaches together with the dyson - schwinger(ds ) equation of qcd or the bethe - salpeter(bs ) equation or both of them @xcite . in this paper , we will study the productions of heavy - light 2@xmath24 states in exclusive semi - leptonic decays of @xmath3 mesons by the instantaneous approximate bs method @xcite .    knowing mass and life time ( or full width ) is helpful to detect the resonance experimentally . in a previous letter @xcite , we have studied mass and strong decay of some @xmath0 and @xmath2 states by the bs method . unfortunately , there are large mass and width discrepancies between our predicted result of @xmath48 and that of @xmath12 , which is the candidate of @xmath48 in the experiment @xcite .",
    "our predicted mass is @xmath49 gev of @xmath48 @xcite , while babar s result is @xmath50 mev of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the total strong decay width of our calculation is @xmath51 mev ( note that we missed a parameter @xmath52 in all the strong decays whose final state involve @xmath53 ) , which is much smaller than the experimental value @xmath54 mev .",
    "there are several theoretical approaches to study the strong decays of this new state @xcite .",
    "we show the theoretical estimated full decay widths and the experimental data in table  [ d2550 ] .",
    "one can see that there are large discrepancies between experimental and theoretical results except the result of @xcite .",
    "[ [ product - of - semi - leptonic - decay - ratio - and - cascaded - strong - decay - ratio ] ] product of semi - leptonic decay ratio and cascaded strong decay ratio ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    we have calculated @xmath3 semi - leptonic decay to @xmath2 and @xmath0 , where all the states are on mass shells ; we also calculated the main strong decays of @xmath2 and @xmath0 , e.g. , we obtain the branching ratio of the semi - leptonic decay @xmath55 , the strong decay branching ratio @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "to reduce the influence of the discrepancies caused by the theoretical strong decay widths , and the ground @xmath58 states @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and their decays that are well known in the experiment , we multiply the branching ratio of the semi - leptonic decay with the strong decay branching ratio , which show the ability of experiment to detect the missing @xmath5 states , but we ignore the reconstructed efficiencies of events in experiment , and the products of ratios are @xmath61\\times10^{-4},\\nonumber\\\\ & & br(b^+\\to\\bar d^0(2s)\\ell^+{\\nu_\\ell})\\times br(\\bar d^0(2s)\\to \\bar d^{*0}\\pi^0)\\approx[1.7\\pm1.4(1.6\\pm1.0)]\\times10^{-4},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath62\\times10^{-4},\\nonumber\\\\ br(b^0\\to d^-(2s)\\ell^+{\\nu_\\ell})\\times br(d^-(2s)\\to   d^{*-}\\pi^0)\\approx[1.4\\pm1.1(1.5\\pm0.9)]\\times10^{-4},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath63\\times10^{-4},\\nonumber\\\\ br(b_s^0\\to d_s^-(2s)\\ell^+{\\nu_\\ell})\\times br(d_s^-(2s)\\to d^{*-}\\bar k^0)\\approx [ 4.8\\pm7.3(4.7\\pm7.1)]\\times10^{-4},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath64\\times10^{-6},\\nonumber\\\\ br(b_c^+\\to b^0(2s)\\ell^+{\\nu_\\ell})\\times br(b^0(2s)\\to b^{*0}\\pi^0 ) \\approx[0.39\\pm0.23(0.40\\pm0.22)]\\times10^{-6},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath65\\times10^{-6},\\nonumber\\\\ br(b_c^+\\to b_s^0(2s)\\ell^+{\\nu_\\ell})\\times br(b_s(2s)\\to b^{*0 } \\bar k^0)\\approx[1.8\\pm1.5(1.8\\pm1.4)]\\times10^{-6}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the decays of @xmath66 and @xmath67 have ratios of order @xmath6 , which can be analyzed with current data at b - factories .",
    "the decay of @xmath47 that has ratios of order @xmath6 may be observed in the future , while the @xmath30 decay ratio of order @xmath68 is hard to reach experimentally .    in summary",
    ", we have studied the productions of @xmath0 and @xmath2 in the exclusive semi - leptonic @xmath3 decays and the strong decays of @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "some of these decays have the branching ratios of order @xmath6 , which could be measured currently in experiments . for examples , the ratios @xmath69\\times10^{-4}$ ] and @xmath70\\times10^{-4}$ ] are relatively large in @xmath46 decays , which could be detected by the two current @xmath46-factories . for @xmath9 , the ratio @xmath71\\times10^{-4}$ ]",
    "is also not small , which will be reached in the future .",
    "we have also given the strong coupling constants of @xmath0 and @xmath2 , which maybe observed experimentally .",
    "although similar to other models results , our calculation also gave a smaller full decay width than the experimental data , but the recent detected @xmath12 is very likely the @xmath11 state .",
