    "recent high - resolution imaging , from space and from the ground , shows hitherto - unsuspected small - scale structures at the centers of many galaxies . in a number of barred galaxies ,",
    "isophotal twists have been seen within the central few hundred parsecs .",
    "small central bars , and occasional triply barred systems , are found : see friedli ( 1996 ) for a review .",
    "the inner bars appear to be oriented randomly with respect to the larger bars ( buta & crocker 1993 ) , as expected if they are dynamically distinct subsystems .",
    "high - resolution co maps of some disk galaxies show inner bars of molecular gas ( devereux 1992 , benedict 1996 ) , but the presence of inner bars in infrared images ( see friedli 1996 ; jungwiert , combes & axon 1997 ; mulchaey , regan & kundu 1997 ) suggests they contain old stars , and do not consist purely of young stars and gas . a high frequency of double bars is seen in a multicolor imaging survey of early - type barred galaxies recently completed by erwin & sparke ( 1999 ) .",
    "the survey , performed with the wiyn telescope , and supplemented with archival hst images , covers a reasonably complete sample of 38 nearby ( @xmath02000 km / s ) , bright , barred s0 and sa galaxies in the field .",
    "at least @xmath120% of these galaxies appear to possess secondary bars . in this paper",
    ", we will call the larger bar the _ big , main , primary _ or _ outer _ bar .",
    "the smaller bar will be referred to as the _ small , secondary _ or _",
    "inner _ bar . like friedli ( 1996 ) , we prefer to avoid the term ` nuclear bar ' , since a small bar on scales of tens or hundreds of parsecs can exist even in the absence of a main kiloparsec - scale bar .    within about 100 pc of a galactic center , orbital times are at least an order of magnitude less than those at a few kiloparsecs",
    "; thus a dynamically decoupled inner bar is likely to rotate faster than the outer structure . _",
    "the entire pattern is then not steady in any reference frame .",
    "_ such decoupled secondary bars have been seen to form in numerical simulations involving gravitating particles together with dissipative ` gas clouds ' ( friedli & martinet 1993 , heller & shlosman 1994 , combes 1994 , shaw 1995 )",
    ". the only systematic study of the orbital dynamics in a double - bar is that of pfenniger & norman ( 1990 ) ; they explored a weakly dissipative form of the equations of motion for a particle in one double - bar potential , finding a limit cycle in the plane of the bars , and spheroidal strange attractors .",
    "orbits in the doubly barred potential do not have a conserved integral of motion , and in principle they might all be chaotic , exploring large regions of phase space . if the orbits are mostly chaotic , it is unlikely that such a system could be _ self - consistent _ , so that the average density of all the stars on their orbits in the time - varying potential adds up exactly to what is needed to give rise to the potential in which they move .    how can potentials including two independently rotating bars maintain themselves as gravitating systems ?",
    "what are the conditions under which a gravitationally self - consistent double - bar structure could exist ? we approach these questions by considering particle orbits in models that include two rigid bars rotating at two constant , incommensurable pattern speeds . such models can not be fully self - consistent ; louis & gerhard ( 1988 ) have shown that two bars which make up a self - consistent system must distort slightly as they rotate through each other .",
    "nevertheless , we are looking for density distributions that are most likely to be close to a self - consistent model , i.e. for those which support orbital families capable of hosting sets of particles that together recreate the assumed time - dependent density distribution . in our investigation",
    "we use the concept of the _ loop",
    "_ introduced by maciejewski & sparke ( 1997 ) .",
    "we explore constraints on double - bars that could maintain a likely self - consistent structure .",
    "the concept of the loop is presented in  2 . in  3 , we review the methods that we used to find and to follow loops numerically in a doubly barred potential . in  4 , we describe our models for the density distribution in doubly barred galaxies , constructed on the basis of parameters derived from observations .",
    "various examples of loop families are given in  5 . in ",
    "6 , we closely examine loops supporting a likely self - consistent model of a double bar .",
    "limitations imposed by orbital structure on self - consistent doubly barred systems , and their implications for gas flows , are discussed in  7 .",
    "we summarize our results in  8 .",
    "analytical techniques that allow us to approximate the loops supporting a doubly barred density distribution , and to model the gas streamlines , are presented in appendix a. in appendix b , we derive the formulae for a potential of a prolate ferrers bar .",
    "a gravitational potential consisting of two concentric bisymmetric bars that are independently rotating is not stationary in any reference frame .",
    "nevertheless , if the bars rotate in the same plane around their centers with angular velocities @xmath2 , @xmath3 , the potential pulsates with a frequency @xmath4 in the frame rotating with one of the bars ( note that the factor 2 comes from bisymmetry ) .    in the stationary potential of a single bar , particles on a closed periodic orbit move along it , always staying on the same curve .",
    "stable periodic orbits form `` backbones '' of a steady potential : nearby orbits are trapped around them .",
    "orbits in a double - barred galaxy will generally not be closed in any uniformly rotating frame of reference , since particles there undergo two forcing actions with non - commensurable frequencies .",
    "we want to extend the definition of an orbit , in order to find closed curves which can similarly serve as backbones of a non - steady , doubly barred system .",
    "we postulate that these are curves which , when populated with particles moving in a doubly barred potential , will return to their original positions every time the bars come back to the same relative orientation .",
    "we call these curves _ loops _  they are a generalization of the closed periodic orbit in a single bar ( see maciejewski & sparke 1997 ) . a particle that begins its orbit from a position along a given loop returns to another point on the same loop after the bars have realigned .",
    "loops change their shape as the bars rotate through each other .",
    "particles trapped around loops that stay aligned with the bars in their motion could build up a long - lived , self - consistent , doubly - barred galaxy , in the same way as particles trapped near closed periodic orbits in a singly barred potential .",
    "although here applied to two rigid bars rotating with constant pattern speeds , this method works for any potential pulsating with a constant period .",
    "in particular , the two bars do not have to be rigid , or to rotate with constant pattern speeds .",
    "we consider a phase space @xmath5 , whose points are the coordinates and momenta of particles at a given time",
    ". then we define the mapping @xmath6 , which assigns to each point in @xmath5 the coordinates of the corresponding particle after integrating its motion for one relative period @xmath7 of the bars .",
    "this mapping @xmath6 can be applied repeatedly , leading to consecutive _ iterated maps_. for each point @xmath8 of the phase space @xmath5 , the @xmath9@xmath10 is called the _ @xmath11 iterate _ of this point .",
    "the set of all iterates of a given point is called _ the orbit _ of this point _ under the mapping _ @xmath6 ( see lichtenberg & lieberman 1992 ) .",
    "thus defined , the orbits divide the phase space into non - overlapping invariant sets : no point can be on two distinct orbits .    a hamiltonian system in @xmath12 dimensions with a periodically varying potential can be written as an autonomous system ( one with a time - independent potential ) in @xmath13 dimensions ( see lichtenberg & lieberman 1992 , louis & gerhard 1988 ) .",
    "if we look only at orbits in the symmetry plane in which the bars rotate , our 2-d potential changing periodically with a fixed frequency is equivalent to a 3-d autonomous hamiltonian system .",
    "regular orbits in this 3-d system are those that behave as if they have 3 integrals of motion : they are confined to a 3-d hypersurface of the 6-d extended phase space of the autonomous system .",
    "our iterative mapping suppresses the dimension corresponding to time , so the 3-d hypersurface of a regular orbit is represented by a 2-d set of points . thus if a point @xmath8 lies on a regular orbit in the double - bar system ,",
    "its orbit under @xmath6 is a 2-dimensional hypersurface in the 4-d space .",
    "chaotic orbits will occupy 3 or 4 dimensions . if a point in the phase space @xmath5 lies on an orbit which closes after @xmath12 times the relative period , its orbit under the mapping @xmath6 will consist of a 0-dimensional set of @xmath12 points .",
    "what about a point @xmath14 , whose iterates form a 1-d curve ?",
    "this point is not on a periodic orbit ( since these form a 0-dimensional set under @xmath6 ) , but it corresponds to a particle moving on a special kind of a regular orbit ( those are only confined to 2-dimensional hypersurfaces ) .",
    "every time the two bars return to the same relative position , the iterates @xmath9@xmath10 always lie on this 1-d curve : we have _ a loop _ as defined in  2 . a particle that starts from any position on the loop will in general return to another place on the same loop every time the bars align .",
    "since no point can be on two distinct orbits , and since in general the iterates of one point on the loop fill the entire loop , every point @xmath8(*x*,*v * ) which lies on a loop contains all the information about this loop .    in figure [ makeloop]a",
    ", we show how consecutive iterates of @xmath14 generate a loop in a doubly barred galaxy .",
    "figure [ makeloop]b shows 200 , 400 and 4000 iterates @xmath6 for two points : the first lies near a stable loop , the second one does not . for the near - loop solution ,",
    "the points are confined to a ring around the stable loop .",
    "iterates of a typical point far from the loop quickly disperse , covering much of the phase space . thus a stable loop can be found by adjusting the coordinates of point @xmath14 , until its orbit under @xmath6 converges onto a 1-d closed curve .",
    "unstable loops can only be found in this way if we have a very good guess at the starting conditions .",
    "our method requires following a single particle for many bar rotations , and any particle starting close to an unstable loop will be lost by then .",
    "but since only stable loops can support the doubly barred systems , this is not a serious disadvantage .",
    "another way to look at stability is to compare the ring widths for e.g. 100 and 200 iterations .",
    "they should be similar for a stable loop .",
    "for an unstable loop , a nearby particle moves away exponentially with time , increasing the width .      to find iterates of point @xmath14 , we follow a particle in the @xmath15 plane in a given potential @xmath16 , in which two bars rotate independently about the @xmath17-axis .",
    "we solve the equation of motion in a reference frame rotating with pattern speed @xmath2 , which is equal to the angular speed of one of the bars . in the @xmath15 plane of the barred disk , @xmath18 , and one can write the equation of motion ( see formula 3 - 82 in binney & tremaine 1987 ) as @xmath19 in cartesian coordinates , it can be decomposed into its @xmath20 and @xmath21 parts : @xmath22 we integrated the equations above using a variable - order , variable - step adams integrating subroutine for first order differential equations .",
    "this predictor - corrector method is well suited to our problem , for which we expect multiply periodic solutions . under the forcing action of two bars",
    ", a particle can be given a kinetic energy large enough to escape .",
    "any particle departing from the potential center to distances a few times larger than the extent of the outer bar was considered to be lost , and we looked only for loops in and around the bars .",
    "we expect symmetric loops to be most important in symmetric bars .",
    "therefore we restricted our search to the loops which are symmetric with respect to both @xmath20- and @xmath21-axes when the bars are aligned on the @xmath20-axis : we reflected the successive iterates @xmath9@xmath10 about the two axes so that they occupy the @xmath23 region only .",
    "for symmetric loops the @xmath21-velocity on the @xmath21-axis is zero , and one can explore various initial @xmath20-velocities @xmath24 for a given @xmath21-axis crossing coordinate @xmath21 . to help us find the right @xmath24 , we used the epicyclic approximation of appendix a ( see also maciejewski & sparke 1997 ) . in general , consecutive iterates occupy the interior of a thick ring , but there is a range of @xmath24 for which the ring generated by a particle starting at that point looks almost 1-dimensional .",
    "we assume that the real loop is nearby , and we need a practical definition of the loop : given @xmath12 ( * x*,*v * ) pairs , we want to know if they lie on a 1-d curve . in principle",
    "this is not possible : there is a curve through any finite set of points .",
    "nevertheless , we are looking for simple curves",
    ". the ideal choice might be to find the shortest line connecting the phase space positions of all the points , and to minimize its length as @xmath24 varies .",
    "it is known though , that this task ( the ` traveling salesman problem ' ) is very expensive numerically : the number of operations needed to solve it grows exponentially with the number of points . instead",
    ", we search for the loop by varying @xmath24 in order to minimize the width of the ring in the @xmath15 plane formed by the iterates of the assumed starting point .    before minimizing",
    ", we adjusted each loop candidate for flattening in the @xmath15 plane by finding the points with maximum @xmath20-coordinates @xmath25 and maximum @xmath21-coordinates @xmath26 .",
    "then we rescaled the @xmath21-coordinates , multiplying them by @xmath27 , to give a roughly circular ring .",
    "this was divided into 20 sectors , and the points with the smallest and largest radii were found in each sector .",
    "the difference of these extremal radii gives the width of the ring in each of the 20 sectors .",
    "we define the overall ring width @xmath28 as the maximum width , or its average over the sectors .",
    "now , we can minimize @xmath28 with respect to the @xmath20-velocity and get the minimum width @xmath29 .",
    "both minimizations proved to be useful , and the method itself is efficient and fast . in principle , we should be able to bring the ring width arbitrarily close to zero by increasing the number of iterates and sectors , and adjusting the initial velocity @xmath24 . in practice ,",
    "20 sectors and 400 iterates proved to be good and efficient enough . a clear minimum is present at the same location for both estimates .",
    "we assume that the loop is generated by a particle with the starting @xmath20-velocity for which the width is minimal .",
    "the evolution of one loop thus defined is shown in figure [ compareloop ] , together with the corresponding solution of the epicyclic approximation for comparison .",
    "the epicyclic approximation remains close to the real loop , which justifies using this approximation to begin the loop search .",
    "for non - symmetric loops , we would have to minimize with respect to 2 parameters ; for example the initial values of @xmath24 and @xmath30 .",
    "iterates of a given point are not always spread uniformly around the ring , but sometimes collect into several distinct clumps .",
    "this happens when the frequency @xmath31 with which the particle circumnavigates the loop is almost commensurable with the potential oscillation frequency @xmath32 .",
    "if these frequencies remain close to a lower order resonance , the number of clumps is small , and there are few points outside the clumps .",
    "this may produce an additional spurious minimum in the average ring width , but the minimum is narrow and changes quickly with the starting @xmath21-coordinate when the whole loop family is examined ( see below ) , so its character is easily recognized .    in a single bar ,",
    "some of the periodic orbits are self - intersecting ; we expect to find self - intersecting loops in double bars as well .",
    "our method of minimizing the ring width only in position- or velocity - space obviously breaks down there .",
    "we could consider the loop in the 4-dimensional phase space , where it never intersects itself , at the cost of a considerably larger computational expense and less clear visual examination of the results .",
    "alternatively , we can calculate the width for part of the ring only .",
    "for example , if the loop intersects itself on the @xmath20-axis , these regions can be excluded from the calculation of the width .",
    "this procedure proved to be very fast and robust , and has been used exclusively .",
    "the epicyclic approximation provides at most one solution for the loops and orbits at a given guiding radius .",
    "additional loops , not predicted by the epicyclic approximation , can be present and may be dynamically important in the system of two bars . the only way to find them is to search the phase space of the initial conditions @xmath33 for the ring width @xmath28 values . in the following sections",
    ", we call this procedure the phase plane search . sets of points @xmath33 with low @xmath34 that group along continuous lines should indicate loop families : continuous functions @xmath35 for a range of @xmath21 and @xmath24 . the larger the region of low @xmath34 around the line marking a loop family , the more orbits such a loop family traps around itself , and thus the more useful ` backbone ' for building the galaxy it is .",
    "we searched for loop families by changing the initial value @xmath21 on the @xmath21-axis , and then adjusting the velocity @xmath24 , so that the new pair @xmath33 generates another loop .",
    "by analogy with periodic orbits in a single bar , we call @xmath35 _ the characteristic curve _ for a given family . in our search",
    "we noticed that the minimal width of the ring of iterates can sometimes be large , but the loop family preserves continuity .",
    "we therefore accepted some fairly shallow minima in the automatic loop search .",
    "doing so could derail the search from one loop family to another , if they come close to one another in the phase space @xmath33 . to clarify when the border between different families has been crossed , we searched for orbital families twice .",
    "once we did it by following particles starting on the @xmath21-axis , when the bars were both aligned on the @xmath20-axis , as described above .",
    "we did a second search , starting the particle on the @xmath21-axis when the big bar was still on the @xmath20 axis , but the small bar was perpendicular to it .",
    "if the search algorithm loses the loop , one can go back to the phase plane display : identifying the region where the loop was lost often helps to answer why it was lost .",
    "examples of this procedure will be given in sections 5 and 6 .",
    "to minimize the number of free parameters characterizing our models , we followed athanassoula ( 1992a ) in adopting analytical forms for the various potential components .",
    "our potential consists of a bulge , a disk and two bars .",
    "there is no halo : in these 2-dimensional calculations its contribution to the rotation curve is included in the disk potential .",
    "mass can be distributed arbitrarily into spherical and disk - like components , as long as they together make a realistic rotation curve .",

    "following athanassoula , we adopted the ferrers ellipsoid to describe both bars , with volume density @xmath72 where in cartesian coordinates @xmath73 .",
    "thus the isodensity surfaces of our bars are concentric ellipsoids of constant axis ratio , and each bar is described by 5 free parameters : the central density @xmath74 , the ferrers exponent @xmath75 , and 3 semi - axes .",
    "we adopt prolate bars , and will set @xmath76 , which reduces the number of free parameters to 3 .",
    "a larger index @xmath75 allows the higher derivatives of the potential to be continuous , which in turn reduces the fraction of chaotic orbits in the solution . if there are loops supporting doubly barred potentials , they are more likely to be found for bars with higher @xmath75 . in appendix b ,",

    "the @xmath91 loop family corresponds to the @xmath91 orbits in the outer bar .",
    "we see the inner part of the @xmath91 loop family clearly out to the radius where the bifurcation giving rise to the @xmath92 family takes place .",
    "the family abruptly discontinues above this point ( @xmath95250  when we refer to positions in @xmath35 diagrams in this and the following sections , the length units are kpc , and the velocity units are km s@xmath96 ) .",
    "the inner part of the @xmath91 loop family remains inside the inner ilr of the main bar .",
    "the @xmath91 loop family can be detected again for @xmath97 , between the two ilrs of the main bar .",
    "but here it is not accompanied by a wide dark region of near - loop solutions , indicating that it may be not able to trap many particles around itself .",
    "our plane search finds no clear @xmath91 loop family in the region @xmath98 , close to the outer ilr of the main bar ; there may be no loops there , or the resolution of our search may be too low  it shows only a grey region of near - loop solutions in this @xmath21 range . for larger @xmath21 this family is seen again , together with the accompanying dark grey band of near - loop solutions .",
    "the discontinuity of the @xmath91 family at large @xmath24 seems to be common in our double - bar potentials ; therefore we divide this family into an inner part @xmath99 inside the @xmath35 maximum and an outer part @xmath100 outside it .",
    "in addition to the @xmath91 and @xmath92 loop families , there is an interesting dark line marked in figure [ m1]a by @xmath8 , which departs from the inner @xmath91 family in the lower left corner of the phase plane ( @xmath101 , @xmath102 ) .",
    "it is examined separately below .",
    "no other loop families can be clearly seen in figure [ m1]a . in particular , there seem to be no stable loops corresponding to @xmath92 orbits of the small bar , although this bar has a pretty wide zone between inner and outer ilrs .",
    "all the loop families that we have found for model 1 are displayed in figure [ m1]b ; they are described in detail in the rest of this section .",
    "the thick lines correspond to well defined loops of small ring width ; thin lines represent loops that are still well defined as single minima , but with considerable ring widths .",
    "the broken lines correspond to regions where loops were not well defined , mostly because at fixed @xmath21 the ring width had multiple minima with @xmath24 , or the minimum value of @xmath34 was rapidly growing with @xmath21 .",
    "we were able to follow the @xmath92 family as a continuous minimum of the ring width from ( @xmath21=0.4 , @xmath24=130 ) to ( @xmath21=2.2 , @xmath24=140 ) , which remains inside the zone between inner and outer ilrs of the main bar .",
    "the @xmath92 loops still can be found in the range 2.2@xmath1032.8 , but the @xmath92 family is broken in this region .",
    "our attempts to follow it fail , because multiple ring width minima compete with one another as @xmath21 changes .",
    "a representative set of the @xmath92 loops in the frame rotating with the primary bar is shown in figure [ m1loops]a . here",
    "we confirm the hypothesis that we developed on the basis of the epicyclic approximation ( maciejewski & sparke 1997 ) : the outermost @xmath92 loops correspond to the @xmath92 orbits of the main bar and remain roughly perpendicular to it , while the inner loops of this family follow the secondary bar in their motion , and correspond to the @xmath91 orbits of the secondary bar .",
    "however , we can not trace the @xmath92 loops all the way to the center , while the @xmath91 orbits of a single bar generally do extend to the center .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume that our 2 bars are rigid and uniformly rotating .",
    "but the structure of the @xmath92 loops in figure [ m1loops ] tells us that it is a crude approximation only : the secondary bar , as outlined by its orbital ( loop ) structure , pulsates and accelerates as it moves through the main bar .",
    "the loops supporting the small bar are much thicker when it is parallel to the main bar : the minor axes of the inner loops are up to 1.8 times as large as when the bars are perpendicular .",
    "so if a secondary bar is self - consistently made out of particles trapped around these loops , then it should be thinner while perpendicular to the main bar . also , the @xmath92 loops lead the small bar as it moves from the parallel to perpendicular position , and trail behind it when it moves back to align with the main bar .",
    "one can conclude that in a self - consistent model , the small bar should decelerate when going out of alignment with the main bar , and accelerate when on its way back to the aligned position .",
    "these conclusions will be confirmed by the loop structure of model 2 .    in model 1",
    ", the @xmath92 loop family extends only to @xmath20=2 when the bars align on the @xmath20-axis , and only the loops extending roughly to @xmath20=1.5 there follow the small bar in its motion .",
    "but the secondary bar itself extends to @xmath104=4.2 kpc , so there are no loops which support the outer part of the secondary bar .",
    "by analogy with argument of contopoulos & papayannopoulos ( 1980 ) for the @xmath91 orbits in a single bar , we conclude that a self - consistent secondary bar can not extend outwards beyond the region where the @xmath92 loops follow its motion relative to the large bar .",
    "the @xmath92 loops populate the region between the ilrs of the large bar .",
    "so we conclude that the major axis of the small bar is unlikely to be larger than the outer extent of the @xmath92 orbital family of its main bar host along its major axis , unless the strength of the secondary bar relative to the main one is large enough to cause major changes in the loop structure .",
    "the inner @xmath91 loops ( the @xmath99 subfamily ) show a very regular behavior in figure [ m1]a , where they are seen as a thick line in the lower left corner .",
    "the @xmath35 curve is continuous throughout the whole region where these loops were detected : from the very center of the potential to @xmath21=0.223 . at this @xmath21 ,",
    "the @xmath20-velocity increases rapidly with @xmath21 and the loop family is lost in figure [ m1]a .",
    "the @xmath99 loops are almost circular and are represented by three innermost curves in figure [ m1loops]b .    unlike the @xmath99 loops , loops belonging to the @xmath100 subfamily ( outer @xmath91 loops )",
    "do not define a continuous function @xmath35 in the plot of figure [ m1]b .",
    "the loop searching code repeatedly lost track of the minimum after covering only a short @xmath21 range . for some @xmath21 ranges ,",
    "two comparably deep and wide minima were present , indicating that two loops exist at the same @xmath21 but with different starting velocities @xmath24 .",
    "the appearance of the @xmath100 loops is shown in figure [ m1loops]b .",
    "it is not regular , and these loops cover a very small part of the primary bar .",
    "therefore it appears unlikely that the primary bar can be built in a self - consistent manner in model 1 .",
    "although the secondary bar has an ilr , we found no loops corresponding to its @xmath92 orbits .",
    "instead , we found a family of loops indicated by the set of dark pixels in figure [ m1]a ( marked there by @xmath8 ) , that departs to the right from the thick band marking the @xmath99 loops .",
    "although this family is not surrounded by a dark band of particles trapped around these loops , the minimum ring width is well defined , and loops representative of this family are displayed in figure [ m1otherloops]a . when the two bars are aligned on the @xmath20-axis , the loops are perpendicular to them .",
    "but the loops precess in a sense opposite to the small bar , aligning with it when it makes an angle @xmath105 with the main bar , and becoming perpendicular to the small bar again when it in turn is perpendicular to the main bar .",
    "thus the figure of the loop moves retrograde , but loop particles remain on prograde orbits with respect to either bar .",
    "the inner loops become rounder , and this family joins the @xmath99 loops at the point @xmath21=0.13 , @xmath24=57 ( fig . [ m1]b ) .",
    "this family obviously does not correspond to the @xmath92 orbital family in the small bar , and it does not support either bar . nevertheless , it is consistently present in further modifications of model 1 , and in model 2 described below .    just as we can have multiply periodic orbits in a single bar , we can have higher order loops in double bars . if particles come back to the same curve only every other bar alignment , then after an odd number of alignments they lie along one curve , and after an even number , on another curve .",
    "thus a single particle generates two closed curves in this case .",
    "one can easily extend this to @xmath12 curves generated by a single particle returning to the same curve after every @xmath12 alignments of the bars .",
    "we found many such higher order loop families in our search , one of which is presented in figure [ m1otherloops]b : both curves constituting each loop there precess retrograde , with a period twice the the relative period of the two bars . in figure",
    "[ m1]b , this family ( marked by @xmath106 ) runs parallel to the abovementioned family , when the larger out of two @xmath21-axis crossing points is considered to be a loop generator .",
    "obviously , this family does not support any bar , and it is very unlikely that any of the higher order loop families can do it .",
    "although we expect that abundant and complex higher order loops are present , we did not search for them .",
    "louis & gerhard ( 1988 ) have shown , and the previous section illustrates , that bars which make up a self - consistent double - bar system must distort slightly as they rotate through each other .",
    "thus our assumed potential , with two rigidly rotating bars , can not be fully self - consistent .",
    "here we are looking only for a model that may be close to being self - consistent , in which stable regular orbits give support to both bars in their motion .",
    "a real bar would have some chaotic orbits as well , which we do not consider here .",
    "a system similar to model 1 could not be built in a self - consistent manner : its @xmath92 loops do not extend to the end of the secondary bar , and the @xmath91 loops cover only a small fraction of the primary bar . making the secondary bar stronger may help to extend the @xmath92 family , but it would destroy the @xmath91 loops , which are already quite disrupted by the small bar in model 1 .",
    "a different solution has to be found .",
    "first , we modified model 1 by increasing the @xmath107 axial ratio of both the bars from 2.5 to 4.0 , while the product @xmath108 of the axis lengths remained constant .",
    "the @xmath91 loop family virtually disappeared , except for the inner @xmath99 loops .",
    "the @xmath92 family broke into two well separated parts , and it may be difficult to support the secondary bar as well . on the basis of our limited search , weakness of the @xmath91 family seems to be a general feature of models with a relatively large , fast - rotating inner bar , like model 1 .",
    "the new model , hereafter model 2 , is meant to be as close to athanassoula s ( 1992a ) standard model as possible .",
    "the quadruple moment of the primary bar is twice as large as in model 1 . from model 1 , we know that the secondary bar should not be too big .",
    "first we tried a long , but not massive ( @xmath109 , @xmath110 ) , secondary bar .",
    "the phase plane search showed that the @xmath91 family , which should support the longer bar , is practically absent for @xmath1110.9 , while the bar length is @xmath112 .",
    "the @xmath92 family is broken into two parts , both surrounded by regions of trapped semi - periodic orbits .",
    "this model may have a nearly self - consistent secondary bar , but can not support the primary bar , and therefore has to be rejected .",
    "then we tried a smaller , but more massive secondary bar ( @xmath113 , @xmath114 ) .",
    "the loops from the @xmath91 family extend far enough in radius ( @xmath115 ) to support part of the primary bar .",
    "the inner part of the @xmath91 family is quite extended , though : it suppresses the @xmath92 family , which in turn appears irregular and disrupted on the phase plane . in this model ,",
    "part of the primary bar can be supported by loops , but the secondary bar is likely to be far from self - consistent .",
    "the two attempts above suggest that our secondary bar is still too massive , or too large .",
    "observations presented in  4 confirm this suspicion : the ratio of semimajor axes of the bars in the model , is beyond the observed range for our model with @xmath116 , and at the lower end of the observed range for the model with @xmath117 . guided by the values listed in table 2 , we decided to make the secondary bar smaller and less massive .",
    "the ellipticity of the observed secondary bars is considerably smaller than that of the primary ones ; therefore we set the axial ratio of the secondary bar at @xmath118 .",
    "the small bar is only 20% as long as the primary bar and has only 15% of the big bar s mass . since in model 1",
    "the loops supporting the small bar failed to extend all the way to its corotation , in model 2 we set the pattern speed so that the lagrangian radius of the secondary bar is at @xmath119 .",
    "this also puts corotation of the small bar at the outer ilr of the big one , as suggested by tagger ( 1987 ) .",
    "we constructed model 2 with a particular interest in loops supporting the potential . we want to answer the question ,",
    "is it possible to construct a model close to this one in a self - consistent way ?",
    "our first task is to survey the structure of @xmath91 and @xmath92 loop families , which we expect to support the primary and secondary bar , respectively .",
    "the results of the phase plane search for model 2 are displayed in figure [ m2]a .",
    "both @xmath91 and @xmath92 loop families are present there , with trapped orbits around them indicated by the dark areas .",
    "note how similar this figure is to figure [ m2sgl]a , in which a phase plane search for model 2 with the main bar only was presented .",
    "unlike in model 1 , this plane search suggests that both bars are likely to be supported by stable loops .",
    "figure [ m2]b shows the characteristic curves and the variation of minimum ring width @xmath29 along each loop family .",
    "we find an additional loop family , marked there by @xmath120 , supporting part of the main bar .",
    "we were able to find loops belonging to the @xmath92 family for @xmath121 .",
    "just before the @xmath92 family is lost at small @xmath21 , the velocity drops rapidly . at the high-@xmath21 end of the @xmath92 family , the ring widths increase making it harder to find the loop , before the loops disappear ( fig.[m2]b )",
    "this family has two interesting features .",
    "first , around @xmath21=0.406 , the characteristic curve is discontinuous , and there is a small @xmath21 range where no loops have been found .",
    "this corresponds to the white stripe crossing the @xmath92 arch in the phase plane search of fig .",
    "the minimal ring width @xmath29 increases steadily as this discontinuity is approached from both lower and higher @xmath21 s , before the width experiences a sudden jump .",
    "a detailed search for loops in this @xmath21 range found no simple smooth invariant 1-d curve ; but for a wide range of @xmath24 , the particles are confined to well - defined rings .",
    "no higher order loops were detected in this region .",
    "it is possible that a similar small discontinuity occurs at @xmath21=1.86 .",
    "here , the ring width jumps an order of magnitude above its normal level over a narrow @xmath21-range , where we find no simple smooth 1-d curves .",
    "again , for a wide @xmath24 range we observe that the particles are confined to rings there .    at @xmath122 , the @xmath35 curve for the @xmath92 loops",
    "splits in two ; over a small range , there are two loops for each @xmath21 value .",
    "the accompanying plot of ring widths shows that when approaching this region from higher @xmath21 , the width of loops increases rapidly , and the searching code effectively loses the loop family .",
    "the minimum followed by our continuous search is no longer the global minimum , and another minimum is found which generates the continuation of this family to smaller @xmath21 .",
    "the overall appearance of the @xmath92 loops in model 2 is presented in the central panels of figure [ m2loops ] . the @xmath92 loops with @xmath123 rotate with the small bar and",
    "extend out to about 0.85 - 0.9 of its semimajor axis .",
    "there the density in an @xmath75=2 ferrers bar has dropped to 4% of its central value .",
    "thus we conclude that the secondary bar is well supported by @xmath92 loops : even if the family breaks at @xmath124 , there are ` near - loop ' solutions , and particles trapped around these can serve as the building blocks of the inner bar . here",
    "we can also confirm our conclusion drawn on the basis of model 1 , that the secondary bar pulsates and accelerates , although these effects are smaller in model 2 .",
    "figure [ m2]b shows two disconnected parts of the @xmath91 family , which were detected with the search method described in section 3.2 : the @xmath99 loops ( inner @xmath91 ) at @xmath125 and the @xmath100 loops ( outer @xmath91 ) at @xmath126 .",
    "the @xmath99 loops show a rapid growth in the @xmath20-velocity with @xmath21 , and for @xmath127120 , this loop family continues for decreasing @xmath21 with velocities still growing .",
    "therefore the @xmath99 loops are double - valued in this range .",
    "they can not be traced beyond the point @xmath24=310 , @xmath21=0.024 , corresponding to a dark pixel in figure [ m2]a .",
    "we explore the question of connection between the inner and outer @xmath91 families later in this section .",
    "the @xmath100 loops are not as well defined as the @xmath99 and @xmath92 loops  the minimum ring widths are larger . near @xmath21=0.65 and 0.85",
    ", they rise to unacceptable values of 50% and 30% of the ring size , but no discontinuity in the loop family tracing is seen .",
    "we will return to this feature later in this section .",
    "in general , for the @xmath100 loops there is no clear single @xmath128 minimum for a given @xmath21 , but rather several less deep minima , of which one usually dominates .",
    "this is similar to what the @xmath92 loops experience near @xmath129 . for @xmath100 loops ,",
    "two minima of roughly equal depth persist for the @xmath21 range from 1.85 to 2.4 , and are displayed as two parallel lines in figure [ m2]b . in this region ,",
    "the ring widths increase with @xmath21 for the loops marked with a solid line , and this branch of the @xmath100 loops is eventually lost at @xmath21=2.4 . at that @xmath21 ,",
    "the widths on the other branch , marked with a dashed line , become small and behave in a very regular way .",
    "this branch is lost in turn at @xmath21=2.65 . at 2.57@xmath1033.22 ,",
    "another branch of the @xmath100 loops exists ; this is the branch extending to the highest @xmath21 in model 2 .",
    "we consider the solid line extending from @xmath21=0.5 to 2.4 to be the main part of the @xmath100 family , and we call the two abovementioned branches the @xmath100 family additions .    the dotted line parallel to the @xmath100 family and persisting for the @xmath21 range from 0.54 to 1.4 ( fig",
    ". [ m2]b ) , marks another loop family found in model 2 , which we name @xmath120 for their bow - tie appearance . below 1 kpc ,",
    "the ring widths for the @xmath120 loops are smaller than those of the @xmath100 loops , and the widths behave in a more regular way .",
    "figure [ m2loops ] displays representatives of all loop families found for model 2 , as they change while the two bars rotate relative to each other .",
    "the two outermost loops belong to the two outer additions to the @xmath100 family .",
    "the next four loops inside them belong to the main part of the @xmath100 family , and they undergo interesting oscillations when the two bars rotate through one another .",
    "the loop that is innermost when the bars are aligned ( top left panel ) develops cusps , and becomes much rounder : it ends up as a second outermost loop when the bars are orthogonal ( bottom right panel ) .",
    "this leaves us with no @xmath100 loops supporting the inner part of the main bar when the bars are orthogonal ( bottom right panel ) .",
    "but there is one more loop inside the above mentioned set of four , which remains parallel to the main bar .",
    "it intersects itself at bars aligned , and belongs to the @xmath120 family marked in figure [ m2]b by a dotted line .",
    "loops from this family take a boxy shape at bars orthogonal and fill the central part of the main bar , thus supporting it in addition to the @xmath91 loops .",
    "the @xmath99 loops are displayed against the @xmath92 loops in the 4 inner panels of figure [ m2loops ] .",
    "the double - valued @xmath35 curve for these loops means that when the two bars are aligned , two loops from this family cross the @xmath21-axis at the same point .",
    "one set of these loops is close to circular and can be detected all the way to the potential center , the other one is elongated and gets longer with decreasing @xmath21 , up to a semimajor axis of 0.5 kpc for @xmath21=0.024 , where the family disappears .",
    "these narrow loops get stretched when the bars are orthogonal , but their semimajor axes roughly do not change , and they remain well aligned with the primary bar .",
    "note that the @xmath99 loops are narrowest at bars aligned , unlike the @xmath92 loops which are narrower at bars orthogonal .",
    "figure [ m2loops ] also shows that in a potential of two independently rotating bars , sets of loops supporting the bars can penetrate through one another while each follows a different bar . if there are enough stars trapped on the @xmath99 loops , such a galaxy may appear as having a triple bar , with innermost and outermost bars aligned .      one can get a more complete insight into the loop families in double bars by performing an additional search , with particles starting on the minor axis of the main bar ( the @xmath21-axis ) , moving perpendicular to that axis , when the bars were orthogonal .",
    "phase plane search of figure [ m2ort]a indicates both the @xmath91 loops ( the upper arch ) and @xmath92 loops ( inner arch and plateau ) .",
    "a close - up of the upper arch is shown in figure [ m2ort]b : many bright strips running from the top - left to the bottom - right indicate areas where the iterates are no longer confined to a ring .",
    "the @xmath91 family is broken when they cross its dark arch .",
    "the structure at such intersections is similar to the features common in characteristic diagrams for orbits in a fixed potential , usually called the 4/1-like gaps ( contopoulos & grosbl 1989 )",
    ". it can be best seen at @xmath130 , @xmath131 in figure [ m2ort]b . around @xmath132",
    ", there is a white strip which separates two dark strips : one surrounding the @xmath120 family and originating at the top - left corner , and the other surrounding the @xmath100 loops originating on the right .",
    "it looks like this white strip overlaps with what would be an @xmath91 orbital family in a single bar there ( see fig .",
    "[ m2sgl]a ) , and it is unlikely that stable loops can be found there .    comparing the loop families found with particles starting at the bars orthogonal with those found by the original search method earlier in this section allowed for a more complete picture of loops supporting the main bar .",
    "figure [ m2comp ] shows the characteristic diagrams for these loops , both at bars aligned and orthogonal .",
    "the @xmath100 loops , which occupied the region from 0.22 to 2.4 kpc in @xmath21 at bars aligned , are compressed into a @xmath133 range at bars orthogonal . in this configuration",
    ", we find no @xmath100 loops at @xmath134 to support the main bar .",
    "when the bars are orthogonal , at 1.4@xmath1032.2 this family develops an interesting zig - zag on the characteristic curve ( fig.[m2comp]b ) .",
    "it means that the innermost loops at bars aligned get pushed away at bars orthogonal and end up as the outermost ones .",
    "we gave an example of such a loop in section 6.2.2 .",
    "on the diagonal of the ` z ' the trend reverses , and loops pulsate without changing their order .",
    "eventually , the trend reverses again ( the top of the ` z ' ) ; the loop which is outermost when the bars are aligned sinks inside , and is innermost at bars orthogonal . at the points ( @xmath1351.4 , @xmath136=308 ) and ( @xmath21=1.8 , @xmath137250 ) ,",
    "where the @xmath100 characteristic curve reverses , there is a set of rings that for a short range continues in the direction before reversing , but the ring widths increase rapidly .    in some regions of the lower branch of the ` z ' at bars orthogonal",
    ", loops do not transform to points on the @xmath100 characteristic curve at bars aligned monotonically , but get spread over a large @xmath21 range .",
    "the transformed curve is disrupted at several places , which correspond to high ring widths for loops found at bars aligned ( fig.[m2]b ) .",
    "some real gaps in the stable loop families likely occur there , which are not just artifacts of our method .",
    "thus the ` high width ' found with our method may suggest that the loop sequence is broken and we may encounter part of a different family with a short stability range .",
    "the @xmath120 family and the two disconnected @xmath100 branches at high @xmath21 in figure [ m2comp]a reverse order at bars orthogonal ( the innermost loop becomes the outermost one ) .",
    "the two outer additions to the @xmath91 family may be connected by bridges similar to the diagonal of the ` z ' in the main @xmath100 subfamily : at @xmath138 , @xmath139 , the first addition to the @xmath100 loops changes order and aims towards the second addition , but we were not able to find a continuation for this set of loops .",
    "we tried to find loops that could connect the @xmath99 and @xmath100 subfamilies .",
    "our search at bars orthogonal resulted in finding loops represented by an arch at @xmath21=0.2 , @xmath137450 in figure [ m2comp]b .",
    "it may be a continuation of the @xmath99 subfamily extending to the galaxy center , but no connection of those two has been found .",
    "several gaps in the ` @xmath91 arch ' there seen in the phase plane search ( fig.[m2ort]b ) , suggest discontinuities in the @xmath91 family . the @xmath99 arch in figure [ m2comp]a most likely has no connection with @xmath100 loops either , since the @xmath120 loop family seems to separate them .      the main @xmath91 family in model 2 consists of 2 subfamilies with some additions :    1 .",
    "the inner @xmath99 subfamily originating at ( @xmath140 , @xmath141 ) , 2 .",
    "the addition to the inner @xmath99 loops marked by the arch in figure [ m2comp ] , 3 .",

    "two outer additions to the @xmath100 subfamily .",
    "there is an additional family , the @xmath120 or bow - tie loops , but it still leaves a gap without a continuous set of simple stable loops for 0.5@xmath1031.4 at bars orthogonal .",
    "there are some small loop subfamilies found at 0.7@xmath1031.5 at bars orthogonal , but they are discontinuous",
    ". there are absolutely no loops at 0.5@xmath1030.7  there is a white strip of diverging iterates overlapping that part of the dark ` @xmath91 arch ' on the phase space diagram in fig.[m2ort]b .    in conclusion",
    ", we would say that the @xmath91 and @xmath120 loops support most of the main bar at bars aligned .",
    "the @xmath100 loops are strongly influenced by the motion of the secondary bar . at bars",
    "orthogonal , they get rounder and group in the outer parts of the main bar . we were not able to find any @xmath91 loops supporting the inner part of the main bar when the secondary bar is perpendicular to it ",
    "the @xmath120 loops fill up the center there , but a small gap between these two families remains ( fig.[m2loops ] ) . in section 6.2.1",
    "we showed that the secondary bar is fully supported by the @xmath92 loops .",
    "the main goal of this work was to explore whether a galactic stellar disk with two non - equal bars rotating at different pattern speeds is dynamically possible .",
    "the ` backbone ' for the orbital structure of this time - periodic system is provided by stable loops .",
    "these are closed curves , such that particles placed on them and moving in the potential of this system will return to the original curve after two bars have come back to the same relative orientation .",
    "a nearly self - consistent double bar should have stable loops elongated with each bar over appropriate radial range . in section 6",
    ", we gave an example of a doubly barred system where stable loops existed with the right shape , over the right range in radius , to support both the inner and the outer bars .",
    "to create conditions most favorable to the existence of stable loops , we selected a smooth potential by choosing a high ferrers index of the bars ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "we also minimized the number of resonances by putting the corotation of the small bar at the outer ilr of the main bar .",
    "this overlapping of resonances , although not essential for the existence of self - consistent double bars , may be natural in dynamical systems ( see tagger 1987 ) .",
    "our secondary bar was slow rotating , with corotation well beyond end of bar . to have the same resonant condition for a fast - rotating secondary bar , the inner bar would have to extend to the outer ilr of the main bar .",
    "in such a case , all the @xmath92 loops should follow the secondary bar in its motion , a configuration that we were not able to create .",
    "on the basis of our models , we believe that for double bars we may not be able to have both resonance overlapping and a secondary bar extending to its corotation .",
    "the morphology of the gas flow in a barred potential strongly depends on the bar pattern speed .",
    "straight shocks , often seen in large - scale bars , occur when the bar is rapidly rotating , it extends at least to 80% of its corotation . for slower bars , the shocks curl around the bar and start forming a ring ( athanassoula 1992b ) .",
    "thus in a slowly rotating secondary bar , we expect an elliptical flow to develop instead of straight shocks ( maciejewski 1999 ) .",
    "the actual gas morphology will obviously be influenced by stars - gas interaction , self - gravity in the gas , and star formation processes , none of which is considered in this simple scenario .",
    "we have shown that doubly barred galaxy potentials allow stable regular orbits that can support the shape of both inner and outer bars .",
    "these multiply barred galaxies can be built as gravitationally self - consistent systems .",
    "in doubly barred galaxies , the most important loop families , which serve as their backbones , occupy the same parts of phase space as the @xmath91 and @xmath92 orbits in the single bar .",
    "the loop family corresponding to the @xmath91 orbital family in the main bar , always remains elongated along the main bar , even though the inner loops reside inside the secondary bar .",
    "the @xmath92 loop family , which at large radii behaves like the @xmath92 orbital family of the main bar , follows the secondary bar in its motion at smaller radii . no loop family corresponding to the @xmath92 orbital family in the secondary bar has been found .    despite a limited number of models",
    ", we were able to draw conclusions about constraints that the orbital structure puts on the shapes , relative sizes and frequencies of the bars .",
    "the secondary bar can be supported by the @xmath92 loops which rotate smoothly with its figure .",
    "these loops change axial ratio as the bars rotate , and lead or trail the figure of the secondary bar , depending on the relative phase of the two bars",
    ". a self - consistent secondary bar , supported by stars trapped around these loops , must pulsate and accelerate as it revolves inside the main bar .",
    "since the @xmath92 loops originate from the @xmath92 orbits in the potential of a larger bar , the size of a self - consistent secondary bar is approximately limited by the maximum extent of the @xmath92 orbits along the main bar s major axis .",
    "because of these limitations , we were not able to find a self - consistent model of a doubly barred galaxy in which the secondary bar remains in resonant coupling with the main bar , and extends all the way to its corotation .",
    "our nearly self - consistent model contains a slowly rotating secondary bar .",
    "a strong secondary bar can easily disrupt the @xmath91 loops supporting the main bar ; thus there are upper limits for the mass and size of the small bar .",
    "the inner region of the large bar can also be supported by another loop family , which we call the bow - tie or @xmath120 family .",
    "the loops supporting one bar rotate through the ones supporting the other",
    ". stars can be trapped around both these sets of loops , but gas can reside on at most one of them .",
    "the concept of the loop developed in this paper provides a powerful tool to study particle orbits in any periodically pulsating gravitational potential : in double bars , pulsating spheres , and eccentric binaries .",
    "it is most promising in the last case : the motion of a massless test particle under the gravitational force of two point masses ( the restricted three body problem ) , where only a few isolated closed orbits have been found so far .",

    ".      in planar polar coordinates ( @xmath146 ) the linearized equation of motion ( [ eqmot ] ) yields following equations for @xmath147 and @xmath148 first order corrections to the guiding center motion @xmath149 where @xmath150 .",
    "if in addition to the main bar rotating rigidly with angular velocity @xmath2 , there is another , secondary bar rotating with angular velocity @xmath3 , the first order term @xmath144 in the multipole expansion of the potential in the frame of the main bar becomes time - dependent , and consists of two bisymmetric terms @xmath151 where @xmath152 , and the time @xmath153 was chosen such that @xmath154 when bars are parallel .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side corresponds to the main bar , at rest in its own frame , and the second one describes the secondary bar , which rotates in this frame . after substituting @xmath155 and @xmath156 ,",
    "the right - hand sides of equations ( [ eqr1 ] ) and ( [ eqphi1 ] ) , for radial and azimuthal motion respectively , become @xmath157 in general , we can start a particle orbit at any relative position of the bars , at an arbitrary time @xmath158 , with its guiding center at an arbitrary angle @xmath159 .",
    "the angle @xmath160 of the epicycle center at a given time @xmath153 is then @xmath161 , where @xmath162 .",
    "the two bars induce two characteristic forcing frequencies , so we introduce two time counters , to integrate the equations of motion in a way analogous to wada ( 1994 ) .",
    "the first frequency is @xmath31 and the corresponding time @xmath163 is defined by @xmath164 .",
    "the second frequency is @xmath165 with the corresponding time defined by @xmath166 .",
    "equation ( [ eqphi1 ] ) for the azimuthal motion , with right - hand side stated explicitly in ( [ dbleeta ] ) , can be integrated over time to single out @xmath167 and substitute it back to equation ( [ eqr1 ] ) for the radial motion .",
    "thus we have the second order equation for @xmath147 in the doubly barred case @xmath168 where @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 is the free epicyclic frequency defined by @xmath172 , and @xmath8 is the oort constant . in equation ( [ dblezetabis ] ) , one can substitute @xmath173 and perform a standard separation of variables , which leads to two decoupled equations @xmath174 of the form exactly like wada s equation ( 4 ) , the solution of which we already know .",
    "the steady - state solution for @xmath147 in a doubly barred potential consists then of two terms and can be written in the form @xmath175",

    "a similar solution can be written for @xmath180 .",
    "there is an obvious way to extend this method to the arbitrary number of @xmath12 bars by performing a separation of @xmath12 corresponding variables .    clearly , the orbits in a potential of two independently rotating bars do not close . but from equation ( [ r1fin ] ) we can see that the time transformation @xmath181 is equivalent to the initial angle transformation @xmath182 .",
    "this means that after time @xmath183 , when the two bars return to the same relative orientation , the particle ends up at a place , which at the last time was occupied by another particle , with its guiding center at the same radius , but position angle differing by @xmath184",
    ". therefore particles having the same guiding radius interchange positions at consecutive bar alignments , while remaining on the curve appropriate to the guiding radius @xmath71 .",
    "this curve is the epicyclic approximation to _ the loop _ ; in this linear approximation , a loop is a set of particles which have the same guiding radius , and lack any free epicyclic motion , but respond only to the periodic forcing of the two bars .",
    "a general orbit with that same guiding center will oscillate about the loop .",
    "loops in the epicyclic approximation are presented for model 1 in maciejewski & sparke ( 1997 ) .",
    "lindblad & lindblad ( 1994 ) and wada ( 1994 ) showed that if a dissipative term is added to the equations of motion of a particle orbiting in a single rotating bar , the pattern of closed orbits in linearized solution closely reflects the gas streamlines in flows modeled hydrodynamically .",
    "this _ damped epicyclic approximation _ gives us a cheap way to preview the hydrodynamic simulation .",
    "obviously , this approach can not reproduce a shock structure , or give the inflow rate .    adding a friction term @xmath185 to equation ( [ eqmot ] ) we get @xmath186 a true friction term",
    "@xmath187 should be proportional to the velocity gradient in the gas , but this information is not available _ a priori _ , so we must use other forms of the dissipative term .",
    "we may postulate that the frictional force is proportional to the difference between the particle velocity @xmath188 and the circular velocity @xmath189 at its position in an axisymmetric potential @xmath143 , which is zero for a particle in circular orbit in that potential .",
    "the dissipative force @xmath187 in the inertial frame can be written as @xmath190 where @xmath191 is the particle s position in the inertial frame , and @xmath192 is the friction coefficient : the minus sign means that dissipation tends to reduce velocity deviations for positive @xmath192 .",
    "the friction described by lindblad & lindblad ( 1994 ) leads to this same expression for @xmath187 , so we call this form the ` lindblad friction ' .    the rotation speed @xmath193 in the inertial frame is related to the speed @xmath188 in a frame rotating with the primary bar by @xmath194 , thus equation ( [ fric1a ] ) becomes @xmath195 .\\ ] ] the bar pattern speed enters the friction formula because the dissipative term depends on both radial and tangential velocity deviations from the circular orbit .",
    "wada ( 1994 ) used another form of friction , which depends on radial velocity deviations only : @xmath196 in dissipative motion , the two components of particle velocity are coupled , which makes these two forms of friction compatible .    for lindblad s friction , we get in a single bar the second order equation for the radial correction @xmath147 @xmath197 where @xmath163 is the same as defined for equation ( [ dblezetabis ] ) , and @xmath198 . when we use wada s friction defined in equation ( [ fric2 ] ) ,",
    "the second order equation for @xmath147 takes the form @xmath199 the epicyclic frequency @xmath171 depends on the friction strength for the lindblad friction , but is the same as in the case with no friction when wada s friction is used .",
    "the damping term is half as large for wada s friction , which damps radial deviations only .    for lindblad s friction",
    ", the dissipative counterpart of the second order differential equation ( [ dblezetabis ] ) for @xmath147 in the doubly barred case can be written as @xmath200 where the additional coefficients are @xmath201 and @xmath202 . in presence of friction ,",
    "we get the following steady - state solution for @xmath147 in a doubly barred potential @xmath203                                       + b_s \\sin [ 2\\varphi_{0s } + \\omega ( t - t_s ) - \\omega_p t ] \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & -\\frac{a_{0b}}{\\omega } & \\left ( a_b \\cos [ 2\\varphi_{0s } + \\omega ( t - t_s ) ]                                       + b_b \\sin [ 2\\varphi_{0s } + \\omega ( t - t_s ) ]   \\right ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where for a dissipative case @xmath204 , @xmath205 , @xmath206 , and @xmath207 .",
