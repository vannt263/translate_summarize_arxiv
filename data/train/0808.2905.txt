    "these experiments were performed in the regime of large dqd current , strong bias voltage applied to the qpc and large tunneling coupling , which is similar to our situation here .",
    "the dqd current was related to inelastic relaxation of electrons in partly transmitting 1d channels of the qpc  @xcite and qualitatively consistent with an energy transfer mechanism based on nonequilibrium acoustic phonons .",
    "@xcite in contrast to our experimental data , in these experiments the dqd current was large when the conductance of the qpc was tuned to @xmath5 and strongly suppressed in plateau regions .",
    "recent research has proven that the absorption of a photon can be the dominant process  @xcite in similar situations .",
    "however , these time - resolved experiments were performed in a different regime , where the dominant tunneling rates are of order of 1 khz , whereas in our system the double quantum dot is much more strongly coupled to the leads .",
    "another difference is the presence of a ti top - gate in our structure , that screens the electrostatic interaction between the dqd and the qpcs . due to the lower sensitivity of direct dot current measurements compared to the time - resolved technique",
    "it is not possible to observe the gap in the dqd current when @xmath115 .",
    "calculations of the emission and absorption rates in a dqd induced by electron - photon interaction show , that the effect is irrelevant compared to the emission and absorption of phonons discussed here .",
    "@xcite    we have also tested the possibility that the entire dot current in the region forbidden by the coulomb blockade is due to a thermopower effect induced by different temperatures in the source and the drain .",
    "we found , that it would be only possible if the temperature difference between source and drain lead was larger than 1k for a qpc current of 100 na , which is one order of magnitude larger than expected .",
    "@xcite another argument against a thermopower model is that always the drain lead would have to be warmer , even if the far qpc1 ( that couples better to the drain lead ) was biased .",
    "even so , the thermopower model did not describe the data as well as the emission / absorption model .",
    "we have presented the influence of two independent quantum point contacts on a double quantum dot . a number of of questions arising during the investigation and presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : mechanisms ] could be answered .    in the first place",
    ", we established the possible dominant mechanism of energy transfer between the double quantum dot and the quantum point contact in the investigated regime .",
    "driving current through the qpc leads to emission of energy that increases the temperature of the bosonic environment .",
    "we identify these bosons as acoustic phonons . to model the interaction of the phonons with the double quantum dot we have assumed that their energy distribution is described by bose - einstein statistics .",
    "another important point is a non - additive effect of both qpc currents .",
    "it is understood in terms of the temperature of the bosonic bath .",
    "we find that the dqd current is proportional to the power emitted by the qpcs .",
    "next , we interpreted the leveling off of the dqd current as a qpc current is increased .",
    "for large qpc powers ( above 0.1  nw ) the temperature of the phonon bath increases linearly .",
    "the observed saturation of the current is due to the finite transparency of the tunneling barriers and not to the high occupation probabilities @xmath116 .    the polarity dependence ( fig .",
    "[ fig : addition ] ) can not be explained within the discussed model and its origin remains to be investigated .",
    "it would be interesting to further investigate this effect , for example , by using different geometrical arrangements .    finally , we observed strong deviation from perfect antisymmetry of the dot current along the detuning line when the qpc current is driven .",
    "it can be attributed to the asymmetry of the source and drain barriers .",
