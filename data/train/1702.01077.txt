    "consider a finite connected graph @xmath2 ( for simplicity @xmath2 will denote also the set of its vertices ) with some designated vertex called _ origin _ @xmath3 and some non - empty set of _ border vertices _",
    "we define recursively set of _ sticky vertices _",
    "@xmath5 , with @xmath6 .",
    "the process runs as follows : a particle starts some sort of random walk originated at @xmath7 on @xmath2 , and whenever it comes within the immediate vicinity ( i.e.  one edge away ) from a sticky vertex , random walks stops and this particle joins the sets of sticky vertices .",
    "then a new particle starts a random walk at @xmath3 and runs until it stops , and the process restarts again , until @xmath3 becomes sticky itself , at which point the process stops completely .",
    "we are interested in random quantity @xmath8 , the total number of particles emitted from the origin during the lifespan of the process , which always satisfies @xmath9 where @xmath10 for @xmath11 is the number of edges in shortest path connecting @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the number of vertices in @xmath2 and @xmath16 respectively .    formally , define a sequence of subsets @xmath17 , @xmath18 , such that @xmath6 and @xmath19 where @xmath20 is defined as follows : for @xmath21 let @xmath22 , @xmath23 be a random walk on @xmath2 such that @xmath24 and @xmath25 then @xmath26 we call the above model border aggregation model ( _ ba model _ for short ) .",
    "we study the ba model on a variety of graphs , namely , the star graph , regular @xmath1ary trees , and the integer lattice for dimensions @xmath27 . incidentally",
    "( yuval peres , personal communications ; also  ) , the ba model on a finite piece of the integer line is equivalent to the ok corral model of  @xcite , where its asymptotic behaviour has been completely analysed .",
    "note that ba model was called _ internal erosion model _ in  , however , we feel that the term `` border aggregation model '' is more appropriate .",
    "the authors of this paper also guess that on a disk of radius @xmath28 in @xmath29 the number of _ eroded points _",
    ", which coincides with the number of emitted particles in ba model , grows asymptotically at the rate of @xmath30 , the conjecture which we partially solve here .    according to  , the model on @xmath31 , @xmath32 , can be viewed as an  inversion \" of the classical diffusion - limited - aggregation model ( dla ) , in which particles performing random walks are released at infinity , and they stop once they reach some nearest neighbour of the cluster , which initially consists only of the origin . when @xmath33 kesten  @xcite showed that with probability one the maximum radius of the random cluster is eventually at most of the order @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the number of accumulated particles ; the corresponding order for @xmath36 is @xmath37 .",
    "this suggests that for @xmath33 with high probability the number of emitted particles @xmath0 in the ba model should be at least of the order @xmath38 , and for @xmath36 , at least @xmath39 particles must be emitted .",
    "in section  [ sec:2-dim - lattice ] we obtain a slightly worse lower bound of @xmath40 for case @xmath33 . in section",
    "[ sec : d - ge-3 ] we show that if @xmath41 , then @xmath0 must grow at least as @xmath39 with probability converging to one , which we believe is the correct order .",
    "as it was mentioned above , the ba model is close to the internal diffusion - limited - aggregation - model on @xmath31 studied e.g.  in  @xcite . in the process",
    "studied in  @xcite initially only the origin is occupied , and particles perform simple random walks until the moment they visit a vertex outside of the cluster , at which point they stop and become part of the cluster .",
    "the authors show that with probability @xmath42 the limiting shape of the cluster can be well approximated by the @xmath1dimensional ball centred at the origin .",
    "these results were further improved in  @xcite where it was proved that the maximal error for the dla cluster is @xmath43 respectively for @xmath33 , and @xmath44 ; moreover , the fluctuations ( appropriately normalized ) of the cluster converge in law to gaussian free field .",
    "similar results were also obtained independently in  @xcite .",
    "the model has been also studied on the comb lattice in  @xcite , and similar limiting shape theorems have been obtained .",
    "another model similar to the ba model has been studied in  @xcite .",
    "the authors introduce a process where one particle is placed at each location in the interval @xmath45 $ ] , and at every step a randomly chosen particle from @xmath46 $ ] is moved to the left until the whole process coalesce at the origin .",
    "the authors show that the random time until the coalescence grows asymptotically at the rate of @xmath38 , and the variance is upper bounded by @xmath47 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : star ]",
    "we study the ba model on star graphs . in section  [ sec : trees ] we obtain quite sharp bounds for @xmath0 on regular trees . in section  [ sec:2-dim - lattice ]",
    "we analyze the model on the two - dimensional lattice and a comb lattice ; in section  [ sec : d - ge-3 ] we obtain the results for higher dimensions . in the latter two cases we obtain non - trivial lower bounds only .",
