    "due to multiple scattering of light , disordered media such as paper , paint or biological tissue have very high reflection and look opaque .",
    "however , wave interference effect may diminish the reflectance by creating highly transmitting channels called `` open channels '' @xcite . the recent developments of adaptive wavefront shaping and phase recording techniques in optics have enabled the coupling of incident light to these open channels @xcite .",
    "the open channels can greatly enhance light transmission through scattering media , that will have a profound impact in a wide range of applications from deep tissue imaging and laser surgery to spectroscopy and opto - genetics @xcite .",
    "so far most experimental studies of high transmission channels rely on the optical access to both sides of the scattering media , which is not practical in realistic situations .",
    "it is known that there is an one - to - one correspondence between the transmission eigenchannels and reflection eigenchannels in turbid media without absorption .",
    "thus the information about the transmission channels may be obtained from the reflection measurements , which are conducted on the input side of the samples and thus less invasive @xcite .",
    "for example , by reducing reflection , one can couple light into the minimum reflection channel , which corresponds to the maximum transmission channel .",
    "+ the correspondence between transmission and reflection holds only when there is no absorption .",
    "however , absorption exists in many material systems and is known to have a significant impact on the mesoscopic transport of light @xcite .",
    "our recent studies show that when strong absorption is introduced uniformly across a diffusive system , the maximum transmission channel turns into quasi - ballistic @xcite . in case",
    "the absorption is distributed non - uniformly in space , a high transmission channel may redirect the energy flow to circumvent the strong absorbing regions @xcite . because light absorption can also reduce reflection , the minimum reflection channel no longer corresponds to maximum transmission channel @xcite .",
    "usually the optical gain has the opposite effects to the absorption , and there have been extensive studies on the effects of coherent amplification on light propagation in random media @xcite .",
    "however , it is not yet clear how optical amplification would modify the transmission and reflection channels .",
    "intuitively , one would expect both transmittance and reflectance to increase with gain due to light amplification .",
    "such an expectation does not take into account the interference of multiply scattered light , which plays a dominant role in enhancing transmission and suppressing reflection .",
    "as illustrated in the previous studies on the random lasers , coherent amplification can enhance the interference effects in random media , which may lead to unexpected behavior @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper , we present a numerical study to answer the following questions : what is the impact of light amplification on the minimum reflection channel ? is it possible to further reduce reflectance of a strong scattering medium by adding optical gain to it ?",
    "how will the interference effect that underlies the formation of minimum reflection channel be modified by coherent amplification ?",
    "we numerically calculate the minimum reflection channels in disordered waveguides with optical gain .",
    "we find that the minimum reflection channel is formed by destructive interference of quasi - normal modes at the front surface of the random system . in most of the disordered waveguide configurations , adding gain to the system",
    "causes the reflectance to increase , but the increment can be slowed down by adjusting the input wavefront to enhance the destructive interference effect . in some of the disordered waveguides ,",
    "the enhancement of the destructive interference is so strong that the reflectance drops with increasing gain .",
    "this result illustrates that in the random media with gain , the coherent phenomena ( due to interference of excited modes ) may dominate over the incoherent phenomena ( due to growth of mode amplitudes ) .",
    "thus optical gain provides an additional degree of freedom for coherent control of mesoscopic transport of light . + this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents our numerical model of two - dimensional ( 2d ) disordered waveguides with gain . in section iii",

    "the wavelength of the input light is chosen to be away from the mie resonances of individual cylinders , so that the scattering properties of the random system do not vary strongly with frequency .",
    "the incident light enters the waveguide from an open end and is scattered by the cylinders in the @xmath8-@xmath9 plane .",
    "the light transmitted through or reflected from the random array is absorbed by the perfectly - matched - layers located at both ends of the waveguide .",

    "thus the transport displays a large fluctuation from one random configuration to another . within the same statistical ensemble",
    "there are random realizations that are closer to or further away from the localization transition .",
    "this allows us to study the diverse behavior in the same ensemble .",
    "+ usually optical gain exists either inside the scattering particles or in the background material that hosts the particles .",
    "the contrast in the imaginary part of the refractive index causes additional scattering @xcite , which is avoided here by introducing gain to both the scatterers and the host material .",
    "more specifically , the optical gain is introduced uniformly across the scattering region [ highlighted in fig .",

    "<S> we present a numerical study on the minimum reflection channel in a disordered waveguide and its modification by coherent amplification of light . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum reflection channel is formed by destructive interference of quasi - normal modes at the front surface of the random medium . while the lowest reflection eigenvalue increases with gain in most random realizations , the minimum reflection channel can adjust its modal composition to enhance the destructive interference and slow down the growth of reflectance with gain . </S>",
    "<S> some of the random realizations display a further reduction of the minimum reflectance by adding optical gain . </S>",
    "<S> the differential amplification of the modes can make their destructive interference so effective that it dominates over the amplitude growth of the modes , causing the reflectance to drop with gain . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the interplay between interference and amplification makes it possible to further minimize light reflection from a strong scattering medium by introducing optical gain . </S>"
