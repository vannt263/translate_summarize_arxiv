    "the accurate prediction of gravitational waveforms produced in the collisions of black holes has become a central topic of research in general relativity , due to their potential observability with modern interferometric gravitational wave detectors . given the lack of symmetries in a collision ,",
    "it was believed for a long time that only a full numerical integration of the einstein equations would lead to reliable answers .",
    "recently it has been noticed @xcite that one can make some progress in understanding the collisions by using black hole perturbation theory , especially for collisions in which the holes start sufficiently close to each other for the collision to be considered to be the evolution of a single , distorted black hole . following this approach ,",
    "called the `` close limit approximation , '' linearized perturbation theory has been shown to provide a remarkably accurate picture of the head - on collision of momentarily stationary @xcite and boosted black holes @xcite .",
    "if this technique is going to be considered a valid method for cases in which full numerical simulations are still not available , one needs to develop indicators for deciding when the approximation is trustworthy .",
    "intuitive rules of thumb , such as requiring that a single , almost spherical , horizon initially surround both holes turn out to be too conservative to be practical , as was demonstrated by the momentarily - stationary head - on collision results @xcite . recently",
    "@xcite , it was suggested that the use of second order perturbation theory to provide `` error bars '' could be an effective way of estimating the domain of validity of the first order results . for the head - on collision of momentarily stationary black holes the proposal appeared to work very well @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore the application of second order calculations to an important case of initial data that is not momentarily stationary , the head on collision of initially `` boosted '' ( i.e. , moving ) holes .",
    "the introduction of boost turns out to add several technical and conceptual complications .",
    "these are important beyond their relevance to the specific collision studied here , since the cases of realistic physical interest ( collisions with spin and net angular momentum ) all involve initial data that is not momentarily stationary .",
    "this paper will therefore attempt to lay part of the groundwork for future investigations of more realistic situations @xcite .",
    "one of the conclusions of paper will be that perturbative calculations can be a very reliable tool to get quantitative predictions at a certain level of accuracy . if we wish to push the accuracy to a few percent level , some questions remain .",
    "this is in part due to the fact that numerical codes we use for comparison can not at present be trusted to that level of accuracy either , and in part due to several technical complications that appear in perturbation theory .",
    "it is remarkable , however , that the addition of considerable amounts of boost to the black holes does not preclude the applicability of perturbation theory techniques .",
    "this paper is closely related to two previous studies to which reference will frequently be made .",
    "the first is the linearized analysis for initially boosted holes , by baker _",
    "et al._@xcite ; we shall refer to this as baabrps .",
    "the present work relies heavily on the second order formalism described in refs.(@xcite ) , which we shall refer to collectively as gnpp .    in the present paper , sec .",
    "ii gives the details of how our initial data is parameterized with a separation @xmath0 between the holes , and a momentum parameter @xmath1 .",
    "a discussion is given of the meaning of perturbation theory in a two parameter space of solutions .",
    "it is also pointed out that a feature of our initial data differs from that used in computations with numerical relativity , and this difference hinders a perfect comparison of results .",
    "we find , in this section , that to use the second order formalism of gnpp , we must make gauge transformations that eliminate the first order monopole perturbation of the extrinsic curvature .",
    "this is the first of several technical issues that were not evident in the linearized work of baabrps or the momentarily stationary data of gnpp .",
    "section iii shows how the initial data is evolved with a wave equation that has the structure of a zerilli@xcite equation with a source term quadratic in the first order perturbations . from these results ,",
    "it is shown how one computes the gravitational waveforms and energies correct to second order , and the second - order correct results are presented and are compared with results from numerical relativity . in this section",
    "a discussion is given of a second order technical detail that has previously been ignored and that was of little consequence in the evolution of momentarily stationary initial data .",
    "the gauge fixing used in gnpp leaves unfixed a degree of freedom associated with time translations .",
    "this is not relevant to the computation of radiated energy , but must be resolved if our waveforms are to be compared with those of numerical relativity . in sec.iii",
    "a convenient method is given for fixing this gauge freedom in the waveforms .",
    "with this choice , the second order correct waveforms as well as energies are found to be in excellent agreement with the results of numerical relativity .    the methods and results of the paper are briefly reviewed in sec.iv and the connection to future work is pointed out .",
    "we use for the most part notation introduced in baabrps and gnpp , which in turn is based on the notation of regge and wheeler@xcite .",
    "in addition , we will use here the convention of adding superscripts in parentheses _ when necessary _ to indicate whether a quantity is first or second order , and to indicate what multipole it refers to .",
    "multipole indices will be distinguished with `` @xmath2 . ''",
    "thus , for example , @xmath3 would indicate the third order quadrupole regge - wheeler perturbation @xmath4 .",
    "the momentarily - stationary misner @xcite initial solution to the initial value problem of general relativity for a two black hole situation has a convenient explicit analytical form ; for initially moving holes no such form is available and the first step in the problem is to find an appropriate initial value solution .",
    "we use the conformal approach ( see @xcite and references therein ) , in which one assumes the metric to be conformally flat @xmath5 and constructs the conformal extrinsic curvature @xmath6 . in terms of these variables the initial value constraint equations ( assuming maximal slicing @xmath7 ) read , @xmath8 where all the derivatives are with respect to flat space .",
    "one can construct @xcite solutions to the first set of equations ( momentum constraint ) for a single black hole with linear momentum , @xmath9\\ .",
    "\\label{boyok}\\ ] ] here @xmath10 is the distance , in the conformally related flat space , from the origin and @xmath11 is a vector in that space and can be shown to be the momentum of the hole in the asymptotically flat physical space . by superposing two such solutions one obtains the conformally related extrinsic curvature representing two moving black holes ( although the flat space vectors @xmath11 in this case must be considered parameters that have a clear interpretation as momentum only in the case that the holes are widely separated ) . since the constraint equation ( [ momcons ] ) for the conformally related extrinsic curvature is linear",
    ", the superposition still solves the constraint .",
    "as was done in baabrps , we locate the two black holes on the @xmath12 axis of the conformally related flat space , at positions @xmath13 and we choose the flat space vectors @xmath11 to be symmetrically directed towards the origin and to have equal size @xmath1 .",
    "( the case of holes moving away from the origin is represented with a negative value of @xmath1 . )    as in baabrps , we treat the separation parameter @xmath0 as our perturbation parameter , and we expand the two - hole superposed @xmath14 in @xmath0 . due to the equal mass / opposite momentum symmetry ,",
    "only odd powers of @xmath0 appear , and the first two terms are : @xmath15\\\\ & + & { 3 p l^3 \\over 16 r^5 } \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } 2 ( 1 - 18 \\cos^2 \\theta + 25 \\cos^4 \\theta ) & 4 r \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta ( -1 + 5 \\cos^2 \\theta)&0\\\\ 4 r \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta ( -1 + 5 \\cos^2 \\theta ) & r^2 ( 1 + 6\\cos^2 \\theta-15\\cos^4 \\theta)&0\\\\ 0&0&r^2 ( -3 + 33 \\cos^2 \\theta -65 \\cos^4 \\theta + 35 \\cos^6 \\theta ) \\end{array}\\right]\\nonumber.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath16 is the flat space distance to the origin , related to the flat space distance @xmath17 to the holes by @xmath18 , and the expressions in eq.([kapprox ] ) are valid only for @xmath19 .",
    "one must now put this solution in the right hand side of the hamiltonian constraint ( [ hamil ] ) and solve the resulting nonlinear elliptic equation . in this process",
    "one needs to decide which boundary conditions to impose for the elliptic problem .",
    "a common choice in numerical studies has been the use of symmetrization of the data through the two throats of the black holes ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this kind of procedure is not very convenient if one is interested in semi - analytic work as we are , chiefly because symmetrizing implies using the method of images an infinite number of times and the expressions involved become quite large and difficult to handle . on the other hand",
    ", nothing prevents one from constructing unsymmetrized data for boosted black holes along the same lines as for the momentarily - stationary case ( the brill  lindquist problem @xcite ) .",
    "this was recently emphasized by brgmann and brandt @xcite .",
    "here we will take this latter approach .",
    "this is not completely inconsequential , since the only numerical simulations available for comparison are for symmetrized data ; we will return to this point later . to generalize the brill ",
    "lindquist construction to the case with momentum , one assumes the conformal factor to be composed of two pieces , @xmath20 one piece @xmath21 is singular at the points @xmath22 in flat space , and represents throats .",
    "that is , when one introduces a new radial coordinate of the form @xmath23 the `` singular point '' @xmath22 of the conformally related flat space is seen to have the actual geometry of space that is asymptotically flat as @xmath24 .",
    "the result of putting eqs .",
    "( [ twopiece ] ) and ( [ blpiece ] ) in ( [ hamil ] ) is @xmath25 which is to be solved for @xmath26 with the boundary conditions that @xmath26 is regular at @xmath22 and approaches unity as @xmath27 .",
    "notice that the right hand side of eq.([hamforphireg ] ) is well behaved at @xmath22 ; although the numerator diverges as @xmath28 , the denominator increases as @xmath29 .",
    "the main difference between our approach and that of brandt and brgmann @xcite is that we shall solve the initial value problem perturbatively .",
    "we have defined a two parameter ( @xmath1 and @xmath0 ) family of initial data that we could evolve into a two parameter family of spacetimes .",
    "we are , of course , primarily interested in the close limit , the limit of small initial separation , and hence of small @xmath0 . in principle",
    ", we could use initial data correct to second order in @xmath0 .",
    "this would mean solving eq.([hamforphireg ] ) for @xmath26 and expanding the solution in @xmath0 .",
    "in practice , eq.([hamforphireg ] ) would require numerical solution since the right hand side of eq.([hamforphireg ] ) is regular , and the green function for the equation is simple , this would present no significant obstacle , but it would have the disadvantage that we would have the solution only numerically .",
    "in particular , this would mean that the dependence on @xmath1 would not be transparent .",
    "for that reason , we follow a different path . as in baabrps",
    ", we consider small @xmath1 and small @xmath0 .",
    "more specifically , we consider a @xmath30 curve in the family of spacetimes , with @xmath31 a numerical factor of order one .",
    "this means , for example , that terms proportional to @xmath32 and @xmath33 are all of the same order , and are our lowest order perturbations .",
    "our second order perturbations will be of the form @xmath34 . due to",
    "the symmetry of our configuration , no terms arise of order @xmath35 .",
    "since @xmath14 has a leading factor of @xmath1 , the numerator on the right hand side of ( [ hamil ] ) is proportional to @xmath36 .",
    "this point is rather subtle , and there is a temptation to come to a wrong conclusion .",
    "the expressions in ( [ kapprox ] ) are @xmath37 and suggest that the numerator in ( [ hamil ] ) is @xmath38 .",
    "it must be understood , however , that the expressions in ( [ kapprox ] ) are valid only for @xmath39 .",
    "the solution of ( [ hamil ] ) does not depend locally only on the large @xmath16 form of the right hand side .",
    "it connects boundary conditions at infinity with boundary conditions of the throats , boundary conditions for which the @xmath39 condition does not hold . due to this non - locality in ( [ hamil ] ) , or equivalently ( [ hamforphireg ] ) , the conformal factor depends in a complicated , nonpolynomial , way on the @xmath1 parameter .",
    "our `` small @xmath1 '' assumption amounts to taking the numerator in ( [ hamil ] ) , or equivalently ( [ hamforphireg ] ) , to be perturbative , at all points in space .",
    "this , and closely related issues , are further discussed in baabrps .",
    "the perturbative problem requires at several points the specification of a `` mass '' , either of the spacetime or of the black holes .",
    "let us discuss this in some detail .",
    "first , there is the problem of what mass does one use for the background schwarzschild spacetime around which we are doing perturbation theory .",
    "our experience shows that one should use the adm mass of the spacetime .",
    "we saw a similar situation when we analyzed the radiation generated as an initially conformally flat ( `` bowen - york''@xcite ) spinning hole@xcite settles into its kerr final state .",
    "the spin rate was taken to be small , and the problem was treated as a perturbation away from the schwarzschild geometry . for apparently moderate amounts of spin ,",
    "the radiation generated was rather small , but the effect on the adm mass ( i.e. , the spin dependent increase over the schwarzschild mass ) could be a factor of several . by computing exactly the effect of spin on the adm mass",
    ", we found we could successfully apply perturbation theory for moderate spin.the only question could be if one uses that of the initial slice or that after the radiation has gone out , but for the cases of interest the difference is less than @xmath40 , so we will consider the adm mass of the initial slice for our background .",
    "then there is the issue of the initial data .",
    "the initial data for boosted black holes is characterized by the separation @xmath0 , the momentum @xmath1 and a `` bare '' mass for each hole @xmath41 , which also serves as overall scale factor .",
    "this mass has no clear physical meaning , and no equivalent in the reflection symmetric initial data used in numerical relativity .",
    "because of this , we would prefer to have the initial data parameterized by @xmath42 .",
    "since @xmath43 and @xmath41 determine uniquely the adm mass , this is formally no problem . in practice",
    "we proceed in the following way .",
    "the adm mass ( for a given set of parameters @xmath44 ) can be found from the monopole part of our second order solution for the conformal factor @xcite .",
    "one can then write an expansion for @xmath41 of the form , @xmath45 with @xmath46 a constant .",
    "one can then take the intial data , @xmath47 and rewrite it as @xmath48 and use the above expansion ( [ expanmadm ] ) for the explicit form of @xmath49 . as a result of this reparameterization ,",
    "the first and second order terms of the initial data are left invariant .",
    "that is , one simply takes the initial data and where it read `` @xmath50 '' one replaces @xmath51 . for the second order pieces this is also true , the second order pieces of ( [ expanmadm ] )",
    "only contribute irrelevant @xmath52 terms to second order and do not change the initial data . summarizing ,",
    "we construct the perturbative initial data , and wherever it said @xmath41 we replace @xmath53 and this is consistent to the order of perturbation theory we are considering .",
    "therefore our problem is completely parameterized now by the adm mass , which also facilitates comparison with the full numerical data , which are also parameterized and normalized by the adm mass .",
    "this issue was the source of significant confusion in this area initially .",
    "in particular , the results of @xcite are not properly normalized and therefore depart from our predictions in this paper for moderate and large values of the momentum ( when @xmath51 starts to differ significantly from twice the `` bare mass '' of the holes ) .",
    "the concrete details of computation start with ( [ hamforphireg ] ) .",
    "for @xmath39 and for computations only to second order , one needs only the portion linear in @xmath0 of the extrinsic curvature . keeping terms only to second order , and taking on the right hand side of the hamiltonian constraint , the form of @xmath54 given in ( [ blpiece ] ) ,",
    "one gets the @xmath55 piece of the conformal factor , @xmath56 by solving , @xmath57 with the boundary condition @xmath58 at @xmath59 .",
    "we can simplify the solution of this poisson equation by decomposing the source into multipoles : @xmath60 the solution for the monopole and quadrupole parts are : @xmath61 one can also solve for the @xmath62 piece but we will not need it .",
    "the solution contains two constants @xmath63 and @xmath64 representing the homogeneous solution of the poisson equation .",
    "these constants determine , in effect , what boundary conditions are being chosen for the conformal factor .",
    "the choice we have made is that @xmath65 , and hence @xmath66 , is regular everywhere .",
    "the wrong choice of @xmath63 or @xmath64 means that when the solutions in ( [ phis ] ) are continued to @xmath67 they will be singular , so that @xmath54 does not contain all the information about the singularities .",
    "( this would be the case , for instance , if we took @xmath63 and @xmath64 to have the values for the symmetrized solution . )    to determine what values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 give a regular solution , we start by noticing that from ( [ phis ] ) we can see that the asymptotic form of the conformal factor is , @xmath68    on the other hand , we know that the regular part of the conformal factor admits an expansion of the form , @xmath69 since the right hand side of ( [ hamforphireg ] ) falls off as @xmath70 one can conclude that the first three coefficients of the above expansion are part of the homogeneous solution , and have the form @xmath71 we therefore see that @xmath63 and @xmath64 are just the leading coefficients in an expansion of @xmath72 and @xmath73 in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "one can obtain a closed form expression for @xmath72 and @xmath73 by applying gauss theorem to ( [ hamforphireg ] ) , and using the fact that ( by choice ) @xmath26 is regular on the whole @xmath74 plane @xmath75 .",
    "this takes the form @xmath76 where @xmath77 represents the right hand side of ( [ hamforphireg ] ) , and the integral on the left is evaluated over the boundary of the plane at infinity .",
    "it is clear that the only term that contributes to this integral is the leading term for the expansion of @xmath78 .",
    "from there we can therefore determine @xmath72 .",
    "considering the same construction , now for @xmath79 one can determine @xmath73 .",
    "the results are , @xmath80 so therefore for the leading terms we get , @xmath81 \\right|_{p=0,l=0 } \\label{quspert}\\\\ q_2 & = & -{1\\over 8 } { \\partial^4\\over \\partial p^2 \\partial l^2 } \\left .",

    "the integrals ( [ quspert ] ) however , can not be solved in closed form .",
    "instead they were computed numerically ( in several different ways ) .",
    "the numerical treatment of @xmath77 requires some care . as pointed out near the end of sec.iib ,",
    "though the source term is regular , both the numerator and denominator on the right hand side diverge at the points representing the holes .",
    "the results we get for the constants are @xmath86 these numbers are in excellent agreement with an approximate calculation due to brandt and brgmann @xcite .",
    "they obtain approximately the correction of the adm mass due to the momentum in the initial data .",
    "the leading term in the expansion in @xmath0 of their formula is precisely our @xmath63 .",
    "their result is @xmath87 .",
    "one can reproduce these formulas by considering expansions of the integrals considered in powers of @xmath0 .      having the initial data for the problem , we now can input it into the perturbation formalism and evolve it .",
    "the first order perturbations are evolved with a zerilli equation .",
    "the second order perturbations are evolved with a zerilli equation with a `` source '' term quadratic in first order perturbations .",
    "the details of how this is done for the momentarily stationary misner@xcite initial data was described in gnpp .",
    "those details , however , were rather specific to the misner case .",
    "in particular , the formalism in that work used the fact that in the misner initial metric the only first order perturbations are quadrupolar , and hence the source in the second order zerilli equation is constructed entirely from @xmath88 first order perturbations .",
    "those details also assumed that certain of the second order initial metric perturbations vanished .",
    "it will be convenient to use gauge transformations to satisfy these same conditions , so that the previous formalism can be used .",
    "the initial metric ( because it is conformally flat ) has the correct misner - like second order form .",
    "the extrinsic curvature , however , has a first order @xmath52 perturbation which generates @xmath52 perturbations in the evolved data .",
    "these @xmath52 perturbations would contribute to the source term of the second order zerilli equation .",
    "below we will use a first order gauge transformation to eliminate this first order perturbation .",
    "this transformation , however , changes the second order initial metric , taking it out of `` misner form . ''",

    "the numerical simulations correspond to the 1960 misner@xcite initial data , and our results correspond to the brill - lindquist @xcite initial data .    for the range of separations we are going to discuss the discrepancies between these two types of data are insignificant .",

    "we have also modified the potsdam / ncsa / washu code to run for unsymmetrized data , and for limited tests the results agree very well with the symmetrized ones in the range we are considering .",
    "this situation arose due to historical reasons : the numerical code was written before our work with non - symmetrized boundary conditions , whereas perturbation theory becomes very cumbersome if one starts carrying around the extra terms due to symmetrization .",
    "one particular problem that one faces when comparing brill  lindquist ( unsymmetrized ) and symmetrized data sets is that the sets are parameterized in different ways .",
    "there is therefore ambiguity in how to compare the results .",

    ". the `` best '' identification between symmetrized and unsymmetrized data could probably be a @xmath1-dependent notion .",
    "we will ignore this issue here , but it clearly requires further study .      in the formalism of gnpp we chose to fix the coordinates by requiring that the metric be in the regge - wheeler@xcite gauge to first and second order .",
    "this can always be done , but it turns out that the coordinates are not quite uniquely fixed .",
    "the problem is quite generic and it has to do with how perturbation theory handles time translations in situations where the background spacetime is time - translation invariant . consider an exact quantity @xmath137 approximated by a perturbative series expansion , @xmath138 and perform now a first order gauge transformation corresponding to a pure time translation , @xmath139 with @xmath140 a constant , independent of @xmath102 and @xmath10 . replacing @xmath141 by the above expression ( and noticing that @xmath142 ) , we get @xmath143 so we see that the `` second order term '' in the expansion of the metric depends on the origin chosen for time . if one starts with perturbations in the regge - wheeler gauge , a transformation of type ( [ ttrans ] ) leaves the perturbations in the regge - wheeler gauge , but the second - order metric is changed , and in fact depends on an _ arbitrary _ constant @xmath140 .",
    "this indicates that a comparison of quantities to second order in perturbation theory around stationary backgrounds can be quite misleading : the same metric can have very different second order terms depending on the origin of time chosen .",
    "worse , these terms can be quite large , and are completely artificial .",
    "it is interesting to notice that if one computes the radiated energies using the formula we discussed previously ( [ power ] ) , the results are unchanged as expected by time translations ( the additional term turns out to be a total derivative that does not affect the computation of energies ) .",
    "but we want to go beyond giving perturbative results for radiated energy .",
    "we want also to compare perturbative waveforms with those of numerical relativity . since these waveforms are second - order correct quantities given as a function of time at a particular `` observation '' radius , we must be sure that we are using the same zero of time for both waveforms , that from perturbation theory and that computed with numerical relativity .    fortunately , it is not difficult to eliminate the time - shift ambiguity in the metric . to do this",
    "we separate the waveform @xmath137 given in ( [ waveform ] ) into first and second order parts @xmath144 and @xmath145 and we construct the quantity @xmath146 ^ 2}\\ .\\ ] ] we then perform the time translation @xmath147 , arriving at the `` physical '' value for the second order waveform @xmath148 equivalently , we adjust the zero of time , and hence @xmath149 until the integral in the numerator of ( [ c0eq ] ) vanishes .",
    "the same coordinate fixing must be done to the numerically computed waveform @xmath150 . to do this",
    "we define @xmath151 to be @xmath152 .",
    "we then adjust the zero of time so that the integral of @xmath153 vanishes .",
    "these observations about time - shifts are also true in the time ",
    "symmetric case .",
    "we have recomputed the results of @xcite with the zero of time fixed as above and have found that the results are changed by less than @xmath40 . for boosted black holes , on the other hand ,",
    "this time fixing is crucial for seeing the high accuracy agreement of the perturbative and numerical relativity results .",
    "we start to summarize our results by computing the radiated energy as a function of momentum for head - on collisions of black holes released from a separation of @xmath154 , @xmath155 .",
    "the results are depicted in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the figure shows the characteristic `` dip '' at low values of the momentum that was first noticed in baabrps .",
    "an important difference between that paper and the present results is that here , as explained in sec.iic , we are normalizing both the numerical and the perturbative results using the same adm mass .",
    "this leads to a much better agreement for large values of the momentum than that observed in baabrps . as an example of the size of the difference , for @xmath156 , @xmath157 and for @xmath158 , @xmath159 .",
    "a remarkable fact is that first order perturbation theory agrees very well even for large values of the momentum , and second order perturbation theory confirms this fact .",
    "this at first seems puzzling since our initial data was obtained through a `` slow '' approximation in which the momentum was assumed to be small .",
    "however , as was observed in baabrps , for large values of the momentum the initial data is `` momentum dominated '' , meaning that the extrinsic curvature completely dominates the initial data .",
    "therefore the errors made in computing the conformal factor via the slow approximation become less relevant than might be supposed .",
    "the overall picture of the energy therefore is very encouraging , the approximations presented seem to be working even beyond their expected realm , and second order perturbation theory is capable of tracking this fact , playing the expected role of `` error bars . ''",
    "this approach is not without pitfalls , however . in order to illustrate these",
    ", we turn to fig.[fig2 ] , which shows a close up look at the energy picture and also includes results for black holes initially boosted _ away from each other_.    the first thing we notice is , that for black holes boosted away from each other there is , as expected , no `` dip '' in the energy .",
    "the dip is a first order effect that is due to a cancellation between terms that are momentum independent and terms that are linear in momentum .",
    "the cancellation turns to addition in the case of negative ( outwards ) @xmath1 .",
    "we also see that first order calculations are less accurate at the dip than at higher values of the momentum .",
    "this is somewhat puzzling since our approximation should work better the smaller the momentum .",
    "what seems to be happening is that first order theory does not accurately reproduce the higher order terms that make important contributions to the energy after the leading terms cancel in order to produce the dip .",
    "this is confirmed by the fact that first plus second order results are indeed very accurate at the dip",
    ".    an instructive feature of these results is that for black holes boosted away from each other a cancellation of the second order terms takes place around @xmath160 , @xmath161 .",
    "clearly one can not regard second order perturbation theory as giving error bars when it is cancelling out .",
    "moreover , it shows that second order results _ beyond _ that value of @xmath1 can only be taken as rough indicators .",
    "we will return to this cancellation in somewhat more detail in connection with waveforms .",
    "another issue to be mentioned is how crucial it is to have chosen the @xmath162 mass of the initial slice as the mass of the background spacetime used in the perturbative calculations .",
    "our previous ( first - order ) work on boosted black holes used the `` bare '' mass ( adm mass for @xmath85 ) for the background .",
    "this is quite visible if one compares fig.[fig1 ] with fig.2 of baabrps . in the latter",
    ", first order perturbation results appeared to disagree with the numerical results by over an order of magnitude for @xmath158 .",
    "that was entirely due to the poor choice of background mass . in the present paper , using the numerically computed adm mass of the initial data , we see that first ( and second ) order results differ by only @xmath163 from the numerical results at @xmath158 .",
    "let us now turn to the examination of waveforms .",
    "the numerical code of the potsdam / ncsa / washu group extracts waveforms at slightly different values of the radial variable for varying @xmath1 s .",
    "we took this effect into account and extracted perturbative waveforms at the same radii as was used for the numerical relativity work . in all cases",
    "the full numerical code has a very limited range of spacetime covered in the evolution .",
    "this forces the extraction to be done in a rather small range of radii around @xmath164 or so . with perturbation calculations",
    "we could have extracted much further away , but we performed the extraction at exactly the same radius as those used by the numerical code .",
    "waveforms were observed to change shape rather significantly from one extraction radius to another even in such a close range , but we observed that as long as we extracted the perturbative waveform at the same radius as the full numerical result ( as opposed to , say , extracting farther out and then shifting the result back ) the agreement was roughly independent of extraction radius .",
    "however , this starts to hint at a main problem in comparing waveforms : one needs not only to match amplitudes but it is also crucial to match the phase , at least if one is interested in high accuracy . the phase is determined by , among other things , the extraction radius . determining the extraction radius , in turn , requires knowing the adm mass ( since one measures radii in units of adm mass ) .",
    "our full numerical code for computing the adm mass , in its present implementation , is accurate to a few percent .",
    "( this could be made better with more computer power than what is presently available to us ; the runs we made had 300 radial zones and 30 angular zones . )",
    "this limits the accuracy with which we know the adm mass , and hence the accuracy with which we can determine the phases .",
    "the technique , discussed in sec.iiib , of fixing the zero of time is helpful in giving an objective way of comparing phases .",
    "let us turn to the results .",
    "we present , below , the results for the waveform @xmath137 as defined in ( [ waveform ] ) .",
    "this is directly comparable ( up to a time derivative ) with the output of the full numerical relativity code , which outputs a zerilli@xcite function via the radiation extraction technique of assuming that the spacetime is a perturbation of schwarzschild and reading off the perturbations from the full numerical results .",
    "our presentation of waveform comparisons starts with the most disfavorable cases and moves to more favorable ones .",
    "figure [ fig3a ] shows the comparison of waveforms for @xmath165 , @xmath166 and fig.[fig3 ] corresponds to @xmath167 , @xmath168 .",
    "as we see , there is very good overall agreement .",
    "notice that ( taking into account the `` time - shift '' gauge fixing discussed above ) our procedure in the end has _ no free parameter _ ,",
    "i.e. , phases and amplitudes are predetermined in all cases , which makes the agreement more remarkable .",
    "if one looks carefully at the curves in the inset , which enlarges the region around the second positive peak , one sees that there are slight phase and amplitude disagreements .",
    "first order results tends to overshoot the waveform , whereas adding the second order correction tends to undershoot .",
    "there are slight differences in shapes as well . for large values of the momentum",
    ", we can take second order predictions as `` error bars '' only .",
    "however , for intermediate values , it is quite clear that first plus second order calculations offer a very accurate prediction of the waveforms .",
    "the reader should exercise care when comparing the results for waveforms with those of energies .",
    "this is due to a peculiarity of the formula for the radiated power ( [ power ] ) .",
    "as discussed in gnpp , the square that appears in ( [ power ] ) involves terms that are of `` third order '' in perturbation theory .",
    "therefore , to keep things consistent , when squaring the expression in curly braces , we only keep the mixed term and omit the term that is the square of the second order part of @xmath169 . as a consequence , the second order correction for the radiated energy depends mostly on correlations of phases of the first and second order waveforms rather than on their amplitudes . for instance , for the case we are studying @xmath167 , @xmath170 , the second order waveforms are only slightly smaller than the numerical ones , but the computed energy is @xmath171 lower .",
    "we now turn our attention to the area of the dip , @xmath172 , @xmath173 . in fig.[fig5 ] we show the waveforms for the inward boosted case ( the case with a dip in the energy ) .",
    "we see that second order corrections improve the accuracy markedly .",
    "clearly there are strange effects taking place for this value of the parameter .",
    "in particular , it should be noticed how first order theory overshoots the waveforms rather significantly in the second and third positive peak of the waveform , but not in the first one . in view of the fact that the energy is given by the correlation of the first and second order waveforms",
    ", those discrepancies in the first order waveforms would seem to be responsible for the large relative error in the calculation for the energy , even to second order .",
    "this is so , in spite of the fact that second order calculations yield very accurate waveforms .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows the case of @xmath174 ( holes moving initially apart ) .",
    "as could be predicted from the energy plot , a cancellation of the second order terms is taking place . in this case , therefore , one can not regard second order corrections as `` error bars , '' since it is clear that higher order terms are important .",
    "it is worthwhile pointing out that the cancellation is highly nontrivial , the initial data having the same amplitude for both inward and outward momenta .",
    "the cancellation takes place in the evolution , with the source terms of the second order zerilli@xcite equation playing a significant role .    a simple way to understand the cancellation is to break up the evolution into three separate zerilli@xcite equations with three different initial sources , proportional to @xmath175 , @xmath176 , and @xmath177 respectively .",
    "what one sees is that the cancellation occurs between the @xmath176 term and the other two , and clearly depends on the sign of @xmath1 ( for our simulations negative @xmath1 is outward pointing ) .",
    "one can then infer that there is a curve of cancellations in the @xmath1,@xmath0 parameter space that isolates a region in parameter space where second order perturbation theory does not help .",
    "one can not reach points in that region unless one changes the relative counting of powers of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in perturbation theory .",
    "a further study of this issue could therefore yield interesting results .",
    "we have seen that the use of combined first and second order perturbation theory can give excellent results for waveforms and energies of radiation emitted in the head on collision of two equal mass , initially boosted , black holes .",
    "the results show , however , that there are some subtleties , not previously appreciated , in the use of higher order perturbation theory and in the comparison with results from numerical relativity .",
    "the following points deserve attention , especially in connection with the application of higher order perturbation theory to further problems .",
    "\\a ) the comparison of perturbation results and numerical relativity results has pitfalls when comparisons are made between problems that are not identical . in our case",
    "we compared our perturbation result for an `` unsymmetrized '' ( brill - lindquist@xcite type ) initial data , with numerical relativity results for `` symmetrized '' ( misner@xcite type ) initial data .",
    "had we been comparing with unsymmetrized initial data , the parameters @xmath93 for the data sets would have had identical meaning . since the data sets were not identical , a mapping of one parameter set to the other had to be imposed .",
    "one degree of freedom in this mapping was subsumed in the choice to compare cases of equal adm mass , but the remaining element of choice in the mapping is a source of uncertainty in the high accuracy comparisons we are making .",
    "( we emphasize that the choice of mapping was made before any results were considered ; there was no `` fine tuning '' to improve the comparison .",
    "the excellent agreement between the numerical and perturbative results then must be considered to be , among other things , an indication that there is no great sensitivity to the manner in which this mapping of parameters is done . )",
    "\\b ) there is no unique result that is correct to second order .",
    "different ways in which details are handled will produce results that are the same to second order , but differ at higher order .",
    "these different results can have different ranges of validity and can exhibit different accuracy when compared with numerical work near the limit of validity .",
    "one example of this feature of perturbation theory is the dependence on parameterization@xcite . in our perturbative results",
    "we have seen another simple example : the second - order correct waveform consists of a first order and a second order piece . when radiated energy is computed by squaring this waveform",
    "one can choose simply to take the square , or to truncate the result and omit the fourth order contribution arising from the square of the second order contribution to the waveform .",
    "( we have made the latter `` conservative '' choice . ) both results , of course , are equally justifiable for the order of perturbation theory we are doing , but the results are noticeably different .",
    "\\c ) in the present paper we have seen a particularly interesting example of the importance of higher order terms and the detailed way in which perturbation theory is applied . to make the comparison between symmetrized and unsymmetrized initial data we found that it is important to compare cases of equal adm mass , but the adm mass ( for fixed @xmath41 ) varies quickly with increasing initial momentum .",
    "if one computes this momentum dependence perturbatively the agreement of perturbation theory and numerical relativity is limited . with",
    "the adm mass computed exactly ( i.e. , numerically ) the agreement is greatly improved .",
    "this suggests that an _ a priori _ physical understanding of the dependence on the perturbations can be a very useful guide to an efficient perturbation scheme .",
    "\\d ) in addition to the numerical computation of adm mass , another useful new technical detail was developed in the present work .",
    "a method was found of fixing the zero of time in the same manner for both perturbative and numerical waveforms .",
    "this fixing of zero had not been important in previous perturbation studies , but was crucial to comparison of waveforms for initially boosted holes .",
    "\\e ) perturbation analysis in the present paper was carried out for both small separation and small momentum ( `` the close slow limit '' ) .",
    "this makes it particularly difficult to unravel the sources of disagreement with numerical results when anomalous cancellations ( like the `` dip '' ) occur .",
    "although perturbation results end up in excellent agreement with numerical relativity results , a perturbative analysis based on small @xmath0 , but without small @xmath1 ( especially if it could be compared with numerical results for unsymmetrized data ) , might be useful in improving our understanding of the nature of errors .",
    "\\f ) the current state of the art of numerical relativity presents limitations , both in accuracy and in range of simulations of the codes . as a consequence , we were limited to comparing waveforms which are not really in the radiation zone",
    "this is a dangerous exercise when it comes to second order perturbation theory . in particular",
    ", the formula for the radiated power ( from which we extracted the concept of second order waveform ) assumes that one is in the radiation zone .",
    "this is true also of the extraction techniques used in the numerical codes to produce a zerilli@xcite function as output . in short : with the current limitations we can not rule out that the discrepancies we see in waveforms and energies might be within the error margins of the numerical results .",
    "a general conclusion of this work is that the synergy between numerical results and perturbative calculations will probably be one of the major tools that we will have to use to address with any accuracy the problem of the collision of two black holes in general relativity .",
    "we see this taking place right now .",
