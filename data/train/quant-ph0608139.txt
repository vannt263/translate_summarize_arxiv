    "entanglement is one of the most studied topics at present .",
    "the large interest for this issue relies mainly on the fact that entangled systems can be used to perform some tasks more efficiently than classical objects  @xcite .",
    "it is then natural to look for a good understanding of this resource not only from a purely mathematical point of view , _ i.e. _ , formalizing the theory of entanglement , but also from a more practical approach , _",
    "i.e. _ , studying its role and manifestations in realistic systems .",
    "for example , recent works have been able to connect entanglement to thermodynamical properties of macroscopic physical systems  @xcite . in a distinct venue , other works study physical manifestations of quantum correlations by suitably choosing particular purity and entanglement quantifiers and restricting allowed quantum states according to these quantities  @xcite . in these studies , concepts like _",
    "maximally entangled mixed states ( mems ) _ are discussed .",
    "a very recent study also adds energy to entanglement and purity as a third parameter to characterize certain quantum states  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the authors discuss the physically allowed states according to the possible values of entanglement , purity and energy for a system composed of two qubits or two gaussian states , and also study the entanglement transfer between them .    in the present manuscript , we study the connection between entanglement and energy that appears naturally in a swapping process involving two systems of two qubits . in the model investigated , we consider a simple form of interaction between two pairs of qubits labeled as @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the system @xmath6 is prepared in an entangled state while the pair @xmath7 is prepared in a factorable state .",
    "we analyze the dynamical relations between energy and entanglement of qubits @xmath7 when exchanging energy and coherence with qubits @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , for any given time @xmath8 , we calculate the full quantum state of qubits @xmath9 and then we trace out qubits @xmath6 to calculate energy and entanglement of the remaining pair @xmath7 .",
    "we show that this dynamics yields paths in an entanglement - energy diagram , and that these paths are contained in a very restricted region .",
    "moreover , we identify the frontiers of this region from the general form of the density operator that represents the state of the subsystem @xmath7 . we also propose a physical system to realize such entanglement transfer and investigate how the dynamics of the entanglement swapping is modified if the @xmath7 system is open and allowed to dissipate energy to an external reservoir . in some sense , this work is complementary to the sequence @xcite in which the authors study the problem of entanglement transfer from continuous - variable entangled states to qubits , although in those works the authors do not pay particular attention to the relation between energy and entanglement .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ physscen ]",
    "we introduce the general physical system that we will study and the basic setup from which we will approach it .",
    "we also define the quantities that will be analyzed throughout the paper and finally we discuss the dynamics of this system .",
    "section [ enten ] is devoted to study the entanglement and the energy of system @xmath7 under a particular unitary evolution .",
    "we then propose a physical implementation for the studied hamiltonian , and generalize the time evolution in section [ opsys ] by considering the problem of a dissipative , non - unitary evolution . in section [ conc ]",
    "we conclude by reviewing the main points we have discussed and suggesting possible extensions of this study .",
    "let us start by describing the system we are interested in .",
    "suppose a system of four qubits @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 interacting via a spin - exchange like hamiltonian : @xmath10 where    [ hxx ] @xmath11 and @xmath12    for each qubit , the relevant pauli operators are defined by    @xmath13    and the interaction operators like @xmath14 , for example , can be viewed as annihilating an excitation of subsystem @xmath0 and creating an excitation in subsystem @xmath2 .",
    "the constants @xmath15 and @xmath16 give the strength of the interaction between these subsystems .",
    "one important feature in understanding such hamiltonians is that the total number of excitations is a conserved quantity .",
    "the eigenvectors of ( similarly to ) are given by : @xmath17 , with eigenvalue @xmath18 , @xmath19 , with eigenvalue @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , with eigenvalue @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "as the initial state , let us suppose that the entire @xmath9 system is prepared in the form : @xmath24 where @xmath25 , which means that subsystem @xmath7 is prepared in its ground state and subsystem @xmath6 is usually prepared in some entangled state with one excitation ( except if @xmath26 , @xmath27 , when the state is factorable ) .",
    "note that this initial state is pure and it is chosen so that the bipartition @xmath28 does not present any initial entanglement . from now on , we will study the time evolution of this initial state when subjected to hamiltonian   for different coupling constants @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we will concentrate our analysis in the subsystem @xmath7 by tracing out the degrees of freedom of systems @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "another simplifying assumption we made is to consider the complete resonance condition @xmath29 .",
    "a special case of this dynamics happens when @xmath30 , in which case state   evolves into state @xmath31 note that in this simple case , for @xmath32 , with @xmath33 odd , the subsystems exchange their states , the entanglement initially present in subsystem @xmath6 is completely transferred to subsystem @xmath7 and with respect to the bipartition @xmath34 the state becomes again separable .",
    "however , for @xmath35 , the whole system is entangled ( as long as @xmath36 ) and subsystem @xmath7 will be in some mixed state .    in a more general situation ( different coupling constants ) , state   will evolve into : @xmath37\\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sin\\theta[\\cos(g_{bb } t){\\left| 0100 \\right\\rangle}-i\\sin(g_{bb } t){\\left| 0001 \\right\\rangle}]\\label{phi(t)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that for generic times @xmath8 , state   presents , again , multipartite entanglement among all its individual components ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) . studying this multipartite entanglement may also prove intriguing and enlightening .",
    "however this is not the purpose of this manuscript where , as mentioned above , we will concentrate our analysis in the subsystem @xmath7 .",
    "our goal is to investigate the relation between energy and entanglement in subsystem @xmath7 as a function of coupling constants and time . in order to study entanglement",
    "we will use the _ negativity _ ( @xmath38 ) which can be defined for two qubits as two times the modulus of the negative eigenvalue of the partial transposition of the state @xmath39 , @xmath40 @xcite , if it exists . for short : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath40 .",
    "our choice is motivated by the facts that the negativity is easy to calculate and provides full entanglement information for a two - qubit system . for the energy of subsystem @xmath7 , @xmath43",
    ", we will consider the mean value of the relevant restriction of the free hamiltonian : @xmath44 where @xmath45",
    "after tracing out the degrees of freedom of systems @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the global quantum state , the reduced state for the pair @xmath7 is described by : @xmath46 where @xmath47 ( from the normalization of @xmath48 ) , with @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 given by the following functions of the coupling constants and time :    @xmath51    [ elements ]    following eq .",
    ", the energy of state is : @xmath52 which , by means of eqs .",
    ", becomes : @xmath53 note that @xmath54 , which means that there is at most one excitation on the @xmath7 system .",
    "this is expected since the chosen initial state contains only one excitation for the entire @xmath9 system and this set of qubits is isolated , i.e. it can not be excited by external sources .",
    "a simple calculation gives for the entanglement ( negativity ) of state @xmath55      ccc +   +   + &    in fig .",
    "[ figenemt ] we have plotted the temporal behavior of @xmath38 and @xmath43 for several values of the coupling constants @xmath15 and @xmath16 . the entanglement transferring process can be followed in those pictures .",
    "the simplest one is for equal coupling constants @xmath56 , in which the state @xmath57 is cyclically `` bouncing '' between the two pairs of qubits .",
    "the chosen ratios between coupling constants indicate a very important behavior of the system : the complete entanglement transferring process can only happen if @xmath58 for @xmath59 and @xmath33 odd integers .",
    ".   supports this conclusion , since both @xmath60 and @xmath61 must be odd multiples of @xmath62 simultaneously ( remember that @xmath63 and @xmath64 are positive numbers in order to the state @xmath65 to be entangled ) .",
    "the physical picture is that each pair @xmath4 and @xmath5 oscillates inside duplets @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the situation is analogous to two classical harmonic oscillators with distinct frequencies starting from a common extremal point .",
    "the implied relation is necessary for them to meet within an odd number of half oscillations , which is the condition for a complete transfer of state .",
    "to insist in this point , note that for @xmath68 , at time @xmath69 , the pair @xmath4 ( or , more precisely , its analogous oscillator ) has suffered a full oscillation , but the pair @xmath5 ( resp .",
    "its analogous oscillator ) has undergone half an oscillation , so one could found entanglement between @xmath0 and @xmath3 , but no entanglement can be found between any other pair of qubits , including the studied pair @xmath7 .    for other values of @xmath70",
    "we obtain similar pictures , with the only important difference in the entanglement scale , since no maximally entangled pair will be formed .      in this subsection",
    "we use time as a parameter to draw graphics on an entanglement versus energy diagram .",
    "as we will show , the paths followed in this phase diagram exhibit interesting patterns .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     a different phenomenology can be anticipated for the case of non - null temperature . since thermal photons",
    "can now be captured by both cavities , the state @xmath71 will be populated and the form will not be valid anymore .",
    "one consequence is that one can expect the phenomenon known as entanglement sudden death  @xcite , since it will not be necessary to nullify the elements @xmath50 in order to have a positive partial transpose , and hence no entanglement .",
    "in this paper we have addressed the problem of entanglement and energy transfer between pairs of qubits .",
    "we considered the particular example of two atoms interacting with two cavities in the jaynes - cummings model .",
    "this evolution can be seen as a state transferring process and , for specific coupling constants , a dynamical entanglement swapping .",
    "if the atoms are initially in an entangled state , this entanglement is fully or partially transferred to the cavities depending on coupling constants and time .",
    "this entanglement swapping process is accompanied by an energy transfer as well , and we have shown that entanglement and energy in the cavities system are strictly related .    to clarify this relation we studied these quantities in various scenarios .",
    "first we considered the whole system as isolated , and investigated its time evolution for several coupling constants and different initial atomic entanglement . in each case , we traced out the atoms ( as we now refer to the lower case qubits ) , we drew an entanglement vs. energy phase - diagram for the cavity modes and we found an upper - limit for all the possible paths in these diagrams",
    ". this bound corresponds to maximally entangled atoms transferring its entanglement and energy to independent cavities at exactly the same rates .",
    "we also considered the possibility of dissipation in the cavities . in this case , while the atoms are transferring excitations and entanglement to the cavities , some energy is lost to the environment .",
    "the cavities state goes asymptotically to state @xmath72 . in the dissipative regime",
    ", the evolution of entanglement and energy of the cavities state exhibits the same characteristics pointed out for the unitary case , _",
    "i.e. _ , the paths followed in the entanglement - energy diagram are limited to a restricted region whose frontier is identified by the trajectory described when the couplings are identical and the initial entanglement of the atomic state is maximum .",
    "however , as expected , neither entanglement nor energy can be fully transferred unless the dissipative times are much larger than the inverse rabi frequencies involved .",
    "fortunately , this regime is usually achieved in cavity qed experiments .",
    "we only analyzed the entanglement between qubits @xmath7 ( the modes , in the physical realization proposed ) .",
    "however , most of the time the whole system presents multipartite entanglement which may provide interesting new results if further studied .",
    "other important continuations of this work include the treatment of non - completely resonant systems ( _ e.g._@xmath73 , which corresponds to two distinct atoms resonantly coupled to cavity modes , as well as the case of dispersive coupling ) and also other couplings to reservoirs , like including temperature in the scenario here presented and also considering spontaneous decay for the atoms .",
