    "negative index materials ( nims ) were first investigated theoretically by veselago in @xcite .",
    "the existence of such materials was confirmed by shelby , smith , and schultz in @xcite .",
    "the study of nims has attracted a lot attention in the scientific community thanks to their many applications .",
    "one of the appealing ones is cloaking .",
    "there are at least three ways to do cloaking using nims . the first one is based on plasmonic structures introduced by alu and engheta in @xcite .",
    "the second one uses the concept of complementary media .",
    "this was suggested by lai et al . in @xcite and confirmed theoretically in @xcite for inspired schemes .",
    "the last one is based on the concept of alr discovered by milton and nicorovici in @xcite . in this paper , we concentrate on the last method .    cloaking a source via alr was discovered by milton and nicorovici in @xcite .",
    "their work has root from @xcite ( see also @xcite ) where the localized resonance was observed and established for constant symmetric plasmonic structures in the two dimensional quasistatic regime .",
    "more precisely , in @xcite , the authors studied core - shell plasmonic structures in which a circular shell has permittivity @xmath0 while its complement has permittivity 1 where @xmath1 denotes the loss of the material in the shell . instead of @xmath0 ; but this point is not essential . ]",
    "let @xmath2 and @xmath3 be the inner and the outer radius of the shell .",
    "they showed that there is a critical radius @xmath4 such that a dipole is not seen by an observer away from the core - shell structure , hence it is cloaked , if and only if the dipole is within distance @xmath5 of the shell .",
    "moreover , the power @xmath6 of the field @xmath7 , which is defined in , blows up as the loss @xmath1 goes to 0 .",
    "two key features of this phenomenon are : 1 ) the localized resonance , i.e. , the fields blow up in some regions and remain bounded in some others as the loss goes to 0 ; 2 ) the connection between the localized resonance and the blow up of the power as the loss goes to 0 .    cloaking a source via alr has been mainly studied in the quasistatic regime . in @xcite ,",
    "bouchitte and schweizer proved that a small circular inclusion of radius @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 fast enough ) is cloaked by the core - shell plasmonic structure mentioned above in the two dimensional quasistatic regime if the inclusion is located within distance @xmath5 of the shell .",
    "otherwise it is visible .",
    "concerning the second feature of cloaking a source via alr , the blow up of the power was studied for a more general setting in two dimensional quasistatic regime by ammari et al . in @xcite and kohn et al . in @xcite .",
    "more precisely , they considered non - radial core - shell structures in which the shell has permittivity @xmath0 and its complement has permitivity 1 . in @xcite ,",
    "ammari et al .",
    "dealt with arbitrary shells and provided a characterization of sources for which the power blows up via the information of the spectral decomposition of the neumann - poincar type operator . in @xcite , kohn et al .",
    "considered core - shell structures in which the outer boundary of the shell is round but the inner is not and established the blow up of the power for some class of sources using a variational approach .",
    "a connection between the blow up of the power and the localized resonance subtly depends on the geometry and property of plasmonic structures .",
    "it was showed in @xcite that such a connection does not hold in general . cloaking a source via alr in some special three dimensional geometry",
    "was studied in @xcite .",
    "motivated by the concept of reflecting complementary media suggested and studied in @xcite and results mentioned above , in @xcite we studied cloaking a source via alr for a general core shell structure of doubly complementary media property ( see definition  [ def - dcm ] ) in the quasistatic regime .",
    "more precisely , we established the following three properties for doubly complementary media :    * cloaking a source via alr appears if and only if the power blows up . *",
    "the power blows up if the source is located  near \" the shell . *",
    "the power remains bounded if the source is far away from the shell .",
    "using these results , we extended various results mentioned previously .",
    "moreover , we were able to obtain schemes to cloak an arbitrary source concentrating on an arbitrary smooth bounded manifold of codimension 1 placed in an arbitrary medium via alr ; the cloak is independent of the source .",
    "the analysis in @xcite is on one hand based on the reflecting techniques initiated in @xcite , the removing localized technique introduced in @xcite to deal with the localized resonance . on the other hand",
    ", the analysis in @xcite is based on new observations on the cauchy problems and the separation of variables technique for a general shell introduced there .",
    "the implement of this technique is an ad - hoc part of @xcite .    in this paper , we study cloaking a source via alr for the finite frequency regime as a natural continuation of @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we establish properties p1 ) , p2 ) and p3 ) for doubly complementary media in the finite frequency regime . as a consequence ,",
    "we are also able , as in the quasistatic regime , to obtain schemes to cloak * a non generic arbitrary source * concentrating on an * arbitrary smooth bounded manifold of codimension 1 * placed in an * arbitrary medium * via alr ; the cloak is independent of the source ( see section  [ sect - cloaking ] ) . concerning the analysis , we extend ideas from @xcite and add various new insights for the problem which allows us to overcome difficulties related to the finite frequency regime such as the use of the maximum priniciple , to shorten the approach in @xcite , and to obtain new information on the cloaking a source via alr .",
    "in particular , we can characterize the behaviour of the fields far enough from the plasmonic shell as the loss goes to 0 for arbitrary sources in the doubly complementary media setting ( theorem  [ thm - main ] ) .",

    "<S> cloaking a source via anomalous localized resonance ( alr ) was discovered by milton and nicorovici in @xcite . a general setting in which cloaking a source via alr takes place is the settting of doubly complementary media . </S>",

    "<S> , we study cloaking a source via alr for doubly complementary media in the finite frequency regime as a natural continuation of @xcite . we establish the following results : 1 ) cloaking a source via alr appears if and only if the power blows up ; 2 ) the power blows up if the source is  placed \" near the plasmonic structure ; 3 ) the power remains bounded if the source is far away from the plasmonic structure . </S>",
    "<S> concerning the analysis , we extend ideas from @xcite and add new insights on the problem which allows us to overcome difficulties related to the finite frequency regime and to obtain new information on the problem . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we are able to characterize the behaviour of the fields far enough from the plasmonic shell as the loss goes to 0 for an * arbitrary source * outside the core - shell structure in the doubly complementary media setting . </S>"
