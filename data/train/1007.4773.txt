    "we study the confining effects of @xmath13 using the truncated conformal spectrum approach .",
    "as orginally developed @xcite , the tcsa has been used extensively ( for a sample consider @xcite ) .",
    "however here we combine it with a wilsonian renormalization group modeled after the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) used to study quantum impurity problems @xcite . with quantum impurity problems",
    ", the nrg exploits the idea that sites on the kondo lattice far away from the quantum impurity are less important than sites close to the impurity in determining the physics .",
    "we have a similar notion here as the perturbation @xmath13 is relevant in the rg sense ( the anomalous dimension of the operator , @xmath41 , is less than 2 ) and so the eigenstates of the unperturbed hamiltonian , @xmath108 , lowest in energy are most important in determining the physics of the full model . we are thus justified in initially truncating the spectrum of @xmath109 to a finite number of states ( for the computations chosen here , we initially truncate at @xmath110 ) . to be able to do so , we study the theory at finite size , @xmath111 . in making the system finite ,",
    "the spectrum becomes discrete with level spacing @xmath112 .",
    "however even at finite size , the conformal nature of @xmath15 means we have complete control over the spectrum ( which can be thought of as a four - fold tensor product of states coming from hilbert spaces of compactified bosons ) .",
    "the hilbert space of the theory can be described more properly as follows . for a single boson , with compactification radius , r",
    ", the hilbert space is built from a set of highest weight states denoted by @xmath113 where @xmath114 gives the center of mass momentum , @xmath115 , of the state , and @xmath116 denotes the winding number ( or charge ) of the state @xcite .",
    "@xmath113 is related to the true vacuum state , @xmath117 , by @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the boson dual to @xmath120 .",
    "descendant states may be created by acting on the @xmath113 with a set of oscillator modes @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , that come from mode expanding the boson",
    ". for our multibosonic system with bosons , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , the set of highest weight states are formed according to @xmath126 these particular conditions upon the highest weight states may be derived by considering the original bosons that arise in bosonizing the subband fermions ( i.e. before the transformation to the charge and spin bosons ) .",
    "descendant states are again formed by acting on these states with the modes @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath123 , of the bosons .",
    "we note that we can show this hilbert space leads to a modular invariant partition function indicating we have a well defined theory @xcite .",
    "the action of @xmath15 upon a state of the form @xmath129 is @xmath130 where the @xmath131 are the four luttinger parameters .",
    "having described the hilbert space , we now label the discretized spectrum , @xmath132 where the spectrum has been ordered in terms of increasing energy .",
    "we then truncate the spectrum keeping the first @xmath133 states of the unperturbed theory , @xmath134 ( where @xmath135 and @xmath136 were typically chosen for this study ) .",
    "we further exploit our control over the unperturbed theory by computing all the matrix elements of @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath137 .",
    "this knowledge then allows us to represent the full hamiltonian as a @xmath138 matrix which we then diagonalize . if @xmath15 were a simple theory , this procedure would be enough to obtain highly accurate results . in studying the critical transverse field ising model perturbed by a parallel magnetic field , ref .",
    "was able to keep only 39 states and yet still obtain the spectrum of the theory to an accuracy of a few percent .",
    "however a single luttinger liquid can roughly be thought of ( in terms of complexity of the hilbert space ) as a tensor product of two ising models .",
    "thus @xmath139 , being composed of four bosons , can be thought of as equivalent in complexity to a tensor product of eight ising models .",
    "this eight fold complexity means that a simple truncation can no longer hope to describe correctly the physics .",
    "this is where the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) is crucial , which we now briefly describe .",
    "the nrg begins by taking the states arising from the diagonalization of the @xmath138 matrix and ordering them in terms of increasing energy , @xmath140 .",
    "we then discard the top @xmath141 states .",
    "we re - form the truncated hilbert space by taking the lowest @xmath142 energy states remaining from the diagonalization and add to them the next @xmath141 states from the unperturbed spectrum .",
    "we thus obtain a truncated hilbert space of the same size ( @xmath133 ) : latexmath:[$|e^1_1\\rangle,\\cdots,|e^1_n\\rangle ,    the hamiltonian in this new basis , rediagonalize , and then repeat the procedure until convergence . in this way , we allow the high energy portion of the unperturbed spectrum to influence the low energy sector in bite size , numerically manageable ( @xmath141 ) chunks .    in our study of the exciton gaps ,",
    "we typically iterate the nrg up to 70 times ( and so with a @xmath136 , we take into account  @xmath144 states of the unperturbed theory ) . while the results are not completely converged , we allow an analytic rg to take over from the numerical rg . at sufficiently high energies ,",
    "the flow of a gap under the rg is governed by a simple one loop equation @xcite .",
    "we can thus fit the flow equation to our numerical data at high truncation energies and extrapolate to infinite truncation energy .",
    "for single particle gaps however , we found we needed to iterate the nrg many more times than for the excitons . because of the large charge velocity ( at least at small values of @xmath23 ) , we needed to take into account on the order of 1200000 states from the unperturbed theory . if we were to use the nrg as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , this would mean iterating the nrg over 1000 times , a too great of numerical burden ( the computational time scales as the number of iterations to the third power ) .",
    "we have thus adapted the nrg in this case .",
    "the great majority of the 1200000 states that the nrg needs to run through in the single particle case do not influence the end result .",
    "we thus run a preselection of the most important states and run the nrg on those .",
    "this works straightforwardly as follows .",
    "to run the preselection , we run the nrg as initially described for m iterations ( and so account for the first @xmath145 states of the unperturbed theory ) .",
    "we have then obtained a reasonable approximate ( though not yet fully converged ) of the lowest lying eigenstates of the theory .",
    "let us for the sake of specificity focus on the ground state , @xmath146 , obtained after these m - iterations .",
    "rather than blindly run the nrg further , we use these eigenstates to provide a measure of which of the yet to be iterated through states are important .",
    "suppose we want to iterate through a further @xmath147 states .",
    "we first compute their overlap with @xmath146 in second order perturbation theory , i.e. we compute @xmath148 we take the @xmath149 s as a measure of how strongly the state @xmath150 will mix into @xmath151 under the nrg . using this measure , we then throw away states , @xmath150 with @xmath149 below some cutoff , @xmath40 .",
    "we then take the remaining states that have survived this cutoff procedure and run the nrg on those as before .",
    "typically in applying this procedure to the single particle gaps , we have used @xmath152 , @xmath136 , @xmath89 up to @xmath153 , and @xmath154 . after applying the truncation to the @xmath147 states , we were typically left with  70000 states . running through these  70000 states",
    "is then done in several hours rather than the several weeks it would take to run through the original @xmath147 states .    in analyzing the hamiltonian we are careful to minimize the necessary computational burden by respecting the symmetries of the full hamiltonian .",
    "the full hamiltonian possesses a @xmath155 symmetry .",
    "the @xmath156 arises from the ( valley symmetric ) charge degrees of freedom while the @xmath157 governs the flavour degrees of freedom ( composed of valley antisymmetric charge degrees of freedom plus spin degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the hamiltonian also possesses @xmath158 degrees of freedom which arise by transforming 2 of the 4 bosons , @xmath159 , via @xmath160 .",
    "the excitons that are optically active are all @xmath157 scalars and so we run our numerics in this portion of the hilbert space of the full hamiltonian .",
    "similar the single particle excitations transform as a four dimensional representation ( the fundamental under su(4 ) ) while the one branch of dark excitons that we consider ( necessary to understanding the bright exciton spectrum ) transforms as a 15 dimensional representation ( the adjoint of su(4 ) ) .",
    "such large degeneracies of the dark excitons will of course be broken if we consider the full forward scattering and/or include back scattering terms . but these interactions are relatively weak in the dark exciton sector and so the breaking will be comparatively small .      in this section",
    "we give some of the details surrounding the interpretation of the nrg data .",
    "in particular we will give some details on how finite size corrections determine the data analysis .",
    "for @xmath61 and @xmath107 , finite size corrections are large because both of these excitations are near two - exciton thresholds .",
    "but we first turn to the easier of the gaps to determine : @xmath60 , @xmath84 , and @xmath88 .",
    "for specificity we focus on @xmath60 . presented in fig .",
    "4 is @xmath60 as a function of system size , @xmath111 , for two different truncations of the total number of states ( 15000 and 75000 ) .",
    "( these truncations are determined by truncating the system so that the energies of the unperturbed states satisfy @xmath161 and @xmath162 ) .",
    "we see that @xmath60 possesses only a weak dependence on @xmath111 .",
    "this , however still leaves the question of which value of @xmath111 to use for @xmath60 . for small values of @xmath111",
    ", we expect the energies of the full theory to reduce to that of the theory s uv fixed point , i.e. we expect the energies to behave as @xmath163 .",
    "we can see this behaviour beginning already at @xmath164 . for large values of @xmath111",
    "we expect instead a truncation error ( coming from ignoring higher energy states ) of the form @xmath165 .",
    "this error typically leads to an overestimate of the true value of the gap .",
    "the slow increase of @xmath60 that begins at @xmath166 is evidence of this .",
    "given these behaviors ( deviations of @xmath60 from its true value ) , it then makes sense to choose @xmath111 where @xmath60 is at its minimum .",
    "this we do by choosing @xmath167 .",
    "the one cautionary note we make is that at this value of @xmath111 , @xmath60 may still see finite size corrections .",
    "even though @xmath111 is sufficiently large so that theory is far enough away from its uv fixed point , @xmath60 can see corrections related to virtual processes by which the excitation emits a virtual particle which then `` travels around the world '' and is reabsorbed . such processes are suppressed exponentially in @xmath111 leading to small corrections to @xmath60 , i.e. @xmath168 . the coefficient @xmath169 is either equal to @xmath170 where @xmath141 is one of the other gaps in the theory and @xmath171 is its characteristic velocity ( a so - called f - term @xcite ) or it is related to the binding energy associated with thinking of @xmath60 as a bound state of two other excitations ( a so - called @xmath172-term @xcite ) .",
    "however for @xmath60 , @xmath169 ( whether arising from an f - term or a @xmath172-term ) is sufficiently large so that the correction should be small ( it is difficult to make an absolute statement about this as we can not easily estimate the coefficient in front of the exponential which in principle could be large ) . believing it to be small we make no attempt directly to correct our results for this error .",
    "however dealing with finite size errors is necessary in studying the gaps @xmath61 and @xmath107 .",
    "we do however do a renormalization group improvement ( rgi ) of our numerical data by taking into account the rg flow that is occurring at fixed @xmath111 .",
    "we see that as we increase the cutoff energy , @xmath173 , the value of @xmath60 flows to smaller values .",
    "this flow , at lowest order , is governed by the equation @xmath174 where @xmath50 here is a function of the anomalous dimension of @xmath13 and @xmath175 .",
    "integrating this equation , we can express the value of the gap at finite truncation energy to the gap at infinite truncation energy : @xmath176 where @xmath177 is some constant .",
    "we thus can use the data for two different values of @xmath173 to estimate @xmath177 and so extract the value of @xmath60 without cutoff .",
    "the results of doing so are plotted in fig .",
    "4 as @xmath178 .    to arrive at the value of",
    "@xmath60 actually reported in fig . 2 of the manuscript",
    ", we assume the rg improved value represents an upper bound to the value of @xmath60 while the value of @xmath60 at @xmath179 represents a lower bound .",
    "it is then the average of these two values that is reported with the error bar being 1/2 the difference .    while @xmath60 does not suffer from significant finite size corrections",
    ", @xmath61 does .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "5 @xmath61 as a function of @xmath111 .",
    "we see that unlike @xmath60 , @xmath61 steadily increases as a function of @xmath111 .",
    "we understand this to be a consequence of @xmath61 being a bound state of either two dark excitons , @xmath88 , or two one - photon excitons , @xmath60 , and that furthermore lies just below these two exciton thresholds , i.e @xmath61 is only slightly less than @xmath91 or @xmath180 . in such circumstances",
    "strong finite size corrections are expected .",
    "these corrections take the form @xmath181 where again @xmath169 is related to the binding energy of the exciton .",
    "if @xmath61 is a bound state of the two dark excitons , @xmath169 is given by @xmath182 where @xmath10 appears because the velocity of the dark excitons is very close to @xmath10 as they lie almost entirely in the spin / flavour sector of the theory .",
    "if instead @xmath61 is a bound state of two @xmath60 , we have instead @xmath183 where @xmath184 here is approximately @xmath92 but will not be exactly that as the exciton @xmath60 is influenced by both the charge and spin sectors of the theory .",
    "thus if @xmath61 is close to either of the two exciton thresholds ( or if @xmath184 is large which it likely is ) , @xmath169 will be small and the finite size corrections , even though exponential , will decay only slowly as @xmath111 grows .    to estimate @xmath61",
    ", we assume the data to have the form @xmath185 .",
    "fitting the data to this form allows us to estimate @xmath186 .",
    "we take this as an upper bound on the value of @xmath186 as we expect that at larger @xmath111 , @xmath61 is overestimated in the numerical data because of a finite cutoff , @xmath173 . to find a lower bound , we examine @xmath61 as a function of momentum .",
    "plotted in fig .",
    "5 is the numerical data for @xmath187 where the momentum @xmath188 is related to @xmath111 via @xmath112 . where @xmath187 and @xmath189 meet then serves as a lower bound for @xmath61 .",
    "( incidentally the manner of this crossing indicates that the dispersion of @xmath61 at small momenta is hole - like , i.e. @xmath190 . ) the value for @xmath61 that we plot in fig .",
    "5 of the manuscript is an average of these upper and lower bounds , while we take as an uncertainty 1/2 the difference of the two ."

    "<S> its computation therefore requires a non - perturbative approach .    </S>",

    "<S> this approach has been particularly valuable in that it has allowed a quantitative description of aspects of excitonic physics , in particular the magnitude of the excitonic gap for the lowest lying excitons in a given subband of the nanotube . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we step away from trying to describe quantitative details of the excitons and instead focus on more qualitative features . </S>",
    "<S> we do so using an approach that combines a field theoretic reduction of the nanotubes identical to that used to study luttinger liquid behaviour in metallic nanotubes with a numerical renormalization group that enables one to study the effects of gapping out a multi - component luttinger liquid . in the process </S>",
    "<S> we find in a regime of strong electron - electron interactions a number of new qualitative features to the excitonic spectra ( see fig . </S>",

    "<S> first and foremost we find that a given subband of the nanotube has a finite number of optically active one - photon excitons , @xmath0 , where the multiplicity depends on the strength of the tube s screened coulomb interaction . while a simple picture of excitons as analogs of the excited states of a hydrogen atom @xcite yields an infinite hierarchy of excitons , we argue this series is truncated to at most three . in order to understand the excitons binding energy , we also study the single particle spectrum of the tube </S>",
    "<S> . the single particle gap is strongly renormalized by interactions and can be many multiples of the bare bandgap . </S>",
    "<S> consequently the lowest lying two - excitation continuum , depending on strength of the coulomb interaction , may be a particle - hole continuum _ or _ it may be a two - exciton continuum . </S>",
    "<S> this approach treats all excitations of the nanotube on the same footing . </S>",
    "<S> it thus conflates the difference between an exciton and a bi - exciton . </S>",
    "<S> indeed interactions can be sufficiently strong that excitons should then be thought of equally as particle - hole bound states or bound states of two other excitons .    our results are applicable both to semiconducting nanotubes and metallic nanotubes which have been turned semiconducting by the application of an axial magnetic field @xcite . in the latter case where the gap is tunable and </S>",
    "<S> can be made much smaller than the bandwidth , we expect our approach to yield results that are quantitatively accurate . for tubes that are semiconducting due to band structure , our results within a one subband approximation are most reliable for large radius tubes although we believe the qualitative features that we find to apply equally well to smaller radius tubes .    </S>",
    "<S> we focus on a single subband of a carbon nanotube . to describe this subband at low energies </S>",
    "<S> we introduce four sets ( two for the spin , @xmath1 , degeneracy and two for the valley , @xmath2 , degeneracy ) of right ( @xmath3 ) and left ( @xmath4 ) moving fermions , @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian governing these fermions can be written as @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7 together give the non - interacting band dispersion , @xmath8 : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the bare velocity of the fermions and repeated indices are summed . for the coulombic part of the hamiltonian </S>",

    "<S> we also ignore backscattering interactions arising from coulomb interactions . in the presence of a gap term , </S>",
    "<S> these interactions , as they are marginal in the rg sense , are less important . but as they lift the model s su(4 ) symmetry , they will split the lowest lying 15-fold multiplet of optically dark excitons .    to study the full hamiltonian , we treat @xmath13 as a perturbing term ( albeit one to be treated non - perturbatively ) of @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter terms are nothing more than the hamiltonian of a metallic carbon nanotube . in excitonic language </S>",
    "<S> , we thus think of @xmath13 as a confining interaction on top of the metallic tube . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of doing so is that we are able to treat coulomb interactions _ analytically exactly _ at the beginning of the computation . </S>",
    "<S> we do so using bosonization .    </S>",

    "<S> the theory is equivalent to four luttinger liquids described by the four bosons @xmath18 , @xmath19 ( and their duals @xmath20 ) @xmath21 the four bosons diagonalizing @xmath15 are linear combinations of the original four bosons and represent an effective charge - flavour separation where @xmath22 is the charge boson and the remaining three bosons reflect the spin , valley , and parity symmetries in the problem . </S>",

    "<S> these renormalizations , however , will not change any of our results qualitatively .    under bosonization </S>",

    "<S> can be had by considering the classical limit and asking what are the classical field solutions that correspond to the excitons / bound states . </S>",
    "<S> this is true here as well . </S>",
    "<S> the first one - photon exciton , @xmath0 , corresponds to a breather - like solution of the field equations governing @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> this solution corresponds to @xmath63 interpolating between @xmath64 to @xmath65 and back to @xmath64 while the other three bosons remain fixed at @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> it takes the form @xmath66 where @xmath67 is related to the ( classical ) energy of the breather . </S>",
    "<S> we can estimate the energy corresponding to quantizing this classical solution via mean field theory . replacing @xmath13 by @xmath68 , where @xmath69 with @xmath70 , or @xmath71 , we reduce the model to a pure sine - gordon theory </S>",
    "<S> . @xmath60 is then equal to the gap of this theory s first bound state @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath75 is determined self - consistently by replacing @xmath13 with @xmath76 and using @xcite to express @xmath75 in terms of the effective coupling constant @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> we consequently find that as @xmath78 varies between @xmath79 and @xmath80 , @xmath81 varies from @xmath82 to @xmath83 in reasonable agreement ( if shifted upwards ) with the non - perturbative nrg .    </S>",
    "<S> the second one - photon exciton , @xmath84 , has a gap a little more than twice that of @xmath60 and corresponds to roughly the putative location of @xmath85 , the first exciton in the second subband ( which we have argued , by scaling , is found at @xmath86 ) . </S>",
    "<S> if we were to take into account intersubband coulomb interactions , hitherto ignored , @xmath84 and @xmath85 would mix leading to a set of hybridized states . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus conceivable that reports of observations of the exciton @xmath85 are in fact seeing @xmath84 or at least some hybridized combination of the two .    beyond the one - photon excitons , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 also displays the gaps of a number of other excitons . </S>",
    "<S> it shows the single existing two - photon exciton , @xmath61 ( here g corresponds to excitons which are symmetrical under @xmath87-rotations about a centre of a carbon hexagon ) . </S>",
    "<S> unlike the one - photon excitons , there is only a single stable two - photon exciton regardless of the value of @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> lying just below @xmath60 are found a set of 15 dark excitons with energy @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> these excitons subsume the dark triplet excitons but are of greater degeneracy because they not only carry spin quantum numbers but valley quantum numbers as well ( dark excitons with non - trivial valley quantum number were termed @xmath89-momentum excitons in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . as the full symmetry of @xmath90 </S>",
    "<S> is su(4 ) , the dark excitons transform as su(4 ) s adjoint . at twice </S>",
    "<S> the energy of @xmath88 begins a two exciton continuum into which any two - photon exciton will decay . as @xmath61 is just below @xmath91 </S>",
    "<S> , we understand this two exciton continuum essentially precludes any two - photon excitons with energy greater than @xmath61 .    by examining the momentum dependence of the excitons dispersions </S>",
    "<S> , we can see the consequences of having two velocities , charge , @xmath92 , and flavour @xmath93 , in the system . </S>",
    "<S> the above semiclassics suggests that the initial dispersion of @xmath60 , @xmath94 , will behave approximately as @xmath95 ( a consequence of it involving @xmath63 degrees of freedom alone ) . </S>",
    "<S> while we can not write down the classical solution corresponding to @xmath84 , it lies primarily in the spin / flavor sector and so will disperse governed by the much smaller velocity , @xmath10 . while @xmath96 , the much larger charge velocity means that the dispersion of @xmath60 will intersect @xmath84 at a relatively small momentum , @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> this intersection means the two states will hybridize . as a consequence of this hybridization , for momenta larger than @xmath98 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath99 will disperse with an effective mass determined by @xmath10 whereas @xmath100 will now vary according to a velocity much closer to the larger @xmath92 .    </S>",
    "<S> we observe this general behaviour in our numerical analysis . plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 are the dispersions of these two excitons for @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that @xmath94 increases extremely rapidly for momenta up to @xmath102 but thereafter levels out , even decreasing . </S>",
    "<S> this increase is greater than would be predicted from the relativistic dispersion , @xmath95 , suggesting that charge and spin , even at the smallest momenta , are intricately linked , leading to an even stronger renormalization of the effective mass . </S>",
    "<S> if however we combine the renormalization due to @xmath92 with the logarithmic correction @xmath103 , to the exciton self - energy predicted in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we can understand the observed behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> complementarily , @xmath104 initially displays a weak momentum dependence but then increases with a velocity approximately @xmath105 for @xmath106 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally we touch upon the excitonic signal in absorption spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of this signal is proportional to the imaginary part of the current - current correlator . </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to compute the necessary matrix elements of the current operator within the framework of tcsa+nrg . </S>",
    "<S> we find , as indicated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , that @xmath60 has by far the strongest signal . while @xmath84 should be visible in an absorption spectra , @xmath107 , with a weighting 1/1000 of @xmath60 </S>",
    "<S> is effectively dark although could be detected indirectly through its effects on the temperature dependence of the excitonic radiative lifetime @xcite .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have argued for , using a fully many - body , non - perturbative approach , new features in the excitonic spectrum of gapped carbon nanotubes . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that with a given subband , optically active excitons appear in _ finite _ hierarchies . </S>",
    "<S> we have also shown that the single particle sector experiences extremely strong renormalization so swapping the beginning of the particle - hole continuum with the two - exciton continuum . </S>",
    "<S> further work will include studying the effects of backscattering interactions in the tubes ( not treated here ) together with intersubband interactions . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , we have demonstrated a robust method able to treat continuum representations of arbitrary one - dimensional systems .    </S>",
