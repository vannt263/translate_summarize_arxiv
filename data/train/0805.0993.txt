    "recently holographic dual models of qcd were proposed @xcite and applied for investigations to the hadronic physics .",
    "this approach is based on the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , and is aiming to construct dual models of qcd in 5-dimensional anti - de sitter ( ads ) space . invented models incorporate important features of qcd , as confinement and chiral symmetry breaking , and allow one to calculate numerous hadronic properties including masses , decay constants , couplings of various mesons .",

    "is used to compute the pion spacelike electromagnetic form factor in the context of the qcd light - cone sum rule ( lcsr ) method with twist-6 accuracy by taking into account @xmath4 order correction to the leading twist term . the twist-4 da of the pion , necessary to determine the twist-4 contribution to the ff , is derived in the context of the renormalon method . the twist-4 contribution is also modeled employing the asymptotic form of the pion twist-4 da following from the conformal expansion .",

    "contrary , for the momentum transfers @xmath91 the hqcd twist-4 term overtakes other twist-4 contributions .",
    "what is important , in the whole region of considering momentum transfers only the hqcd twist-4 term is monotonically increasing function of @xmath90 .",

    "nevertheless such agreement can be achieved only for the large values of the parameter @xmath93 . from this analysis",
    "it is legitimate to conclude that the enhancement generated by the shape of the function @xmath0 in the relevant terms of eq.([eq:1 ] ) and the asymptotic twist-4 term is enough to explain the data on @xmath1 in the lcsr treatment .",

    "@xcite both the old experimental results @xcite and new ones from the jefferson lab .",
    "@xmath96 collaboration @xcite were used .",
    "it is worth noting that the pion form factor is not measured directly and real measurements of the process @xmath97 require an extrapolation of the off - shell pion to the mass - shell . because this extrapolation becomes increasingly problematic as @xmath90 increases and at high momentum transfers the old results suffer from large uncertainties , in the present work we remove them from consideration .",
    "we also correct the data from the @xmath96 collaboration reported in ref .",

    "strictly speaking , the lcsr method is applicable in the domain of momentum transfers @xmath99 .",

    "let us note that the dashed line has been obtained choosing the maximal allowed value of @xmath107 .",
    "the first lcsr result with the hqcd distribution amplitude and renormalon inspired twist-4 function in the range of the momentum transfers @xmath108 demonstrates the scaling in accordance with @xmath109 law with a weak sign of the logarithmic running of the qcd coupling .",
    "this feature can be explained as a consequence of the dependence of the corresponding twist-4 term on @xmath90 due to the enhancement of the @xmath110 at end - point regions .",
    "the second lcsr prediction computed also in this work differs from the first one only in the choice of the twist-4 term .",
    "it is evident that the dashed line shows more rapid fall - off with @xmath90 than the lower solid line , though due to the choice @xmath107 is in agreement with the data .",
    "such rapid falling is typical for other lcsr curves obtained using the pqcd das ( fig.[fig : fig5 ] ) .    in the lcsr method",
    "the soft component of the pion ff is modeled by the leading order twist-2 term and some piece of the @xmath111 order correction to the twist-2 term .",
    "the leading order higher twist terms are soft contributions to the pion ff as well .",
    "there are various approaches to model the soft component of the ff .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite the pion ff was evaluated applying the standard hard - scattering approach and the qcd running coupling method .",
    "it was demonstrated that the borel resummed expression of the form factor contains both the soft and hard components , and in the asymptotic limit @xmath112 the standard pqcd result can be recovered . alternatively , in ref .",
    "@xcite soft and hard contributions to the pion electromagnetic ff were calculated within the light - front quark model and comparison with the ads / cft prediction was performed .",
    "the authors reported on excellent agreement of their result with the hqcd prediction .",
    "comparison of our results with the soft - wall holographic qcd prediction reveals the discrepancy between them .",
    "first of all , the prediction of the holographic qcd overestimates the jlab data : a situation with a hard - wall result is even worse @xcite .",
    "second , the hqcd prediction obeys the scaling @xmath113 with @xmath114 . from our point of view , emphasized also in ref .",
    "@xcite , for a reliable analysis one should evolve the pion da to a scale of the considering process , which in our case is equal to a few @xmath115 .",
    "this procedure inevitably demands to include nonasymptotic terms into the holographic da of the pion .",
    "in other words , for credible phenomenological applications the holographic qcd version of eq.([eq:8 ] ) , where the function @xmath0 is only the first term in a relevant expansion , is required .",
    "higher order corrections neglected in present investigations of the ads / cft correspondence may improve a situation , too @xcite .    for successful applications of the pion hqcd distribution amplitude within the framework of traditional methods of the perturbative qcd , one should prove that this da describes also other exclusive and semi - inclusive processes involving the pion .",
    "the simplest such process is the pion electromagnetic transition form factor @xmath116 . in the context of the lcsr method it was computed in refs .",
    "@xcite : the result was derived with twist-4 accuracy including the next - to - leading order correction to the twist-2 term . in the context of the lcsr and renormalon methods",
    "this form factor was analyzed in refs.@xcite .",
    "preliminary calculations demonstrate that the twist-2 term in the lcsr expression for @xmath116 found using @xmath0 exceeds the measured experimental data @xcite . but",
    "contributions of the next - to - leading order and twist-4 terms to the lcsr are negative and reduce the magnitude of the leading twist contribution ( see , for example , @xcite ) : hence an agreement with the data may be achieved .",
    "a complete analysis of @xmath116 requires to compute using @xmath0 the renormalon - based twist-4 function @xmath117 @xcite that determines the twist-4 contribution to the transition ff .",
    "this problem requires separate investigations .",
    "in the present work we have calculated the pion spacelike electromagnetic form factor @xmath1 in the qcd lcsr framework . we have used the distribution amplitude of the pion derived in the holographic qcd , which has a broader shape than the pqcd asymptotic da .",
    "the twist-4 da has been obtained applying the renormalon inspired model of ref .",
    "the prediction of the lcsr method obtained with the twist-6 accuracy by means of the functions @xmath0 and @xmath81 lies below the data , and does not describe the experimental situation .",
    "the agreement with the data can be achieved provided the hqcd twist-4 term is replaced by the asymptotic one and @xmath93 is chosen .",
    "we have also computed @xmath1 utilizing the pion pqcd leading twist das with two nonasymptotic terms and corresponding renormalon inspired twist-4 das .",
    "it has been proved that in this case in the region @xmath118 the qcd lcsr method explains the new experimental situation emerged due to the data of the jlab experiment .",
    "comparison with results of the holographic qcd @xcite has revealed an interesting tendency : the holographic qcd predictions for @xmath92 obtained within the both hard- and soft - wall models are increasing functions of @xmath90 , whereas in the lcsr treatment at large momentum transfers one finds an opposite picture .",
    "it is worth noting that the scaling of the form factor calculated employing the functions @xmath0 and @xmath119 is very promising .",
    "unfortunately , the corresponding curve runs below the data . in order to enhance the magnitude of @xmath1 and reach an agreement with the data",
    "additional contributions are needed .",
    "it seems to us that such contributions may appear due to the holographic qcd counterparts of the nonasymptotic terms in the pion pqcd leading twist da ( [ eq:8 ] ) .",
    "if extracted , these terms may improve scaling properties and normalization of the holographic qcd predictions themselves .",
