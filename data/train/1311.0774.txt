    "one of the more interesting observations to emerge from the study of two - particle angular correlation data from heavy - ion collisions at the rhic and the lhc is the appearance of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) peak at small relative azimuth ( same - side @xmath0 ) which significantly increases in amplitude and in width along relative pseudorapidity for more - central collisions @xcite . for minimum - bias @xmath2 collisions and for au+au collisions from peripheral to mid - centrality ( 50% of fractional cross section ) at rhic",
    "this correlation peak structure is consistent with perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) predictions for minimum - bias jets ( those with no lower momentum cut ) assuming binary nucleon - nucleon collision scaling @xcite .",
    "the dynamical origin of the @xmath1 width increase of the same - side peak for more - central collisions is not known .",
    "alver and roland @xcite conjectured that the @xmath1-elongation is caused by triangular flow , a @xmath3 element or sextupole .",
    "critical evaluations  @xcite show that this sextupole is determined by the multipole decomposition of the azimuth projection of the same - side 2d peak , implying that the sextupole derives from that structure rather than from some other aspect of the data .",
    "another long - range @xmath1 correlation is the quadrupole , a @xmath4 element , proportional to @xmath5 and conventionally attributed to elliptic flow .",
    "however , the simultaneous occurrence of pqcd minijets and large quadrupole in peripheral to mid - central 200 gev au+au correlation data  @xcite calls into question the notion of a strongly interacting medium . analysis of the quadrupole correlation systematics with respect to collision energy , transverse momentum ( @xmath6 ) , and centrality shows that its amplitude scales with the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions , @xmath7 and eccentricity implying that the quadrupole is generated in the initial state rather than via final - state scattering .",
    "the properties of the same - side 2d peak and the quadrupole correlation lead to a general consideration of long - range pseudorapidity correlations from heavy - ion collisions and the possibility that these structures can be understood within a pqcd framework .",
    "for the correlations shown here sibling pairs ( those from the same event ) and mixed - event pair histograms for all charged particles in the star tpc acceptance ( @xmath8  gev/@xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 azimuth ) are filled on relative azimuth @xmath12 and pseudorapidity @xmath13 .",
    "there is no `` trigger '' particle ; all pairs are used . a per - particle normalization is used which eliminates the trivial combinatoric @xmath14 dependence of per - pair quantities such as @xmath5 .",
    "the measured quantity reported in  @xcite is [ eq1 ] & & , where @xmath15 is the single charged particle density .",
    "the principal correlation structures are well described with a same - side 2d gaussian , an away - side ( @xmath16 ) dipole , a quadrupole , and a same - side 2d exponential which describes conversion electrons and quantum correlations .",
    "the standard fitting model is defined in @xcite .",
    "no additional model elements are required to describe the minimum - bias @xmath6-integral 2d angular correlation data from star .",
    "an added sextupole term would have the form @xmath17 .",
    "the standard model function accurately describes the @xmath18-independent structure in the away - side correlation data  @xcite . including a sextupole forces the dipole and quadrupole terms to adjust to maintain a good fit .",
    "the net difference is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for model fits to more - central au+au correlation data .",
    "the right - most panel shows the quantity [ @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 where primes indicate fitting parameters obtained with an included sextupole . the net structural difference is a narrow , same - side 1d peak ( effective ridge ) on azimuth  @xcite which is accurately represented as a periodic 1d gaussian .",
    "fitting the data with an added sextupole element is statistically equivalent to fitting the data with an additional 1d same - side azimuth gaussian ( ssg ) whose width is approximately 0.7 .",
    "( -40,75)*(a ) *   ( -40,75)*(b ) *   ( -50,77)*(c ) *        the combination of an azimuth ridge and a 2d gaussian produces a ng 2d peak . projections of the same - side correlation data onto @xmath18 are consistent with a 1d gaussian within statistics .",
    "however , including small ng dependence improves the @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional ng fitting models  @xcite are therefore considered further .",
    "ng modifications to the standard fitting model included : ( i ) replacing both exponents in the ss 2d gaussian with fit parameters ; ( ii ) replacing the @xmath18-dependent gaussian with a power series through terms of order @xmath23 ; ( iii ) same as ( ii ) but allowing the exponent of the @xmath24-dependent gaussian to vary ; ( iv ) adding quartic @xmath23 and @xmath25 terms in the argument of the exponential .",
    "the functional forms are given in  @xcite .",
    "the sextupole term was excluded from fits which included these ng functions .",
    "these five ng fitting models plus the standard model function with and without the sextupole were used to fit the angular correlation data for 200 gev minimum - bias au+au collisions from star  @xcite .",
    "the best - fit values of @xmath22 per degree - of - freedom ( dof ) for all models and collision centralities are plotted in fig .",
    "centrality is represented by the fraction of total cross section @xmath26 , where results for peripheral collisions are shown on the left - hand side . from these results",
    "we find that all of the ng models reduce the @xmath22/dof for the mid- to more - central collision data from @xmath27 = 0.4 to 0.9 .",
    "the sextupole model is not special in that regard . for the ng models studied here the quartic model produces the best overall @xmath22/dof .",
    "correlation measurements with higher @xmath6 cuts and for the higher collision energies attained at the lhc  @xcite provide strong evidence for ng dependence in the same - side 2d peak .",
    "it should not be surprising if a small ng dependence exists for same - side @xmath6-integral correlations at rhic energies .",
    "such occurrence would not exclude the possibility that the same - side correlation peak is dominated by pqcd jets with modified fragmentation  @xcite .",
    "while none of the ng fitting models considered here are excluded , it seems more plausible for possible ng structure in these data to originate locally in relative azimuth rather than arising from the combination of a same - side peaked structure with global angle correlations , such as @xmath28 harmonics .",
    "the scaling properties of the quadrupole correlation suggest that it may originate in the initial state via pqcd processes .",
    "several authors recently presented pqcd based models in which a quadrupole correlation is generated by coherent gluon radiation from either bfkl pomeron ladders  @xcite , color dipoles  @xcite , or glasma  @xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite provides explicit calculations which facilitate comparisons to data .",
    "results from that paper are used here .    in ref .",

    "[ fig3 ] results in quantum interference among the outgoing gluons such that the singles distribution contains a term proportional to @xmath29 where @xmath0 is measured relative to the n - n pomeron momentum transfer @xmath30 .",
    "the two - gluon density is [ eq2 ] & = & n ( 1 + p^2_t1 p^2_t2 q^4_t q^-4 ^2 ( 2 + 2 _ ) ) , where @xmath31 is proportional to the product of the single gluon distributions times the probability @xmath32 of producing a two - pomeron parton shower in a hadron - hadron collision .",
    "the momentum integrals were estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite assuming a gluon saturation model with saturation scale @xmath33 , however , the unknown probability @xmath32 was not estimated .",
    "each parton shower is assumed to produce a poisson distribution with an average charged particle multiplicity @xmath34 equal to the minimum - bias average multiplicity  @xcite which is 2.5 per unit @xmath1 at midrapidity for @xmath2 at @xmath35 = 200  gev  @xcite .",

    "in addition there is a finite probability of producing a hard - scattering process  @xcite in each @xmath2 collision .",
    "these factors were combined in a model of the minimum - bias @xmath2 multiplicity frequency distribution , where the data are described with a negative binomial distribution ( nbd ) .",
    "fits to the latter provide estimates of @xmath36 .",
    "the hard - scattering component of multiplicity in minimum - bias @xmath2 collisions at 200 gev was studied in  @xcite . defining the soft and hard particle multiplicities as @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where the total charged particle multiplicity @xmath40 , it was found that [ eq3 ] n_h / n_s & = & n_ch where @xmath41 and [ eq3b ] n_h & = & n_s^2 / ( 1 - n_s ) . the frequency distribution on @xmath38 in this model is @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the poisson distribution on @xmath44 for mean @xmath45 .",
    "the hard component distribution depends on @xmath38 and is proportional to @xmath46 .",

    "the momentum integrals were estimated in ref .  @xcite as @xmath54 in the fully saturated limit and as @xmath55 in the semi - saturated domain where @xmath56 is assumed to be 0.6  ( gev/@xmath9)@xmath53 and the dipole cut - off mass @xmath57 was assumed to be between 0.8 and 1.6  gev@xmath53 .",
    "the quadrupole amplitude is predicted to be between 0.0003 and 0.003  @xcite depending on the assumed gluon saturation model .",
    "the measured 200 gev @xmath2 minimum - bias quadrupole reported by the star experiment at this conference  @xcite is 0.002 corresponding to azimuth asymmetry parameter @xmath58 , a large value compared to typical @xmath6-integral @xmath59 values for au+au collisions .",

    "the bfkl predicted quadrupole amplitude should increase with event multiplicity owing to the increasing 2-pomeron probability shown in fig .",

    "application of this model to proton + nucleus and nucleus + nucleus collisions can be done assuming a glauber superposition approach .",

    "if individual 2-pomeron momentum transfer vectors @xmath30 are aligned via the initial overlap geometry of the colliding ions , then the total p+a and a+a quadrupole amplitudes will be further enhanced .",
    "the physics implications of two - particle angular correlations from the rhic and the lhc heavy - ion programs are intriguing .",
    "most of the current interest concerns two major structures @xmath20 a jet related peak with its accompanying away - side dijet ridge , and a quadrupole .",

    "the simultaneous appearance of approximately unperturbed minijets and large quadrupole correlations combined with the latter s initial - state scaling properties suggest that an underlying pqcd mechanism may be responsible for the quadrupole correlation .",
