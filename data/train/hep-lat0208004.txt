    "during the past few years the symanzik effective field theory has been an important focus of research in lattice gauge theory .",
    "symanzik s idea is to describe cutoff effects in lattice field theory by a continuum effective field theory  @xcite .",
    "one writes  @xcite @xmath2 where the symbol @xmath3 means that the lattice and symanzik field theories have the same on - shell matrix elements . for lattice qcd with wilson fermions  @xcite the symanzik local effective lagrangian ( le@xmath4 ) is given by  @xcite @xmath5 -          \\bar{q}\\left({\\kern+0.1em /\\kern-0.65em d } + m\\right)q           + ak_{\\sigma\\cdot f}\\ ,           \\bar{q}i\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}f^{\\mu\\nu}q + o(a^2 ) ,       \\label{eq : lel}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is a renormalized coupling , @xmath7 is a renormalized quark mass , and @xmath8 is a short - distance coefficient . the effective field theory is useful when the scale of qcd in lattice units is small , @xmath9 , and , as used in this paper , when @xmath10  also . with the description in hand ,",
    "the lattice field theory can be adjusted so that it approaches its continuum limit more quickly .",
    "the effective theory shows that if @xmath11 is reduced for any given on - shell matrix element , then the @xmath0 term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lel ] ) makes commensurately smaller contributions to all other on - shell matrix elements .",
    "this application of the symanzik effective field theory is called the symanzik improvement program  @xcite .",
    "a similar correspondence is set up for the vector and axial vector currents ( see below ) , introducing further short - distance coefficients . in the last several years methods",
    "have been devised to study all of them non - perturbatively @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 discretization effects violate chiral symmetry , so the key idea is to ensure that violations of chiral symmetry are at least  @xmath12 . on the other hand , because of asymptotic freedom and the success of perturbative qcd , even at gev energies  @xcite , one expects perturbation theory to yield accurate estimates of the short - distance coefficients . in this paper",
    ", we compare a perturbative calculation of the currents short - distant coefficients to the non - perturbative results .",
    "there are two issues that should be kept in mind when making such a comparison .",
    "first , the non - perturbative technique suffers from power corrections .",
    "asymptotically , as @xmath13 these are formally smaller than any error made from truncating the perturbation series . in practice",
    ", however , these effects can be significant .",
    "second , no two - loop results are available for the improvement coefficients considered here .",
    "tests of perturbation theory are , therefore , not unambiguous , because different choices for the expansion parameter  @xmath6 yield quantitatively different results .",
    "the bare coupling  @xmath14 ( for the wilson gauge action ) is an especially bad expansion parameter  @xcite .",
    "the obvious remedy is to rearrange the perturbative series , eliminating @xmath14 in favor of a renormalized ( running ) coupling , evaluated at a scale characteristic of the problem at hand .",
    "one is then faced , however , with many choices of renormalization scheme , and the question of how to determine the `` characteristic scale . '' in this paper we choose the brodsky - lepage - mackenzie ( blm ) prescription  @xcite .",
    "once this choice is made , little subjectivity remains , so one can ask quantitatively whether one - loop blm perturbation theory agrees with the non - perturbative method .    in the blm method ,",
    "the characteristic scale is computed from feynman diagrams . the new information presented in this paper",
    "consists of the calculations needed to determine the blm scales of the normalization and improvement coefficients of the vector and axial vector currents for wilson fermions with sheikholeslami - wohlert action .",
    "these calculations are a by - product of our recent work on the normalization and improvement of lattice currents with heavy quarks  @xcite .",
    "details of the calculational method may be found there .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : currents ] we define the lattice currents and review their description in the symanzik effective field theory . section  [ sec : blm ] recalls the blm prescription , focusing on points that are sometimes overlooked .",

    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "this paves the way for a systematic comparison with non - perturbative calculations of the same quantities in sec .",

    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] contains a few concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we review the description of lattice currents with the symanzik effective field theory . for quarks",
    "we take the sheikholeslami - wohlert lagrangian  @xcite , which has an improvement coupling  @xmath15 . at the tree level @xmath16}=\\frac{1}{4}(1-c_{\\text{sw}})$ ] , so the improvement condition @xmath17 requires @xmath18 . for one - loop calculations ,",
    "it is sufficient to specify @xmath15 at the tree level . for the non - perturbative calculations cited below",

    "the `` small '' improvement terms become large , introducing unnecessary violations of heavy - quark symmetry .",
    "better currents for heavy quarks are given in refs .",
    "@xcite . ] in symanzik s theory of cutoff effects , the lattice currents are described by operators in a continuum effective field theory  @xcite @xmath24 where , as in eq .",

    "further dimension - four operators are omitted from eqs .",

    "the short - distance coefficients in the effective lagrangian@xmath27 and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 , @xmath30)are functions of @xmath6 and @xmath31 , and the improvement couplings @xmath15 and @xmath32 .",
    "symanzik improvement is achieved by adjusting @xmath32 so that @xmath33",

    "in this section we review the blm prescription , following the argumentation from ref .",
    "this material should be familiar , but some of the literature on non - perturbative improvement blurs the difference between blm perturbation theory and other topics , such as `` tadpole improvement '' and mean - field estimates of the renormalized coupling , which are also discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the problem is to find a reasonably accurate one - loop estimate of a quantity  @xmath44 , here @xmath27 or @xmath28 . in these cases ,",
    "one gluon with momentum  @xmath45 and propagator  @xmath46 appears .",

    "the ellipsis indicates higher - order terms that we would like to absorb into the renormalized coupling  @xmath49 .",
    "an important class of higher - order terms consists of the renormalization parts that dress the exchanged gluon . in the fourier",
    "transform of the heavy - quark potential , for example , they turn @xmath50 into @xmath51 , where the potential @xmath52 .",
    "thus , @xmath47}(p ) =          \\int \\frac{d^4k}{(2\\pi)^4 } g_v^2(k ) d(k ) f(k , p ) + \\cdots      \\label{eq : one - loop - renormed}\\ ] ] sums the renormalization parts .",
    "other ways of dressing the gluon would lead to other physical running couplings , but they all are the same at order  @xmath53 @xcite , where @xmath54 is the one - loop coefficient of the @xmath55  function for @xmath56 light quarks .    if there is a characteristic scale @xmath1 , one can approximate @xmath57 the aim is to choose @xmath1 so that higher - order terms are small , particularly those of order @xmath58 , which could be enhanced by a foolish choice of @xmath1 . inserting eq .",

    "blm perturbation theory for the current normalization factors  @xmath104 agrees very well with non - perturbative calculations of the same quantities . here",
    "the leading power correction is only of order @xmath105 , and the small deviations can probably be removed with a two - loop calculation . note that generalizations of the blm method for higher - order perturbation theory have been considered in continuum perturbative qcd  @xcite and in lattice gauge theory  @xcite .    for the improvement coefficients @xmath106 and @xmath32 ,",
    "the leading power corrections are of order @xmath107 ( and in the schrdinger functional also of order @xmath108 ) , while some of the one - loop coefficients are small .",
    "it is consequently difficult to diagnose the discrepancies . by noting the size and dependence on @xmath14 of the differences , we concur with the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite , namely , that power corrections contaminate the non - perturbative results .",
