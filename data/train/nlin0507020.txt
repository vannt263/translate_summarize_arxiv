    "in the last decade , ideas and methods of dynamical systems theory have been used actively in physical oceanography with the aim to describe qualitatively and quantitatively impact of coherent structures in the ocean on transport and mixing of passive particles ( water masses , temperature , salinity , pollutants , etc . )",

    "one means particles which take on the velocity of a flow very rapidly and do not influence the flow . by a coherent structure ,",
    "we mean a quasistationary structure that can be recognized during a time much longer than all eulerian time characteristics of a flow .",
    "example of _ an eulerian coherent structure _ is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] as a satellite image of the gulf stream with a loop of warmer water . in the lagrangian approach ,",
    "we are interested not in the velocity field but in movement of fluid parcels or passive scalars which satisfy the vector equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the vector position of a particle and its vector velocity at the point @xmath4 , respectively . the eulerian velocity field @xmath5 is given as a solution of a hydrodynamic equation or it is measured in the ocean ( on the sea surface it can be done , for example , with the help of a doppler radar ) .",
    "[ 1 ] is a three dimensional dynamical system whose phase space is the physical space for advected particles .",
    "it is well known in dynamical system s theory that invariant manifolds , like stationary points , different kinds of attractors , including strange ones , kam tori , cantori , stable and unstable manifolds , define mainly transport and mixing in the phase space . in hydrodynamics",
    "it is natural to call them _ lagrangian coherent structures _ that define global transport and mixing of passive particles in fluids .",
    "lagrangian structures can be visualized in laboratory in dye experiments and partially in the ocean with the help of drifters and buoys @xcite .",
    "the main task of dynamical system s theory in physical oceanography is to find and specify lagrangian coherent structures and their impact on transport and mixing of water masses .",
    "methods of that theory are attractive especially because they are common for different classes of models , dynamic and kinematic ones , and do not depend on their specific analytic forms because they use , mainly , fundamental geometric structures .    in this paper in the framework of the geometrical approach , we describe transport and mixing of passive particles in geophysical flows composed with the main eulerian coherent structures in the ocean , a jet - like current and an eddy .",
    "the focus of this work is not on dynamics of the flow but rather on mechanisms of particle s transport and mixing .",
    "that is why we use , as a prototype model , a kinematic model that was introduced in @xcite to describe the phenomenon of topographical eddies in the ocean @xcite .",
    "a current over seamounts and bottom cavities produce on the rotating earth ( quasi)stationary anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies , respectively .",
    "such eddies may arise over underwater ridges and valleys as well .    in modeling oceanic flows we should take into account , generally speaking , a periodic tidal component of the current under consideration and a random component caused by turbulent diffusion .",
    "a simple stream function that is able to describe the main features of the two - dimensional flow of ideal fluid over a @xmath6-like bottom topography has the following normalized form : @xmath7 } , \\label{2}\\ ] ] where the first term represents a fixed point vortex placed at the point with cartesian coordinates @xmath8 , the second and third ones describe a steady and periodic components of the current with the normalized velocities @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , and @xmath11 is a random function with @xmath12 being a normalized strength of noise .",
    "it immediately follows from incompressibility and two - dimensionality of the flow that equations of advection of passive particles are hamiltonian ones @xmath13 where dot denotes differention with respect to the normalized time @xmath14 .",
    "analysis of transport and mixing of advected particles in the flow given by the stream function ( [ 2 ] ) _ without random force _ has been done in our papers @xcite . in this section",
    "we discuss briefly the main results in the case of a periodic perturbation .        in the absence of any time dependence in the streamfunction ( [ 2 ] ) , the phase portrait of the unperturbed system consists of finite and infinite orbits separated by a separatrix encompassing the vortex and passing through the saddle point ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) . in the polar coordinates ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) , the unperturbed equations are solved in quadratures @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an integral of motion .",
    "depending on initial conditions , particles move either around the vortex along closed streamlines encompassed by the separatrix loop or around the loop along infinite streamlines .",
    "we have shown analytically and numerically in @xcite that under a small perturbation there exist transversal intersections of stable and unstable saddle - point manifolds in the neighborhood of the unperturbed separatrix . under periodic perturbation ,",
    "the particle s trajectories deviate from the steady - flow streamlines .",
    "we define there zones in the phase ( physical ) space as follows : free - stream region ( with incoming and outcoming components ) , mixing region and vortex core as the sets of trajectories with the number of times they wind around the vortex being zero , finite and infinite , respectively .",
    "transport is trivial in the free - stream region .",
    "the size of the vortex core depends on the ratio @xmath21 .",
    "the vortex core consists of regular periodic and quasiperiodic trajectories with thin stochastic layers between them .",
    "as the value @xmath21 increases , the vortex core grows while the mixing zone shrinks , correspondingly .",
    "the frequency of particle s rotation in the vortex core depends on the distance from the singular point @xmath22 and is much higher than the perturbation frequency that is equal to @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the perturbation can be treated as adiabatic with respect to most orbits inside the core , and these orbits are regular , except for those lying in a neighborhood of higher - order overlapping resonances which make up very narrow stochastic layers . in applications , it is important that kam tori in the vortex core make up impermeable barriers that limit particle s transport and mixing .",
    "the topology of trajectories in the mixing zone is much more complicated . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the poincar sections of the whole mixing region ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a with cartesian coordinates @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) and of a part of this region in the neighborhood of the half - integer primary resonance ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]b with the action @xmath26 and angle @xmath27 variables ) which is surrounded by higher order resonances",
    ". high density of points around the vortex core and the islands means the presence of cantori there which can trap particles for a long time .",
    "the cantori should play an important role in transport and mixing of passive particles in geophysical flows .",

    "the set consists of an infinite number of periodic and aperiodic ( chaotic ) orbits .",
    "all orbits in this set are unstable .",
    "if a tracer belongs to @xmath0 at the initial moment , then it remains in the mixing region as @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "the poincar section of @xmath0 is a set of points of lebesgue measure zero .",
    "most trajectories of the tracers advected in the mixing region of the incoming flow sooner or later leave the mixing region with the outgoing flow .",
    "however , their behavior is largely determined by the presence of @xmath0 .",
    "they can `` trail '' after trajectories of the saddle set wandering in their neighborhoods .",
    "each orbit in the chaotic set and , therefore , the entire set @xmath0 have both stable and unstable manifolds .",
    "the stable manifold @xmath31 of the chaotic set is defined as the invariant set of orbits approaching those in @xmath0 as @xmath29 .",
    "the unstable manifold @xmath32 is defined as the stable manifold corresponding to time - reserved dynamics .",
    "following trajectories in @xmath31 , tracers , advected by the incoming flow , enter the mixing region and remain there forever .",
    "it was mentioned above that the corresponding initial conditions make up a set of measure zero .",
    "the tracer trajectories that are initially close to those in the chaotic set follow the chaotic - set trajectories for a long time and eventually deviate from them , and leave the mixing region along the unstable manifold .",
    "this behavior offers a unique opportunity to extract important properties of @xmath0 by measuring the characteristics of scattered particles and to observe unstable manifolds directly in laboratory experiments and even in geophysical flows .",
    "an unstable manifold can be visualized by various methods .",
    "a blob consisting of many tracer particles , initially belonging to the intersection of the incoming flow with the stable manifold , spreads out and transforms into an intricate fractal curve approaching @xmath32 in the course of time .",
    "a similar pattern develops in dyeing experiments . the stable manifold lies in the coordinate - plane region bounded by the separatrix locations at the times corresponding to the two extrema reached during the perturbation period .",
    "this region extends to @xmath33 along the @xmath25 axis , and its width is determined by the values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 . only particles located in this region",
    "reach the mixing region .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows an image of the unstable manifold at @xmath28 obtained numerically by integrating the equations of motions for particles continuously injected into the incoming flow at the point with @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this pattern oscillates with the period of the flow .",
    "tracer particles are advected along the fractal curve of the unstable manifold , which plays the role of an `` attractor '' in a hamiltonian system @xcite ( there are no `` classical '' attractors in an incompressible flow ) .     and ( b ) the respective exit time @xmath36 vs initial particle s position @xmath37.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    choosing a material line in the incoming flow , we calculate the total number @xmath38 of turns executed by particles , belonging to this line , before they escape into the outgoing - flow region .",
    "the graph of @xmath39 is shown to be an intricate self - similar hierarchy of sequences of fragments of the material line ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]a ) .",
    "their fractal properties are generated by the infinite sequence of intersections of stable and unstable manifolds with the material line segment as it rotates about the vortex .",
    "following to the paper @xcite , we refereed to the sequences of segments corresponding to each @xmath40 as epistrophes .",
    "the epistrophes make up a hierarchy .",
    "numerical experiments on epistrophes lying on different levels reveal the following trends : ( i ) each epistrophe converges to a limit point in the material line segment under consideration ; ( ii ) the end points of each segment in an @xmath38th - level epistrophe are the limit points of an @xmath41th - level epistrophe ; ( iii ) the lengths of segments in an epistrophe decrease in geometric progression ; ( iv ) the common ratio @xmath42 of all progressions is related to the largest lyapunov exponent for the saddle point as follows : @xmath43 .",
    "the epistrophic structure manifests itself in the plot of dependence of the time of exit of particles from the mixing zone @xmath36 on their initial positions in the material line @xmath37 .",
    "this plot , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]b , demonstrates wild oscillations of the exit time @xmath36 in the neighborhood of singular points of the cantor - like set which , in principle , can be measured in real laboratory experiments .",
    "transport of passive particles is defined by a generic mechanism of scattering and folding in the flow , where stretching is caused by the stationary current component and folding   by the nonstationary tidal component and vortex .",
    "strictly speaking , the structure of the fractal chaotic scattering is defined by the chaotic invariant set @xmath0 with a stable @xmath31 and an unstable @xmath32 manifolds . in the physical space @xmath31 acts as a variety of dynamical traps that are able to trap the particles for a while",
    "we have identified a mechanism of trapping of the ends of strophes and epistrophes segments with the saddle unstable periodic orbit .",
    "stable manifolds of the other unstable periodic and chaotic orbits `` attract '' advected particles and deposit in the structure of the fractal as well . effect of different dynamical traps manifests itself on different timescales and for different values of the winding number @xmath38 . for @xmath14 of the order of a few perturbation periods and small @xmath38 , the mechanism of stretching and folding defines the particle s transport . with increasing @xmath14 and @xmath38 , the saddle orbit and other unstable periodic and chaotic orbits , belonging to the chaotic invariant set @xmath0 ,",
    "begin to play a significant role in forming the fractal .      in this section",
    "we discuss the results of a laboratory experiment on chaotic advection which has been carried out at the woods hole oceanographic institution @xcite with the aim to find a possible mechanism for fluid transport and mixing among a western boundary current and subbasin recirculation gyres .",
    "possible applications include the north atlantic deep western boundary current and its adjacent mesoscale recirculation gyres .",
    "transport and mixing of a dye in this real experiment are shown to be very similar to those in our model flow described in the preceding section .",
    "the respective flow has been set up in cylindrical laboratory tank ( 42.5 cm in diameter and a mean depth of 20 cm ) with a slopping bottom ( a slope is @xmath44 ) .",
    "the tank rotates at a fixed rate @xmath45 rad@xmath46s@xmath47 and the circulation is driven by a lid that rotates at a differential rate @xmath48 , producing a uniform , anticyclonic surface stress vortex . under a steady lid forcing , the ( nearly ) steady flow , consisting of the western boundary current with the velocity of @xmath49 cm@xmath46s@xmath47 and the twin gyre , can be set up .",
    "the main control parameter in the experiment is the ratio between the stommel and inertial boundary layers @xmath51 .",
    "the flow is almost steady if @xmath52 .",
    "varying the lid rotation @xmath53 it is possible to produce a time - periodic flow .",
    "different methods have been used for visualizing and measuring the horizontal circulation .",
    "neutrally buoyant plastic particles are suspended in the tank and illuminated by a laser light .",
    "streak images showing the trajectories of the particles over short time intervals are made from digital video recording of the flow .",
    "direct velocity measurements are made using particle image velocimetry with a spatial resolution of 1 cm .",
    "another visualization technique involves the injection of dye into the flow using a needle .",
    "dye patterns are illuminated from below and recorded from above using a video camera .    within the range @xmath54 , the recirculation splits into twin gyres , the northern and southern ones , forming the @xmath55-like figure .",
    "mixing of the dye is weak in the steady regime and thought to be due to double diffusion between the salty ambient water and the food color dye .",
    "the time dependence introduces considerably more complicated mixing of the dye . the sequence in fig .  [ fig5 ]",
    "@xcite shows the evolution of the dye contour over two periods of the lid oscillation with @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 s. dye is injected very close to the southern loop of unperturbed @xmath55-like separatrix ( south is to the right and west is downward in the figure ) .",
    "[ fig5]a corresponds to the time moment about three cycles after injection is begun ( @xmath59 ) , and fig .",
    "[ fig5]j is for @xmath60 .",
    "in fact , the above pictures illustrate the evolution of the unstable manifold of the respective chaotic invariant set .        transport and mixing",
    "depend strongly on which place in the flow the dye is injected .",
    "[ fig6 ] @xcite demonstrates the tracer streaklines with three different places of injection : just outside the southern gyre ( fig .",
    "[ fig6]a ) , just inside the western edge of the southern gyre ( fig .",
    "[ fig6]b ) and inside the very center of the southern gyre ( fig .",
    "[ fig6]c ) .",
    "in the first two cases , the prominent filaments of the dye are seen both in the southern and northern gyres .",
    "that is because the dye is injected very close to the unperturbed separatrix in both the case . in the third case",
    ", the dye is injected inside the gyre core and remains confined there by kam - tori which are impenetrable barriers for mixing ( except for molecular diffusion ) .",
    "we would like to pay attention on a similarity between the streaklines in our numerical experiment ( fig .",

    ", the dye is injected nearly the unperturbed separatrix , and both the pictures are images of the unstable manifolds of the respective chaotic invariant set @xmath0 .",
    "a difference is that the unperturbed separatrix in our model flow is of a @xmath61-like form , and , therefore , our flow has only one gyre .",
    "the detailed analysis , of transport and mixing , similar to one that has been done in our papers @xcite and in this paper , can be done for the laboratory flow @xcite modeling transport and mixing of water masses among western boundary currents and subbasin recirculation gyres .",

    "<S> methods of dynamical system s theory are used for numerical study of transport and mixing of passive particles ( water masses , temperature , salinity , pollutants , etc . ) in simple kinematic ocean models composed with the main eulerian coherent structures in a randomly fluctuating ocean   a jet - like current and an eddy . </S>",
    "<S> advection of passive tracers in a periodically - driven flow consisting of a background stream and an eddy ( the model inspired by the phenomenon of topographic eddies over mountains in the ocean and atmosphere ) is analyzed as an example of chaotic particle s scattering and transport . </S>",
    "<S> a numerical analysis reveals a nonattracting chaotic invariant set @xmath0 that determines scattering and trapping of particles from the incoming flow . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that both the trapping time for particles in the mixing region and the number of times their trajectories wind around the vortex have hierarchical fractal structure as functions of the initial particle s coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> scattering functions are singular on a cantor set of initial conditions , and this property should manifest itself by strong fluctuations of quantities measured in experiments . the lagrangian structures in our numerical experiments are shown to be similar to those found in a recent laboratory dye experiment at woods hole . </S>",
    "<S> transport and mixing of passive particles is studied in the kinematic model inspired by the interaction of a jet current ( like the gulf stream or the kuroshio ) with an eddy in a noisy environment . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate a non - trivial phenomenon of noise - induced clustering of passive particles and propose a method to find such clusters in numerical experiments . </S>",
    "<S> these clusters are patches of advected particles which can move together in a random velocity field for comparatively long time . </S>",
    "<S> the clusters appear due to existence of regions of stability in the phase space which is the physical space in the advection problem . </S>"
