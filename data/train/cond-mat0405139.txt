    "spin glasses ( sgs ) are random magnets where ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic exchange interactions co - exist and compete.@xcite experimentally , it is now well established that sg magnets in zero field exhibit a thermodynamic second - order phase transition at a nonzero temperature into the thermodynamic sg phase .",
    "by contrast , whether sg magnets exhibit a thermodynamic phase transition in applied magnetic fields has been a long - standing , yet unsolved issue .",
    "this issue is closely related to the fundamental question of whether the sg ordered state in zero field accompanies an ergodicity breaking not directly related to the global symmetry of the hamiltonian , _",
    "i.e. _ , the replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) .",
    "the experimental evidence of an in - field transition of sg remains to be obscure .",
    "for the strongly anisotropic ising - like sg , fe@xmath0mn@xmath0tio@xmath1 , the non - existence of an in - field sg transition was reported in ref.@xcite . meanwhile , many of real sg materials are more or less heisenberg - like rather than ising - like in the sense that the magnetic anisotropy is considerably weaker than the isotropic exchange interaction.@xcite recent experiments on such weakly anisotropic heisenberg - like sgs suggested the occurrence of an in - field sg transition,@xcite in apparent contrast to ref.@xcite . setting aside the question of the strict nature of the apparent sg `` transition '' observed experimentally in applied fields , it has been known that the `` transition line '' between the paramagnetic and the sg phases is similar to the one obtained for the mean - field sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model : @xcite namely , in the weak field regime , the in - field transition temperature , @xmath2 , is rapidly suppressed with increasing the field intensity @xmath3 , as @xmath4 ( de almeida - thouless ( at ) line @xcite ) , while in the high field regime , @xmath2 stays rather robust against @xmath3 , behaving as @xmath5 ( gabay - toulouse ( gt ) line @xcite ) .",
    "however , the reason why the mean - field results have given such a good description of the phase boundary , including the values of the critical exponents describing the phase boundary , has remained to be a mystery .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "most of numerical studies on the finite - ranged sg models in three dimensions ( 3d ) have focused on the properties of the ising sg.@xcite since no global symmetry exists in the ising sg under magnetic fields , an in - field transition , if any , should be a pure rsb transition .",
    "unfortunately , numerical simulations on the ising sg have been unable to give a definitive answer concerning the existence of a thermodynamic sg transition in magnetic fields.@xcite    for the isotropic 3d heisenberg sg in zero field , it has been believed for years that the sg transition occurs only at zero temperature , @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite since applied magnetic fields make the sg transition even more unlikely , one has expected no phase transition to occur in applied fields , and hence , until quite recently , no extensive numerical simulation has ever been performed for the 3d heisenberg sg in magnetic fields . meanwhile",
    ", recent studies have revealed that the heisenberg sg possesses an important physical ingredient absent in the ising sg , _",
    "i.e. _ , the _ chirality_.@xcite in the chirality scenario of ref.@xcite , in particular , the chirality is claimed to be a hidden order parameter of the sg transition of real heisenberg - like sg magnets : in the fully isotropic heisenberg sg , the spin and the chirality , though they are coupled at short length scales , are eventually decoupled at long length scales , and the system exhibits a chiral - glass transition at a finite temperature without accompanying the standard sg order .",
    "the chiral - glass transition corresponds to the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath8 spin - reflection symmetry with preserving the @xmath9 spin - proper - rotation symmetry . in the more realistic weakly anisotropic system ,",
    "the heisenberg spin , decoupled from the chirality in the isotropic system , is `` recoupled '' to the chirality at long length scales via the random magnetic anisotropy .",
    "the sg order of the weakly anisotropic heisenberg sg is then dictated at long length scales by the chirality ordering of the isotropic system .",
    "some numerical support of such a spin - chirality decoupling - recoupling scenario was already reported in zero field.@xcite    by contrast , some other groups claimed that the chiral - glass transition of the 3d isotropic heisenberg sg already accompanied the standard sg order , which means that the standard sg order occurs at a finite temperature simultaneously with the chirality.@xcite note that this is in contrast to the earlier belief in the community that the sg transition occurs only at @xmath10 in the 3d heisenberg sg .",
    "ref.@xcite maintains , however , that the sg order occurs at a temperature lower than the chiral - glass transition temperature , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath11 , and the controversy remains .",
    "recently , the present authors performed the first extensive mc simulation of the 3d heisenberg sg in magnetic fields , and have observed that the chiral - glass transition , essentially of the same character as in the zero - field one , occurs at a finite temperature even in magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite the chiral - glass transition line in the temperature - magnetic field phase diagram turned out to have a striking resemblance to the gt - line observed experimentally , although the nature of the transition is entirely different from the mean - field gt - line .",
    "note that the fully isotropic heisenberg sg in fields possesses the global @xmath12 symmetry , the chiral @xmath8 referring to the global spin - reflection with respect to the plane containing the magnetic - field axis , and the @xmath13 referring to the global spin - rotation around the magnetic - field axis .    in the more realistic case of the weakly anisotropic heisenberg sg , by contrast , there no longer remains any global symmetry in fields .",
    "hence , from symmetry , the situation is the same as that of the well - studied ising sg .",
    "meanwhile , in view of the fact that the heisenberg sg possesses the nontrivial chiral degree of freedom which is totally absent in the ising sg , the question of whether the ordering properties of the weakly anisotropic heisenberg sg in fields are essentially the same as those of the ising sg in fields seems not so trivial .",
    "this question is further promoted by the apparently contradicting experimental observations on the ising - like and weakly anisotropic heisenberg - like sgs.@xcite    in the present paper , we study both the spin - glass and the chiral - glass orderings of the weakly anisotropic heisenberg sg in magnetic fields by extensive equilibrium monte carlo ( mc ) simulations@xcite .",
    "we find a clear numerical evidence that a finite - temperature rsb transition occurs in the chiral sector , which also accompanies the simultaneous sg order .",
    "thus , in spite of the similarity in the symmetry properties , the ordering properties of the weakly anisotropic heisenberg sg model turn out to be quite different from those of the standard ising sg .",
    "this highlights the importance of the chirality .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we introduce our model and explain the details of the mc simulation .",
    "various physical quantities calculated in the simulation are defined in  3 , and the results of our numerical simulation are presented in  4 . in  5 , we perform the scaling analysis of the critical properties of the transition , and construct a phase diagram of the model in the temperature - magnetic field plane .",
    "section 6 is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "in this section , we introduce our model and explain some of the details of our numerical method .",
    "the model we consider is the isotropic classical heisenberg model on a 3d simple cubic lattice defined by the hamiltonian , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a three - component unit vector , and @xmath3 is the intensity of magnetic field applied along the @xmath16 direction .",
    "the isotropic nearest - neighbor exchange coupling @xmath17 is assumed to take either the value @xmath18 or @xmath19 with equal probability , while the nearest - neighbor random exchange anisotropy @xmath20 s ( @xmath21=@xmath22 are spin - component indices ) are assumed to be uniformly distributed in the range @xmath23 $ ] , where @xmath24 is the typical intensity of the anisotropy .",
    "we impose the relation @xmath25 .",
    "we perform equilibrium mc simulations on this model . in the present simulation ,",
    "we fix @xmath26 , which is a typical value of @xmath24 of real heisenberg - like sg materials .",
    "simulations are then performed for a variety of field intensities in the range @xmath27 .",
    "the lattices studied are simple - cubic lattices with @xmath28 sites with @xmath29 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 and 16 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "sample average is taken over 64 - 800 independent bond realizations , depending on the system size @xmath30 and the field intensity @xmath3 .",
    "limited amount of data are also taken for @xmath31 in some cases ( 32 samples ) to check the size dependence of physical quantities .    to facilitate efficient thermalization",
    ", we combine the standard heat - bath method with the temperature - exchange technique.@xcite the temperature - exchange trial is performed every heat - bath sweep .",
    "typically , for the size @xmath32 ( @xmath31 ) , we discard initial @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) heat - bath sweeps and the temperature - exchange trials for equilibration , and use subsequent @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) heat - bath sweeps and the temperature - exchange trials in calculating various physical quantities .",
    "care is taken to be sure that the system is fully equilibrated .",
    "equilibration is checked by the following procedures : first , we monitor the system to travel back and forth many times during the the temperature - exchange process ( typically more than 10 times ) between the maximum and minimum temperature points , and at the same time check that the relaxation due to the standard heat - bath updating is reasonably fast at the highest temperature , whose relaxation time is of order @xmath35 monte carlo steps per spin ( mcs ) .",
    "this guarantees that different parts of the phase space are sampled in each `` cycle '' of the temperature - exchange run .",
    "second , we check the stability of the results against at least three times longer runs for a subset of samples .",
    "error bars of physical quantities are estimated by the sample - to - sample statistical fluctuation over the bond realizations .",
    "further details of our mc simulations are given in table [ table - condition ] .",
    ".details of our mc simulations .",
    "@xmath36 represents the magnetic - field intensity , @xmath30 the lattice size , @xmath37 the total number of samples , @xmath38 the total number of temperature points used in the temperature - exchange run , @xmath39 and @xmath40 the maximum and minimum temperatures in the temperature - exchange run .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      finally , we show in fig.[fig_ht_phase ] a phase diagram of the present model with @xmath26 in the temperature - magnetic field plane .",
    "the obtained phase diagram has two noticeable features .",
    "first , for weaker fields @xmath42 , the transition line @xmath2 exhibits an at - like like behavior , _",
    "i.e. _ , the spin - glass ( chiral - glass ) transition temperature is suppressed rapidly under weak applied fields . in sharp contrast to this , for stronger fields of @xmath43 , the spin - glass ( chiral - glass ) transition temperature turns out to be rather insensitive to the field intensity , indicating that the spin - glass ( chiral - glass ) ordered state is robust against applied fields .",
    "the estimated @xmath2 value stays almost unchanged between the field values @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the latter value is already more than twice the zero - field transition temperature .",
    "indeed , the @xmath2 value in this field range is very close to the zero - field chiral - glass transition temperature of the fully _ isotropic _ model .",
    "this is exactly the feature of the gt line .",
    "overall , the obtained phase diagram is consistent with the experimental phase diagram of heisenberg - like sg magnets .",
    "@xcite in order to make a more quantitative comparison , however , we have to determine the phase boundary in the lower field regime @xmath46 more precisely , and to map out a phase diagram with varying the anisotropy strength @xmath24 .",
    "this is a computationally demanding task , and is left as a future task .     in the temperature - magnetic field plane .",
    "`` cg '' , `` sg '' and `` pm '' stand for the `` chiral - glass '' , `` spin - glass '' and `` paramagnetic '' phase , respectively . ]",
    "in summary , we performed a large - scale equilibrium monte carlo simulation of the weakly anisotropic 3d heisenberg sg in magnetic fields , paying attention both to the spin and to the chirality .",
    "the model is expected to be a reasonably realistic model of many real heisenberg - like sg magnets . due to the presence of both the random anisotropy and the magnetic field",
    ", the model lacks in any global symmetry so that the transition , if any , is expected to be a pure rsb one . among other things , we have found a clear numerical evidence that such a pure rsb transition indeed occurs at a finite temperature simultaneously in the spin and in the chiral sectors .",
    "the temporal decay of the time correlation functions of the chirality and of the spin , as well as the overlap distribution function of the chirality and the spin , gave a strong numerical evidence of the occurrence of a thermodynamic rsb transition in applied fields .",
    "we feel this finding for the weakly anisotropic heisenberg sg to be rather remarkable , in view of the long controversy in the community concerning the in - field ordering properties of the ising sg , which apparently looks much simpler .",
    "indeed , a comparison with the 3d ising sg in fields have revealed that the weakly anisotropic heisenberg sg in fields behaves differently from the ising sg in fields , a sign of the rsb transition being much clearer in the weakly anisotropic heisenberg sg than in the ising sg .",
    "the observed stronger sign of the rsb transition is closely connected to the one - step - like nature of its rsb pattern , which is certainly not the case in the ising sg .",
    "such a difference in the ordering properties of the two models might at first sound surprising , since the ising sg in fields and the weakly anisotropic heisenberg sg in fields share the same symmetry property .",
    "however , in spite of the similarity in symmetry , a significant difference exists in the two models in that the ising sg does not possess any chirality degree of freedom in contrast to the weakly anisotropic heisenberg sg . then , our observation highlights the possible importance of the chirality in realizing the rsb transition in the weakly anisotropic heisenberg sg .",
    "this gives a strong support to the chirality scenario of the sg transition of heisenberg - like sgs.@xcite    we also have found that the sign of the rsb transition is often observed more strongly in the chirality - related quantities than in the spin - related quantities . for example , the second peak of the overlap distribution function shows up clearly even from smaller lattices for the chirality , but more weakly and only for larger lattices for the spin : compare fig.8(a ) and fig.9(a ) .",
    "this observation seems consistent with the chirality scenario that the order parameter of the transition is the chirality whereas the spin is recoupled to the chirality beyond a certain crossover ( recoupling ) length scale of about @xmath47 lattice spacings .",
    "we have also observed that the behaviors of certain spin - related quantities , _",
    "e.g. _ , the binder ratio or the normalized correlation length , differ between in smaller and in larger lattices , the borderline size being around @xmath48 .",
    "again , these behaviors could naturally be explicable on the basis of the spin - chirality decoupling - recoupling scenario.@xcite    we also have constructed a rough @xmath3-@xmath41 phase diagram of the model .",
    "it has turned out that @xmath2 is rapidly suppressed by weak applied fields , @xmath49 , but is then kept almost unchanged up to rather higher fields of @xmath50 .",
    "the phase boundary in the weak field regime resembles the at - line , while that in the high field regime resembles the gt line , although its nature is very different from the mean - field at- or gt - line.@xcite these features of the phase diagram are consistent with the experimental result of the weakly anisotropic heisenberg sg .",
    "@xcite the obtained phase diagram is also fully consistent with the one expected from the chirality scenario .",
    "@xcite indeed , the chirality scenario predicts that , in the low - field regime where the anisotropy is important , the change in the broken symmetry from the zero - field case causes a crossover , accompanied with a rapid suppression of the transition temperature , while in the high - field regime where the anisotropy is negligible relative to the applied magnetic field , the sg transition line should essentially be given by the chiral - glass transition line of the fully isotropic system.@xcite    another remarkable feature of the present phase diagram is that the gt - like phase boundary is quite robust against magnetic fields , extending without much reduction to the field at least as twice large as the zero - field transition temperature .",
    "such a robustness of the sg ordered phase under fields is also in accord with the chirality scenario , since the chirality , regarded as a hidden order parameter of the sg transition , is only weakly coupled to the magnetic field .",
    "note that the magnetic field couples directly to the spin via the zeeman term in the hamiltonian , not to the chirality , while the effective coupling between the field and the chirality is rather weak .",
    "thus , overall , our observations on the weakly anisotropic heisenberg sg gives a strong support to the spin - chirality decoupling - recoupling scenario .",
    "@xcite in other words , it would be difficult to interpret all of our present observations based on the more conventional view that the spin is the order parameter of the transition and the chirality is just a composite ( secondary ) .",
    "a decisive test of the spin - chirality decoupling - recouping scenario would be to directly probe the chiral - glass order .",
    "recently , a proposal was made concerning the way to measure the linear and the nonlinear chiral susceptibilities of canonical sgs by using the hall probe , together with the scaling prediction from the spin - chirality decoupling - recoupling scenario .",
    "@xcite interestingly , very recent experiments have given support to these predictions from the chirality scenario .",
    "@xcite    in concluding this paper , we wish to emphasize again that , even if one sets aside the question of the detailed mechanism of the sg transition or the validity of the chirality scenario , the present numerical results have demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that the weakly anisotropic heisenberg sg exhibits a thermodynamic rsb transition in applied magnetic fields . in view of the fact that the property of the apparently simpler , strongly anisotropic ising sg still remains unclear in spite of the long controversy",
    ", this finding seems surprising and somewhat ironical .",
    "clarifying the relation between the weakly anisotropic heisenberg sg possessing the chiral degree of freedom and the strongly anisotropic ising sg not possessing the chiral degree of freedom is still open , and is left for future studies .",
    "the numerical calculation was performed on the hitachi sr8000 at the supercomputer system , issp , university of tokyo , and pentium iv clustering machines in our laboratory .",
