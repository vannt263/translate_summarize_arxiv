    "meg is an experiment designed to improve significantly the limits on the branching ratio ( br ) of the @xmath4 decay @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this decay channel is strongly suppressed in the standard model but is allowed to a measurable level in many alternative theories @xcite . + the topology of this decay is very simple , consisting of monochromatic @xmath3 and @xmath5 with a common space time origin , with energy close to half the @xmath6 mass , moving in opposite directions .",
    "these features can be summarized as    * @xmath7 * @xmath8 * @xmath9 * @xmath10 * @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the origin space vertex , @xmath13 the origin time , @xmath14 the relative polar angle and @xmath15 the energy .",
    "+ the main difficulty in this measurement is that , in order to collect the high statistic required to improve the existing br in a few years , a very high rate of @xmath6 must decay on the target : @xmath16 is the design value .",
    "the michel decay @xmath17 produces @xmath3 with an energy up to @xmath18 , therefore high resolution energy measurement is required to reduce the michel @xmath3 contamination .",
    "+ the @xmath5 background originates from radiative decay ( rd ) @xmath19 , @xmath20 annihilation in flight and @xmath3 bremsstrahlung .",
    "the kinematic limit is @xmath21 and therefore background suppression needs high resolution measurement of @xmath22 . +",
    "the @xmath5 and @xmath3 directions and the @xmath3 vertex need to be measured with high precision to discriminate combinatorial background from random association of @xmath3 and @xmath5 from different @xmath6 decays .",
    "precise measurements of @xmath23 and @xmath24 reduce the combinatorial background from different @xmath6 decays .",
    "+ the photon detector is a liquid xenon calorimeter ( lxe ) exploiting scintillation light @xcite that provides a measurement of the photon energy , position and timing .",
    "+ the positron is observed by a spectrometer having at the core a set of 16 low mass drift chambers ( dch ) embedded in a high magnetic field ( @xmath25 ) with a gradient along the z axis to bend the positron with a radius weakly dependent on the emission polar angle .",
    "the dch measures the @xmath3 momentum and position but is unable to deliver trigger information and to provide precise timing @xcite .",
    "the trigger and timing information on the @xmath3 are delivered by the timing counter , that is described in detail in the following .",
    "the tc is required to cover the solid angle opposite to the lxe providing high efficiency for @xmath3 detection .",
    "this requirement is satisfied dividing the tc in two modules , called sectors , placed symmetrically with respect to the decay target .",
    "each sector must provide a precise measurement of the @xmath3 timing both at the trigger and analysis levels ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "furthermore it provides a measurement of the crossing point both for the trigger , requiring the @xmath3 and @xmath5 moving in opposite direction , and for the analysis , dch - tc match and determination of the @xmath3 track path length .",
    "+ these requirements are met with a two layer detector : the outer one measures the transverse coordinate ( @xmath27 with respect to the beam direction ) and provides in addition time information for trigger and analysis .",
    "the inner one measures the longitudinal coordinate ( @xmath28 along the beam direction ) providing trigger and analysis information .",
    "the outer layer consists of 15 scintillator bars located along the z - axis at fixed radius ( @xmath29 ) in a barrel - like array with 10.5@xmath30 gap ( see fig.[megtc ] ) .",
    "this configuration has high acceptance for @xmath0 decay with momentum @xmath31 and reduced acceptance for michel events .",
    "the number of bars is matched to the number of dch and to the trigger requirement for selecting collinear @xmath32 .",
    "the bars have a square section with edge @xmath33 and length @xmath34 and are read by fine - mesh pmts adequate for use in high intensity magnetic field . the criteria leading to the choice of these parameters",
    "are explained in @xcite .",
    "+ the signals from the pmts are processed by a double threshold discriminator ( dtd ) with a low threshold to reduce time walk effect and a high threshold to remove background events . when the dtd is fired , it delivers a nim signal .",
    "+ the pmt and the nim signals are read by the domino ring sampler a custom designed digitizer operating in meg at frequency up to 2ghz @xcite .",
    "the full waveforms are stored so that the time can be extracted offline with optimized algorithms .",
    "the inner layer is made of 256 @xmath35 scintillating fibers providing trigger and analysis information on the @xmath28 coordinate @xcite ( see fig.[megtc ] ) .",
    "each fiber is read out by apds ( avalanche photo diode ) that allow operations in high intensity transverse magnetic field with a gain @xmath36 .",
    "+ the analog signal from the apd are filtered , 16 of them are summed and made available to the trigger . in parallel , the signals are discriminated and the digital hitmap is made available for the analysis .",
    "the longitudinal layers started taking data in 2006 and have been active during the following years . to achieve the design resolution , it turned out necessary to calibrate carefully the detector .",
    "+ the calibration tools naturally available are the large flux of michel @xmath3 from @xmath6 decays and the cosmic rays .",
    "there are two other calibration sources requiring a dedicated set up .",
    "a @xmath37 beam impinging on a liquid @xmath38 target produces through charge exchange reaction dalitz decays @xmath39 .",
    "protons of kinetic energy @xmath40 from a custom cockroft - walton accelerator produces on a boron target the nuclear reaction @xmath41 .",
    "+ important calibration items are the time walk ( tw ) terms that account for the amplitude dependence of the timing measurement .",
    "they are measured using @xmath3 hitting two or three bars .",
    "the same events are used to measure the tc time resolution .",
    "+ other crucial calibration is the measurement of timing offset of the different pmts to allow combining results from different part of the tc .",
    "this calibration is obtained with the dalitz or boron events , that have two particles emitted at the same time , using the lxe as reference .",
    "+ the single bar time resolutions with tw correction and offset subtracted are shown in fig.[barreso ] .",
    "+ the transverse layer worked only partially due to problems with the digital readout and excess noise , that prevented an efficient use of the detector . with the data available",
    ", it was possible to verify that the tracks reconstructed from dch match the hits on both transverse and longitudinal layers reducing the combinatorial background and delivering improved information on the @xmath3 track length .",
    "the tc of meg has performed as high resolution timing detector according to the expectations playing a crucial role in the meg trigger system .",
    "the transverse layer met unexpected problems with part of the digital readout , but the working part delivered satisfactory results .",
    "for the 2010 run , both layers are expected to be fully operational .",
