    "part of the interest of the @xmath0-catalan polynomials is that there are many different ways of defining @xmath6 ; the equivalence of these definitions is a deep result of algebraic combinatorics due to garsia , haglund , and haiman  @xcite .",

    "we show that if the set of initial points and the set of terminal points of all the chains are linked by a certain joint symmetry property , then the generating function for the entire set is jointly symmetric .",
    "we use our method to give a combinatorial proof of the joint symmetry of @xmath1 and @xmath87 for triangles of height at most 4 and all choices of the slope parameters @xmath29 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 .",

    "our method has the added benefit of providing explicit formulas for all the coefficients of @xmath1 for @xmath4 , as well as providing the foundation for our proof of conjecture  [ conj : qtcat ] for these values of @xmath2 .",
