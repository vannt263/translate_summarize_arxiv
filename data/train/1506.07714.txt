    "in photoemission experiments , photo - electrons carry information of many - body interactions created by the photo - hole and by the escaping photo - electron itself . in the case of strong coupling between the photo - hole or induced density caused by the photo - electron , and plasmon excitations , the quasi particle picture breaks down and",

    "a challenge is to find out about the relative occurrence of the _ intrinsic _ and _ extrinsic _ plasmarons from a photoemission experiment . in this paper",
