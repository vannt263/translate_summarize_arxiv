    "later on maki showed that the abrikosov lattice is a stable solution to the ginzburg - landau equations for arbitrary @xmath3 provided that the film thickness is sufficiently small  @xcite .",
    "the work of maki was continued by lasher who predicted that , between thick type i films that are in the intermediate state and thin films that are in the mixed state , there is a transitional area where giant vortices form honeycomb lattices and possibly more complex structures  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical work on these giant vortex structures is mostly based on linearized ginzburg - landau equations with the exception of a few recent numerical papers  @xcite .",
    "the current methods in numerical modelling allow us to solve the complete ginzburg - landau equations to address the problem of the complex giant vortex structures in type - i superconductors .",

    "we have numerically determined the local energy minima of the ginzburg - landau functional for a series of thin films of different thicknesses .",
    "the results show stable giant vortex configurations at certain thicknesses and a change in the size of vortices with film thickness .",

    "the larger vortices are giant vortices with vorticities of all values up to six .",
    "all the vortex lattices have a strongly disordered triangular lattice which is partly due to the low value of @xmath3 . as we have shown in our earlier work ( ref .",

    "the distinction between a cylindrically symmetric giant vortex with the vortex cores all exactly centered and a multivortex with the vortex cores very closely packed together is quite subtle .",

    "the change of the vortex size with film thickness was quantified by considering an effective coherence length @xmath38 and an effective penetration depth @xmath39 .",
    "the effective coherence length was defined by looking at how the order parameter changes near the sample surface , _ i.e. _ the absolute value of the order parameter should approach zero as @xmath40 $ ] and the magnetic field should decrease into the superconductor from the surface as @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "these were fitted to the average order parameter and field profiles of the samples where the averaging was done to the middlemost splice perpendicular to the magnetic field averaged over the periodic direction .",
    "examples of the fits to the order parameter profile and magnetic field profile are shown in .",
    "the fits were limited to the region where the profile is linear in semi - log plot near the sample boundary .",
    "the accuracy of the fits is better in the thicker samples where the vortices are not so near the boundary as in the thinner samples . for consistency ,",

    "thus , the fit results for a fixed sample thickness with different magnetic field values were averaged and are shown in .",
    "the standard deviations of the fit results for the same thickness are indicated with the error bars .",
    "the effective lengths @xmath38 and @xmath39 , given by the fits , decrease with increasing film thickness .",
    "the effective lengths for both @xmath3-values fall on the same curve when scaled with the bulk values @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the inset shows how the effective ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath45 is independent of the sample thickness .",
    "therefore , the effective lengths have the same thickness dependence which is shown as the black lines that have the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the only free parameter obtained by fitting . for @xmath48 equation  [ paksuus ] can also be written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "equation  [ pearl ] is quite similar to the @xmath51 given by pearl  @xcite for the interaction length of two pearl vortices in a thin superconducting film .",
    "both effective lengths diverge at @xmath52 and at thicknesses less than @xmath52 the simulation gives normal state as the minimum energy .",
    "the divergence of the effective lengths is obviously unphysical since , for example , pb thin films are superconducting down to 5 monolayer thicknesses  @xcite .",
    "however , the general trend that both effective lengths increase as the thickness decreases is in agreement with experiments that show how the critical field decreases ( @xmath53 ) as the thickness decreases  @xcite .",
    "the decrease of the critical field with decreasing thickness continues up to the point when the thickness of the sample starts to restrict the electron mean free path after which the critical field starts to increase  @xcite .",
    "since the electron mean free path related effects are not included in our model it is natural that the simulation results start to deviate from the experiments when the mean free path becomes important for the real sample .",
    "it is the stray field outside the sample that is responsible for the change in effective lengths and vortex - vortex interaction with film thickness .",
    "this is in good agreement with the work of brandt in ref .",
    "@xcite that shows when taking the stray fields into account the vortex lattice behaves like it had an effective @xmath3 that tends to infinity as thickness goes to zero .",
    "the effective @xmath3 in brandt s work is defined through the behaviour of the bulk shear modulus of the vortex lattice which reflects the change in the vortex - vortex interaction to repulsive . in this work",
    "@xmath54 stays constant as it is defined by the ratio of the effective lengths which differs from brandt s definition .",
    "the result that @xmath54 stays constant is interesting , because the vortices seen in thin type i films are explained with electron mean free path increasing @xmath3 which drives the material into type ii behaviour .",
    "our simulations predict that singly quantized vortices could be stabilized just by the geometry of the sample .",
    "an alternative viewpoint to effective @xmath3 is to consider how the expansion of vortices near the surface strengthens the repulsive interaction of vortices which leads to enhanced repulsion in thinner films  @xcite .",
    "and @xmath39 derived from the fits in as a function of the film thickness .",

    "the clem model gives a rather good estimate of the single vortex shape near the core .",
