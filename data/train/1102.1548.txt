    "accreting neutron stars ( nss ) in low mass x - ray binaries show bright type i x - ray bursts .",
    "these begin with a rapid increase of the x - ray flux ( the rise ) followed by a slow decrease ( the tail ) to the pre - burst luminosity , and last @xmath010 - 100 s. these bursts are powered by thermonuclear runaways , which burn up a layer of accumulated light elements on the ns surface ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "a significant fraction of bursts display quasi - periodic modulations , known as burst oscillations ( bos , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the discovery paper",
    ", @xcite suggested that bos were related to the spin frequency of the ns .",
    "this has been confirmed in five accretion - powered millisecond x - ray pulsars ( amxps ) , where it was found that bo frequencies are within a few percent of the spin frequencies @xcite .",
    "this implies that bos are caused by a near - stationary temperature asymmetry which persists in the surface layers of the star during burst .",
    "the detailed phenomenology of bos , however , is diverse . in the sources which have evidence for substantial magnetic fields ( the persistent amxps ) , for example , bos",
    "appear at a near constant frequency in the tail , with some fast chirps in the rise @xcite . in the intermittent amxps , and nss without evidence for a dynamically important magnetic field ,",
    "bos typically drift upwards by a few hertz during the burst @xcite .",
    "both the origin of the surface temperature asymmetry that causes the bos , and the reason for the observed frequency drifts , remain unsolved puzzles .",
    "one possibility is that the asymmetry is caused by global modes ( waves ) that develop in the bursting ocean @xcite .",
    "as the ocean cools , its scale height @xmath1 decreases and the pattern speed , which scales as @xmath2 , changes , leading to frequency drift .",
    "the kind of modes that might be excited include r - modes @xcite , g - modes @xcite or magneto - hydrodynamical modes @xcite . to date none of these models have managed to explain both the observed frequencies and the magnitude of the drifts ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an alternative possibility is that a compact burning hot - spot develops on the surface @xcite .",
    "the question is then how confinement , of fuel or the flame front itself , might be achieved . for unmagnetized stars",
    ", the coriolis force could be an effective confining mechanism ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter slu02 ) .",
    "although lifting and expansion of the hot fluid should cause spreading of the burning fuel , the coriolis force would oppose such motion of the flame front by deflecting its velocity .",
    "this mechanism could account for the presence of oscillations in the burst rise , although it does not easily explain the presence of bos in the tail or the frequency drifts .",
    "the coriolis force was however attractive in that it could explain why bos had not been seen in any ns with spin frequency @xmath3 hz ( since for more slowly rotating stars the coriolis force is not dynamically relevant , see sec .",
    "[ sec_coriolis ] ) .",
    "a strong magnetic field could also lead to confinement of fuel or flame , with the restoring force supplied by field pressure or stress .",
    "this mechanism is particularly plausible for accreting pulsars , where the existence of dynamically important magnetic fields is suggested by the presence of accretion - powered pulsations ( apps ) .    since there is no model that definitively explains all features of bo phenomenology , it is important to explore the applicability of the models under the widest possible range of conditions . until now , however , the only stars to show bos were rapid rotators with @xmath4 hz .",
    "this situation has changed with our discovery of burst oscillations @xcite from the accreting pulsar igr j174802446 ( hereafter j17480 ) , which rotates an order of magnitude more slowly at @xmath0 11 hz @xcite .",
    "j17480 was detected in outburst on 10 october 2010 in a galactic bulge scan with integral @xcite .",
    "the source is located in the globular cluster terzan 5 and its outburst lasted for @xmath055 days ( according to maxi monitoring observations ) before the source became undetectable due to solar constraints .",
    "further monitoring observations by maxi showed that the source had probably returned to quiescence by january 2011 .",
    "j17480 is an 11 hz pulsar in a 21.3 hr orbit around a companion with @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "follow - up observations of _ rxte_/pca have collected approximately 294 ks of data to 19 november 2010 .",
    "we used all _",
    "rxte_/pca @xcite public observations of j17480 taken between mjd 55482.0 and 55519.2 ( october 13-november 19 , 2010 ) . for our coherent timing analysis we used event and goodxenon data modes , keeping only absolute channels 537 ( @xmath6 kev ) , rebinned to @xmath7 s and barycentered with the ftool ` faxbary ` using the position of @xcite .",
    "we estimate the flux during each observation from the background subtracted @xmath8 kev crab normalized intensity ( estimated following * ? ? ? * ) and converted it to @xmath9 assuming a crab spectrum for the source .",
    "flux is converted into luminosity using a distance of 5.5 kpc @xcite .",
    "luminosity @xmath10 is converted into mass accretion rate @xmath11 using @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath11 obtained is approximate , since the x - ray flux is not bolometric , and no correction has been applied for absorption , the unknown disc inclination or gravitational redshift .",
    "conversion of bolometric luminosity to mass accretion rate is further complicated by the uncertainty in the radiative efficiency .",
    "the overall uncertainty on @xmath11 is within a factor @xmath0 3 , taking into account all these corrections @xcite .",
    "the lowest luminosity observed gives @xmath13 ( in the first observation ) while at the outburst peak @xmath14 , i.e. , 5% and 37% of the eddington rate @xmath15 ( assuming solar composition for the accreted gas ) .      bursts were identified visually in a 1 s lightcurve .",
    "the beginning and end of the bursts were defined as the points where the flux first and last exceeded the maximum pre - burst flux in the same observation .",
    "typical burst length is @xmath16 s. burst recurrence time and burst peak - to - persistent flux ratio decrease with increasing persistent flux until the outburst peak when the bursts disappear and millihertz quasi - periodic oscillations @xcite appear .",
    "as the outburst flux decreases again , the bursts gradually reappear with recurrence time and burst peak - to - persistent flux ratio increasing with decreasing flux @xcite . between",
    "mjd 55486 and mjd 55492 the difference between bursts and persistent flux fluctuations becomes negligible and burst recurrence time is of the same order as the duration of the bursts themselves , therefore burst rise and tail become difficult to define . in this case",
    "we do not identify the bursts , and for the purpose of measuring the oscillations treat all data as persistent flux .    using this identification criterion , we found 231 bursts .",
    "as discussed by other authors , some showed clear spectral evidence for cooling @xcite , were observed when the persistent luminosity was @xmath17 eddington and were identified conclusively as type i ( thermonuclear ) bursts ( fig .",

    "this means that in some cases ( when the signal is sufficiently strong ) multiple bo profiles are constructed for each burst .",
    "only pulse harmonics with snr@xmath25 were retained ( i.e. , harmonics whose amplitude was larger than 3.5 times the amplitude standard deviation ) , giving less than 1 false pulse detection .",
    "each pulse profile was decomposed into the fundamental frequency and overtones to compute fractional amplitudes and phases ( we were able to identify up to five overtones in some intervals ) .",
    "the pulse phases of each profile were calculated for each harmonic and analyzed separately .",
    "the method applied is described in @xcite , along with the procedure to calculate pulse amplitudes and statistical errors .",

    "burst oscillations were detected in all 231 bursts identified .",
    "fig . [ fracamp ] shows the fractional amplitudes of the bos compared to those of the apps .",
    "the fractional amplitudes of bos are always of the same order or larger than those of apps , and always significantly larger than expected if the modulations stem only from residual persistent emission .",
    "the detection of bos can therefore be considered secure .",
    "note that the app contribution has not been subtracted when calculating bo fractional amplitudes and phases .",
    "the measured bo fractional amplitudes are comparable to or higher than the app ones , it can be seen from eq . ( 11 ) of @xcite and eq .",

    "the presence of timing noise , as seen in other amxps @xcite complicates timing analysis of apps and bos .",

    "however adjacent bos and apps are always phase coincident and phase locked to within @xmath26 cycles . in the first observation , for example , which has the highest snr , the phase difference between the peak of the fundamental for apps and bos is @xmath27 cycles ( @xmath28 deg ) .",
    "this coincidence of results is remarkable given the strong timing noise , highlighting the fact that bos do indeed closely track apps .    to check",

    "[ powerspec ] ) , the frequencies of apps ( 11.044881(2 ) hz ) and bos ( 11.04493(7 ) hz ) are identical within the errors ( @xmath29 hz ) .    comparing the properties of j17480 to those of the other persistent pulsars with bos @xcite",

    "j17480 is most similar to j1814 : bos are present throughout the bursts , bos and apps are phase - locked very closely , bos have strong harmonic content and no measurable frequency drifts . j1808 and j17511 , by contrast , have bos with weaker harmonic content , which do not persist throughout the bursts , and display fast drifts in the rise . in terms of bo amplitude ,",
    "the persistent pulsars differ : j1808 has amplitudes of 3 - 5% r.m.s . , j17511 of 5 - 15% and j1814 of 9 - 15% .",
    "j17480 has bo amplitude of 30% r.m.s . in the first burst ,",
    "dropping to @xmath30 thereafter .",
    "however , in all cases the bo amplitude is comparable to ( within a few percent ) the app amplitude .",
    "we first show how we can exclude mode and coriolis force confinement models based on the coincidence of bo and app frequencies and on slow rotation .      given a mode with azimuthal number @xmath31 and frequency @xmath32 in the rotating frame of the star ,",
    "the frequency @xmath33 an inertial observer would measure is @xmath34 the sign of @xmath32 being positive or negative , depending on whether the mode is prograde or retrograde .    in the first , and best constrained burst ( section [ bosc ] ) ,",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath35 were found to differ by no more than @xmath36 hz .",
    "excluding modes with @xmath37 , which can not explain the high fractional amplitudes ( @xmath38 ) observed in the first burst @xcite , leaves us with two main possibilities .",
    "the first is that we have modes with @xmath39 and m=0 ( prograde ) or m=2 ( retrograde ) . even though modes with frequencies around 10 hz , such as g - modes @xcite do exist",
    ", it would require extreme fine tuning of parameters for @xmath32 to match @xmath35 within @xmath40 hz .",
    "we are not aware of any mechanism that could tie the frequency of a mode so closely to the spin .    the second option would be to have prograde modes with @xmath41 and @xmath42 hz . however the process that excites a mode must have a time scale @xmath43 . in this case",
    "@xmath44 s , which is longer than the duration of the bursts .",
    "we therefore conclude that global modes can not explain the presence of bos in j17480",
    ".      for rapidly rotating stars , showed that burning could be confined , due to the effect of the coriolis force , over a length scale of order the rossby adjustment radius @xcite :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is mass in units of 1.4 m@xmath47 , @xmath48 radius in units of 10 km , @xmath49 the scale height of the burning fluid in units of 10 m and @xmath50(10 hz ) .    for j17480 , @xmath51 significantly exceeds the stellar radius : coriolis force confinement is not effective .",
    "so although this mechanism might be important for faster nss ( for @xmath52 hz , @xmath53 km ) , it can not cause bos in j17480 .",
    "having ruled out these two models , we now explore the possibility that the magnetic field could confine the hot - spot .",
    "we begin by placing limits on the strength of the magnetic field for this source , following the standard procedure outlined in @xcite . for the magnetic field to be strong enough to channel the accretion flow , and hence generate apps , the magnetospheric radius ( the point at which the magnetic field disrupts the disc ) must exceed the stellar radius .",
    "this gives a lower limit on the magnetic field .",
    "in addition , to avoid propeller effects ( which would inhibit accretion ) , the magnetospheric radius has to be lower than the corotation radius .",
    "this gives an upper limit on the magnetic field .",
    "using the accretion rates derived in section [ subsec_light ] we conclude that the magnetic field for j17480 is in the range @xmath54 to @xmath55 g ( see @xcite and @xcite for a detailed explanation of how to calculate the magnetic field ) .",
    "we now need to estimate whether this field is strong enough to confine the burning material in order to generate bos .",
    "we start by considering static fuel confinement .",
    "a mountain of accreted material induces a pressure gradient within the fuel .",
    "@xcite computed the field that can statically compensate for such a gradient by magnetic tension .",
    "confinement within an area of radius @xmath56 , at the ignition column - depth @xmath57 g/@xmath58 requires magnetic field    @xmath59    fuel confinement may however be ineffective due to mhd interchange or `` ballooning '' instabilities @xcite , which allow accreted fluid to escape the polar cap region and spread over the ns surface .",
    "nonetheless , confinement might still be achieved dynamically by the motion of the fluid itself .",
    "this is because such motion can induce a horizontal field component which can act to halt further spreading .",
    "this mechanism requires a weaker field    @xmath60    @xcite .    both of these estimates are compatible with the magnetic field inferred for this source from its accretion properties .",
    "we conclude that magnetic confinement of the burning fluid is a viable mechanism to explain the bos in j17480 .",
    "detailed theoretical studies will however be needed to verify this possibility , since it depends on poorly understood details of the interaction between the magnetic field and the hydrodynamics of the burning ocean .",
    "that said , confinement of burning material at the polar cap provides a natural explanation for the phase - locking and coincidence of the apps and bos ( see also * ? ? ? * ) and would explain why the amplitudes of the two sets of pulsations track each other as the accretion footprint varies during the outburst ( fig .",
    "[ fracamp ] ) .",
    "we have analyzed the bursts of the slowly rotating x - ray pulsar j17480 and found oscillations at the same frequency as the ns spin .",
    "we have shown that neither global modes nor a coriolis force confined hot - spot can explain the presence and frequency of these bos .",
    "we suggest that the magnetic field could potentially provide the necessary confining force for a hot - spot to persist .",
    "the field needs to be at least @xmath61 g and this requirement is compatible with the constraints set by the accretion process .",
    "this model would neatly explain the phase - locking of apps and bos , and the fact that the amplitudes of the two pulsations track each other .",
    "we noticed that among the other persistent amxps xte j1814 - 338 is the most similar one , showing almost constant frequency of the bos , harmonic content and remarkably phase locking .",
    "@xcite excluded the possibility of magnetic confinement , since using the estimates of @xcite ( eq . [ bb ] )",
    "the field was not strong enough to confine the fuel .",
    "however , they did not consider the case of dynamical confinement when spreading is allowed ( eq . [ hs ] ) .",
    "this operates at lower fields which are compatible with the magnetic field estimated for j1814 .",
    "this mechanism seem less likely for other amxps such as sax j1808.4 - 3658 and igr j17511 - 3057 , where the fields are lower @xcite and there are frequency drifts in the rising phase of bursts @xcite .",
    "that said , magnetic confinement would offer an explanation for the presence of higher harmonics in pulsar bos , since the emitting area would be bounded ( probably near the rotational poles , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    what about the non pulsating sources and the intermittent pulsars with a weaker magnetic field ?",
    "they do not show harmonic content and their bos show drifts during the decay of the bursts .",
    "if magnetic confinement were responsible one would expect to see apps from these sources as well . unless the field can be boosted temporarily to detectable levels only during the burst @xcite , a different mechanism",
    "may be required @xcite .",
    "if global modes or coriolis confinement are responsible , then the wider emitting surface involved , or the involvement of higher colatitudes , would suppress the presence of harmonics , in line with the observations @xcite ."
