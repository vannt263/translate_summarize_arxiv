    "s88b is a high mass star forming region ( near @xmath2 ) with a bolometric luminosity of @xmath3 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it has been observed at a wide variety of wavelengths .",
    "there is some confusing nomenclature in the literature , and so we begin by discussing the morphology of its surroundings .",
    "s88 is itself a diffuse extended nebula , and is likely a very evolved  region ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "about 14  to its southeast lie two bright knots of optical nebulosity : s88a and s88b ( e.g. , see the red palomar sky survey print in fig .  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "no radio continuum emission is observed from the western source , s88a .",
    "strong radio emission is observed from an  region centered slightly to the east of the optical nebulosity s88b , and this is the target source for our zeeman observations .",
    "@xcite  first proposed that the radio source in s88b was composed of two components , based on their 5 ghz continuum observations .",
    "the more extended component to the west ( e.g. , see ",
    "[ ssc ] , and fig .  1 in this paper ) that intersects the optical nebulosity is s88b-1 , whereas the compact component to the east is s88b-2 . in their high resolution 6",

    "following @xcite , we adopt the distance to s88b of 2.0 kpc .",
    "more recently , @xcite  have claimed a distance of 4.1 @xmath4 2.4 kpc to s88b on the basis of their h110@xmath5 recombination line and h@xmath6co absorption observations ; we note that our adopted value is within their error limits .",
    "moreover , @xcite  have estimated on the basis of foreground star counts that the distance to s88b can not be substantially greater than 2.0 kpc .",
    "the observations were carried out with the very large array ( vla ) of the nrao in 2003 in the b - configuration , and combined with c - configuration data observed in 1997 .",
    "important parameters of the observations are listed in table  [ top ] .",
    "both circular polarizations and both main lines ( 1665 and 1667 mhz ) of oh were observed simultaneously in absorption . in order to mitigate instrumental effects ,",
    "a front - end transfer switch was used to alternate the sense of circular polarization passing through each telescope s if system every @xmath710 minutes .",
    "the editing , calibration , fourier transformation , deconvolution , and calculation of optical depths for the oh data were carried out using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) of the nrao . following standard procedure for zeeman effect observations , bandpass correction was applied only to the stokes @xmath8 data set , since bandpass effects subtract out to first order in the stokes @xmath9 data , and the bandpass correction process adds noise to the @xmath9 profiles .",
    "the b and c configuration data were combined in the uv - plane using the aips task @xmath10 .",
    "the rms in the continuum image of the combined b and c configuration data is 0.8 mjy @xmath11 , whereas the rms in a channel of the line data is 1.7 mjy @xmath11 .",

    "we determined the integrated flux for s88b-1 to be @xmath13 jy , and the integrated flux for s88b-2 to be @xmath14 jy . in a 5 ghz continuum survey with the nrao 140-ft telescope ( hpbw 6@xmath155 ) ,",
    "@xcite  obtained 6.1 jy for the source 61.5 + 0.1 which is a combination of s88b-1 and s88b-2 . in a 12-hr synthesis map with westerbork ( wsrt ) at 5 ghz ( hpbw 6@xmath166 ) ,",

    "the optical depth profiles reveal complex kinematics with a number of heavily blended components present toward much of the region . in order to highlight the prominent absorption components , contour plots of the oh optical depth in several velocity channels",
    "are shown in figure [ ftau ] , superposed on a grayscale image of the 18 cm continuum .",
    "every third velocity channel is displayed , and the plots are shown over the velocity range 17.4 km @xmath28  to 24.0 km @xmath28 .",
    "figure  [ fnoh ]  shows plots of @xmath29(oh)/@xmath22 toward s88b at 1667 mhz . in principle , variations in @xmath29(oh)/@xmath22 may arise due to variations in the oh column density , or due to variations in @xmath22 , or both .",
    "however , in the results and discussion , we quote only variations in @xmath29(oh)/@xmath22 , since the excitation temperature can not be measured based on absorption studies alone . further discussion about possible variations in @xmath22 appears in   [ ssdc ] .    from figures [ ftau ]  and [ fnoh ] , we identified four prominent absorption enhancements , and these are marked in figure  [ fnoh ]  as oh - a , oh - b , oh - c , and oh - d respectively .",
    "the absorption enhancement oh - a lies to the southwest of the continuum peak of s88b-1 ; it is seen in the 19.1 km @xmath28  panel in figure  [ ftau ] , with a peak @xmath30 .",
    "oh - a is also seen in the 19.9 km @xmath28  panel of figures [ ftau ]  with a higher peak @xmath31 . in this 19.9 km @xmath28  panel",
    ", we also see the enhancements oh - b and oh - c , the former to the northwest of the continuum peak of s88b-1 , and the latter about midway between s88b-1 and s88b-2 .",
    "finally , oh - d is seen in the 20.7 , 21.5 , and 22.4 km @xmath28  panels of figure  [ ftau ] , with high peak @xmath32 in two of these panels ; it lies northward of the s88b-2 continuum peak ; oh - d is also visible at the highest velocities at which oh absorption is observed ( @xmath33 km @xmath28 ) . the high @xmath34 s in oh - d account for the peak in @xmath29(oh)/@xmath22 to the north of the continuum peak of s88b-2 .      the magnetic field strengths in s88b were determined using the zeeman effect , by fitting a numerical frequency derivative of the stokes @xmath8 spectrum to the stokes @xmath9 spectrum for each pixel in the absorption line cube .",
    "the stokes parameters have the standard definition of @xmath8 = ( rcp + lcp ) , and @xmath9 = ( rcp @xmath35 lcp ) ; rcp is right- and lcp is left - circular polarization ; rcp has the standard radio definition of clockwise rotation of the electric vector when viewed along the direction of wave propagation . since the observed @xmath9 spectrum may also contain a scaled replica of the @xmath8 spectrum itself , the stokes @xmath9 spectral profile can be described by the equation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) : @xmath36 in this equation , the fit parameter @xmath37 represents the scaled - down replica of the @xmath8 profile in the @xmath9 profile ; @xmath37 is usually the result of small calibration errors in @xmath38 vs.  @xmath39 ; for all results reported here , @xmath40 . for thermally excited lines such as the oh 1665 and 1667 mhz lines reported in this paper , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the magnetic field , @xmath43 is the angle of the magnetic field to the line of sight , and @xmath44 is the zeeman splitting factor which is equal to @xmath44 = 3.27 hz @xmath0g@xmath27 for the 1665 mhz line of oh , and 1.96 hz @xmath0g@xmath27 for the 1667 mhz line of oh ( @xcite ) .",
    "we determined magnetic field strengths in s88b by using a least- squares method to fit equation ( [ evlco ] ) to the stokes @xmath9 spectra to solve for @xmath37 and @xmath45 .",
    "the results of the fits give the line - of - sight component of the magnetic field , @xmath46  = @xmath47 .",
    "it is usual practice to consider the results to be significant only if the derived value of @xmath46  is greater than the 3@xmath48 level . for zeeman effect observations in oh absorption lines ,",
    "we usually impose a stronger condition  we consider the detections to be significant only if both 1665 and 1667 mhz @xmath46  values are greater than the 3@xmath48 level .",
    "in the current observations , however , this stronger criterion for significance would leave out some important information on the field . toward s88b-2 ,",
    "the 1665 mhz profiles show a @xmath7200 @xmath0 g field with about 5@xmath48 level of significance , whereas the 1667 mhz profiles show a field below the 3@xmath48 level .",
    "therefore , for s88b-2 only , we have relaxed the criterion above to consider the measurement to be significant if it displays a 3@xmath48 detection only in the 1665 mhz line .",
    "we believe this is reasonable , since the measured value of @xmath46   toward this source does not appear to be wildly discrepant from the measured value toward s88b-1 .",
    "the non - detection at 1667 mhz toward s88b-2 is not surprising .",
    "the 1667 mhz stokes v signal is weaker than the 1665 mhz stokes v signal because the zeeman splitting factor for oh 1667 mhz lines ( @xmath44 = 1.96 hz @xmath0g@xmath27 ) is less than that for oh 1665 mhz lines ( @xmath44 = 3.27 hz @xmath0g@xmath27 ) .",
    "this inequality in the zeeman factors would not impact the result as much if the oh gas was thermalized and homogenous , since the intensity ratios would then be @xmath49 .",
    "however , as described below (   [ ssdc ] ) , @xmath50 toward s88b , which makes the sensitivity of the 1667 mhz line to the zeeman effect less than that of the 1665 mhz line .    the resulting @xmath46  map ( taken from the 1665 mhz data ) is shown in figure  [ fblos ] . in the area enclosed by the thick - lined ellipse in this figure ,",
    "the detected field is above the 3@xmath48 level only in the 1665 mhz line , whereas in the rest of the displayed @xmath46  map , the field is above the 3@xmath48 level in both 1665 and 1667 mhz lines , with peak signal - to - noise ratios of @xmath710 .",
    "examples of the stokes @xmath8 and @xmath9 profiles together with the derivative of @xmath8 scaled by the fitted value of @xmath46are shown in figure  [ fb1ivd ] and figure  [ fb2ivd ] ; the locations toward which these profiles have been plotted are marked in figure [ fblos ] by a `` + '' and a `` @xmath51 '' respectively . from figure  [ fb1ivd ] and",
    "figure  [ fb2ivd ] , it is evident that the magnetic field is detected in the component with @xmath52 km @xmath28 ; no fields were detected in any of the other velocity components . toward s88b-1 , we see from figure  [ fblos ]  that @xmath46  increases from about 90 @xmath0 g in the southwest to about 400 @xmath0 g in the northeast ; this is the case in both 1665 and 1667 mhz lines .",
    "meanwhile , toward s88b-2 , the 1665 mhz line reveals values of @xmath46  as high as @xmath7270 @xmath0 g .",
    "early optical , radio , and infrared observations of s88b by @xcite revealed that the peak of the near infrared ( nir ) position is eastward of the optical nebula , whereas the radio continuum peak is even farther to the east than the nir peak .",
    "this eastward progression is consistent with our observation of the location of the absorbing oh gas .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ ftau ]  that almost all of the oh absorbing gas is located in the eastern half of s88b ( i.e. , all of s88b-2 , and the eastern part of the extended source s88b-1 ) .",
    "we did not detect any oh absorption in the western parts of s88b-1 , where it is coincident with the h@xmath5 nebulosity . the molecular cloud associated with s88b",
    "was mapped by @xcite  in several co transitions at low resolution ( hpbw 1@xmath53 - 2@xmath53 ) , and found to extend over 10@xmath53 ( 6.5 pc ) with a total mass of @xmath54 m@xmath55 .",
    "@xcite  speculated that the  regions s88b-1 and s88b-2 are a blister formation in the molecular cloud which we are observing from the side .",
    "the velocities of the absorbing oh gas match up well with molecular line velocities ; e.g. , the co lines are singly peaked at 21 km @xmath28  ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , recombination line observations by @xcite  with the vla ( hpbw @xmath7 2@xmath56 ) revealed that the center velocity of the single - peaked h92@xmath5 line emission toward s88b-1 increases from 22 km @xmath28  at the eastern edge of s88b-1 to 32 km @xmath28  at the western edge .",
    "the 22 km @xmath28  velocity in the h92@xmath5 recombination line at the eastern edge of s88b-1 matches well with the oh absorption data  e.g. , see the panels between 21.5 km @xmath28  and 22.4 km @xmath28  in figure  [ ftau ] . on the other hand , the recombination line velocity at the western edge matches well with the optical h@xmath5 velocities which exceed 28 km @xmath28  ( @xcite ) .",
    "in other words , we are observing an edge - on transition from the ionized gas to the molecular gas in s88b , similar to m17 ( @xcite ) .",
    "while the velocity structure of oh absorption observed by us toward s88b is complicated , the highest values for @xmath57 are to the north of the continuum peak s88b-2 .",
    "while this may , in principle , be due to variations in @xmath58 or @xmath59 or both , other tracers indicate that the column of absorbing gas is indeed greater in the eastern parts of s88b ( i.e. , toward s88b-2 ) . toward the h@xmath5 peak in the west , @xcite  found a relatively low @xmath60  = 5 mag . based on their observations of ir fine structure lines ,",
    "@xcite  measured @xmath60= 26 @xmath4 9 mag at the position of the 2.2 nir @xmath0 m peak .",
    "this 2.2 @xmath0 m peak was resolved by @xcite   into a system of three stars ( 82 , 83 , 84 ) located on the eastern edge of the optical nebulosity  their positions are marked in figure  [ fcc ] .",
    "in contrast , toward s88b-2 in the east , @xcite  found @xmath60@xmath7 70 mag by comparing their observed br@xmath5 flux with 5 ghz radio continuum data from the literature .",
    "s88b-2 also coincides with the 350 @xmath0 m dust continuum peak from @xcite , as shown in figure  2 .",
    "there is also an extension in the 350 @xmath0 m dust continuum image to the northwest , which coincides with the location of s88b-1 ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "in fact , due to the high obscuration toward the eastern parts of s88b , a complete census of the exciting / ionizing stars of s88b-1 and s88b-2 has proved impossible so far .",
    "@xcite  suggested that star 82 could be the ionizing / exciting source of s88b-1 , based on its high luminosity and central location ( see fig .",
    "[ fcc ] ) , but admitted the likelihood that other stars also contribute to the excitation / ionization in the region .",
    "other possible candidates for exciting sources are the stars l1 ( for s88b-2 ) and l2 ( for s88b-1 ) , detected by @xcite  at a near - infrared wavelength of 3.5 @xmath0 m ( l@xmath61-band ) and marked in figure  [ fcc ] ; however , the issue remains open because @xcite  could not determine the spectral type of l1 or l2 as they did not detect them in their j , h , or k@xmath61 near - infrared bands .",
    "if the absorbing oh gas is thermalized and homogenous ( i.e. , not clumpy within the observing beam ) , the ratio of the optical depths of the 1665 mhz and 1667 mhz lines should be @xmath62 .",
    "however , the observed profiles toward s88b do not show this ratio . instead , observed ratios @xmath63 are in the range 1.0 - 1.3 over most parts of the source . while it is likely that the excitation temperatures for the two lines at 1665 mhz and 1667 mhz are not the same , it is unlikely that this difference would cancel out the expected ratio of optical depths over the whole source .",
    "more likely , the oh gas is clumped on size scales smaller than the beam .",
    "such clumpiness has been found also in molecular emission lines .",
    "the co j=2@xmath351 and @xmath64co j=2@xmath351 and j=1@xmath350 data ( hpbw 22@xmath56 - 33@xmath56 ) of @xcite  reveal a horseshoe - like structure surrounding the optical nebulosity , which they ascribe to material excited along the periphery of an outflow cavity that encloses the optical nebula . indeed , @xcite  have reported a low collimation bipolar outflow extending over 3@xmath53 from their co observations ; this co outflow was also observed by @xcite .",
    "both the co and @xmath64co images in @xciteshow highly fragmented structure , in agreement with the clumpy structure suggested by the oh absorption observations .",
    "more evidence of clumping comes from observations of nh@xmath65 lines at high angular resolution ( hpbw 4@xmath56 ) with the vla by @xcite .",
    "they found compact ammonia structures with sizes of 0.2 pc toward both s88b-1 and s88b-2 .",
    "they suggest that these ammonia clumps correspond to compact molecular structures embedded within the larger molecular cloud , and that these clumps have been heated by the radiation from the star(s ) that ionize(s ) the associated  regions .",
    "finally , recent c@xmath66o observations by @xcite with a beam hpbw of 15  provide additional evidence of clumpy structure ( also see   [ ssmfe ] below ) ; their clump b is marked in figure  [ fcc ] .",
    "the oh excitation temperature @xmath22  ( which will be required in the calculations below ) can not be measured based on absorption studies alone , but reasonable limits for it can be set from our observations , and a likely value estimated based on other tracers .",
    "the minimum continuum @xmath67 against which the line is detected is @xmath7 10 mjy @xmath11   we can use this to set an upper limit on @xmath22 . using @xmath68",
    "1 mjy @xmath11@xmath69 17 k , we get an upper limit of 170 k for @xmath22 .",
    "it is also unlikely that @xmath22  is less than the typical dark cloud value of 10 k. estimates of the kinetic temperature from other molecular tracers are also relevant if we assume lte . from observations of the ( 2,2 ) and ( 3,3 ) lines of nh@xmath65",
    ", @xcite  found @xmath70 = 80 k toward s88b-1 ( their western nh@xmath65 clump ) and 70 k toward s88b-2 ( their eastern nh@xmath65 clump ) .",
    "based on co observations , @xcite  estimated @xmath70  @xmath7 60 k. @xcite  found a dust temperature for s88b equal to @xmath71  = 42 k. @xcite  fitted a 2-component dust model for s88b , and obtained @xmath71 = 40 k and 116 k. the higher @xmath72  may be due to compact embedded sources or it may reflect an enhanced population of small grains ( @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , @xcite  have reported observations of pah emission features toward s88b .",
    "@xcite  found t@xmath73 = 75 k from their 350 @xmath0 m dust continuum observations .",
    "we adopt @xmath22  = 60 k for our calculations , but note that @xmath22  likely varies over the source ; still , it must lie between 10 - 170 k.      our observations of the zeeman effect in oh absorption lines at 1665 and 1667 mhz have yielded @xmath46  values in the range of 90 to 400 @xmath0 g .",
    "these values are typical of magnetic fields in molecular clouds detected via the zeeman effect in the density regimes accessible via  and oh thermal lines , as tabulated in @xcite .",
    "note , however , that our detected fields are higher than the single dish measurements by @xcite , who found @xmath46  = 69 @xmath4 5 @xmath0 g toward s88b with the nancay single dish .",
    "this is expected , since the low angular resolution ( hpbw @xmath74 ) of nancay will cause fields to be averaged over a large area , leading to much lower @xmath46  values .",
    "the magnetic field in a cloud may consist of a static component @xmath75 , and a time - dependent or wave component @xmath76 .",
    "the static component connects the cloud to the external medium and determines the total magnetic flux throughout the cloud , but it can only provide support to the cloud perpendicular to the field lines .",
    "the wave component is associated with mhd waves in the cloud , and it can provide three dimensional support to the cloud . in principle , the observed @xmath46may consist of contributions from each of these two components . in reality , however , the zeeman effect likely traces the strength of the static component of the magnetic field only .",
    "this is because spatial averaging over the beam and along the line of sight tends to cancel the contribution from the wave component ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) . a principal goal of zeeman effect measurements , therefore",
    ", is to estimate the importance of the magnetic field to the dynamics and evolution of star forming regions like s88b . as summarized in @xcite",
    ", such estimates also require other physical parameters such as internal velocity dispersion , hydrogen column density , and radius , to be known .",
    "the relevant physical parameters mentioned above for estimating the importance of the magnetic field are available either from the present observations of s88b or from the literature .",
    "first , we must decide on an appropriate value for the radius .",
    "the highest resolution molecular line emission observations available to date are the c@xmath66o observations of @xcite  referred to above ( with beam hpbw 15@xmath56 ) .",
    "clumps b , c , and d in their observations all have radius @xmath7 0.2 pc . therefore",
    ", we adopt @xmath77 pc for the radius in all the following calculations .",
    "next , the hydrogen column density can be estimated from the oh line data , subject to certain assumptions .",
    "we use an average value of @xmath78/@xmath22  = 6.0 @xmath51 10@xmath79 @xmath80 k@xmath27 ( see fig .  [ fnoh ] ) . for the excitation temperature ,",
    "we use @xmath22  = 60 k , based on the discussion in   [ ssdc ]  above .",
    "then , to get @xmath81 , we use the conversion ratio @xmath82 from @xcite  for s106 .",
    "this makes the oh abundance a factor of 10 greater than that in dark clouds found by @xcite .",
    "note , however , that if we consider the standard conversion ratio @xmath83 , and use @xmath84 = 70 mag for s88b ( see   [ ssdc ]  above ) , we obtain @xmath85 , which justifies our use of the @xcite  value rather than the dark cloud value ; similar results were found for m17 by @xcite . using this conversion ratio , we get @xmath86 @xmath80 .",
    "this gives a hydrogen density @xmath87 @xmath88 , which compares well with the value of @xmath89 @xmath88 found by @xcite  for the clump designated as @xmath42 in their c@xmath66o observations ( see fig .  [ fcc ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting here that at lower resolution ( hpbw 30@xmath56 ) , @xcite  determined a mean @xmath90 @xmath88 .",
    "together , this is further proof of the clumping in s88b discussed in [ ssdc ]  above , since the larger beam filling factor in a higher angular resolution observation of a clumpy region will naturally give a larger value for the density .",
    "note , however , that the density can not be substantially greater than @xmath710@xmath91 @xmath88 , a conclusion reached by @xcite  based on the absence of h@xmath6co emission ( @xcite ) toward s88b . other parameters of interest are the velocity dispersion ( which can be obtained from the observed line width ) and the magnetic field ; the adopted values for the average observed line width of oh lines and the average @xmath46  in s88b are listed in table  [ tparms ] . for the calculations below , we will follow @xcite , and use total ( static ) magnetic field strength equal to 2 times @xmath46",
    ".    we can now proceed to assess the importance of the magnetic field in s88b , using a number of approaches .",
    "first , we consider the parameter @xmath92 , which is the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressures ( @xcite ) ; it is a crucial parameter in any theory or simulation of the structure and evolution of molecular clouds that incorporates magnetic fields . if @xmath93 , then magnetic fields are important ; the lower the value of @xmath92 , the more dominant is the magnetic field .",
    "based on the adopted values in table  [ tparms ] , we find @xmath94 in s88b , indicating the importance of the magnetic field in this region .",
    "our value for @xmath92 in s88b is similar to that in high mass star forming regions like dr 21 oh 1 , where @xmath95 , and w3 ( main ) , where @xmath96 ( @xcite , and references therein ) . another way to assess",
    "the importance of the magnetic field in s88 is to use the relation @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the average proton column density in the cloud .",
    "equation [ ebs ]  is a result of equating the static magnetic energy of the cloud to its gravitational energy ; @xmath99 is then the average static magnetic field in the cloud that would completely support it against self - gravity . if the actual static magnetic field in the cloud @xmath100 , then the cloud can be completely supported by the magnetic field , and is said to be magnetically subcritical .",
    "further evolution of the cloud perpendicular to the field lines will occur primarily via ambipolar diffusion .",
    "the field can be judged to be dynamically important to the region even if it is less than @xmath99 , but is comparable to it . for @xmath86 @xmath80  from table  [ tparms ]",
    "above , we get @xmath101 g . our average total ( static ) magnetic field strength (= 2 times @xmath46  in table  [ tparms ] ) is 400 @xmath0 g ; that is , the observed magnetic field strength is within a factor of @xmath72 less than the critical field .",
    "therefore , the magnetic field should be dynamically significant , providing an important source of support against self gravity .",
    "yet another parameter to judge the extent to which a static magnetic field can support a cloud against gravitational collapse is the observed mass to magnetic flux ratio @xmath102}$ ] , defined by @xcite  in units of the critical value .",
    "this is equivalent to the consideration of @xmath99 , and may be redundant here , but we state it nevertheless to express our results in this alternative language . if the ratio of observed @xmath102}$ ] to the critical value is greater than 1 , then the region is magnetically supercritical , meaning that the magnetic field can not by itself provide support against gravitational collapse .",
    "for s88b , we find the observed @xmath102}$ ] in units of the critical value to be 1.8 .",
    "this is consistent with observations to date ; @xcite  found the observed @xmath102}$ ] in terms of the critical value to have an average value equal to 2 in a summary of available zeeman measurements in molecular clouds .",
    "the calculated value for s88b indicates that whereas the static magnetic field by itself is not enough to support the molecular cloud against gravitational collapse , it is high enough to provide a significant source of support .",
    "perhaps more important , however , in a highly supersonic medium like the s88b molecular cloud , is that for the magnetic field to be important , its energy density must be comparable to , or greater than , the turbulent energy density .",
    "the supersonic nature of the medium is clear from the value of the sonic mach number @xmath103 given in table 3 ; from it , we have that the ratio of the one - dimensional velocity dispersion ( @xmath48 ) to the isothermal sound speed ( @xmath104 ) in s88b is @xmath105 .",
    "this is a common result in molecular clouds ; in his compilation of results for 27 molecular clouds , @xcite  found that motions are supersonic by about a factor of 5 .",
    "table 3 also lists the alfvenic mach number ( @xmath106 ) to be equal to 1 .",
    "this implies that the magnetic energy density is comparable to the turbulent energy density , that is , these two energies are in approximate equipartition .",
    "finally , we can use the measured @xmath46  to assess the relative importance of the gravitational , kinetic , and magnetic energy terms @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 , in the virial equation ( @xcite ) . to calculate their values",
    ", we use the expressions for @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 given in @xcite ; the values are given in table  [ tve ] .",
    "we find that @xmath110 , again indicating that magnetic fields are a significant , but not the sole , means of support against gravitational collapse .",
    "finally , we find that @xmath111 ; however , the surface pressure term in the virial equation , which is not included here , will act in the same sense as gravity ; therefore , s88b is in approximate virial equilibrium .",
    "we have observed oh thermal lines in absorption at 1665 and 1667 mhz toward the star forming region s88b with the aim of mapping magnetic fields via the zeeman effect .",
    "the oh absorption line profiles toward this source are complicated , and contain several blended components toward a number of positions .",
    "the oh absorbing gas is located in the eastern parts of s88b , toward s88b-2 and the eastern section of s88b-1 .",
    "the ratio of optical depths @xmath50 over most parts of the source , instead of the value of 1.8 for thermalized and homogenous oh gas .",
    "this is most likely due to clumping of oh gas , a conclusion supported by observations of co , @xmath64co , nh@xmath65 and c@xmath66o emission lines from the literature . from the @xmath57 plots",
    ", we identified 4 prominent oh clumps , which we have designated as oh - a , oh - b , oh - c , and oh - d .",
    "the highest values for @xmath57 are to the north of the continuum peak s88b-2 .",
    "although this could , in principle , be due to an enhancement in @xmath58 or @xmath22  ( or both ) , it is likely that north of s88b-2 is truly the location of the largest column of absorbing oh gas , as supported by independently measured extinction values toward s88b from the literature .",
    "based on the observed quantities and adopted values of parameters from the literature , we obtain a gas density @xmath87 @xmath88 , which compares well with the value of @xmath112 @xmath88  found by @xcite   for a c@xmath66o clump coincident with the s88b-1 and s88b-2 sources .    in brief , s88b appears to have an overall geometry similar to m17 , in that there is an edge - on progression from ionized to molecular gas going eastward .",
    "our magnetic field map appears to mirror this transition , at least over the extended s88b-1 region , where we detected line - of - sight magnetic fields ranging from 90 - 400 @xmath0 g , with the lowest values to the southwest of the s88b-1 continuum peak , and the highest values to its northeast . toward s88b-2 ,",
    "the fields are significant at the 3-@xmath48 level in the 1665 mhz line only , and are detected over a small region but if we had the sensitivity to keep going eastward , the field would likely follow the same increasing trend .",
    "the detected fields allow us to assess the importance of the magnetic field in s88b , using a number of methods .",
    "we find that the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressures , @xmath113 ; a value of @xmath93 means that magnetic fields are important ; the lower the value of @xmath92 , the more dominant the magnetic field . a second method to assess",
    "the importance of the magnetic field is to compare the observed magnetic field with the critical field that would be required to completely support the cloud against its self - gravity .",
    "we find that the observed magnetic field is within a factor of 2 less than the critical field .",
    "a third method to assess the importance of the magnetic field , equivalent to the second , is to find the ratio of observed mass to magnetic flux in terms of the critical value ; for s88b , we find this to be 1.8 .",
    "these considerations lead us to conclude that the magnetic field in s88b is dynamically significant , and provides an important source of support against gravity .",
    "moreover , the magnetic energy density is comparable to the turbulent energy density , implying that these two energies are in approximate equipartition , and pointing again to the importance of the magnetic field in this region .",
