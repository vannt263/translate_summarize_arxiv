    "vortex nucleation in an infinite type - ii superconductor becomes energetically favorable at lower critical field @xmath1 .",
    "it is however clear that real superconductors are always bounded , so that vortices can appear in a sample , at low temperatures , only by penetration through surfaces .",
    "this process was for the first time considered by bean and livingston@xcite within the framework of the london approximation . in their approach ,",
    "single vortex was represented by a straight line entering a semi - infinite sample through its surface .",
    "bean and livingston have found a surface barrier preventing such an entry .",
    "the barrier disappears when @xmath2is close to the thermodynamical critical field @xmath3 , which is much larger than @xmath1 in superconductors with high values of the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "physically , bean - livingston barrier is a consequence of the competition between the two factors : ( i ) the interaction between the vortex and the meissner current , which tries to push the vortex line inside the sample ; ( ii ) the magnus attraction of a vortex to the surface , which can be understood in terms of the interaction between the vortex and its mirror image ( `` antivortex '' ) .",
    "similarly , surface barrier exists for the vortex exit from the sample .",
    "bean - livingston barrier plays an important role in the vortex dynamics near the superconductor surface and leads to pronounced hysteresis effectsbrandt .    as any potential barrier",
    ", bean - livingston barrier can be surmounted by thermal activation .",
    "this phenomenon was addressed by petukhov and chechetkin@xcite , who have considered vortex nucleus as a half - loop spreading from the surface into the bulk .",
    "the profile of the surface barrier was calculated within the london approximation and the typical penetration time was estimated by using fokker - planck equation .",
    "the resulting formula is of arrhenius type with the height of the surface barrier entering through the exponent . after substituting parameters typical for conventional low-@xmath0 materials ,",
    "this height was estimated to be as large as @xmath6-@xmath7 in terms of @xmath8 , from which it was concluded that thermally activated vortex penetration is practically unobservable .",
    "however , two decades later , after the discovery of high-@xmath0 materials , thermal activation over the surface barrier has attracted great attention .",
    "it was shown@xcite by kopylov _",
    "_ that thermal surmounting of the barrier becomes possible in layered high-@xmath0 superconductors , where the mixed state structure is represented by quasi-2d pancake vortices .",
    "burlachkov@xcite has analyzed the same phenomenon for high-@xmath0 superconductors of ybacuo type with 3d vortex lines .",
    "he has demonstrated that the height of the surface barrier in these compounds is dramatically suppressed , compared to low-@xmath0 materials , to @xmath9 , which leads to experimentally observable rates for thermally activated vortex penetration and expulsion . indeed ,",
    "these conclusions agree with numerous experiments , see e.g. ref @xcite , as well as the theoretical paper @xcite .",
    "thus , it is generally believed that thermally activated flux penetration and expulsion in low-@xmath0 superconductors is not possible , while for the case of high-@xmath0 superconductors it is quite standard . however , in the very recent experiment@xcite by cren _",
    "et al . _ no hysteresis for vortex entry and exit was found in a superconducting nano - island of pb having an extremely small thickness ( @xmath10 nm ) .",
    "lateral dimension of this sample was so small ( @xmath11 nm ) that it could accommodate only one vortex before turning to the normal state .",
    "this regime was referred in ref . @xcite as ultimate vortex confinement .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to show that thermal fluctuations can be responsible for the effective suppression of the surface barrier observed in the experiment of cren@xcite _ et al._. this can not be firmly proved by using previously developed approaches to the thermal activation over the surface barrier , since all these schemes are based on the london theory , while this theory is not applicable for small - sized samples with lateral dimensions of the order of the vortex core size .",
    "moreover , under these conditions , vortex position is not an appropriate variable , because an initial stage of vortex nucleation is associated with a `` nascent '' vortex , considered for the first time by kramer@xcite .",
    "`` nascent '' vortex represents an area at the sample s edge , where the order parameter is suppressed , but it does not vanish yet .",
    "as we show , the height of the potential barrier , under the experimental conditions of ref .",
    "@xcite , is mostly due to the vortex core nucleation rather than because of the motion of already formed vortex towards the island center .",
    "thus , the origin of the surface barrier in the limit of a very small sample size is not identical to the one for the traditional bean - livingston barrier .",
    "this feature has already been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present paper , in order to circumvent these difficulties , we use the following alternative scheme .",
    "( i ) we first solve ginzburg - landau equations approximately by using lowest landau level approximation for the order parameter and determine the surface barrier in terms of the populations of corresponding levels .",
    "the island we consider is so small that it can accommodate only one vortex .",
    "hence , to describe a barrier with a reasonable accuracy , it is sufficient to take into account only two levels ( with winding numbers 0 and 1 ) , which correspond to the vortex - free and one - vortex states .",
    "populations of these levels are then used as `` good '' variables instead of the vortex position .",
    "notice that there are no essential difficulties in extending the number of variables by taking into account more levels , which can be necessary when considering larger structures .",
    "( ii ) we then estimate `` viscosity '' coefficients associated with the motion of order parameter projected on the two landau levels .",
    "demagnetization effects are included into the consideration .",
    "( iii ) at the final step , we solve the backward fokker - planck equation , again in terms of the landau levels populations .",
    "our main result is an analytical expression for the typical time for thermally activated vortex entry ( exit ) .",
    "notice that the lowest landau level representation for the order parameter in mesoscopic superconductors was proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite and then used very widely .",
    "our calculations show that the height of the surface barrier , under the conditions of the experiment considered , is approximately  @xmath12 that is more typical for high-@xmath0 materials than for conventional low-@xmath0 superconductors .",
    "the major reasons for the potential barrier to be not so high are ( i ) very small island thickness , ( ii ) very small island lateral dimensions which result in the substantial suppression of the order parameter , ( iii ) relatively high sample s temperature@xcite ( @xmath13 k ) .",
    "the preexponential `` attempt time '' is quite small  - mainly because of the small system sizes , which result in a weak magnetic response of the island .",
    "this time was estimated to be of the order of 10@xmath1410@xmath15 s which is much smaller than the similar quantity@xcite for high-@xmath0 layered superconductors with pancake vortices ( @xmath16 s ) .",
    "the resulting first passage time @xmath17 both for the vortex entry and exit is also quite small , @xmath1810@xmath1910@xmath20 s.    thus , the results we here present demonstrate that the thermally - assisted suppression of the surface barrier can occur in nanosized samples made of _ _ low-__@xmath0 _  superconductors _ , which are already available for experimental investigations .    since nanosized superconductors might be perspective for technological application ( see e. g. ref @xcite ) and are even already used ( for instance , for single - photon detection purposes@xcite ) , the control of fluctuations in such structures is quite important .    this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we study surface barrier within the ginzburg - landau theory . in section iii we estimate viscosity coefficients , with taking into account demagnetization effects . in section iv , we solve the backward fokker - planck equation and determine first passage times both for the vortex penetration and expulsion .",
    "we conclude in section v.",
    "in this section , we determine approximately the height of the potential barrier for vortex exit and entry under the conditions of experimentcren .",
    "our results are applicable as long as the sample s radius remains comparable to the coherence length @xmath21 .",
    "the superconducting island studied in ref .",
    "@xcite had a `` smoothed '' hexagonal shape with a small thinner region in its center , as seen from fig .",
    "1(b ) of ref . @xcite .",
    "the smallest lateral size of the sample was 110 nm , while the thickness was @xmath22 nm .",
    "sample temperature was @xmath23 k. the transition between the vortex - free and one - vortex states , as obtained by sts measurements , occurred at the applied field of @xmath24 t. the transition was reversible within 3 % .",
    "the reversibility implies that at this field energies of vortex - free and one - vortex phases become equal .",
    "there was a disordered layer between the island and the si substrate , which limitates@xcite the quasiparticle mean free part to @xmath25 .",
    "the zero - temperature coherence length was estimated@xcite by using an expression for dirty superconductors @xmath26 , where @xmath27  nm is the coherence length in bulk pb .",
    "this yields @xmath28 nm . the coherence length @xmath29 should be larger , but it is not easy to find its precise value theoretically because of the small system sizes ( and nontrivial shape ) , which makes the microscopic physics quite complex@xcite .",
    "however , it was possible to extract the coherence length directly from the measured zero - bias conductance profile in the vortex core , which yielded the value of @xmath30 nm @xcite . in this paper , we assume a value of @xmath31 nm . for the penetration depth , we use the usual expression@xcite for dirty superconductors , @xmath32 where @xmath33  nm is the penetration depth in bulk pb , @xmath34 k. this gives @xmath35 nm .",
    "notice that the use of the prefactor @xmath36 is , in fact , rather relative .",
    "the ginzburg - landau parameter , corresponding to the above numbers , is @xmath37 @xmath38 .",
    "when considering the diamagnetic response of the island , one has to keep in mind that effective @xmath4 is much higher@xcite , since @xmath39 .",
    "although the island has a rounded hexagonal shape , it is actually quite similar to a disc ( see fig .",
    "1(b ) of ref .",
    "therefore , we model it by the disc . as for its diameter",
    ", we use the value of 150 nm , which corresponds approximately to the largest ( `` bottom '' ) lateral dimension of the island .",
    "this value together with @xmath31 nm for the coherence length will allow us to reproduce the experimentally found field for the transition between the vortex - free and single - vortex states ( @xmath24 t ) .",
    "note that the radius of the disc in terms of the coherence length is approximately 1.55 .",
    "this regime indeed corresponds to the `` ultimate vortex confinement '' : the disc is able to accommodate only one vortex before the transition to the normal state , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us make some basic estimates .",
    "we compare the thermal energy @xmath8 with the energy required to create a vortex nucleus , i.e. , to suppress the order parameter to zero within the volume @xmath40 .",
    "the similar idea is applied when calculating the ginzburg - levanyuk number@xcite . within the ginzburg - landau theory ,",
    "the energy gain due to the vortex nucleus is @xmath41where @xmath42 is the thermodynamical critical field , given by@xmath43for the experiment performed at @xmath44 we obtain the following estimate for the ratio : @xmath45which is basically not so small .",
    "notice that the order parameter is strongly suppressed in the vicinity of the transition between vortex - free and one - vortex states .",
    "this should reduce condensation energy and enhance the ratio ( 3 ) in several times .",
    "also , we expect that the barrier height to be much lower than the above estimate due to an additional reason : vortex nucleation is associated mainly with the _ redistribution _ of the density of superconducting electrons inside the island rather than with the change of their total number .",
    "thus , the ratio of @xmath8 and the barrier height has to be of the same order as in high-@xmath0 superconductorsburlachkov , where rates for thermally activated flux penetration and expulsion are observable .",
    "below we show that this is indeed the case .",
    "we start with the dimensionless ginzburg - landau functional for the energy of the disc in the superconducting phase compared to the normal state :    @xmath46    where integration is performed over the disc cross section ( cylindrical coordinate system is used ) , @xmath47 is the dimensionless radius of the disc , @xmath48 is the dimensionless order parameter , @xmath49 is the vector potential , which has only an azimuthal component , @xmath50 is the external magnetic field measured in terms of the upper critical field @xmath51 , and all the distances are measured in units of @xmath21 . due to small disc sizes ,",
    "the external magnetic field penetrates the sample almost totally , so that the magnetic field inside the disc is essentially equal to the external field .",
    "since the disc thickness @xmath52 is much smaller than @xmath29 , the order parameter does not vary in @xmath53 direction .",
    "hence , the problem both for the order parameter and barrier height is effectively two - dimensional .",
    "the order parameter can be represented as a furrier expansion @xmath54 in the vortex - free state , only one coefficient among @xmath55 s is nonzero , namely @xmath56 . in the one - vortex state ,",
    "a nonzero coefficient is @xmath57 .",
    "the disc we consider is so small ( in terms of @xmath58 ) that it can accommodate only one vortex .",
    "therefore , with good accuracy , we can map the order parameter on the subspace with only two nonzero components:@xmath59the superposition ( 6 ) actually describes vortex exit or entrance .",
    "if we start with the vortex - free state ( @xmath60 ) , an increase of @xmath57 first leads to the suppression of the order parameter at some spot on the disc edge .",
    "this suppression can be interpreted as a formation of a vortex nucleus or a `` nascent '' vortex @xcite . at certain value of @xmath57 ,",
    "the order parameter in the center of this nucleus gets suppressed to zero , and the phase of the order parameter now changes by @xmath61 when turning around this topological defect .",
    "thus , the real vortex is formed .",
    "further increasing of @xmath57 leads to the vortex displacement towards the disc center , with its position @xmath62 given simply by the condition : @xmath63 , which follows directly from eq .",
    "( 6 ) . if we now start with the one - vortex state ( @xmath64 ) , an increase of @xmath56 results in the vortex displacement towards the disc edge until it leaves the island .",
    "further simplifications come by using , for @xmath65 and @xmath66 , the eigen functions for the kinetic energy operator corresponding to winding numbers @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively , and to zero radial quantum number ( nodeless wave functions ) .",
    "the latter corresponds to the lowest eigen value for the kinetic energy operator , see e.g. ref .",
    "this choise for @xmath65 and @xmath69 can be justified by noting that at the transition to the normal state , the first ginzburg - landau equation can be linearized , i.e. , reduced to the eigen value equation for the kinetic energy operator ( with the eigen value 1 ) .",
    "therefore , in the vicinity of the transition , @xmath70 can be closely approximated by the the eigen functions for the same operator .",
    "this regime is indeed realized in the superconducting disc under conditions of `` ultimate vortex confinement '' , where the transition between the one - vortex and vortex - free states occurs at high fields , @xmath71 , so that the density of superconducting electrons is strongly suppressed . in cylindrical coordinates , eigen value equation",
    "reads@xmath72this equation can be solved analytically:@xmath73where @xmath74 is kummer function .",
    "( 7 ) has to be supplemented by the boundary condition at the superconductor / vacuum interface@xmath75values of @xmath76 for given @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 can be found numerically from eqs .",
    "( 8) and ( 9 ) .",
    "we now treat @xmath56 and @xmath57  as variational parameters and calculate disc energy , as given by eq .",
    "( 4 ) , as a function of these two parameters .",
    "thus the energy of the system is obtained as a biquadratic function of variational parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the resulting expression can be minimized with respect to @xmath56 and @xmath57 . without loss of generality ,",
    "@xmath56  and @xmath57  can be taken real and positive .",
    "although this method is not exact , we expect that it allows one to obtain rather accurate estimate of the potential barrier height for such a small island with the radius only slightly exceeding the vortex core size @xcite .",
    "the energy of the island , obtained from eqs .",
    "( 4)-(9 ) , is given by@xmath80where ( @xmath67 , @xmath81)@xmath82 in the range of parameters corresponding to the ultimate vortex confinement , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "let us stress that these numbers are internally dependent on the external field .",
    "the energy of the island in the vortex - free state @xmath86 can be found from eq .",
    "( 10 ) by minimization of @xmath87 with respect to @xmath56 , while keeping @xmath60 :    @xmath88    similarly , the energy of the single - vortex state is given by@xmath89    now , in order to find a height of the potential barrier for vortex entry , we start from the vortex - free solution , @xmath60 .",
    "we then begin to increase @xmath57 and we minimize @xmath87 with respect to @xmath56 at fixed @xmath57 . as a result ,",
    "the following `` optimal '' dependence of @xmath87 on @xmath57 is obtained    @xmath90 , \\text { \\ } c_{1}\\leq \\sqrt{-\\frac{\\alpha _ { 0}}{2\\gamma } , }   \\notag \\\\ f(0 & \\rightarrow & 1)=\\frac{h_{c}(t)^{2}}{\\mu _ { 0}}\\xi ( t)^{2}d\\left ( c_{1}^{2}\\alpha _ { 1}+c_{1}^{4}\\beta _ { 1}\\right ) , \\text { \\ } \\sqrt{-\\frac{\\alpha _ { 0}}{2\\gamma } } < c_{1}\\leq \\sqrt{-\\frac{\\alpha _ { 1}}{2\\beta _ { 1 } } } , \\label{16}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and similarly for the vortex exit , @xmath91 .",
    "the height of the potential barrier , which is determined by the saddle point in ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) space is given by the minimum of @xmath92 with respect to @xmath57 :    @xmath93    a systematic study shows that the vortex - free state is unstable with respect to the vortex penetration at @xmath94 t ; while the single - vortex state becomes unstable with respect to the vortex expulsion at @xmath95 t. thus , we see that the maximum hysteresis ( in absence of fluctuations ) is @xmath96 30 % .",
    "note that the width of the hysteresis region expands rapidly with increasing @xmath97 .",

    "the ratio of barrier height and @xmath8 is of the same order as for high-@xmath0 materials .",
    "the major reasons for a relatively low height of the potential barrier , as compared to the thermal energy , are ( i ) very small island thickness and ( ii ) very small disc radius which results in the substantial suppression of the order parameter in the relevant range of applied fields .",

    "2 we show the calculated surface barrier for the vortex entry , given by eqs .",
    "( 16 ) , as a function of @xmath57 .",
    "it is quite remarkable that almost the whole interval of @xmath57 from @xmath60 up to the saddle point corresponds to the vortex core nucleation rather than to the motion of a formed vortex inside the island .",
    "2 thus demonstrates that , under the experimental conditions of ref .",
    "@xcite , a vortex position can not be an appropriate variable to analyze thermal activation over the surface barrier , due to very small island s lateral dimensions .",
    "when vortices move , local magnetic field inside a superconductor changes in time . according to the faraday law ,",
    "this change produces a nonzero electric field which leads to an energy dissipation .",
    "the dissipation can be interpreted in terms of a viscous force acting on moving vortices .",
    "the microscopic theory of this phenomenon is rather complicated .",
    "however , reasonable estimates for the viscosity force can be obtained by using phenomenological approach within the ginzburg - landau theory tinkham , ufn , shmidt , al . in this paper , in order to estimate viscosity associated with the _ motion of the order parameter _ , we apply similar ideas .",
    "when finding the island energy , we did not take into account that the magnetic field varies inside the sample .",
    "this is fully justified since the disc is very thin ( @xmath101 ) and its radius is also small , @xmath102 , that allows one to use a perturbation theory@xcite in terms of a small parameter @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is much larger than @xmath4 due to demagnetization effects .",
    "physically , this implies that the additional field generated by the meissner current and by the vortex is small in comparison with the external uniform field .",
    "if we know the solution of the first ginzburg - landau equation @xmath48 for the order parameter in leading order , the vector potential @xmath105 of this additional field can be found as@xmath106where an integration is performed over the island volume and @xmath107 is a supercurrent density given by@xmath108 , \\label{19}\\]]where @xmath109 is the dimensionless vector potential in leading order which corresponds to the applied uniform field @xmath77 . instead of using the exact solution for @xmath48",

    "( 18 ) .",
    "the order parameter inside the island is already strongly suppressed in the vicinity of a transition to the one - vortex state .",
    "therefore , the conductivity is close to the conductivity of pb in the normal state @xmath113 .",
    "then , the dissipation rate in the sample @xmath114 can be estimated as @xmath115where the denominator in the left - hand side comes from the normalization condition .",
    "let us now consider the process of vortex entry within our representation for the order parameter , as given by eq .",

    "we stress that @xmath137 , by definition , is directly linked to the change of the population of the level with winding number 1 and not to the change of the vortex position .    from eq .",
    "we see that @xmath137 is proportional to @xmath140 and not to @xmath52 , as can be naively expected . such a strong dependence on @xmath52 is due to demagnetization effects that significantly diminish the diamagnetic response of the sample and , hence , the electric field .",
    "this response is further suppressed due to extremely small lateral dimensions of the island , because the supercurrent created by the vortex is localized within a confined area @xmath141 .",

    "2 ) . at the same time , the internal integral is essentially constant in this area .",
    "it is therefore can be approximated by replacing @xmath177 in the upper limit of integration by @xmath172 .",
    "the rhs of eq .",
    "( 39 ) is then rewritten through a product of two independent integrals@xmath179the very high accuracy of such a transformation can be easily verified numerically .",
    "it is directly linked to the fact that the barrier height is large compared to @xmath8 .",
    "the dominant contribution to the first integral in the rhs of eq .",
    "( 40 ) is provided by the neighborhood of @xmath150 , while for the second integral it is given by the neighborhood of @xmath173 .",
    "the latter is basically the reason why , in section iii , we have calculated the viscosity coefficient @xmath137 only in leading order in @xmath57 : taking into account higher - order terms does not lead to any significant changes .",

    ", @xmath186 is @xmath9610@xmath1410@xmath15s .",
    "this value together with our result for the surface barrier height , @xmath196 , gives @xmath19710@xmath20 s. the very small value for @xmath186 is due to the fact that the supercurrent is circulating within the tiny volume @xmath40 , so that the magnetic response of the island is quite weak .",
    "moreover , the order parameter is significantly suppressed . in addition , the distance from the island s edge to its center , which vortex has to pass , is very short .",
    "the above derivation was presented for the case of a vortex entry .",
    "the evaluation of the typical time for the vortex exit is quite similar .",
    "we have found that eq .",
    "( 46 ) remains applicable , which leads to similar order - of - magnitude estimates for @xmath17 .",
    "experimentally , it has also been observed that the magnetic field corresponding to the transition between one - vortex and vortex - free states was reversible within few percents@xcite .",
    "this can be understood by noting that , when changing the magnetic field away from 0.235 t , barriers for exit and entrance become asymmetrical .",
    "this means that the equilibrium probability distribution becomes extremely strongly peaked within the deeper well , as follows directly from fig .",
    "2 . indeed , it is easy to see that the difference in _ heights _ of the _ barriers _ gives the difference in _ energies _ between the _ bottoms _ of the two wells , because @xmath198 @xmath199 . since the absolute value of the difference in heights far exceeds @xmath8 already in the vicinity of 0.235 t ( as seen from fig .",
    "2 ) , the probability to find a system in a more shallow well is @xmath200 .",
    "thus , the system gets stabilized in the deeper well .    note that @xmath186 , as given by eq .",
    "( 46 ) , is not explicitly dependent on @xmath192 , in contrast to the similar quantity calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite within the london approximation . technically , this is due to the fact that the barrier profile , as given by eq .",
    "( 16 ) , is proportional to the _ second _ power of the relevant variable ( with which @xmath201 is associated ) , i.e. , to @xmath202 at @xmath203 , while the barrier profile in ref .",
    "@xcite is proportional to the _ first _ power of vortex displacement when this displacement is small . through the expansion ( 42 ) , this affects the second integral in the rhs of eq .",
    "( 40 ) and therefore leads to the mentioned difference .",
    "physically , it might be attributed to the fact that vortex penetration processes for the cases of a half - infinite superconductor and the island in the ultimate vortex confinement regime are qualitatively different . indeed , in the first case",
    "this process is associated with the motion of a `` rigid '' vortex line inside the superconductor , while in the second case it is represented by the formation of a `` soft '' vortex nucleus at the edge of the disc . in the first case ,",
    "the barrier is due to the pronounced magnetic interaction with the superconductor s surface . in the second case",
    ", it is due to the condensation energy increase and the residual magnetic interactions .",
    "we also wish to notice that the effect of thermal fluctuations of the order parameter on vortex penetration and expulsion in mesoscopic superconductors was previously studied@xcite by hernandes _",
    "_ by the numerical integration of the time - dependent ginzburg - landau equations . in these computations",
    "no thermal activation of vortices over the surface barrier was observed for parameters corresponding to samples made of low-@xmath0 superconductors , while this activation was shown to be possible for those samples , which are made of high-@xmath0 materials .",
    "this is consistent with previous experiments on al discs@xcite and micron - size structures made of high-@xmath0 material@xcite .",
    "we think that the difference between the results of the present paper and of ref .",
    "@xcite concerning low-@xmath0 samples can be attributed to the fact that in calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite the main parameters were chosen in such a way as to model experiments@xcite , where ( i ) discs of much larger thickness were studied compared to the island of ref .",
    "@xcite ( one order of magnitude and more ) , ( ii ) the order parameter was not significantly suppressed due to larger discs radii , ( iii ) sample temperature was lower in one order of magnitude or so compared to that of ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath0 of al is at least several times lower than @xmath0 of pb ) .    in the very recent experiment@xcite , strong _ current - induced",
    "_ fluctuation phenomena were observed in ultrathin ( @xmath204 nm ) superconducting nanowires fabricated in a form of a meander and made of nbn .",
    "lateral dimensions of sample s typical segment , in terms of @xmath21 , were one order of magnitude larger than that for the island in the ultimate vortex confinement regime .",
    "structures of this kind are used in single - photon detectors , while fluctuations are major source of dark - count events in such devices .",
    "fluctuation phenomena were explained by a thermally - activated vortex entry , as well as by the unbinding of vortex - antivortex pairs .",
    "the height of the surface barrier , as calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite , was at least one order of magnitude larger ( in terms of @xmath8 ) than the one for the superconducting island studied in the present paper .",
    "nevertheless , vortex penetration events were detectable .",
    "@xcite deals with the experimental investigation of superconducting islands of pb , which were quite similar to the islands studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and in the present paper .",
    "the thickness of those islands was even smaller than that of ref .",
    "however , measurements were performed at significantly lower temperature of 2.0 k. probably , this is why some hysteresis for vortex penetration and expulsion was observed .",
    "indeed , the activation time depends _ exponentially _ on the height of the potential barrier _ this height being much larger _ than @xmath8 .",
    "nevertheless , it was mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite that the width of the hysteresis region was noticably smaller than the theoretical values obtained from the ginzburg - landau theory .",
    "the results of the present paper evidence that thermal fluctuations might be responsible for an observed shrinkage of the hysteresis region .",
    "let us finally mention a very recent experiment@xcite on _ one - atomic layer _",
    "pb films , where magnetic vortices were directly visualized .",
    "thermal fluctuations must be strongest in such ultimately thin films",
    ".    since thermal fluctuations are more pronounced in low - dimensional systems , an understanding of vortex matter fluctuations in thin and small superconducting structures is of certain importance .",
    "it is howevere clear that more intensive experimental , as well as theoretical efforts are needed to reveal systematically those confinement and temperature regimes which favor thermal fluctuations in such nanostructures or , on the contrary , which enable one to safely avoid them .",
    "although it is generally believed that the surface barrier in _ low_-@xmath0 superconductors is too high to be suppressed by thermal fluctuations , in this paper we have shown that such a scenario is possible in small and ultrathin superconducting samples studied in modern experiments .",
    "in particular , we have demonstrated that an absence of hysteresis for vortex entry and exit in the nanosized island of pb observed in the very recent experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite ( and the shrinkage of hysteresis region reported in the similar experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite ) can be explained in terms of a thermal activation of a vortex over the surface barrier .",
    "lateral dimensions of these islands were so small that they could accommodate only one vortex before gradual transition to the normal state .",
    "for this reason , london approximation , which was previously applied to describe thermal surmounting of a surface barrier by vortices , is not applicable .",
    "we therefore have developed an alternative theoretical approach based on the lowest landau level approximation for the ginzburg - landau order parameter , which is suitable for such extremely small structures .",
    "the surface barrier profile was calculated in terms of populations of the two relevant landau levels being used throughout the paper as `` good '' variables instead of the `` bad '' one ( vortex position ) .",
    "the viscosity coefficient , associated with the motion of the projections of the order parameter , was estimated with account of demagnetization effects .",
    "finally , the expression for the typical time of thermally - assisted vortex entry ( exit ) was obtained from the fokker - planck equation , also written in terms of the populations of landau levels .",
    "this expression is of arrhenius type .",
    "we have found that the barrier height , under the conditions of experiment @xcite , is nearly 20 in terms of a thermal energy @xmath8 , which is close to the similar quantity for high-@xmath0 materials , where thermal suppression of a surface barrier is observable .",
    "although the exponent of this ratio is still very large , the preexponential `` attempt time '' is quite small , so that the typical time both for the vortex exit and entrance is several orders of magnitude smaller than 1 s.",
