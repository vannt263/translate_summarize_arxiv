    "in the yang - mills theory ghost field lagrangian does nt possess gauge symmetry and together with a gauge fixing term breaks gauge invariance of the effective action .",
    "it makes problems for regularization and renormalization of the theory .",
    "the slavnov - taylor identities are more complicated then the ward identities in electrodynamics . recently a new formulation of the yang - mills theory",
    "was proposed  @xcite in which the gauge invariance is broken only by the gauge fixing term . in the paper  @xcite it was shown that in the framework of perturbation theory this model is equivalent to the usual yang - mills theory . calculating the observables in this model one can pass to the lorentz - type gauge in which the renormalizability is evident .",
    "nevertheless a proof of renormalizability directly in the gauge proposed in the paper  @xcite is absent .    in the present paper we calculate at one - loop the gauge field and @xmath2-vertex renormalization constants .",
    "it is shown that a relationship between this constants is the same as in the ordinary yang - mills theory .",
    "let introduce notations .",
    "the lagrangian proposed in  @xcite looks as follows @xmath3 the fields  @xmath4 , @xmath5 are commuting complex @xmath6-doublets and @xmath7 , @xmath8 are anticommuting ones .",
    "@xmath10 is the covariant derivative ; @xmath11 are pauli matrices .",
    "the yang - mills lagrangian is @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "let introduce the fields @xmath14 , @xmath15 . in terms of these fields",
    "the gauge transformation leaving the lagrangian  ( [ l_origin ] ) invariant is @xmath16 being quantized in the lorentz gauge @xmath17 the model is described by the effective action which contains the gauge fixing term and non gauge invariant faddeev - popov ghost lagrangian .",
    "however in this model the lorentz invariant condition @xmath18 is also an admissible gauge . in this case",
    "the gauge invariance is broken by only the gauge fixing term : @xmath19 , here @xmath20 is the lagrangian  ( [ l_origin ] ) .",
    "the lagrangian  ( [ l_origin ] ) at the surface @xmath18 looks as follows @xmath21 the propagators and vertices are given in the appendix .",
    "we start with considering the gauge field renormalization constant  @xmath1 and @xmath2-vertex renormalization constant @xmath0 and show that in the one - loop approximation these constants coincide with the corresponding ones in the ordinary yang - mills theory .",
    "we also consider anticommuting fields renormalization constant  @xmath22 and @xmath23-vertex renormalization constant  @xmath24 and show that the relationship @xmath25 holds in one - loop approximation .",
    "the calculations can be found in the appendix .",
    "the dimensional regularization is used , hence all tadpole diagrams are equal to zero .",
    "the constant  @xmath1 renormalizes the transversal part of one - particle irreducible diagrams with two external gauge field lines  @xmath26 .",
    "there are three types of the contributions to the divergent part of the corresponding diagrams .",
    "the first one is a contribution of gauge field  @xmath26 loops .",
    "this contribution is the same as in the ordinary yang - mills theory , because the vertices @xmath2 , @xmath27 and the propagators coincide with the usual ones .",
    "the second one is the contribution of loops with commuting scalar fields  @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "and the third one is the contribution of loops with anticommuting fields  @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "the sum of the second and the third contributions equals to @xmath30 in the ordinary yang - mills theory divergent part of faddeev - popov ghosts loop is the following  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "@xmath31 one can see that transversal parts of  ( [ z2_sumcommanticomm ] ) and  ( [ z2_fpghosts ] ) coincide . as it was mentioned above the contributions of gauge field  @xmath26 loops in the present theory and in the yang - mills theory",
    "coincide and therefore constants  @xmath1 coincide too .    note that contrary to the standard formulation of the yang - mills theory the radiative corrections generate also renormalization of the longitudinal part of the polarization operator , that is the counterterm proportional to @xmath32 . such a counterterm does not break the gauge invariance , because it originates from the admissible gauge invariant counterterm @xmath33 after the shift @xmath34 .",
    "the constant  @xmath0 performs renormalization of @xmath2-vertex .",
    "again there are three types of contributions .",
    "contribution of the gauge field  @xmath26 loops coincide with the corresponding one in the ordinary yang - mills theory . in one - loop approximation",
    "the total contribution of commuting scalar fields @xmath28 , @xmath29 and anticommuting fields @xmath7 , @xmath8 is equal to @xmath35 it coincides with the contribution of faddeev - popov ghosts in the ordinary yang - mills theory and therefore the constant  @xmath0 equals yang - mills constant @xmath0 .",
    "thus in one - loop approximation the constants  @xmath1 , @xmath0 are the same as in the yang - mills theory and therefore the expression  @xmath36 is the same as in the yang - mills theory . @xmath37 which means that the model is asymptotically free .    to find the constants  @xmath22 , @xmath24 ,",
    "it is necessary to calculate the divergent part of the diagrams represented on fig .",
    "[ fig_z2bar ] ,  [ fig_z1bar ] . performing the calculations we obtain @xmath38 thus @xmath39 .",
    "in the present paper it was shown that the theory with the gauge invariant ghost lagrangian agrees with the standard yang - mills theory in one - loop approximation . the relationship @xmath40 between renormalization constants which is one of the necessary conditions of gauge invariance of renormalized lagrangian holds",
