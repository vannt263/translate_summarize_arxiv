    "the microgravity field has become nowadays one of the most promising new areas for the commercialization of space .",
    "the development of scientific and technological experiments carried out under conditions of reduced gravity has been proposed by the brazilian space agency by employing a recoverable orbital system .",
    "the orbital system , built in a platform with a capsule shape , is designed in order to stay in orbit during the time needed for the execution of the experiments .",
    "after that , the capsule is sent back to the earth and recovered .",
    "the aerothermodynamic aspects during the ballistic reentry flight , in the development of a capsule platform , offer exciting challenges to the aerodynamicists . in the earth atmosphere reentry ,",
    "the capsule undergoes not only different velocity regimes  hypersonic , supersonic and subsonic  but also different flow regimes  free molecular flow , transition and continuum  and flight conditions that may difficult their aerodynamic design .",
    "therefore , the capsule aerodynamic design , of great importance for the flight through several atmosphere layers , has to consider important aspects such as stability , drag and heating loads . in this context",
    ", a combination of engineering tools , experimental analysis , and numerical methods is used in the design of high altitude reentry capsule aerodynamics .",
    "nevertheless , due to difficulties and high costs associated to the experimental work at high speed flows , a numerical analysis becomes imperative .",
    "many experimental and numerical studies  @xcite have been dedicated to the aerothermodynamic of vehicles reentering the earth atmosphere .",
    "nevertheless , for the particular case of sara capsule , only a few studies are available in the current literature  @xcite . for the purpose of this introduction",
    ", it will be sufficient to describe only some of these studies .",
    "sharipov  @xcite has investigated the flowfield structure over the sara capsule by employing the dsmc method .",
    "it was assumed the monatomic gas argon as the working fluid and freestream mach numbers of 5 , 10 , and 20 . even considering that the real gas effect in a reentry capsule is not well represented by a monotonic gas , that investigation",
    "might be considered as the first contribution to the aerothermodynamic analysis of the sara capsule in high altitudes .",
    "pimentel et al .",
    "@xcite have performed inviscid hypersonic flow simulations over the sara capsule modeled by employing the planar two - dimensional ( 2-d ) and the axisymmetric euler equations .",
    "results were presented for an altitude of 80 km , mach numbers of 15 and 18 , and angle of attack of 0 and 10 degrees .",
    "they also considered air as working fluid composed of five species ( n@xmath0 , o@xmath0 , o , n , and no ) with their reactions of dissociation and recombination . pressure and",
    "temperature contour maps were presented for 2-d and axisymmetric flow .",
    "finally , by using axisymmetric navier - stokes equations , tchuen et al .",
    "@xcite have investigated the flowfield structure over the sara capsule by considering hypersonic flow at zero angle of attack in chemical and thermal non - equilibrium .",
    "it was assumed air as working fluid composed of seven species ( n@xmath0 , o@xmath0 , o , n , no , no@xmath1 , and @xmath2 ) associated with their reactions of dissociation and recombination .",
    "results for pressure , skin friction , and heat transfer coefficients were presented for different combinations of mach numbers of 10 , 20 and 25 with altitudes of 75 and 80 km .",
    "the interest in the majority of these sara studies has basically gone into considering the flow in the continuum flow regime .",
    "conversely , in the transition flow regime , there is a little understanding of the physical aspects of a hypersonic flow past to the sara capsule related to the severe aerothermodynamic environment in the reentry trajectory . in this fashion",
    ", the purpose of the present account is to investigate the flowfield structure of a hypersonic flow over the sara capsule in the transition flow regime , i.e. , between the free collision flow and the continuum flow regime .",
    "the primary goal is to assess the sensitivity of the primitive properties , such as , velocity , density , pressure , and temperature due to changes on the altitude representative of a typically reentry trajectory of the sara capsule .",
    "therefore , the present study focuses on the low - density region in the upper atmosphere , where the non - equilibrium conditions are such that the traditional computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) calculations are inappropriate to yield accurate results .",
    "in such a circumstance , the direct simulation monte carlo ( dsmc ) method will be employed to calculate the planar two - dimensional and the axisymmetric hypersonic flow over the sara capsule .",
    "it is important to mention that , for the particular case of sara , this is the first work to present the flowfield structure in the transition flow regime by considering two species ( n@xmath0 and o@xmath0 ) as working fluid , and rotation and vibration internal modes of energy .",
    "the sara reentry capsule is an axisymmetric design consisting of a spherical nose with a 11.4-degree half - angle conical afterbody .",
    "the nose radius @xmath3 is 0.2678 m , the afterbody base has a radius @xmath4 of 0.5035 m , and the total length @xmath5 is 1.410 m. figure  [ bjopp02f01 ] illustrates schematically the capsule shape and the main important physical and geometric parameters related to the hypersonic flow on the capsule .",
    "the main physical parameters are defined as follows : @xmath6 is the freestream mach number , @xmath7 stands for the knudsen number , @xmath8 is the angle of attack , @xmath9 is the wall temperature , and finally , @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent the parameters related to the gas - surface interaction . in this fashion , the flowfield structure around the capsule may be affected by the effects of compressibility , rarefaction , gas - surface interaction , etc .",
    "flow conditions represent those experienced by the capsule in the reentry trajectory from 100 to 80 km of altitude .",
    "this range of altitude is associated with the transition flow regime , which is characterized by the overall knudsen number the order of or larger than @xmath12 .",
    "freestream flow conditions used for the numerical simulation of flow past the capsule are those given by hirschel  @xcite and summarized in tables  [ tab1 ] and  [ tab2 ] , and the gas properties  @xcite are shown in table  [ tab3 ] . referring to this set of tables , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 stand respectively for temperature , pressure , density , number density , molecular mean free path , and velocity , and @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 account respectively for mass fraction , molecular mass , molecular diameter and viscosity index .",
    ".freestream flow conditions  @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab4 ]    according to figs .",
    "[ bjopp02f14](a - b ) , it is clearly seen that the wall pressure ratio for the present work agreed reasonably well with that obtained experimentally .",
    "it is important to remark that the shape of the pressure distributions as described in nondimensional coordinates is independent of the spherical nose radius and of the reynolds number over the range investigated .",
    "computations of a rarefied hypersonic flow over the sara capsule have been performed by using the direct simulation monte carlo method .",
    "the calculations provided information concerning the nature of the flowfield structure about the primary properties at the vicinity of the nose and immediately adjacent to the afterbody surface by considering planar two - dimensional and axisymmetric geometries .",
    "effects of rarefaction on the velocity , density , pressure , and temperature for a representative range of parameters were investigated .",
    "the altitude varied from 100 to 80 km , which corresponded to knudsen numbers @xmath23 from 0.4615 to 0.0115 , reynolds number @xmath24 from 92 to 15249 , and mach number @xmath6 from 27 to 29 .",
    "therefore , cases considered in this study covered the hypersonic flow in the transitional flow regime .",
    "it was found that changes on the altitude as well as on the capsule geometry disturbed the flowfield around the capsule , as expected .",
    "the domain of influence decreased by decreasing the altitude . in addition , the domain of influence for the axisymmetric case was smaller than that for 2-d case . moreover , the extent of the flowfield disturbance along the stagnation streamline due to changes on the altitude was significantly different for each one of the primary flow properties .",
    "the analysis showed that the domain of influence for temperature is larger than that observed for pressure , density and velocity .",
    "the present document has described an initial investigation of a high - altitude and low - density flow over the sara capsule .",
    "although this investigation has taken into account a representative range of altitudes , improvements are still desirable to a realistic capsule design .",
    "since no database exist for such a design and since no appropriate flight data are available at such high entry velocities and conditions , the use of computational methods is essential .",
    "since many of these issues occur in the rarefied portion of the trajectory , accurate dsmc analysis are especially important .",

    "this section focuses on the analysis of the influence of the cell size , the time step , and the number of molecules per computational cell on the surface properties in order to achieve grid independent solutions .",
    "heat transfer , pressure and skin friction coefficients were selected in order to elucidate the requirements posed for the grid sensitivity study . as an illustrative example ,",
    "the analysis presented in this section is limited to the capsule at an altitude of 90 km .",
    "the same procedure was employed for the other cases .",
    "a grid independence study was made with three different structured meshes in each coordinate direction .",
    "the effect of altering the cell size in the @xmath25-direction was investigated with grids of 75 ( coarse ) , 150 ( standard ) and 225 ( fine ) cells , and 60 cells in the @xmath26-direction .",

    "[ bjopp02f16](a - c ) .",

    "therefore , the standard grid , 120  @xmath33  110 cells , for the 90 km case , is essentially an independent grid .",
    "one of the fundamental requirements in the dsmc method is that the time step @xmath34 must be smaller than the local mean collision time .",
    "this requirement is related to the important assumption employed in the dsmc method , i.e. , the molecular movement can be decoupled from the intermolecular interactions in a dilute gas if a sufficient small time step is used .",
    "in addition , in order to maintain a uniform distribution of simulated particles in the entire computational domain , a different time step @xmath34 and scaling factor @xmath35 can be obtained for each cell .",
    "@xmath35 is the number of real particles represented by one single simulated particle . as a result ,",
    "the dsmc efficiency increases , and the computational effort is balanced within the simulated domain .",
    "it is worthwhile to highlight that although the time step @xmath34 and scaling factor @xmath35 vary among the cells , the ratio @xmath36 must be the same in the entire domain .",
    "this requirement assures that the `` mass flux '' across the cell boundaries is conserved .    with this perspective in mind , the following procedure is followed : ( 1 ) a computational grid is generated based on freestream conditions ; ( 2 ) @xmath34 and @xmath35 values are defined for each cell according to the dsmc requirements and subject to the condition that @xmath36 has the same value in every cell ; ( 3 ) the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 are iteratively modified as the flow evolves within the simulated domain until each cell contains , on average , the desired number of simulated particles ; ( 4 ) for the entire flowfield , all dsmc requirements are verified , i.e. , cell size smaller than the local mean free path , the time step smaller than the time related to the local collision frequency and a number of molecules around 20 - 30 molecules .",
    "if within any cell these conditions are not satisfied the grid adaptation procedure , steps ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , is restarted for a more appropriate spatial discretization .    in doing so , @xmath34 and @xmath35 will be different for coarse , standard , and fine grids . by considering the standard grid for the 90 km case , a total of 13200 cells , the time step @xmath34 changed from 4.5979@xmath37 to 1.3953@xmath38 , and",
    "the scaling factor @xmath35 changed from 5.0601@xmath39 to 1.5355@xmath40 .    in a second stage of the grid independence investigation ,",
    "a similar examination was made for the number of molecules .",
    "the standard grid for the 90 km case , 120  @xmath33  110 cells , corresponds to , on average , a total of 189,100 molecules .",
    "two new cases using the same grid were investigated .",
    "these two new cases correspond to 94,500 and 283,700 molecules in the entire computational domain .",

    "results for velocity , translational temperature , and rotational temperature distributions along the stagnation streamline were presented and compared with those obtained from another established dsmc code  @xcite based in a code - to - code comparison .",
    "since this comparison was published elsewhere  @xcite , details will be kept to a minimum and the discussion restricted to the significant conclusions .    in the computational solution , it was assumed that the flat - ended circular cylinder is immersed in a uniform stream flowing parallel to the cylinder itself .",
