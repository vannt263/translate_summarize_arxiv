    "despite the wealth of communication and interaction means made available by our modern societies , direct face - to - face interactions between individuals remain an essential element of human behavior and of human societies .",
    "they contribute to shape human social networks and determine channels of information propagation , of opinion formation , as well as the potential transmission routes of infectious diseases , in particular of respiratory pathogens .",
    "accurate descriptions of the corresponding contact patterns represent therefore important tools in several respects : for the fundamental knowledge and understanding of human behavior and social networks , as well as to inform models of epidemic spread and to design and evaluate control measures such as the targeting of specific groups of individuals with appropriate prevention strategies or interventions .",
    "empirical data describing direct interactions between individuals are however by nature difficult to gather .",
    "various techniques have been developed to this aim , and many data sets collected and exploited , in particular in the epidemiological context ( see @xcite for a review ) : surveys and diaries  @xcite , synthetic population models  @xcite and , thanks to the increase in the availability and use of novel technologies , infrastructures based on various types of wearable sensors @xcite .",
    "methods based on surveys or diaries on the one hand , and sensing platforms based on wearable sensors on the other hand , have each advantages and limitations .",
    "well - studied questionnaires allow to gather informations not only on the existence of contacts but also on additional characteristics , such as their context ( home , work , travel ) , an estimate of their durations , the existence of repeated contacts with the same individual , or even the distance from home at which the contacts take place  @xcite .",
    "questionnaires can also ask to specify for each contact if it involved physical contact and distinguish periods of well - being and illness of the respondent  @xcite .",
    "surveys however are costly and it is difficult to recruit participants  @xcite .",
    "moreover , self - reporting procedures entail biases that are difficult to estimate  @xcite , as participants might not recall all their contacts or might make incorrect estimates of their durations .",
    "for instance , according to @xcite , factors such as ambiguity , emotions , and rapid responding together with the retrospective collection of survey data can induce an _ extreme responding _ bias in scale - rating diaries .",
    "furthermore , time perception can be inaccurate in retrospective analysis , as in general people s recollections decay rapidly with time @xcite ; in this respect , having a precise schedule of day activity can help to assign durations to meetings @xcite .",
    "wearable sensors on the other hand can be tuned to specifically detect close - range face - to - face proximity  @xcite .",
    "they afford an objective definition of contact , can detect even short encounters , and the decrease in the related costs makes nowadays large - scale deployments feasible .",
    "they also give access to temporally resolved data sets , i.e. , make possible a longitudinal study of human contacts .",
    "the main limitation of automated sensing platforms based on sensors comes from the fact that they do not register contacts with individuals not participating to the data collection ( not wearing any sensor ) and therefore provide data on the contacts among a closed population .",
    "sampling issues can also arise if not all the members of the population of interest agree to wear the sensors  @xcite .",
    "given these respective advantages and limitations of different methods , comparing data collected by both types of methods in a given population is of great interest .",
    "to our knowledge , only one such study has been performed to date , as it is rarely possible to collect data using both methods .",
    "smieszek et al .",
    "@xcite report on such a study in a high school context , showing for instance that many contacts registered by sensors are not reported in surveys , especially short ones , while long contacts are better reported .",
    "another issue of interest consists in the comparison between contact networks , corresponding to the actual behavior of individuals , and friendship relations or online social links .",
    "many social studies are indeed performed through surveys of self - reported friendships , starting with @xcite , and the study of online social networks has led to the whole field of computational social science @xcite .",
    "the question of how these various networks ( contacts , reported friendship , online social links ) overlap or complement each other is quite largely open @xcite .",
    "for instance , social phenomena such as homophily @xcite are typically studied through questionnaires , but recent studies have shown that behavioral contact networks can also provide interesting insights in this issue @xcite . combining data from different sources to obtain a more complete picture of the contacts and interactions in a population could therefore represent an interesting route to study various questions of relevance in social sciences or epidemiology .    here",
    "we present and analyze data sets corresponding to these various types of interactions and collected through concurrent data collection methods among more than @xmath0 high school students during one week in december 2013 .",
    "data regarding face - to - face contacts were measured using both the sociopatterns sensing platform @xcite based on wearable sensors and contact diaries in which the students were asked to report the contacts they had .",
    "surveys in which students were asked to nominate their friends were also used , and students were finally asked to provide the network of their contacts on facebook .",
    "all data sets obtained using survey - like methods suffer from important sampling issues , highlighting the interest of sensor - based methods in this respect .",
    "we compare the contact patterns measured by sensors and reported by the students , in a spirit similar to the work of  @xcite .",
    "we confirm the main findings of these previous studies , for instance that longer contacts have major reporting probabilities , and provide some additional insights : we find in particular that , despite the important discrepancies between the data obtained by both methods , the mixing patterns between classes are well identified even through contact diaries .",
    "we moreover compare the network of reported friendships and the facebook links with the contact patterns , finding that the longest contact durations correspond to reported friendships but that reported friendship links can also correspond to short contacts .",
    "we finally perform a preliminary multiplex analysis of the various possible links between individuals : contacts , reported friendships and facebook links .",
    "we find that reported friendships and facebook links are not at all equivalent with respect to the durations of actual face - to - face contacts .",
    "the data collection concerned high school students of specific classes called `` classes prparatoires '' in lyce thiers , marseilles , france . these classes , specific to the french schooling system , gather students for studies that take place for two years after the end of the usual high school studies .",
    "the students study in a high school environment but are de facto mostly separated from the `` regular '' high school students : their classes are located in a different part of the high school building and they typically take their lunches separately . at the end of these two years , students go through competitive exams yielding admission to various higher education colleges .",
    "the classes have different specialization : `` mp '' classes focus more on mathematics and physics , `` pc '' classes on physics and chemistry , `` psi '' classes on engineering studies and `` bio '' classes on biology .",
    "we collected data among students of nine classes corresponding to the second year of such studies : 3 classes of type `` mp '' ( mp , mp*1 , mp*2 ) , two of type `` pc '' ( pc and pc * ) , one of type `` psi '' ( psi * ) and 3 of type `` bio '' ( 2bio1 , 2bio2 , 2bio3 ) .",
    "all these students must prepare a small scientific project that they present at the final exam , and several students could build a project based on their participation to the data collection , together with the use of the collected data in some small scale analysis or numerical simulations .",
    "the active involvment of some students ensured a good participation of other students to the data collection , as also reported in other works @xcite .",
    "we collected data of different nature .    *",
    "we deployed the contact measurement platform developed by the sociopatterns collaboration @xcite , which is based on sensors that are embedded in unobtrusive wearable badges and exchange ultra - low power radio packets in order to detect close proximity of individuals wearing them .",
    "as described in detail in @xcite , the power is tuned so that the sensors can exchange packets only when within @xmath1 meters of one another .",
    "moreover , students were asked to wear the sensors on their chests using lanyards , ensuring that the devices of two individuals can only exchange radio packets when the persons are facing each other .",
    "the sensors are also tuned so that the face - to - face proximity of two individuals wearing them can be assessed over an interval of @xmath2 seconds with a probability in excess of @xmath3 .",
    "contact data are thus collected with a temporal resolution of @xmath2 seconds : two individuals are considered to be in contact during a @xmath4 time window if their sensors exchanged at least one packet during that interval , and the contact event is considered over when the sensors do not exchange packets over a @xmath4 interval .",
    "the information on face - to - face proximity events detected by the wearable sensors is relayed to radio receivers installed throughout the high school : contacts occurring outside the school premises were not measured .",
    "thanks to this infrastructure , we gathered contact data of the @xmath5 participating students ( out of @xmath6 in the @xmath7 classes , i.e. , a @xmath8 participation rate ) during the week of dec . 2 - 6 , 2013 . * at the end of one specific day , namely dec . 5 , 2013",
    ", we asked students to fill in paper contact diaries : they were asked to give the list of other students they had had contact with ( where contact was defined as close face - to - face proximity ) during the day in the high school , and to give the approximate aggregated duration of the contacts with each nominated individual , to choose in one of four possible categories : at most 5 minutes , between 5 and 15 minutes , between 15 minutes and 1 hour , more than one hour .",
    "@xmath9 students returned a filled in diary .",
    "* during the period of the deployment , we moreover asked the students to fill in a survey in which they were asked to give the names of their friends in the high school .",
    "we obtained such friendship surveys from @xmath10 students .",
    "* we asked students to use the netvizz application ( ` https://apps.facebook.com/netvizz/ ` ) to create their local network of facebook friendships ( i.e. , the use of the application by a student yields the network of facebook friendship relations between this student s facebook friends ) .",
    "@xmath11 students gave us access to their local network , from which we removed all users who were not concerned by the data collection .",
    "* each participating student gave us moreover access to the following metadata : gender , class , class in the previous year , whether s / he was smoker , and if s / he was repeating the year .",
    "we finally note that the present data collection was the third of this kind in this high school .",
    "the data coming from the previous two data collections ( performed in dec .",
    "2011 and nov .",
    "2012 ) were analyzed in @xcite .",
    "they concerned only the contacts recorded by the sociopatterns infrastructure ( for three classes in 2011 and five classes in 2012 ) , but no contact diaries nor friendship surveys .      before the study",
    ", students and teachers were informed on the details and aims of the study .",
    "a signed informed consent was obtained for each participant ( no minors were involved as all students were at least @xmath12 at the time of the deployment ) .",
    "they received a wearable sensor to wear during the school time .",
    "no personal information , besides the ones indicated in the previous section , were collected .",
    "the _ commission nationale de linformatique et des liberts _ ( cnil , http://www.cnil.fr ) , representing the french national bodies responsible for ethics and privacy , and the high school authorities approved the study .",
    "the collected data sets have different nature and different resolutions .",
    "the most detailed data comes from the sociopatterns infrastructure and consists in a temporal network of contacts between students , with a temporal resolution of @xmath2 seconds : the nodes of this network represent students , and for each time window of @xmath2 seconds a link is drawn between pairs of students between whom contacts are detected .",
    "this temporal network can be aggregated temporally over a given duration , for instance a day or the whole duration of the data collection : weighted daily or global aggregated networks are then obtained . in each aggregated network",
    ", a node represents an individual and a weighted link between two nodes @xmath13 and @xmath14 represents the fact that the two corresponding individuals have been in contact at least once during the aggregation time window .",
    "the weight @xmath15 of a link between @xmath13 and @xmath14 is given by the total time spent in contact by @xmath13 and @xmath14 during the aggregation window .",
    "the data can be further aggregated by grouping together students of the same class : the resulting mixing patterns between classes are described by the so - called `` contact matrices '' .",
    "we define contact matrices of different types :    * in the contact matrix of link densities , the element @xmath16 is given by the density of links between classes @xmath17 and @xmath18 , i.e. , the number of links @xmath19 between individuals of class @xmath17 and individuals of class @xmath18 normalized by the maximum possible number of such links ( @xmath20 if @xmath21 , @xmath22 if @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the number of students in class @xmath17 ) . * in the contact matrix of contact durations , the element @xmath16 is defined as @xmath25 ( and @xmath26 ) : it gives the total time spent in contact between students of class @xmath17 and students of class @xmath18 .",
    "these elements can also be normalized , e.g. , @xmath27 gives the average time spent by a student of class @xmath17 with students of class @xmath18 .",
    "as for the aggregated networks , these matrices can be defined on any temporal aggregation time - window .",
    "the contact diaries , on the other hand , do not provide temporally resolved data . as each participating student reports contacts with other students , giving a certain aggregated duration for each , the resulting data set is a weighted directed network : in this network , each node is a student and a link is drawn from @xmath13 to @xmath14 with weight @xmath28 if student @xmath13 reported contacts of total duration @xmath28 with student @xmath14 .",
    "note that links are not necessarily reciprocated , i.e. , student @xmath14 might not report a contact with @xmath13 even if @xmath13 reported such a contact and , even when they are reciprocated , the reported durations might not coincide , i.e. , @xmath28 is not necessarily equal to @xmath29 .",
    "we will first perform a systematic study of these discrepancies . then , in order to compare the contact diary data with the sensor data as in @xcite , we will consider a symmetrized version of the network , in which a link exists between @xmath13 and @xmath14 if at least one of the two students reported a contact , and the weight of the link is taken as the maximum of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "from such symmetrized network , we can also aggregate the data by class and obtain contact matrices .    the friendship survey yields , as the contact diaries , a directed network between students : indeed , a student @xmath13 might nominate @xmath14 as a friend without being nominated by @xmath14 . as we did not ask students to quantify the intensity of their friendships , we obtain a directed unweighted network of reported friendship relations .",
    "we can also symmetrize the network in order to compare it with the aggregated contact network , and obtain a link density contact matrix between classes .",
    "finally , the data set gathered from the local facebook friendship networks has a slightly more complex character .",
    "indeed , for each individual who gave us access to his / her local network , we obtain the facebook friendship links between his / her facebook friends .",
    "however , as only few students provided us with such data , the presence or absence of a facebook friendship link between many pairs of students remained unknown .",
    "to understand this point , let us take the example of two students @xmath30 and @xmath31 , with sets of facebook friends @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "let us now take two students @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the union @xmath34 .",
    "if both @xmath13 and @xmath14 are in @xmath32 , or both are in @xmath33 , we know if they are facebook friends or not . if however @xmath35 and @xmath36 , i.e. , @xmath13 is friend with @xmath30 but not with @xmath31 and @xmath14 is friend with @xmath31 but not with @xmath30 , we do not have access to the existence or absence of a friendship link between @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( see fig . [ fbprob ] ) . as a result",
    ", the data set can not be represented as a network but consists in a list of pairs of students for which we know if they are facebook friends or not ( list of `` known - pairs '' ) and a list of pairs for which the presence or absence of such a link is unknown .",
    "during the data collection , @xmath37 contact events were registered between the @xmath5 students carrying wearable sensors , with a cumulative duration of @xmath38s ( @xmath39 1047 hours ) .",
    "as the statistical characteristics of these contacts are very similar to the ones obtained in the previous data collections in the same setting @xcite , we only provide here a summary of these results and refer the interested reader to the supporting information ( si ) for details .",
    "as commonly observed in such data @xcite , the duration of contacts was highly variable : the average duration of a contact was @xmath40 seconds , with however @xmath41 of the contacts having duration smaller than @xmath42 minute and on the other hand @xmath43 lasting more than @xmath44 minutes .",
    "the distribution of these durations , shown in the si , is very broad , spanning several orders of magnitude , with a coefficient of variation ( cv ) equal to @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , the time intervals between successive contacts are also broadly distributed , spanning several orders of magnitude : most intercontact durations are short , but very long durations are also observed , and no characteristic timescale emerges  @xcite .",
    "this bursty behavior is a well known feature of human dynamics and has been observed in a variety of systems driven by human actions  @xcite .",
    "the contact network aggregated over the whole data collection has @xmath5 nodes and @xmath46 weighted edges . as expected in such networks ,",
    "the average shortest path length ( spl ) is small ( @xmath47 ) and the clustering coefficient is large ( @xmath48 , against @xmath49 in a random network with the same number of nodes and edges ) . as also found in other similar data sets @xcite , the distribution of degrees ( the degree of a node is the number of other nodes it is connected to ) is narrow ( @xmath50 ) . the average degree , i.e. , the average number of students each student had contact with , is @xmath51 . on the other hand ,",
    "the distribution of links weights , i.e. , of the total time spent in contact by pairs of students , is broad : the average cumulated duration is of @xmath52 seconds ( @xmath53 minutes ) , but most weights are much smaller ( @xmath54 of the links have a weight smaller than @xmath55 minutes ) and large values are also observed ( @xmath56 of the weights are larger than @xmath57 minutes and @xmath58 are larger than @xmath42 hour ) .",
    "overall , the distribution spans several orders of magnitude ( cv = @xmath59 ) and no characteristic interaction timescale can be naturally defined .",
    "the population of interest is structured into @xmath7 classes .",
    "we compute the contact matrices defined above to describe the mixing patterns between these classes ( see si ) . as also observed in @xcite",
    ", most contacts occur within classes , and students of different classes have very few contacts : @xmath60 contacts ( @xmath61 of the total ) , representing a cumulated duration of @xmath62 ( @xmath63 of the total contact time of students ) , were recorded between pairs of students belonging to the same class .",
    "an additional substructure of three groups of three classes each emerges moreover : ( i ) classes mp , mp*1 , mp*2 , ( ii ) classes pc , pc * , psi * , ( iii ) classes 2bio1 , 2bio2 , 2bio3 .",
    "more contacts are observed between students of two classes in the same group than between students of two different groups .",
    "this substructure corresponds to a grouping of classes according to the studied field , but could also be reinforced by the fact that the classrooms of each group are physically close in the high school .",
    "we finally mention that the number of contacts fluctuates strongly throughout the day , along a robust daily pattern driven by the occurrence of class breaks and lunches . as in @xcite ,",
    "the daily contact matrices are very similar to each other ( with cosine similarities between matrices ranging from @xmath64 to @xmath65 ) .",
    "overall , although the contacts occurring in different days are not all the same , the temporal daily fluctuations and the mixing patterns between classes are robust across different days .      as mentioned above",
    ", the contact diaries yield a directed weighted network of reported contacts between students .",
    "only @xmath9 students filled in a contact diary , yielding a network of reported contacts of @xmath9 nodes and @xmath66 directed , weighted edges among them . note that we ignore the contacts reported with students who did not fill a diary .",
    "moreover , in the following we consider only students for whom the sensors also registered contact data during the day concerned by the contact diary .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath67 students and @xmath68 directed weighted links .",
    "@xmath69 contacts were reported by only one student ( non - reciprocated links ) , while the reciprocated links correspond to @xmath70 pairs of students reporting both a contact with each other .",
    "moreover , reciprocated links were sometimes reported with different durations by the two students involved .",
    "table [ table : diary ] gives the corresponding statistics . in @xmath71 cases out of @xmath70",
    ", both students involved reported the same duration category . in @xmath72 cases ,",
    "the reports of the two involved students differed by only one category .",
    "these results are similar to the ones of @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we moreover compute the probability @xmath73 to report a contact of a certain duration , under the hypothesis that such probability depends only on the duration .",
    "if @xmath74 is the real number of contacts , and @xmath75 is the number of pairs of students reporting both the contact , then @xmath76 , while the number of contacts reported by only one student is @xmath77 ; as a result , the estimate of @xmath73 is given by @xmath78 .",
    "we obtain that the overall reporting probability is @xmath79 . assuming that the correct duration of a reported contact is the highest reported value",
    ", we obtain that the probability to report a contact is @xmath80 for contacts of less than @xmath44 min , @xmath81 for contacts between @xmath82 and @xmath57 min , @xmath83 for contacts between @xmath84 and @xmath85 min , and @xmath86 for contacts with aggregate duration longer than one hour .",
    "these numbers are in - between the values reported in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "they share with these previous studies the fact that the reporting probability increases strongly with the contact duration .",

    "we therefore consider on the one hand the weighted network of the contacts registered by the sensors on dec .",
    "@xmath119 , and on the other hand the symmetrized version of the network obtained from the contact diaries , in which the highest value of the aggregated contact duration reported by two students is retained .",
    "table [ table : contact_vs_diaries ] reports some properties of these networks . as not all students filled in contact diaries , we moreover report the networks properties when restricted to the nodes present in both ( @xmath67 nodes ) . the density and average degree of the contact network obtained by the sensors are almost twice as large as the ones obtained using contact diaries , but the degree distributions have similar shapes ( see si ) .",
    "the cliques are also larger in the contact network , while the average shortest path length is smaller ( the distributions of shortest path lengths is shown in the si ) : nodes seem farther apart in the contact diary network than in the sensor data network .",
    "the average clustering on the other hand is similar .",
    "interestingly , the strongly structured character of the contact network , as highlighted by the dominance of the diagonal elements of the contact matrices and the existence of groups of classes , is well preserved in the contact diary network , as shown in fig .",
