    "years of experimental and theoretical research on quantum information science have revealed the numerous difficulties that must be overcome to build a large - scale quantum computer .",
    "such a computer could factor large numbers and search unstructured databases far more efficiently than any classical computer . to pave the road to quantum computer implementations ,",
    "we first need to master few - qubit technology .",
    "one appealing approach to the latter problem uses optics - based configurations for quantum processors .",
    "light can carry quantum information in the form of single - photon polarization states , or vacuum plus single - photon superpositions .",
    "spontaneous parametric down - conversion can produce entangled photon pairs and heralded single photons .",
    "beam splitters and wave plates can be used to convert between single - photon polarization and vacuum plus single - photon qubits .",
    "they can also accomplish arbitrary single - qubit rotations . to complete a universal gate set for quantum computation ,",
    "all that is then needed is an appropriate two - qubit quantum gate , such as a controlled - not ( cnot ) gate .",
    "a universal gate set will also serve quantum communication systems , in that it can realize their required full bell - state measurement ( bsm ) device .",
    "realizing an all - optical cnot requires a nonlinear interaction between single photons , but traditional nonlinear materials offer only weak coupling between single photons .",
    "linear optics quantum computing @xcite circumvents this difficulty by using photodetection and post - selection to provide a strong nonlinearity at the cost of a non - deterministic architecture that needs substantial ancillary resources .",
    "electromagnetically - induced transparency @xcite may afford a strong cross - kerr effect at the single - photon level , and lead to a deterministic all - optical cnot implementation .",
    "munro , nemoto , and spiller @xcite , however , have made a rather different suggestion for an all - optical cnot . by successive _",
    "weak  cross - kerr interactions between a strong coherent - state probe beam  that acts as a quantum communication bus  and a pair of single - photon qubit beams they realize a deterministic parity gate from which a cnot can be constructed . their parity gate can also be used to realize a full bsm apparatus .",
    "munro , nemoto , and spiller use a single - mode treatment of cross - phase modulation ( xpm ) to show that their parity gate achieves near - ideal performance .",
    "it has been known for some time , however , that a proper quantum theory for self - phase modulation ( spm ) requires a continuous - time multi - mode theory @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have recently extended the continuous - time quantum theory of spm to the case of xpm @xcite .",
    "using that theory we proved that the phase noises needed to ensure preservation of the free - field commutator brackets at the output of the xpm interaction precluded high - fidelity operation of the quantum phase gate proposed by chuang and yamamoto @xcite , which relies on a _ strong _ nonlinear interaction between two single photons in a cross - kerr medium .",
    "the question that we will address in the present paper is whether a similar fidelity degradation will occur in the parity gate from @xcite when its performance is assessed in the continuous - time framework .",
    "_    there are two issues that necessitate employing a continuous - time model for the cross - kerr effect .",
    "first , the photonic qubits at the input to and output from a quantum gate will be flying qubits , i.e. , free - field optical pulses .",
    "single - mode treatments of the quantum gate that ignore the temporal behavior of the optical pulses have assumed  either explicitly or implicitly  that gate operation occurs within a high - finesse cavity .",
    "however , even then free - field inputs and outputs must be properly accounted for so that the fidelity of a multi - gate quantum circuit can be determined . in other words , if we put our optical gate in a black box , then its input - output relation is a transformation from a continuous - time free - field operator at its input to another continuous - time free - field operator at its output .",
    "the second issue that requires a multi - mode treatment of xpm , is the non - instantaneous nature of the cross - kerr interaction .",
    "optical fibers have a 510  fs response time for the spm interaction @xcite , and a similar response time is expected for xpm .",
    "the response time of the nonlinear material plays a key role in its quantum behavior when single - photon pulses are involved . for example , we have shown @xcite that if the xpm response time is much shorter than the time duration of a pair of single - photon input pulses , then essentially no xpm phase shift will occur on these pulses even when the peak nonlinear phase shift from a single photon is the @xmath0rad that chuang and yamamoto require for their single - photon controlled - phase gate @xcite . this counter - intuitive behavior occurs because the @xmath0-rad phase shift only affects a very short  and randomly - distributed in time ",
    "portion of the single - photon pulse .",
    "conversely , in the slow - response regime  wherein the optical pulses are much shorter than the xpm response time  we can adjust the timing of the input single - photon pulses so that one photon can induce an appreciable xpm phase shift on the other .",
    "for an xpm medium whose response function is causal and non - instantaneous , preservation of the free - field commutator relations for the output field operators imposes phase noise terms on these outputs .",
    "these phase noises will be seen , in this paper , to severely degrade the fidelity of the parity gate proposed by munro , nemoto , and spiller .",
    "it will also be shown that the mean - squared phase noise is proportional to the response function s amplitude , implying that stronger nonlinearity is accompanied by increased phase noise .    in this paper , we first summarize the model introduced in @xcite for the xpm interaction , which applies in the absence of loss , dispersion , and spm .",
    "then , in section  [ sec5coh ] , we apply the slow - response version of this model to a simple gate in which a single - photon pulse induces a weak phase shift on a coherent - state probe beam .",
    "this gate is the building block for the munro , nemoto , and spiller parity gate , which will be described and analyzed in section  [ sec5parity ] . that treatment constitutes the continuous - time fidelity analysis of their parity gate .",
    "section  [ sec5numeric ] includes some numerical results , which quantify the parity gate s phase - noise induced fidelity loss .",
    "section  [ sec5conc ] concludes the paper by discussing the applicability of our results to different scenarios .",
    "in this section , we describe the continuous - time model for xpm , introduced in @xcite .",
    "this model applies primarily to the kerr interactions that occur in a length of a macroscopic material , e.g. , an optical fiber .",
    "hence , its input and output field operators are free fields . whereas discrete modes are proper choices for modeling light that is confined in a cavity , a continuous - time formalism is more appropriate for free - field operators . in this formalism , a positive - frequency photon - units field operator associated with a @xmath1-going electric field , in a well - defined polarization , can be written as follows @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the annihilation operator associated with frequency @xmath4 that satisfies @xmath5 = \\delta ( \\omega - \\omega')$ ] .",
    "the limits of integration in ( [ fieldop ] ) are from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "however , for the optical sources we shall consider , whose bandwidths are narrow in comparison to their common center frequency @xmath8 , we can extend the integral s lower limit to @xmath9 .",
    "it then follows that @xmath10 = \\delta ( t - t')\\ ] ] is the free - field commutator .    for our later calculations it will be useful to write our field operators in terms of a discrete set of basis functions :",
    "@xmath11 where @xmath12 is a complete orthonormal set of functions satisfying @xmath13 and @xmath14 is a discrete - mode annihilation operator , which satisfies @xmath15 = \\delta _ { ij}$ ] .",
    "equation ( [ ctod ] ) provides us with a prescription for converting a continuous - time field operator to a sum of discrete - mode operators , where each mode has a pulse shape orthogonal to that of the other modes .",
    "we will use this formalism frequently in forthcoming sections .",
    "strictly speaking , such a discrete representation should be applied to a time - limited or band - limited field , but inasmuch as we will only need one mode per field for our study of slow - response xpm , no loss of generality is entailed by use of ( [ ctod ] ) .     modeling the cross - kerr nonlinearity using input / output field operators . here ,",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are phase - noise operators , while @xmath18 and @xmath19 are xpm operators that depend on the probe - beam and signal - beam photon - flux operators , respectively , as well as the medium s response function.,height=75 ]    now , let us begin our consideration of the kerr medium .",
    "we will assume that there is no loss , no dispersion , and no spm in this medium .",
    "furthermore , we denote the photon - units input field operators by @xmath20 for the signal beam and @xmath21 for the probe beam , whose respective photon - units output field operators are @xmath22 and @xmath23 ; see figure  [ shapiro_razavi_fig1 ] .",
    "then , the input - output relationship for this material is given by @xcite @xmath24 where we have suppressed the group delay , and @xmath25 gives the xpm phase shifts on the signal and the probe beams .",
    "here , @xmath26 is the xpm coupling coefficient , and @xmath27 is a causal response function , which has been normalized to satisfy @xmath28 . equation ( [ kerr_effect ] ) is in accord with our semiclassical understanding of the kerr effect , in which we assume that the nonlinear operators responsible for the kerr effect are proportional to the photon - flux operators . this is what we expect to hold for an ideal cross - kerr medium .",
    "however , for the output - field operators to commute with each other , i.e. , @xmath29 =   [ \\hat e'_s(t),\\hat e'^\\dag_p(t ' ) ] = 0,\\ ] ] as is the case for their corresponding input - field operators , we need to include a pair of langevin noise operators .",
    "these noise operators represent coupling to localized noise oscillators that typically represent the molecular vibrations in the medium , and they result in hermitian phase - noise operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the field - operator input - output relations ( [ output_kerr ] ) .",
    "the coupling coefficient between the light and the corresponding reservoir mode at frequency @xmath32 turns out to be proportional to @xmath33 , where @xmath34 must be non - negative for @xmath35 , so that all the damping coefficients are positive .",
    "furthermore , equation  ( [ output_commut ] ) requires that @xcite @xmath36 = i\\kappa [ h(u - t ) - h(t - u)].\\ ] ] in thermal equilibrium , @xmath30 and @xmath31 can be taken to be in zero - mean joint gaussian states with the following symmetrized correlation function @xmath37\\cos[\\omega(t - u ) ] } , \\quad\\mbox{for $ k = s , p$,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the thermal fluctuation energy .",
    "the above model for xpm has several interesting implications .",
    "first , from equation  ( [ phase_corr ] ) , it is seen that the phase noise variance at time @xmath39 , @xmath40 , for @xmath41 , is nonzero even if @xmath42 .",
    "this can result from photon - phonon interactions in the medium @xcite .",
    "second , it can be easily shown that an instantaneous response function in this model can not reproduce the well - known classical results for xpm @xcite .",
    "the fact that the response function has a nonzero effective time duration @xmath43 becomes important when we are dealing with single - photon pulse inputs , because the nonlinear phase shift imparted by a single - photon pulse depends on its duration being greater or smaller than @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "let us elaborate more on this issue by considering the special case of a single - photon signal input in the slow - response regime .",
    "a single - photon signal pulse can be represented by the following state @xmath44 where the wave function @xmath45 satisfies @xmath46 . here , @xmath47 is a multi - mode state that represents a single photon at time @xmath39 ; it satisfies @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the multi - mode vacuum state for the signal beam .",
    "it follows that @xmath50 is the probability density function for observing this photon at time @xmath39 .",
    "equivalently , we can use the discrete formalism from equation  ( [ ctod ] ) by employing a complete orthonormal basis in which @xmath51 .",
    "using such a basis , we have that @xmath52 is a state for which @xmath53 is in the number state @xmath54 , while the other @xmath55 are in their vacuum states .",
    "the average xpm phase - shift factor introduced by this single photon on the probe beam is therefore @xmath56 where we have used @xcite @xmath57 = { \\cal{n } } \\left\\ { \\exp\\left[\\int\\!{{\\rm d } t\\ , ( e^{g(t)}-1 ) \\hat e^\\dag(t ) \\hat e(t)}\\right ] \\right \\},\\ ] ] with @xmath58 denoting the normally - ordered form of the operator @xmath59 .    in the _ slow - response _ regime",
    ", @xmath60 behaves like @xmath61 , relative to @xmath62 , for an appropriate @xmath63 near the pulse s center . in other words ,",
    "the signal pulse s time duration , @xmath64 , is much shorter than @xmath43 , the time duration of the response function . from equation  ( [ ph_sph ] ) , we then obtain @xmath65 now , if the probe pulse shape .",
    "this assumption is not essential , however , for our current discussion of the slow - response xpm .",
    "all we really need is for the probe pulse s effective duration to be comparable to that of the signal pulse , and hence much shorter than that of the response function .",
    "] is @xmath66 , then the phase shift induced by our single photon on the probe s pulse at @xmath67 is @xmath68 .",
    "we can maximize this phase shift by choosing @xmath69 , where @xmath70 $ ] .    given that @xmath71 for optical fiber",
    ", it is impractical to work in its slow - response regime .",
    "however , this is the only regime in which a useful quantum interaction may be seen . in the fast - response regime  in which , @xmath72only",
    "a @xmath43-duration portion of the probe pulse undergoes a nonlinear phase shift , and the time location of this region is randomly distributed over the entire probe pulse with probability density function @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "this property of the fast - response regime precludes its being useful for optics - based quantum computation .",
    "therefore , we will limit our subsequent work to the slow - response regime .",
    "if promising results are obtained , it will then behoove us to find a kerr medium with a more useful response time , where @xmath73 is the spm response function for the probe beam . ] .",
    "consider a kerr medium with xpm coupling constant @xmath26 and a response function @xmath27 , in which there is no loss , no dispersion , and no spm .",
    "suppose we illuminate this medium with a signal pulse and a probe pulse , with the former being in a superposition of the vacuum state and the single - photon state with pulse shape @xmath74 , viz .",
    ", @xmath75 with @xmath76 , and the latter being in the coherent state @xmath77 , for which @xmath78 . in the mode - decomposition formalism",
    ", we can think of the signal pulse as being in the superposition state @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the fock state associated with the modal annihilation operator @xmath81 .",
    "similarly , the probe beam can be taken to be in a coherent state @xmath82 associated with the modal annihilation operator @xmath83 .",
    "all other input modes are in their vacuum states .",
    "the time shift between the signal and probe pulses results in the signal s inducing the maximum nonlinear phase shift on the probe pulse in the slow - response regime .",
    "the goal of this section is to determine the output density operator for this simple gate , which is a building block for the parity gate that will be studied in the next section .    in order to find the density operator ,",
    "we first find the normally - ordered characteristic functional for the output field operators @xmath22 and @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath84 the exact evaluation of the above functional is , in general , a tedious task .",
    "however , for operation within the slow - response regime , it is sufficient to employ the discrete - mode picture , characterized by the @xmath85 and @xmath86 modes , for the input field operators , in which @xmath87 because the slow - response condition ensures that the output field operators will then obey @xmath88 the two implicit assumptions in the above equations are @xmath89 and @xmath90 , where @xmath63 is the center of @xmath91 , and @xmath92 is the delay between the signal and the probe beams at which the maximum nonlinearity will be induced .",
    "now , it is easy to see that if @xmath93 and @xmath94 , then the averaging in equation  ( [ chct ] ) is over the vacuum modes , whose normally - ordered characteristic functions are unity",
    ". hence , the only functions for which the value of @xmath95 is nontrivial are @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "an equivalent characteristic function can then be obtained using the discrete - mode operators @xmath98 where @xmath99 and similarly , @xmath100 in both equations  ( [ signalph ] ) and ( [ probeph ] ) we have dropped number - operator terms for modes that are in their vacuum states .",
    "equation ( [ signalph ] ) reflects the fact that the probe beam does not phase shift the signal pulse , because it lags the signal pulse in time and the cross - kerr effect is causal . on the other hand ,",
    "the signal pulse induces a phase shift @xmath101 on the probe beam , as shown in equation  ( [ probeph ] ) .",

    "using this fact , we then obtain for arbitrary complex parameters @xmath117 and @xmath118 @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are independent , identically distributed , zero - mean , real - valued gaussian variables with common variance @xmath122 .",
    "an interesting observation is that for nonzero values of @xmath117 and @xmath118 , there exists a nontrivial phase shift @xmath123 , even when the phase - noise variance @xmath122 approaches zero .",
    "this is a consequence of the non - commuting nature of the phase - noise operators @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the above formula makes it possible to handle the phase - noise averaging in equation  ( [ chavg ] ) .",
    "in particular , it is easy to verify that the following density operator corresponds to the characteristic function @xmath124 @xmath125 the final averaging over the classical variables will be applied later , when we calculate the fidelity of the parity gate .",
    "it is important to note that the density operator predicted by a single - mode xpm theory , as used in @xcite does _ not  coincide with the above density operator evaluated at zero phase - noise variance , i.e. , at @xmath126 . whereas the first two terms in equation  ( [ sprho ] ) also appear in the density operator associated with the single - mode treatment , this is not the case for the last two terms .",
    "the reason for this difference is the extra phase term that appeared in equation  ( [ phnavg ] ) because of the non - commuting nature of the signal and probe phase - noise operators . _",
    "a parity gate accepts two input qubits , in the general form @xmath127 , and it provides a classical outcome that heralds whether the output is the even - parity state @xmath128 or the odd - parity state @xmath129 .",
    "munro , nemoto , and spiller @xcite cascaded two single - photon / coherent - state xpm interactions to produce the all - optical parity gate shown in figure  [ shapiro_razavi_fig2 ] , from which an all - optical cnot can be constructed . in this scheme , alice ( @xmath130 ) and bob ( @xmath131 ) encode their qubits in the horizontal ( @xmath132 ) and vertical ( @xmath133 ) polarizations of their respective single - photon pulses , but only alice s @xmath132 polarization and bob s @xmath133 polarization interact with the coherent - state probe .",
    "a single photon on alice s @xmath132 mode will impart a weak phase shift @xmath134 to the probe beam , as will a single photon on bob s @xmath133 mode .",
    "munro , nemoto , and spiller @xcite used a single - mode treatment of xpm to show that it should be possible to distinguish between even and odd parity states with high fidelity . in this section we will use continuous - time xpm theory , in the slow - response regime , to provide a more accurate fidelity analysis for their parity gate . our conclusion about the viability of the figure  [ shapiro_razavi_fig2 ] gate will be rather different from theirs .     an optics - based distributed parity gate that uses a weak cross - kerr nonlinearity .",
    "alice and bob encode their qubits ( single photons ) in the horizontal and vertical polarizations of single - photon pulses . the polarizing beam splitters ( pbs )",
    "guide alice s horizontal polarization and bob s vertical polarization to a kerr medium in which they interact with a coherent - state probe beam .",

    "when @xmath151 is an odd integer , we can apply a @xmath0-rad phase shift to make all the @xmath148 observations result in the odd - parity output state @xmath152 .",
    "a key figure of merit for the distributed parity gate is the success - probability distribution , @xmath153 , i.e. , the probability of being in the desired state @xmath154 when @xmath151 probe photons have been detected .",
    "the total success probability is then given by @xmath155 where @xmath156}$ ] denotes bloch - sphere averaging , @xmath157 is the average success probability for the even - parity case , and @xmath158 is the average success probability for the odd - parity case .",
    "the preceding single - mode treatment shows that @xmath159 yields near - unity success probability , whereas @xmath160 leads to @xmath161 indicating that it is then impossible to distinguish between the odd- and even - parity states in @xmath162 .",
    "the single - mode model , however , does not account for the causality - induced phase noise that is intrinsic to continuous - time xpm theory .",
    "to evaluate the fidelity of the parity gate , for the slow - response - regime continuous - time theory , we employ the formalism introduced in the previous section . for simplicity , we assume alice and bob are in a normalized tensor - product state @xmath163 , where @xmath164 with @xmath165 here , @xmath166 , for @xmath167 , represents the qubit that has nonlinear interaction with the probe beam , and , for simplicity , we have assumed that there is no propagation delay between @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "hence , according to figure  [ shapiro_razavi_fig2 ] , the following correspondence holds between the number of excitations and the polarizations of alice s and bob s qubits : @xmath168 the probe beam is in the time - shifted coherent state @xmath169 that undergoes the maximum nonlinear phase shifts from alice s and bob s qubits .",
    "then , the output density operator for alice , bob , and the probe can be obtained by using the density operator in equation  ( [ sprho ] ) twice ; once for the alice - probe interaction and once for the bob - probe interaction .",
    "note that the density operator for the state associated with field operators @xmath170 and @xmath23 is given exactly by equation  ( [ sprho ] ) , by replacing the @xmath171 subscripts with @xmath130 s .",

    "the last step is to replace @xmath172 with @xmath173 to incorporate the effects of the phase shifter and the displacement operation . the final density operator is then given by the following equation , in which the states are associated with the output annihilation operators @xmath174 , @xmath175 , and @xmath176 : @xmath177 where @xmath178 @xmath179 @xmath180 and the average in equation  ( [ rhoapb ] ) is taken over the phase noise terms @xmath181 , @xmath182 , and @xmath121 , which are statistically independent zero - mean gaussian random variables with respective variances @xmath183 and @xmath184 .    using the above density operator ,",

    "overall , based on our continuous - time theory for the cross - kerr effect , it seems that for the optimum performance of the gate we have to satisfy the following three conditions simultaneously : @xmath200 in the next section , we numerically evaluate @xmath191 and @xmath192first with arbitrary choices of @xmath201 and @xmath202 and then with a two - pole response function  to investigate whether these constraints can be satisfied .",

    "[ shapiro_razavi_fig4 ] , it can be seen that @xmath191 is independent of @xmath101 , whereas @xmath192 requires @xmath210 to achieve reasonable performance .",

    "suppose @xmath27 is the two - pole response function associated with the two - pole frequency response @xmath225 where @xmath226 is the vibrational resonance frequency of the medium and @xmath227 is a damping rate .",
    "this function is a good fit to the actual raman - gain spectrum of silica fibers in the underdamped single resonance regime @xmath228 , @xcite , in which @xmath229 previous work using this response function in the continuous - time xpm model has shown @xcite that the best system performance occurs when @xmath223 and @xmath224 , in which case , we have @xmath230 for @xmath224 , we have @xmath231 , from which it follows that @xmath232 , i.e. , higher nonlinearity comes at the price of more phase noise .",

    "it can be seen that optimum system performance is achieved at a low value of @xmath222 , for which @xmath203 is only about @xmath234 .",
    "this agrees with what we observed before . for high values of @xmath222",
    ", we have that @xmath235 also has a high value , which , in turn , degrades the even - parity performance .",
    "for low values of @xmath222 , @xmath236 because @xmath237 in equation  ( [ podd ] ) .",
    "the results shown in figure  [ shapiro_razavi_fig5 ] demonstrate that our causal , non - instantaneous model for the cross - kerr effect precludes the distributed parity gate s achieving high success - probability operation .",
    "one should also bear in mind that the fidelity we have derived is for the ideal case of no loss , no dispersion , and no spm .",
    "each of these effects can by itself significantly degrade system performance .",
    "moreover , the above performance has been achieved under the slow - response conditions , which makes its practical application to fiber - based xpm highly questionable",
    ". however , there are still two other issues that should be addressed before coming to a definite conclusion about the parity gate s feasibility . first , within the range of validity of our model , we may still be able to do better if we choose an optimum response function for our medium .",
    "the material s normalized response function @xmath27 must be causal and satisfy the following conditions @xmath238 the above constraints define a convex set of functions . in this set ,",
    "we are interested in finding the function @xmath27 that maximizes the success probability of the gate .",
    "an easier problem is to find the function @xmath27 that maximizes the ratio @xmath239 .",
    "both these problems are analytically , as well as numerically , difficult .",
    "even if we knew such a function , it would be difficult to find a material with the desired response function .",
    "nevertheless , it would be interesting to find the ultimate possible performance of the parity gate using our continuous - time model for the cross - kerr effect .",
    "the second issue is the applicability of our model to atomic systems , possibly under electromagnetically - induced transparency conditions @xcite , illuminated by single photons .",
    "there are several proposals that use such systems to provide an effective cross - kerr nonlinearity for single photons @xcite .",
    "our model may or may not be applicable to such scenarios . in our model , we translate what we expect to occur classically in a pure cross - kerr medium into quantum field - operator language , and then we make it self - consistent by introducing phase noise operators with appropriate commutators .",
    "this is not necessarily what happens when a photon interacts with a single atom or a small ensemble of atoms . in these atom - interaction scenarios we expect to get some pulse - shape broadening , but how to relate this effect to our medium s response function is yet to be investigated , although the work reported in @xcite may be of value in this regard",
    ". moreover , if the physical reason behind the phase noise and the non - instantaneous response function is molecular vibrations , it is logical to ask how much vibrational noise a single photon may encounter when it interacts with a small number of atoms . in other words , if we do nt expect that atomic vibrations are at all significant at the single - photon level , do we need to worry about phase noise or not ?",
    "these concerns prevent us from immediately generalizing our assessment of the parity gate to all its possible implementations .",
    "nevertheless , a full field - operator treatment of the nonlinear behavior of atomic systems in response to single - photon pulses needs to be developed to properly answer the preceding questions , as the analysis we have presented for continuous - time xpm suggests that initial assessments of xpm - based two - qubit optical gates may be overly ( perhaps even wildly ) optimistic .",
