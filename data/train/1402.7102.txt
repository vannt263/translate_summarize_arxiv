    "the gas dynamics in protoplanetary disks ( ppds ) plays a crucial role in essentially every aspect of planet formation .",
    "this is mainly because small dust grains are coupled with the gas aerodynamically , while large solids are coupled with the gas gravitationally .",
    "the global structure of the disk , as well as the level of turbulence are of particular importance .",
    "for example , the transport and growth of dust grains are sensitive to both the radial pressure gradient and turbulence in ppds ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the formation of planetesimals via collective effects such as streaming and gravitational instabilities likely favors regions with small radial pressure gradient and low levels of turbulence ( e.g. @xcite ) , dust grains may be trapped in vortices due to the rossby wave instability at the pressure maxima produced at inner dead zone edges ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the growth of planetesimals into planetary cores may be suppressed when turbulence is strong which will gravitationally excite their eccentricities , leading to destructive collisions ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the migration of low to high mass planets , as well as gas accretion onto planetary cores , are all sensitive to the radial disk structure as well as the local microphysics ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    the global structure of a ppd is mainly shaped by the process of angular momentum transport , and the underlying mechanism largely dictates the level of turbulence in the disk .",
    "therefore , the key to understanding the gas dynamics of ppds lies in determining the mechanism of angular momentum transport , which is most likely magnetic in nature ( see the most recent review by @xcite ) .",
    "the most important constraint on such mechanisms comes from the fact that ppds are actively accreting , with typical accretion rates of @xmath10 yr@xmath9 @xcite over the lifetime of about 1 - 10 myrs @xcite , indicating efficient angular momentum transport must take place in the entire disk .",
    "two leading mechanisms to transport angular momentum in accretion disks include the magnetorotational instability ( mri , @xcite ) and the magnetocentrifugal wind ( mcw , @xcite ) . the former generates strong turbulence , which transports angular momentum radially outward within the disk as a viscous process ( e.g. , @xcite ) , while the latter extracts angular momentum from the disk vertically , which is then carried array by the wind . the details about whether and how these mechanisms operate in ppds largely depend on how gas and magnetic field are coupled within the disk , as well as the geometry of the magnetic field .",
    "fully ionized gas can generally be well described by ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) where the gas and magnetic field are perfectly coupled with infinite conductivity .",
    "in contrast , the extremely weakly ionized gas present in ppds is subject to three non - ideal mhd effects : ohmic resistivity , the hall effect , and ambipolar diffusion ( ad ) .",
    "these effects weaken the coupling between gas and magnetic fields in different ways , leading to a reduced level of the mri turbulence or even fully suppressing the mri @xcite .",
    "they also strongly affect the launching process of the mcw @xcite .",
    "calculations of ionization - recombination chemistry to infer the level of ionization in ppds demonstrate that all three non - ideal mhd effects are relevant and important in ppds @xcite . in particular , ohmic resistivity dominates in high densities with weak magnetic field , applicable to the midplane region of the inner disk ( @xmath11au ) .",
    "ad dominates in low density regions with strong magnetic field , applicable to the surface region of the inner disk , as well as the bulk of the outer disk ( @xmath12au ) .",
    "the hall - dominated regime lies in between , which covers a large fraction of ppds , particularly the planet - forming regions .",
    "the role of ohmic resistivity has been the major focus for most works in the literature , and has lead to the standard picture of layered accretion @xcite , followed by nearly two decades of further developments from linear theory @xcite to numerical simulations with increasing level of complexity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these works have firmly established that the mri does not operate in the midplane region of the inner disk ( @xmath11 au ) due to excessively large resistivity .",
    "this region is termed the dead zone .",
    "since ohmic resistivity is completely negligible at the disk surface , the surface region is fully mri turbulent and is termed as the active layer .",
    "the dead zone also has an inner edge ( @xmath13 au ) within which the mri is activated due to thermal ionization of alkali species @xcite .",
    "ambipolar diffusion ( ad ) is the second non - ideal mhd effect that receives considerable attention @xcite .",
    "non - linear simulations of the mri with ad ( @xcite , in the  strong - coupling \" limit applicable to weakly ionized gas ) showed that in the ad - dominated regime , the mri operates only when the magnetic field is sufficiently weak with reduced level of turbulence .",
    "this finding led @xcite and @xcite to conclude that mri is insufficient to drive rapid accretion at the observed rate of @xmath14 yr@xmath9 by at least one order of magnitude , at least in the inner disk .",
    "recently , it has been demonstrated that when both ohmic resistivity and ad are taken into account with a self - consistent treatment of ionization - recombination chemistry , mri is either extremely inefficient or completely suppressed ( depending on magnetic field geometry ) in the inner region of ppds @xcite . while this result seems surprising ,",
    "it is consistent with theoretical expectations , because the conventional  active layer \" is ad dominated , and ad at the disk surface is strong enough to suppress the mri . without the mri , accretion is found to be efficiently driven by the mcw , and the desired rate of @xmath14 yr@xmath9 can be easily achieved when the disk is threaded by some weak net vertical magnetic field . toward the outer disk where",
    "ad is expected to be the sole dominant non - ideal mhd effect , mri is able to operate ; but to achieve sufficient accretion rate , again net vertical magnetic flux is essential @xcite .",
    "these results are pointing to a paradigm shift in our understanding of the gas dynamics in ppds , highlighting the importance of mcw and external magnetic field .",
    "the hall effect is the last non - ideal mhd effect yet to be included in self - consistent models of ppds .",
    "it has been shown to strongly affect the the linear properties of the mri @xcite .",
    "non - linear simulations which included both ohmic resistivity and the hall effect indicated that the hall term changes the saturation level of the mri @xcite .",
    "more recent simulations by @xcite showed that when the hall term is sufficiently strong , the system transitions into a  low transport state \" characterized by a strong zonal field without transporting angular momentum .",
    "these non - linear simulations highlight the potentially dramatic effect of the hall term , and raise concerns about the neglect of the hall effect in most previous studies .",
    "the hall effect also affects the wind launching process hence the properties of the magnetic wind , as studied in detail in @xcite and @xcite , who extend the early work of @xcite .",
    "these authors identified the wind launching criteria in the presence of all three non - ideal mhd effects separated in different regimes and presented representative wind solutions .",
    "these works provided an important theoretical framework for the general behavior of the wind solution .",
    "their primary limitations are unrealistic assumptions of constant elsasser numbers ( of order unity ) and strong vertical magnetic field ( near equipartition at the midplane ) .",
    "a special consequence of the hall effect is that it makes the gas dynamics depend on magnetic polarity : reversing the magnetic field would violate the original dynamical equations and hence a different configuration is required . since the hall effect is prominent over a wide range of disk radii ,",
    "the gas dynamics of ppds is largely hall - controlled , and one expects it to bifurcate into two branches with different field configurations and flow properties depending on the polarity of the external magnetic field .",
    "this paper , together with the companion paper , represent the first effort to explore the role of the hall effect in ppds using non - linear mhd simulations with a self - consistent treatment of the ionization - recombination chemistry .",
    "they serve as an extension of the recent work by @xcite and @xcite by further including the hall effect . in this first paper , we focus on the inner part of the disk ( @xmath15 au ) where mri is expected to be suppressed over the entire vertical extent of the disk . we show that the conclusion that the mri is suppressed with mcw - driven accretion still holds , while the property of the mcw is different and depends on the polarity of the external large - scale magnetic field .",
    "we are aware of the work of @xcite , submitted the same time as the present paper , who emphasize magnetic field amplification and enhanced magnetic braking due to the hall effect .",
    "our results are consistent with theirs , while there are a number of differences which will be briefly discussed . in the companion paper",
    ", we focus on the outer region of ppds and address how the behavior of the mri is affected by the hall effect .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "given the increasing level of complexity compared with previous works , especially involving the full non - ideal mhd physics , we devote section 2 to background information intended to guide the readers through the formulation and the role played by individual non - ideal mhd effects , highlighting the new features introduced by the hall term .",
    "section 3 describes the methodology of our numerical simulations as well as the simulation runs . in section 4",
    ", we focus on a particular set of simulations with fiducial parameters and discuss how the hall effect modifies the original wind solution obtained by @xcite and the properties of the new wind solutions .",
    "we then extend the results with a much broader range of parameters in section 5 . in section 6",
    "we discuss the implications of our findings and conclude .",
    "we plan to study the local gas dynamics of ppds across a wide range of disk radii .",
    "since we are interested in short timescales ( @xmath16 local orbital time , compared with the disk lifetime ) , we adopt a fixed disk model without worrying about global disk evolution . as a convention",
    ", we use the minimum - mass solar nebular ( mmsn ) disk as our standard model , with surface density and temperature given by @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is disk radius measured in au .",
    "we treat the disk as vertically isothermal , with isothermal sound speed given by @xmath19 ( mean molecular weight @xmath20 ) . while in reality the disk is hotter at the surface and colder in the midplane due to stellar irradiation , we are mainly interested in the role played by magnetic fields which is likely the primary driving force of disk angular momentum transport , and we leave more realistic treatment of thermodynamics for future work .",
    "we study the gas dynamics in ppds using the standard local shearing - sheet approximation @xcite , where mhd equations are written in cartesian coordinates in the corotating frame at a fiducial radius @xmath21 with keplerian frequency @xmath22 .",
    "the radial , azimuthal , and vertical dimensions are represented by @xmath23 and @xmath24 coordinates .",
    "background keplerian shear @xmath25 is subtracted from the formulation , with @xmath26 and @xmath27 denoting gas density and ( background shear subtracted ) velocity , respectively . including the stellar vertical gravity , the equations read @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the magnetic field , whose unit is such that magnetic permeability is 1 , and @xmath31 is the current density .",
    "we use an isothermal equation of state with @xmath32 . in hydrostatic equilibrium",
    ", the gas density profile follows @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the midplane gas density , and @xmath35 is the disk scale height .    for very weakly ionized gas as in ppds , the above single - fluid equations describe the dynamics for the bulk of the neutral gas .",
    "note that the neutral gas also feels the lorentz force , which is effectively achieved by colliding with charged particles .",
    "the charged particles contain negligible inertia , and in the dense environment of ppds ( collision frequency with the neutrals is much higher than orbital frequency ) , their dynamics is fully determined by the balance between lorentz force and collisional drag with the neutrals . in this",
    "so - called  strong coupling \" limit , multi - fluid equations are unnecessary .",
    "the motion of charged particles simply provides the conductivity for the bulk of the gas , which is generally anisotropic due to the presence of magnetic field . reflecting to the induction equation ,",
    "such anisotropic conductivity introduces three non - ideal mhd effects in addition to the normal inductive term    @xmath36    with @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the electric field ( in the comoving frame ) due to non - ideal mhd terms , @xmath39 denotes the unit vector along @xmath30 , subscript ",
    "@xmath40 \" denotes the vector component perpendicular to @xmath30 , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the ohmic , hall and ambipolar diffusivities .",
    "the total electric field is @xmath43    the general expression of these diffusivities involve the abundance of all charged species @xcite , but in the absence of small charged grains , the diffusivities can be cast into a particularly simple form ) is written in gaussian units , for ease of comparison to standard expressions . ] : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the number density of hydrogen nuclei , @xmath46 and @xmath47 denote coefficients of momentum transfer for electron - neutral and ion - neutral collisions ( see @xcite ) , @xmath48 is the electron number density and @xmath49 is the ion mass density .",
    "we define @xmath50 as the ionization fraction . in this largely grain - free case",
    ", the ohmic resistivity describes collisions between electrons and neutrals , the hall term describes the electron - ion drift @xmath51 , and the ad term describes the ion - neutral drift @xmath52 .",
    "we further see that the strength of all three effects is inversely proportional to the ionization fraction @xmath50 , while their dependence on @xmath53 reveals that ohmic resistivity ( independent of @xmath54 ) dominates in dense regions with weak magnetic field , ad dominates in sparse regions with strong magnetic field , and the hall - dominated regime lies in between .    the importance of these non - ideal mhd effects in ppds can be characterized by defining an elsasser number for each term @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the alfvn velocity .",
    "the non - ideal mhd terms become dynamically important when any of these elsasser numbers become much smaller than @xmath57 , while the ideal mhd limit applies when they largely exceed 1 .",
    "note that @xmath58 is independent of magnetic field strength , and in the absence of small grains , it corresponds to the number of times a neutral molecule collides with the ions in a dynamical time ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "working with equation ( [ eq : diff0 ] ) for magnetic diffusivities , we can first define the hall frequency as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the gyro - frequency of the ions .",
    "therefore , the hall frequency is simply the ion gyro - frequency reduced by the level of ionization . with this definition , the hall elsasser number is simply given by @xmath62    the hall effect is not dissipative because the hall electric field @xmath63 is perpendicular to @xmath64 . instead of dissipation , the hall effect breaks the degeneracy between left and right polarized alfvn waves . the left - handed wave does not propagate beyond @xmath65 , while the right - handed wave ( the whistler wave ) has asymptotic dispersion relation @xmath66 at @xmath67 ( see appendix b and equation ( [ eq : whistlerdr2 ] ) ) .",
    "we see that the hall effect is important on timescales comparable to or shorter than @xmath68 , where the whistler wave physics comes into play .",
    "since the gas dynamics in ppds is characterized by dynamical timescale @xmath59 , the elsasser number characterizes the importance of the hall term well .    unlike ohmic resistivity and ad",
    ", the effect of the hall term depends on magnetic polarity . in the induction equation ( [ eq : induction ] ) ,",
    "if one reverses the magnetic field , the hall term does not change sign while all other terms do .",
    "hence , the hall term breaks the magnetic reversal symmetry which holds broadly in ideal / resistive / ad mhd , @xmath69 , where subscript ` @xmath70 ' denotes the horizontal component . without the hall term , the wind solution is also invariant under @xmath71 , @xmath69 . ] . in ppds",
    ", this means that the gas dynamics is expected to be different when the external magnetic field is aligned or anti - aligned with @xmath72 . for our choice , the aligned and anti - aligned cases correspond to background net vertical field @xmath73 and @xmath74 in shearing - box simulations .",
    "the focus of this paper is the inner region of ppds , where we expect the mri to be suppressed and a disk wind to launch .",
    "the two facts are closely related , and depend on the amount of external vertical magnetic flux threading the disk .",
    "this net vertical field @xmath75 is characterized by the parameter @xmath76 @xmath77 here we use subscript ` @xmath78 ' to specifically denote the background values .",
    "the plasma @xmath79 defined using total field strength can be much smaller .",
    "in the ideal mhd limit , the mri operates efficiently for @xmath80 , where stronger net field gives stronger turbulence @xcite . further increasing",
    "the net vertical flux would stabilize the mri , which is not expected to operate for @xmath81 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "non - ideal mhd effects modify the properties of the mri in different ways , as summarized in section [ sec : intro ] . in the inner region of ppds",
    "( @xmath11 au ) , it was found that the threshold for mri suppression switches to much weaker field @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "this is because of the excessively large resistivity around the disk midplane , and strong ad at the disk surface .    from local shearing - box simulations of the mri",
    ", it was found that the presence of net vertical magnetic field always leads to launching of a disk outflow ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the outflow is magnetocentrifugal in nature @xcite , but it is unclear whether it connects to a global magnetocentrifugal wind mainly because of the mri dynamo activities and symmetry issues @xcite .",
    "most recent global mri simulations are still inconclusive on the fate of such a disk outflow due to limited vertical domain size and other numerical issues @xcite .",
    "launching of a steady disk wind generally requires the presence of strong net vertical field with @xmath83 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which is also found to be the case from local steady state wind solutions that include all non - ideal mhd effects @xcite .",
    "however , these conditions are all derived by assuming constant magnetic diffusivities or constant elsasser numbers and the wind is essentially launched from the disk interior .",
    "more appropriately , launching of a disk wind only requires equipartition field at the wind launching region ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the inner region of ppds ,",
    "the disk interior is essentially decoupled from the magnetic field due to excessively large ohmic resistivity , therefore , wind launching is only possible from the disk surface layer where gas and magnetic fields are better coupled .",
    "since equipartition field at the low density disk surface corresponds to much larger @xmath76 , a steady wind can be naturally launched with @xmath84 @xcite .    in brief ,",
    "strong non - ideal mhd effects of ohmic resistivity and ad in the inner region of ppds makes the launching of steady disk winds much easier , and can be achieved with very weak net vertical field .",
    "this is closely related to the suppression of the mri discussed earlier since mri is the main source that prevents launching a steady wind .",
    "the wind solutions presented in this paper extend earlier wind solutions of @xcite and @xcite by including the hall term , and they share many common properties .",
    "the wind launching process is described in figure 6 and section 4.1 of @xcite .",
    "for the laminar wind solution , we can divide the disk vertical extent into a disk zone containing the disk midplane where the azimuthal gas velocity is sub - keplerian , and a wind zone at the disk surface where the azimuthal velocity is super - keplerian .",
    "the height at which this transition occurs , @xmath85 , is referred to as the base of the wind @xcite .",
    "the wind carries away disk angular momentum , the rate of which is determined by the @xmath86 component of the stress tensor @xmath87 at the base of the wind @xmath85 @xcite @xmath88 note that only the maxwell ( magnetic ) component is involved , because the reynolds ( hydrodynamic ) component is simply zero at @xmath85 by definition .",
    "the value of @xmath85 is typically found to be @xmath89 or higher in the inner disk .    the total rate of angular momentum loss from the disk is given by the difference of the above stress at the top and bottom of the disk , @xmath90 . since @xmath91 is constant throughout the disk , the desired symmetry for the wind to extract disk angular momentum is the even-@xmath24 symmetry , where @xmath92 hence the radial field bends to the same direction at the top and bottom of the disk .",
    "correspondingly , the rate of wind - driven accretion is given by @xmath93 where subscript @xmath94 represents accretion driven by vertical angular momentum transport , and in the latter estimate , we have adopted the mmsn disk model , with @xmath18 being disk radius normalized to au .    in numerical simulations containing both sides of the disk , it was found that the simulations sometimes generate solutions with odd-@xmath24 symmetry ( @xmath95 , @xmath96 ) , which is unphysical for a disk wind since it implies that the radial field at the top and bottom bending to opposite directions .",
    "this may be due to limitations of the shearing - box framework , where disk curvature is ignored , and hence there is no distinction between inward or outward radial directions .",
    "detailed discussions can be found in section 4.4 of @xcite , where it was found that with ohmic resistivity and ad included , a physical solution can be obtained and maintained by flipping the horizontal field at one side of the disk .",
    "however , the physical solution does not strictly obey the even-@xmath24 symmetry : the flip does not exactly take place at the disk midplane , but at some height above through a thin layer .",
    "this is because the midplane region is too resistive to conduct electric current , and only in the upper layer ( typically at @xmath97 ) can the flip take place where there is marginal coupling between gas and magnetic field .",
    "the thin layer carries a strong current , and receives the entire maxwell stress from the wind .",
    "correspondingly , it possesses large radial velocities and carries the entire accretion flow .    despite this issue with the symmetry of the wind solution",
    ", it was found that the solution in the wind zone , in particular , @xmath98 , is independent of such symmetry ( see section 4.4.1 of @xcite for details ) .",
    "this is mainly because @xmath85 is typically higher than the location where horizontal field flips .",
    "for this reason , if we are mainly interested in the properties of the disk wind , it suffices to enforce the even-@xmath24 symmetry by simulating half the disk ( @xmath99 ) with reflection boundary condition .",
    "besides vertical extraction of angular momentum via disk wind , angular momentum can be transported radially outward within the disk , characterized by the @xmath100 component of the stress tensor @xmath101 @xmath102 where the overline represents horizontal average .",
    "the shakura - sunyaev @xmath103 is obtained by vertically integrating @xmath101 across the disk zone @xmath104    assuming steady state accretion , the accretion rate resulting from radial angular momentum transport then reads @xmath105 where subscript ` @xmath106 ' represents accretion driven by radial angular momentum transport , and in the second equation we have adopted the mmsn disk model .    in the case of mri turbulence ,",
    "@xmath107 and @xmath108 are typically dominated by contributions from turbulence , while in mri inactive regions , substantial maxwell stress can be achieved due to large - scale magnetic field @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "such large - scale field corresponds to ordered horizontal magnetic field that winds up into spirals and transports angular momentum outward by means of _",
    "magnetic braking_. since we consider pure laminar wind solutions , radial transport of angular momentum is almost completely due to magnetic braking ( @xcite , and reynolds stress is typically negligible ) .",
    "we use athena , a higher - order godunov mhd code with constrained transport technique to enforce the divergence - free constraint on the magnetic field @xcite for all calculations presented in this paper .",
    "non - ideal mhd terms including ohmic resistivity @xcite , and ad @xcite have been developed for athena . in this work ,",
    "we have further implemented the hall term , with detailed algorithms described in appendix a , and code tests shown in appendix b. following the formulation in section [ ssec : formula ] , all our simulations are carried out using the shearing - box module with orbital advection @xcite .",
    "we use the hlld riemann solver @xcite with third order reconstruction .",
    "outflow vertical boundary condition is used , where gas density is extrapolated assuming hydrostatic equilibrium , zero - gradient is assumed for velocity and magnetic field except that @xmath110 in the ghost zones is set to zero if the flow is ingoing at the boundary .",
    "we also replenish disk mass to compensate for mass loss , although the mass loss is negligible over the duration of most simulations .",
    "we always adopt natural unit in the simulations with @xmath111 .",
    "all our simulations are quasi-1d along the disk vertical dimension to construct laminar wind solutions .",
    "they are quasi-1d because we use a three - dimensional ( 3d ) simulation box with only @xmath112 cells in the horizontal dimensions .",
    "the additional horizontal dimensions were found to be necessary for our time - dependent simulation to properly relax to the laminar wind configuration @xcite . for most of our runs ,",
    "the vertical domain covers half of the disk , extending from @xmath113 to @xmath114 .",
    "reflection boundary condition at @xmath113 is enforced to achieve the desired even-@xmath24 symmetry for physical wind solutions .",
    "we also perform a few simulations with full disk from @xmath115 to @xmath116 to address issues with symmetry and the strong current layer . in the vertical dimension",
    ", we use a resolution of 24 cells per @xmath117 , which we find to be sufficient to properly resolve the wind structure ( reducing this resolution by a factor of 2 yields essentially the same wind solution ) .",
    "the magnetic diffusivities @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath42 are obtained self - consistently in the simulations based on a pre - computed look - up table assuming equilibrium chemistry . for @xmath119 and @xmath42 , they are given in @xmath120 and @xmath121 which are independent of @xmath122 for the regimes we consider in this paper ( in the absence of abundant small grains ) . since we adopt the mmsn disk model with isothermal equation of state , the diffusivity table is two - dimensional providing the diffusivities as a function of density and ionization rate at fixed temperature .",
    "the ionization rate includes contributions from stellar x - ray , cosmic rays and radioactive decay , are expressed a function of column density to the disk surface ( see section 3.2 of @xcite ) , where fiducially we adopt x - ray luminosity of @xmath123 erg s@xmath9 and x - ray temperature of 5 kev .",
    "the procedure closely follows the description in @xcite , with some changes and updates described below .",
    "we have updated our chemical reaction network with the most recent version of the umist database @xcite .",
    "reactions are extracted using the same list of chemical species adopted in our previous works @xcite , which originated from the work of @xcite .",
    "the total number of gas - phase reactions increases from 2083 to 2147 .",
    "the grain - binding energy of all species are also updated to new values .",
    "we have tested the new chemical network and found that for a grain - free calculation , the new network gives ionization fractions that are typically slightly smaller compared with the previous version , but within a factor of @xmath124 .",
    "fiducially , we include a single population of dust grains with size @xmath125 m and abundance of @xmath126 in mass , which is the same as used in our earlier works @xcite .",
    "while this is by no means realistic , it provides reasonable and representative amount of total surface area to enhance recombination .",
    "it has been shown that the properties of wind solutions depend very weakly on the grain abundance @xcite , mainly because the wind is launched from disk upper layers where ionization fraction @xmath127 grain abundance .",
    "the disk surface layer is also exposed to far - uv ( fuv ) radiation which greatly enhances the level of ionization ( but is not captured in our diffusivity table ) so that the gas behaves in the ideal mhd regime . in our previous works @xcite",
    ", we obtained the diffusivities in the fuv layer separately by assuming constant ionization fraction of @xmath128 , and the fuv layer was assumed to have a penetration depth of @xmath129 g @xmath130 based on the work by @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , there is a sharp jump of diffusivities across the fuv ionization front ( see the lower left panel of figure 5 in @xcite ) .",
    "more self - consistent x - ray and uv radiative - transfer calculations ( e.g. , @xcite ) showed that the ionization fraction increases smoothly from midplane to surface .",
    "to avoid unrealistically sharp transitions , we empirically treat the fuv ionization as another independent ionization source , with ionization rate of @xmath131 the ionization is assumed to act on hydrogen and helium in the same way as x - ray and cosmic - rays so that we can simply use the diffusivity table by extending it to higher ionization rates .",
    "this assumption is by no means physical ( fuv ionization does not act on h or he ) , but it works for our purpose , because we simply need a prescription to allow the gas to behave in the ideal mhd regime in the fuv layer with a smooth transition .",
    "the detailed ionization structure in the fuv layer is unimportant . to further validate this choice , we have calculated the ionization profiles at 1 , 10 and 100 au based on the above ionization rate at the disk surface , and compared the results with the radiative transfer and chemistry calculations of @xcite with the same x - ray luminosity and temperature .",
    "we find reasonable agreement when @xmath132 g @xmath130 , which will be the standard value we adopt in this paper .    from our chemistry calculations , the magnetic diffusivities at the disk midplane can become excessively large , leading to extremely small timesteps from the courant condition .",
    "besides using super time - stepping to handle ohmic resistivity and ad ( see appendix a ) , we further set a diffusivity floor @xmath133 so that @xmath134 .",
    "if the floor value is reached , the values of @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath42 are reduced proportionally so as not to affect their relative importance .",
    "we have verified that this floor value is sufficiently large and the properties of our wind solutions are independent of @xmath135 is increased by @xmath136 . ] .",
    "our simulations mainly have two parameters , namely , the radial location in the disk @xmath21 , and the net vertical magnetic field @xmath137 characterized by @xmath76 .",
    "for each combination of the two parameters , we have three simulation runs .",
    "we begin by including only the ohmic resistivity and ad , running to @xmath138 where the system has fully settled into a laminar configuration .",

    "solutions including the hall effect ( r1b5h@xmath158 ) are shown in the left and right panels of figure [ fig : fiducial ] .",
    "we see that the main effect is that the horizontal magnetic field is strongly amplified when @xmath139 , while the field is largely reduced when @xmath149 .",
    "the amplification and reduction mainly result from the hall - dominated region at @xmath159 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath149 , the sign of @xmath160 reverses in the hall - dominated region so that it has the same sign as @xmath161 . in our time - dependent simulations , relaxation from the original solution r1b5h0 to the new solutions r1b5h@xmath158 is very rapid , as we see in figure [ fig : relax ] .",
    "the initial evolution of @xmath160 takes less than an orbit , with a few more orbits to fully relax to the final configuration .",
    "these features can be understood by looking at the induction equation . with the addition of the hall term",
    ", the immediate evolution of magnetic field follows @xmath162 @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the hall diffusivity based on vertical magnetic field , assumed to be constant to facilitate the analysis , and @xmath165 represents changes in @xmath160 to account for additional shear conversion of @xmath160 to @xmath166 .",
    "the first equation ( [ eq : hallshr1 ] ) describes the generation of radial field due to the hall effect .",
    "the underlying physics is best understood from the grain - free expression of @xmath119 in equation ( [ eq : diff0 ] ) : vertical gradient of toroidal field provides radial current @xmath167 , corresponding to radial drift of electrons relative to the ions . in the hall dominated regime , the ions",
    "are coupled to the neutrals @xmath168 , while magnetic field is frozen to the electrons .",
    "the second @xmath24-derivative then descries conversion of vertical field into radial fields due to vertical shear of electron motion .",
    "depending on the sign of @xmath137 ( hence @xmath169 ) , the result is that the original radial field can be amplified ( @xmath139 ) or reduced ( @xmath149 ) once the hall term is turned on , as we see in figure [ fig : fiducial ] .",
    "the second equation ( [ eq : hallshr2 ] ) provides positive feedback to field evolution due to shear . for @xmath139 ,",
    "shear conversion from @xmath165 amplifies the toroidal field ( and in general its second derivative ) , which promotes additional amplification of the radial field via ( [ eq : hallshr1 ] ) , leading to runaway .",
    "this is closely related to the hall - shear instability of @xcite , as also pointed out in @xcite .",
    "we see from figure [ fig : fiducial ] that the radial field @xmath160 is substantially stronger than the hall - free case throughout the disk interior .",
    "similarly , the toroidal field also becomes much stronger than the hall - free case .",
    "the field amplification process is eventually saturated due to damping by ohmic resistivity and ad , as well as advection of magnetic field by disk outflow .",
    "the opposite applies when @xmath149 .",
    "the hall effect and shear act destructively to the hall - free field configuration and both radial and toroidal magnetic fields are reduced .",
    "in particular , we see from the left panels of figure [ fig : fiducial ] that the radial field even changes sign around @xmath170 due to the hall effect , hence @xmath160 and @xmath161 have the same sign ( but small amplitude ) around this region , giving a negative maxwell stress .",
    "while shear conversion tends to reverse the sign of @xmath161 as well , this does not occur due to ad .      while we have enforced reflection symmetry across the disk midplane to guarantee that the wind solutions have physical geometry",
    ", it remains to clarify to what extent this assumption can be justified . in particular , in the case of @xmath139 , this treatment forces @xmath160 and @xmath161 to zero at the midplane , which works against magnetic field amplification . to this end , we perform a set of additional simulations containing the full disk with fiducial parameters ( 1au , @xmath151 with two polarities ) , named r1b5h@xmath144full .    in these simulations , we follow a similar procedure by starting with a hall - free run to @xmath138 , and then turn on the hall effect for the two polarities .",
    "the hall - free run saturates into the odd-@xmath24 symmetry solution ( unphysical for the wind ) , where the horizontal magnetic field maximizes at the midplane . after turning on the hall effect ,",
    "the same symmetry remains , which we run to time @xmath171 for full relaxation . at this time",
    ", we _ manually _ flip the horizontal magnetic field and velocity field at all cells with @xmath172 to achieve the physical even-@xmath24 symmetry .",
    "we then continue to run the simulations to @xmath173 and focus on how the system relaxes .",
    "we call these two continued runs r1b5h@xmath158full . for comparison",
    ", we also apply the flip to the hall - free simulation , which is named as r1b5h0full .        in figure",
    "[ fig : relax - full ] , we show the time evolution of the toroidal field profiles from these the runs after the flip ( we set @xmath174 at the time of flip ) . in the hall - free case",
    ", we see that the system maintains the even-@xmath24 symmetry state for a few orbits , while asymmetry slowly develops and the midplane toroidal field is gradually amplified with a single sign .",
    "nevertheless , the magnetic field configuration in the wind zone ( surface layer ) remains unchanged , and the system eventually relaxes to the physical wind solution with a strong current layer offset from disk midplane at @xmath175 , as highlighted in @xcite .      with the hall effect , and when @xmath139 , we see that the initial evolution of the system is similar to the hall - free case , but in 10 orbits , the midplane field gets rapidly amplified ( as a result of the hall - shear instability ) , and the horizontal field flips back to arrive at the odd-@xmath24 symmetry solution .",
    "there is a transient phase ( around @xmath176 ) where the field configuration remains physical for a disk wind and contains a strong current layer at @xmath177 , but the field amplification is so rapid that a unidirectional toroidal field quickly overwhelms and spreads into the entire disk .",
    "overall , it appears that with strong field amplification due to the hall - shear instability , the even-@xmath24 symmetry solution is difficult to be maintained in shearing - box without manually enforcing the symmetry at the midplane .",
    "in addition , achieving a physical wind solution with a strong current layer offset from the midplane appears difficult as well .",
    "this point was also raised in @xcite based on their simulations .",
    "the above fact poses serious concerns about the physical reality of the system at @xmath178 au : one either achieves the odd-@xmath24 symmetry solution with unphysical wind geometry , or achieves the more physical even-@xmath24 symmetry solution by unrealistically restricting the field geometry .",
    "this apparent dilemma may reflect the limitations of the shearing - box framework , and global simulations will be the key to resolving these issues . while we choose to restrict the symmetry in our simulations for most of this work , readers should bare in mind the potential caveats .",
    "when @xmath149 , on the other hand , we see from the bottom panel of figure [ fig : relax - full ] that the physical even-@xmath24 symmetry solution we obtained earlier easily survives in the full - disk simulation . the bottom panel of figure [ fig : symmetry ] further compares the full - disk solution with our previous solution with enforced reflection symmetry .",
    "the agreement is almost exact .",
    "therefore , we conclude that for the @xmath149 case , a wind solution with physical geometry exists naturally , where the horizontal field diminishes around the midplane region due to the hall effect and transitions through zero .",
    "in our full - disk simulations r1b5h@xmath158full after even-@xmath24 symmetry is enforced ( see section [ ssec : issue ] ) .",

    "we show the stability map for all the quasi-1d simulations we performed in the parameter exploration of @xmath18 and @xmath76 .",
    "compared with the hall - free situation of @xcite ( see his figure 7 ) , it is clear that when @xmath139 , the parameter space for stable wind solutions is considerably enlarged : stable solutions can be found with weaker vertical field and outer disk radii ; while if @xmath149 , the parameter space for stability is largely reduced : stable solutions can only be found with stronger vertical field and at smaller disk radii .",
    "the onset of the instability in the unstable runs is due to the mri , and the observed stability trend can be readily understood from the hall - mri linear dispersion relation .",
    "as discussed in section [ ssec : mriwind ] , the main reason for the existence of stable ( hall - free ) wind solutions is that the mri unstable modes under the given vertical field strength become too long to fit into the disk .",
    "the main role played by the hall effect is that , for @xmath139 , the unstable mri modes shift to smaller @xmath227 , or longer wavelength at fixed vertical field ( @xcite , and see figure [ fig : halldisp ] in the appendix ) .",
    "therefore , to make the system unstable , further weaker vertical field ( smaller @xmath228 ) is required .",
    "this explains why the parameter space for stability is enlarged when @xmath139 .    for @xmath149 ( or @xmath229 )",
    ", unstable mri modes exist only when @xmath230 . without dissipation ,",
    "the unstable modes essentially extends to infinitely small scales for @xmath231 @xcite . with dissipation , mostly ambipolar diffusion , the unstable modes cutoff at finite wavelength , yet still extend to scales smaller than the hall - free case .",
    "this can again be seen from figure [ fig : halldisp ] in the appendix by @xmath58 in that figure to see the trend . ] . since @xmath232 transitions from @xmath233 to @xmath234 from midplane to surface",
    ", it always falls in this range at certain height . at this location ,",
    "the unstable mri modes extend to shorter wavelength for fixed vertical field , making it more susceptible to the mri .",
    "indeed , when checking with figure [ fig : x31neg ] as well as many other unstable runs , we find that regions that first lead to instability ( at @xmath235 in figure [ fig : x31neg ] ) are typically associated with @xmath232 transition through order unity .",
    "the above discussions are also consistent with the analysis of the mri linear modes presented by @xcite .    connecting to the discussions at the end of the previous subsection ( [ ssec : vari ] )",
    ", we note that the range of stability can depend on other parameters such as grain abundance and x - ray ionization .",
    "it is conceivable that , for example , with enhanced x - ray ionization and reduced grain abundance , the range of radii where the laminar wind solution holds would shrink , at least in the case of @xmath149 .      toward outer disk radii ,",
    "external ionization penetrates deeper into the disk midplane .",
    "together with reduced gas density , this leads to rapid increase of the ionization fraction , making the disk midplane region better coupled to magnetic field .",
    "two consequences result .",
    "first , the wind is launched from a lower height compared with our fiducial runs , leading to higher mass outflow rate and wind stress ( in code units ) .",
    "this has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "second , with the hall effect , this makes magnetic field amplification more prominent in the @xmath139 case .    in figure [ fig:5aupos ]",
    ", we show the profiles of the elsasser numbers , the three magnetic field components , and the @xmath100 stresses from our runs r5b5h0 and r5b5h+ ( note that run r5b5h@xmath148 is mri unstable ) .",
    "we see that in the hall - free case , the radial field @xmath160 diminishes well before reaching the midplane . with the hall term , @xmath160 continues to increase toward the midplane until it catches up with the toroidal field @xmath161 before diminishing to zero at the midplane enforced by symmetry .",
    "the strongly enhanced @xmath160 combined with @xmath161 makes the maxwell stress @xmath189 more than @xmath236 times larger than the hall - free case .",
    "this example is an exaggerated version of the 1au fiducial runs discussed in detail in section [ ssec : relax ] .",
    "it is similar to the grain - free run discussed in section [ ssec : vari ] , and also other wind solutions at comparable or larger radii listed in table [ tab : runs2 ] are qualitatively similar .",
    "we also note that at radius @xmath237 au , the location of maximum inflow velocity @xmath196 is either very close or exactly at the disk midplane , indicating that entire disk is actively coupled to the magnetic field .    despite the stronger magnetic coupling in the midplane region ,",
    "the properties of the wind seem to be less affected , as we see that to the right of the vertical dash - dotted line in figure [ fig:5aupos ] , the magnetic profile , as well as the maxwell and reynolds stresses behave in a way very similar to the 1 au case .      in this subsection ,",
    "we follow the approach of @xcite and study the dependence of the wind - driven accretion rate on @xmath18 and @xmath76 .",
    "using all the data from table [ tab : runs2 ] , we fit the wind mass loss rate @xmath208 and the wind stress @xmath98 in the form of @xmath238 , where @xmath239 , @xmath240 and @xmath241 are constants .    for @xmath139 , there are a total of 15 data points , we find @xmath242    @xmath243    for @xmath149 , although there are only 5 data points , we find a very tight fit @xmath244    @xmath245    in the above two formulas , uncertainties to all fitting coefficients are found to be less than @xmath246 .",
    "the inclusion of surface density in these relations is based on the discussions in section [ sssec : sigma ] .    without the hall term ,",
    "the fitting results are very close to equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) of @xcite , thus we do not repeat . also note that we have quoted single - sided mass loss rate while @xcite used mass loss rate from both sides .    in figures [ fig",
    ": scaling ] , we show the values of the wind mass loss rate and the wind stress from all runs in table [ tab : runs2 ] together with the above formulas . we see that these formulas generally fit the data very well .",
    "the power law indices of the scaling relations are similar indicating similar wind physics .",
    "we have also checked the scalability of @xmath189 and find that while it has the trend to monotonically increase with increasing magnetic flux , the dependence on @xmath18 is not monotonic .    interpretation of these fitting formula follows from the discussions in section 3.2 of @xcite . with proper unit conversion , i.e. , equation ( [ eq : dotmv ] ) , the wind stress @xmath98 should provide reliable estimates of the wind - driven accretion rate . when applied to disks with surface density @xmath247",

    "the wind mass loss rate @xmath208 , on the other hand , is not well determined in the shearing - box framework @xcite .",
    "the normalization factors in the @xmath208 fitting formulas are likely significant overestimated , while power - law indices are probably more reliable , which at least sets the benchmark for shearing - box simulations .    using these fitting formulas and equation ( [ eq : dotmv ] ) assuming mmsn disk",
    ", we further show in figure [ fig : stability ] in dash - dotted lines the desired value of @xmath76 as a function of @xmath18 for the disk to maintain wind - driven accretion rate of @xmath225 and @xmath226 yr@xmath9 .",
    "we see that given the typical accretion rate of @xmath248 yr@xmath9 , stable wind solutions for disks with @xmath139 extend up to @xmath6 au , while for disks with @xmath149 , stable solutions exist only up to 3 - 5 au .",
    "reducing the accretion rate would lead to reduced radial range of stability .",
    "based on the fact that wind - driven accretion rate depends only on the physical strength of the net vertical field @xmath137 , we can further write down the wind - driven accretion rate in terms of the physical field strength @xmath249 for @xmath139 , and @xmath250 for @xmath149 .",
    "these expressions can be considered as disk - model independent , as long as a stable laminar - wind solution exists .",
    "the only mmsn scaling comes from the temperature profile , which is reasonable for irradiated disks .",
    "the above formulas are to be compared with the hall - free formula based on the results of @xcite @xmath251 these formulas again capsulate the role of the hall term on the properties of the laminar wind solutions . with similar scalings ,",
    "they reveal the enhancement and reduction on the strength of disk wind introduced by the hall term when @xmath139 or @xmath149 .",
    "our results indicate that @xmath252 mg net vertical magnetic field is necessary to achieve wind - driven accretion rate of @xmath248 yr@xmath9 at 1 au .",
    "stronger field is required for the @xmath149 case and weaker field for @xmath139 . for steady - state accretion ,",
    "the radial profile of @xmath137 should satisfy @xmath253 for both magnetic polarities , corresponding to magnetic flux distribution of @xmath254 , where @xmath255 denotes the total magnetic flux contained within radius @xmath21 .",
    "in this work , we have successfully implemented the hall term in the athena mhd code , which enables us to extend our previous study on the gas dynamics of protoplanetary disks ( ppds ) to include all three non - ideal mhd effects in a self - consistent manner in local shearing - box simulations .",
    "all our simulations include an external vertical magnetic field @xmath137 , which has been realized to be essential ( see discussions in section [ ssec : mriwind ] ) .",
    "we focus on the inner region of ppds ( up to @xmath256 au ) in this paper where the disk is expected to be largely laminar with accretion driven by a magnetocentrifugal wind .",
    "our first important finding is that including the hall term , the conclusion from our previous work ( @xcite where only ohmic resistivity and ambipolar diffusion were included ) that the inner disk is largely laminar still holds , with accretion mainly driven by a magnetocentrifugal wind . on the other hand , the wind solution is further controlled by the hall effect in a way that depends on the polarity of the external vertical field ( sign of @xmath137 ) , and we summarize as follows .    for external field being aligned with disk rotation ( @xmath139 ) , we find    * the horizontal magnetic field is strongly amplified compared with the hall - free solutions due to the hall - shear instability , leading to stronger disk wind and more efficient ( vertical ) angular momentum transport by up to @xmath3 . *",
    "the enhanced horizontal magnetic field drives radial transport of angular momentum via large - scale maxwell stress ( magnetic braking ) , which accounts for a considerable fraction of the wind - driven accretion rate . * the parameter space where a stable laminar wind solution can be found",
    "is extended . for typical accretion rates of @xmath248 yr@xmath9 , radial range of stability",
    "extends to @xmath256 au before the mri sets in .    for external field",

    "radial transport of angular momentum by magnetic braking is negligible . * the parameter space for a stable laminar wind solution",
    "is substantially reduced . for typical accretion rates of @xmath248 yr@xmath9 , radial range of stability",
    "extends only to @xmath258 au before the mri sets in .    for our fiducial simulation parameters ( 1au with @xmath151 )",
    ", we explored the dependence of the wind solutions on the disk surface density , x - ray ionization rate and grain abundance .",
    "our results indicate that the wind properties are largely determined by the physical strength of the vertical magnetic field .",
    "they are independent of the disk surface density and weakly dependent on the ionization structure ( e.g. , grain abundance , ionization rate ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the efficiency of magnetic braking strongly depends on the diffusivity profiles , and grain - free chemistry yields much higher @xmath189 than calculations with grains .    using the mmsn disk model , and using standard prescriptions of ionization and chemistry",
    ", we further explored the dependence of the wind properties on disk radii and the strength of the vertical magnetic field .",
    "the results are best summarized in the fitting formulas ( [ eq : fit1 ] ) to ( [ eq : fit4 ] )",
    ". we also provide disk model independent formulas for the wind - driven accretion rate in equations ( [ eq : mvpos ] ) and ( [ eq : mvneg ] ) .",
    "our results indicate that @xmath252 mg net vertical magnetic field at 1 au is required to account for the typical ppd accretion rates . at fixed accretion rate , stronger ( by a factor of @xmath259 ) net field",
    "is needed in the @xmath149 case .",
    "most of our simulations cover half of the disk with enforced reflection boundary condition at the disk midplane to guarantee that the wind solutions obey the even-@xmath24 symmetry ( horizontal magnetic field changes sign at midplane ) .",
    "we find that in the @xmath149 case , these solutions can always be realized when using a full disk thanks to the hall effect , which reduces horizontal field strength toward the disk midplane .",
    "when @xmath139 , however , we are currently unable to achieve the even-@xmath24 wind solutions in full - disk simulations at @xmath57 au .",
    "the system tends to end up at the odd-@xmath24 symmetry solution where the outflow geometry is unphysical for a disk wind .",
    "this solution gives stronger magnetic braking by a factor of up to a few since horizontal magnetic field is amplified throughout the midplane instead of passing through zero . while it is unclear which solution the nature picks due to limitations of the shearing - box framework , we do find that the even-@xmath24 symmetry wind solution can be realized at slightly larger disk radii ( @xmath258 au ) , which we will discuss in our companion paper .",
    "finally , the even-@xmath24 wind solutions obtained via simulations tend to have large radial drift velocities of magnetic flux , which is likely affected by vertical boundary conditions .",
    "global simulations are essential to resolve the symmetry issues and to yield realistic rate of magnetic flux transport .",
    "our work strengthens the notion that the evolution of ppds is largely governed by the distribution and transport of external poloidal magnetic flux , as suggested in our previous works @xcite .",
    "such large - scale field is expected as a natural consequence of star formation : molecular clouds and star - forming cores are all strongly magnetized ( e.g. , see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "recent dust polarization observations further reveal the presence of large - scale field threading protostellar cores .",
    "the large - scale fields appear to be randomly oriented with respect to the direction of protostellar outflows @xcite , while there is also evidence of preferential alignment for more isolated sources with projection effects taken into account @xcite . considering the hall effect",
    ", the bifurcation of disk wind properties with different polarities of the external magnetic field further suggests that ppds may evolve differently with different initial magnetic field polarities , and systems with @xmath260 may achieve higher accretion rate , or retain less magnetic flux ( in a self - organized way to avoid accreting to fast ) compared with systems with @xmath261 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the desired level of magnetic flux threading ppds ( at least in the class ii phase ) is tiny compared with the amount of magnetic flux threading star - forming cores .",
    "consequently , the process of star formation must also be accompanied by the removal of magnetic flux , which is another major problem in the theory of star formation .",
    "it appears that substantial magnetic flux must be removed in order to form the ppd itself to avoid the",
    " magnetic braking catastrophe \" @xcite , which may be achieved via misaligned magnetic field @xcite , external turbulence @xcite or non - ideal mhd effects @xcite .",
    "after disk formation , the transport of magnetic flux must be achieved within the disk itself , yet the problem is intrinsically global , and must depend on the overall magnetic field geometry and internal dissipation in the disk ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recently , there have been several semi - analytical works to study magnetic flux transport in thin accretion disks which have revealed complex dependence on the internal disk microphysics ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , a still missing important ingredient is the launching of magnetic outflow , and it appears that global simulations of ppds with resolved disk microphysics and sufficiently large vertical domain to accommodate disk outflow is essential toward a better understanding .    while our results suggest the inner region of ppds is largely laminar in terms of magnetic activities , it does not exclude the possibility for pure hydrodynamic mechanisms to generate turbulence .",
    "in fact , some level of turbulence is probably needed to keep at least some small dust suspended in the disk so as to explain the scattered starlight as well as the near infrared spectral energy distribution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "promising candidates of hydrodynamic turbulence may include the goldreich - schubert - fricke instability @xcite , the critical layer instability @xcite and the convective overstability and baroclinic vortex amplification @xcite .",
    "we note that the survival of these instabilities requires the suppression of mri ( e.g. , @xcite ) , hence the inner disk is a very promising location for them to operate , provided that appropriate thermodynamic conditions are met .",
    "a largely laminar inner disk is favorable for many processes of planet formation , including grain growth , planetesimal formation and further growth toward planetary embryos , which were discussed in @xcite .",
    "a largely - laminar disk may further alleviate the problem of type - i migration by allowing low - mass planets / cores to open gaps @xcite , which may substantially reduce the rate of inward migration .",
    "the polarity dependence of wind properties and the mri stability threshold might also indicate that planet formation and retention are dependent on the polarity of the initial large - scale field , although the details need to be filled up .    while our simulations have captured the most essential non - ideal mhd physics in the inner region of ppds , there are still several unresolved problems due to limitations of the shearing - box framework .",
    "important issues include the large - scale kinematics of the wind launched from the disk , wind geometry and symmetry , and the direction of magnetic flux transport .",
    "the next step forward would be to address these issues with global simulations , which are planned as our future work . in the companion paper",
