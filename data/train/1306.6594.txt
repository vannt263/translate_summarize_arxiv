    "<S> the bes data on the @xmath0 reaction show a clear enhancement in the @xmath1 mass distribution close to the threshold of this channel . </S>",
    "<S> such an enhancement is usually a signature of a @xmath2 resonance around threshold , which in this case would correspond to an @xmath3 state with quantum numbers @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> a state around @xmath5 results from the interaction of the @xmath6 using the local hidden gauge approach . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the peak observed in @xmath0 naturally comes from the creation of this @xmath3 state with mass and width around @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> a second analysis , model independent , corroborates the first result , confirming the relationship of the enhancement in the invariant mass spectrum with the @xmath3 resonance .    </S>",
    "<S> the decay @xmath0 was measured for the first time by the bes collaboration  @xcite with the aim of searching for the @xmath9 resonance through the decay @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> however , no clear enhancement in the @xmath1 mass distribution was found near @xmath11 gev . </S>",
    "<S> although unknown at the time of the experiment , it is easier to understand at present that the @xmath9 , now catalogued as @xmath12 in the pdg  @xcite , with quantum numbers @xmath13 , does not couple to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the resonance couples strongly to the @xmath14 @xcite , and it was found in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , using fadeev calculations and related methods , that it was made of a cluster of @xmath15 , with the @xmath16 highly correlated into an @xmath17 . on the other hand , since the @xmath18 and the @xmath19 mesons have quantum numbers @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , the decay @xmath0 constitutes the ideal reaction to look for an @xmath3 state , with quantum numbers @xmath22 , coupling to an @xmath23wave @xmath24 pair .    </S>",
    "<S> both on the theoretical and experimental sides , the study of @xmath3 states above @xmath25 gev is very scarce  @xcite . in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> this interaction generates resonances in different strangeness - isospin - spin channels . in the @xmath22 sector , a resonance was found with mass and width around @xmath28 and @xmath29 mev , respectively . this resonance is dynamically generated from the interaction of @xmath30 and @xmath31 . as shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , given its quantum numbers , it can not couple to other vector  vector or pseudoscalar  pseudoscalar channels , which makes its observation difficult . </S>",
    "<S> this state can not be clearly identified with any of the @xmath3 states listed in the pdg , and it is not found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( or , rather , it is pushed down to lower energy ) . </S>",
    "<S> reference  @xcite uses different dynamics , based on spin - flavour @xmath32 symmetry , and a regularization of the loops which is different from the one in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> both approaches share qualitatively many features , but differ somewhat in the numerical results . a different dynamical approach to the vector - vector interactions </S>",
    "<S> is provided in @xcite , using a massive yang - mills field theoretical framework . on the experimental side , in an analysis of @xmath33 annihilation channels done in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , an @xmath3 state with mass and width @xmath34 and @xmath35 mev is found , very far from the one predicted in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    on the other hand , a careful inspection of the bes results in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , shows an enhancement in the invariant mass spectrum of the @xmath1 around @xmath36 mev ( see more details from fig .  4 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , which might hint to a sizeable contribution from an @xmath3 state strongly coupling to the @xmath1 channel . however , as explained above , the search of the @xmath12 resonance was the main aim of ref .  </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , we shall make a first study of the role of the @xmath3 state ( which is dynamically generated by the @xmath30 and @xmath37 interaction ) in the @xmath0 decay . </S>",
    "<S> the decay mechanism is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ feydgm ] . </S>",
    "<S> let us denote by @xmath38 the bare production vertex for @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that this bare vertex is of a short range nature , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , just a coupling constant in the field theory language . to take into account the final state interaction of the @xmath6 pair ( which , in the end , will generate the @xmath3 resonance ) </S>",
    "<S> , one has to make the resummation of the diagrams shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ feydgm ] . </S>",
    "<S> let us also denote by @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( where @xmath41 is the @xmath6 invariant mass ) the full amplitude and the bare interaction vertex , respectively , of an @xmath42 @xmath6 pair . </S>",
    "<S> these are related by : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the loop function for the @xmath6 pair . </S>",
    "<S> this function is divergent , and it can be regularized both with a cutoff prescription or with dimensional regularization in terms of a subtraction constant  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we shall make use of the dimensional regularization scheme , which introduces a subtraction constant , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a regularization scale , taken here as @xmath47 ( notice that there is only one free parameter ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , since the @xmath30 and @xmath37 have large total decay widths , they should be taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> for that purpose , the @xmath48 function is the loop function for two stable particles of masses @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath51 , but convoluted in the masses @xmath49 and @xmath50 with the mass distribution of the two vectors , as done in refs .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution is considered in the range @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the nominal mass and width of the @xmath30 meson , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> explicit expressions for @xmath55 and @xmath48 can be found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    with all these definitions , </S>",
    "<S> the full amplitude @xmath56 for the process @xmath57 can be written , according to the diagrams in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ feydgm ] , as : @xmath58 where the last equality follows from eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> then we can easily get the @xmath59 invariant mass spectrum for the @xmath60 as @xcite : @xmath61 with @xmath62 a global constant factor ( that absorbs the unknown vertex @xmath38 ) which will be fitted to the data , and @xmath63 is the @xmath19 momentum in the @xmath18 rest frame , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the khlen or triangle function . in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath66 is the momentum of the @xmath67 in the @xmath59 center of mass system , but , as for the @xmath48 function , we must take into account the large width of the @xmath30 meson . </S>",
    "<S> that is , @xmath66 is the convolution with the mass distribution of the two @xmath67 ( in the range @xmath68 ) , of the momentum @xmath69 , given by : @xmath70    the @xmath1 invariant mass spectrum , eq .  , depends on the amplitude @xmath71 , and the most important ingredient in this amplitude is the @xmath72 transition potential @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> we will discuss two approaches to this potential in this work . in principle , this potential is fixed from the hidden gauge unitary approach of ref .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there , it was found that : @xmath73 where @xmath74 , being @xmath75 and @xmath76 the mass of the @xmath77 meson and the pion weak decay constant , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the term @xmath78 comes from the four vector contact term , whereas the term proportional to @xmath79 comes from the exchange of vector mesons . </S>",
    "<S> the constant @xmath79 is determined by the masses of the vector mesons ( @xmath77 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath30 ) and its value turns out to be @xmath82 . if one uses eq .   </S>",
    "<S> there are two free parameters for calculating the @xmath1 invariant mass spectrum of eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> one is the global constant @xmath62 , which does not influence the amplitude @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> the other one is the subtraction constant @xmath45 , that completely determines now the amplitude @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> this constant , in the absence of data and by similarity with other channels , was fixed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to @xmath83 , but this value does not allow to obtain a good reproduction of the bes data for the @xmath1 invariant mass spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> it produces a peak that is narrower and lower in mass than the bump seen in the data . instead </S>",
    "<S> , we find a good agreement with the data using the rather natural range @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> the second possibility is to consider a constant potential ( in contrast to the one in eq .  , which depends on @xmath85 ) , fitted to reproduce the data . </S>",
    "<S> a constant potential is acceptable here given the small range of @xmath41 considered in this work ( @xmath86 ) , and would render our analysis more model independent . by considering a constant potential , </S>",
    "<S> the subtraction constant @xmath45 is no longer a free parameter . </S>",
    "<S> this is so because it is an additive term in the @xmath48 function , and then any shift in this subtraction constant can be exactly absorbed in the constant potential , as can be seen in eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , we fix @xmath87 in this case ( the central value of the range used above ) . </S>",
    "<S> then , when using the constant potential , two free parameters need to be determined : the global constant @xmath62 , and the potential @xmath55 itself .    in both approaches , </S>",
    "<S> the free parameters are fitted by means of a @xmath88 function to reproduce the @xmath1 invariant mass spectrum data of the bes collaboration , shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dgdm ] . </S>",
    "<S> actually , the points in the latter represent the number of events once the sideband events are subtracted from the experimental points for the @xmath89 mass distribution given in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . , but the data for the mass distribution shown in fig .  4 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite are given without this subtraction . </S>",
    "<S> ] as a further constraint , we consider in the @xmath88 function the total number of events in the invariant mass range considered .     </S>",
    "<S> invariant mass spectrum of @xmath0 decay . </S>",
    "<S> the data points are taken from ref .  </S>",

    "<S> the different lines represent the output of eq .   </S>",
    "<S> for the different approaches considered in this work . </S>",
    "<S> the short - dashed line and the associated error band ( light blue ) represent the results of the constant potential . </S>",
    "<S> the ( red ) solid , long - dashed and dot - dashed lines represent the results for the potential in eq .   with @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the ( green ) dotted line , and the associated error band ( dark green ) is the prediction for phase space alone.[fig : dgdm],scaledwidth=49.0% ]    .values of some of the parameters used or determined in this work.[tab : params ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we start with the discussion of the second approach ( constant potential ) . </S>",
    "<S> the best fit values of the potential @xmath55 and the global constant @xmath62 are shown in table [ tab : params ] . the blue short - dashed line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dgdm ] represents the spectrum obtained with these parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the errors of the parameters as well as the error band of the curve are given by the condition @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the minimum @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting , by inspection of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dgdm ] , that the reproduction of the data is good . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath95 is rather small , given the large errors in the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that this approach is rather model independent , since we do not assume any underlying model for the transition potential @xmath55 , but take it to be a constant . </S>",
    "<S> we now consider the approach in which the potential is taken from the local hidden gauge theory , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> , for three different values of the subtraction constant , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dgdm ] with solid , long - dashed , and dot - dashed lines , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the fitted global constant for each case is shown in table  [ tab : params ] . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath95 is similar to that obtained with the constant potential and , inspecting fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dgdm ] , it is also clear that the reproduction of the data is also good .    </S>",
    "<S> both approaches ( constant and local hidden gauge potentials ) give results in good agreement with the data , and give hints for the presence of a resonance . </S>",
    "<S> yet , we would like to see if the experimental @xmath1 invariant mass spectrum in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dgdm ] can be accounted for by solely phase space . </S>",
    "<S> this is easily achieved by putting @xmath96 in eq .  , and adjusting @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> this turns out to be @xmath97 , and the fit has a larger @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> the dotted curve and the associated error band ( dark green band ) in fig .  [ fig : dgdm ] represent this result . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see that the inclusion of an @xmath3 state , generated dynamically from the @xmath24 interaction , is crucial to achieve a fairly good description of the bes data . </S>",
    "<S> the phase space alone clearly does not follow the trend of the data , even the corresponding @xmath98 could be statistically acceptable , which is due to the large errors of the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> but one observes that below @xmath99 almost every datum is above the phase space band , while they are mostly below for energies above that one .    </S>",
    "<S> , for @xmath72 , for the different approaches considered in this work . the notation of the lines as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dgdm].[fig : ts],scaledwidth=49.0% ]    now , we use the parameters obtained in the fits to see if the amplitude @xmath71 obtained by means of eq .   with both approaches </S>",
    "<S> has or has not a resonance . </S>",
    "<S> for this , we plot the modulus squared of the scattering amplitude of @xmath72 in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : ts ] . for the case in which the potential is taken as a constant , </S>",
    "<S> the peak is located roughly at @xmath100 , whereas its width is around @xmath101 . in the local hidden gauge potential case </S>",
    "<S> , we find instead @xmath102 and @xmath103 . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath71 matrix has a resonant shape , and the differences of about @xmath104 in the position of the peak can be accepted as systematic uncertainties of the resonance mass in our analysis . </S>",
    "<S> definitely , an experimental study with more statistics would help reduce these uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> note that , because of the large error bars in the data , the statistical error band ( shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ts ] for the constant potential ) is quite broad . </S>",
    "<S> however , this barely affects the position of the maximum , which moves by less than @xmath105 .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied the @xmath106 decay with the aim of determining the existence of an @xmath3 state through @xmath107 decay . in particular , by using a constant potential and a local hidden gauge potential for the @xmath108 transition </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the distributions of the differential decay width , with which we obtain the line shape of the @xmath1 invariant mass spectrum . by fitting our results to the bes experimental data , we find that these can be fairly described by including the contributions from an @xmath3 state , while the phase space alone can not describe the data , especially the bump structure near threshold . </S>",
    "<S> we also show the corresponding results for the modulus squared of the scattering amplitude of @xmath72 , from where we can get the mass and width of this @xmath3 state around @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the analysis done here shows clearly enough that the bes data , with the enhancement of the @xmath1 invariant mass spectrum close to the threshold , call for an @xmath3 resonance with the properties given by our fit . </S>",
    "<S> yet , the data could be considerably improved , and in view of the results of the present paper , it would be most advisable to do so , in order to improve on the present statistics , which would also revert into smaller systematic errors in the determination of the resonance properties . </S>"
