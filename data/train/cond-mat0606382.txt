    "condensed matter provides many phases with an energy gap between the ground state and the lowest excited state , and an exponential decay of one - particle correlations .",
    "well - known examples of gapped ( super)conducting or insulating phases are superconductivity , the quantum hall effect , the haldane gap in quasi - one dimensional ( quasi-1d ) spin @xmath1 antiferromagnets , charge and spin density waves .",
    "the coexistence between different orderings is usually difficult in bulk systems , but the progress in nanofabrication technology allows electron transport experiments in submicron hybrids made of several electrodes with different order parameters . of particular interest",
    "are typical mesoscopic experiments with charge density waves ( cdws ) @xcite , such as transport through constrictions @xcite , through nanowires @xcite , through an array of holes @xcite , through normal metal - charge density wave ( n - cdw ) point contacts @xcite , an aharonov - bohm effect experiment @xcite , and a scanning tunneling microscope experiment  @xcite .",
    "charge is transported below the superconducting gap by andreev reflection at a normal metal - superconductor ( n - s ) interface @xcite : a spin - up electron from the normal side is reflected as a hole in the spin - down band and a cooper pair is transmitted in the superconductor @xcite .",
    "andreev pair transport through a 1d metallic channel was realized recently in the form of the josephson effect through a carbon nanotube @xcite .",
    "the tunneling current through an insulator decays on the coherence length @xmath2 ( with @xmath3 the fermi velocity and @xmath4 the charge gap ) , much larger than the fermi wavelength @xmath5 .",
    "the dc - josephson effect through a 1d channel with translational symmetry breaking ( a cdw ) follows conventional tunneling according to the first approach to this problem by visscher and rejaei @xcite .",
    "coherent andreev pair propagation can even be mediated by the sliding motion of the cdw @xcite , suggesting that a mesoscopic cdw can be depinned by a supercurrent . on the other hand , bobkova and barash @xcite found recently an absence of andreev bound states at s - cdw - s interfaces .",
    "we develop here a microscopic description of andreev transport in s - cdw hybrids based on the hamiltonian approach , successfully applied in the recent years to superconducting structures such as for instance a superconducting point contact @xcite , ferromagnet - superconductor hybrids @xcite , and to non local transport through a superconductor @xcite .",
    "single particle evanescent states are localized within the cdw coherence length @xmath6 ( with @xmath7 the peierls gap ) , much larger than @xmath5 .",

    "the dephasing of a pair state in a cdw is obtained in the same framework of the hamiltonian approach as non local andreev reflection @xcite through a superconductor in n - s - n structures @xcite , a problem relevant to the realization @xcite of a source of correlated pairs of electrons .",
    "the two problems are indeed dual : the former is related to the propagation of an electron pair through a cdw with electron - hole pairing , and the later is related to the propagation in the electron - electron and electron - hole channels through a superconductor with electron - electron pairing .",
    "the mechanism for non local transport through a superconductor consists however of _ opposite currents _ in the electron - electron and electron - hole channels because of the opposite sign of the charge carriers .",
    "by contrast , the effect in a cdw is an equilibrium property , that we identify to the dephasing on @xmath5 of the evanescent pair state .",
    "the resulting absence of josephson effect through a cdw is robust , independent of the interface transparencies , as opposed to being restricted to tunnel interfaces in the superconducting case @xcite .",

    "[ sec : sol ] .",
    "phase coherent andreev reflection at normal metal - superconductor interfaces implies that the backscattered hole in the normal metal follows the same configure of impurities as the incoming electron , in such a way as the different paths followed by an andreev pair do not dephase with each other , except for finite energy effects controlled by the thouless energy , and for inelastic scattering .",
    "by contrast , we show that in a cdw , the random phase factors acquired by a spin - up electron visiting different impurities do not cancel with the phase of a spin - down hole visiting the same sequence of impurities , leading to dephasing of the andreev pair .",
    "the microscopic model discussed below in the ballistic system shows that dephasing occurs on the smallest length scale : the fermi wave length , ( up to a factor of two ) equal to the period of the cdw modulation .",
    "the dephasing of an andreev pair has its origin in the fact that the total number of spin - up electrons at position @xmath8 along the chain , given by @xmath9 is dephased by @xmath10 compared to the the total number of spin - down holes @xmath11 , because a maximum in the number of electrons corresponds to a minimum in the number of holes .",

    "( [ eq : hve ] ) and ( [ eq : hvh ] ) ) , resulting in a dephasing between the different paths following different sequences of impurities .",
    "as we show below by explicit calculations , the same conclusion holds for a ballistic multichannel system , where the phase factors have their origin in friedel oscillations .    a spin density wave ( sdw )",

    "the number of spin - down holes @xmath22 is equal to @xmath23 , the number of spin - up electrons .",
    "we conclude by the preceding argument that non magnetic impurity random phases of spin - up electrons and spin - down holes cancel with each other in the total phase of the andreev pair propagating through a sdw , so that a josephson effect over the coherence length is possible in a sdw .",
    "we provide now three different microscopic approaches to the absence of andreev pair transport through a ballistic cdw .",
