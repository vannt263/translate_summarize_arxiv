    "whenever the agenda is about wormholes exotic matter ( i.e. matter violating the energy conditions ) continues to occupy a major issue in general relativity @xcite .",
    "it is a fact that einstein s equations admit wormhole solutions that require such matter for its maintenance . in quantum theory",
    "temporary violation of energy conditions is permissible but in classical physics this can hardly be justified .",
    "one way to minimize such exotic matter , even if we can not ignore it completely , is to concentrate it on a thin - shell .",
    "this seemed feasible , because general relativity admits such thin - shell solutions and by employing these shells at the throat region may provide the necessary repulsion to support the wormhole against collapse .",
    "the ultimate aim of course , is to get rid of exotic matter completely , no matter how small . in the 4-dimensional",
    "( 4d ) general relativity with a cosmological term , however , such a dream never turned into reality .",
    "for this reason the next search should naturally cover extensions of general relativity to higher dimensions and with additional structures .",
    "one such possibility that received a great deal of attention in recent years , for a number of reasons , is the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) extension of general relativity @xcite . in the brane - world scenario",
    "our universe is modelled as a brane in a 5d bulk universe in which the higher order curvature terms , and therefore the gb gravity comes in naturally .",
    "einstein - gauss - bonnet ( egb ) gravity , with additional sources such as maxwell , yang - mills , dilaton etc .",
    "has already been investigated extensively in the literature @xcite . not to mention ,",
    "all these theories admit black hole , wormhole @xcite and other physically interesting solutions .",
    "as it is the usual trend in theoretical physics , each new parameter invokes new hopes and from that token , the gb parameter @xmath2 does the same .",
    "although the case @xmath3 has been exalted much more than the case @xmath4 in egb gravity so far @xcite ( and references cited therein ) , it turns out here in the stable , normal matter thin - shell wormholes that the latter comes first time to the fore .",
    "construction and maintenance of thin - shell wormholes has been the subject of a large literature , so that we shall provide only a brief review here . instead , one class @xcite that made use of non - exotic matter for its maintenance attracted our interest and we intend to analyze its stability in this paper .",
    "this is the 5d thin - shell solution of einstein - maxwell - gauss - bonnet ( emgb ) gravity , whose radius is identified with the minimum radius of the wormhole . for this purpose",
    "we employ radial , linear perturbations to cast the motion into a potential - well problem in the background . in doing this",
    ", a reasonable assumption employed routinely , which is adopted here also , is to relate pressure and energy density by a linear expression @xcite . for special choices of parameters",
    "we obtain islands of stability for such wormholes . to this end , we make use of numerical computation and plotting since the problem involves highly intricate functions for an analytical treatment .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the 5d emgb thin - shell wormhole formalism has been reviewed briefly .",
    "we perturb the wormhole through radial linear perturbation and cast the problem into a potential - well problem in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv we impose constraint conditions on parameters to determine possible stable regions through numerical analysis .",
    "the paper ends with conclusion which appears in sec .",
    "the action of emgb gravity in 5d ( without cosmological constant , i.e. @xmath5 ) is@xmath6 in which @xmath7 is related to the 5d newton constant and @xmath8 is the gb parameter . beside the maxwell lagrangian",
