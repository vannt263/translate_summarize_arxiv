    "the interior of the black hole is still an open problem in gravitational physics .",
    "although the singularity theorems @xcite predict the inevitable formation of the spacetime singularity due to the gravitational collapse to the black hole , the theorems are valid only if certain conditions hold within the classical framework .",
    "for example , the strong energy condition is assumed to prove the singularity theorems .",
    "this condition is given by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the ricci tensor and a nonspacelike vector , respectively . in de sitter spacetime , which is a vacuum solution of einstein equations with a positive cosmological constant , @xmath3 ,",
    "the strong energy condition is violated since @xmath4 for @xmath5 .",
    "however , the so - called weak energy condition holds in this spacetime .",
    "therefore , we could construct black holes without spacetime singularities , i.e. , regular black holes or nonsingular black holes , using spacetime with a positive cosmological constant .    in this study",
    ", we focus on regular black hole models containing a regular center inside the black hole event horizon @xcite .",
    "regular black holes of this type basically have causal structures similar to that of the reissner - nordstr \" om black hole but with regular centers instead of spacetime singularities @xcite . near the center , they behave like the de sitter spacetime . similarly to the de sitter spacetime , in these regular black holes , the weak energy condition is satisfied everywhere , but the strong energy condition is violated near the center .",
    "thus , these regular black hole models are outside the scope of the singularity theorems . in other words ,",
    "the spacetime singularity - free property of these regular black holes is not inconsistent with the singularity theorems .",
    "the models of the regular black hole we consider can be divided into two classes from the aspect of smoothness of their spacetime .",
    "the models belonging to one class are characterized by a smooth metric , which was first suggested by bardeen @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we call the regular black hole of this class the bardeen - type regular black hole .",
    "the solution is typically described by the gravitational field coupled to the nonlinear magnetic field @xcite .",
    "a magnetic monopole behaves like the positive cosmological constant so that the spacetime can become regular everywhere if there is a magnetic monopole inside the event horizon near the center of the solution .",
    "a key ingredient for the solutions of this class is the existence of fields acting as an effective positive cosmological constant inside the event horizon .",
    "this class of regular black hole solutions was generalized to the uncharged cases @xcite , charged case @xcite and rotating case @xcite .",
    "formation and evaporation of bardeen - type regular black holes were considered by hayward @xcite .",
    "quasinormal modes of bardeen - type regular black holes were investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the regular black hole model belonging to the other class is characterized by its spacetime composed of two distinct spacetimes : one is de sitter - like spacetime and the other is black hole spacetime , matched with a thin shell inside the event horizon .",
    "models of this class are motivated by the conjecture suggesting that the spacetime curvature has an upper limit of the order of the planck scale @xcite ; e.g. , the curvature invariant is restricted by @xmath6 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 being the riemann tensor and the planck length , respectively . according to this conjecture",
    ", the collapsing matter turns into a de sitter phase when the curvature reaches the upper limit . for the regular black hole model of this class ,",
    "as mentioned before , de sitter spacetime , whose curvature invariant is given by @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the de sitter horizon radius , is frequently considered as a regular core instead of a spacetime singularity .",
    "this conjecture suggests that the de sitter horizon radius @xmath10 for this model is of the order of the planck length @xcite .    in this study",
    ", we focus on the regular black hole of the second class . for the regular black hole solutions of this second class ,",
    "the uncharged @xcite and charged spherically symmetric solutions @xcite have been investigated .",
    "the radial stability of these solutions is studied and it is shown that some regular black hole solutions are stable against small radial disturbances @xcite .",
    "although many studies on the regular black hole of the second class have so far focused on spherically symmetric nonrotating cases , it is reasonable to generalize the regular black hole to rotating cases because astrophysical objects usually have angular momentum due to its conservation properties . in this study , therefore , we will extend previous analyses of spherically symmetric regular black holes to rotating cases , i.e. , cases of the rotating regular black hole of the second class .    as a first step , we focus on the slowly rotating case .",
    "rotational effects are then treated as small perturbations around spherical solutions .",
    "more specifically speaking , we consider the case of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the rotation parameter and mass of the black hole solution .",
    "the rotational effects up to the second order of @xmath14 are taken into account in this study because we are concerned with rotational effects on the matter properties of the thin shell like deformation of the shell .",
    "we assume the thin shell to be a timelike hypersurface as done in ref .",
    "in order for the timelike stationary thin shell to exist inside the event horizon , we need the inner horizon besides the event horizon because such a timelike stationary thin shell has to be inside the inner horizon .",
    "this implies that a charged black hole has to be considered as the solution outside the shell because a slowly rotating kerr black hole within the accuracy we assume has the event horizon only . in this study , therefore , we assume the charged regular black hole obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite to be the unperturbed spherically symmetric solution .",
    "we basically use a method of solution similar to that given by de la cruz and israel @xcite for matching between the kerr spacetime and the regular vacuum solution of einstein equations under the assumption of slow rotation .",
    "however , not only the spacetime but also the electromagnetic fields have to be considered in the present case because the thin shell is charged . outside and inside the shell ,",
    "we assume a slowly rotating kerr - newman solution and a stationarily and axisymmetrically perturbed de sitter solution , respectively .",
    "the perturbed quantities associated with the thin shell are derived from the junction conditions for the spacetime and electromagnetic field ( see , e.g. , refs .",

    "we show some numerical examples for the slowly rotating charged regular black holes .",

    "in order to obtain rotating regular black hole solutions , we match two different spacetimes by using a timelike thin shell . inside and outside the thin shell , stationary axisymmetric regular spacetime with a positive cosmological constant @xmath24 and the kerr - newman spacetime @xmath23 , respectively , are assumed in this study .",
    "the matching surface @xmath21 lies inside the inner horizon in @xmath23 and inside the de sitter horizon in @xmath24 as considered in ref .",
    "the effects of rotation are assumed to be sufficiently small that they can be treated as perturbations around a nonrotating spherically symmetric solution considered in ref .",

    "it is physically reasonable to expect that the rotation parameter of the black hole solution is of the same order as the angular velocities of the thin shell and frame dragging of the spacetime inside the thin shell .",
    "this expectation is justified when fully consistent solutions are obtained by the matching of two distinct spacetimes with a slowly rotating thin shell . in this study , we assume that rotating regular black hole solutions have equatorial symmetry and time - azimuth reflection symmetry because of the symmetry of the kerr - newman solution",

    "studies on rotating regular black holes with nonperturbative approaches are also interesting . in this study , we focus on the case of the perfect - fluid thin shell . however , the thin shell with anisotropic pressure might be more reasonable than the case of the perfect fluid , because the elemental field , like a scalar field naturally gives the stress energy tensor with the anisotropic pressure .",
