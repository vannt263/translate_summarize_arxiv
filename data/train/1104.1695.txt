    "a hidden - variable model is a theory making use of a set of parameters which complement or replace altogether the quantum mechanical state in the determination of the probability of experimental outcomes and which are distributed in such a way that the average observed frequencies reproduce the experimental results with an accuracy comparable to that of quantum mechanics . a hidden - variable model may be experimentally testable if it makes predictions different from quantum mechanics , or , in the case it reproduce quantum mechanics on average , if it provides a protocol to measure or fix the additional parameters , so that the experiments can access the conditional probability @xmath0 .    in the beginning ,",
    "the formulation of hidden - variable models was perhaps driven by the wish to find a more intuitive theory than quantum mechanics . in the present author",
    "s opinion , searching for a more fundamental theory is a worthy enterprise in itself , independently of whether it provide an intuitive account of the phenomena or not .",
    "indeed , it would be arrogant and shortsighted to think that quantum mechanics is the ultimate theory and that it will never be replaced . in this sense ,",
    "quantum mechanics is incomplete as any other physical theory and as our quest for understanding nature .",
    "the controversial paper by einstein , podolsky , and rosen @xcite argued that , assuming locality holds , quantum mechanics is an incomplete theory , according to some arbitrary criteria of reality and completeness formulated therein ( however , see refs .",
    "@xcite for criticisms ) . after bohm @xcite provided an example of a nonlocal theory which",
    ", by construction , reproduces quantum mechanics , the question of whether quantum mechanics could be reproduced or at least approximated by a local theory became relevant .",
    "the reformulation of the epr argument in terms of spin @xcite paved the way to the formulation of bell inequality @xcite .",
    "this inequality holds under the hypotheses that ( i ) hidden variables exist , ( ii ) locality holds , ( iii ) outcome independence is satisfied ( i.e. the conditional probability of observing an event @xmath1 for given values of the additional parameters and for given events at space - like separated regions is equal to the marginal probability for observing @xmath1 ) .",
    "bell proved that a judicious combination of the spin correlators @xmath2 obtained by varying the settings @xmath3 , which are given by the orientations @xmath4 and @xmath5 of two spin detectors , for a fixed preparation @xmath6 of a system , satisfies an inequality .",
    "this inequality is violated by experiments @xcite , which agree well with quantum mechanics .",
    "thus , one of the hypotheses ( i ) , ( ii ) , or ( iii ) must be false .    by the end of the 70s",
    "leggett worked out another inequality , which was only published a quarter of a century later @xcite . according to ref .",
    "@xcite the inequality applies to a class of nonlocal theories which satisfy determinism and outcome independence . as bell inequality ,",
    "leggett inequality is violated by quantum mechanics and , more importantly , disproved by experimental data @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the bonds on leggett inequality were improved @xcite .",
    "a criticism about the assumptions underlying leggett inequality and the significance of the experiments was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , but it failed to address the issue of locality .    here",
    "we prove that leggett inequality , even in the stricter formulation of ref .",
    "@xcite , actually applies to a family of _ local stochastic _ hidden - variable theories which do not necessarily satisfy the hypothesis of outcome independence .",
    "hence , the significance of the experimental violation of leggett inequality is to be reassessed : no rejection of the so - called `` nonlocal realism '' @xcite is supported by the experiments",
    ". however , the fact that the theories satisfying leggett inequality ( and thus excluded by the experiments ) do not require the hypothesis of outcome independence is of great relevance , since we can thus exclude a class of local theories not contained in the class satisfying bell inequality , which was already ruled out by experiment @xcite .",
    "let us analyse the hypotheses at the basis of leggett inequality . ref .",
    "@xcite assumes a set of deterministic hidden variables formed by two unit vectors and additional parameters , so that    * hypothesis ( a ) : * @xmath7 represents the hidden variables . the observable joint probability of observing outcomes @xmath8 and @xmath9 in a epr - bohm experiment can then be written @xmath10 with @xmath11 an invariant measure of the hidden variables and @xmath12 the probability of obtaining @xmath8 and @xmath9 for fixed @xmath13 .    * hypothesis ( b ) ( locality of the distribution ) : * the probability distribution for the parameters is assumed to be independent of the settings of the detectors and to factorize as @xmath14 .",
    "let us call @xmath15 the domain of @xmath16 for given values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "* hypothesis ( c ) ( determinism ) : * for given @xmath13 , the outcome of either measurement is predictable with certainty , i.e. , there exist two functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 such that @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in other words ,",
    "the joint probability @xmath12 takes the value one in a subdomain @xmath23 and zero in the complementary subdomain .",
    "* hypothesis ( c@xmath24 ) ( outcome independence ) : * if the outcome of one measurement is known , the outcome of the other is not influenced .",
    "this further hypothesis is unnecessary if hypothesis ( c ) is made , since it is actually a consequence of determinism : @xmath13 carries all the relevant information to determine the outcome of a measurement , hence any additional information , like the outcome of another measurement , is redundant . in terms of probabilities , hypothesis ( c@xmath24 ) implies that @xmath25 if hypothesis ( c ) is assumed , eq .",
    "can be restated equivalently saying that @xmath26 , where @xmath27 represents the subdomain of @xmath15 in which @xmath28 and @xmath29 is defined analogously .",
    "however , both hypotheses ( c ) and ( c ) will be shown later on to be unnecessary .",
    "* hypothesis ( d ) ( compliance with malus s law ) : * the marginal probability of observing the outcome @xmath8 for fixed @xmath30 should satisfy ( we use the formalism for spin , not for polarization of light ) @xmath31    we remark that locality was not assumed for the probabilities @xmath32 and @xmath33 , since each of them can depend on the setting of the remote detector .",
    "however , a local ( i.e. independent of the detector settings ) distribution @xmath34 for the hidden variables was assumed .",
    "thus it seems that locality and nonlocality hypotheses are made at the same time .",
    "however , we notice that the nonlocality depends on the level of the description . in terms of the variables @xmath17 and @xmath18 the theory is local , since the marginal probabilities are by hypothesis ( d ) independent of the setting of the far - away detector , and by hypothesis ( b ) the distribution of @xmath17 and @xmath18 is independent of the settings of the detectors .",
    "in the preceding section , we exposed the hypotheses made in ref .",
    "now , we formulate an alternative , less restrictive set of hypotheses , and we show that leggett inequality follows from them .",
    "they are as follows :    * hypothesis 1 : * the hidden variables are formed by two unit vectors @xmath17 and @xmath18 , such that the observable joint probability of obtaining outcomes @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the left and right arm of an epr - bohm setup is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is an invariant measure , which in a given coordinate system @xmath37 takes the form @xmath38 .",
    "hypothesis 1 does not mean that there can not be any more hidden variables , but that after integrating out all of them , except @xmath17 and @xmath18 , eq .   holds .",
    "* hypothesis 2 ( locality ) : * ( a ) the measure @xmath36 is local ( i.e. independent of the detectors ) @xmath39 and ( b ) the marginal probability of obtaining outcome @xmath8 on one arm does not depend on the setting of the detector in the other arm , namely @xmath40    * hypothesis 3 ( compliance with malus s law ) : * identical to hypothesis ( d ) above .    no more hypotheses are needed .",
    "if there are additional hidden variables @xmath16 no assumption is needed about the form of the probability @xmath41 nor about the distribution @xmath42 , provided that hypothesis 2 and 3 are satisfied .",
    "in particular , the hypothesis of outcome independence is unnecessary , contrary to what happens in the derivation of bell inequality .",
    "here we rederive the inequality following refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the detectors are characterized by two unit vectors @xmath43 . as stated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the following equality holds for any two variables taking values @xmath44 @xmath45 after multiplying eq .   by the probability @xmath46",
    ", we sum over @xmath8 and @xmath9 and we exploit the well known inequality @xmath47 , so that we have , after applying hypothesis 3 , @xmath48 with the correlator @xmath49 . upon averaging eq .",
    "gives @xmath50 with @xmath51 the spin correlator .. in this case @xmath52 would not be the correlator , but simply the spin - spin average .",
    "however , @xmath53 would already contradict existing experiments . ] from here on , the derivation of the inequality is identical as that presented in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite and we reproduce it in the appendix , where we evidentiate some fine points in the derivation .",
    "a cartoonish depiction of the current situation for hidden - variable models .",
    "theories satisfying leggett ( i.e. hypotheses ( 1)-(3 ) given by us ) or bell hypotheses are a subclass of all the possible local theories .",
    "they have a nonzero intersection represented by the checkered area .",
    "both subclasses are ruled out by experiment .",
    "there is left a subclass of local theories which do not comply with neither leggett or bell hypotheses , and thus may violate both inequalities .",
    "this is a necessary , but not sufficient , condition to reproduce the current experimental evidence.,width=316 ]    in conclusion , we have demonstrated that the experimental violation of the leggett inequality rules out an important class of stochastic local theories , identified by hypotheses ( 1)-(3 ) , rather than deterministic nonlocal theories , identified by hypotheses ( a)-(d ) . thus the claims that `` nonlocal realism '' was disproved were shown to be unfounded . on the other hand , the models ruled out by the experiments do not necessarily obey the property of outcome independence .",
    "this hypothesis is needed in addition to locality in order to derive the bell inequality . in the derivation of leggett inequality , this hypothesis is replaced by the requirement that a kind of malus s law applies to the hidden variables .",
    "thus the class of models excluded by the violation of leggett inequality is not contained in the class excluded by the violaton of bell inequality .",
    "the union of these classes , however , does not exhaust all the possible local hidden - variable theories . in a forthcoming paper @xcite , the present author will discuss a class of local models that do not satisfy neither the outcome independence or the compliance with malus s law hypothesis .",
    "these models will be shown to violate both bell and leggett inequalities .",

    "equation is our starting point .",
    "let us study the term @xmath54 the value of the function inside the absolute value is independent of the choice of coordinate system , so its functional dependence on the coordinates must change with the coordinate system .",
    "the same is true for the function @xmath55 . in ref .",
    "@xcite a fixed coordinate system was used , so that the functional dependence of @xmath55 on its parameters is given .",
    "we indicate this fixed function in spherical coordinates as @xmath56 .",
    "it is also assumed that @xmath57 and @xmath58 , i.e. the polarizations of the detectors vary in the @xmath59 plane of the fixed coordinate system .",
    "we call @xmath60 the unit vector along the @xmath61 axis in the coordinate system @xmath37 .",
    "the vectors @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be written as @xmath62 and @xmath63 , with @xmath64 $ ] and @xmath65 $ ] the angles with the fixed @xmath61 axis . after defining @xmath66 and @xmath67 ,",
    "it is immediate to check that eq .",
    "can be rewritten @xmath68 with @xmath69 and @xmath70 defined by @xmath71 by averaging eq .   over the possible values of @xmath72 ,",
    "i.e. rotating @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the fixed @xmath59 plane while keeping their relative direction unchanged , we obtain @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 since @xmath76 depends only on @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , it is convenient to change variables to @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the two inner integrals in eq .",
    "then become @xmath82 after defining the marginal distribution @xmath83 eq .",
    "can be rewritten @xmath84 with @xmath85 thus , the correlator satisfies @xmath86 by letting the angle between @xmath4 and @xmath5 vary while keeping both vectors in the @xmath59 plane , and summing the inequalities , it can be proved , following ref .",
    "@xcite , that @xmath87 with @xmath88 and @xmath89 another marginal distribution .",
    "now there is a subtle point to be made : after rewriting @xmath90 , eq .   can be cast in invariant form , so that @xmath91 now , if we consider another unit vector @xmath92 and let @xmath4 and @xmath5 vary in the plane orthogonal to @xmath92 , letting the angle between them take the same values @xmath93 and @xmath94 , the inequality reads @xmath95 by summing eqs . and , and",
