    "in recent years , methods of statistical mechanics are applied in other fields of research based on mapping the quantities under study to physical or numerical quantities , e.g. spins or binary numbers `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' , from which various measures can be calculated and analysed @xcite .",
    "such is the case in the recent investigations on the statistical properties of dna sequences and human languages @xcite , as well as music @xcite .",
    "the observation that local grammar - like rules affect the global statistical nature of sequences is in accordance with the philosophy of statistical mechanics .",
    "an interesting issue concerns the distribution of semantic units `` words '' ; words in a languange and the 64 triplets ( 3-tuples ) in genetic sequences .",
    "the frequency of the occurence of each semantic unit is calculated , and the units are ordered in a the decreasing order of frequency , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the size of the vocabulary . for languages",
    ", there was a so - called zipf s law that @xmath2 with @xmath3 @xcite . in dna sequences ,",
    "triplets in coding regions are the `` words '' , since the coding regions are transcribed to rna , where the nonoverlapping triplets code the amino acids .",
    "it is unknown whether there are `` words '' in noncoding regions .",
    "recently , distributions of n - tuples ( @xmath4 ranges from @xmath5 to @xmath6 ) were analysed and it was claimed that zipf s law holds and that @xmath7 is consistently larger for the noncoding sequences than coding sequences and therefore the former are more similar to languages @xcite .",
    "this conclusion was heavily criticized @xcite .",
    "in fact , though it was appealing due to the earlier attempts to relate it to the structure of language @xcite , zipf s law had been acknowledged as `` linguistic shallowness '' since it can be generated from random text @xcite@xcite@xcite , it was claimed recently that an initial inverse power law in the distribution can be obtained under quite general conditions @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it was pointed out that @xmath8 is , in fact , a increasing function of @xmath9 , there is no macroscopic regime where @xmath7 is a constant , consequently any attempt to fit the data with a single @xmath7 is sensitive to the details of the fitting @xcite .    for the occurrence of letters over the alphabet in biological sequences as well as in over 100 human languages , it was claimed that the ordering of frequencies approximates @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are constants , the normalization condition reduces the independent parameter to only one .",
    "an exception was found to be chinese , where the corresponding distribution is nearer to zipf s law .",
    "this can be understood ; there is no letter in chinese unless it is transformed to the alphabetic system according to the pronounciation , while the character , which had been considered to be the letter since it is the basic unit , also embeds meanings .",
    "the characterization and explanation of the distributions demands a model beyond the zipf s law . a 2-parameter random markov process ( mp )",
    "was proposed for the generation of these sequences @xcite , with the observations mentioned above being natural consequences .",
    "can the distributions of 3-tuples in various different genetic sequences be well described by the mp model ?",
    "the positive answer is given by showing that the distributions for each sequence that is long enough can be fitted very well by a mp with certain parameters , while the features for short sequence are consequences of finite markov chain .",
    "but no relevance with taxonomy or coding / nocoding issue is clearly observed .",
    "the mp model is explained in sec .",
    "ii ; the analysis on genetic sequences is reported in sec .",
    "iii ; sec .",
    "iv contains the conclusions .",
    "a markov process is the simplest algorithm for the stochastic production of sequences .",
    "consider the generation of a sequence composed of `` words '' or states chosen from @xmath1 possibilities .",
    "if the probability distribution for choosing the next `` word '' is only a function of the current last one , then this process can be considered as a mp . the transition probability from state @xmath13 to @xmath14",
    "is denoted as @xmath15 .",
    "there is the normalization condition @xmath16 .",
    "the probability of occurrence of each `` word '' in the sequence which is long enough is the stationary solution of mp .",
    "the ingredients of this model are as follows :    \\(a ) number of states . for simplicity , @xmath1 is fixed to be equal to @xmath17 with @xmath18 an integer , each state is identified by an @xmath18-bit binary number between @xmath19 and @xmath20 . for the genetic sequences , @xmath21 and thus @xmath22 .",
    "\\(b ) sparseness of @xmath23 . reflecting the grammatical rule ,",
    "the transition matrix @xmath15 is assumed to be sparse , i.e. the number of nonvanishing elements in each row , @xmath24 , is finite and does not scale with @xmath1 .",
    "the simplest nontrivial case is @xmath25 .",
    "\\(c ) permissible connectivity .",
    "the cornerstone of the discussed mp is that the transition matrix differs from a random graph . in a language , for instance",
    ", the semantic and grammatical rules require that a word is not haphazardly followed by a random selection of other words .",
    "rather , the choice of the successive word is strongly constrained .",
    "this fact is modeled in the following manner .",
    "the two states @xmath26 and @xmath27 connected to the state @xmath28 are given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "in words , the @xmath31 rightmost bits of state @xmath28 are shifted one bit to the left , and the rightmost bit is set equal to either @xmath19 or @xmath32 .",
    "thus each successive word is closely related to the one before , the outword and inword connectivity of each state is equal to @xmath33 .",
    "\\(d ) strength of transition probabilities .",
    "the two weights , transition probabilities , going from each state take the value @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "\\(e ) bias .",
    "another parameter , the bias , is introduced to distinguish the two options .",
    "we pick @xmath36 and @xmath37 with probability @xmath38 , and vice versa with probability @xmath39 .",
    "the bias can be thought to be related to some global constraints by the `` meaning '' of the text in addition to those reflected by the local rules .",
    "when @xmath40 , i.e. there is no bias , this mp was found @xcite to lead to a distribution approximating log - normal rule , eq .",
    "( [ log ] ) , which is held quite well by the distribution of letters .",
    "this can be understood through the fact that the sequence of letters is only restricted by local phonetic preferences .    because of global inversion symmetries @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the interesting regime in the unit square of @xmath43 may only be @xmath44 . furthermore , changing only @xmath34 to @xmath35 , or @xmath38 to @xmath39 is only changing the role between @xmath19 and @xmath32 .",
    "an important variable is the average drift towards 1 , @xmath45 .",
    "it was found that a function obtained by rescaling the local slope of the distribution function only depends on @xmath46 in addition to the rank order @xcite . for @xmath47",
    ", we have @xmath48 independent of @xmath38 .",
    "another interesting quantity is the markov entropy @xmath49 which is independent of @xmath38 .",
    "the feature of this type of mp model have been found to be robust for many modifications .",
    "for example , the qualitative feature does not change if dependence of the next state on more former states than the current last is introduced , or higher but still finite connectivities are allowed .",
    "it was also found that all the distributions resulting from these extended models could be readily mapped to the simplest one @xcite .",
    "therefore this two - parameter model can serve as a prototypical model even for less sparse matrix , which might possess many parameters .",
    "genetic sequences of different taxonomic divisions are randomly selected from genbank release no .",
    "97 @xcite .",
    "first , for short sequences there are , of course , many plateaus in the ordered distribution of triples , and can not be fitted by the stationary solutions of the mp process .",
    "this is a finite - size effect and just a support for the validity of this model . as an example , compare the ordered distributions for bacteriophage p1 gene10 with 1127 bp as shown in figure [ finite ] ( a ) with the ordered distribution generated by a mp with @xmath50 , @xmath51 after @xmath52 steps as shown in figure [ finite ] ( b ) .",
    "we analysed in detail 22 long sequences : the longest one being s. cerevisiae chrosome iii complete dna sequence with 315341 bp ; the shortest one comprises 6061 bp ; 6 sequences are complete dna genome - s ; 5 are complete cds - s , i.e. , sequences coding for amino acids in protein ; 3 rna sequences , 2 of them are complete genome .",
    "different sequences are listed and numbered in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "we fit the data of the distributions in terms of that generated by the mp model . for each sequence ,",
    "the distribution of triplets is calculated and ordered in decreasing order .",
    "then the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath38 are found for the best fitting mp with the least value of the cost function defined as @xmath53 where @xmath54 @xmath55 is the rank - ordered distribution of triplets for a genetic sequence , @xmath56 is the rank - ordered distribution of @xmath57bit binary numbers for a mp . in the two dimensional lattice parameter space @xmath58 with lattice constant @xmath59 , we search for the mp which fits each sequence with minimal cost",
    ". three examples of the distribution and its fitting to mp are shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "it can be seen that the fitting is quite good .",
    "such is the case for 16 sequences . for the remaining 6",
    ", there is a discontinuous decrease at a high rank @xmath60 or @xmath61 .",
    "this discontinuity at the tail might be due to fluctuations and does not affect our general discussions .",
    "a satisfactory fitting can be found eliminating the last several points .",
    "see figure [ fig3 ] for an illustration .",
    "note that our fitting is global instead of being part of the data , i.e. , the contributions to the cost function do not come mainly from the tail , as shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "the quantitative results are summarized in table 2 for all the sequences we analyzed .",
    "we present the values of the cost , @xmath34 and @xmath38 . from @xmath34 and @xmath38",
    "we calculate @xmath46 and the markov entropy @xmath62 of the corresponding markov process , and the shannon entropy @xmath63 calculated directly from the original data of each sequence . for a completely random sequence , @xmath64 , thus @xmath65 .",
    "it is clear that the costs are very small ; the largest one is @xmath66 while the least is @xmath67 .",
    "the average and variance of the results over _ all _ sequences are presented in table [ tab3 ] , in addition , the average of costs is @xmath68 .",
    "it is remarkable that the relative variance , i.e. variance divided by the average for each quantity , is not large . in particular , that for @xmath46 is only @xmath69 , implicating that @xmath46 is a very special quantity , while that for @xmath70 , which is model - irrelevant , is only @xmath71 .",
    "the relative variances for @xmath34 , @xmath38 and @xmath62 are either not large , though larger than those for @xmath70 and @xmath46 . it can be seen that the statistics are different but not far from each other , and that most sequences ocuppy a small region in the parameter space , which is distinct but not very far from the complete randomness with @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .    a problem is whether there is a distinction in quantities discussed here between coding and noncoding sequences . to examine this possibility",
    ", we calculate the average values over sequences no .",
    "these sequences are complete coding sequences or rna .",
    "both are @xmath76 coding .",
    "comparing table [ tab4 ] with table [ tab3 ] , it can be seen that @xmath34 is larger than the average over all sequences , and @xmath62 and @xmath70 are smaller , clearly in contrast to the claim that noncoding regions are more similar to languages than coding regions @xcite .",
    "but the difference is so small that no definite conclusion can be drawn . on the other hand ,",
    "the differences with those of the language are still very large , since values of @xmath34 and @xmath38 were found both to be @xmath77 @xcite , a very large value .",
    "similar investigations are made on whether there is relevance between the quantities characterizing sequences and the different taxonomic divisons .",
    "we calculate the averages and variances for each division , as listed in table [ tab5 ] .",
    "it can be seen that there is no monotonic trend with the evolution . to examine whether sequences in the same division are closer to each other compared with all sequences",
    ", we compare the overall variances in table [ tab3 ] and the variances for viral and primate in table [ tab5 ] , since for other divisions only one or two sequences are analysed .",
    "it can be seen that some are larger while some are smaller than those for all the sequences .",
    "therefore , in our result there is no sign of relevance between these quantities and taxonomy .",
    "the distribution of triplets remains nearly unchanged if the starting nucleotide shifts @xmath32 or @xmath33 behind .",
    "this can be seen from figure [ shift ] showing the distributions for the original s. cerevisiae chrosome iii complete dna sequence , and those shifted @xmath32 and @xmath33 behind .",
    "this result holds for all sequences .",
    "\\(1 ) statistics of examined genetic sequences are well described by the 2-parameter markov process .",
    "\\(2 ) most sequences gather in a small region in the parameter @xmath43 space .",
    "the entropy @xmath70 of the data and @xmath46 measured in the mp model are very near to each other for different sequences .",
    "more biologically relevant information might be exposed when the distribution and transition matrix are analysed according to the real triplets instead of to the rank order . in this way",
    ", the transition matrix varies from sequence to sequence , determined by the different biochemical enviornments .",
    "this trend in modern statistical mechanics seems to be consistent with some ancient philosophy . in an ancient chinese philosophy book _ yi jing ( principle of change ) _ written about 3000 years ago , there is a symbolic system called `` eightfold diagrams '' consisting of symbols stacked by @xmath78 broken or whole lines representing respectively two opposite elements `` yin '' ( - ) and `` yang '' ( + ) . it was claimed that everything can be explained by mapping to this system .",
    "it is amusing to note that the number of symbols is @xmath79 , the same as the number of triplets in genetic sequences .",
    "maybe this is not accidental from the viewpoint of information carriers .",
