    "we have investigated magneto - transport under microwave irradiation in a @xmath9 2deg with density @xmath10 , mobility @xmath11 corresponding to transport time @xmath12 . the hall bar with a 100 @xmath13 wide channel",
    "was patterned using wet etching ( see fig .",

    "a micro - bonding wire was positioned on the hall bar chip , parallel to the current channel at a distance of @xmath14 from the nearest edge .",
    "one of the extremities of the wire was connected to a coaxial cable , which allowed to send microwave irradiation in a broad frequency range from @xmath15 ghz to @xmath16 ghz .",
    "the sample was cooled in a he@xmath17 insert to a temperature of around @xmath18 mk .",
    "we compared the effect of microwaves on the magnetoresistance at two different frequencies @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "as shown , on fig .  1 , the high frequency irradiation leads to microwave induced resistance oscillations ( miro ) similar to those reported in @xcite .",
    "the magnetoresistance under irradiation is characterized by a series of peaks and dips as a function of magnetic field whose position are determined by the ratio @xmath1 of the microwave frequency @xmath2 to the cyclotron frequency @xmath3 . at higher microwave power",
    "these oscillations are expected to develop into zrs , however in our experiments this regime was out of reach due to the limited cooling power of the he@xmath17 insert .",
    "the magnetoresistance under high frequency microwave irradiation @xmath21 contrasts sharply with the behavior under irradiation at @xmath20 . in the latter case",
    "the magnetoresistance does not exhibit oscillations anymore but presents a significant drop under irradiation in a large range of magnetic fields ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "this drop can not be explained by an increase in electron temperature since resistance increases with temperature in the explored range of magnetic fields .     and",
    "the high frequency irradiation induces oscillations in the magnetoresistance ( miro ) , whereas the low frequency driving leads to an homogeneous drop in @xmath0 for @xmath23 . , width=302 ]    it is difficult to explain these effects of low frequency irradiation with a purely bulk mechanism .",
    "for a frequency @xmath20 and a typical magnetic field of @xmath24 , we find @xmath25 . in this adiabatic limit",
    ", the microwave field can not give rise to transitions between landau levels , thus neither elastic nor inelastic zrs theories can justify a strong drop in resistance of around 50% .",
    "the only expected effect is that of a weak heating leading to a thermal broadening of the landau levels .",
    "moreover for @xmath26 the electric field penetrates the sample in the form of plasmon excitations . at frequencies",
    "@xmath27 bulk - magnetoplasmons excitation are evanescent thus we expect the excitation field to be screened in the bulk of the sample @xcite . on the contrary edge magneto - plasmon excitations are gapless and appear even at frequencies @xmath4 which may lead to an enhancement of the microwave field near the edges of the sample . as a consequence",
    "the effect of irradiation should be confined to the sample edges .",
    "this and recent results from @xcite lead us to develop a model explaining the observed drop of resistance through the dynamics of orbits skipping along the sample edge under adiabatic microwave fields .",
    "we first use the landauer formula to make a connection between the four terminal resistance @xmath0 and the drift velocities of the skipping orbits along sample edges .",
    "this formula relates @xmath0 to the transmission @xmath28 of the channels propagating along sample edges : @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the number of occupied landau levels ; @xmath31 at @xmath32 @xcite . for this magnetic field ,",
    "the typical transmission @xmath33 is very close to unity ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "since @xmath30 is high in our experiments , we can make a semi - classical approximation for the transmissions : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the distance between voltage probes , @xmath37 is the group velocity of the channel which is given by the drift velocity in the semiclassical limit .",
    "here @xmath38 is the typical time after which an electron from channel @xmath39 is scattered into the sample bulk ( @xmath38 is however longer than @xmath40 because the probability of scattering back to the edge is high after a collision on an impurity @xcite ) ; this yields @xmath41 this expression shows that orbits with low drift velocity give the main contribution to @xmath0 .",
    "we thus start by investigating the effects of microwave irradiation on a typical channel propagating along the edge with a drift velocity @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the fermi velocity ( a typical trajectory is shown on fig .  2 ) .",
    "the relation eq .",
    "( [ landauer ] ) allows us to compute the resistance @xmath0 from the knowledge of the drift velocities under irradiation .",
    "this avoids the direct computation of the transmissions from a classical billiard model @xcite which is numerically more expensive .",
    "the polarization of the field is chosen along the @xmath44 axis , perpendicular to the edge of the sample .",
    "this choice is related to the experimental geometry where the ac field was created by modulating the potential of a thin wire that was oriented parallel to the sample edge .",

    "we will now show that this enhancement of drift velocity under irradiation is actually a general feature of edge transport and derive a simple analytical estimation for the increase in drift velocity .",
    "our theoretical analysis is based on the conservation of the action @xmath49 under adiabatic driving , which reflects the absence of transitions between landau levels in the limit @xmath4 . in absence of irradiation the drift velocity @xmath47",

    "@xmath100 the resistance of the sample is enhanced under irradiation , this is consistent with a heating of the sample since in the explored temperature range the resistance increases with temperature .",
    "interestingly , the data represented on fig .

    "if this potential represents inhomogeneities in the 2deg ( or smooth anharmonic components of the disorder potential ) , the case of parallel polarization must be considered as well . in this case",
    "an exact analytic treatment becomes difficult , because the dynamics can not be reduced to a one dimensional hamiltonian anymore . at an heuristic level one can argue , that a parallel electric field @xmath175 will modulate the position of orbit centers by @xmath176 which",

    "we are dealing with the adiabatic limit @xmath182 , where photon - absorption is strongly suppressed , we believe that the explanation proposed there can not be applied to the present case .",
    "in conclusion we report a strong suppression of longitudinal resistance under low frequency microwave irradiation in a high mobility two dimensional electron gas .",
    "this effect occurs in the regime where the irradiation energy @xmath183 is much smaller than the spacing between landau levels @xmath184 and does not induce interlevel transitions .",
    "we explain our results through the enhancement of the mean drift velocity along sample edges by a low frequency electric field .",
    "the theoretical analysis of this enhancement leads to a scaling relation between resistance , power and magnetic field which is confirmed experimentally .",
    "the adiabatic theory for the hard wall case is developed in detail in section ii , and extended in section iii to the case general case of a soft confinement potential .",

    "such a confinement potential can also appear due to inhomogeneities in the 2deg , and smooth components of the disorder potential .",
    "it is therefore possible that our results could be explained by an enhancement of the mean drift velocity in the bulk .",
    "we emphasize however that bulk magnetoplasmon modes are absent for @xmath27 and we expect the ac electric field to be stronger around the edges where edge magnetoplasmon modes are present . as a consequence",
