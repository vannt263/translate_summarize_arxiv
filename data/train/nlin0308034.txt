    "@xcite one example where these two factors play a crucial role is in the experimental observations of distinctive spiral wave dynamics on the surfaces of spherical beads , which are excitable inhomogeneous chemical media @xcite .",
    "a biological example is the origin of abnormal cardiac rhythms in the human heart which depend on the anatomical substrate .",
    "the heart possesses a complex nonplanar geometry with multiple chambers , with holes corresponding to valves and blood vessels .",
    "some serious arrhythmias are associated with circulating spiral waves similar to those observed in chemical media @xcite . since",
    "an abnormal anatomical substrate is a common finding in patients with some types of cardiac arrhythmias , and interventions that modify the anatomy are an accepted form of therapy @xcite , theoretical analyses of the interplay between geometry of the substrate and dynamics may help in the therapy of cardiac arrhythmias .",
    "in this paper we study spiral wave dynamics on ( punctured ) spheres with spatially inhomogeneous excitability .",
    "we show for punctured spheres that the sum of indices which characterize each spiral has to be zero .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate that topological constraints imposed by the spherical geometry and inhomogeneity in excitability lead to the formation of pairs of spirals , with distinctive transient dynamics or as stable attractors , in which one spiral acts as a source and a second as a sink leading to a source - sink pair under a broad range of conditions .",
    "our results explain the experimental observations of spirals on spherical beads @xcite . while we do not consider detailed models of cardiac wave propagation",
    ", our results may apply to some generic aspects of atrial arrhythmias because the thin walls of the atria can be described as two - dimensional ( 2d ) inhomogeneous excitable media with specific geometrical features .",
    "the mathematical description of spiral waves is based on the notion of phase which in turn allows one to characterize spiral waves by an index . from this description ,",
    "a number of topological results placing restrictions on spiral wave dynamics can be derived .",
    "@xcite    with the exception of a finite number of singular points , with each point in an orientable and compact two - dimensional differentiable manifold @xmath0 we identify a unique phase lying on the unit circle , @xmath1 . the resulting phase map or phase field",
    "is assumed to be continuously differentiable , except at the singular points .",
    "the manifold can be triangulated @xcite ( subdividing it into a set of polygons ) , where none of the edges or vertices of the polygons pass through a singularity .",
    "the index , @xmath2 ( sometimes also called the topological charge or winding number ) of a curve @xmath3 bounding a polygon is found by computing the line integral @xmath4 where the polygon is always traversed in a clockwise orientation . by continuity of @xmath5 , @xmath2 must be an integer .",
    "the index of a singular point is uniquely defined as the index of any curve @xmath3 provided that @xmath3 encircles the point but no other singular points .",
    "the index of a curve that does not enclose any singular points is obviously zero .",
    "if the manifold @xmath0 has no boundaries , each edge of the triangulation is an edge of two polygons .",
    "since the line integral adds up the change in phase along the various edges of the polygon , the sum of the indices of the singular points for a phase field in @xmath0 is @xmath6 where the sum is over all the singular points .",
    "this follows since the contribution of the change in phase of each edge to the total integral is counted twice , but since the edge is traversed in opposite directions each time , the net contribution of each edge is zero .",
    "this index theorem is applicable to tori , and other surfaces of genus different from 0 .",
    "however , unlike the more familiar poincar index theorem ( see ref .",
    "@xcite p. 74 for vector fields )",
    "the sum of the indices of the singular points does not depend on the genus of the surface .",
    "this index theorem for manifolds without boundaries can be extended to manifolds with boundaries . in the following",
    ", we will consider the case of structures that arise from puncturing orientable and compact two - dimensional differentiable manifolds .",
    "the index of a hole can be uniquely defined as the index of a curve @xmath3 provided that @xmath3 encircles the hole but no other holes or singular points and @xmath3 is positively oriented with respect to the domain which contains the hole and is bounded by @xmath3 . applying this definition and taking the summation in eq .",
    "( [ indextheorem ] ) over the singularities and the hole , or the holes if there is more than one hole , the index theorem can be proven by the same line of arguments as for the case of manifolds without boundaries .",
    "this extension is important in the heart , for example , where the atrium is punctured by valves and veins . in such cases one",
    "is led to consider manifolds with holes ; for example , a sphere with a hole .",
    "a sphere with a hole is topologically equivalent to a disk , and , indeed , the results for disks and for spheres with holes are consistent : for the disk @xmath7 , bounded by a curve @xmath3 , @xmath8 so that the sum of the indices of the singular points in the disk is equal to the index of the curve @xmath3 bounding the disk .",
    "if there is a single singular point on the disk , with an index of + 1 , the index of the curve bounding the disk will also be + 1 .",
    "imagine now the boundary of the disk to be brought together ( like a draw - string bag ) so that the boundary of the disk now defines a hole in the sphere .",
    "in this geometry the curve @xmath3 will be traversed in an opposite orientation ( the hole is now inside @xmath3 ) from the direction it was traversed when it was the boundary of the disk .",
    "now if there is a singular point with an index of + 1 on the sphere , the index of the hole is -1 , so that the sum of the indices is again zero .",
    "since it is necessary to conserve the sum of the indices , singularities of index @xmath9 usually arise and are destroyed in pairs of opposite sign @xcite .",
    "an exception occurs when singularities are destroyed by collision into a boundary , so that the index of the singular point and the index of the boundary both change simultaneously .",
    "another exception occurs if there are singularities with index different from one . in such cases interactions between different singularities",
    "can lead to destruction or creation of odd numbers of singularities @xcite .",
    "the fitzhugh - nagumo ( fhn ) equation , @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are two scalar fields , @xmath13 is the ratio of the time scales associated with the two fields , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the constant diffusion coefficients , is a prototypical model for excitable media .",

    "the radii are large enough to avoid a curvature - dependent loss of excitability @xcite , and the shell is sufficiently thin that the dynamics is effectively 2d corresponding to the dynamics on a sphere .",
    "@xcite the initial condition is a domain of  excited \" state , adjacent to a domain of the  refractory \" state .",
    "both domains have the forms of slices of the same size oriented from the north to the south pole @xcite and yield a pair of counter - rotating spirals .    in order to apply the topological results to the fhn equation ,",

    "are obviously associated with a singular point which is called the spiral core . in",
    "what follows , we assume that there are only single - armed spirals so that a clockwise rotating source has an index of + 1 , and a counterclockwise rotating source has index -1 .",

    "a non - zero index of a hole implies that wave fronts travel permanently around the hole such that the numbers of fronts travelling clockwise and counterclockwise are different .",

    "the spiral with the higher frequency assumes control of the dynamics @xcite on the sphere .",
    "the location on the sphere , where wave fronts emanating from the two spiral cores annihilate , moves toward the core of the low - frequency spiral . finally , the low - frequency spiral core is pushed farther from the high - frequency spiral core @xcite(see fig .",

    "[ beta ] and [ d ] . viewed from the low excitability end of the sphere , the waves wind into a small region about the core , reminiscent of the structure of antispirals , i.e. , inward moving spirals seen in oscillatory media @xcite",
    ". however , the origin of this inward spiral motion in oscillatory media differs and is distinct from that observed here . in oscillatory media , either spirals or antispirals are stable depending on system parameters and the wave length diverges on the border in the parameter space between these two regimes .",
    "thus , antispirals exist independently of spirals .",
    "this is not the case here because the generation of an inward moving spiral relies on the presence of a spiral source and spherical geometry . for example , consider the fhn system with a disc geometry and a radial gradient in excitability such that the maximum value of @xmath19 is located in the center of the disc . in this case , a source - sink pair can not occur because the high - frequency spiral , acting as a source , would push the other ( low - frequency ) spiral out of the system , excluding the presence of any strong random inhomogeneities in excitability which may pin the low - frequency spiral and prevent its motion ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ anti_series ] shows that remnants of the low frequency spiral persist in a small area around the core .",
    "it has been speculated that antispiral waves might occur in cardiac tissue @xcite .",
    "while excitable media can not support a regime of exclusive antispirals due to their excitable character , our results show that source - sink pairs with similar characteristics could form in the heart where the underlying dynamics is excitable , the medium is inhomogeneous and the topology is similar to a ( punctured ) sphere .",
    "spiral dynamics of the type described above has been observed by maselko and showalter @xcite in experiments on the excitable belouzov - zhabotinsky reaction on spherical beads .",
    "they attributed the generation of spiral source - sink pairs to inhomogeneities in the medium related to differing chemical environments .",
    "this is consistent with our findings for systems with gradients and is further confirmed by the work reported in ref .",
    "while the generation of source - sink pairs due to a gradient in the fhn medium investigated here is only an intermediate state ( but one that persists for approximately 240 spiral periods in our simulations ) , random spatial variations of the excitability with a correlation length comparable to the diameter of the spiral core meander or larger can lead to a final state consisting of such a source - sink pair @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the source can be trapped in a region of depressed local excitability .",

    "not only does the gradient in the fhn medium change the local excitability but it also induces a drift of the spiral cores @xcite . for our model , the drift is rather slow compared to the transition to the source - sink pair which takes place during the transient regime t. this can be seen in fig .",
    "( the fluctuations in @xmath49 are due to spiral meandering . ) in regime i , the dominating spiral drifts toward lower excitability and its wave fronts continuously push the other core in the opposite direction , thus , keeping the distance @xmath55 between the cores approximately constant ( see fig .",
    "the fluctuations in @xmath54 are again due to meandering of the spiral cores . because of this drift",
    ", the local excitabilities at the two spiral cores approach each other until they become equal .    at this point , regime ii in figs .",
    "[ beta ] and [ d ] is entered .",
    "the dynamics change drastically : the slaved spiral reverses its drift direction and regains control over its own dynamics .",

    "neither the _ average _ distance between the spirals nor the _ average _ local excitability changes further .",
    "yet , on top of the persisting unsynchronized meandering of the two spiral cores , the bound pair slowly moves along a ( closed ) equi-@xmath19 curve on the surface of the sphere .",
    "the direction of the motion depends on the initial condition , i.e. , whether the spiral with positive index was initially closer to the point of lowest excitability or to the point of highest excitability than the spiral with negative index .",
    "the wave dynamics generated by this bound pair is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ beta ] .",
    "while kinematic theory applies only to spirals with large cores , it is instructive to note that this theory predicts that the direction of the drift due to gradients depends on the model system and its parameters @xcite .",
    "although our simulations have shown the same direction of the drift for a range of parameters in the meander region of the fhn phase diagram , it is conceivable that , under different circumstances favoring a drift toward higher excitability , one spiral could act as a permanent source and a source - sink pair could be the final attractor .",
    "such a scenario would also be consistent with the experimental findings in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "next , we consider a homogeneously excitable sphere with a single hole .",
    "two scenarios can be observed depending on the location of the hole with respect to the spiral pair .",
    "if a spiral wave is not permanently attached to the hole , the dynamics is very similar to the case without any hole .",
    "if one of the spirals is permanently attached to the hole , the frequency of this spiral is lowered .",
    "the size of the hole determines the frequency of the spiral because the wave front has to travel around the hole .",
    "the transient dynamics is similar to that in regime t for the case with a gradient ; however , no drift of the spiral cores is induced and the final state is a spiral source - sink pair as shown in fig .",
    "[ series_hole ] . not only is the net index conserved during the transition to a spiral source - sink pair but so is the index of the individual spirals : during the transition an outgoing counterclockwise ( clockwise ) oriented spiral is converted into an ingoing clockwise ( counterclockwise ) oriented spiral .",
    "thus , the formation of spiral source - sink pairs conforms with the topological constraints .",
    "if a gradient as well as a hole is present , the spiral drift discussed earlier also determines the final state , which depends on the hole s location in the gradient field .",
    "for instance , if the point of lowest excitability in the medium is on the hole boundary , simulations show that the spiral which is not attached to the hole will stabilize close to this point . in this",
    "final state odd numbers of wavefronts are attached to the hole , again conserving the topological charge of the hole .",
