    "the number of electrons from charm over that from bottom is one of the most important parameters .",
    "a fixed - order - plus - next - to - leading - log  ( fonll ) perturbative qcd calculation predicts electrons from bottom will dominate these from charm above 4  gev/@xmath9  @xcite .",

    "thus , experimental determination of this ratio is a key issue .",
    "phenix has measured the ratio of the number of electron from charm over that from bottom via partial reconstruction of d@xmath2@xmath3e@xmath4 k@xmath5 @xmath6 decay in p+p collisions at @xmath10  gev . unlike charge sign pairs of electrons with @xmath11  gev/@xmath9 and hadrons with @xmath12  gev/@xmath9 were reconstructed as partial reconstruction of d@xmath2@xmath3e@xmath4 k@xmath5 @xmath6 decay .",
    "kaon identification for hadrons was not performed for high statistics . like charge sign pairs of electrons and hadrons",
    "were used for background subtraction . since charge asymmetry of electrons and hadrons",
    "was only produced by weak decay , combinatorial background and contributions from photonic electrons were canceled out completely . most of contribution from jet was also canceled out , since jet was basically charge independent .",
    "figure  [ fig1a ] shows raw invariant mass distribution of electrons and hadrons .",
    "n@xmath13 was defined as the number of unlike sign pair  ( n@xmath14 ) minus the number of like sign pair  ( n@xmath15 ) in the mass range from 0.4 to 1.9  gev/@xmath16 .",

    "these contributions were taken into account by pythia .",
    "since dominant component of @xmath22 was daughters of semi - leptonic decay of heavy flavored hadrons and cross sections of heavy flavors in pythia did not have any contribution for @xmath22 , uncertainty of @xmath22 from pythia was reduced at this method .",
