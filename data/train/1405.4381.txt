    "we have all seen a waterwheel ( fig . [ fig1 ] ) and have an intuitive feel for how it works .",
    "consider now an atom in a solid .",
    "normally we think of atoms as executing small - amplitude thermal vibrations about their equilibrium positions .",
    "that is , we think of them as oscillators . in one dimension",
    "an oscillator can only go back and forth .",
    "but in 2d or 3d it could run around a circle , provided its natural frequencies along two independent directions are equal .",
    "can then the flow of _ electrical current _ somehow be gauged to drive an atom around , in a manner akin to a waterwheel ?",
    "schematic of a waterwheel . ]",
    "according to an argument by sorbello @xcite this should be possible . when an atom - or more precisely an atomic nucleus - is immersed in a current , incident electrons get scattered .",
    "there is a transfer of momentum between the flow and the target , and a resultant force .",
    "this force is called the _ electron wind force_. for an isolated scatterer in a free - electron metal it is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the scattering cross section of the target , here is the so - called transport cross section . ]",
    "@xmath2 is the fermi momentum of the electrons and @xmath3 is the incident electron particle current density",
    ".    therefore if we design a closed path that goes through regions of different current density , the net work done by this force need not be zero .",
    "one such path is shown in fig .",
    ". then the wind force is _ non - conservative _ , with the capacity to continually pump energy into the nuclear motion by driving the nuclei around closed paths in configuration space .",
    "a scatterer in an electron current .",
    "when the scatterer is inside the metal wire , the current density exerts a force on it - the electron wind force .",
    "outside , there is no force .",
    "thus , the wind force does non - zero net work around the closed path shown , and can _ drive _ the atom around . ]",
    "this possibility began to attract attention in the context of atomic and molecular wires about 10 years ago @xcite , initially with arguments that appeared at odds with each other @xcite , the full resolution of which still requires further work @xcite .",
    "after several years of further consideration the non - conservative character of forces on atoms in nanowires was demonstrated microscopically , culminating in the design ( through simulation ) of a single - atom `` waterwheel '' @xcite .",
    "the idea was soon extended to waterwheels in abstract spaces spanned by generalized cooperative displacements @xcite .",
    "these prospects raise a number of questions . leaving aside the idea of atomic - scale motors",
    ", non - conservative forces can have practical repercussions for the _ stability _ of atomic wires .",
    "electromigration is a class of phenomena @xcite in which electrical current drives atomic diffusion and rearrangements resulting in the mechanical failure of a conductor .",
    "electromigration is traditionally thought of as a thermally - assisted process .",
    "but kinetic energy gain into `` waterwheel '' atomic motion under non - conservative forces could be an alternative activation mechanism , and potentially a much more powerful one .",
    "these problems are being investigated by a growing number of researchers @xcite with further questions being uncovered all the time .",
    "however , the physical - and to an extent mathematical - understanding of forces due to current remains a challenging subject , for a simple reason . a real waterwheel is driven by a classical flow .",
    "but in the atomic case it is the quantum electron fluid doing it , and the rotors themselves ( the nuclear subsystem ) have to - or may have to - be considered quantum - mechanically , at least for some aspects of the full problem",
    ".    force on the other hand is fundamentally a classical notion .",
    "combining these partly but not wholly intuitive elements into a physical yet rigorous understanding requires careful considerations .",
    "the above works have derived and discussed forces under current from a variety of standpoints .",
    "they are fundamentally connected but vary in technical difficulty and physical flavour .",
    "the aim of the present discussion is to obtain these forces in a simple way which at the same time retains the essential ingredients needed to capture the principal _ types _ of forces - there are five - along with a picture of the physics behind them .",
    "the methods involved should be accessible to physics undergraduates and postgraduates in the physical sciences .",
    "the forces we are considering are fundamentally forces on atomic nuclei , or possibly ions .",
    "nevertheless we will occasionally speak of atoms and atomic motion , to help visualize the problem .",

    "@xmath14 is the electron - oscillator coupling , and will be treated as a perturbation . for",
    "the moment the oscillators could represent generalized degrees of freedom , such as unperturbed vibrational normal modes , or individual nuclear degrees of freedom viewed as einstein oscillators .",
    "the construction of the coupling @xmath15 from scratch is a difficult - and to an extent open - problem .",
    "the systems of interest are infinite , aperiodic and open , with a continuum of electronic states .",
    "in addition , interatomic forces under current contain the key non - conservative component highlighted already .",
    "these factors require a reconsideration of the usual born - oppenheimer separation @xcite .",
    "a possible physical picture of the _ unperturbed _ dynamics is to imagine that nuclei vibrate on a chosen known potential - energy surface ( such as the ground - state born - oppenheimer surface ) , while electrons remain in a current - carrying steady state for each geometry .",
    "one can then make a small - amplitude expansion in nuclear displacements about a chosen configuration .",
    "a natural choice of expansion point is the equilibrium geometry on the reference surface .",
    "however one may consider nearby points , so long as nuclei remain bound and a hamiltonian quadratic in the displacements remains appropriate , at least locally .",
    "the resultant coupling then has a dual role : to introduce the additional non - equilibrium current - induced forces , and to generate inelastic electron - phonon scattering .",
    "explicit constructions of the coupling are discussed for example in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in general @xmath15 will be the sum of a 1-body electronic operator and a scalar ( both dependent on the expansion point ) .",
    "the electronic part typically is minus the gradient , with respect to nuclear displacements , of a ( possibly screened ) electron - nuclear interaction .",
    "alternatively we may think of ( [ heph ] ) as a generic model electron - phonon hamiltonian , while noting that by construction @xmath15 remains the gradient of the interaction with respect to the negative of the conjugate displacement .",
    "we will take this view here and will assume further that @xmath15 is purely a 1-body electronic quantity .",
    "the resultant calculation is exact in the reference hamiltonian , and is exact also in the perturbation , in the limit of small - amplitude atomic motion .",
    "this is important as the response coefficients that characterize current - induced forces below describe that limit .",
    "these questions are receiving renewed attention with fresh work on the many - body electron - nuclear schr \" odinger equation @xcite .",
    "our aim is to calculate the quantity @xmath16 to second order in @xmath17 , and to relate it to the motion of the centroid of the oscillator distribution .",
    "the centroid is the collection of mean displacements @xmath18 , with velocities @xmath19 ( not to be confused with the perturbing potential @xmath20 ) .",
    "the centroid @xmath21 is what we would interpret as _ classical _ coordinates , in a mixed quantum - classical picture of electron - nuclear dynamics , such as ehrenfest dynamics @xcite .",
    "@xmath22 above is the mean force exerted by electrons on degree of freedom @xmath23 .",
    "indeed @xmath24\\ ] ] and therefore ( as may be expected from the earlier discussion ) @xmath22 is the contribution to the mean rate of change of the momentum of degree of freedom @xmath23 , due to the coupling to electrons @xcite .",
    "in other words , @xmath22 is the effective force experienced by the mean displacement @xmath25 , and is what we would calculate for the force on the corresponding classical degree of freedom in the ehrenfest approximation .    for the unperturbed density matrix",
    "we now make the choice @xmath26 , where @xmath27 describes oscillators in time - evolving wavepackets with @xmath28 below we consider non - interacting electrons .",
    "however screening plays an important - and occasionally problematic - role in current - induced forces and electron - phonon scattering .",
    "an outline is given in refs .",

    "the two reservoirs have different electrochemical potentials , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and inject carriers into their respective leads with the corresponding energy distributions . formally , the injected carriers in the steady state occupy a set of stationary scattering wavefunctions , two of which are depicted schematically in the figure .",

    "the other function , @xmath77 , is odd in these indices .",
    "the final , and very important , observation is that at equilibrium , i.e. @xmath78 , the function @xmath77 will vanish .",

    "it can only bend trajectories .",
    "it can be related to the berry phase of electrons as the atoms are moving around in the electron gas @xcite , and hence the superscript @xmath126 .",
    "the function @xmath127 is even in @xmath128 and is given by @xmath129 this function decays on the frequency scale @xmath57 , and integrates to zero .",

    "a flat electron - hole density of states will produce a vanishing `` lorentz '' force .",
    "let us evaluate the electronic friction on the weak test scatterer considered earlier , now in an equilibrium homogenous electron gas for simplicity .",
    "we need to evaluate the function @xmath131 .",
    "the friction will be isotropic , so we only need the case @xmath132 .",
    "the result in the small - frequency limit is    @xmath133    where @xmath134 is the electron number density .",
    "the friction force when the scatterer is moving with velocity @xmath135 therefore is @xmath136 .",
    "but physically this situation is the same as if the electron gas were moving past a stationary scatterer , at drift velocity @xmath137 .",
    "then the wind force from ( [ fw ] ) is the same as @xmath138 , after we identify @xmath139 as the current density @xmath3 in the rest frame of the scatterer .",
    "therefore we arrive at the expected but useful result that for a free - electron metal the friction and the wind force are reciprocals of each other .",
    "this result is connected with the relation between the friction and resistivity @xcite , and between resistivity and electromigration forces @xcite .",
    "we have seen that a frequency - independent function @xmath77 will not result in a lorentz - like force .",
    "we consider our prime example of a particle moving in a flow of electrons in a thin jellium wire .",
    "it can be thought of as a set of 1d wires ( or channels ) - one for each transverse electron mode .",
    "each channel will have a density of states with a van hove singularity at the bottom of the respective subband .",
    "these strong variations of the density of states may provide the frequency dependence of @xmath77 that is needed .",
    "we consider again a test scatterer located somewhere in the square cross section of the wire , used earlier .",
    "according to the general formula ( [ lorentzforce ] ) , the defect will feel a `` lorentz '' force , @xmath140 , where the `` b''-field has a vector potential given by @xmath141\\delta(\\hbar\\omega-\\epsilon_p+\\epsilon_{p'})\\ , d\\omega\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the 1-electron state @xmath142 has three quantum numbers @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the momentum along the wire , while @xmath145 are the transverse - mode quantum numbers , with corresponding mode wavefunctions @xmath146 .",
    "it is useful to express energies in terms of the transverse energy scale @xmath147 .",

    "first , under lateral confinement @xmath155 are standing waves .",
    "the resultant interference ripples as a function of transverse position in the wire generate a non - vanishing effective `` magnetic '' field , even in the absence of longitudinal inhomogeneities or backscattering in the conductor .",
    "consider next the gross structure of the vector potential . to this end",
    "suppose that we average over the ripples due to the confinement , and treat each @xmath155 as a constant inside the wire , dropping to zero outside .",
    "this still leaves the dramatic variation in @xmath156 as we cross the wire surface , giving rise to a surface `` magnetic '' field , analogous to the curl of the non - conservative force discussed earlier .",
    "therefore the `` lorentz '' forces are of particular interest for surface atoms and adsorbates in metallic nanowires , with departures from the dynamics that might be expected otherwise .",
    "we conclude this section with a comment on the range of validity of the present discussion .",
    "the perturbative approach above requires restricted mean displacements over long times .",
    "this precludes free translation of scattering centres as a type of motion we can consider .",
    "in fact , if we allow a maximum typical displacement @xmath157 , then for motion at typical velocity @xmath158 the present approach requires a minimum frequency @xmath159 .",
    "conversely , for a given oscillator frequency @xmath128 , we require velocities below @xmath160 .",
    "an important avenue - in this context and more generally - is the expansion of the hamiltonian in ( [ heph ] ) to higher order in the oscillator displacements .",
    "finally , we may describe the `` lorentz '' force as a dynamical effect in the following sense . keeping all else fixed , the ratio of the current - induced velocity - dependent `` lorentz '' force to the current - induced displacement - dependent non - conservative force scales with frequency as @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is a pertinent electronic energy scale @xcite .",
    "therefore in the small - frequency limit the static non - conservative force dominates .",
    "as discussed earlier , @xmath22 is the force that enters the so - called ehrenfest approximation . physically , this is the mean force on nuclei , which does not yet tell us anything about force _",

    "then both the non - conservative and lorentz - like force vanish , and we are left with motion under conservative forces , along with the friction , leading to an inevitable loss of energy from the nuclear motion , whatever the nuclear kinetic energies .    but this can not be right : hot enough electrons should be delivering energy to the atomic motion , not the other way round .",
    "we conclude that there must be a key physical process missing from the ehrenfest approximation .",

    "we note further that care is required in identifying @xmath190 as @xmath191 above , as the two quantities are in general not the same .",
    "however any difference between them in the present case involves the force operators , and therefore - within the given order of perturbation theory - the identification is justified .",
    "the properties of the force noise and resultant phenomena , such as the thermal equilibration of vibrations with the electron bath and joule heating in nanowires under current , are discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we consider a single oscillator coupled to an equilibrium electron bath .",
    "the only forces present are the harmonic restoring force , the friction and the noise .",
    "we will show that the competition between the latter two enables the oscillator to equilibrate with the bath .",
    "first we must work out the correlation function ( [ corrf ] ) .",
    "the result for non - interacting independent electrons is @xmath192 where as before the indices label 1-electron states with energies @xmath193 .",
    "the occupancies @xmath194 are given by the fermi - dirac distribution , @xmath195 , and @xmath196 .",
    "we now show that a _ classical _ oscillator , under the above random force and the friction , equilibrates at mean energies that in fact obey the quantum - mechanical bose - einstein distribution .",
    "a harmonic oscillator of mass @xmath197 and angular frequency @xmath57 , subjected to an additional external force @xmath198 , undergoes velocity deviations from its native trajectory given by @xmath199 if @xmath198 is the random force above , then the power at time @xmath172 , after averaging and taking the long - time limit , is @xmath200 after some algebra this becomes @xmath201 where @xmath43 is the temperature of the electron bath .",
    "we now compare with the friction coefficient from ( [ l0 ] ) , producing the relation @xmath202 which is an expression of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .    setting @xmath203 equal to the power lost to the friction , @xmath204 ,",
    "produces the steady - state oscillator energy @xmath205 which is the bose - einstein distribution , for the given bath temperature .",
    "therefore the _ effective _ classical random force that was _ identified _ within a quantum - mechanical calculation , when applied together with the quantum - mechanical friction to a fictitious classical oscillator , has exactly the properties required to reproduce the behaviour expected from the full interacting quantum problem .",
    "one of these properties is the zero - point oscillator energy that survives even in the limit of zero bath temperature . these conclusions furthermore remain valid under non - equilibrium conditions , resulting in a remarkable mapping of quantum phonons coupled to an electron bath onto a classical stochastic problem @xcite .",
    "electron - nuclear dynamics in atomic - scale conductors is a challenging problem , combining many - body physics with the description of open quantum systems driven out of equilibrium .",
    "a further difficulty , at the root of some of the controversies that the field has experienced , is the conceptual question of what we mean by force under these general conditions and , accordingly , what framework is required for its calculation .    the aim of this article is to provide an introduction to elements of the current methodological and physical understanding of forces on nuclei in conducting systems .",
    "two of the five forces - the effective conservative confining potential and the electronic friction - are present at equilibrium ( though they collect non - equilibrium corrections ) .",
    "so too is the effective random force , responsible for joule heating and electron - phonon equilibration .",
    "the non - conservative and `` lorentz '' force are only possible under current .",
    "we have aimed at obtaining these forces in a simple way , while illustrating the physics behind them with examples .",
    "the analogy with other flows however can be deceptive .",
    "the current - induced force on a single defect in jellium ( which is always along the incident particle current ) _ is _ simple , and may be understood directly in terms of momentum transfer on the defect .",
    "but for nuclei in a solid current - induced forces can be counter - intuitive , because electrons then undergo multiple scattering in the entire region around a chosen target , with quantum - mechanical interference .",
    "this can result in forces on individual atoms with unexpected directions , including situations when the current - induced force on a defect opposes the incident electron `` beam '' .",
    "however the possibility of directional generalized angular - momentum transfer to the atomic motion is a general property of current - carrying nanowires , resulting in a potent energy - transfer mechanism .",
    "there are several active lines of research into these forces at present : the interplay between the stochastic and the non - conservative force , the properties of these forces in resonant systems ( with sharp energy features ) , the capacity of the non - conservative forces to drive electromigration or mechanical failure .",
    "there continually is scope for further fundamental and conceptual work in the area , with a potential practical pay - off , such as the question of whether - and how - one might go about subsuming current - induced forces into effective corrections to semi - empirical interatomic potentials .",
    "it is hoped that the present discussion will be of assistance to the general reader in following up past and future work in this field .",
