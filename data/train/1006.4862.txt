    "we study dimension properties of sets of furstenberg type .",
    "in particular we are interested to be able to construct very small furstenberg sets in a given class .",
    "the notion of size of a set is its hausdorff dimension , denoted by @xmath21 .",
    "we begin with the definition of classical furstenberg sets .    for @xmath0 in",
    "@xmath1 $ ] , a subset @xmath2 of @xmath3 is called _ furstenberg set _ of type @xmath0 or @xmath4-set if for each direction @xmath5 in the unit circle there is a line segment @xmath6 in the direction of @xmath5 such that the hausdorff dimension of the set @xmath7 is greater or equal than @xmath0 .",
    "we will also say that such set @xmath2 belongs to the class @xmath4 .",
    "it is known ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) that @xmath22 for any @xmath4-set @xmath23 and there are examples of @xmath4-sets @xmath2 with @xmath24 .",
    "hence , if we denote by    @xmath25    then @xmath26.\\ ] ] in @xcite the left hand side of this inequality has been extended to the case of more general dimension functions , i.e. , functions that are not necessarily power functions ( @xcite ) .",
    "a function @xmath27 will be called _ dimension function _ if it belongs to the following class : @xmath28    if one looks at the power functions , there is a natural total order given by the exponents .",
    "if we denote by @xmath29 , then @xmath30 is _ dimensionally smaller _ than @xmath31 if and only if @xmath32 . in @xmath33 ,",
    "however , by extending this natural notion of order we only obtain a _ partial _ order .    [",
    "def : order ] let @xmath34 be two dimension functions .",
    "we will say that @xmath35 is dimensionally smaller than @xmath27 and write @xmath36 if and only if @xmath37    we will be particularly interested in the special subclass of dimension functions that allows us to classify zero dimensional sets .",
    "a function @xmath38 will be called `` zero dimensional dimension function '' if @xmath39 for any @xmath40 .",
    "we denote by @xmath41 the subclass of those functions .    as usual , the @xmath27-dimensional ( outer )",
    "hausdorff measure @xmath42 will be defined as follows . for",
    "a set @xmath43 and @xmath44 , write @xmath45 the @xmath27-dimensional hausdorff measure @xmath42 of @xmath2 is defined by @xmath46 we will consider functions @xmath34 such that there exist constants @xmath47 with @xmath48 for all @xmath49 to be equivalent , even though they would not lead to the exact same measures .",
    "in that case we write @xmath50 .",
    "the hausdorff dimension of a set @xmath51 is the unique real number @xmath52 characterized by the following properties :    * @xmath53 for all @xmath54 .",
    "* @xmath55 for all @xmath56 .    therefore , to prove that a given set @xmath2 has dimension @xmath52 , it is enough to check the preceding two properties , independently if @xmath57 is zero , finite and positive , or infinite .",
    "however , in general it is not true that , given a set @xmath2 , there is a function @xmath38 , such that if @xmath58 then @xmath10 , and if @xmath59 , then @xmath60 .",
    "the difficulties arise from two results due to besicovitch ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the first says that if a set @xmath2 has null @xmath42-measure for some @xmath38 , then there exists a function @xmath35 which is dimensionally smaller than @xmath27 and for which still @xmath10 .",
    "symmetrically , the second says that if a _ compact _",
    "set @xmath2 has non-@xmath61-finite @xmath42 measure , then there exists a function @xmath58 such that @xmath2 has also non-@xmath61-finite @xmath62 measure .",
    "these two results imply that if a set @xmath2 satisfies that there exists a function @xmath27 such that @xmath63 for any @xmath59 and @xmath10 for any @xmath58 , then it must be the case that @xmath64 .",
    "this is the particular case in which @xmath2 is a so called @xmath27-set ( generalizing the notion of @xmath52-set for those @xmath52-dimensional sets that satisfy @xmath65 .",
    "but if we look for example at the set @xmath66 of liouville numbers , this set is not an @xmath27-set for any @xmath38 .",
    "these sets are called _ dimensionless _ ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , it is shown in @xcite that there are two proper nonempty subsets @xmath67 of dimension functions such that @xmath68 for all @xmath69 and @xmath70 for all @xmath71 .",
    "this motivates the following notion of dimension partition ( see @xcite ) .      by the _ dimension partition _ of a set @xmath2",
    "we mean a partition of @xmath72 into ( three ) sets : @xmath73 with    * @xmath74 .",
    "* @xmath75 . *",
    "@xmath76 .    note that by the previous example , it is clear that there are sets @xmath2 for which @xmath77 is empty , reflecting the dimensionless nature of @xmath2 . on the other hand , @xmath77 is never empty for an @xmath27-set , but it is not easy to determine this partition in the general case",
    ". we also remark that it is possible to find non - comparable dimension functions @xmath78 and a set @xmath2 with the property of being a @xmath35-set and an @xmath27-set simultaneously .",
    "it follows that even for @xmath27-sets the dimension partition , and in particular @xmath77 , is not completely determined .",
    "note that the results of besicovitch cited above imply that , for compact sets , @xmath79 and @xmath80 can be thought of as open components of the partition , and @xmath77 as the `` border '' of these open components .",
    "an interesting problem is then to determine some criteria to classify the functions in @xmath72 into those classes .    to detect where this `` border '' is",
    ", we will introduce the notion of _ chains _ in @xmath72 .",
    "this notion allows to refine the notion of hausdorff dimension by using an ordered family of dimension functions .",
    "more precisely , we have the following definition .    a family @xmath81 of dimension functions",
    "will be called a _ chain _ if it is of the form @xmath82 that is , a totally ordered one - parameter family of dimension functions .",
    "suppose that @xmath38 belongs to some chain @xmath83 and satisfies that , for any @xmath84 , @xmath63",
    "if @xmath59 and @xmath10 if @xmath58 . then , even if @xmath85 , in this chain , @xmath27 does measure the size of @xmath2 .",
    "it can be thought of as being `` near the frontier '' of both @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "for example , if a set @xmath2 has hausdorff dimension @xmath0 but @xmath86 or @xmath87 , take @xmath29 and @xmath88 . in this chain",
    ", @xmath30 is the function that best measures the size of @xmath2 .",
    "we look for finer estimates , considering chains of dimension functions that separate sets of `` the same hausdorff dimension '' . the goal will be to find very fine chains to give precise bounds on how far from an expected dimension function the hausdorff measure drops to zero or remains positive . in this setting",
    ", the sharpness of the results are associated to the `` fineness '' of the chains .",
    "consider , for example , a set @xmath89 such that @xmath90 , in which case it is clear that @xmath91 for all @xmath92 .",
    "compare the chain @xmath93 ( which only detects the hausdorff dimension of @xmath89 ) to @xmath94 , in which we can detect if there exists @xmath95 for which @xmath96 and @xmath97 for all @xmath92 .    to measure this distance between to dimension functions",
    ", we introduce the following notion :    let @xmath98 with @xmath59 .",
    "define the `` gap '' between @xmath35 and @xmath27 as @xmath99    from this definition and the definition of partial order , we always have that @xmath100 , and therefore the speed of convergence to zero of @xmath101 can be seen as a notion of distance between @xmath35 and @xmath27 .",
    "the analogous definition of furstenberg sets in the setting of dimension functions is the following .",
    "[ def : furs ] let @xmath102 be a dimension function .",
    "a set @xmath103 is a furstenberg set of type @xmath102 , or an @xmath104-set , if for each direction @xmath105 there is a line segment @xmath6 in the direction of @xmath5 such that @xmath106 .",
    "in @xcite we proved that the appropriate dimension function for an @xmath104 set @xmath2 must be dimensionally not much smaller than @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( this is the generalized version of the left hand side of ) , the latter with some additional conditions on @xmath102 .",
    "there we also presented precise bounds on the dimensional gaps .",
    "these results are valid for all dimension functions @xmath102 - minding the small restrictions on the decay of @xmath102 for the second bound - regardless of the fact that @xmath102 is ( or is not ) zero - dimensional .",
    "we also exhibited an example of a zero dimensional furstenburg - type set with @xmath109 points in each direction , proving that for this case , @xmath110 contradicting the nave limiting argument in equation , that @xmath111 .",
    "( it seems feasible to find an argument to also construct a zero dimensional @xmath112-set for @xmath113 points as remarked by keleti and mth @xcite ) however , if we consider zero - dimensional furstenberg - type sets belonging to @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is defined by @xmath116 , we showed that any @xmath19 must have @xmath117 .    in the present work we look at a refinement of the upper bound for the dimension of furstenberg sets .",
    "since we are looking for upper bounds on a class of furstenberg sets , the aim will be to explicitly construct a very small set belonging to the given class .",
    "we first consider the classical case of power functions , @xmath118 , for @xmath119 .",
    "recall that for this case , the known upper bound implies that , for any positive @xmath0 , there is a set @xmath9 such that @xmath120 for any @xmath92 .",
    "we improve this estimate in terms of logarithmic gaps by showing that there is no need to take a `` power like '' step from the critical dimension .",

    "then , there is an @xmath4-set @xmath2 such that @xmath122 for any @xmath12 ( ) .",

    "we will also focus at the endpoint @xmath124 , and give a complete answer about the size of a class of furstenberg sets by proving that , for any given @xmath16 , there exists a set @xmath125 such that ( ) @xmath126 note that , when @xmath127 , the dimension functions @xmath128 increase , `` approaching '' from below the positive - dimensional case .",
    "however , when @xmath129 , the functions decrease , `` approaching '' the sets having finitely many ( or countably many ) points in each direction .",
    "in this latter case , a zero - dimensional furstenberg set can be constructed @xcite .",
