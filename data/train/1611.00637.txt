    "over the years compass models have proved especially useful in the modeling of materials with multi - orbital degrees of freedom@xcite ; these hamiltonians describe fictitious spin degrees of freedom that have fully anisotropic spatial interactions@xcite .",
    "currently they are very prominent in both theoretical and experimental studies of the physics of iridium - oxide materials@xcite , the @xmath0rucl@xmath1 compound@xcite and finally the purported application of the kitaev model@xcite to quantum computing .",
    "neutron scattering@xcite and nmr experiments@xcite have provided convincing evidence that kitaev model physics dominates the effective hamiltonian describing @xmath0rucl@xmath1 , although the inclusion of further interactions , especially heisenberg exchange , seem to be necessary for a consistent description of the experiments .",
    "additionally , thermal conductivity experiments could shed more light on the relevant interactions in these exotic quantum magnets .",
    "the standard theoretical approach to the spin dynamics analysis of the kitaev model is the elegant and powerful majorana fermion solution@xcite .",
    "so far most studies have focused on the zero temperature limit@xcite . however , at finite temperatures monte carlo methods have been used@xcite to sample the auxiliary majorana fields and there are exact diagonalization studies on restricted lattices@xcite .    in the high temperature limit ,",
    "a long standing approach to spin dynamics has been the moment method@xcite . in this work ,",
    "we point out that the peculiar structure of compass model hamiltonians maps the moment enumeration to a branching model , though there are certain extra initial constraints specific to each model . in the following ,",
    "we discuss as examples the compass model on the two dimensional honeycomb lattice ( the so called kitaev model ) and the two - dimensional compass model on a square lattice .",
    "our main focus is to compare the qualitative features obtained from different model branching processes to the exact spin autocorrelation results obtained by diagonalization of the hamiltonian on a finite size lattice .",
    "the validity of the mapping rests so far on the qualitative agreement with frequency spectra obtained by ed .",
    "it is amusing that such simple combinatorial models reproduce the essential features of these quantum many - body models , providing another instance of correspondence between quantum mechanical and statistical mechanics problems .",
    "it would be interesting also to consider the inverse procedure , where statistical mechanics problems can be solved by corresponding compass models .",
    "primarily we are interested in the evaluation of the spin autocorrelation function @xmath2 where @xmath3 are pauli spin-1/2 operators , and @xmath4 , @xmath5",
    ". we will also briefly discuss further spatial correlations , @xmath6    @xmath7 denotes a thermal average at temperature @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 ) . in the infinite temperature limit , @xmath10",
    ", the autocorrelation function reduces to a trace over all the hilbert space , @xmath11 @xmath12 being the number of spins on the lattice .",
    "expanding in powers of time , @xmath13 the autocorrelation function analysis reduces to the evaluation of the moments @xmath14@xcite ,    @xmath15    where @xmath16=ha - ah$ ] is the liouville operator .",
    "the time fourier transform of @xmath17 ,    @xmath18    can alternatively be evaluated by an extension in complex frequencies @xmath19 , @xmath20    @xmath21.\\ ] ]    @xmath22 is then conveniently expressed as a continued fraction expansion ,    @xmath23    with the coefficients @xmath24 related the moments @xmath14 by recursion relations@xcite .    in the following",
    "we will present an approximate evaluation of the moments @xmath14 and the corresponding structure of @xmath24 by mapping them to combinatorial branching models .",
    "the kitaev model on a honeycomb lattice is given by the hamiltonian , @xmath25    where @xmath26 denotes the nearest neighbor bonds in the three directions on the lattice , with the convention indicated in fig.[ktv](0 ) .",
    "the central operator @xmath27 ( that subsequently is abbreviated just by @xmath28 ) represents the operator @xmath29 at the initial time @xmath30 .",
    "we find that repeatedly applying the liouville operator , @xmath31 , as in ( [ liouville ] ) creates strings of operators as depicted in the subsequent parts of fig.[ktv ] . because of the 3-fold geometry of the honeycomb lattice ,",
    "the string operators are organized into three branches , each one starting with an @xmath32 , @xmath33 or @xmath34 bond .",
    "fig.[ktv]@xmath35 indicate the two possible operator strings created by one application of @xmath31 on @xmath36 .",
    "the third sting , along the z - bond , vanishes at this order . in ( @xmath37 )",
    "the four possible ( non - vanishing ) strings created by the application of @xmath31 on ( @xmath38 ) are shown ( note that there are an additional four , symmetrically related , strings for ( @xmath39 ) which are not shown ) .",
    "then , the application of the trace in ( [ liouville ] ) gives zero for all but the first diagram shown in fig.[ktv]@xmath40 : the zero - length string which is just the operator @xmath41 .",
    "consequently there are only two contributions to the second moment , @xmath42 : this one and the analogous diagram arising from the application of @xmath31 on ( @xmath39).the problem of applying @xmath31 on a operator string is therefore mapped to a branching process in three directions , where at each iteration the tail operator in a branch either disappears or a new one is created in one of the three possible directions ( although with some specific restrictions at the origin which we will discus later ) .    in the high temperature limit , the trace of any string of non - zero length vanishes .",
    "thus , evaluating the moments reduces to counting all of the possible branching processes that culminate in the complete annihilation of the strings ( i.e. they return to just a single @xmath41 operator ) .",
    "each branching configuration contributes a factor of @xmath43 from each application of @xmath31 to the value of the contribution to a moment .",
    "this arises from the spin commutation involving the bond-@xmath44 ; the factor for annihilating a particular link turns out to always have the opposite sign to that corresponding to its creation . as an example , the third order diagram shown in fig.[ktv]@xmath45 represents the operator string : @xmath46 henceforth we will only consider @xmath47 , although generalising to the anisotropic case is feasible . in summary , it therefore seems that the minimal model is branching in three independent directions .",
    "however , as we will now discuss , this is not quite adequate .",
    "there are some extra initial constraints and also some `` higher order '' processes that need consideration .",
    "we find that the branching model must obey the following ` rules ' :    \\(i ) side - branching is not possible and the operator at a vertex is given by the direction of the missing bond ;    \\(ii ) applying @xmath31 in the middle of a branch annihilates the entire operator string ;    \\(iii ) independent branching along all three directions is not possible : there are initial restrictions",
    ". a branch along the @xmath19-direction can not be created at first order .",
    "instead , it can only be initiated when either an @xmath48-direction or a @xmath49-direction branch already exists , as depicted in fig.[ktv](@xmath37 ) .",
    "this initial restriction effects the lowest order moments and thus the high frequency behavior of the spectral function .",
    "\\(iv ) branches must be annihilated in the reverse order to which they were created or the contribution from the entire string vanishes .",
    "\\(v ) possible higher order processes are not taken into account where the branching structure is modified e.g. at the origin and then eventually reconstructed and annihilated .",
    "\\(vi ) finally , as shown in fig.[ktv]@xmath50 , the branching process is self - avoiding .     values . ]",
    "[ ktvspectrum ]    in the inset of fig.[ktv ] we show the values of @xmath24 evaluated from the moments @xmath14 for the two models , the branching process without ( shown in red ) and with ( shown in black ) the initial constraints .",
    "it is clear that for large values of @xmath51 the @xmath24 s asymptotically coincide . in these branching model calculations , however , we have omitted the self - avoidance constraint .    to estimate the applicability of the branching model we compare in fig.[ktv ] the spectra obrained by the branching models with ( c ) and without ( un ) initial constraints",
    "also shown are results from an exact diagonalization study ( ed ) on a lattice of 4 by 6 spins . with periodic boundary conditions . here",
    "we calculated in the high temperature limit using the microcanonical lanczos method@xcite .",
    "100 lanczos iterations were used to converge to an infinite temperature state and 400 further iterations to obtain the continuous fraction expansion .",
    "the @xmath52function peak at zero frequency is a finite size effect due to an excess of degenerate states in small lattices .",
    "the agreement is fair with the model when including initial constraints ( despite omitting the self - avoidance requirement ) and can be fitted by a form @xmath53 .",
    "next , we will study the 2d - compass model , using the same approach as previously .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by , @xmath54    with the bond - labeling convention used depicted in fig.[compass](0 ) .",
    "analogously to our discussion of the kitaev model , repeated applications of the liouville operator creates strings of operators which can propagate with up to four branches : see fig.[compass ] . the same procedure for obtaining the moments @xmath14 and corresponding @xmath24 of this combinatorial model can then be applied , but with the same reservations on possibly omitted high - order processes .",
    "this time there are a different set of restrictions specific to the 2d compass model .",
    "firstly , we find that the operator strings must propagate alternatively along @xmath48-links and @xmath49-links . trying to extend the string along two consecutive @xmath48-links ( or @xmath49-links )",
    "causes the entire string to vanish .",
    "this also means that the internal spin operators along the length of the string are all @xmath27 s .",
    "secondly , we note that , as there was in the kitaev model , there are initial constraints on the order in which the four different branches can be created and subsequently destroyed .",
    "finally , the branching model is again self - avoiding .    to investigate the infinite temperature spin - autocorrelation for the isotropic 2d compass model we have calculated a finite number of moments for two different branching models : one which includes the initial constraints , and one with out . in both cases ,",
    "however , we have again omitted the self - avoidance requirement .",
    "the @xmath24 parameters that we have calculated are shown in the inset of fig.[compassspectrum ]",
    ".     values . ]",
    "the subsequent @xmath55 spectrum is shown in fig.[compassspectrum ] for the branching model including the initial branch - creation - order constraint ( c ) and without this initial constraint ( un ) .",
    "these are compared to the spectrum obtained by a microcanonical lanczos calculation ( ed ) on a lattice of 4 by 6 spins .",
    "it is interesting to see that even the non - monotonic behaviour of @xmath55 is reproduced when including the initial branch  creation - order constraint .",
    "in contrast , the unconstrained branching behaviour can not capture this , indicating that it arises due to the degeneracy of the first two @xmath56 values .    by using the same approach of expanding the time dependance as a function of the liouville operator",
    ", we can also consider further - range spin correlation in the high temperature limit .",
    "@xmath57 consequently , we deduce , that for @xmath58 all correlations vanish in the infinite temperature limit .",
    "this occurs because the initial pair of operators @xmath59 can not be reduced to the identity by application of @xmath31 .",
    "next we can consider finite temperatures by expanding @xmath60 in powers of @xmath61 .",
    "then we can plausibly argue that we obtain a finite value for the correlations @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is a nearest neighbor site in the @xmath44 lattice direction . however , further - neighbour correlations all vanish identically at all temperatures . again",
    ", this is because it is impossible to reduce any of the resulting operator strings to the identity by application of either @xmath31 or @xmath61 .",
    "this result has already been found for the kitaev model using the majorana fermion approach@xcite , but our analysis shows that it also holds for the 2d compass model too .",
    "presumably this is also the case for other quantum compass models where the is no analytical solution is not known .    in conclusion , the above analysis , to an extent heuristic , provides an interesting new perspective .",
    "firstly , we have discovered that the infinite temperature spin - autocorrelation function of quantum compass models can be mapped onto a statistical - mechanical branching problem ( along with some additional , model - specific restrictions ) .",
    "we have discussed the results from calculating a finite number of moments for two different isotropic compass models , investigating the effects of appropriately including the model - specific initial restricts on the branching - scheme . despite omitting the self - avoidance requirement ,",
    "this provided a useful insight into the shape of these correlation functions .",
    "these techniques also have the potential to be generalised to anisotropic couplings @xmath64 and the evaluation of finite temperature correlations .",
    "it may be feasible to obtain analytic expressions for the moments of a constraint - free branching model , but it is clear that an exact evaluation of the autocorrelation function requires the implementation of self - avoidance , which is well - known to be a highly non - trivial problem .",
    "this raises the interesting question of whether the inverse procedure : solving self - avoiding statistical mechanics problems by means of a mapping onto a corresponding quantum compass model could be used .",
    "this appears to be another instance of corresponding between quantum mechanical and statistical mechanics problems .",
    "finally , we note that other types of correlations functions , for example those related to transport properties , can also be studied using this technique .",
