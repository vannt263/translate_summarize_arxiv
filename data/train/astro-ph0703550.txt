    "schmidt ( 1959 ) law of star formation ( sf ) was first formulated in terms of local sf rate @xmath0 proportional to the hi gas density with a power index n ( @xmath1 , n@xmath21 - 3 ) as the atomic gas was then known as the major component of interstellar gas reservoir to possibly form stars .",
    "more than a decade later , observations of the co line emission in the milky way and external galaxies enabled by millimeter ( mm ) astronomy suggest that stars are forming in the giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) . from 80 s ,",
    "e.g. , kennicutt ( 1983 ) found little evidence in parameterizing the global sf law in external galaxies in terms of the total hi gas .",
    "but he succeeded in terms of the disk - averaged surface @xmath0 and total surface gas densities of both hi and h@xmath3 ( kennicutt 1989 ) .",
    "however , a well determined power index n was still not practical .",
    "other researchers also obtained a wide range of the power index from 1 to 3 .",
    "recently , kennicutt ( 1998 ) seemed to obtain a well determined slope of 1.4 though discrepancy exists ( e.g. , heyer et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "we here show that the sf law in terms of the dense gas is a rather simple linear relation ( gao & solomon 2004a , gs04a ) and is straight - forward to understand in what we have learned so far from the physics of sf .",
    "the cool atomic gas has the potential to convert into molecular form to possibly provide the fuel to make stars , yet even the bulk of molecular gas and the most regions of gmcs are not making stars except for those tiny dense cores .",
    "great observatories indeed begin to directly link / picture the heavily obscured dusty regions of active sf , embedded in gmcs as mapped by mm / sub - mm telescopes , to the current massive sf .",
    "r0.55 -0.2 in    -0.1 in    high - dipole moment molecules such as hcn trace more than order of magnitude higher gas density than that of co. a major hcn survey in a wide range of 65 galaxies , including 10 ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , tripled the sample of galaxies with global hcn measurements ( gao & solomon 2004b ) .",
    "analysis of the various relationships among the global hcn , co , and fir luminosities can be statistically conducted for the first time ( gs04a ) .    the strong ir ",
    "hcn correlation is linear and extremely tight over 3 orders of magnitude in luminosity , when compared to the non - linear ir ",
    "co correlation ( gs04a ) . while the high luminosity of ulirgs requires an elevated sf efficiency of the total molecular gas indicated by @xmath4 , the @xmath0 per unit of _ dense _ molecular gas , the sf efficiency of the _ dense _ molecular gas indicated by ( @xmath5 ) is almost constant and independent of the ir luminosity or total @xmath0",
    "further , gs04a find the surprising absence of any correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , yet a still strong correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath7 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "this suggests that the hcn ",
    "ir correlation is more physical than the co  ir correlation and that the global sf efficiency depends on the fraction of the molecular gas in a dense phase ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "this is somehow reminiscent of the poor hi ",
    "ir correlation vs. the better co  ir correlation discoverd more than two decades ago .    the direct consequence of the linear ir ",
    "hcn correlation is that the sf law in terms of _ dense _ gas has a power law index of 1 , which is different from the widely used kennicutt ( 1998 ) law of a slope of 1.4 for the disk averaged @xmath0 as a function of the total gas ( hi and @xmath8 ) . as we show in next section that this 1.4 law is not unique , neither valid for normal spiral galaxies nor for extreme starbursts / ulirgs .",
    "the @xmath0@xmath9 ( ir  co ) is essentially linear up to @xmath10 ( fig .",
    "this seems to also be true in terms of the mean surface densities of the @xmath0 and molecular gas mass for the nearest galaxies with spatially resolved observations ( e.g. , wong & blitz 2002 ) .",
    "thus the linear form of the global sf law in terms of total molecular gas density as traced by co for normal galaxies is due to the constant dense gas mass fraction ( hcn / co ) in normal galaxies ( gs04a ) . for normal spirals ,",
    "the sf law is linear in terms of both the total molecular gas and the dense molecular gas .",
    "a fit for the normal galaxies in the ir ",
    "co correlation in hcn sample gives a slope of 1.0 .",
    "but there is a poor correlation between the @xmath0 and the gas surface density in kennicutt ( 1998 ) normal galaxy sample , difficult to derive a reasonable slope from normal galaxy sample alone .",
    "r0.55 -0.2 in    -0.1 in    a direct orthogonal regression fit for all galaxies in hcn sample leads to a slope of 1.4 ( the least - squares fit slope is 1.3 ) .",
    "these fits are almost identical to the sf law power index in kennicutt s ( 1998 ) 36 circumnuclear starbursts sample .",
    "it is obvious from fig .",
    "2a that only galaxies with @xmath0 @xmath11 /yr ( mostly ulirgs ) lie above the slope 1 .",
    "the combination of normal galaxies and ulirgs leads to a fit of 1.4 .",
    "therefore , this slope is not a universal slope at all as it changes according to the sample selection .",
    "the kennicutt s ( 1998 ) 1.4 slope is determined mostly from the starburst sample .",
    "the circumnuclear starbursts have some of the characteristics of ulirgs , e.g. , a high dense gas fraction indicated by high hcn / co ratio .",
    "when we add more ulirgs into the sample , the slope becomes steeper , and the fits lead to a slope of 1.7 .",
    "it is clear that the ulirgs steepen the slope of the fit .",
    "there also appears to be a trend that some normal spirals with the lowest @xmath12 and @xmath13 in kennicutt s sample tend to lie below the 1.4 fit . adding more extreme galaxies , both ulirgs and low luminosity galaxies , tends to steepen the slope towards 2 .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to derive a unique 1.4 power law based upon the total molecular gas or the total gas content .",
    "the sf law in terms of dense gas has a unique slope of 1 ( fig .",
    "2b ) since the global @xmath0 is linearly proportional to the mass of the dense molecular gas .",
    "parameterization in terms of observable mean surface densities of the dense molecular gas and the @xmath0 wo nt change the slope of 1 as both quantities are simply normalized by the same galaxy disk area .",
    "this linear sf law in dense gas seems valid for all star - forming galaxies .",
    "r0.55 -0.12 in   -0.1 in    remarkably , the hcn ",
    "ir linear correlation is also valid to gmc dense cores implying the same physics drives the active sf in both dense cores and galaxies ( wu et al . 2005 ) .",
    "new sensitive hcn line observations of four high - redshift submillimeter ( sub - mm ) galaxies and qsos with the vla including first possible hcn detection of a submm galaxy ( gao et al .",
    "2006 ) , combined with previous hcn detections and upper limits ( e.g. , carilli et al . 2005 ) strongly suggest galaxies at high - redshift follow this same linear law ( fig .",
    "3 ) . the sf law in dense gas appears linear all the way from dense cores to extreme starbursts at high - z , spanning over nine orders of magnitude in @xmath0 or fir luminosity .",
    "the @xmath0 in a galaxy depends linearly on the dense molecular gas content as traced by hcn , regardless of the galaxy luminosity or the presence of a `` starburst '' , and not the total molecular gas and/or atomic gas traced by co and/or hi observations respectively .",
    "since dense molecular cloud cores are the sites of high mass sf , it is the physical properties , location and mass of these cores that set the @xmath0 . a detailed sf law can be determined from observations directly probing the milky way cloud cores with spatially resolved measurements and the resolved measurements in nearby star - forming galaxies can bridge the dense cores with the galaxies .",
    "the global @xmath0 of a star - forming system is best characterized by its mass of dense gas , @xmath14 . the gas density traced by",
    "hcn emission is apparently near the threshold for rapid sf .",
    "although @xmath0 indicated fir correlates with the various cold neutral gas reservoirs ( hi , h@xmath3 , hcn  dense h@xmath3 ) , the fir - hi is the worst among all and the fir - co is non - linear and has larger scatter than that of fir - hcn . the best and tightest fir - hcn correlation is a linear relation which implies , under the assumption of the constant conversion factors , a linear sf law that @xmath0 is simply proportional to the amount of dense molecular gas available to form high mass stars .",
    "other sf laws based on fir - co or fir-(hi+h@xmath3 ) wo nt have a unique power index .",
    "this linear fir - hcn relation appears to be valid all the way from dense cores in gmcs to extreme starbursts at high - z , revealing the same physics that massive sf drives most of the energy output in all these systems .",
    "i wish to express my gratitudes to my collaborators , particularly phil solomon , for their contributions .",
    "china nsf ( distinguished young scholars ) & chinese academy of sciences ( hundred - elite ) are thanked for their supports ."
