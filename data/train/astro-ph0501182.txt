    "clusters of galaxies have received intensive observational study over the last decades .",
    "this effort has lead to clear results on the way galaxy properties , such as morphology and star formation rate , vary within clusters and how these properties evolve between clusters at different redshifts ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * see bower & balogh 2004 for a recent review ) .",
    "in contrast , comparably  detailed studies of galaxy groups and their evolution have only recently begun in earnest .",
    "the group environment is likely to have a significant impact on star formation rates in the member galaxies @xcite and recent work has emphasied that even for galaxies now in rich clusters , much of the transformation of the galaxies properties may have taken place in groups embedded in the filamentary structure @xcite .",
    "in addition , while few galaxies in the local universe are located in clusters , up to 50 per cent @xcite may be located in galaxy groups .",
    "furthermore , this number is strongly redshift  dependent , as a larger and larger fraction of galaxies become members of groups as the large - scale structure of the universe develops .",
    "thus the properties of galaxies in groups and the impact of the group environment on the evolution of galaxies can have an important bearing on the decline of the cosmic star formation rate from @xmath0 to the present - day @xcite .",
    "studies of nearby groups show that their galaxy populations exhibit properties which vary from cluster - like ( mostly early - type ) to field - like ( mostly late type ) @xcite .",
    "however we know that groups span a wide range in local density , upon which the morphological composition @xcite and the mean star forming properties @xcite strongly depend ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the wide range of galaxy populations found in nearby groups is likely to be a natural consequence of these correlations .",
    "conversely , the powerful dependence of galaxy properties on local densities typical of groups suggests that groups provide the ideal environment for galaxy transformations .",
    "this may result in the strong dependence of early type fraction and passive dwarf galaxy abundance on group velocity dispersion and x - ray luminosity , observed in nearby groups @xcite .",
    "in particular , galaxy interactions are expected to be common in groups , in which the velocity dispersion is typically not much larger than that of the constituent galaxies @xcite .",
    "groups have a much lower density contrast against the background galaxy population , so most work has concentrated on groups which are either unusually compact @xcite or x - ray luminous @xcite .",
    "more recently , the advent of large field galaxy redshift surveys has made it possible to study galaxy groups selected purely on the basis of their three dimensional galaxy density . in the local universe , early redshift surveys and more recently the extensive 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) have generated large group catalogues which can be used as the basis for studies of galaxies in the group environment @xcite however , the properties of higher redshift groups have been relatively little explored .",
    "this is largely because of the difficulty in finding suitable systems , and the low success rate of spectroscopic follow - up of group members .",
    "@xcite used radio galaxies to preselect groups in order to study the evolution of the blue galaxy fraction with redshift , while @xcite have presented a group catalogue based on the cnoc2 galaxy redshift survey .    in this paper , we present new data obtained in the region of 26 cnoc2 groups at @xmath3 with ldss2 on magellan . in sections  [ sec :",
    "cnoc2groupdata ] and  [ sec : whyoiiforsf ] we introduce the data and explain why we have chosen to use the [ oii ] emission line to study statistical trends in star formation . in section  [ sec : cnoc2dataprocessing ] we begin by describing the data reduction procedure and our method for determination of redshifts and emission line equivalent widths for each galaxy .",
    "section  [ sec : grpmem ] then goes on to explain our procedure for group membership allocation . in section",
    "[ sec : indivgrps ] we present the properties of the 26 individual groups in order to examine any trends of structural group properties with star formation .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : stackedgrp ] groups are stacked to enable detailed statistical analaysis , and we investigate the link between the group environment and star formation by contrasting the stacked group with our sample of field galaxies selected from the same redshift range .    in a second paper (",
    "* hereafter known as paper  ii ) , we present a comparison of the star forming properties of these intermediate redshift groups with local groups selected from the 2pigg catalogue at @xmath4 @xcite .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume a @xmath5cdm cosmology of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the second canadian network for observational cosmology redshift survey ( cnoc2 ) was recently completed with the aim of studying galaxy clustering in the redshift range @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the cnoc2 survey is split into 4 patches , approximately equally spaced in ra and totalling 1.5 square degrees in area .",
    "the survey consists of 5 colour @xmath10 photometry with @xmath11 galaxies down to the photometric limit @xmath12 .",
    "the mos spectrograph on the cfht 3.6 m telescope was used to obtain spectra for over @xmath13 galaxies in total , 48 per cent complete down to @xmath14 .",
    "combination of the imaging and spectroscopy lead to a very well determined selection function for the spectroscopic sample @xcite and comparisons with our deeper spectroscopy suggest that brighter than this limit the cnoc2 survey is not biased towards emission line objects .",
    "the transmission efficiency of the band limiting filter and grism combination was above half power in the wavelength range @xmath15 , effectively limiting the redshift range of the survey .",
    "the most prominent absorption features ( ca ii h and k ) lie in this wavelength range for galaxies in the redshift range @xmath16 , whereas either the [ oii ] or [ oiii ] emission lines fall in this wavelength range for all galaxies in the range @xmath17 .",
    "distant groups have always been difficult to recognize because of their sparse galaxy populations .",
    "the presence of high redshift groups has typically been inferred indirectly via the presence of a radio galaxy or x - ray emitting intragroup medium ( igm , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "whilst these surveys provide a useful insight into the evolution of galaxy properties in rich galaxy groups , the selection criteria strongly bias the selection towards these richer elliptical dominated groups , whereas low redshift samples point to a more numerous population of low density , x - ray faint , spiral dominated groups @xcite .",
    "the cnoc2 survey provided an powerful opportunity to generate a kinematically selected sample of galaxy groups .",
    "a friends - of - friends percolation algorithm was used to detect groups of galaxies in redshift space .",
    "this was followed by a trimming step in which a centre , velocity dispersion , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 virial radius ) were estimated and then members were added or deleted within @xmath21 and @xmath22 in 3 rounds of iteration ( see * ? ? ?",
    "a total sample of over 200 galaxy groups was detected .",
    "although the spectroscopic sample is incomplete , this group sample represents a kinematically selected sample at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath23 ) , free from the strong biases present in samples selected by other means .",
    "we used the multi - object spectrograph ldss2 ( low dispersion survey spectrograph ) on the 6.5 m baade telescope at las companas observatory ( lco ) in chile to obtain a deeper and more complete sample of galaxies in the region of 20 of the cnoc2 groups at @xmath3 located in the 3 out of 4 cnoc2 patches accessible from the latitude of lco .",
    "masks were designed using an automated selection algorithm to minimise selection bias and maximise the allocation of targets per mask . due to the proximity on the sky of some of the cnoc2 groups ,",
    "the masks were chosen to serendipitously sample a further 11 groups from the @xcite sample , although only 6 of these lie at @xmath24 .",
    "targets were prioritised using an automated algorithm which favours brighter objects and objects which lie close together along the mask s spectral axis .",
    "this second criterion ensures that the spectral coverage does not vary wildly from object to object in each mask .",
    "the data were taken in 4 separate observing runs between may 2001 and november 2002 .",
    "each ldss2 mask covers approximately 6.5@xmath25 5  and in the cnoc2 fields it is normal to fit between 20 and 30 slits onto a mask .",
    "between 1 and 3 masks were observed per target group , depending upon the density of target galaxies in that area of sky .",
    "mask exposures varied from 1 to 4 hours depending on the phase of the moon and observing conditions . for maximum throughput , the blue - optimised medium resolution grism was used with a dispersion of 5.3  ( on the fourth run the red optimised grism was used which has the same dispersion and similar efficiency at wavelengths of interest ) .",
    "the slits have a width @xmath26which corresponds to @xmath27  of spectral coverage ( compared to @xmath28  in the original cnoc2 masks ) . using the cnoc2 photometric classifier from the cnoc2 photometric catalogue",

    ". normalisation by the continuum reduces uncertainties related to absorption by dust and aperture bias as well as providing a measure of sfr per unit luminosity .",
    "we extracted and calibrated our spectra using mainly iraf tools in the _ onedspec _ and _ twodspec _ packages .",
    "wavelength calibration was applied using both iraf tools and new mos reduction software written by dan kelson in carnegie @xcite .",

    "the wavelength calibration is based upon arcs taken during daytime and is secure in the wavelength range @xmath35@xmath36  which corresponds to @xmath37 for the [ oii ] emission line and @xmath38 for [ oiii ] which extends far beyond the redshift range of interest .",
    "around bright skylines , systematic residuals often remain .",
    "we interpolated over these regions .    to account for mismatch between the daytime arc and nighttime science observations",
    ", we then applied a zero point offset to the wavelength calibration .",
    "this is computed by measuring the offset of the 5577skyline in the arc - calibrated frames .",
    "most of these offsets were @xmath39  and we did not detect any significant non - linearities .",
    "the new wavelength solution appears robust , as evidenced in the comparison of ldss2 and cnoc2 redshifts ( see figure  [ fig : zoiicomp ] which is explained in section  [ sec : cnoc2cfldss2 ] ) .      the iraf tool _ xcsao _ in the _ rvsao _ package @xcite was used to cross - correlate all the spectra with templates of rest - frame early - type ( absorption line ) and late - type ( emission line ) galaxies .",
    "the early - type galaxy template was created by coadding a large number of high signal to noise early type galaxy spectra from the sample , each of which had been shifted to zero redshift .",
    "the emission line ( sc ) template is a high signal to noise spectrum of ngc4775 from the atlas of @xcite and smoothed to the resolution of ldss2 . @xcite .",

    "the peak in the cross - correlation spectrum is selected by _",
    "xcsao _ to give an estimate of the redshift for each object @xcite .",
    "to assess redshift measurements , redshifts attained using the early - type ( absorption ) and late - type ( emission ) templates were assessed in each case by manually inspecting the spectra and assigning a redshift quality flag .",
    "the quality assessment is based upon the number of believable emission lines in an emission line spectrum . in absorption line spectra",
    ", we simply decide whether to accept or reject a solution .",
    "for example , a solution with a visible 4000  break would be accepted .",
    "spectra containing a single emission line received further checks to ensure the emission is real .",
    "finally , redshifts which became apparent upon visual inspection were applied by setting up that solution as the initial guess in _",
    "rvsao_. however , if no peak in the cross - correlation spectrum could be obtained at the correct redshift then the solution was abandoned .",
    "the final redshift of a target was selected by comparing the redshift quality flag from emission and absorption redshifts . where the absorption and emission redshifts agree within errors , emission redshifts are preferred due to their greater accuracy . however , where the emission redshift was not secure and a different , higher quality absorption redshift exists , then the absorption redshift is used .",
    "objects with no acceptable redshift are discounted from the spectroscopic sample .",
    "in total we have 418 redshifts from the ldss2 data of which 240 are in the range @xmath40 which dramatically improves the completeness at this depth . in the whole sample",

    "this increases the total group sample to 295 in 26 groups ( see group membership section for further details of group allocation ) . in the magnitude range @xmath40 and within 150  of targetted group centres",
    ", we obtained 179 additional redshifts ( 36 members ) on top of the 115 ( 27 members ) existing from the cnoc2 survey .",
    "we consider @xmath41 to be our magnitude limit at which we can obtain redshifts for @xmath42 per cent of objects targetted ; our success rate for all targetted galaxies brighter than @xmath41 is 74 per cent .",
    "the selection functions are well understood and targetted galaxies for which we do not manage to obtain a redshift are evenly distributed in colour , suggesting that our sample is unbiased ( see appendix  [ sec : completeness ] ) .",
    "we measure the [ oii ] equivalent widths using our own purpose written code to compare the flux in two separate continuum regions with that in a feature bandpass .",
    "we use the definition from @xcite for [ oii ] , in which the feature bandpass ranges from 3718  to 3738  and the continuua regions have width 65 adjacent to the line region on either side .      in figure  [",
    "fig : zoiicomp ] we compare the redshift and ew [ ] measurements obtained from the ldss2 spectra and the cnoc2 spectra , for objects in common to both surveys .",
    "it can be seen that the redshifts from the two surveys are generally in good agreement . out of 35 galaxies with redshifts from both sources ,",
    "only four of the redshifts are discrepant .",
    "three of these are faint objects ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) .",
    "we also examine the combined spectral signal ( total counts , _ cts _ ) from the wavelength ranges @xmath45@xmath46  and @xmath47@xmath48  which span the most efficient region of the grism , eliminating the strong night sky lines ( as used to examine targets for which no redshifts were measured in appendix  [ sec : zincompl ] ) .",
    "these three objects all fall in the low signal range ( @xmath49 ) along with 8 of the remaining 32 galaxies in the combined sample .",

    ", we choose to relax the projected trimming radius for group members in our redefined group sample . in effect , we find that relaxing this parameter allows the more compact groups to retain the same membership whilst other groups gain extra members .    although defining the contents of a group is a subjective problem , there exist some tools which make the task easier .",

    "interlopers in redshift space are difficult to identify and eliminate , so we choose a conservative line - of - sight trimming radius of twice the velocity dispersion .",

    "despite the greater depth and spectroscopic completeness achieved in the region of the groups with our magellan targetting , it was still necessary to adopt a sparse sampling strategy due to the high density of targets , especially close to our new magnitude limit of @xmath130 . in this section ,",
    "we investigate the selection functions for the spectroscopic sample , seeking a representative means of stacking the data .",
    "the cnoc2 photometric catalogue is complete to @xmath131 and so the probability that we possess a redshift of any galaxy brighter than this limit can be easily understood . in section  [ sec : seleffects ] we assume that our magellan data reach sufficient depth to be unbiased at magnitudes @xmath132 .",
    "we then describe a simple weighting scheme which accounts for targetting bias in both cnoc2 and magellan spectroscopic samples .",
    "this scheme differentiates between galaxies with redshifts from each source which have different selection functions . in section  [ sec : zincompl ] we test our assumption of unbiased redshift completeness in the magellan data and show that this assumption holds within the limits of tests using current data .        to understand the selection functions for the spectroscopic sample , it must first be split into its component cnoc2 and magellan subsets as selection depends critically on the observing strategies and facilities used .",
    "target selection in the cnoc2 spectroscopic survey was primarily dependent upon apparent @xmath102-band magnitude .",
    "however , below the nominal spectroscopic limit of @xmath133 in that survey , galaxies with redshifts become biased towards strong ew[oii ] with respect to those obtained using magellan . in contrast target selection with magellan",
    "is dependent upon both magnitude and angular distance from the targetted group centre .",
    "however there appears to be no strong bias towards emission redshifts brighter than our magnitude limit of @xmath41 ( see section  [ sec : zincompl ] ) .",
    "therefore we can implement a simple weighting scheme which simulates a @xmath134 per cent complete survey and removes targetting bias and cnoc2 redshift incompleteness bias simultaneously :    the weighting scheme requires a radial selection function and a magnitude - dependent selection function .",
    "for each galaxy in the spectroscopic sample , a radial weight @xmath135 and a magnitude - dependent weight , @xmath136 are computed in such a way that the total weight of all galaxies with redshifts ( measured - z galaxies ) @xmath137 , the total number of galaxies in the photometric sample brighter than @xmath41 .",
    "we denote galaxies with redshifts from the original cnoc2 survey with the suffix @xmath138 and those with magellan ldss2 redshifts with the suffix @xmath139 .",
    "we begin by looking at the radial selection function , @xmath140 .",
    "the fraction of galaxies with cnoc2 redshifts shows no significant dependence upon angular distance from the centre of the nearest group and so we choose @xmath141 for all these galaxies .",
    "however there is a strong dependence on angular radius for the fraction of magellan redshifts ( or magellan targets ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : radcompl ] , the fraction of galaxies in the cnoc2 photometric catalogue ( @xmath142 ) targetted by magellan , @xmath143 ( triangles ) , where redshifts were obtained , @xmath144 ( filled circles ) and including the fraction with cnoc2 redshifts , @xmath145 ( diamonds ) is shown as a function of angular radius .",
    "most untargetted galaxies lie in the magnitude range @xmath146 .",
    "we apply a final cut to stacked data at 240 which is the approximate limiting radius for ldss2 targetting .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath98mpc at the low redshift end of our sample , @xmath109 .",
    "the linear spline through the filled circles ( @xmath144 ) represents the radial selection function @xmath144 from which the value of @xmath140 is linearly interpolated for any galaxy targetted with magellan . for these galaxies ,",
    "the radial weight is then simply computed to be @xmath147 , normalised so that galaxies located at the group centre receive a weighting @xmath148 .",
    "we note that a galaxy at 240  receives a weighting of @xmath149 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : magcompl ] , we show the magnitude - dependent selection function .",
    "galaxies are limited to within 240  and galaxies with redshifts are weighted by @xmath135 . as in figure  [ fig : radcompl ] , we plot the fraction of galaxies with magellan redshifts , @xmath150 ( filled circles ) and the fraction with magellan or cnoc2 redshifts , @xmath151 ( diamonds ) .",
    "@xmath136 must weight the galaxies such that @xmath137 in each magnitude bin and the combined weight of all galaxies must accurately emulate the properties of the entire galaxy population . in each bin of magnitude",
    "we normalise the total weighted fraction of cnoc2 redshifts to be equal to the fraction of cnoc2 redshifts in the unweighted sample , @xmath152 .",
    "we know that in the entire population , that fraction at least will have the properties of cnoc2 spectroscopic galaxies , regardless of cnoc2 redshift incompleteness .",
    "magellan targets come from the remaining galaxies without cnoc2 redshifts ( ignoring a tiny comparison sample ) and these have properties typical of that population at any given magnitude ( based upon our assumption of unbiased redshift completeness in the magellan data - see section  [ sec : zincompl ] )",
    ". therefore the remainder of the combined weight required to match the total number of galaxies in any magnitude bin ( @xmath153 ) is spread amongst the galaxies with magellan redshifts .",
    "thus @xmath136 is computed independently for galaxies with cnoc2 redshifts and magellan redshifts using equations  [ eqn : wmagczn ] and  [ eqn : wmaglzn ] , below ( which simplify to equations  [ eqn : wmagczs ] and  [ eqn : wmaglzs ] ) .",
    "we note that each quantity is computed at a given @xmath154-band magnitude ( or across each magnitude bin ) .",
    "we note from figure  [ fig : magcompl ] that in the magnitude bin at @xmath162 the fraction of galaxies with redshifts is down to @xmath163 per cent .",
    "however , it is at magnitudes below @xmath164 that the magellan data comes to dominate the statistics and the greater depth of the larger telescope allows us to achieve unbiased and highly successful redshift determination down to @xmath41 .",
    "this fainter galaxy population is expected to be more star forming than the brighter population in the local universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore by reaching this depth , we can begin to probe the evolution of group galaxy properties since intermediate redshift significantly below @xmath165 to reach this interesting population of mainly star forming galaxies .",
    "to investigate redshift incompleteness in the galaxies targetted with magellan , we examine the distribution of targetted galaxies in colour - magnitude ( @xmath166 ) space ( figure  [ fig : colmagzcompl ] ) .",
    "if there were a bias associated with preferentially losing absorption - line ( early - type ) galaxies , then one would expect those galaxies for which we could not measure redshifts to be clustered mainly towards the red end of the colour range . in figure",
    "[ fig : colmagzcompl ] we compare the colour and magnitude distributions of objects for which we could not measure redshifts ( bottom panel - hereafter referred to as lost objects ) with those for which we have emission redshifts ( top panel ) and absorption redshifts ( centre panel ) .",
    "we restrict this analysis to fainter than @xmath167 where not all targets are successful .",
    "open symbols represent objects with redshifts outside our range of interest , @xmath3 or below the luminosity range considered in the analysis , @xmath168 .",
    "lost objects are not concentrated in the red ( @xmath169 ) , absorption redshift dominated region , as might be expected if we were preferentially losing absorption line ( @xmath20 early type ) galaxies .",
    "indeed , the lost galaxies are spread quite evenly across the full colour range , suggesting no colour bias due to redshift - incompleteness ( and thus no bias in star forming properties ) .",
    "nonetheless , we are cautious in evaluating any such bias as it will impact directly upon our results . therefore we perform two further checks .",
    "the first check involves making a detailed analysis of the lost objects .",
    "we begin by making a manual examination of the spectra for the 19 lost objects with magnitudes @xmath170 .",
    "six of these objects are stars misclassified as galaxies and are removed from the catalogue . a further 10 of the objects have noisy , low signal spectra , which could represent low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies or astrometric offsets from the brightest galaxy regions .",
    "most of these objects have extended morphology , as assessed from the cnoc2 imaging .",
    "we also characterize the objects by measuring the signal in a significant part of the spectrum .",
    "we measure the combined signal ( total counts , _ cts _ ) from the wavelength ranges @xmath45@xmath46  and @xmath47@xmath48  which span the most efficient region of the grism , eliminating the strong night sky lines . from 13 lost objects with @xmath171 , there are 8 stars , 1 quasar , 1 bl lac , 1 lsb galaxy , 1 highly noisy spectrum and 1 unclassifiable object . in the low signal range ,",
    "most objects with @xmath172 are lost , although there are also some relatively low signal to noise galaxies with clear absorption redshifts .",
    "finally , lost objects in the intermediate @xmath173 range tend to have noisy spectra , often lacking emission lines .",
    "however , all blue galaxies ( @xmath174 ) with redshifts in this region possess emission lines and so it seems possible that the blue lost objects in this region lie at low redshift where [ oii ] falls out of the spectral window . alternatively , it is possible that those galaxies without redshift do not for some reason possess emission lines despite their blue colours .",
    "however , red ( @xmath175 ) lost objects with this signal range simply appear noisier and with less obvious absorption features than their counterparts with redshifts .",
    "the second check involves computing a redshift incompleteness weight , @xmath176 which is computed by distributing the weight of the lost object across its five nearest neighbours with redshifts in colour ( @xmath177 ) - magnitude ( @xmath154 ) space .",
    "nearest neighbours are computed by equating 1 magnitude in @xmath154 to 0.5 magnitudes in colour .",
    "then the combined weight of each galaxy is computed to be @xmath178 .",
    "we note that @xcite have performed a similar correction to compensate for galaxies in their sample for which they could not obtain redshifts . in figure",
    "[ fig : fpmagnoz ] we show the fraction of passive galaxies in the sample @xmath110 ( at @xmath179 ) as a function of apparent magnitude @xmath154 without applying this additional weight @xmath176 ( solid line ) with statistical errors computed using the jackknife method .",
    "we show how this uncorrected version changes when we apply the redshift incompleteness weight ( @xmath176 ) to all galaxies ( dashed line ) and when we apply it to red galaxies only ( @xmath180 , dotted line ) .",
    "the latter correction assumes that all lost blue galaxies lie outside our redshift range whilst lost red galaxies are lost simply due to low signal to noise spectra .",
    "this is the most biased scenario we can imagine , yet even in the faintest bin , the difference made to @xmath110 is comparable with the statistical error .",
    "therefore we consider the ldss2 redshift incompleteness to be unbiased at @xmath181 , to the best of our knowledge ."
