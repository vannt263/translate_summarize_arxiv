    "in general this energy changes if we rotate one of the cylinders with respect to the other and thus leads to a torque between the cylinders .",
    "this shift can be described by an angular rotation , @xmath9 , of the corrugations on the inner cylinder as @xmath10 and the corresponding torque will be @xmath11    we observe that due to rotational symmetry there will be no torque between two uncorrugated cylinders . further , using the same argument there will be no torque when only one of the cylinders has corrugations on it . in light of these observations",
    "it is helpful to write the total casimir energy for two corrugated concentric cylinders in the form @xmath12 where , @xmath13 is the energy of the configuration when the corrugations are absent on both the cylinders , @xmath14 is the additional contribution to the casimir energy when one of the cylinders is uncorrugated , and @xmath15 is the contribution to the energy which is present only when both cylinders are corrugated .",
