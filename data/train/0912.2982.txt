    "we try to find changes in the properties of grbs at different redshifts which could be related to source evolution .",
    "we consider all the 149 events detected by swift  @xcite ,  @xcite between january 26 , 2005 and july 15 , 2009 for which the redshift has been at least tentatively measured .",
    "we use the table given at the heasarc website .",
    "figure 1 shows the histogram of all grb redshifts detected until july 15 , 2009 .",
    "data for figure 1 were taken from the above quoted website and from gcn .",
    "we also show the histogram for events detected by hete-2 and _ beppo_sax , although the trigger criteria were not the same for all three experiments .",
    "the swift table gives also the bat fluence ( 15 - 150 kev ) and the bat t@xmath1 ( 15 - 350 kev ) .",
    "we consider both the values in the observer s frame and the ones converted in the restframe .",
    "the redshift in the events goes from 0.0331 to 8.26 .",
    "note that the lowest value of the redshift until now is 0.0085 for grb980425 , detected by _",

    "the scatter diagrams of those quantities , namely bat t@xmath1 and fluence , are shown in figures 2 and 4 respectively , both in the observer s and in the restframe . for lack of some data only a total of 139 events could actually be used . for comparison",
    "we also show t@xmath1 versus redshift ( figure 3 ) and fluence versus redshift ( figure 5 ) as obtained using the gamma ray burst monitor ( grbm )  @xcite , on board of _",
    "beppo_sax ( energy bands : @xmath2 kev for t@xmath1 and 40700 kev for fluence ) and french gamma - ray telescope ( fregate )  @xcite , on board of hete-2 ( energy bands : 680 kev for t@xmath1 and 230 kev for fluence ) .    as noted by dr .",

    "low t@xmath1low fluence \" events at @xmath3 and @xmath4 , but unfortunately the number of grbs is still too small to allow us to confirm this possibility .",
    "we recall that , for example , in the case of quasars the periodicity of redshifts is a problem which has been debated for many years  @xcite .    as shown in figure  [ sw_z - ttrtrmed - fig ] , we also tried to compensate for the fact that the values , taken at the same energy range in the observer s frame , originate from different energy ranges in the event s restframe .",
    "t@xmath1 in the restframe is the observed value divided by @xmath5 and the fluence in the restframe is the observed value multiplied by @xmath5 , but their respective energy intervals in the restframe are also multiplied by @xmath5 . by using the fenimore  @xcite correlation between peak duration and energy , and assuming that it can be applied also to t@xmath1 , we try to take into account that , for long bursts , the duration normally decreases with energy .    in figure 7",
    "we show the scatter diagram of fluence versus t@xmath1 , again in the observer s and restframe for the swift events , color coded for six redshift intervals .",
    "we also computed the fluence ",

    "we considered 139 grbs at different redshifts , all of them detected by the same experiment , swift - bat , hoping to find proof of evolution with @xmath9 . except for",
    "the well known two groups of  short \" and  long \" grbs , which appear to be a little less well defined in the restframe , no such proof is evident .",
    "we can see from the plots ( figures 2 and 4 ) that the number of events obviously becomes smaller with redshift , but both t@xmath1 and fluence hardly change in their average log value , where we find them also for the events at the largest redshifts .",
    "thus we conclude that the probability of having grb with those values is higher , even at large @xmath9 .",
    "we conclude that no redshift selection or evolution can yet be inferred from our plots .",
    "even grb090423 , the one detected at the largest @xmath9 until now , lies just in the middle of the distribution in the observer s restframe .",
    "not surprisingly , it is evident from the restframe plots ( figure 7 , right panel ) that fluence increases with t@xmath1 practically for all redshifts .",
    "bursts at large redshifts have higher fluences , but we must remember that they originate from higher energy ranges and that detection thresholds favor distant intense events .    9 salvaterra , r. , et al .",
