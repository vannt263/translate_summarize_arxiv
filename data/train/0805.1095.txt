    "as was pointed out by horowitz and ross @xcite , in some static  space - times , although all curvature invariants are everywhere finite , including the event horizon , an extended body falling into the experiences enormous tidal forces in the immediate vicinity of the horizon .",
    "large tidal forces emerge because in some cases the curvature components in a freely falling reference frame are significantly enhanced as compared with their static values .",
    "these objects were termed [ 1 , 2 ] `` naked '' because the behavior of tidal forces at the horizon resembles that near naked singularities .",
    "examples of this behavior have been found in a wide class of theories of gravity including supergravities that arise in the low - energy limit of string theory .",
    "refs . @xcite",
    "further classified such  and the corresponding event horizons as simply `` naked '' and `` truly naked '' ones : in the former , tidal forces experienced by a freely falling body are enhanced with respect to the static frame but remain finite . in the latter , the tidal forces become infinite .",
    "these properties depend on the asymptotic behavior of the curvature tensor near the horizon .",
    "it should be noted that , despite the same physical idea behind the notion of a naked horizon in refs.@xcite and @xcite , the particular criteria are different .",
    "namely , refs.@xcite considered a number of examples of  solutions of dilaton gravity , supergravities etc . and showed that tidal forces near the horizon can become arbitrarily large as one approaches some ( singular ) limit in the parameter space of the corresponding solution , whereas the curvature invariants remain finite and become infinite only when the above limit is reached .",
    "the criterion used in @xcite is more formal : a horizon is called naked if some quantity , characterizing the tidal forces at the horizon , is zero in the static reference frame but is finite and nonzero in a freely falling reference frame .",
    "( such horizons , from the viewpoint of @xcite , may be characterized as `` potentially naked '' since the tidal forces can really become very large at some values of the solution parameters . )",
    "this definition is much more convenient for general studies and classification of horizons in different  solutions , and , using it , horizons in  metrics were divided in @xcite into three classes : usual , naked and truly naked .",
    "the classification was formulated in terms of the near - horizon behavior of the metric in the curvature ( schwarzschild - like ) coordinates .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the extensibility of the metrics beyond horizons of different kinds .",
    "we show that the metric can be analytically ( or at least sufficiently smoothly ) extended under some stringent conditions which are explicitly written .",
    "all  metrics , for which the extensions are well - known , certainly satisfy these conditions .",
    "it turns out , however , that all `` truly naked '' horizons , as well as many of those previously characterized as naked and even usual ones , do not admit an extension and therefore must be considered as singularities .",
    "indeed , timelike and null geodesic incompleteness is generally regarded as a criterion for the presence of a singularity ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , used , in particular , in the well - known singularity theorems . and",
    "it is precisely such incompleteness that takes place at inextensible horizons ( sometimes also called `` singular horizons '' ) , despite finite values of the curvature invariants .",
    "our approach is thus somewhat complementary to the discussion on singularities in black hole physics conducted in refs .",
    "@xcite    it is natural to extend the consideration to the cosmological counterparts of  configurations , i.e. , ( ks ) cosmological models .",
    "it can be mentioned that ks cosmologies are not excluded by modern observations if one assumes their sufficiently early isotropization @xcite , and the latter may follow from the process of matter creation from vacuum  see a discussion and some estimates in @xcite .",
    "it is also known @xcite that if the matter content of the universe satisfies the null energy condition , then the only way of avoiding a cosmological singularity in the past of a ks cosmology is the beginning of the cosmological evolution from a killing horizon .",
    "thus there is a good reason for studying the properties of such horizons , and some of them are described here .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "ii contains some general relations for  metrics , needed in the further study .",
    "iii discusses the properties of the so - called quasiglobal coordinate as a convenient tool for studying the extensibility problem . in sec .",
    "iv we obtain the horizon extensibility conditions in terms of an arbitrary radial coordinate and , using the curvature coordinate @xmath0 , compare the extensibility criterion with the previously given @xcite classification of horizons as usual , naked and truly naked ones in  space - times .",
    "v contains a number of examples showing which kinds of matter can create configurations with different kinds of horizons , including tnhs . in sec .",
    "vi we discuss horizons in ks cosmologies and present the extensibility conditions in terms of an arbitrary time coordinate and proper ( synchronous ) time .",
    "vii contains some concluding remarks , in particular , on different kinds of singularities in  configurations of matter with negative pressure .",
    "the general  metric can be written in the form [ ds ] ds^2 = ^2(r ) dt^2 - ^2(r ) dr^2 - r^2(r ) d^2 , d^2 d ^2 + ^2 d^2 , where @xmath1 is an arbitrary radial coordinate .",
    "the most frequently used curvature ( schwarzschild ) coordinate corresponds to the `` gauge '' condition @xmath2 .",
    "another useful choice is the so - called quasiglobal radial coordinate @xmath3 , corresponding to the `` gauge '' @xmath4 , so that the metric is [ ds - u ] ds^2 = a(u ) dt^2 - - r^2(u ) d^2 .",
    "the nonzero components of the riemann tensor in the above two gauges are [ riem ] r^01_01 -a  = -^-- ( _ r ^-)_r = -k_1 ; r^02_02 - = -^-2 = -k_2 = r^03_03 ; r^12_12 - a- = ^-2 = -k_3 = r^13_13 ; r^23_23 ( 1- ar^2 ) = ( ^-2 - 1 ) = - k_4 , where expressions for the metric ( [ ds - u ] ) are given in each line after the first equality sign and those for the curvature coordinates [ ( [ ds ] ) with @xmath5 after the second equality sign . the prime stands for @xmath6 and the subscript @xmath0 for @xmath7 .    as follows from the geodesic deviation equations , the tidal forces experienced by bodies in the gravitational field ( [ ds ] )",
    "are conveniently characterized by the quantities @xcite z : = r^12_12 - r^02_02 = k_2 - k_3 [ z ] in the static reference frame and ~^-2 z = z / a [ tz ] in a freely falling reference frame near a horizon .",
    "these quantities have been used in @xcite to distinguish usual , naked and truly naked horizons .",
    "assuming @xmath8 in the metric ( [ ds - u ] ) , we obtain a  ( ks ) cosmology in which @xmath9 is a quasiglobal time coordinate and @xmath10 acquires a spatial nature .",

    "the tidal forces acting on bodies at rest in the metric ( [ ks - u ] ) or ( [ ks - tau ] ) ( comoving observers ) are characterized by the same quantity ( [ z ] ) , as before , while forces acting near a candidate horizon ( @xmath17 ) on a noncomoving geodesic observer are proportional to @xmath18 .",
    "it is easy to see that the components ( [ riem ] ) or ( [ riem - t ] ) coincide with the corresponding tetrad components of the riemann tensor and behave as scalars under radial or time coordinate changes .",
    "the quantities @xmath19 and @xmath20 also possess this property .",

    "r^ = 4k_1 ^ 2 + 8k_2 ^ 2 + 8k_3 ^ 2 + 4k_4 ^ 2 , and it is clear that all algebraic curvature invariants are finite ( i.e. , a curvature singularity is absent ) at a given point if and only if all the components ( [ riem ] ) or ( [ riem - t ] ) are finite .",
    "to study the extensibility of the metric beyond the surfaces that have been previously termed naked or truly naked horizons , it proves helpful to write the metric in the form ( [ ds - u])or ( [ ks - u ] ) because the coordinate @xmath9 is distinguished by the following properties @xcite :    ( i ) : :    it always takes a finite value @xmath23 at a killing    horizon @xmath24 across which an extension is possible ; ( ii ) : :    near a horizon , the increment @xmath25 is a multiple    ( with a nonzero constant factor ) of the corresponding increments of    manifestly well - behaved kruskal - type null coordinates , used for    analytic extension of the metric across the horizon . therefore , with    this coordinate ,",

    "a direct inspection shows that it is really possible to avoid infinite tidal forces at a tnh by properly choosing a non - geodesic path .",

    "the calculations are carried out separately for the cases when the proper distance to the horizon is finite or infinite ( the details will be presented elsewhere ) .",
    "the resulting infinite acceleration can be viewed as one more manifestation of a really singular nature of tnhs .",
    "an important point is , however , that a singular nature of many horizons in the sense of extensibility is not directly related to their `` truly naked '' character : we have seen that many horizons which do not create large or infinite tidal forces , are still inextensible .",
    "a reason for that evidently consists in the properties of matter in the near - horizon region , incompatible with analyticity of the functions @xmath75 and @xmath96 .",
    "a phenomenon of interest in ks cosmologies is the opportunity to receive information in the form of massive or massless particles from an epoch beyond a past horizon ( if any ) , even though such a horizon could occur infinitely long ago according to our clocks . in reality",
    ", all such particles would be probably absorbed at a subsequent hot stage of the universe evolution ; but the existence of their traces in observable phenomena , e.g. , in cmb properties , should not be excluded .    in the context of the early universe , in addition to particle creation , it would be of interest to take into account one more quantum phenomenon , the dynamical casimir effect related to the nontrivial topology of ks models , e.g. , in the manner of refs.@xcite , and its possible influence on the structure of singularities like those discussed in this paper",
    ".    it would also be of interest to relate the origin of singularities in ks cosmology subject to quantum effects with their effective 2d description , in the manner of @xcite , where quantum - corrected ks cosmologies were investigated .",
    "the effective 2d description makes the presentation qualitatively easier and may reveal a fundamental structure behind singularities , related to quantum effects .",
    "the singular horizons in ks cosmology discussed in this paper ( at least simple ones ) may be considered as examples of the so - called finite - time singularities .",
    "four types of such singularities are known and classified for isotropic frw models in ref.@xcite . among them , the big rip ( or type i singularity ) is the most well - known and is widely discussed in connection with different models of dark energy .",
    "it is clear that in ks models , where we have two scale factors , such singularities may occur and their properties should be more diverse , and the corresponding classification should be naturally extended as compared with the one - scale - factor frw cosmology .",
    "such an extended classification , which should also apply to static , spherically symmetric analogues of ks cosmologies as well as to other , more complicated anisotropic cosmologies , is of significant interest .",
    "let us mention some tentative results on this way .",
    "the big rip singularity in frw models consists in an infinite growth of the scale factor @xmath141 at finite proper time @xmath13 , accompanied by @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the density of matter with @xmath144 .",
    "considering such a fluid , with @xmath145 in the ks geometry ( [ ks - tau ] ) , we obtain that a big rip can also occur at finite @xmath146 but can be both isotropic and anisotropic : the volume factor @xmath73 and the density @xmath143 behave in the same way as in frw models : [ rip - ks ] v ( ) = a()r^2 ( ) ~|-_s|^2/(1+w ) , ( ) ~|- _ s|^-2 , but there can be an arbitrary ratio @xmath147 between the growth rates of @xmath141 and @xmath148 , depending on initial conditions : @xmath149 . in a similar way , we can discuss singularities of other types , as is done in ref.@xcite .",
    "static analogues of the big rip exist with @xmath150 between zero and @xmath151 , in agreement with the above - mentioned @xmath152 correspondence .",
    "an opportunity of interest is that @xmath153 while @xmath154 ( a repulsive singularity on a sphere of finite radius ) as the coordinate @xmath9 in ( [ ds - u ] ) tends to a finite value @xmath155 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior is [ rip - st ] a ~(u - u_s)^-n , r r_s + r_k(u - u_s)^k , ~a^m , for a fluid with @xmath156 . here",
    ", the exponents @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 ( but @xmath160 ) are connected by the relation @xmath161 .",
