    "string theory ( st ) ( see @xcite for a review ) is at the moment the most attractive candidate for a unified description of the basic constituents in nature and their interactions . despite tremendous progress in our understanding of fundamental strings in the past decade , we are still very far from a single quantitative prediction to be observed in experiments .",
    "the main reason for this unsatisfactory state of affairs is that the natural scale in which string effects become important ( planck scale ) is much smaller than the scale we can probe in high energy scattering experiments .",
    "however , as observational cosmology provides a test of fundamental physics , since the scales of particle physics become relevant as the universe grows to its present size , the most likely arena for a confrontation between st and experiments lies in the cosmological inferences which may be measurable today . to begin with , in general relativity",
    ", singularities in curved space - times are often unavoidable . in fact",
    ", the well - known singularity theorems @xcite prove the existence of singularities under very general physical properties of the matter energy momentum tensor .",
    "for example , the standard big bang ( sbb ) scenario ( see @xcite ) exhibits an initial singularity at @xmath2 . in st",
    ", there are several reasons to believe that singularities in target space do not occur .",
    "heuristically , this belief is based on the fact that the st possesses a `` minimal length scale '' set by the extension of the string itself .",
    "one of the keys in understanding the meaning of singularities and the minimal length scale in st may be given by the so - called duality symmetry @xcite .",
    "duality symmetry is the most important string symmetry from many points of view .",
    "let us suppose we have a string propagating in a target space @xmath3 where we have set the radius of the compactified dimension equal to @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "it is a well known fact that every correlation function @xmath5 can be written as a topological expansion in the string coupling constant @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the correlator at fixed genus .",
    "duality symmetry means that @xmath5 as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath8 is invariant under the replacement @xmath9 together with an interchange between the momentum and the winding modes of the external states . in other words , we are unable to distinguish between small and large @xmath4 provided we change the string coupling properly .",
    "since no string scattering experiment is able to tell us whether we are living in a universe with size @xmath4 and string coupling constant @xmath8 or in a universe with the dual values , this defines in fact a minimal measurable length at the self - dual distance @xmath10 .",
    "the duality symmetry is not limited to flat backgrounds ; its existence was shown @xcite for curved , time - dependent backgrounds , which is of particular interest in the context of cosmological singularities @xcite .",
    "in addition to solve the initial singularity problem , a theory of everything must also be able to explain the low energy universe . in particular in describing the history of the whole space - time it must be able to make contact with the sbb in the attempt to describe properly the recent evolution of the @xmath11-dimensional manifold .",
    "the main difficulty we have to deal with is that st is defined on a @xmath12-dimensional manifold ( with @xmath13 or @xmath14 for the bosonic and supersymmetric version respectively ) while we have experience of only three spatial plus one temporal dimensions .",
    "then the theory must be able to describe the decoupling of the external and internal manifold .",
    "in particular we must require @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the external 4-dimensional space - time and @xmath17 is a @xmath18-dimensional internal compact manifold with typical physical dimension of the order of planck scale .",
    "early attempts to find cosmologically interesting string scenarios able to eliminate the singularity in the early history of the universe dates back to the pioneering work of alvarez , leblanc , brandenberger and vafa , alvarez and osorio @xcite , and were based on the hypothesis of target space duality from thermodynamical considerations .",
    "more recently gasperini and veneziano @xcite and antoniadis , rizos and tamvakis @xcite proposed a different dynamical approach to the solution of the singularity problem , based on scale factor duality ( sfd ) and the solution of the string effective equations .    both thermodynamical and dynamical approaches proposed a suitable scenario in which the evolution of the scale factor is monotonic as time runs from @xmath19 to @xmath20 , while the hubble parameter is positive and _ bell shaped _ as a function of time .    in this paper , starting from dynamical considerations , we show a different , richer , non - singular scenario of string cosmology able to make contact with the sbb for the late evolution of the universe . in particular , after introducing external and internal scale factors , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we find that the evolution of @xmath0 is _ not _ monotonic ; a contraction phase is present in the early history of the universe , while the effective 4-dimensional gravitational coupling naturally converges to a constant value corresponding to the present value of newton s constant . as during the evolution of the universe",
    "there are different phases of accelerated dynamics , the scenario presented in this paper , in addition to solving the problems of the singularity and of the constancy of the fundamental constants , offers a natural framework in which to accomodate inflation ( which is the solution of the other well known problems of the sbb , i.e. horizon , flatness and structure formation ) ( see , however , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "ii we discuss the low energy string effective action and the sfd symmetry .",
    "iii is devoted to a general and qualitative description of solutions of the string field equations . in sect .",
    "iv we present the general solution to the string cosmology equations which interpolates smoothly the dual evolution of the ` pre - big - bang ' and ` post - big - bang ' phases , where here by big bang ( in low case ) we mean the epoch of transition between the two dual phases . in sect .",
    "v we summarize the main conclusions .",
    "the appendixes are devoted to the proof of the non - singular behavior of the solution reported in sect .",
    "iv , and to the representation of the same solutions in the einstein frame , respectively .",
    "let us consider the propagation of a bosonic string in the presence of a background consisting of a @xmath12-dimensional metric @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) and a dilaton @xmath23 .",
    "it is described by the two - dimensional @xmath24-model @xmath25 \\label{tdsm } \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the world - sheet metric tensor and @xmath27 is the ricci scalar constructed with @xmath26 .",
    "the requirement of conformal invariance of @xmath28 ( i.e. the vanishing of the @xmath29-functions ) leads naturally to the determination of the massless modes dynamics .",
    "in particular we have the following tree level effective action for the background fields @xcite @xmath30 a multidimensional brans - dicke ( bd ) theory . the cosmological constant represents the central charge deficit of the theory , @xmath31 depending on details of particular st ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 in the bosonic version , @xmath34 , @xmath35 in the supersymmetric version ) . the effective action ( [ lesea ] ) leads to the following equations of motion    [ lesfe ] @xmath36    ( @xmath37 is the covariant derivative and @xmath38 is the @xmath12-dimensional dalambertian ) .",
    "now , it is known @xcite that if the metric and dilaton fields do not depend on the coordinate @xmath39 , the field equations ( [ lesfe ] ) are invariant under the sfd transformation    [ sfdt ] @xmath40    the non - trivial duality tranformation behavior of the dilaton field implies that the coordinate - dependent string coupling constant is trasformed like @xmath41 .",
    "this change of the string coupling constant agrees with the transformation of @xmath42 in the static case ( equation ( [ cfds ] ) ) when one considers the genus expansion of the string partition function @xcite .",
    "this transformation is just a particular case of a more general global @xmath43 covariance of the theory @xcite : @xmath43 covariance means that , if the theory is independent of @xmath44 spatial coordinates , the dilaton tranforms as @xmath45 and the components of the metric and of the antisymmetric tensors mix according to @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 are matrix representations of the @xmath51 spatial part of the metric and antisymmetric tensor , in the basis where the @xmath43 metric is off - diagonal . )    in reference @xcite it was shown that @xmath43 covariance holds even if the equations ( [ lesfe ] ) are supplemented by a phenomenological source term corresponding to bulk string matter .",
    "the importance of sfd in the context of string cosmology is that , when combined with time reversal ( the most obvious symmetry of the theory ) , it allows us to associate at every phase of ` post - big - bang ' evolution ( for @xmath52 ) a dual phase , called ` pre - big - bang ' @xcite , ( @xmath53 ) with a completely different dynamics for the fields .",
    "in fact sfd is not a simple reparametrization of the fields , nor are its implications trivial .",
    "for example , if we start with a scale factor @xmath0 that is expanding , the dual scenario @xmath54 describes a contracting universe . when combined with time reversal , sfd maps , for example , a background with decreasing curvature to the dual one characterized by a curvature that is increasing .",
    "finally it is important to stress the necessity of the presence of the dilaton for sfd to be a symmetry of the low energy string effective action .",
    "in fact for @xmath55 the action ( [ lesea ] ) reduces to conventional general relativity , and we are left simply with the symmetry of time reversal .",
    "only the existence of the dilaton field and its non trivial behavior under sfd ( equation ( [ sfdt ] ) ) allows us to realize the transformation @xmath56 .",
    "to make contact with observational cosmology , we take the @xmath12-dimensional space - time as a direct product of the external pseudo - riemannian manifold @xmath57 with an @xmath58-dimensional compact riemannian manifold @xmath59 . we take for @xmath57 a flat friedman - robertson - walker space - time with scale factor @xmath0 , and we assume that the dilaton field @xmath23 and the radius @xmath60 of the internal space ( which we take to be an @xmath61-torus ) depend only on the temporal coordinate : @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) . with these choices for the fields and adding a source term representing a primordial string gas with energy momentum tensor @xmath64 the field equations ( [ lesfe ] ) ( with @xmath65 ) which now change in    [ lesfem ]",
    "@xmath66    can be written as    [ rfe ] @xmath67    here we have introduced the hubble parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 for the external and internal space respectively and we have denoted with barred symbols the @xmath70-invariant expressions for the dilaton and the matter energy density , while for the pressures @xmath71 and @xmath72 . ]",
    "@xmath73 ( we also introduce @xmath74 and @xmath75 . ) to solve the system ( [ rfe ] ) we must introduce an equation of state for the source term of the form @xmath76 with , at the moment , @xmath77 and @xmath78 arbitrary functions of time .    introducing a coordinate time @xmath79 defined by @xmath80 ( @xmath81 is an arbitrary constant of dimension of length )",
    "the forementioned equations can be integrated @xcite to obtain ( @xmath82 )    [ equat ] @xmath83    where @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 are arbitrary constants and @xmath87 is negative .    from ( [ equat b ] ) , to have a positive definite energy density we must require @xmath88 ; also",
    "the zeroes of @xmath89 correspond to singularities for the fields .",
    "let us consider the simplest case @xmath90 and @xmath91 , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are constants .",
    "the general solution of ( [ equat ] ) @xcite in a form convenient to our discussion reads    [ gss ] @xmath94 \\left| ( \\xi -\\xi_+ ) ( \\xi - \\xi_- ) \\right|^{(\\epsilon -2)/\\epsilon } \\left| { \\xi - \\xi_+ \\over \\xi -\\xi_- } \\right|^{-2\\sigma_0 } \\,,\\label{gss f}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath95^{1/2 } \\right\\ } \\,,\\ ] ] are the two _ real _ zeroes of @xmath89 and @xmath96 other solutions of the system ( [ rfe ] ) are also obtained from ( [ gss ] ) through sfd .",
    "the internal and external hubble parameters have two singularities , at @xmath97 and at @xmath98 . for @xmath99 ( necessary",
    "condition to have a positive energy density today ) the range @xmath100 is not physical because here @xmath101 becomes negative .",
    "the evolution of the scale factors depends strongly on the relative sign of @xmath102 and @xmath103 , and of @xmath104 and @xmath105 ; but in any case singularities are always present in the curvature , contrary to what stressed in @xcite in the context of brans - dicke theory . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we report a qualitative representation of a generic scale factor for @xmath106 and @xmath107 , where @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "for the solutions found in sect . iii the growth of curvature , of the effective coupling @xmath110 and of the effective energy density @xmath111 , are unbounded , which is inacceptable in the light of the discussion of sect .",
    "i and to phenomenological constraints on the graviton spectrum discussed in @xcite .",
    "the problem is then to find a smooth transition from the pre - big - bang phase to the post - big - bang one . for this purpose",
    "we exploit a suggestion of gasperini and veneziano @xcite .    in the vicinity of the planck",
    "scale the low energy string effective action ( [ lesea ] ) does not apply ; we expect some modifications . to preserve the symmetry under sfd we must require that these corrections are themselves invariant .",
    "following @xcite we introduce a self - dual dilaton potential @xmath112 .",
    "the new field equations can be still reduced to the form ( [ equat ] ) , but with @xmath113 which , unlike ( [ bet ] ) , is no longer necessarily negative . for @xmath99 ( positivity of the source energy density )",
    "it is then possible to choose @xmath114 and large such that @xmath89 does not have zeroes in the real field ( a proof is given in appendix a ) .",
    "this implies that there are no singularities in the curvature , nor in the effective coupling , nor in the effective energy density .    to solve the system ( [ equat ] )",
    "we must assign the equation of state of the source term .",
    "being interested in solutions which describe a smooth transition from the pre - big - bang era ( @xmath115 ) to the dual post - big - bang ( @xmath116 ) it is worth looking for self - dual solutions , and in order to obtain them , as @xmath79 goes through zero , the external and internal pressures must change sign , @xcite .",
    "so @xmath117 and @xmath118 must be odd functions of @xmath79 .",
    "from phenomenological considerations we must also impose the constraint of stationariety of the functions @xmath77 and @xmath78 for large values of @xmath119 . then",
    ", if we introduce the vector of pressure @xmath120 , we must require @xmath121 ( @xmath122 and @xmath123 constants ) with a smooth transition between the two phases .",
    "it is evident that these properties are shared by a vast class of functions .",
    "for example , any of the choices @xmath124 with @xmath125 arbitrary , smooth , odd and asymptotically monotonic function of @xmath79 , would do .",
    "but , since , from a qualitative point of view @xcite , the result is independent of the form of the functions @xmath126 for fixed @xmath127 , for mathematical simplicity , we choose ( as in @xcite ) @xmath128 with @xmath129 constants .    equations ( [ equat ] ) can be solved analytically if @xmath130 and @xmath131 . in place of the singular solutions ( [ gss ] ) we obtain now @xcite    [ unsol ] @xmath132    where @xmath133 and @xmath134 has been defined in ( [ epsi ] ) . for the scale factors ,",
    "as we are unable to give analytical expressions , we have proceeded to numerical integrations . in any case",
    "a qualitative information can be easily obtained from the relative hubble parameters . in particular ,",

    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "these solutions generalize in a non - trivial way the ones obtained in @xcite .",
    "the latter , in fact , can be easily recovered if we set @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "the presence of a contraction phase , very suggestive in itself , has interesting consequences on the present structure of the observable universe .",
    "it was recently stressed in @xcite that every kind of accelerated evolution , whether during expansion or contraction , naturally solves the kinematical problems of the sbb . moreover , when expressed in terms of conformal time , the contraints for successful inflation are the same for expansion and contraction",
    ". then our solution offers a natural scenario capable of solving the flatness , horizon and structure formation problems of sbb , without introducing an _ ad hoc _ inflaton .",
    "as for the number of e - folds of accelerated contraction , we have @xmath143 with @xmath144 the negative zero of @xmath145 and the integrand @xmath146 .",
    "although the latter integral can not be performed analytically , it can be seen that @xmath147 has the same shape of @xmath145 and , for the period of accelerated contraction , a very good fitting is a linear interpolation ( we have a correlation coefficient @xmath148 ) .",
    "then we get for the linear fitting function @xmath149 in the range @xmath150 $ ] @xmath151 and @xmath152 where @xmath153 we can choose @xmath102 and @xmath104 to tune @xmath154 to any desired value . but",
    "the contraction phase is not the only period of accelerated evolution of the external space . for @xmath155",
    "= -1 $ ] three different phases of accelerated evolution ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) follow each other during the early history of the universe . then , in addition to solving naturally the kinematical problems typical of the sbb , from the point of view of structure formation , our scenario gives rise to a sort of multiple inflation ( but with a single field ) capable of breaking the scale invariance of the fluctuation power spectrum , a possible solution to the problem of large scale power in galaxy distribution @xcite .",
    "furthemore , in order to make contact with observational cosmology , in addition to explaining why the universe is flat , the entropy is so high , etc .",
    ", we must also be able to explain why the fundamental constants are effectively constants .",
    "in fact in string cosmology the gravitational coupling is dynamical .",
    "when reducing the theory from @xmath12 to four dimensions , we get that the 4-dimensional `` newton s constant '' is proportional to the inverse of the volume of the internal space times the inverse of the coupling between the scalar field and the ricci scalar ( @xmath156 ) : in general , the latter expression is hardly constant , while newton s constant must be `` constant '' at least from nucleosynthesis onward @xcite .",
    "really this is the most difficult problem in multi - dimensional and scalar - tensor theories .",
    "if we look at the asymptotic behavior of solutions ( [ unsol ] ) , then we can realize that our scenario has just this additional bonus .",
    "it is in fact easy to see that for very large @xmath79 we have    [ asyms ] @xmath157    and @xmath158 then for a universe with radiation in the external space @xmath159 , @xmath160 becomes asymptotically constant ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "what is really surprising is that newton s constant stabilizes _",
    "indipendently _ of the dynamics of the internal space , which asymptotically can expand ( for @xmath161 ) , contract ( for @xmath162 ) or approach a constant value ( for @xmath163 ; the most attractive possibility ) . for what concerns the asymptotic dynamics of the external space , the choice @xmath164 naturally leads to the typical behavior of radiation dominated model : @xmath165 .",
    "the same asymptotic scenario is shared also by the singular solutions ( [ gss ] ) , because the dilaton potential strongly modifies the field s dynamics only around @xmath166 , becoming rapidly uninfluential as @xmath79 grows .",
    "the combination of einstein s general theory of relativity and of the copernican principle naturally leads to the formulation of the sbb .",
    "although in the last decades the sbb has been strongly confirmed by astronomical observations , it still presents some `` conceptual '' difficulties : the existence of an initial singularity and the well known kinematical problems ( horizon , flatness , structure formation ) .",
    "it is a common belief that these problems can be solved when a consistent quantum theory of gravitation will be formulated .",
    "today st seems the most plausible attempt to quantize gravity , and then it is very tempting to study its implications on the early evolution of the universe .",
    "foremost in supporting the belief that string cosmology can solve the singularity problem , is sfd symmetry , one of the most important symmetries of st .",
    "it means that if @xmath0 solves the string equations then also @xmath167 is a solution of the same dynamical system , thus introducing a minimal length scale .",
    "furthermore st modifies the commonly accepted lore : the present decelerated expansion is preceded by a dual phase in which the evolution is accelerated . the smooth passage between the two asymptotic phases",
    "may be realized by a period of accelerated contraction . because accelerated contraction is as efficient as accelerated expansion to solve the kinematical problems of the sbb , the st scenario presents multiple episodes of inflation .",
    "the last difficulty we are able to cope with is to justify the constancy of the 4-dimensional newton s constant without requiring the introduction of a mass term for the dilaton or the formulation of a least coupling principle @xcite .",
    "in fact the low energy string effective action is a multi - dimensional scalar tensor theory of gravity , presenting then a dynamical gravitational coupling .",
    "astronomical observations imply however that @xmath168 @xcite : a realistic model must describe the spontaneous stabilization of the newton s constant , which we obtain .",
    "obviously the scenario presented here is basically a toy model , which needs more theoretical support .",
    "for example we should justify the form of the dilaton potential and the equation of state for string sources in curved backgrounds .",
    "nevertheless we want to stress that some of the positive and new results presented in this paper ( presence of a primordial contraction phase , stabilization of the fundamental constants , convergence towards the sbb ) are common both to non - singular and to more conventional singular scenarios , representing then a element in favour of string cosmology .",
    "the development of the subject and the deeper study of the astrophysical implications of an early dynamical gravitational coupling and contraction phase , in addition to the spontaneous compactification of the internal dimensions , may represent a solid benchmark to test the theoretical predictions of st .    * acknowledgment *    c.a .",

    "<S> following a suggestion by gasperini and veneziano , that string cosmology can be reconciled with inflation and , hence , with the standard big bang , we display an analytical solution which possesses four interesting properties : ( 1 ) it is non - singular ; ( 2 ) it distinguishes the dynamics of the external scale factor , @xmath0 , from that of the internal one , @xmath1 ; ( 3 ) it exhibits a non - monotonic behavior of @xmath0 ; and ( 4 ) it stabilizes both newton s constant and @xmath1 ( the latter to a finite , non - vanishing value ) . </S>",
    "<S> the interest of the non - monotonic evolution of @xmath0 consists in the fact that it contains three phases of accelerated expansion , contraction and expansion before the final decelerated expansion which eventually becomes the standard big bang . </S>",
    "<S> the total number of e - folds of the three accelerated eras can be calculated and tuned to fit the requests of observational astronomy . </S>"
