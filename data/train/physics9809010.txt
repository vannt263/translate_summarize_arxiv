    "the lagurre - gaussian beam carries orbital angular momentum associated with helical surface of constant phase has recently been the subject of considerable theoretical and experimental study[1 - 7 ] .",
    "many of these studies concern the transfer of orbital angular momentum of the beam to small particals even atoms@xcite . with the developement of laser cooling and trapping of neutral atoms , various schemes to slow the atomic motion and increase the atomic intensity",
    "have been proposed and some demonstarted . in a far - off - resonant laser beam it is possible to observe the spatial variation of the optical dipole force on slow atoms . in this case",
    "the atom experiences an effective mechanical potential propotional to the intensity of the beam .",
    "recently the gaussian - laguerre modes were used as as optical potential to trap atoms@xcite .",
    "the degree of nonlinearity of the potential is characterised by the charge of the donut .",
    "the charge is an integer characterising the phase singularity of the beam on axis and which also determines the variation of the intensity off axia in the transverse plane . in the case of unit charge",
    "the intensity close to the axis varies quadratically with the radical distance in the transverse plane . for a charge greated than inity",
    "the variation of intensity is a quartic , or higher , power of the radical distance and thus the resulting motion near the beam axis is nonlinear . in this case",
    "the frequancy of bound oscillatory motion near the axis depends on the energy of the atom . as the energy increases",
    ", the frequency decreases , eventually falling to zero quite quickly as the unstable fixed point at the potential maximum is reached .",
    "it is well known that if such a nonlinear system is driven by a periodic modulation of the potential , chaotic dynamics can result@xcite . in this paper",
    "we will consider the motion of cold atoms in intensity modulated gaussian - lagurre ( donut ) beam and discuss the classical two dimensional chaotic dynamics for charge @xmath1 .",
    "the expression of a linearily poralized l - g beam in cylindral coordinator@xmath2 is @xcite @xmath3\\exp[{il\\phi}]\\times\\nonumber \\\\                         &    & \\exp[{i(2q+l+1)tan^{-1}(z / z_r)}]\\exp({ikz}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath4 , @xmath5 ; @xmath6 and @xmath7 for @xmath8 mode .",
    "we only concentrate on the donut beam , because it is the easiest and the most applicable way to form the optical trap , in which case it has @xmath9 and therefore @xmath10 . in reality",
    "( 1 ) can be greatly simplified because in general @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the new expression of electric field for donut beam is @xmath13\\exp({ikz}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 is the topological charge of singularity for donut beam and the sign can be positive or negative .",
    "each photon in the donut beam carrys @xmath15 orbital angular momentum for linearly polarized donut beam .",
    "the intensity distribution of the @xmath16 beam is given by@xcite @xmath17,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the power of laser .",
    "for cold atoms in far - off - resonant donut beam , the spontaneous emission can be ignored .",
    "the effective optical potential for two - level atom@xcite has the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the detuning and @xmath21 is a saturation parameter , where @xmath22 is rabi frequency , for for - off - resonant donut beam @xmath23 and thus @xmath24    taking into account the special variation of the rabi frequency , the classical hamiltonian in @xmath0 plane for the system is @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the saturation intensity , for rb atom @xmath29 .",
    "when the rabi frequency is modulated and @xmath30 is substitued by @xmath31 , the dynamics of the atom is chaotic . for the different charge @xmath14",
    ", the potential is different .",
    "the larger the value of @xmath14 , the wider the bottom of the potental . for @xmath32 , at the bottom of this potental the motion of atom is harmonic and no chaotic dynamics for periodic modulated potential can arise . only if the atom has a larger kinetic energy so that the nonlinear parts of the potential are expected , does the dynamics became chaotic . for @xmath33 ,",
    "the dynamics is nonlinear over the whole potential range and because the bottom is wider , it is easier to control the amplitude of modulation .",
    "for simplicity we discuss @xmath1 case and the practical parameters for our numerical examples are that for rb atoms , the linewidth @xmath34 , mass @xmath35 , the beam waist of laser @xmath36 , laser power @xmath37 and the detuning @xmath38",
    ". we define dimensionless parameters @xmath39 @xmath40 , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the doppler limit energy and @xmath44 is the momentum respectively . omitting the tildes and defining @xmath45 ,",
    "the hamiltonian can be rewritten for charge @xmath1 as @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "using hamiltons equations we find that the motion in the transverse plane without modulation ( @xmath48 is described by the equations ,    @xmath49    @xmath50    @xmath51    @xmath52    where @xmath53 . clearly there are twofixed points , one stable fixed point on axis ( @xmath54 ) , and one unstable fixed point at the intensity maximum ( r=1 ) .",
    "the chioce of modulation frequency @xmath55 depends on the frequency of unperturbed periodic motion . for simplicity",
    "we assume @xmath56 and @xmath57 , so the expression for @xmath58 is simplified as one dimensional hamiltanian .",
    "the motion period for unperturbed hamiltanian @xmath59 is@xcite @xmath60    where @xmath61 is determined by @xmath62 .",
    "therefore @xmath63\\}^{-1/2}dx}.\\ ] ] the graph of @xmath55 versus @xmath59 and @xmath64 versus @xmath59 can be seen in fig.2 .",
    "we can select the modulation frequency @xmath55 to control the fix points in periodic optical potential .",
    "here we set dimensionless parameter @xmath65 , which corresponds to @xmath66 .",
    "we use the symplectic integrators @xcite,@xcite to solve the equations of motion because the hamiltonian evolution preserves the poisson bracket relation @xmath67    we plot the stroboscopic potrait of the system at times @xmath68 , where s is an integer referred to as the strobe number . from figure 3,4,5",
    "we can see that with the increase of @xmath69 , the motion of atoms will appear chaos .",
    "but there are some stable regions .",
    "an initial wide spectral distribution of atoms will result in some atoms trapped in these stable regions .",
    "laser cooling and trapping techniques have the ability to cool the atom to very low velocities and trap them in very small region in momentum",
    ". therefore the appropriate description of atomic dynamics is to use probability distribution on phase space @xmath70 .",
    "we define a classical state to be a probability measure on phase space of the form @xmath71 , the density of probability satisfies the liouville equation @xmath72 where@xmath73 is the poisson bracket .",
    "the equation can be solved by the method of characteristics . to simulate the experiment , we assume initially atoms are umiformly distributed on @xmath74 and @xmath75 region , where @xmath76 is a constant choosen to ensure the major fixed points are included .",
    "the momentum distributions for @xmath77 and @xmath78 are gaussian distributions .",

    "6 shows for optical potential when it is no modulation , atoms will accumulate around the fix point@xmath84 ( fig.3 ) . when the modulation is added the atoms will diffuse but will accumulate around several rings . with the increase of modulation amplitude , more atoms accumulate around rings and less atoms around @xmath84 ( fig.7,8 ) .",
    "the variances @xmath85 and @xmath86 are taken as @xmath87 in computation , which corresponds to temperature @xmath88 and @xmath89 approximately recoil temperature .",
    "if the variance is narrower rings become clearer .",
    "in summary , we have shown that it has chaotic dynamics for mudulated far - off - detuning donut beam . for atomic momenta @xmath90 ,",
    "@xmath91 which have gaussian distributions , atoms will be trapped in rings when the optical potential is modulated .",
    "if at some moment the optical potential is withdrawn , atoms will expand freely and will keep the shape of rings becasue the momentua is symmetric in @xmath0 .",
