    "the notion of _ toric fibre product _ of two toric varieties goes back to @xcite .",

    "* conjecture 56 ) the hope was raised that when building larger graphs by glueing copies from a finite collection of graphs along a common subgraph , there might be a uniform upper bound on the markov degree of the models thus constructed , independent of how many copies of each graph are used .",

    "a straightforward generalisation of this theorem also holds , where each @xmath91 is a closed sub - scheme given by some ideal @xmath92 in the coordinate ring of @xmath93 . the notion of hadamard - stable",
    "then says that that the pull - back of @xmath92 lies in the ideal of @xmath94 , and the toric fibre product is defined in @xcite .",
