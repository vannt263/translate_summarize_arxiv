    "large - scale ( @xmath3,@xmath4 ) diagrams of hi  21-cm line emission in the galactic plane usually show faint high - velocity bumps protruding from their surroundings .",
    "these faint  wing \"- like features are extended to the velocities well beyond the maximum or minimum velocities permitted by the galactic rotation .",
    "some of those  forbidden - velocity wings ( fvws ) \" are shown in fig .",
    "[ introfig ] , which is a ( @xmath3,@xmath4 ) diagram of the galactic hi  emission in the 1st and the 2nd quadrants at @xmath5 .",
    "fvws are the ones that are small and smoothly extend from the main galactic hi  , which distinguishes them from high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) that have discrete peaks isolated from the galactic hi  .",
    "fvws are probably the sites where kinetic energies are expelled into the interstellar medium ( ism ) by some violent events .",
    "our interest about fvws was first motivated by the statistics of snrs , namely that the number of known snrs is much less than that of the expected ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter kk04 ) .",
    "the number of presently - known galactic snrs , most of which have been identified in radio continuum , is 265 according to the green s catalog @xcite , which provides a most complete and up - to - date list of identified galactic snrs .",
    "this is much less than the number ( 20  30,000 ) expected from the sn rate and the life time of snrs .",
    "therefore , most snrs are `` missing '' , and it must be mainly old snrs that are missing considering their large population .",
    "this is not surprising because old snrs are faint in radio continuum , and it is difficult to identify faint radio sources because of the confusion due to the galactic background emission and also because of observational limitations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "kk04 paid attention to the fact that an old snr consists of fast expanding hi  shell and that the shell might last after the remnant becomes too faint to be visible in radio continuum . if its expansion velocity is greater than the minimum or maximum velocities permitted by the galactic rotation , then the snr shell or part of it ( maybe the caps ) could be detected as high - velocity gas , e.g. , fvws , in fig .",
    "[ introfig ] .",
    "they proposed that the fvws could be possible candidates for the missing old snrs .",
    "indeed , @xcite have carried out high resolution hi  line observation toward fvw 190.2 + 1.1 , one of fvws in this paper , and detected a rapidly expanding ( @xmath6",
    "km s@xmath2 ) hi  shell .",
    "the parameters of this shell seem only consistent with those of the remnant of a sn explosion .",
    "this shell is not seen in any other wave band , suggesting that it represents the oldest type of snr , that is essentially invisible except via its hi  line emission .",
    "although snr is a strong candidate of fvws , the high velocities of fvws could be also produced by stars expelling their mass into the ism , e.g. , stellar winds from massive stars , and outflows from young stellar objects or asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "high- or intermediate - velocity clouds ( hvcs , ivcs ) that happen to be close to the maximum / minimum velocity of the hi  gas along the line of sight would appear as fvws , too . in order to understand the nature of fvws and their relation to old snrs , therefore , a systematic study of fvws is required .",
    "we have searched fvws in the galactic plane ( @xmath7 ) using leiden / dwingeloo hi  survey ( lds ) data and the hi  southern galactic plane survey ( sgps ) data , and studied their statistical characteristics .",
    "some of our preliminary results were published by @xcite . in section  [ secdata ]",
    ", we explain the hi  surveys used for the search and the identification procedure .",
    "the catalog of fvws is presented in section 3 , where we show their statistical properties and the result of comparison with other objects , too .",
    "possibility of fvws to be snrs and some other possible origins will be discussed in section 4 .",
    "we finally summarize our results in section 5 .",
    "we used two galactic hi  survey data ; the leiden / dwingeloo hi  survey ( lds ) @xcite and the parkes survey , which is a part of the hi  southern galactic plane survey ( sgps ) @xcite .",
    "the lds was carried out with the 25-m dwingeloo telescope ( fwhm @xmath8 ) on a half - degree grid using frequency - switching mode .",
    "the survey covered the sky north of declination @xmath9 completely on this grid .",
    "its effective velocity coverage spans local standard of rest ( lsr ) velocities from @xmath10 to @xmath11  km s@xmath2 , resolved into spectral channels of 1.03  km s@xmath2 width .",
    "stray radiation correction is applied to lsd data .",
    "the nominal brightness - temperature sensitivity of the lds is 0.07  k. the velocity resolution is not critical for the identification of fvws because fvws are extended over a quite wide velocity range .",
    "we smoothed each spectrum to a resolution of 3.09 km s@xmath2 , so that the rms noise of the final cubes used for the identification becomes @xmath12 k.    the parkes survey is a part of sgps , a survey of the hi  spectral line and 21-cm continuum emission in the fourth quadrant of the galactic plane .",
    "the parkes survey covers @xmath13@xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the parkes data were obtained with the inner seven beams of the parkes multibeam system , a 13 beam 21-cm receiver package at prime focus on the parkes 64 m radio telescope ( fwhm@xmath16 ) , by the process of `` on - the - fly '' mapping .",
    "the final calibrated parkes data consist of 10 cubes with a cell size of @xmath17 , and a velocity resolution of 0.82 km s@xmath2 covering from @xmath18 to @xmath19  km s@xmath2 .",
    "the rms noise of the survey in brightness temperature varies from 0.13 to 0.27  k depending on the cube .",
    "the main survey area ( @xmath20 ) was re - observed to put limits on the amount of stray radiation , so that the rms noise is significantly better in this area ( @xmath21  k ) .",
    "for the coherence of this study , we convolved the parkes data using a gaussian beam to have the same angular resolution as the lds and then re - gridded the data with a grid interval of @xmath22 .",
    "the velocity channels are not smoothed ( but just regridded to a grid of 1.03  km s@xmath2  interval ) because the resulting data cubes have rms noise ( 0.020.04 k ) already lower than that of the lds data cubes .",
    "we have identified fvws by drawing large scale ( @xmath3,@xmath4 ) diagrams of each quadrant every @xmath22 in galactic latitude for galactic latitudes of @xmath7 .",
    "all identification was carried out with bare eyes .",
    "we first selected areas protruding from the galactic background hi  emission at contours between 0.1  k and about 1.0  k. among them , we chose the ones with velocity extent greater than @xmath2320  km s@xmath2 compared to the neighborhood area .",
    "then , we looked into the channel images to make sure that their high - velocity features are clearly visible .",
    "we limited our selection only for those that are confined in small regions ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the @xmath25  criterion is not based on an astrophysical consideration , but is rather empirical .",
    "however , this should be a reasonable choice for identifying missing snrs because most of them might reside in the inner galaxy and smaller than @xmath26  ( kk04 ) . in fig .",
    "[ introfig ] , for example , the features near @xmath27 , @xmath28 and 173are selected .",
    "but , the ones confined in somewhat broad longitude regions ( @xmath29 ) near @xmath30 , 40 , and 100are not selected .",
    "those features do not seem to be real but to be caused by data reduction process .",
    "in lds data , the spectra in a @xmath31 box are reduced at same time and these excess emissions are confined in @xmath31 square areas almost exactly .",
    "fvws could not be identified in the areas where groups of hvcs or intermediate - velocity clouds ( ivcs ) , or supershells make the velocity boundary complicated or where the velocity boundary is unclear or clumpy .",
    "for example , anti - center shell , and hvc complexe h and g highly contaminate the negative velocity boundaries near @xmath32 , and some velocity boundaries at high latitudes in the inner galaxy are clumpy due to many hvcs .",

    "visible hi  snrs are concentrated in the inner galaxy along the loci of tangent points ( @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) because the sn rate is higher in the inner galaxy and because the systemic velocities of snrs in those regions are close to either the maximum or the minimum velocities of the galactic background emission .",

    "these results , showing that the expected distribution of visible hi  snrs is quite different from that of fvws , however , does not necessarily rule out the sn origin for fvws : firstly , the number of hi  snrs in the inner galaxy could be significantly less than that in the model if the interstellar space there is largely filled with a very tenuous gas instead of warm neutral medium ( 0.14 @xmath98 ) as kk04 pointed out . and , secondly , in the outer galaxy , there could be more visible hi  snrs than the model because the identification is relatively easy there .",

    "for example , molecular outflow at a speed of @xmath157  km s@xmath2 has been detected in agb carbon star v hya @xcite .",
    "these molecular winds may collide with the interstellar medium to produce fast - moving atomic gas .",
    "in particular , the fwhm of the latitude distribution of carbon stars is comparable to that of fvws , e.g. , @xmath158 based on the catalog of galactic carbon stars of @xcite .",
    "but the mass loss rate of agb stars is low ( @xmath159 m@xmath129 yr@xmath2 ) , so that the resulting 21-cm emission might be too faint .    in summary ,",
    "while some of fvws could be produced by nearby massive stars with large wind luminosity , the stellar winds or wind - blown shells from low- or high - mass protostars , or agb stars do nt seem to be capable of producing most of fvws .",
    "fvw appears as a faint extended wing - like feature in large - scale ( @xmath3,@xmath4 ) diagram .",
    "since they have excessive emission at high velocities forbidden by the galactic rotation , there should be some dynamical phenomena associated .",
    "thus , fvws are closely related to the dynamical energy sources in the galaxy and their effects on the ism .    in this paper",
    ", we have identified 87 fvws in the galactic plane in use of the lds and the sgps data .",
    "fvws show double - peak distribution in longitude .",
    "they have wide fwhm of about @xmath160 in latitude and slightly skewed to positive latitude .",
    "about 70  % of fvws do have positive lsr velocities .",
    "these statistical properties appear to reflect the identifiability of fvws in the first place , e.g. , how smooth and sharp the boundary of the general galactic hi  emission is in @xmath89 diagram .",
    "but there are properties that appear to be intrinsic too , e.g. , the small number of fvws at @xmath161180@xmath162 .",
    "the column densities of most fvws are less than @xmath163 @xmath80 .",
    "we compared the catalog of fvws with those of snrs , galaxies , and hvcs , and found that @xmath164  % are not coincident with those known objects .",
    "we investigated the possibility that fvws could be the old hi  snrs invisible in radio continuum ( kk04 ) .",
    "the distribution of fvws is different from that of the expected hi  snrs , and the fwhm of fvws is wider than that of snrs .",
    "the possibility of fvws to be the old hi  snrs is not promising in this regard . instead a good fraction of fvws may be related to anomalous velocity clouds or o - type / wr stars : about 30% of fvws unrelated to the known sources have discrete hi  bumps that are a bit seperated from the galactic hi  .",
    "those fvws could be isolated clouds similar to the newly discovered halo clouds @xcite . about 15% of fvws unrelated to the known sources have nearby o - type stars .",
    "thus , these fvws could be due to the stellar winds from those stars .",
    "the origin of the remaining 55% of fvws unrelated to the known sources is uncertain . in a sense that the hi  snrs are , at least , strong and fast enough to be detected as fvws , snrs still remain as a strong candidate of fvws .",
    "if fvws are indeed the oldest type of snr , that which is essentially invisible except via its hi  line emission , then only high resolution hi  observations might be able to reveal their nature .",
