    "we check the absolute magnitudes in all sdss bands given in the nsa and redshifts from the sdss spectra ( and/or ned when available ) , as well as visually inspect the sdss images .",
    "this results in the identification of many interlopers : nearby massive galaxies with erroneous mass estimates ( these tend to have an obviously incorrect magnitude in an sdss band ) , portions of nearby galaxies ( including hii regions and star clusters ) , and faint high - redshift galaxies . interloping massive galaxies hosting agn , in particular ,",

    "we then checked for background flares and removed time intervals in which the background rate was @xmath37 above the mean level . for each observation",
    ", we improved the _",
    "_ astrometry by cross - matching the detected x - ray point sources to the sdss ( which has absolute astrometry accurate to @xmath38 ) , and applied the resulting bore - sight corrections following @xcite , as follows .",
    "first , we create x - ray images , including only the 0.3 - 7.0 kev range , where _",
    "chandra _ is best calibrated .",
    "then , we run a wavelet detection algorithm on each activated chip using ` ciao wavdetect ` with a sensitivity threshold corresponding to one expected spurious source per field ( i.e. , for a 1024@xmath391024 pixel image , this corresponds to a ` wavdetect ` significance threshold of @xmath4010@xmath41 ) .",
    "we cross - match the list of x - ray sources with optical sources in the sdss catalog ( with @xmath42 mag ) , excluding x - ray sources within three half - light radii of the target galaxy .",
    "if at least two sources were found in common , we generated a new aspect solution file for the _ chandra _ observation .",
    "this resulted in improved astrometry for @xmath43 of the observations and the corrections were in the range @xmath44 .",
    "the final astrometric solutions are accurate to between 02 and 05 .    after registering the _ chandra _ images to the sdss , we restrict further analysis to the 2 - 7 kev energy band to search for hard x - ray point sources within three half - light radii of our target galaxies ( as the contribution from background x - ray sources is expected to dominate beyond this ; see @xcite ) .",
    "we run ` wavdetect ` on each hard image with wavelet scales of 1.0 , 1.4 , and 2.0 pixels , using a 4.5 kev exposure map . as before , we adjust the ` wavdetect ` sensitivity threshold for each image so that we expect at most one spurious detection per field .",
    "this yielded a total of 60 hard x - ray sources in 26 galaxies .",
    "for the positional accuracy of each source centroid , we estimate 95% error circles ( @xmath45 ) using the empirical formula derived by ( * ? ? ? * see their equation 5 ) ; this formula depends on number of hard net counts detected by wavdetect , and the location of each source on the acis detector .",
    "the majority of the hard x - ray sources ( 86% ) have modest positional uncertainties @xmath463 .",
    "the remaining sources are typically located toward an edge of the detector , and can have uncertainties up to @xmath4010  in the most extreme cases .",
    "we then perform aperture photometry on the hard x - ray images .",
    "we adopt circular apertures with radii corresponding to the 90% encircled energy fraction at 4.5 kev .",
    "the aperture sizes varied from 30 - 206 , depending on the off - axis position of each galaxy . in most cases , background counts were calculated from an annulus with inner and outer radii of 10   and 30  surrounding the source centroid position ( masking out overlapping point - like x - ray sources when present ) . for sources",
    "farther from the aim - point with larger apertures , we used background annuli with inner and outer radii of 20  and 40 .",
    "the number of counts in each background annulus are then normalized to the area of each circular source aperture , to estimate the number of expected background counts in each aperture .",
    "we use the 4.5 kev exposure map to estimate effective exposure times at the location of each source on the detector .",
    "the net counts were then divided by 0.9 to correct for the finite aperture size .",
    "it is possible for wavdetect to return a small number of spurious detections , so we further examine each x - ray source . any spurious detections would be caused primarily by statistical fluctuations ( i.e. , the optics and detector characteristics of _ chandra _ are well - constrained and accounted for during the reduction procedure ) .",
    "since we excluded time intervals subject to unusually high background levels ( and limit ourselves to hard x - ray images where the background is typically low ; see table  [ tab : xray ] ) , random fluctuations are determined by poisson statistics . using the source and background apertures customized for each x - ray source above , we re - assess which hard x - ray sources are detected at a statistically meaningful level . to retain a source",
    ", we require a number of counts higher than the background level ( within each source aperture ) at the @xmath4795% confidence level . for observations with low sky background ( @xmath460.5 expected counts within the source aperture ) , we set the detection threshold at 3 counts @xcite . for sources with large sky backgrounds ,",
    "we adopt the 95% confidence level from the bayesian formalism of @xcite , where a typical threshold is 34 counts for cases with 0.51 expected background counts within the source aperture .",
    "sources below the detection threshold calculated above are excluded from further analysis .",

    "therefore , our study is generally only sensitive to the luminous tail of the xrb population , and more massive accreting bhs .    interestingly , even after considering the above bias , we find that a substantial fraction of the galaxies in our sample ( 42% ) exhibit statistically meaningful enhanced hard x - ray emission , the majority of which have x - ray sources consistent with the optical nucleus . the dwarf seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4395 @xcite is included in this sub - sample , demonstrating that searching for enhanced ( cumulative ) hard x - ray emission can indeed be a useful diagnostic for identifying agn in dwarf galaxies .",
    "however , enhanced hard x - ray emission is neither a necessary nor sufficient requirement for an accreting massive bh . enhanced galaxy - wide x - ray emission from off - nuclear x - ray sources ( thought to be luminous xrbs ) has been observed in other studies , especially in low - metallicity dwarfs where the enhancement is up to a factor of 10 larger than for @xmath40solar - metallicity galaxies @xcite .",
    "follow - up x - ray observations , as well as observations at other wavelengths can help distinguish between stellar - mass xrbs and more massive bhs in our sample .",
    "high - resolution radio observations offer a promising way forward since the ratio of compact radio to hard x - ray emission is significantly higher for accreting massive bhs compared to stellar mass bhs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the combination of radio and x - ray observations have so far revealed candidate massive bhs in the dwarf galaxies henize 2 - 10 @xcite and mrk 709 @xcite .",
    "eleven galaxies in our sample are detected in either the first or nvss surveys , however the angular resolution is not sufficient to associate radio emission with any particular x - ray source .",
    "mid - ir diagnostics ( e.g. , with _ wise _ ) have been used to select luminous agn with high confidence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however using mid - ir colors to identify agn in dwarf galaxies is not straightforward .",
    "for example , star - forming dwarf galaxies can have mid - ir colors overlapping those of _ wise_-selected agn @xcite .",
    "regardless of the masses of the bhs in our sample , our results have important implications for the impact of x - ray - producing bhs in low - mass galaxies on the epoch of reionization ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
