    "spin - based qubits , owing to their long coherence times and individual coherent manipulation , are promising candidates for building blocks of quantum information processors.@xcite a conventional spin qubit can be simply realized via zeeman splitting of two kramers - degenerate states by a static magnetic field and controlled by an ac magnetic field.@xcite however , its application is limited due to the difficulty in generating and localizing an ac magnetic field at the nanoscale . owing to the interplay between spin and orbital degrees of freedom ,",
    "the spin - orbit qubit allows the possibility for manipulating spins via an easily - accessible ac electric field , i.e. , by means of the electric - dipole spin resonance ( edsr).@xcite intuitively , the interplay between spin and orbit can arise from the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , e.g. , the rashba or dresselhaus type , which couples the electron spin @xmath0 to the momentum @xmath1 .",
    "the soc - mediated edsr has been widely studied in the literature.@xcite instead of invoking soc , an alternative way to achieve the interplay between spin and orbit is coupling the electron spin @xmath0 to the coordinate @xmath2 .",
    "this spin - coordinate coupling can be accomplished by , e.g. , an inhomogeneous zeeman - like interaction @xcite or a fluctuating hyperfine interaction.@xcite    apart from coherent manipulation , scaling up the spin - orbit - qubit architecture also involves quantum information storing and transferring .",
    "embedding the spin - orbit qubit into a cavity resonator to achieve spin - photon coupling seems particularly attractive , as the mobile photons in the cavity can store and transfer quantum information with little loss of coherence.@xcite indeed , in view of their energy scales , the semiconductor - based spin - orbit qubit is compatible with the superconducting microwave resonator .",
    "moreover , integrating the spin - orbit qubit into the superconducting cavity promotes hybrid quantum communications , e.g. , in combination with superconducting qubits or charge qubits.@xcite several proposals for coupling spin - orbit qubits to superconducting cavities have been reported.@xcite however , the spin - orbit qubit invoking soc requires an external static magnetic field,@xcite which is not naturally compatible with superconducting cavities of high quality factors.@xcite therefore , a spin - orbit qubit without an external magnetic field is preferred for constructing a hybrid system .",
    "it has been proposed that , by using an inhomogeneous zeeman - like interaction induced by ferromagnetic contacts or micromagnets,@xcite one can realize spin - orbit qubits in the absence of a magnetic field and effectively couple them to superconducting cavities.@xcite    in this work , we propose a spin - orbit qubit mediated by the spin - coordinate coupling and study its coupling to a superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator .",
    "different from previous studies,@xcite our proposal relies on the inhomogeneous exchange field arising from the multiferroic insulators with a cycloidal spiral magnetic order.@xcite these multiferroic insulators provide a unique opportunity for the design of functional devices owing to the cycloidal spiral magnetic order as well as the magnetoelectric coupling.@xcite in our setup for the spin - orbit qubit , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , a gated nanowire with a quantum dot is placed on top of a multiferroic insulator .",
    "the spiral exchange field arising from the magnetic moments in the multiferroic insulator causes an inhomogeneous zeeman - like interaction on the quantum - dot spin .",
    "therefore , a spin - orbit qubit is produced in the nanowire quantum dot .",
    "the absence of an external magnetic field facilitates the integration of the spin - orbit qubit into the superconducting coplanar waveguide , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) . in this hybrid circuit , both the level spacing of the spin - orbit qubit and the spin - photon coupling depend on the ratio between the dot size and the wavelength of the spiral magnetic order in the substrate .",
    "when the rashba soc is introduced into the nanowire , the level spacing and spin - photon coupling can be adjusted by tuning the rashba soc via a gate voltage on the nanowire . with the modulation of the rashba soc",
    ", we can obtain an effective spin - photon coupling with an efficient on / off switching .",
    "this is promising for manipulating , storing and transferring quantum information in the data bus provided by the circuit cavity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we establish the spin - orbit qubit on the surface of a multiferroic insulator .",
    "after that , we integrate the spin - orbit qubit into a superconducting coplanar waveguide and study its spin - photon coupling .",
    "we further study the modulation of the rashba soc on the hybrid system .",
    "at last we discuss the experimental realizability of the proposed device .",
    "our study starts from the device schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) . in this setup ,",
    "a nanowire lies on the surface of a multiferroic insulator , e.g. , tbmno@xmath3 or bifeo@xmath3,@xcite and is aligned parallel to the propagation direction of the spiral magnetic moments in the substrate .",
    "the nanowire is gated by two electrodes producing a quantum dot , which is assumed to be subject to a 1d parabolic potential .",

    "two gate electrodes on the top and bottom of the multiferroic insulator supply a voltage @xmath4 which controls the spiral helicity of the magnetic order .",
    "( b )  schematic of the integration of the spin - orbit qubit into a superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator .",
    "the nanowire is placed parallel to the electric field between the center conductor and the ground plane and located at the maximum of the electric field .",
    "note that in the multiferroic - insulator substrate , only the magnetic moments near the nanowire are schematically shown by the rotating arrows.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    we consider a single electron in the quantum dot . in the coordinate system with the @xmath5-axis along the nanowire and the @xmath6-axis perpendicular to the top surface of the multiferroic insulator",
    ", the electron is described by the hamiltonian , @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the effective electron mass and @xmath9 is the momentum operator . the second term in the hamiltonian is the parabolic potential .",
    "the last term depicts the interaction between the electron spin @xmath0 and the exchange field from the cycloidal spiral magnetic moments , @xmath10 in writing this term we have assumed the dot size @xmath11 to be much larger than the distance ( @xmath12  0.1  nm ) between the nearby magnetic atoms in the substrate . here",
    "@xmath13 is the wavevector of the spiral order corresponding to a wavelength @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is the phase of the exchange field at @xmath17 .",
    "the spiral helicity @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) of the magnetic order is reversable by a gate voltage on the multiferroic insulator [ as illustrated by @xmath4 in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ] due to the magnetoelectric coupling.@xcite the strength of the exchange coupling @xmath20 ( we assume @xmath21 ) between the electron spin and the magnetic moments , depending on their distance and the specific hosts , is weak and assumed to be of the order of 1 - 10  @xmath22ev.@xcite    due to the spiral geometry of the magnetic order , the macroscopic magnetism of the multiferroic insulator is zero , while the exchange coupling still breaks the time - reversal symmetry locally and causes an inhomogeneous zeeman - like interaction on the quantum - dot spin . in the presence to this inhomogeneous zeeman - like interaction , a spin - orbit qubit is realizable in the quantum dot .",
    "one can also understand the availability of a spin - orbit qubit in our setup in the spiral frame with the spin @xmath23-axis along the local magnetic moment . using a unitary transformation @xmath24 , where @xmath25}$],@xcite one arrives at @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "this hamiltonian evidently indicates that in the spiral frame , the exchange field supplies not only the homogeneous zeeman - like interaction , @xmath28 , but also an effective rashba - like soc , @xmath29.@xcite this hamiltonian is equivalent to the one studied in ref .  , where a spin - orbit qubit was realized by virtue of an external magnetic field and the genuine rashba / dresselhaus soc .",
    "now we demonstrate the realization of a spin - orbit qubit by studying the low - energy bound states in the quantum dot . for the reasonable case with @xmath30 ,",
    "the exchange coupling can be treated as a perturbation .",
    "we rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 .",

    "we focus on the @xmath41 hilbert subspace which is two - fold degenerate .",

    "with the aid of the spiral exchange field supplied by a multiferroic insulator , we realize a spin - orbit qubit in the absence of an external magnetic field as well as the rashba / dresselhaus soc .",
    "the spin - orbit qubit can respond to an ac electric field , via edsr.@xcite due to the small level spacing , the spin - orbit qubit is controllable by low - temperature microwave technology .",
    "this can be accomplished by virtue of a superconducting resonator , which works at temperatures @xmath12  mk with resonance frequencies @xmath12  ghz.@xcite indeed , integrating spin - orbit qubits into superconducting resonators has recently attracted much interest,@xcite to explore novel hybrid quantum circuits.@xcite moreover , the spin - orbit qubit proposed here , which is external - magnetic - field - free , is naturally compatible with superconducting resonators of high quality factors .    as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , we embed the spin - orbit qubit into a superconducting coplanar waveguide,@xcite with the nanowire aligned parallel to the electric field between the center conductor and the ground plane .",
    "the resonant photon energy ( @xmath12  ghz ) is too low to excite magnons in the multiferroic - insulator substrate,@xcite and we assume that the spiral magnetic order keeps steady during the operation of the spin - orbit qubit .",

    "note that in this device , both the level spacing @xmath62 and the spin - photon coupling @xmath63 are independent of the phase @xmath15 and proportional to the exchange coupling strength @xmath20 .",
    "also , both @xmath62 and @xmath63 strongly depend on the ratio between the dot size @xmath64 and the wavelength @xmath14 of the spiral magnetic order . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we plot the dependence of @xmath65 and @xmath66 on the parameter @xmath67 .",
    "one finds that when @xmath67 is close to 1 , both @xmath62 and @xmath68 approach zero , hindering the device operation . this is",
    "because when @xmath67 is large , the exchange field , oscillating with a high frequency in the scale of the dot size , has quite small matrix elements between the @xmath69 and @xmath70 states .",
    "this leads to a vanishing zeeman - like splitting and spin - orbit mixing of the harmonic oscillator states .",
    "however , in the @xmath71 limit , @xmath62 reaches its maximum while @xmath68 again approaches zero .",
    "in fact , in this regime , with the approximately homogeneous exchange field experienced by the quantum - dot electron , the spin - orbit interplay becomes quite weak and a nearly pure spin qubit with the largest zeeman - like splitting is obtained .     of the spin - orbit qubit and dimensionless spin - photon coupling @xmath66 versus the dimensionless dot size @xmath67.,title=\"fig:\",width=340 ]",
    "although the spin - orbit qubit proposed here is available without employing the rashba / dresselhaus soc , in reality the soc may be present and even important . nonetheless , the rashba soc is controllable , e.g. , by a gate voltage applied to the nanowire [ as illustrated by @xmath72 from the gate electrode on top of the nanowire in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ] . below",
    "we introduce the rashba soc into the nanowire , supplying an effective channel to modulate the spin - orbit qubit as well as its coupling to photons .    with the rashba soc included , the hamiltonian given by eq .",

    "the hamiltonian @xmath80 has exactly the same form as in eq .",
    "( [ hamil ] ) .",
    "therefore , one can obtain the low - energy eigenstates of @xmath81 immediately based on the results given previously . by noting that the electric dipole moment commutes with the unitary operator @xmath82 , one straightforwardly obtains the level spacing of the spin - orbit qubit and the spin - photon coupling in the presence of the rashba soc , @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",
    "the above results can be understood by considering the rashba soc to superimpose on the effective rashba - like soc from the spiral geometry , or , in other words , to equivalently modulate the wavelength of the spiral magnetic order .",
    "this feature allows to control both the level spacing of the spin - orbit qubit and the spin - photon coupling by adjusting the rashba soc via the gate voltage . to show the modulation of the rashba soc on the hybrid system , in figs .",
