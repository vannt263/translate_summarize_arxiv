    "<S> the role of van hove singularity in one of the bands on the properties of intra - band clean superconductor has been discussed . </S>",
    "<S> it leads to marked increase of superconducting transition temperature in the weak coupling limit . </S>",
    "<S> we study the inhomogeneous systems in which the characteristics change from place to place by solving the bogolubov - de gennes equations for small clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the suppression of the superconducting order parameter by the single impurity scattering the fermions between bands is contrasted with that due to intra - band impurity scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained for impure systems have been shown as a maps of local density of states , the order parameter and gap function . </S>",
    "<S> they can be directly compared with stm spectra of the real material . </S>"
