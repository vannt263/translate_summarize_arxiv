    "numerical cosmological models built within the @xmath5-cold dark matter ( @xmath5-cdm ) paradigm ( bullock & johnson 2005 ; cooper et al . 2010 ; pillepich , madau & mayer 2014 ) predict that deep imaging of the stellar halos of nearby large spiral galaxies should display a wide variety of diffuse , low - surface brightness stellar sub - structures .",
    "the most common features are stellar streams or shells , which result from interactions between the parent galaxy and its dwarf satellite companions .",
    "the detection of such features as a _ ubiquitous _ feature of all galaxies , as is implied by @xmath5-cdm , remains untested observationally .",
    "this is largely due the challenge of producing images with sufficient surface brightness sensitivity and low background fluctuations to reliably detect such faint features .",
    "although more luminous examples of diffuse stellar streams and shells around massive elliptical galaxies have been known for many decades ( e.g. , arp 1966 ; schweizer & seitzer 1988 ; duc et al .",
    "2014 ) , recent studies have detected much fainter analogues of these structures around spiral galaxies in the local universe , including the milky way ( mw ) and andromeda .",
    "moreover , recent extensive photometric databases have for the first time provided spectacular panoramic views of the mw tidal streams ( majewski et al .",
    "2003 ; belokurov et al . 2006 ; slater et al . 2014 ) and revealed the existence of large stellar sub - structures within the mw halo , which have been interpreted as observational evidence to understand our galaxy s past and present hierarchical formation .",
    "likewise , the pan - andromeda archaeological survey ( pandas ; mcconnachie et al .",
    "2009 ) has provided a panoramic view of the andromeda halo , which reveals a striking diversity of halo sub - structures akin to those observed in the mw .",
    "these observations provide sound empirical support for the @xmath5-cdm prediction that tidally disrupted dwarf galaxies are important contributors to stellar halo formation , at least for the local group spirals .    while stellar streams in the mw and andromeda can be studied in detail from studies using resolved stellar populations , direct comparison of these features to cosmological models",
    "is complicated by ` cosmic variance '  the fact that each large spiral has experienced a unique hierarchical formation history that depends on the number and timing of satellite accretions , as well as both the internal kinematics and orbital properties of the individual satellites . a search for analogues to those features observed in the mw and andromeda across a larger sample of nearby spiral galaxies is required to understand if the recent merger histories for local group spirals are typical , an issue that remains unclear ( mutch et al .",
    "current @xmath5-cdm numerical simulations can guide this quest for star - stream observational signatures ( e.g. , johnston et al .",
    "2008 ; cooper et al .",
    "these simulations have demonstrated that the characteristics of sub - structure currently visible in stellar halos are sensitive to recent ( 0 - 8 gyr ago ) merger histories of galaxies , which is a timescale that corresponds to the last few tens of percent of mass accretion for a spiral galaxy like the mw .",
    "these models predict that a survey of @xmath4100 parent galaxies reaching a surface brightness of @xmath429 mag arcsec@xmath6 would reveal many tens of tidal features , perhaps nearly one detectable stream per galaxy ( at this surface brightness limit ) .",
    "a direct comparison of these simulations with actual observations is not possible because no suitable dataset yet exists .",
    "thus , the observational portrait of satellite accretion events is far from complete .",
    "recent deep , wide - field images of nearby mw analogue galaxies within the local volume taken with small telescopes has revealed an assortment of large - scale tidal structures in the halos of several nearby galaxies . for the first time , the detected features exhibit the striking morphological diversity predicted by cosmological models ( martnez - delgado et al .",
    "2010 ; md2010 , hereafter ) .",
    "in addition , a systematic automated search around @xmath4450 spiral galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey has provided the first estimate of the frequency of tidal features around spiral galaxies to a limiting surface brightness of 27 - 28 mag arcsec@xmath6 ( @xmath4 10 - 15% ; miskolczi et al .",
    "both observational projects have also yielded an unprecedented sample of bright stellar streams in nearby spiral galaxies , including the discovery of observational analogues to the canonical morphologies predicted from @xmath3-body models of stellar halos that are entirely constructed from satellite accretion ( johnston et al .",
    "in addition , there are other ongoing projects to map the surroundings of nearby massive galaxies to detect tidal streams and new satellites ( e.g. ludwig et al . 2012 ; duc et al . 2014 ; van dokkum & abrahan 2014).the detection of these structures offers a unique opportunity to study the still dramatic last stages of galaxy assembly in the local universe ( e.g. foster et al . 2014 ) and to compare the frequency of tidal stellar features against those predicted for mw - sized galaxies in the @xmath5-cdm paradigm .    encouraged from these results , the _ stellar tidal stream survey _ ( pi .  martnez - delgado ) is carrying out the first systematic survey of stellar tidal streams to a surface brightness sensitivity of @xmath7=28.5 mag arcsec@xmath6 using a network of small , robotic telescopes placed on different continents .",
    "in this paper , we report the discovery of a giant stellar stream in one of the classical and extensively studied galaxies , ngc4631 , also known as the `` whale galaxy . ''",
    "imaging observations and data reduction are described in section [ sec : obs ] .",
    "the stream is described and placed in the context of other sub - structure in ngc4631 in section [ sec : stream ] .",
    "the stream properties are measured in section [ sec : props ] and used to construct a suitable @xmath3-body model in section [ sec : model ] .",

    "deep imaging of the field around ngc4631 was collected at the remote observatory southern alps ( rosa , verclause , france ) with a 40-cm aperture @xmath8 corrected newtonian telescope .",
    "a fli ml16803 ccd camera was used and provided a pixel scale of 1.237@xmath9 px@xmath10 over a 81@xmath11 field of view .",
    "a set of individual 300 s images were obtained remotely with an astrodon gen2 tru - balance e - series luminance filter ( @xmath12 , hereafter ) over several photometric nights between december 2011 and february 2012 . as shown in fig .   1@xmath13",
    ", this @xmath12 filter is a wide - band , nearly top - hat filter that transmits from @xmath14 , and broadly cover the @xmath15 and @xmath16 bands .",
    "each individual exposure was reduced following standard image processing procedures for dark subtraction , bias correction , and flat fielding adopted for the larger stream survey ( md2010 ) .",
    "the images were combined to create a final co - added image with a total exposure time of 23,100 s.    with the aim of measuring the color of the detected structures ( see sec .  4 ) , we also construct @xmath15 and @xmath16 image mosaics from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 7 ( dr7 ; abazajian et al .",
    "2009 ) following the procedure described in zibetti et al .",
    "because these features are too faint to be detected visually in the sdss mosaic at its native pixel scale , these mosaics were resampled to the same pixel scale as our @xmath12 data ( 1.237@xmath9 px@xmath10 ) .",
    "the @xmath12 data were calibrated to sdss dr7 @xmath16-band magnitudes as described by the following procedure .",
    "first , we remove any residual large - scale sky gradients from our wide - field images by modeling the background with a two - dimensional , fourth - order legendre polynomial .",
    "the polynomial was fit to the median flux within coarse spatial bins that were 5@xmath17 on a side    after all @xmath18 sources were masked .",
    "aperture photometry was then performed on 27 isolated stars that were spatially distributed across the @xmath12 image , which were matched to the sdss dr7 point source catalog ( abazajian et al .",
    "1@xmath19 compares the sdss - measured @xmath16 magnitudes ( @xmath20 ) to the @xmath12 instrumental magnitudes ( @xmath21 ) , revealing a dependence on @xmath22 color spanning @xmath23 mag over the full color range ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the color residuals are expected due to the very different shapes of the @xmath12 and @xmath16-band filter transmission functions .",
    "our flux calibration takes on the following form : @xmath25 where the three coefficients @xmath26 are determined from an iterative fit to the matched photometry for the 27 calibration stars .",
    "the final fit to the 27 sdss calibration stars is given in fig .",
    "1@xmath19 . in fig .  1@xmath27 , we show the residuals from our derived flux calibration relation for the 27 stars , which have no remaining dependence on the @xmath22 color .",
    "the residuals have a standard deviation of 0.03 mag , which is adopted as the uncertainty in the flux calibration and is added in quadrature to the measurement errors reported hereafter .",
    "we use the method described in md2010 for determining the limiting depth of our image , due to both photon noise and larger - scale background variations due to flat fielding , ghosts , and scattered light . to measure the photon noise limit",
    ", we calculate the mean of the standard deviation measured from 25 small @xmath28 pixel boxes that were randomly distributed throughout the image , away from stellar and extended sources . to measure large - scale background fluctuations , we calculated five times the standard deviation of 25 randomly placed boxes in the background having a typical size comparable to the spatial extent of the faint features we intend to measure ( here , @xmath29 in size ) . using @xmath30 , which is the midpoint of the range of @xmath22 colors of the features measured below , we find that the @xmath31 @xmath16-band limiting surface brightness of our @xmath12 data for photon noise is @xmath32 mag arcsec@xmath6 while the @xmath31 limit due to large - scale variations is @xmath33 mag arcsec@xmath6 . in our measurements ,",
    "we correct for foreground galactic extinction by adopting the value appropriate at the coordinates of ngc4631 for the entire rosa field of view ( @xmath34 ; schlafly & finkbeiner 2011 ) .",
    "our deep @xmath12 , wide field , panoramic view of the moderately interacting pair ngc4631/4656 ( with a projected separation of @xmath35 = 69 kpc ) is given in fig .",
    "2 . our deep image reveals two low surface brightness , extended structures on either side of ngc4631 .",
    "we will refer to the ` bridge - like ' feature to the south - east of ngc4631 as stream@xmath0 , and that to the north - west as stream@xmath1 .",
    "the two features are roughly aligned with each other at a position angle ( pa ) of @xmath36 , which suggests a common origin .",
    "if so , the discontinuity of the structure on the nw side of the galaxy could be due to the limiting surface brightness of the rosa image .",
    "interestingly , stream@xmath1 shows a more luminous inner region within the more elongated lower surface brightness feature .",
    "this structure is similar to that of a tidal disrupting dwarf galaxy ( see for example ngc4216 in md2010 ; fig .  1 or paudel et al .",
    "2013 ) and suggests that it maybe the progenitor of stream@xmath0",
    ". we also note faint debris present between ngc4656 and its companion , ngc4656uv ( schechtman - rook & hess 2012 ) , indicative of interactions between these two galaxies .",
    "the detection of further , fainter structures is hampered by contamination from faint galactic cirrus , which is barely visible in fig .",
    "2 .        fig .",
    "3 shows a zoomed region with an appropriate size to fit the ngc4631 stellar halo . for illustrative purpose",
    ", we have included a color inset of the disk of the galaxy taken with the black bird observatory during the pilot survey of this project(md 2010 ) .",
    "this better resolves the vertical structures of the disk and the morphological disturbances of ngc4627 , a dwarf elliptical ( de ) satellite of ngc4631 clearly interacting with its parent galaxy .",
    "although the extrapolation of the path of the stream@xmath0 across the disk passes near the position of ngc4631 in projection , the visible tidal arms of this companion are oriented almost perpendicular to the pa of the streams ( see fig.3 ) . since streams trace the prints of their progenitor system , this suggests that ngc4627 is an unlikely candidate for the progenitor of stream@xmath0 and stream@xmath1 .",
    "it is more likely that ngc4627 is responsible for the optically detected extended vertical structure within the ngc4631 disk ( ann et al .",
    "2011 ) or , given its overall blue mean color ( sec .  4 ) , to the complex gas streams described below .",
    "zoom into the rosa @xmath12 image ( fig .  1 ) to feature just the ngc4631 stellar halo with isophotal boundaries overlaid for the major sub - substructures .",
    "the image is approximately 42.5 @xmath37 @xmath38 34.6 @xmath37 in a sky right orientation .",
    "the two green isophotes around ngc4631 correspond to @xmath39 mag arcsec@xmath6 and @xmath40 mag arcsec@xmath6 .",
    "the small , green isophote around dw2 corresponds to @xmath41 mag arcsec@xmath6 , which is the faintest closed isophote that excludes emission from the ngc4631 stellar halo .",
    "the green isophote for dw1 , the red isophote for stream@xmath1 and the blue isophote for the stream@xmath0 all correspond to @xmath42 mag / arcsec@xmath6 .",
    ", width=321 ]    an alternative explanation for the observed faint tidal features is that they could be due to the tidal tails from the interaction of ngc4631 with its large - spiral companion , ngc4656 , a formation scenario that is also proposed to explain a similar extended plume in ngc 3628 ( rots 1978 ) .",
    "however , as is discussed in sec .  5 , the edge - on perspective and visual configuration of both interacting systems and the morphology of the stream likely rules out this scenario .    assuming that the two stream - like pieces have a common origin and are at the same distance of ngc4631 ( @xmath43 ; radburn - smith et al .",
    "2011 ) , the total projected length of that structure is at least 85.2 kpc , as measured from the far edges of the ellipses fit to the isophotes of stream@xmath0 and the stream@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "we also measured the widths of stream@xmath0 and the possible progenitor ( within stream@xmath1 ) by fitting ellipses to their isophotal boundaries ( see sec .",
    "these ellipses are used only to determine the position angle of the isophote s major axis , which we find to be the same within the uncertainties for each of the two faint features .",
    "we then collapse a strip of the image using a median combine ( excluding pixels that are masked due to foreground stellar sources ) along the direction of the major axis .",
    "the measurement strip is centered on the minor axis of the isophote for each object , and is @xmath44 in width . to measure the widths , we fit a gaussian to each light profile , obtaining a fwhm of @xmath45 kpc and @xmath46 kpc for stream@xmath0 and the progenitor candidate ( within stream@xmath1 ) , respectively .",
    "stream@xmath0 is thus wider than stream@xmath1 by a factor of @xmath47 .",
    "our deep image also detects the presence of two overdensities , marked as dw1 and dw2 in fig .",
    "dw1 , dw2 , and the most luminous , inner portion of stream@xmath1 were reported as dwarf companions of ngc4631 by karatchensev et al .",
    "the first smaller object , dw1 , is well separated from ngc4631 ( @xmath4 10@xmath37 south - east ; 25 kpc ) and it is clearly a faint dwarf spheroidal satellite of ngc4631 .",
    "the second dw2 feature is located 5@xmath37 ( @xmath4 12 kpc ) north of the ngc4631 core and its morphology is consistent with that of a faint , more extended dwarf galaxy satellite . given the surface brightness limit of the @xmath12 image , however , we can not rule out a connection to the vertical structure of the ngc4631 .",
    "in addition to the stellar streams and dwarf galaxy candidates already discussed , the ngc4631 stellar halo contains a complex hi gas morphology .",
    "in fact , it contains two relatively unique features : ( i ) five individual hi tidal features extending from the disk ( rand 1994 , rand & van der hulst 1993 ) ; ( ii ) two hi supershells associated with massive star forming regions that are expelling large masses of gas at high velocities ( rand & van der hulst 1993 ) .",
    "moreover , there is extensive diffuse h@xmath48 emission throughout the gas halo ( donahue et al .",
    "1995 ) , spatially coincident with the gaseous streams .",
    "we compare these data to investigate any potential associations between the stellar and gaseous substructures .    in fig .",
    "4 , we overlay the low - resolution hi zeroth order map of rand ( 1994 ) on the rosa @xmath12 image .",
    "the hi maps were obtained with the very large array ( vla ) at a resolution of 45@xmath49 89@xmath50 over a velocity range of 110 to 1023 km s@xmath10 with velocity resolution of 10 km s@xmath10 .",
    "the single - channel point source sensitivity is m@xmath51 = 7 @xmath38 10@xmath52 for a source at the beam center .",
    "we refer the reader to rand ( 1994 ) for additional details on the observations and data processing .",
    "the five tidal spurs as identified in the rand ( 1994 ) datasets are labelled .",
    "together , the spurs contain 3 @xmath38 10 @xmath53 m@xmath54 of hi gas , approximately one third of that measured for ngc4631 and half of that measured for ngc4656 ( rand 1994 ) .",
    "note that the stellar stream identified in fig .",

    "the hi total intensities are taken from the vla observations presented in rand ( 1994 ) for the velocity range of 110 to 1023 km s@xmath10 and is sensitive to a point source limit of 7 @xmath38 10@xmath55 m@xmath54 .",
    "the five hi tidal features ( spurs ) are labeled ( 1 - 5 ) and the two hi super - shells are indicated with arrows .",
    "stream@xmath0 is juxtaposed between spurs 1 and 2 and is near a region of enhanced h-@xmath48 emission ( donahue et al .",
    "this orientation makes it unlikely that the hi features originated from the same satellite accretion event that created stream@xmath0 .",
    "no hi is associated with stream@xmath1 .",
    "dw2 is embedded within spur 4.,width=321 ]    tidal spurs 1 and 4 are thought to have been formed by interactions between ngc4631 and its large galaxy companion , ngc4656 ( combes 1978 ) .",
    "however , it is unlikely to form stellar streams if the victim galaxy is the higher mass object in interaction ( ngc 4656 according to the observational data ) . spurs 2 and 3 , on the other hand , were interpreted to be formed by tidal interactions between ngc4631 and ngc4627 , its tidally distorted , blue de companion .",
    "modelling of the tidal features , however , is complicated by the lack of reliable kinematic velocities for the dwarf companions in the field .",
    "the projection of each of these features is interesting for many reasons .",
    "first , the stellar stream discovered in this paper is located in between the shells 1 and 2 .",
    "second , the stream intersects the disk at one of the massive star forming regions .",
    "however , the stream itself is not of the morphology or optical colors anticipated by the interaction of a gas rich galaxy at the level needed to explain the gas streams ( 3@xmath3810@xmath53 m@xmath54 ; rand 1994 ) .",
    "moreover , the age of the stellar populations believed to drive hi supershells are far too young to have been affected by a satellite disk passage ( e.g. , akin to the situation observed in ngc5387 ; beaton et al .",
    "2014 ) . assuming a projected radius for the stream of @xmath4 40 - 50 kpc",
    ", it would be unlikely that the progenitor would pass in a gas - rich portion of the ngc4631 disk .",
    "thus , we suspect that neither the gas streams nor the star forming regions are associated with the stellar tidal stream .",
    "our analysis primarily focuses on the two most extended substructures in the ngc4631 stellar halo ",
    "stream@xmath1 ( that possibly includes the progenitor of the stream ) and stream@xmath0 as identified in fig .",
    "3 . using the @xmath12 filter image , we construct isophotes for each of the features corresponding to the @xmath31 large - scale background variation within the @xmath12 data .",
    "these isophotes are then overlaid on the sdss mosaics for each feature and used as boundaries inside of which the total integrated @xmath22 color can be measured to a signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath56 ) that is sufficient for correcting the color term required in equation 1 . in fig .  3 ,",
    "these photometric boundaries are displayed for the features of interest , which correspond to the @xmath57 mag arcsec@xmath6 @xmath16-band surface brightness limit .",
    "due to @xmath56 limitations of our data , there may be faint emission associated with these features that lies outside of these boundaries .",
    "therefore , the luminosities we report are lower limits .",
    "we proceed to measure the integrated @xmath22 color of stream@xmath1 and the stream@xmath0 from the sdss mosaics , which have had all foreground sources masked .",
    "each @xmath15 and @xmath16 mosaic is corrected for foreground galactic extinction by adopting @xmath58 and @xmath34 at the position of ngc4631 for the entire field of view ( schlafly & finkbeiner 2011 ) .",
    "the stream@xmath1 feature has @xmath59 , which is relatively blue .",
    "the stream@xmath0 is significantly redder at @xmath60 .",

    "3 ) . for dw1",
    ", we measure @xmath61 .",

    "the aim of this section is to explore whether the observed stream - like feature around ngc4631 can be directly linked to interactions between this spiral galaxy and one of its dwarf companions by means of a theoretical model .",
    "we also note , as previously demonstrated by toomre & toomre ( 1972 ) and donghia et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , that tidal tails and bridges connecting galaxy pairs continue both to lengthen and to thin out after the encounter .",
    "it was shown in these studies that the efficiency of tail formation depends on the inclinations of the disks relative to the orbital plane . ngc4656 and ngc4631 are both almost edge - on ( e.g. see fig.1 ) and , in particular , ngc4656 is inclined almost 90 degrees relative to the orbital plane of ngc4631 .",
    "this configuration inhibits the formation of any tail or stellar stream and excludes that any effective tidal interaction between ngc4656 and ngc4631 is responsible of the observed extended structure .    in our numerical experiment , we only chose to focus on the extended stellar stream around ngc4631 .",
    "thus , the goal is not to reproduce every detail of this complex system  the interactions of the numerous companions , the hi streams , and the stellar streams  but rather to produce a viable model for the feature discovered here .",
    "a model incorporating all of the observed debris features in the ngc4631 halo and its interaction with ngc4565 would require a parameter search of all the possible orbital configurations and mass ratios for each of the galaxies , which is beyond the scope of the work presented here .",

    "we adopt @xmath99=10@xmath100;10@xmath101 and n@xmath79=10@xmath102;10@xmath55 to model ngc4631 and its orbiting dwarf , respectively .",
    "generally , higher orbital eccentricities for the satellite result in ` fly - by ' encounters , while lower values cause the dwarf s orbit to decay rapidly . given the morphology of the debris , the dwarf galaxy",
    "is placed on an eccentric orbit about ngc4631 ( e = 0.6 ) . with this given orbit",
    "the pericentric distance of the dwarf from the center of ngc4631 is around @xmath10315 kpc and the apocentric distance is @xmath10460 kpc .",
    "the satellite is placed in an orbit around ngc4631 and is evolved over a period of @xmath43.5 gyr .",
    "the simulations were carried out with gadget3 , a parallel treepm - smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code developed to compute the evolution of stars and dark matter , both of which are treated as collisionless uids .",
    "4 displays the resulting @xmath3-body model showing the density of star particles at t@xmath4 3.5 gyr . during the simulations ,",
    "stars are pulled out of the dwarf satellite in its orbit around ngc4631 to form a long stream that is in qualitative agreement with that observed stream displayed in fig .  2 and fig .  3 .",
    "in the model , what remains of the dwarf is contained within the simulated analog of the stream@xmath1 feature . assuming that our derived stream stellar mass lower limit ( @xmath91 m@xmath54",
    "; see sec .",
    "4 ) is @xmath420% of the total mass of the progenitor , as shown by simulations of merging galaxies ( cox et al .",
    "2006 ) , our simulations suggests a total initial stellar mass of @xmath105 m@xmath54 for the dwarf and a total dynamical mass ( including dark matter ) of @xmath106 m@xmath54",
    ". thus the mass ratio of the interaction between ngc4631 and the dwarf satellite causing the observed stellar stream is approximately 40 .",
    "we report the discovery of an extended stellar tidal stream around ngc4631 . from our data , combined with arguments based on simulations of tidal interactions , we conclude that this newly detected stellar stream can not be due to interactions between ngc4631 and the galaxy ngc4656 .",
    "intriguingly , the discovered stellar stream lies between previously detected hi streams ( referred to as spurs 1 and 2 ) , which indicates that the stellar stream is most likely not related to these features and thereby produced by a different progenitor satellite .",
    "this stellar substructure is added to an already rich census of substructure in the ngc4631 halo , including five hi ` spurs ' with overall structure very similar to that of the magellanic stream in the mw halo and in two hi supershells associated with massive star forming regions in its disk .",
    "thus , the ngc4631 stellar halo contains numerous on - going accretion events , akin to the complexity observed in the stellar halos of the local group spirals .",
    "the feature observed around ngc4631 is reproduced by numerical simulations of the tidal interaction of a candidate dwarf galaxy ( embedded in stream@xmath1 ) with its parent , ngc4631 .",
    "the model qualitatively agrees with our assessment from the optical morphology of the features .",
    "we recovered two previously detected faint dwarf galaxy candidates associated with the ngc4631 system that could be the progenitors of the gas streams .",
    "for example , the dw1 might be associated to spur 1 and a possible candidate dw2 could be associated with spur 4 .",
    "however , the investigation of the full complement of dwarf satellite interactions and debris features within the ngc4631 halo is beyond the scope of this paper and it will be explored in a forthcoming study .    a visual inspection of the projected positions of dwarf candidates around ngc 4631 and",
    "the path of the stellar stream might suggest that the substructures might be alligned within an extended plane .",
    "similar configurations have been claimed to be found among satellite galaxies around m31 ( koch & grebel 2006 ; ibata et al 2014 ) and our milky way ( palowski et al .",
    "it has been suggested that this confinement of satellite galaxies in thin planes around galaxies presents a challenge to the theory of hierarchical galaxy clustering .",
    "( palowski et al . 2014 ; donghia & lake 2008 ) . in this context , ngc4631 and",
    "its complex system of satellite galaxies represent an additional interesting case to study the problem of how these satellites fell into a more massive system .",
    "however , follow - up observations to derive accurate distances ( by means of its resolved stellar population ) and radial velocities are needed to shed light on the actual spatial configuration of these structures and their possible common origin .",
