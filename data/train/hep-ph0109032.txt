    "( left ) , displays the experimentally observed excess versus the @xmath0-separation power , the latter being a purely theoretical quantity determined from the @xmath0- and ndis event generators .",
    "it is quite remarkable that experiment and theory seem to be correlated , i.e. that the excess tends to increase with increasing @xmath0-separation power .",
    "the observed excess along with our original , parameter - free theoretical predictions@xcite in the six considered distributions@xcite of @xmath0-sensitive observables is displayed in ( right ) .",
    "the first row shows the three discriminating observables , @xmath66 while the second row displays three further observables without additional cuts applied , @xmath67 in the first four of the six observables in , the excess is intriguingly similar in shape and normalization to our theoretical predictions from qcdins , although its size is partly at a level still comparable to the differences among the considered dis event generators . while the size of the observed excess in the remaining two observables , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , is in rough agreement as well ,",
    "the peaks of these two experimental distributions appear to be shifted towards smaller values compared to qcdins , and the widths are also considerably narrower .    here , some important theoretical comments are in place@xcite .",
    "one has to take into account that so far the preliminary h1 data incorporate only part of the theoretically required cuts : while the @xmath70 gev@xmath71 cut ( [ fiducial ] ) has been applied to the data , both the @xmath72-cut ( [ fiducial ] ) and notably a further cut on @xmath73 , @xmath74 ( c.f .",
    "refs.@xcite ) , are lacking . in refs.@xcite , as well as in ( right ) (",
    "solid line ) , these data are compared to the qcdins output with _ active _ @xmath72-cut ( [ fiducial ] ) , but with the default @xmath73-cut ( [ q2cut ] ) switched off to match the data .",
    "the implications of the lacking @xmath75-cut in the data are presumably not too serious , since qcdins _ with _ the default @xmath72-cut models to some extent the sharp suppression of @xmath0-effects , apparent in the lattice data ( c.f .",
    "( right ) ) for @xmath76 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath77 .",
    "yet , this lacking , experimental cut introduces a substantial uncertainty in the predicted magnitude of the @xmath0-signal that hopefully may be eliminated soon . the dash - dotted line in ( right )",
    "illustrates that the overall size of the @xmath0-signal strongly depends on the actual value of the @xmath72-cut used in qcdins .",
    "the slightly reduced value of @xmath78 in ( right ) is certainly compatible with ( right ) , but improves the agreement with the observed excess considerably , as compared to the default @xmath79 .",
    "next , consider the effects of the lacking @xmath73-cut ( [ q2cut ] ) . as a brief reminder@xcite ,",
    "this cut assures in particular the dominance of `` planar '' handbag - type graphs in @xmath80 and all final - state observables .",
    "the non - planar contributions do not share the simple , probabilistic interpretation of the planar ones , involve instantons with a size determined by @xmath81 rather than @xmath82 and are both hard to calculate and hard to implement in a monte carlo generator . on account of their known power suppression in @xmath83 and a cross - check in the simplest case without final - state gluons@xcite ,",
    "they can be safely neglected upon application of the cut ( [ q2cut ] ) .",
    "because of these reasons , the non - planar contributions are _ not _ implemented in the qcdins event generator , corresponding to unreliable qcdins results for small @xmath73 .    from a detailed study of the effects of the lacking @xmath73-cut ( [ q2cut ] ) in ref.@xcite",
    ", the following conclusions have emerged .    *",
    "the shape of the @xmath69 and @xmath84 distributions for @xmath0-events are strongly affected by the missing @xmath73-cut ( see e.g. @xmath69 in ( left ) ) , unlike the four remaining observables ( see e.g. @xmath85 in ( right ) ) .",
    "* by cutting out the phase space region where qcdins is unreliable ( @xmath86 gev@xmath71 ) , both the resulting @xmath69 and @xmath84-peaks are left - shifted and become narrower , in good agreement with the shape - normalized h1-excess ( see e.g. @xmath69 in ( left ) ) . while further reaching conclusions",

    "reliable portion _ of generated @xmath0-events ( with high @xmath87 ) is distributed in @xmath69 and in @xmath84 quite like the observed excess .    despite an improved overall agreement and understanding via such considerations , let us close this section with a reminder of the basic remaining problematics : the observed excess is strongly relying on monte carlo generators for _ normal _ dis events , and",
    "the @xmath0-signal is expected where the latter are not too well known / studied  .",
    "this section is devoted to some ongoing attempts towards a better understanding of the rle of larger - size instantons both in the qcd - vacuum and in high - energy ( diffractive ) scattering processes .",
    "the guidance from recent high - quality lattice simulations is indispensable in this regime , as will become evident next .",
    "let us start by considering again the high - quality ukqcd lattice data@xcite for the @xmath0-size distribution @xmath88 . unlike ( left ) , in the dimensionless quantity @xmath89 is now displayed versus @xmath90 , with @xmath91 fm being the ( empirical ) peak position .",
    "the lattice data in first of all illustrate the striking fact that larger - size instantons are dramatically suppressed in comparison to ( naive ) expectations from @xmath0-perturbation theory ( solid line ) .",
    "the peak position , @xmath92 , may be viewed as an important length scale , characterizing the fairly rapid breakdown of usual @xmath0-perturbation theory . it is clearly important , to ask what kind of underlying physics can give rise to such a rapid and dramatic change .",
    "the focus here will be on an intriguing , possible explanation@xcite in terms of a residual conformal _",
    "inversion symmetry_.    the reason for displaying the lattice data in versus @xmath90 was to make the virtually perfect @xmath93 self - evident in the lattice data .",
    "both the open data symbols , referring to the original data points , and the solid ones , involving inverted arguments according to ( [ inversion ] ) , seem to beautifully fit onto one universal , symmetric curve .",
    "the possibility of such an inversion symmetry is particularly appealing , since it may well be a `` relict '' from the well - known _ conformal invariance _ of the whole @xmath0-sector at the classical level@xcite .",
    "if true , such a symmetry would allow to access the non - perturbative regime of large - size instantons ( yet with _",
    "@xmath94 ) in terms of @xmath0-perturbation theory for instantons with _ small _ @xmath52 . it may well have also intriguing consequences beyond instanton physics for qcd in general , as we shall briefly speculate further below .",
    "the conformal symmetry group comprises besides the inhomogeneous lorentz group ( poincar invariance ) , scale transformations , @xmath95 , and the coordinate _ inversion : _ , @xmath96 the invariance under scale transformations is well - known to be broken at the quantum level via regularization / renormalization . a detailed and notably more rigorous discussion about the validity of the conformal inversion at the quantum level ( @xmath0-size distribution ! ) , would certainly lead beyond the scope of this talk and may be found elsewhere@xcite . yet , it may be instructive to sketch a few simple arguments from ref.@xcite .",
    "first of all , let us ask at the classical level , why a coordinate inversion ( [ coordinv ] ) indeed implies an inversion ( [ inversion ] ) of the instanton size",
    ". for simplicity , let us consider a pure su(2 ) yang - mills theory ( no fermions ) .",
    "starting from the familiar expression for the vector potential of an instanton in singular gauge ( gauge coupling g ) , @xmath97 involving the t hooft coefficients@xcite @xmath98 , one straightforwardly finds for the transformed vector field @xmath99 after a conformal coordinate inversion ( [ coordinv ] ) , @xmath100 apparently , the inversion ( [ coordinv ] ) transforms the vector potential in singular gauge of an instanton with size @xmath52 into the vector potential in regular gauge of an _ anti_-instanton with size @xmath101 ! using the conformal transformation law of the field - strengh tensor , @xmath102 on arrives after some calculation at the following ( gauge - independent ) transformation of the ( anti- ) instanton contribution to the lagrange density , @xmath103 which illustrates the @xmath0-size inversion ( [ inversion ] ) of interest as resulting from the coordinate inversion ( [ coordinv ] ) . upon integration over space - time one",
    "then explicitly checks the invariance of the @xmath0-action @xmath104 under coordinate inversion due to its independence of the @xmath0-size , @xmath105 the essential step , however , is to reconsider@xcite the derivation of the ( 1-loop ) vacuum - to - vacuum ( tunnelling ) amplitude@xcite about a single instanton that directly determinines the leading expression for the @xmath0-size distribution .",
    "the task is to compare the result for instantons with _ small _ @xmath52 to that for instantons with _ small _ @xmath94 .",
    "it turns out that the ( dominating ) _ zero - mode _ contribution indeed respects the inversion symmetry ( [ inversion ] ) , while a non - invariant piece due to the various non - zero mode determinants has been studied long ago@xcite , may be isolated and then divided out in form of the factor @xmath106 in .",
    "an important challenge in this approach relies in a better understanding of the significance of the inversion scale @xmath107 . while unbroken scale invariance would ( nonsensically ) make _ any value _ of @xmath92 physically equivalent , its breaking signalled by the non - vanishing trace of the energy - momentum tensor@xcite , @xmath108 , suggests @xmath109 .",
    "let us close with pointing out an intriguing possible consequence of such an inversion symmetry of the @xmath0-size distribution , that affects @xmath110 and thus qcd in general .",
    "let us follow ref.@xcite and define a ( non - perturbative ) `` @xmath111-scheme '' for @xmath112 , after identifying the renormalization scale @xmath39 as @xmath113 with @xmath114 , by the requirement that the familiar perturbative expression of @xmath115 $ ] be valid for all @xmath116 .",
    "surprisingly , the form of @xmath116 , implicitly defined by this prescription and directly extracted from a comparison with the ukqcd data@xcite , showed a cornell form @xmath117 for @xmath118 with string tension @xmath119 mev , while beautifully agreeing with the 3-loop perturbative form of @xmath120 for @xmath121 .",
    "taking here for the sake of simplicity the leading 1-loop expression for the @xmath0-size distribution@xcite , the inversion symmetry ( [ inversion ] ) of the quantity in implies @xmath122 we may explicitly solve for @xmath116 in terms of @xmath123 , which involves the lambert - w function , @xmath124 . by using the leading , asymptotically free form , for @xmath125 , the inversion symmetry ( [ inversion ] )",
    "then analytically leads again to a cornell form @xmath126 signalling confinement .",
    "more specifically , one may write down a simple and _ exact _ closed solution of , ( @xmath127 ) , @xmath128 which apparently now has `` inherited '' the inversion symmetry ( [ inversion ] ) , @xmath129 has _ no landau pole _ , the correct asymptotic freedom form for @xmath130 as well as a cornell form ( [ cornell ] ) for large @xmath52 .",
    "amazingly , this ( 1-loop ) form ( [ nesterenko ] ) of @xmath110 exists already in the literature@xcite , but originated from an entirely different reasoning .",
    "it appeared as the appropriate ( 1-loop ) running coupling without a landau pole in sort of a renormalization - group improved variant of shirkov s `` analytic perturbation theory''@xcite .",
    "larger - size instantons may well play an important rle in high - energy scattering processes@xcite and even be the driving configurations for diffractive scattering@xcite , i.e. the ( soft ) @xmath131omeron .      as a well - defined start towards these important , but complicated issues ,",
    "let us consider ( initially at least ) the dis regime where @xmath0-perturbation theory holds . in this region , we then have recast@xcite our published calculation of the simplest relevant @xmath0-induced process@xcite , @xmath133 , with one massless quark flavour into the language of the popular color - dipole picture@xcite ( c.f . ) .",
    "the intuitive content of the latter is that at high energies , in the proton s rest frame , the virtual photon fluctuates predominantly into a @xmath134 _ dipole _ a long distance upstream of the target proton .",
    "the large difference of the @xmath134-formation and @xmath135-@xmath136 interaction times then generically gives rise to the familiar factorized expression of the inclusive photon - proton cross sections @xmath137 in terms of the modulus squared of the photon s ( light - cone ) wavefunction @xmath138 and the @xmath135-@xmath136 dipole cross section @xmath139 .",
    "the important variables in are the transverse @xmath135-size @xmath140 and the photon momentum fraction @xmath141 carried by the quark .",
    "this dipole picture represents a convenient framework for discussing the transition from hard to soft physics ( diffraction ) , with expectations @xmath142 in the large @xmath73 regime , where @xmath0-perturbation holds , the @xmath0-contribution ( ) may indeed be cast approximately into a form ( [ dipole - cross ] ) and be compared to the familiar pqcd expression@xcite ( [ transition ] ) . for reasons of space ,",
    "let us just emphasize an emerging , striking feature : unlike the pqcd expression@xcite for @xmath139 , the required integrations over the @xmath143-sizes now bring unavoidably as further length scale the effective @xmath144-@xmath145 , @xmath146 , into the nominator that competes on dimensional grounds with the square of the transverse @xmath135-size @xmath147 for @xmath148 . since for a range of moderately high @xmath73 ,",
    "the effective @xmath0-size is dominated , however , by the peak - position @xmath149 fm of @xmath150 ( c.f . ) , the instanton in the background of the @xmath135-pair acts rather like an object of _ hadronic _ size and a roughly constant @xmath0-induced dipole cross section results , @xmath151 even for quite small @xmath135-size @xmath152 .",
    "a detailed analysis of the delicate interplay of these two crucial length scales may be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "thus , it seems that due to this precocious lack of `` color transparency '' , indeed , instanton configurations may well play a distinguished rle in building up diffractive high - energy scattering .",
    "all results on `` small instantons and deep - inelastic scattering '' ( section 2 ) have been obtained in long - term collaboration with andreas ringwald .",
