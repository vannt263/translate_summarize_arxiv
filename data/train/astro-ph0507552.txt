    "young stars with dusty disks and infalling envelopes can be identified by the thermal emission from the dust heated by the star . in the mid - infrared",
    ", the thermal emission can be detected as an excess over the expected photospheric emission , and we refer to stars exhibiting such an excess as infrared excess sources . we expect that more than 50% of all young ( @xmath11  myr ) stars exhibit infrared excesses ( ( * ? ? ? * haisch , lada & lada 2001 ) ) . using both theoretical models ( ( * ? ? ? * allen et al .",

    "however , identification of young stars using solely the irac data is limited by the lower sensitivity of the 5.8 and 8.0  @xmath8 m irac data to stellar photospheres . for this reason ,",

    "the selection of sources with infrared excesses eliminates contamination by normal field stars , but it does not eliminate contamination due the presence of other dusty objects in the sky . using an irac survey toward a field in the constellation bootes , @xcite found that agn previously identified through optical spectroscopy have colors similar to those of young stars with infrared excesses .",
    "however , the agn are typically fainter than the young stars in the irac bands . to reduce the contamination by agn",
    ", we required that the infrared excess sources be brighter than 14  mag . in the irac 3.6  @xmath8 m band .",

    "these are the two massive star forming regions in these clouds , and they are easily distinguished in the figure by the density of infrared excess sources in these regions .    the orion nebula cluster in fig",
    ".  2 . is part of an extended complex of star formation extending from ngc 1977 in the north , through the orion molecular cloud ( omc )  2 and 3 regions , through m42 and m43 ( the orion nebula cluster or onc ) , and finally to ngc 1980 in the south . at this point",
    "the density of stars decreases as we transition into the l1641 dark cloud . in l1641 , we find the known stellar groups l1641 north , v380 , l1641  center and l1641  south and an extended component which fills in much of the space between the groups . the stars are concentrated toward the northern edge of the cloud where the @xmath14co emission is strongest .",
    "the two fields surveyed in the orion b cloud show strikingly different distributions of stars . in the southern field containing ngc  2024 and ngc  2023 , the stars are concentrated in a single dense cluster in ngc  2024 , with a small group of stars associated with ngc  2023 and a small number of isolated stars . in the northern field containing ngc  2068 and ngc  2071 , we find that the two clusters are part of a more extended distribution of stars spanning from ngc  2071 through ngc  2068 and to the chain of protostars found in the lbs 23 core - which includes hh24 and mcneil s nebula .",

    "the different spatial distributions of young stars observed in the clouds is apparent in histograms of the local surface density of infrared excess sources . we calculate the local surface density for each infrared excess source by finding the distance to the 4th nearest infrared excess source , @xmath16 , and then equating the local surface density to @xmath17 .",
    "fig  4 shows the distributions of nearest neighbour densities for the two maps in the orion b cloud and for two sub - regions of the orion a cloud map . in ngc  2068/2071 and l1641 ,",
    "@xmath18 of the stars are in regions with stellar densities @xmath19  stars  pc@xmath20 , while in ngc  2023/2024 and the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) , more than @xmath21 of the stars have local densities @xmath22  stars  pc@xmath20 . in the onc ,",
    "this fraction is probably much larger since the data is incomplete in the center of the orion nebula where the stellar densities are the highest .",
    "ngc  2068/2071 shows a strong peak between 10 and 100  stars  pc@xmath20 , suggesting a more uniform distribution of stars compared with the other regions .",
    "interestingly , the regions showing dense , centrally condensed clusters are the two regions of the embedded molecular cloud population closest to the older orion 1c association ( see article by bally et al . in this volume ) , suggesting that the rate and/or density of star formation may be enhanced by the impact of ob stars on the molecular clouds .",
    "one of the goals of this survey is to determine the relative importance of clustered and isolated star formation in the orion molecular clouds ; however , distinguishing the clustered and distributed stars can be problematic . only in the ngc",
    "2023/2024 cloud are the clustered and distributed populations distinct , while in the other regions the clusters and groups appear to be density peaks in more extended populations . as a first step ,",
    "we calculate the number of stars in the two large , dense clusters in the orion and ngc  2024 regions relative to that in the remaining , lower density regions .",
    "we note that in the orion  b cloud , there are roughly the same number of infrared excess sources in the predominately clustered population of the ngc  2023/2024 sub - cloud as in the lower stellar density , more distributed population in the ngc  2068/2071 sub - cloud ( 239 vs. 229 , respectively ) . in the orion  a cloud , we find 607 infrared excess sources in l1641 , while north of @xmath23 , we find 1093 sources , 487 of which appear to be part of the onc , and the remaining 606 stars are associated with omc2/3 , ngc 1977 , ngc 1980 , and a more distributed component seen around the cluster .",
    "we estimate that we may be missing as many as 700 stars in the inner @xmath24 center of the orion nebula ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* muench et al . 1998 ) ) . in total",
    ", we estimate that there may be as many as 1200 stars with infrared excesses in the onc compared with 1213 in the regions surrounding the onc and in l1641 .",
