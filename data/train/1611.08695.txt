    "as raymond stora had written in his inimitable ironic style , he had _ contributed to the `` useful physics '' _ ( in his work with p. moussa on angular distributions in 2-particle reactions ) _ as well as to the `` useless '' quantum field theory ( qft ) , including the analysis of analytic properties of scattering amplitudes which follow from the causality principle _  in joint work with bros , epstein , glaser , messiah ( see , e.g. , [ egs ] ) .",
    "not surprisingly , our discussions at cern were devoted to the `` useless '' part .",
    "perturbative ultraviolet renormalization in qft was originally worked out for momentum space integrals beginning with a high energy cutoff . but a causal position space approach has also been developed concurrently by ernst stueckelberg , a swiss student of sommerfeld , starting in the early forties ( after a 1938 paper in german , anticipating the abelian higgs - kibble model , he switched to french - see [ s45 , s46 , sr , sp ] ) .",
    "this was taken up by a ( french reading ) mathematician , n. n. bogolubov [ b ] , who set himself to master qft ( while mobilized to work  with many others  on the russian atomic project ) . the russian work on renormalization ( referred to in the book [ bs ] ",
    "see , in particular , [ st ] ) , perfected by hepp [ he ] , zimmermann and lowenstein [ z , lz ] ( resulting in the /incomplete/ acronym bphz ) is still substantially using the traditional momentum space picture .",
    "even epstein and glaser [ eg ] , who set the stage for the position space renormalization program based on locality , were proving lorentz invariance of time - ordered products working in momentum space .",
    "it was only in [ ps ]  another famous unpublished preprint of raymond s  that the problem was translated into a cohomological position space argument ( see the historical survey in [ g - bl ] ) .",
    "this led gradually to viewing renormalization as a problem of extending distributions defined originally for non - coinciding arguments , an approach that , in the words of stora [ s ] , `` from a philosophical point of view , does not require the use  and the removal  of regularizations '' .",
    "the tortuous path from p- to x - space renormalization can be viewed , in modern parlance , as a duality transformation ( the good old fourier integral ) mapping a large momentum onto a small distance problem . as relativistic causality",
    "does not require the existence of a poincar invariant vacuum state , the stueckelberg - bogolubov - epstein - glaser - stora position space approach turned out to be the only one suited for the study of perturbative qft on a curved background ( which began flourishing during the last twenty years or so - see @xcite for recent reviews and references ) .",
    "our collaboration started with raymond reading sect .",
    "3.2 of the first volume of hrmander s treatise [ h ] and pointing out that it is tailor - made for renormalization of a massless theory .",
    "it is based on the observation that a density like @xmath1 is a meromorphic distribution valued function of @xmath2 with simple poles ( at @xmath3 above ) .",
    "subtracting the pole term , say at @xmath4 , we find a renormalized amplitude @xmath5 defined up to a distribution with support at the origin .",
    "the ambiguity can be restricted by demanding that this distribution has the same degree of homogeneity as the function @xmath6 away from the origin ( in our case @xmath7 ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath5 is associate homogeneous of degree @xmath7 and order one .",
    "more generally , a logarithmically divergent density @xmath8 of an n - dimensional argument @xmath9 defines an _ associate homogeneous distribution @xmath10 of degree @xmath11 and order @xmath12 _ if @xmath13 where the distributions @xmath14 can be viewed as generalized residues : @xmath15\\ , \\quad \\mathcal{e}= \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^n x^\\alpha\\partial_\\alpha,\\ ] ] satisfying @xmath16 for a feynman amplitude corresponding to a connected graph with @xmath17 vertices @xmath18 .",
    "the order @xmath12 of associate homogeneity corresponds to the number of ( sub)divergences of the amplitude .",
    "one proves that only the coefficient to the highest power of the logarithm , @xmath19\\delta(\\vec{x})\\ , \\ ] ] is independent of the ambiguity of renormalization .",
    "we start by sketching the recursive procedure of extending / renormalizing euclidean picture feynman amplitudes based on causal factorization .",
    "denote the propagator between the points @xmath20 and @xmath21 of @xmath22 by @xmath23 .",
    "we assume it to be a ( bounded at infinity ) smooth function away from the origin ( i.e. off the diagonal @xmath24 ) . in the case of a massless theory , treated in @xcite ,",
    "it is a rational homogeneous function of the type : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a homogeneous polynomial in the components @xmath27 of @xmath28 .",
    "( in a scalar qft @xmath29 . ) for the formulation of the _ principle of causal factorization _ one does not need the special form of the propagator .",
    "it sets a condition on a recursive ( with respect to the number of vertices ) procedure of _ renormalization _",
    "( i.e. extension ) of feynman amplitudes .",
    "let the index set @xmath30 of @xmath31 be split into any two non - empty non - intersecting subsets @xmath32 let @xmath33 .",
    "let further @xmath34 and @xmath35 be the renormalized distributions associated with the subgraphs whose vertices belong to the subsets @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "we demand that for each such splitting the extended _ euclidean _ distribution @xmath38 exhibits the _ factorization property _ : @xmath39 where @xmath40 are factors ( propagators ) in the feynman amplitude @xmath41 which are smooth in @xmath42 and can therefore be viewed as multipliers .",
    "* remark 1*. in the lorentzian signature case one demands that the points indexed by the set @xmath36 precede those of @xmath37 and uses wightman functions instead of @xmath40 in the counterpart of ( [ g12r ] ) ( see sect .",
    "2.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "in the case of a massless theory we add to this basic physical requirement two more _ mathematical conventions _ ( mc ) which restrict substantially the set of admissible renormalizations .",
    "( mc1 ) _ renormalization maps rational homogeneous functions onto associate homogeneous distributions of the same degree of homogeneity ; it extends associate homogeneous distributions defined off the small diagonal to associate homogeneous distributions of the same degree _ ( but possibly of higher order ) _ defined everywhere on @xmath43 . _",
    "( mc2 ) _ the renormalization map commutes with multiplication by polynomials . _ if we extend the class of our distributions by allowing multiplication with smooth functions of no more than polynomial growth ( in the domain of definition of the corresponding functionals ) , then this requirement will imply commutativity of the renormalization map with such multipliers .",
    "the induction is based on the following _ diagonal lemma_.    * proposition 1*. _ the complement @xmath44 of the small diagonal is the union of all @xmath42 for all pairs of disjoint @xmath45 with @xmath46 , i.e. , @xmath47 _    * proof .",
    "* let @xmath48 .",
    "then there are at least two different points @xmath49 .",
    "we define @xmath36 as the set of all indices @xmath50 of @xmath51 for which @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "hence , @xmath44 is included in the union of all such pairs .",
    "each @xmath42 , on the other hand , is defined to belong to @xmath54 .",
    "this completes the proof of our statement .    *",
    "remark 2*. for a more general combinatorial `` diagonal lemma '' that serves both the euclidean and the minkowski space framework allowing to complete each step of the renormalization by the extension of a distribution defined outside the full diagonal - see theorem a1 of [ nst ] .",
    "the above recursive procedure allows to reduce the elimination of divergences to the renormalization of primitively divergent graphs . we shall again survey this step in the case of a euclidean massless qft .",
    "a feynman amplitude @xmath55 is then a homogeneous function of @xmath56 .",
    "it is _ superficially divergent _ if @xmath10 defines a density in @xmath57 of a non - positive degree of homogeneity : @xmath58 @xmath59 is called the ( superficial ) _ degree of divergence_.    * proposition 2 . * _ for any primitively divergent @xmath55 and smooth ( semi)norm @xmath60 on @xmath57 ( allowed to vanish on a cone of lower dimension ) one has @xmath61^\\epsilon g(\\vec{x } ) -\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}(res\\ , g)(\\vec{x } ) = g^\\rho(\\vec{x } ) + o(\\epsilon).\\ ] ] here @xmath62 is a distribution with support at the origin .",
    "its calculation is reduced to the case @xmath63 of a logarithmically divergent graph by using the identity @xmath64 where summation is assumed ( from 1 to n ) over the repeated indices @xmath65 .",
    "if @xmath10 is homogeneous of degree @xmath11 then @xmath66 here the numerical residue @xmath67 is given by an integral over the hypersurface @xmath68 : @xmath69 ( a hat over an argument meaning , as usual , that this argument is omitted ) .",
    "the residue @xmath67 is independent of the ( transverse to the dilation ) surface @xmath70 since the form in the integrand is closed in the projective space @xmath71 . _    we note that n is even , in fact divisible by 4 , so that @xmath71 is orientable .    *",
    "remark 3*. the use of a homogeneous ( semi)norm as a regulator ( a relative of _ analytic regularization _",
    "@xcite ) is more flexible than dimensional regularization and should be also applicable in the presence of a chiral anomaly .",
    "the functional @xmath67 is a _ period _ according to the definition of kontsevich and zagier @xcite .",
    "the convention of accompanying the 4d volume @xmath72 by a @xmath73 factor ( @xmath74 being the volume of the unit sphere @xmath75 in four dimensions ) helps display the number theoretic character of residues . for one and two - loop graphs in a massless theory they are just rational numbers . for three , four and five loops in the @xmath0 theory",
    "all residues are integer multiples of @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "the first double zeta value , @xmath78 , appears at six loops ( with a rational coefficient ) ( see the census of schnetz who calls such residues _ quantum periods _",
    "all _ known _ residues were ( up to 2013 ) rational linear combinations of multiple zeta values of overall weight not exceeding @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "a seven loop graph was recently demonstrated @xcite to involve _ multiple deligne values _ ",
    "i.e. , values of _ hyperlogarithms _ at sixth roots of unity . an infinite series of @xmath2-loop primitive @xmath0 4-point _ zig - zag graphs _ were conjectured by broadhurst and kreimer [ bk ] and proven by brown and schnetz [ bs12 ] to be proportional to @xmath80 with calculable rational coefficients ( equal to @xmath81 for @xmath82 ",
    "see @xcite for an elementary derivation and further references ) .",
    "in the adiabatic procedure of bogolubov et al . all vertices are treated as external : each coupling constant @xmath83 is substituted by a vanishing at infinity test function @xmath84 .",
    "this is essential for the formulation of causal factorization .",
    "integration over internal vertices corresponds to the adiabatic limit ( @xmath85 ) and does not keep track of localization .",
    "it is rewarding to understand that such an integration commutes with renormalization and hence does not pose a problem in a conformally invariant theory like @xmath0 in @xmath86 , @xcite ( thus elucidating an old result , @xcite ) .    we shall sketch the basic idea using schnetz s _ vacuum completion _ @xmath87 of a 4-point graph @xmath31 ( in which the four external edges are joined together in a new `` vertex at infinity '' - @xcite ) .",
    "the introduction of this concept is justified by the following result ( proposition 2.6 and theorem 2.7 of @xcite ) :    * proposition 3 . * _ a 4-regular vacuum graph @xmath87 ( with five or more vertices ) is said to be completed primitive if the only way to split it by a four edge cut is by splitting off one vertex .",
    "a 4-point feynman amplitude corresponding to a connected 4-regular graph @xmath31 is primitively divergent iff its completion @xmath87 is completed primitive .",
    "all 4-point graphs with the same primitive completion have the same residue . _    there are infinitely many primitive 4-point graphs ( while there is a single primitive 2-point self - energy graph ) .",
    "* proposition 4*. _ the period of a completed primitive graph @xmath87 is equal to the residue of each 4-point graph @xmath88 ( obtained from @xmath87 by cutting off an arbitrary vertex @xmath89 ) .",
    "the resulting common period can be evaluated from @xmath87 by choosing arbitrarily three vertices @xmath90 , setting all propagators corresponding to edges of the type @xmath91 equal to 1 and integrating over the remaining @xmath92 vertices of @xmath31 ( @xmath93 ) : @xmath94 _ _ sketch of proof_. for a given choice of the vertex at infinity ( [ per ] ) follows from ( [ res ] ) .",
    "the independence of the choice of the point at infinity follows from conformal invariance .",
    "we note , for instance , that the conformal inversion @xmath95 , exchanges the ( arbitrarily chosen ) @xmath96 and @xmath97 while the integral remains invariant since @xmath98    it is the freedom of choice of the vertices to which one ascribes the values @xmath99 in propositon 4 ( as a consequence of conformal invariance ) that guarantees the commutativity between renormalization and integration with respect to internal vertices .",
    "one can illustrate this fact on the four - loop graph of fig .",
    "1 with a single internal vertex @xmath28 ( the black dot in the middle of the figure ) .        the simplest way to calculate the residue of the corresponding amplitude @xmath100 consists in setting @xmath101 ( rather than integrating in x ) .",
    "the result appears as a special case ( for @xmath102 ) of the _ wheel with @xmath2 spokes _ expressed in terms of the classical polylogarithm @xcite : @xmath103 if , on the other hand , one first integrates with respect to @xmath28 ( expressing @xmath100 in terms of the bloch - wigner dilogarithm ) then the residue is calculated in terms of multipolylogarithms of higher depth @xcite but the final answer is the same - as a consequence of conformal invariance .",
    "the renormalized feynman amplitude @xmath104 of an arbitrary primitively divergent 4-point graph is an associate homogeneous distribution of order one ( and degree twelve in the generic case when there is a single external edge at each external vertex ) : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a 1-cocycle ( normalized by @xmath107 ) : @xmath108    graphs with subdivergences give rise to associate homogeneous amplitudes of higher order .",
    "the generalized residue @xmath109 ( [ rn ] ) appearing as coefficient to the highest power of @xmath110 can be computed in terms of the residues of the divergent subgraphs and of the corresponding quotient graphs .",
    "we shall illustrate this fact on the example of the graph on fig . 1 in which the central point is substituted by a generic primitively divergent 4-point subgraph with amplitude @xmath111 @xmath112 the dilation law for @xmath113",
    ", @xmath114 implies that the dilation anomaly of @xmath115 for non - coinciding arguments is @xmath116 where @xmath100 is given by @xmath117 it follows that the coefficient @xmath118 to @xmath119 , which is independent of the renormalization ambiguity , is given by the product of residues : @xmath120    a renormalized primitively divergent 4-point graph also has a calculable conformal anomaly . under the special conformal transformation @xmath121 the renormalized amplitude @xmath10 obeys the following counterpart of ( [ 4ptdil ] ) : @xmath122 the @xmath123-function ensures that the result is independent of the choice of @xmath124 in the last factor .",
    "the cocycle condition that implements the group law is satisfied because of the identity @xmath125",
    "there is a parallel between studying renormalzation of a _ massless _ qft and neglecting friction by the founders of modern physics  starting with galileo .",
    "both idealizations allow to grasp the essence of the problem .",
    "introducing friction in classical mechanics , and masses in the analysis of small distance behavior seems to be just adding technical details to the general picture .",
    "raymond , however , _ did worry _ about masses in qft renormalization .",
    "recent work @xcite on a simple 2-point amplitude with arbitrary non - zero masses illustrates the arising complications . nevertheless , the causal position space approach to renormalization wworks in this general case as well @xcite .",
    "the study of feynman periods , an essential ingredient of renormalization theory ( sect .",
    "3 ) , is bringing a new insight in a lively area of number theory ( see @xcite for recent developments in this subject ) .",
    "as we see , and work in the last couple of decades , surveyed , e.g. in @xcite , amply confirms , `` useless '' local qft continues to serve both high energy physics and its healthy interaction with modern mathematics .",
