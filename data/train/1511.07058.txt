    "a century ago , albert einstein completed the general theory of relativity in his conclusive paper submitted on 25 november 1915 and published on 2 december 1915 @xcite .",
    "einstein s theory then became an accepted theory of gravity .",
    "in general relativity the space - time geometry @xmath4 ( metric tensor ) is the gravitational field described by the action@xmath5where @xmath6 is the gravitational constant , @xmath7 is the speed of light and @xmath8 is the ricci tensor . the second term in eq .",
    "( [ agr ] ) describes interaction between gravitational field and matter with the rest mass density @xmath9 .",
    "variation of the action ( [ agr ] ) with respect to @xmath4 yields einstein equations@xmath10where @xmath11 is the energy - momentum tensor of matter .",
    "einstein equations ( [ i1 ] ) are a consequence of the postulate that space - time geometry @xmath12 is gravitational field .",
    "one should mention that so far general relativity was tested only at weak gravitational field @xcite and thus it is not a theory fully confirmed experimentally .",
    "observations of binary pulsars yet have not provided a test of general relativity at strong gravity . even though neutron stars in the binary systems are relativistic objects , they are sufficiently well - separated and all aspects of their orbital behavior and gravitational wave generation in general relativity are characterized only by their net masses and angular momentum . as a result , observations of binary pulsars tested einstein equations for weak time - dependent field and also the equivalence principle which guarantees effacement of the bodies ( relativistic ) internal structure .",
    "one should note , however , that strong internal gravitational fields of neutron stars can affect orbital dynamics and gravitational wave generation in alternative theories of gravity that violate the strong equivalence principle @xcite . only in this",
    "sense observations of binary pulsars is a test of strong gravity .    in 1998 ,",
    "published observations of type ia supernovae by the high - z supernova search team @xcite followed in 1999 by the supernova cosmology project @xcite suggested that the expansion of the universe is accelerating .",
    "since then , these observations have been corroborated by several independent sources .",
    "measurements of the cosmic microwave background , gravitational lensing , and the large - scale structure of the cosmos as well as improved measurements of supernovae have been consistent with the lambda - cdm model , which is the current standard model of cosmology . according to this model , a mysterious dark energy gives the main contribution to the universe composition .",
    "work done in 2013 based on the planck spacecraft observations of the cosmic microwave background gave the most accurate estimate of about 68% of dark energy  in the universe planck14 .",
    "there are several unwanted issues about general relativity .",
    "e.g. , it is not compatible with quantum theory , it can not explain why universe is spatially flat , it does not provide a mechanism of matter generation at the big bang and it can not explain the value of the cosmological term ( mysterious dark energy ) .",
    "it also predicts existence of singularities such as black holes when a massive star collapses into a point with zero volume and infinite matter density .",
    "one can argue that general relativity becomes invalid in the vicinity of singularities and a quantum theory of gravity will remove them .",
    "in contrast , the present theory is free of such singularities at the classical level .",
    "one should mention that black holes have never been observed directly and evidences  of their existence are based on the presumption that general relativity describes gravity for strong field .    here",
    "we propose an alternative classical theory of gravity which is a lagrangian - based vector field theory in fixed four dimensional euclidean space .",
    "the present vector theory is a metric theory of gravity @xcite which means that space - time is endowed with a symmetric equivalent metric @xmath13 formed out of the vector field and euclidean metric .",
    "matter and nongravitational fields respond only to the spacetime metric @xmath14 .",
    "the world lines of test bodies are geodesics of that metric and in local freely falling frames the nongravitational laws of physics are those of special relativity .",
    "our theory is prior - geometric for it contains the fixed background euclidean geometry ( euclidean metric ) and gravity is a dynamical four - vector field in this geometry which generates the space - time curvature ( equivalent metric @xmath15 ) .",
    "we show that vector theory of gravity passes all available tests . at strong field",
    "our theory substantially deviates from general relativity and yields no black holes .",
    "for cosmology the present theory gives the same evolution of the universe as general relativity with cosmological constant and zero spatial curvature .",
    "however , zero spatial curvature of the universe is a solution of our equations , while in general relativity the spatial curvature is a free parameter .",
    "moreover , the vector theory of gravity yields , with no free parameters , the value of the cosmological constant @xmath16 which agrees with the recent planck result @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "such striking agreement is a strong argument in favor of the vector nature of gravity",
    ".    physical explanation of the dark energy ( cosmological term ) in our theory is the following .",
    "expansion of the universe yields change of spatial scale with time which can be viewed as an increase of the distance between masses .",
    "this generates matter current directed away from an observer .",
    "such current induces vector ( spatial ) components of the gravitational field in a similar way as electric current creates vector potential in classical electrodynamics .",
    "average energy of the vector gravitational field induced by the universe expansion is the mysterious dark energy .",
    "contrary to matter , it has negative energy density and accelerates expansion of the universe .",
    "vector gravity also suggests a mechanism of matter generation at the big bang without involving an additional hypothetical field ( inflaton ) .",
    "namely , matter was created at the expense of production of negative energy gravitons and the gravitational field itself caused the stage of inflation and heated up the universe . according to the vector gravity , the total energy of the universe ( which includes the energy of matter and gravitational field ) is equal to zero .",
    "another remarkable feature of our theory is that equations for gravitational field can be solved analytically for arbitrary static mass distribution ( see sec .",
    "[ static ] ) . if point masses are located at @xmath18 , @xmath19 , ",
    "@xmath20 then exact solution for the equivalent metric is @xmath21where @xmath22and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) are constants determined by the value of masses .",
    "solution ( [ x4 ] ) is free of black holes . in recent years",
    ", the evidence for the existence of ultra - compact supermassive objects at centers of galaxies has become very strong .",
    "it is important to note that present solution ( [ x4 ] ) not only argues that such objects are not black holes , but also can explain quantitatively their observed properties and give us a hint about composition of dark matter ( see sec .",
    "[ dark ] and ref .",
    "svid07 ) .",
    "before we proceed with building the vector theory of gravity we discuss an algorithm that we use to construct the theory .",
    "classical electrodynamics is an example of a successful field theory which is very well tested .",
    "it postulates that electromagnetic field is a four dimensional vector @xmath0 in minkowski space - time .",
    "the conserved @xmath25current density @xmath26 is the source of the electromagnetic field which is coupled to @xmath0 through the lorentz invariant term in the action@xmath27    such postulate allows us to construct classical electrodynamics in a unique way using symmetries of eq .",
    "( [ se ] ) .",
    "namely , conservation of current yields that @xmath28 is invariant under the gauge transformation @xmath29 .",
    "action for the electromagnetic field @xmath30 must possess the same symmetries as the coupling term @xmath28 , namely , it must be lorentz and gauge invariant .",
    "such a requirement , together with the condition that @xmath31 must be quadratic in field derivatives yields a unique answer for @xmath32@xmath33    variation of the total action of the system @xmath34 with respect to @xmath0 yields maxwell equations and variation with respect to the particle trajectories gives the lorentz force .",
    "thus , the whole classical electrodynamics is uniquely assembled from the structure of the coupling term ( [ se ] ) .    in the next sections we will use the same algorithm to construct the classical vector theory of gravity .",
    "namely , first we postulate how the gravitational field is coupled to matter .",
    "then , using symmetries of the coupling term , we uniquely assemble the total action and obtain the field equations from the variational principle .",
    "one should note that symmetries of the coupling term in vector gravity are very different from the symmetries of eq .",
    "( [ se ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the vector theory of gravity substantially differs from classical electrodynamics .",
    "when we make a transition from the classical to quantum electrodynamics we must make an additional assumption , namely , that the quantum of the vector filed @xmath0 , the photon , is an elementary particle .",
    "this postulate yields that photon is a boson because fermion field does not transform as a vector .",
    "however , a product of two fermion fields can transform as a vector .",
    "e.g. , a four - vector field @xmath0 can be created from a fermion - antifermion pair as @xcite @xmath35where @xmath36 are @xmath37 gamma matrices and @xmath38 is the fermion field . in this regard",
    "there is an interesting proposal that the photon is not an elementary particle but rather a composite particle formed of a fermion - antifermion pair ( the so called neutrino theory of light ) .",
    "the idea that the photon is a composite particle dates back to 1932 , when louis de broglie @xcite suggested that the photon is composed of a neutrino - antineutrino pair bound together .",
    "work on the neutrino theory of light continues to be of some interest dvoe01,perk02,sen07,perk13,perk14 .",
    "the neutrino theory of light teaches us an important lesson .",
    "namely , it shows that , as in the case of an elementary particle photon , the expectation values of the electric and magnetic field operators for the composite photon also obey classical maxwell equations @xcite .",
    "this result is also valid for quantum states of light .",
    "that is classical maxwell equations properly describe electromagnetism even if photon is a composite particle and its constituent fermion fields are not classical . whether the photon is an elementary particle or a composite particle matters for the boundary and initial conditions in the maxwell equations and affects the photon statistics .",
    "e.g. , the composite photon does not exactly obey bose - einstein statistics , although the non - bose terms could be very small to be detected in available experiments @xcite .",
    "the present paper deals with the vector gravity , rather than photons .",
    "however , as we show , the measured value of the energy loss by binary stars due to emission of gravitational waves can be explained in the vector gravity only if the quantum of the vector gravitational field ( the graviton ) is a composite particle formed of a fermion - antifermion pair .",
    "this fact makes a link between vector gravity and the neutrino theory of light .",
    "such a connection indicates that the classical theory of gravity we are proposing must be valid even though the fermion fields that compose the graviton are not classical . in particular ,",
    "classical equations for the gravitational field that we obtain must properly describe vector gravity , while the quantum nature of the constituent fermions manifests itself in the initial and boundary conditions .",
    "the present vector theory of gravity is based on four postulates :    * 1 .",
    "* background geometry of the universe is a fixed four dimensional euclidean space with metric @xmath39diag@xmath40 .",
    "such space is completely isotropic and has no preferred directions .",
    "* 2 . * in the four dimensional euclidean space there is a dynamical @xmath25vector field @xmath0 ( the gravitational field ) which breaks the symmetry .",
    "namely , direction of @xmath0 is now preferred and this direction becomes the time coordinate .",
    "directions perpendicular to @xmath0 are three spatial coordinates .",
    "* 3 . * vector gravitational field is coupled to matter and all nongravitational fields through the equivalent metric @xmath1 which is an algebraic function of @xmath0 and the background euclidean metric @xmath41 .",
    "gravitational field couples universally and minimally to all the fields of the standard model by replacing everywhere the minkowski metric @xmath42 with equivalent metric @xmath15 and replacing partial derivatives with covariant derivatives formed from @xmath1 . in particular , the trajectories of freely falling bodies are geodesics of the equivalent metric @xmath15 .",
    "action for a point particle with mass @xmath43 moving in the gravitational field reads@xmath44where @xmath7 is the speed of light .",
    "action ( [ d1 ] ) has the same form as in general relativity , however , the tensor gravitational field @xmath4 of general relativity is now replaced with the equivalent metric @xmath1 .",
    "one should note that the einstein equivalence principle is a consequence of the action ( [ d1 ] ) .",
    "the quantum of the vector field @xmath0 ( the graviton ) is not an elementary particle , but rather it is a composite particle formed of a massless fermion - antifermion pair .",
    "emission and absorption of a graviton corresponds to creation and annihilation of a particle - antiparticle pair .    for construction of the classical equations for the vector field",
    "@xmath0 it does not matter whether the graviton is an elementary particle or a composite particle .",
    "however , selection of physical solutions of the classical equations might depend on the graviton composition .",
    "the present vector theory of gravity can quantitatively explain the energy loss by binary stars orbiting each other provided that graviton is a composite particle ( this demands to select advanced , rather than retarded , potential as a solution of the wave equation ) .",
    "the postulates 1 - 3 outlined above allow us to construct the classical vector theory of gravity in a unique way using symmetries of the action @xmath45 ( [ d1 ] ) .",
    "such symmetries uniquely specify the structure of the total action .",
    "we proceed with assembling the theory in the next sections .",
    "in appendix [ ap1 ] we show that einstein equivalence principle yields the following unique expression for the equivalent metric @xmath1 in terms of the vector field @xmath0 and the background euclidean metric @xmath46@xmath47where @xmath48    throughout the paper we use the usual conventions .",
    "namely , unless otherwise noted , there is summation over repeated indices .",
    "lower case latin indices ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , ... ) label four dimensional coordinates ( range @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) , while lower case greek letters @xmath56 and @xmath57 denote spatial coordinates ( range @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath58 ) .    in cartesian coordinate system",
    "if we chose @xmath59axis along the direction of @xmath0 the equivalent metric is diagonal and reads@xmath60    since @xmath0 is a dynamical variable one can make a transformation @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is an arbitrary function of @xmath63 .",
    "such a transformation changes the norm of @xmath0 .",
    "it also modifies the expression for the metric ( [ d2 ] ) and field equations .",
    "however , the physical answer , e.g. , motion of particles in gravitational field is independent of how we normalize the vector field .",
    "thus , we can choose the field normalization in any suitable way .    instead of @xmath0 , it is convenient to introduce new independent functions , a scalar @xmath64 and a unit vector @xmath65 , according to the relations @xmath66the vector @xmath65 has the unit norm @xmath67 in terms of the unit vector @xmath65 and the scalar @xmath64 the equivalent metric ( [ d2 ] ) reads@xmath68while metric @xmath69 inverse to @xmath1 , defined as @xmath70 , is@xmath71where @xmath72 in the present paper rasing and lowering of the indices is performed using euclidean metric @xmath46 , unless otherwise stated . we denote determinant of @xmath1 as @xmath73 .",
    "equation ( [ met ] ) yields @xmath74    one should note that in the literature there were attempts to construct a vector theory of gravity in background minkowski ( rather than euclidean ) metric @xmath75diag@xmath76 by rastall @xcite and by the author @xcite .",

    "( [ met ] ) in which euclidean metric @xmath41 is replaced with @xmath77 and @xmath78 is replaced with @xmath79 .",
    "however , the main achievement of the present paper compared to the previous work on vector gravity is the discovery of the correct way of building the action for the gravitational field @xmath80 based on symmetries of the coupling term @xmath81 . in the previous attempts to construct the theory",

    "one should note that studies carried out in the wake of the discovery of the hulse - taylor binary pulsar in 1974 @xcite revealed that a number of otherwise respectable alternative theories of gravity predicted the emission of the negative energy @xcite .",
    "once the orbital period of the binary pulsar was shown to decrease in response to the emission of gravitational waves ( that is total energy of the binary system decreases with time ) , these theories were ruled out . since in the present theory the graviton energy is negative , the vector theory of gravity would also predict emission of the negative energy by binary pulsars if we would not postulate that graviton is composed of a fermion - antifermion pair by analogy with the neutrino theory of light .",

    "<S> however , the present theory provides explanation of the dark energy as energy of gravitational field induced by the universe expansion and yields , with no free parameters , the value of @xmath2 which agrees with the recent planck result @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> such striking agreement with cosmological data indicates that gravity has a vector , rather than tensor , origin . </S>",
    "<S> vector gravity can be tested by making more accurate measurement of the time delay of radar signal traveling near the sun , by improving accuracy of the light deflection experiments or measuring polarization of gravitational waves which differs from those in general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> resolving the supermassive object at the center of our galaxy with vlba could provide another possible test of gravity and also shed light on the nature of dark matter as we argued in jcap * 10 * , 018 ( 2007 ) . </S>"
