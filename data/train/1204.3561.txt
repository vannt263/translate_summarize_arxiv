    "supesymmetric extension is a good candidate for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is the simplest extension .",
    "the mssm is quite interesting because of its minimality and its detailed studies have been done for several aspects .",
    "however , the mssm has the fine - tuning problem . within the framework of the mssm , the @xmath4-boson mass , @xmath5 ,",
    "is obtained as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the soft supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking scalar mass squared of the up - sector higgs field and @xmath1 is the supersymmetric mass . the radiative corrections on @xmath7 are obtained as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the stop and gluino masses , respectively . in",
    "most of cases , the stop and the gluino masses are much larger than @xmath5 .",
    "thus , we need fine - tuning between @xmath7 and @xmath11 to realize the correct value of @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , it is required that @xmath12 tev or larger in order to obtain the higgs mass such as @xmath13 gev which is recently reported by atlas and cms collaborations@xcite .",
    "the mirage mediation is one of the interesting mediation mechanisms of susy breaking @xcite .",
    "the mirage mediation is a mixture of the modulus mediation @xcite and the anomaly mediation @xcite with a certain ratio .",
    "in particular , it was pointed out that the tev - scale mirage mediation can ameliorate the above fine - tuning problem of the mssm @xcite . in the tev - scale mirage mediation , the above radiative corrections on @xmath7 and",
    "the anomaly mediation contributions are canceled each other .",
    "then , the value of @xmath14 at the electroweak scale can be smaller than stop and gluino masses .",
    "the tev scale mirage mediation also leads several phenomenologically interesting aspects @xcite because its susy particle spectrum is quite compressed .",
    "the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) is the extension of the mssm by adding a singlet @xmath15 @xcite ( see for review e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "here , we also impose the @xmath16 symmetry .",
    "the nmssm does not have the @xmath1-term , @xmath17 , in the superpotential , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote the up and the down - sector higgs superfields , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the term @xmath20 is allowed in the nmssm superpotential .",
    "after @xmath15 develops its vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , the effective @xmath1-term is generated .",
    "that gives us a solution for the so - called @xmath1-problem @xcite .",
    "the nmssm is also interesting in the light of the recent indication of the relatively heavy higgs boson reported by atlas and cms , endowed with an additional higgs self - coupling . in the higgs sector , the doublet higgs and singlet fields mix each other .",
    "then , the higgs sector in the nmssm has a quite rich structure .",
    "the nmssm also leads the same relation as ( [ eq : mz - hu ] ) , and the nmssm has the fine - tuning problem similar to the one in the mssm .",
    "thus , it is interesting to apply the tev - scale mirage mediation to the nmssm . in this paper",
    ", we study the nmssm with the soft susy breaking terms induced through the tev - scale mirage mediation @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we give a brief review on the mirage mediation , and the tev scale mirage mediation . in section 3 , we apply the tev scale mirage mediation to the nmssm , and study its spectrum .",
    "section 4 is devoted to conclusion and discussion . in appendix",
    "a , we show explicitly initial conditions of soft parameters , which are induced through the mirage mediation in the nmssm .",
    "here , we review briefly the mirage mediation @xcite . the mirage mediation is the mixture between the modulus mediation and the anomaly mediation .",
    "then , the gaugino masses are obtained as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the gauge couplings and their @xmath24 function coefficients , and @xmath25 denotes the gravitino mass .",
    "the first and the second terms in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gaugino - mass ] ) correspond to the contributions due to the modulus mediation and the anomaly mediation , respectively .",
    "similarly , we obtain the so - called @xmath26-terms corresponding to the yukawa couplings , @xmath27 , and the soft scalar masses @xmath28 as @xmath29 where @xmath30 here , @xmath31 denotes the quadratic casimir corresponding to the representation of the matter field @xmath32 .",
    "in addition , @xmath33 and @xmath34 parametrize the a - term and the scalar mass squared generated through the modulus mediation in the unit of the universal gaugino mass , @xmath35 .",
    "these coefficients are determined by modulus - dependence of the khler metric as well as the yukawa coupling .",
    "one can write @xmath34 as @xmath36 here , @xmath37 is calculated from the tree - level khler metric of the matter field @xmath32 and they are ratios of small integers including @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath40 is obtained with the one - loop khler metric of the matter field , but such a loop correction to the khler metric depends on the detail of the ultraviolet - model and is hard to calculate ( see e.g. ref .",
    "that is , @xmath34 is ambiguous at the one - loop level , although such ambiguity is subdominant and less important in most of cases . here , we consider the case with @xmath41 we input the values of @xmath34 at @xmath42 gev .",
    "it is convenient to use the following parameter @xcite , @xmath43 to represent the ratio of the anomaly mediation to the modulus mediation . here",
    "@xmath44 is the reduced planck scale .",
    "one of the interesting aspects in the mirage mediation is that the above spectrum and has a special energy scale , that is , the mirage scale , @xmath45 at this scale , the gaugino masses are obtained as @xcite , @xmath46 that is , the anomaly mediation contribution and the radiative corrections cancel each other , and the pure modulus mediation appears at the mirage scale .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath26-terms and the scalar masses squared also satisfy and @xmath47 are chosen .",
    "however , such a modification is small and can be included in ambiguities of @xmath34 if couplings are small .",
    "see @xcite for detailed discussions .",
    "we include this contribution in our numerical analysis . ]",
    "@xmath48 if the corresponding yukawa couplings are small enough or if the following conditions are satisfied , @xmath49 for non - vanishing yukawa couplings , @xmath27 @xcite .    when @xmath50 , the mirage scale @xmath51 is around @xmath39 tev",
    ". then , the above spectrum ( [ eq : gaugino - mir ] ) and ( [ eq : a - m - mir ] ) is obtained at the tev scale .",
    "that is the tev scale mirage mediation scenario . in particular",
    ", there would appear a large gap between @xmath35 and the scalar mass @xmath28 with @xmath52 .",
    "we will apply the tev scale mirage scenario to the nmssm in the next section .    in the tev scale mirage scenario ,",
    "the stop mass squared becomes negative at high energy @xcite , while it is positive at low energy below @xmath53 gev .",
    "thus , the vacuum which breaks the electroweak symmetry at the electroweak scale might be a local minimum , but instead there would be a color and/or charge breaking vacuum with field values larger than @xmath53 gev . here , we assume the thermal history of the universe such that field values remain around the origin until the temperature reaches the electroweak scale .",
    "in addition , we need to confirm that the tunnelling rate is small enough , i.e. less than the hubble expansion rate . in refs .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that such a rate is small enough , as long as the squark / slepton masses squared are vanishing or positive around @xmath54 gev .",
    "this condition is satisfied in our tev scale mirage mediation scenario .",
    "in this section , we apply the tev scale mirage mediation scenario to the nmssm .      here , we briefly review on the nmssm , in particular its higgs sector before we apply the tev scale mirage mediation scenario to the nmssm . in the nmssm , we extend the mssm by adding a singlet chiral multiplet @xmath15 and imposing a @xmath16 symmetry .",
    "then , the superpotential of the higgs sector is written as @xmath55 here and hereafter , for @xmath15 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 we use the convention that the superfield and its lowest component are denoted by the same letter .",
    "the full superpotential also includes the yukawa coupling terms between the matter fields and the higgs fields , which are the same as those in the mssm .",
    "the following soft susy breaking terms are induced in the higgs sector , @xmath56 then , the scalar potential of the neutral higgs fields is given as @xmath57 with @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 denote the gauge couplings of u(1)@xmath61 and su(2 ) .",
    "the minimum of the potential is obtained by analyzing the stationary conditions of the higgs potential ,    @xmath62    [ eq:1 ]    where @xmath63 . here , we denote vevs as @xmath64 using the above stationary conditions , we obtain the @xmath4 boson mass @xmath65 as @xmath66 where @xmath67 . for @xmath68 ,",
    "this equation becomes @xmath69 this relation is the same as the one in the mssm .",
    "indeed , when we neglect the second term in the right - hand side , the above relation is nothing but eq .",
    "( [ eq : mz - hu ] ) .",
    "thus , the natural values of @xmath70 and @xmath71 would be of @xmath72 gev .",
    "furthermore , the natural value of @xmath73 would be of @xmath72 gev or smaller .",
    "alternatively , @xmath71 and @xmath73 could be larger than @xmath72 gev when @xmath74 and @xmath75 are canceled each other in the above relation at a certain level .",
    "even in such a case , @xmath70 would be naturally of @xmath72 gev .",
    "on the other hand , other sfermion masses as well as gaugino masses must be heavy as the recent lhc results suggested . to realize such a spectrum , we apply the tev scale mirage mediation in the next section , where we take @xmath76 to realize a suppressed value of @xmath70 compared with @xmath35 .      here , we study the tev scale mirage mediation scenario in the nmssm .",
    "soft susy breaking terms are obtained through the generic formulas ( [ eq : gaugino - mass ] ) and ( [ eq : a - m ] ) with taking @xmath50 . for concreteness ,",
    "we give explicit results of all the soft susy breaking terms for the nmssm in appendix [ app : soft ] .",
    "we concentrate on the higgs sector as well as gauginos and stops .",
    "we consider the following values of @xmath34 , @xmath77 for @xmath19 , @xmath18 , @xmath15 , and left and right - handed ( s)top fields , respectively .",
    "this is the same assignment as the pattern ii in ref .",
    "@xcite for the mssm except for @xmath78 .",
    "then , the soft parameters due to only modulus mediation contribution are given by @xmath79 when we neglect @xmath40 .",
    "the above assignment of @xmath34 ( [ eq : ci ] ) satisfies the condition , ( [ eq : mir - condition ] ) for the top yukawa coupling and the coupling @xmath80 , but not for the coupling @xmath81 .",
    "however , we do not consider a large value of @xmath81 to avoid the blow - up of @xmath81 and @xmath80 as will be shown later .",
    "thus , we obtain the following values , @xmath82 up to @xmath83 at the tev scale .",
    "note that @xmath40 has negligible effects for these values .",
    "similarly , we can obtain the values of @xmath84 , @xmath70 and @xmath85 at the tev scale , however those are suppressed compared with @xmath35 . for such suppressed values , sub - leading corrections e.g. the one - loop correction on the khler metric are not negligible anymore .",
    "that introduces one - loop ambiguity into the model . including such corrections , at the tev scale we obtain @xmath86 with @xmath87 .",
    "note that similar to eq.([eq : soft - at - mirage-1 ] ) , eq.([eq : soft - at - mirage-2 ] ) also includes corrections of @xmath88 due to the violation of the mirage unification by @xmath81 .",
    "that is , we obtain @xmath89 up to @xmath90 at the tev scale .",
    "similarly , at the tev scale we can obtain , @xmath91 up to @xmath92 .",
    "because of such ambiguity , we use @xmath84 as a free parameter , which must be small compared with @xmath35 . in addition , we determine the values of @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 at the electroweak scale from the stationary conditions , ( [ eq:1 ] ) , where we use the experimental value @xmath96 gev and @xmath97 as a free parameter .    through the above procedure , the parameters , @xmath7 , @xmath98 and @xmath1 , at the electroweak scale are expressed by @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 as follows , @xmath102 where , @xmath103 for @xmath104 , these parameters are approximated as ,    @xmath105    [ eq : app ]    when @xmath106 , the values of @xmath1 , @xmath70 and @xmath107 are smaller than @xmath35 by the factor @xmath97 because @xmath108 .",
    "thus , the values of @xmath1 and @xmath70 could be of @xmath72 gev while the other masses of the superpartners are of @xmath109 tev . then , the fine - tuning problem can be ameliorated .",
    "furthermore , one can see that the first and the second terms in the last equation cancel each other for our choice of @xmath34 .",
    "the next leading contributions are of @xmath110 or @xmath111 .",
    "thus , @xmath112 is almost determined by @xmath7 alone and insensitive to the value of @xmath1 .",
    "this means that actually @xmath113 is enough to obtain the fine - tuning of @xmath114% for @xmath115 tev . in this case",
    ", @xmath1 can be as heavy as @xmath116 gev without deteriorating the fine - tuning .",
    "the origin of this cancellation is easily understood by examining the doublet mass matrix , @xmath117 where @xmath118 the modulus mediated contribution @xmath35 cancels in the determinant of the mass matrix , @xmath119 .",
    "the heavy mode has mass of @xmath120 , then the mass of the light mode is suppressed as @xmath121 and a flat direction appears along @xmath122 .",
    "this mechanism was previously observed in @xcite in the context of the mssm . in the nmssm ,",
    "the relation @xmath123 is well controlled up to the leading contribution of the modulus mediation , in contrast to the @xmath124-term ( in place of @xmath101 ) in the mssm , which is a remnant of the fine - tuned cancellation between the terms of @xmath125 and subject to uncontrolled corrections .    in the following section ,",
    "we show numerically the spectrum of our model .      here",

    "when @xmath80 and/or @xmath81 are large at the electroweak scale , they blow up below the gut scale .",

    "the fine - tuning of the parameters for the electroweak symmetry breaking is of @xmath148 , even though most of the superpartners have heavy masses of @xmath120 .",
    "a large value of @xmath149 gev potentially degrades the fine - tuning , however the cancellation renders @xmath1 irrelevant to @xmath5 at the leading order of the expansion by @xmath150 .",
    "the value of @xmath107 is roughly estimated as @xmath151 in eq .",

    "the second term comes from the new quartic higgs couplings in the nmssm , and the third term comes from the mixing of the doublet scalars with the singlet .",
    "the third term is always negative because the mixing reduces the lightest eigenvalue of the mass matrix .",
    "although the above approximation does not apply in the figure , the behavior of the higgs mass can be understood in terms of the mixing .",

    ", it is found that we can realize @xmath213 gev , while other masses are heavy such as @xmath39 tev .",
    "then , the fine - tuning problem is ameliorated .",
    "the cancellation between the effective @xmath1-term and the down - type higgs soft mass reduces the sensitivity of @xmath1 to @xmath5 and @xmath2 gev is possible without significantly deteriorating the fine - tuning .",
    "the mixing between the light doublet and the singlet is suppressed by @xmath214 . for small @xmath99 the lightest cp - even higgs",
    "is mainly the doublet and its mass reaches @xmath161 gev without suppression by the mixing .",
    "when we increase @xmath35 , the higgs mass @xmath159 slowly increases , and also the value of @xmath71 increases .",
    "however , the required fine - tuning is still mild e.g. for @xmath215 gev .",
    "the coupling between the lightest cp - even higgs boson and the @xmath4 boson is almost the same as one in the standard model for small @xmath99 , however , can decrease to @xmath216 % for moderate @xmath99 where the lightest cp - even higgs is mainly singlet .",
    "if the lightest cp - even higgs escapes the lepii bound , the second lightest cp - even higgs boson could be the boson observed in lhc .",
    "the mass of the second lightest cp - even higgs boson depends on @xmath81 and @xmath80 , and it can be light in the parameter region favored in our scenario .",
    "the heaviest cp - even higgs mass as well as the heaviest cp - odd and charged ones is of @xmath120 .",
    "the lightest cp - odd higgs can also be light .",
    "thus , the higgs sector has a rich structure .    in our scenario ,",
    "the higgsino is light compared with three gauginos . in addition , the singlino is also light .",
    "both masses of the higgsino and the singlino are of the same order .",
    "then , the lightest superparticle is a linear combination between the higgsino and singlino . such a neutralino sector and higgs sector would lead to several phenomenologically interesting aspects .    while this work was being completed , we received ref .",
