    "among all techniques for determining galaxy masses , strong gravitational lensing yields the most precise and accurate measurements , with errors of only a few per cent in favourable cases ( treu 2010 ; courteau et al .",
    "2014 ) . with no dependence on the dynamical or thermal state of tracer material , lensing is free from many of the degeneracies afflicting other mass probes .",
    "being sensitive to all gravitating matter , lensing provides some of the strongest direct evidence for dark matter halos around elliptical galaxies .",
    "if the contributions of dark and baryonic mass can be distinguished , e.g. through their different spatial distribution , then lensing can be used to measure the stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath10 .",
    "such measurements can provide stringent constraints on stellar population models , and especially on the initial mass function ( imf ) , since faint low - mass stars ( and/or dark remnants of high - mass stars ) add substantially to the total mass .    analysing the lensing properties and stellar velocity dispersions ( @xmath2 ) of a sample of 56 strong - lens systems from the slacs survey ,",
    "treu et al . (",
    "2010 ) found that the imf and the dark - matter halo profile could not _ both _ be universal .",
    "holding the halo profile fixed , they derived a trend in `` excess '' stellar mass , which they attributed to a non - universal imf .",
    "galaxies with lower velocity dispersion were consistent with milky - way - like ( e.g. kroupa 2001 or chabrier 2003 ) imfs , while for their most massive galaxies , with @xmath2@xmath9300 , the slacs modelling requires stellar mass - to - light ratios twice that expected for a mw - like imf , i.e. @xmath4=@xmath11@xmath122 ( where @xmath13 is the expected stellar mass to light ratio for a kroupa imf , given observational constraints on the star - formation history ) .",
    "auger et al .",

    "( 2004 ) . with this modification however ,",
    "the requirement for a _ trend _ in @xmath4 with galaxy mass is not significant , and even the most massive lenses have @xmath4@xmath121.4 , intermediate between kroupa ( 2001 ) ( @xmath4=1 ) and a salpeter imf with a slope of @xmath14=2.35 over the wide mass range 0.1100m@xmath15 .",

    "the difference with respect to the treu et al .",
    "result highlights the challenge in separating baryonic from dark - matter contributions to the total lensing mass .",
    "concurrently with the slacs analysis , two other largely independent methods also found evidence to favour heavy imfs in giant ellipticals .",
    "fitting dynamical models to integral - field stellar kinematics from the sauron survey , cappellari et al .",
    "( 2006 ) showed that excess mass was required in the most massive ellipticals , which could be attributed either to an increasing dark matter fraction or to a systematic trend in the imf . with more detailed modelling of the larger atlas3d survey dataset , cappellari et al .",
    "( 2012 , 2013 ) were able to reject the dark - matter solution , for a range of possible halo prescriptions ( see also thomas et al .",
    "they concluded that the imf mass normalisation indeed increases with velocity dispersion , though the derived trend has a shallower slope than that of treu et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . at 300",
    "the ( extrapolated ) atlas3d trend implies an average @xmath4=1.6 , with an estimated intrinsic scatter of 20per cent .",
    "the two trends are not necessarily inconsistent however , since the atlas3d sample probes smaller velocity dispersions than the slacs lenses ; posacki et al .",
    "( 2015 ) derived a quadratic @xmath4-vs-@xmath2 relation , with the slope steepening at high @xmath2 , which adequately describes both samples .",
    "an alternative approach to dynamical modelling using single - fibre spectra for large galaxy samples similarly favours an imf trend reaching @xmath4@xmath92 at @xmath2@xmath9300  ( e.g. dutton et al . 2013",

    "2014 ) .",
    "in parallel with these works , van dokkum & conroy ( 2010 ) studied gravity - sensitive spectral features in giant ellipticals , and found evidence for an excess population of cool dwarf stars , corresponding to a bottom - heavy imf .",
    "the spectroscopic method is quite distinct from lensing or dynamics , in that the stellar content is probed directly , rather than through any constraint on the total mass , and is hence independent of uncertainties due to dark matter .",
    "further studies with this approach ( spiniello et al . 2012 ; conroy & van dokkum 2012b ; smith , lucey & carter 2012 ; ferreras et al . 2013",
    "; la barbera et al . 2013 ; spiniello et al .",
    "2014 ) confirmed a trend of increasing dwarf - star content as a function of galaxy `` mass '' ( velocity dispersion or correlated quantities , e.g. element abundances ) .",

    "recent improvements of the models and enlargements to the sample , however , yield a wider galaxy - to - galaxy range in @xmath4 at high mass , and hence a smaller average @xmath4 , but a milky - way - like imf remains disfavoured ( conroy & van dokkum , in preparation ) .",
    "this paper describes an effort to derive robust constraints on @xmath4 in high velocity dispersion galaxies , by finding and analysing strong - lensing galaxies at much lower redshift than those in existing samples .",
    "the accurately determined quantity in a strong - lens system is usually the total projected mass within the einstein aperture , defined by a threshold in enclosed surface density ( which depends on the angular diameter distances of the lens and source ) . for a given source redshift ,",
    "the einstein radius @xmath16 ( in angular units ) varies only slowly with lens redshift .",
    "hence , while distant lens galaxies ( e.g. the `` cosmic horseshoe '' studied by spiniello et al .",
    "2011 ) have @xmath16 comparable to , or larger than , the half - light radius ( @xmath17 ) of the stellar component , in nearby lenses the mass can be determined at a small fraction of @xmath17 . since stars are more centrally concentrated than dark matter , nearby lenses are optimal for measuring the _ stellar _ mass - to - light ratio and hence for constraining the imf in massive galaxies .",
    "a further motivation for studying such systems is that the lens galaxies can be characterised in great detail , with high signal - to - noise spectroscopy , to determine the probable star - formation history , which in turn tightens the limits on @xmath4 .",
    "only one low - redshift ( here defined as @xmath18 ) massive elliptical strong - lens galaxy has been reported before now=0.04 is a spiral galaxy .",
    "the possible extended arc around in ngc5532 ( hardcastle et al . 2005 ) has not yet been confirmed with deeper imaging or spectroscopy .",

    "the two principal obstacles to assembling a sample of low - redshift strong - lensing massive ellipticals are the intrinsic rarity of the lens population and the low contrast between lens and source in `` typical '' systems .",
    "any search restricted to very bright arcs will have a low yield of lenses per candidate , and hence must probe a very large survey volume ( e.g. @xmath67gpc@xmath24 within @xmath0@xmath200.3 for slacs ) . to find lenses in useful numbers within a `` local '' volume ( say 0.07gpc@xmath24 within @xmath0@xmath200.06 ) , a search must be able to detect systems in which the lensed source is very faint , a task made more difficult by superposition on a bright foreground galaxy .",
    "traditional methods struggle to identify lenses in this regime .",

    "our methods most clearly depart from the approach taken by t10 in the treatment of dark matter contributions .",
    "t10 fit a spherical two - component ( dark plus stellar ) mass model to the measured velocity dispersion and einstein radius .",
    "the velocity dispersion depends mainly on the _ enclosed _ mass at small radius , while @xmath16 constrains the _ projected _ mass at larger radius .",
    "these observables are employed together to disentangle the contributions of the two components of the mass model . in the t10 analysis ,",
    "the dark matter is assumed to follow the navarro et al .",
    "( 1995 ) density profile , i.e. with @xmath25@xmath6@xmath26 in the region sampled by the data .",
    "posacki et al .",
    "( 2015 ) show that essentially identical results are obtained using more general axisymmetric models constrained by the observed light distribution , velocity dispersion and einstein - aperture projected mass .    in snells",
    "we have instead chosen to assume a dark matter contribution informed by results from the eagle hydrodynamical simulation . to test whether this difference in method accounts for the divergent results obtained , we have used the @xmath16 tabulated by auger et al .",
    "( 2009 ) to derived the projected dark - matter mass predicted for the slacs lenses by our method .",
    "for the twelve galaxies with the highest velocity dispersions , we find that the dark - matter masses predicted from eagle are larger , by a median factor of 2.6 than those recovered by t10 from their two - component mass models .",
    "using the eagle approach instead would increase the median dark - matter fraction ( within @xmath16 ) in the slacs galaxies from 14per cent to 33per cent , and reduce the median imf mass factor from 2.0 to 1.6 , for these high-@xmath2 galaxies .",
    "( across the whole slacs sample , the median @xmath4 is reduced from 1.6 to 1.3 with the imposition of eagle dark - matter content . )",
    "this reduction in @xmath4 is similar to what was obtained by auger et al .",
    "( 2010 ) from a re - analysis of the slacs data , allowing explicitly for halo contraction effects .",
    "in particular , when modelling contraction following the gnedin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) prescription , auger et al .",
    "recover a shallower trend with galaxy mass , reaching a maximum of @xmath4@xmath121.4 .",
    "a second methodological difference between the studies is in the method for assigning the reference mass - to - light ratio , @xmath13 : t10 use estimates from fits to the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) based on broad - band optical and ( sometimes ) ir data , described by auger et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . in fitting the seds , however , they impose an informative prior on the star - formation histories restricting the onset of star - formation to early epochs ( 1@xmath1@xmath0@xmath15 , uniform in time ) and favouring short star - formation timescales ( @xmath27@xmath201gyr ) . in practice",
    "these priors force the lens galaxies to have old stellar populations , and hence the slacs @xmath13 is within @xmath610per cent of what would be imposed by our default assumption for snells .",
    "we have not found a satisfying explanation for the factor - of - two disagreement between the lensing - based estimates of @xmath4 from snells and from slacs for similarly - high-@xmath2 ellipticals .",
    "halo contraction could account for part of the difference , but analyses of slacs and other datases appear to favour uncontracted nfw halos ( e.g. dutton et al . 2013 ; dutton & treu 2014 , but see grillo 2012 ; sonnenfeld et al .",
    "while it is possible that our dark - matter corrections from eagle could have been overestimated , we note again that even assuming no dark matter at all , the mean @xmath4 from snells is still inconsistent with the average of @xmath62 derived for slacs at @xmath2@xmath3300 .",
    "as emphasised by smith ( 2014 ) , there are important differences between the a3d and cvd12b results for @xmath4 , both at the level of individual galaxies , and in terms of trends with respect to @xmath2 and [ mg / fe ] .",
    "in particular , in cvd12b , @xmath4 is more strongly correlated than with @xmath2 , while the reverse holds for a3d . for galaxy properties similar to those of the snells lenses ,",
    "cvd12b find larger values of @xmath4 than a3d , with an average of @xmath62 , and hence the apparent discrepancy between cvd12b and snells is @xmath64@xmath2 ( assuming same intrinsic scatter as for a3d ) .",
    "since publication of cvd12b , conroy & van dokkum ( in preparation ) have expanded their observational sample , and made numerous improvements to the spectral fitting method .",
    "these updates have led to somewhat smaller derived @xmath4 factors , on average , for the most massive galaxies .",
    "more detailed comparisons should await publication of the revised spectroscopic constraints .      aside from velocity dispersion and [ mg / fe ] ,",
    "another property of galaxies which has been proposed as being related to imf variation is `` compactness '' .",
    "since compact massive galaxies are abundant at high redshifts but rare in the local universe ( e.g. trujillo et al .",
    "2006 ) , it has been argued that low - redshift compact galaxies are surviving `` pristine '' relics of the early violent starburst epoch , where non - standard imfs may have been imposed ( lsker et al .",
    "2013 ; chabrier , hennebelle & charlot 2014 ) . in sl13 , we argued that a dependence on compactness might account for the difference between the `` lightweight '' imf in snl-0 and the heavy imf found by lsker et al . in the @xmath0=0.1 compact galaxy `` b19 '' .",
    "the addition of the two new snells lenses does not support this speculation . figure  [ fig : sixdffp ] shows projections of the 6df fundamental plane from campbell et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , and the location of the three snells lenses for comparison .",
    "although the sample size remains small , the lenses acceptably reproduce the distribution of size and luminosity for defined by the whole @xmath2@xmath3300  galaxy population .",
    "snl-0 and snl-2 are somewhat larger and more luminous than average , while snl-1 lies among the most compact of the high-@xmath2 galaxies .",
    "the properties of snl-1 , where lensing requires @xmath4@xmath121.2 are in fact very similar to those of b19 , where lsker et al .",
    "find @xmath4=2.2@xmath50.6 from dynamics ( unless b19 harbours an extremely massive central black hole ) .    in summary",
    ", we do not find support from snells for a strong correlation of @xmath4 with compactness among the @xmath2@xmath3300population .",
    "clearly this conclusion is heavily dependent on the results for snl-1 , however , and the current small sample can not rule out a correlation having large intrinsic scatter .",
    "we have presented first results from the snells survey for nearby strong - lensing ellipticals , demonstrating the success of our infra - red ifu search method with the discovery of two new @xmath0@xmath200.05 lenses , as well as recovering the only previously - known case , eso325g004 .",
    "the survey yield , i.e. identified lenses per new observed candidate , is broadly compatible with the @xmath610per cent rate estimated from the h@xmath4 luminosity function of sobral et al .",
    "( 2013 ) ( but note that one of the new sources , like that in eso325g004 , is an [ oiii ] emitter , and hence not included in our calculations ) .",
    "compared to distant lens samples , snells selects systems in which the einstein radius is a smaller fraction of the stellar effective radius , so that the lensing mass is more reliably dominated by the stellar component .",
    "our lens galaxies have high velocity dispersions ( @xmath2@xmath3300 ) and @xmath4-enhanced abundances ( [ mg / fe]@xmath90.3 ) , and hence are characteristic of the systems where previous works have inferred heavy imfs though dynamical ( cappellari et al . 2013 ) , lensing ( treu et al .",
    "2010 ) or spectroscopic ( conroy & van dokkum 2012b ) analyses .",
    "notwithstanding these properties , the snells galaxies have lensing - derived stellar mass - to - light ratios that are individually or collectively compatible with a milky - way - like kroupa ( 2001 ) imf .",
    "a heavier - than - salpeter imf ( without intrinsic scatter ) is disfavoured ( 3.5@xmath2 significance ) if we assume the stellar populations to be old ( @xmath7=1.10@xmath50.08@xmath50.10 ) , but can not be excluded if we fit the ages from the currently - available spectra ( @xmath7=1.23@xmath50.15@xmath50.10 ) .",
    "very heavy imfs with @xmath4@xmath32 are firmly rejected using either approach .",
    "the result for eso325g004 ( snl-0 ) is consistent with our previous estimates ( smith & lucey 2013 ) , despite several changes in data and methods .",
    "the mean imf result obtained from snells is mildly inconsistent ( at the 23@xmath2 level ) with the imf - versus-@xmath2 trend reported by cappellari et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , after accounting for intrinsic scatter and our field - of - view selection bias .",
    "there is a larger discrepancy with respect to the treu et al .",
    "( 2010 ) analysis of the slacs lens sample , part of which can be attributed to the different treatment of projected dark - matter contributions .",
    "the snells results are also apparently in conflict with the bottom - heavy imfs inferred from spectroscopic fitting by conroy & van dokkum ( 2012b ) at similarly high @xmath2 and mg / fe .    the largest source of uncertainty in each _ individual _ measurement of @xmath4 is in the treatment of @xmath13 , while the extent to which we can infer the _ distribution _ of @xmath4 in the population of giant early - type galaxies is limited by the small sample size . in future work with snells",
    ", we plan to observe more lens candidates , with the goal of doubling the sample of low - redshift lensing systems available for analysis .",
    "we are also pursuing homogeneous high - signal - to - noise optical / ir spectroscopy of the lens galaxies .",
    "the optical spectra will yield more reliable estimates for the stellar age and metallicity of the lenses , and hence @xmath13 , obviating the need to assume purely old stellar populations .",
    "the red and ir spectra will cover a range of imf sensitive features ( including the nai 8200-  doublet and feh wing  ford band ) providing a stringent test of spectroscopic models in cases where the low - mass stellar content is constrained by the lensing",
    "eventually , we will to use these systems to compare multiple methods of imf estimation ( lensing , dynamical , spectroscopic ) for a common sample of nearby galaxies , where high quality data can be readily obtained .    at present",
    ", sinfoni is the only ifu operating with sufficiently wide contiguous field - of - view to perform a study of this kind efficiently in the ir .",
    "however , the success of our search strategy suggests it should be worthwhile to search for lensed background sources in large optical ifu datasets , e.g. from the sami ( allen et al .",
    "2015 ) and manga ( bundy et al .",
    "2015 ) surveys .",
