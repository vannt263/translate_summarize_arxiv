    "images of starburst galaxies obtained with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ have resolved the sites of active star formation into numerous compact star clusters ( see e.g. , schweizer 1999 ; whitmore 2000 and references therein ) . these so - called `` super star clusters '' ( sscs ) comprise approximately 20% of the total observed ultraviolet flux , and therefore represent a major mode of star formation in starburst galaxies ( meurer et al .",
    "the radii of these sscs are typically a few pc and masses , estimated from both theoretical mass - to - light ratios and from direct measurements of velocity dispersions , are in the range @xmath19 .",
    "the oldest of these sscs have ages significantly greater than their dynamical timescales and hence must be bound .",
    "the masses , sizes , stellar densities , and ages of sscs suggest that the most massive examples may be the progenitors of globular clusters .",
    "sscs may also be intimately related to nuclear stellar clusters recently found in the centers of exponential bulges in spiral galaxies ( carollo , stiavelli , & mack 1998 ; carollo 1999 ; bker , van der marel , & vacca 1999 ; bker et al .",
    "although the processes involved and the conditions required for massive star cluster formation are not completely understood , it seems clear that extreme environments are necessary . in the local universe",
    "vigorous star formation activity , for which sscs are the signposts , often appears to be associated with cataclysmic events , such as galaxy mergers and interactions .    with ages",
    "@xmath20 few myr , the young blue sscs discovered with hst ( whitmore 2000 ) have already emerged from their birth clouds .",
    "even earlier stages of cluster evolution must be hidden from optical and ultraviolet ( uv ) observations by large amounts of molecular clouds and dust from which the clusters are formed .",
    "hence , studies of the early phases of cluster evolution require observations at longer wavelengths which are relatively immune to the effects of dust scattering and absorption by the natal material .",
    "recent radio observations of the starburst galaxies he 2 - 10 by kobulnicky & johnson ( 1999 , hereafter kj99 ) , and ngc 5253 by turner and collaborators ( e.g. , turner , beck , & ho 2000 ; gorjian , turner , & beck 2001 ) suggest that examples of this young , embedded phase of cluster evolution may now have been identified .",
    "the radio maps of these starbursts reveal several compact thermal continuum sources that are optically thick at @xmath21 cm and longer wavelengths .",
    "while the radio spectra ( either flat or rising with frequency ) clearly indicate the emission from these sources is thermal in origin , the small sizes ( @xmath22 few pc ) , large inferred densities ( @xmath23 @xmath24 ) and enormous emission measures ( @xmath25 @xmath26 pc ) suggest however that these are not simply `` normal '' h ii regions .",
    "although h ii regions with similar densities , emission measures , and so - called `` inverted spectra '' ( @xmath27 with @xmath28 ) exist in the galaxy , and are known as ultracompact h regions ( uchs ; for a review see churchwell 1990 , 1999 ) , galactic uchs exist on vastly smaller mass scales : typical galactic uchs are excited by a single ( or only a few ) o - type star(s ) ( e.g. , churchwell , wolfire , & wood 1990 ) .",
    "the compact radio sources found in he 2 - 10 and ngc 5253 , on the other hand , have inferred masses of @xmath29 , ionizing luminosities @xmath30 , and contain the equivalent of @xmath31 o - type stars .",
    "the properties of these compact sources are clearly similar to those of the sscs seen in the optical and uv images . because of the similarity of their radio spectra to those of uchs , kj99 dubbed these objects `` ultradense h regions '' , or udhs .    the existence of such dense thermal emission regions in starburst galaxies had been suggested prior to the recent results on he 2 - 10 and ngc 5253 .",
    "puxley et al .",
    "( 1991 ) inferred the presence of compact , high density clusters in ngc 2146 based on h53@xmath32 observations .",
    "this result was confirmed by tarchi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who found six udhs in 1.6 and 5 ghz maps of this galaxy .",
    "zhao et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , using h92@xmath32 observations , found similarly dense regions in ngc 3628 and ic 694 .",
    "ulvestad & antonucci ( 1997 ) reported a number of such flat - spectrum sources in multi - wavelength radio maps of ngc 253 .",
    "the unusual properties of the udh in ngc 5253 were suggested by the work of beck et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and turner , ho , & beck ( 1998 ) .",
    "in addition , the vla survey of so - called wolf - rayet galaxies by beck , turner , & kovo ( 2000 ) indicates that udhs are quite common in starbursts .",
    "the significance of the recent results on he 2 - 10 and ngc 5253 lies not simply in the detection of the udh regions , but also in the morphologies of the radio maps relative to high spatial resolution optical images obtained with _ hst_.",
    "_ none _ of the radio `` knots '' detected in he 2 - 10 and ngc 5253 is associated with the sscs readily seen in the _ hst _ ultraviolet and optical images .",
    "it is this detailed positional comparison , impossible before the launch of _ hst _ , that is so striking and that lends support to the suggestion by kj99 that these radio sources are in fact heavily dust - enshrouded stellar clusters , the youngest phases of sscs still buried deep within their birth clouds .",
    "if these udhs are indeed young sscs hidden at ultraviolet and optical wavelengths as the result of absorption by surrounding dust , the bulk of their substantial bolometric luminosities should be radiated in the mid- to far - ir regimes as a result of the reprocessing of the cluster ultraviolet flux by the dust . with this in mind , we have carried out a set of near - infrared and thermal infrared imaging observations in an attempt to detect the udhs directly from their dust emission . in this paper",
    "we present the detection of thermal - infrared emission in the @xmath2-band from the udhs discovered by kj99 in he  2 - 10 .",
    "the observations are described in  2 .",
    "a discussion of the relative morphologies , an analysis of the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the radio knots , and constraints on the properties of the embedded stellar clusters are presented in  3 .",
    "we compare the properties of the udhs seen in he 2 - 10 with those of galactic uchs and discuss the implications our results have on the infrared - radio correlation and the @xmath33 correlation for starburst galaxies in  4 .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in  5 .",
    "@xmath2-band ( @xmath34 m ) observations of he 2 - 10 were made using the mid - infrared imager oscir on the gemini north telescope during the scheduled oscir mini - queue in february 2001 .",
    "oscir contains a @xmath35 si : as bib detector sensitive between 8 and 25 @xmath3 m . at gemini north , the field of view of oscir is @xmath36 and the pixel scale is @xmath37 pix@xmath38 .",
    "conditions were photometric during the observations and the seeing , as measured by the fwhm of standard stars , was in the range of @xmath39 .",
    "however , due to high winds , unfortunately only a total of ten minutes of ` on source ' integration time were possible .",
    "two sets of 5 minute observations ( with small offsets in pointing ) were made of he  2 - 10 at an airmass of @xmath40 . throughout the observations ,",
    "standard chopping and nodding techniques were employed in order to subtract the thermal sky background .",
    "the images were reduced using the oreduce task in the gemini / oscir package available in the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) .",
    "the two sets of images of he 2 - 10 were reduced separately and then shifted ( to account for the pointing offsets ) and combined . the final @xmath2-band image , corresponding to @xmath41 , is shown in figure  [ nimage ] , which reveals several marginally - resolved , closely - spaced emission regions .",
    "photometry of these regions was performed by constructing a model of the source , consisting of tilted , elliptical gaussians atop a constant background , and fitting it to the image using a least - squares routine .",
    "in addition to providing estimates of the total fluxes and sizes of the extended emission regions , and a goodness - of - fit value , this method also ensures consistency between the @xmath2-band fluxes and the radio fluxes , which were derived in a similar fashion .",
    "the data were calibrated using observations of the standard stars @xmath32  crb , @xmath42  leo , and @xmath43  pix .",
    "we adopted the @xmath2-band magnitudes given by tokunaga ( 1984 ) for @xmath32  crb and @xmath42  leo .",
    "the @xmath2-band magnitude of @xmath43  pix was calculated using the absolutely calibrated spectrum given by cohen et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and the oscir filter transmission curve .",
    "we adopted the median @xmath2-band extinction coefficient for mauna kea given by krisciunas et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and solved for the photometric zero point .",
    "the zero point and the extinction coefficient were then applied to the instrumental fluxes computed for the various emission regions in he 2 - 10 .",
    "flux densites in mjy were computed using the conversion given on the oscir web page ( 0 mag @xmath44 jy ) .",
    "the absolute uncertainties in the source fluxes are @xmath45  % and are dominated by the uncertainties in the photometric calibration derived from the standard stars .      as part of a larger project to image starburst galaxies in the near - infrared ,",
    "he 2 - 10 was observed in the @xmath0 , @xmath4 , and @xmath1 bands using the university of hawaii 2.2 m telescope with the quick infrared camera ( quirc , hodapp et al .",
    "1996 ) and the uh tip / tilt system ( jim et al .",
    "2000 ) on 02 january 1996 .",
    "quirc contains a @xmath46 hawaii array produced by rockwell and is sensitive between 1 and 2.5@xmath3 m . at the @xmath47 focus of the 2.2 m telescope ,",
    "the pixel scale is @xmath48 pix@xmath38 and the field of view is approximately @xmath49 . during the observations , conditions were photometric and the seeing ,",
    "as measured from standard stars , was about @xmath50 at @xmath1 .",
    "standard procedures were used for observing an extended source in the near - infrared ( dithering and nodding to sky ) .",
    "a set of 7 on - source images , each 180 s in @xmath0 and @xmath4 and 90 s in @xmath1 , were acquired .",
    "a set of equal length sky exposures were interleaved between the source frames .",
    "the images were reduced in iraf using a suite of specially designed routines . after subtracting the sky and flat - fielding ,",
    "the images were aligned and combined using a median routine . the @xmath1 image of the center of he 2 - 10 , with the central position , size , and orientation corresponding to the @xmath2-band image , is presented in figure  [ kimage ] ; the full @xmath0 band image of he 2 - 10 was presented by vacca ( 1997 ) .",
    "flux calibration was determined from near - infrared photometric standard stars ( casali & hawarden 1992 ) observed during the night .",
    "a detailed discussion and analysis of the near - infrared images will be presented elsewhere ( vacca , in preparation ) .",
    "figures [ nimage ] and [ kimage ] show the @xmath2 and @xmath1 images of he 2 - 10 , respectively ; the orientations and fields of view of these images are the same . for an assumed distance to he 2 - 10 of 9 mpc ( vacca & conti 1992 )",
    ", @xmath51 corresponds to about 44 pc ; the full image shown in figure  [ nimage ] covers approximately 410 pc @xmath52 410 pc . despite the lower resolution of the ground - based observations , the @xmath1 image appears very similar to the hst uv and optical images presented by conti & vacca ( 1994 ) and johnson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , in that it reveals a bright arc of emission , and a luminous point source at the top of the arc corresponding to the brightest uv / optical starburst knot , against a diffuse background . a detailed comparison between the near - ir images and the hst images will be presented elsewhere ( vacca , in prep . ) .",
    "the @xmath2-band image , however , which reveals three bright sources atop a much weaker background , is striking for its _ dissimilarity _ to either the optical or near - infrared images of this galaxy . to demonstrate this , in figure [ noptical ] we show the contours of the optical v - band image from hst obtained by johnson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) on top of the @xmath2-band image .",
    "even with the relative astrometric uncertainty in the hst image of @xmath53 , it is clear that _ none of the sscs seen in the hst uv and optical images , or the ground - based near - infrared images , is detected in the gemini @xmath2-band image . _",
    "the starburst clusters seen in the optical image are not associated with the bright mid - ir emission regions .",
    "in fact , it appears that the bright @xmath2-band regions serve to delimit the extent of the optical emission .",
    "the arc of uv / optical starburst knots is entirely located between the two brightest @xmath2-band sources directly to the east and west ; the brightest uv / optical ssc is located at the position of the weakest @xmath2-band emission between these two bright sources .",
    "this region of weak 10.8 @xmath3 m emission also shows very low h@xmath32 equivalent width , which johnson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) suggest is due to the strong winds from the starburst knots having blown away the ambient gas .",
    "the @xmath54 equivalent width map shows no other obvious correlation ( or anti - correlation ) with the @xmath2-band image ; weak @xmath54 emission is seen throughout the region where the brightest @xmath2-band source is located , for example .",
    "in contrast with the uv , optical , and near - infrared images , the radio maps of kj99 are extremely well - correlated with the @xmath2-band image , as shown in figure  [ nradio ] , which presents the 2 cm flux contours on top of the @xmath2-band image .",
    "the four sources detected in the @xmath2-band are clearly associated with four or five of the radio - bright udhs found by kj99 . _",
    "the morphology of the mid - ir emission is nearly identical to that of the thermal radio emission and is not correlated with the uv , optical , or near - ir morphology_. this result immediately suggests that most of the 10.8 @xmath55  flux is not due to ambient dust that has been heated ( primarily ) by the starburst knots seen in the uv / optical . as we will demonstrate below (  4.1 ) , heating of dust in the bright 10.8 @xmath55  regions and",
    "their surrounding vicinity by these optical sscs is negligible .",
    "rather , the 10.8 @xmath55  emission arises primarily from hot dust heated by the stars embedded within the udhs themselves .    in kj99",
    "the udhs are numbered 1 - 5 from west to east in he  2 - 10 . using this nomenclature ,",
    "we have detected the udhs 1 , 3 , 4 , and 5 at 10.8  @xmath3 m ; udh # 2 is likely to be blended with # 1 in the @xmath2-band image .",
    "all the knots have observed fwhm values larger than the seeing , and are therefore marginally resolved .",
    "knot 4 , in particular , is clearly extended in one direction , in agreement with the morphology seen in the radio maps .",
    "this may be due to the presence of several sources which are not separated at our resolution .",
    "the fluxes and @xmath2-band magnitudes of the four @xmath2-band knots are listed in table  [ flux.tab ] along with the effective radii derived from the elliptical gaussian fits used to determine the photometry .",
    "the effective radii were calculated from @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the semi - major axis and @xmath58 is the axial ratio determined from the fits .",
    "we corrected these values for broadening due to gaussian seeing .",
    "the total @xmath2-band flux found from our image is @xmath59 mjy .",
    "this value is in reasonable agreement with that given by telesco , dressel , & wolstencroft ( 1993 ) , who measured the integrated @xmath2-band flux of he  2 - 10 to be @xmath60  mjy .",
    "both of these values , however , are substantially smaller than those found by sauvage , thuan , & lagage ( 1997 ; 1.06 jy ) and cohen & barlow ( 1974 ; 1.6 jy).m observations of he 2 - 10 by beck , turner , & gorjian ( 2001 ) were brought to our attention .",
    "the morphology of he 2 - 10 at @xmath61 m appears to be very similar ( as expected ) to that seen in our @xmath62 m image .",
    "beck et al .  ( 2001 ) measure a total flux at @xmath61 m of 880 mjy , which represents at least 80% of the total 12 @xmath3 m flux measured by iras .",
    "this value is in reasonable agreement with our estimate of the total flux at @xmath62 m , given that the infrared spectrum of he 2 - 10 as measured by iras is steeply rising between 12 and 25 @xmath3 m ; our value is within the 20% uncertainty of theirs .",
    "however , their estimates of the fluxes for the individual knots seen in the images are about a factor of 2 larger than ours .",
    "this is presumably due to the fact that beck et al .",
    "( 2001 ) did not account for the background beneath the knots in their photometric measurements .",
    "nevertheless , the fractional contributions of the knots to the total @xmath61 m flux are identical to those found here .",
    "the physical sizes of the knots as estimated by beck et al .",
    "( 2001 ) are somewhat smaller than , although comparable to , those we have derived . ]",
    "sauvage et al .",
    "( 1997 ) dismissed the measurement of cohen & barlow ( 1974 ) as being in error since it is substantially larger than the 12 @xmath55  iras flux .",
    "the difference between our flux value and that of sauvage et al .",
    "( 1997 ) is more puzzling , however , as he 2 - 10 is a fairly compact source and all of the flux contours presented by sauvage et al .",
    "( 1997 ) are contained within the field of view of our image .",
    "in fact , their deconvolved image appears to be nearly identical to ours , and all of their measured flux is contained within the same regions we detect ( see their table 1 ) .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that sauvage et al .",
    "( 1997 ) could have detected significantly more flux from he 2 - 10 ( in , for example , a faint diffuse extended component ) than we see .",
    "the discrepancy is probably due to three factors : ( 1 ) large differences in the @xmath2-band filter transmission profiles and central wavelengths ; ( 2 ) an attempt by sauvage et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to incorporate a color term in their photometric calibration ( we have not included a correction for the color differences between our standards and he 2 - 10 ) ; and ( 3 ) non - photometric conditions during the observations of sauvage et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . with regard to point ( 2 ) , we should point out that , while there probably is a potentially large color term in the photometric transformations between the standards and he 2 - 10 , the color term correction adopted by sauvage et al .",
    "( 1997 ) is almost certainly incorrect .",
    "sauvage et al .",
    "( 1997 ) extrapolated their observed 10.1  @xmath3 m to the @xmath2-band assuming a spectral energy distribution of @xmath63 ; however , as we show below , the spectral energy distribution of he 2 - 10 near @xmath64 m is actually decreasing rapidly with frequency ( see also zinnecker 1987 ) .",
    "additionally , if we fit a blackbody spectrum to the iras 12  @xmath3 m and 25  @xmath3 m flux points , and extrapolate to @xmath65 m , we predict a total @xmath2-band flux of 640 mjy , in good agreement with both our observed value and that of telesco et al .",
    "it should also be noted that sauvage et al .",
    "( 1997 ) assumed the thermal - ir emission is coincident with the optically visible starburst .",
    "as can be seen from figures  [ nradio ] and [ noptical ] , the dust emission coincides with the thermal radio morphology and is _ not _ associated with the optically visible sscs .",
    "the combined @xmath2-band flux of the four detected udhs indicates that @xmath66% of the @xmath65 m flux from the entire galaxy can be attributed to just these four objects .",
    "almost all of the remaining @xmath2-band flux is due to the background on which the udhs sit , and which has a morphology very similar to that of the udhs , but on a slightly more extended scale .",
    "very little flux arises from any diffuse component beyond the immediate location of the udhs .",
    "the surface brightness of the background beneath the udhs is approximately 10 mjy / sq arcsec .",
    "based on the relative morphologies of the hst images and the background detected in the @xmath2-band image , it would also appear that very little of this background flux is due to emission from dust directly surrounding and heated by the sscs seen in the uv and optical images .",
    "it is possible that some of the background flux arises from dust which is heated by radiation escaping from the udhs .",
    "if this is indeed the case , then nearly all of the observed @xmath2-band flux and , by extension nearly all of the observed flux in the 12 @xmath55  iras band , from he 2 - 10 would be attributable to udhs that are invisible in uv , optical , and near - infrared images . given the vigorous star formation throughout he 2 - 10 , as traced by the hst uv and optical images ( conti & vacca 1994 ; johnson et al .",
    "2000 ) , this result is in itself rather remarkable .",
    "the relative locations along the line of sight of the @xmath2-band knots and the optically bright starburst knots are not known ; the optical sscs could be located in front , behind , or at the same distance as the @xmath2-band sources .",
    "if the optical sscs are located behind the @xmath2-band knots , this would suggest that the observed optical morphology is completely determined and delineated by the foreground regions of low dust optical depth ( and hence weak or absent @xmath2-band emission ) .",
    "on the other hand , if the @xmath2-band knots and the optical sscs reside at the same relative distance , it is tempting to conclude that the @xmath2-band morphology may , to some extent , be a result of the sweeping action of the wind arising from the optically visible starburst .",
    "the @xmath2-band emission would then identify regions where dust has been swept up , the density has increased , and the resulting structures have collapsed and begun to form stars ; the areas of faint or absent @xmath2-band emission would indicate regions where the dust has been effectively cleared out by the starburst wind .",
    "we have constructed an sed for each of the four @xmath2-band knots by combining the measured @xmath2-band fluxes , the radio fluxes at 2 and 6 cm from kj99 , additional fluxes at 1.3 cm for three knots ( kindly provided by h.  kobulnicky , private communitcation ) , and estimated fluxes in the iras bands .",
    "the last were estimated as follows . as discussed above",
    ", there is a good correspondence between the total @xmath2-band flux observed from he 2 - 10 and that predicted at 10.8 @xmath67 m by fitting the short wavelength iras fluxes with a simple blackbody .",
    "hence , it appears that the knots seen in the @xmath2-band image can account for most of the @xmath68 m iras flux from he 2 - 10.m observations of he 2 - 10 by beck et al .",
    "see footnote 3 and the previous section . ]",
    "if we now assume that the @xmath2-band and radio images are representative of the spatial distribution of the emission regions detected in the iras bands , we can then infer the 12 , 25 , 60 , and 100",
    "@xmath3 m fluxes for each of the knots by multiplying the total iras fluxes for he 2 - 10 at these wavelengths by the fractional contributions of each knot to the total @xmath2-band flux .",
    "the resulting seds are shown in figure  [ seds ] and bear a remarkable resemblance to the seds for ultracompact h ii regions ( e.g. , wood & churchwell 1989 ) .    using the analysis of uch regions as a guide ( see e.g. , churchwell et al .  1990 ) , we have constructed simplified physical models of udh regions and attempted to match the observed seds of the knots with the model spectra .",
    "the models consist of a `` cocoon '' comprising two emission zones : an inner spherical region ( @xmath69 ) , which produces the thermal bremsstrahlung radio spectrum , surrounded by a spherical dust shell with @xmath70 , which is responsible for most of the far - infrared emision .",
    "the entire cocoon surrounds a stellar cluster which provides the photons necessary to ionize the inner region and heat the dust in the outer shell . for the free - free emission region we adopted the mean electron temperature found by kobulnicky et al.(1999 ) of @xmath71",
    "k , and assumed a constant electron density @xmath72 .    for simplicity , we assumed the dust consists of spherical silicate grains with an opacity proportional to @xmath73 and a radius of 0.1 @xmath55  .",
    "the absorption efficiency @xmath74 was normalized to a value of 0.01 at 40 @xmath3 , as given by draine & lee ( 1984 ) .",
    "the dust density was assumed to be constant with shell radius .",
    "the latter assumption has been shown to provide a good fit to the spectra of galactic uch regions ( churchwell et al .",
    "1990 ) the dust shell was assumed to be optically thin at all wavelengths .",
    "the far infrared data ( @xmath2-band and iras points ) clearly indicate that a single temperature blackbody is not a good representation of the sed .",
    "therefore , the dust temperature within the shell was allowed to vary with radius between values specified at the inner and outer edges of the shell , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "we adopted the specific functional form @xmath77 , where @xmath78 was determined from the fit to the data .",
    "this form was adopted primarily because it is fairly general and can reproduce the qualitative characteristics of the temperature profile found by churchwell et al .",
    "( 1990 ) in their analysis of the uch g5.89 - 0.39 .",
    "we made no attempt to determine the temperature self - consistently , however , and therefore these models are not completely realistic ; nevertheless , they are useful for obtaining rough estimates of the physical parameters of the knots .",
    "the model was fit to the seds of each of the knots using a least - squares procedure .",
    "the relevant parameters resulting from this procedure are given in table  [ pars ] .",
    "the radii @xmath79 and the electron densities @xmath72 we find are similar to those derived by kj99 ; the large electron densities are required to produce the turnover observed in the seds at the lowest frequencies . because of the manner in which the fluxes in the iras bands were estimated , the derived dust shell parameters are all very similar for the four knots .",
    "figure  [ sedmodel ] shows the resulting best fit to the spectrum of knot 4 . the temperature profile as a function of shell radius for knot 4",
    "is shown in figure  [ templot ] .",
    "as this figure shows , the dust temperature varies between @xmath80k at the inner edge and @xmath81k at the outer edge , falling off quickly with radius ; @xmath78 was found to be @xmath82 , and hence the temperature drops from its maximum value to below @xmath83 k within a radius of 10 pc , or less than 0.1% of the total shell volume . throughout most of the shell",
    "the dust temperature is between @xmath84 k and @xmath85 k. the outer temperature @xmath81k is in good agreement with the value expected for the ambient interstellar medium .",
    "churchwell et al .",
    "( 1990 ) found similar results in their more complete models of uch regions . despite the large outer radius ,",
    "it is not in contradiction with the observed sizes , as the half - light radius estimated from the temperature distribution is only about a few pc .",
    "rather , the fact that the predicted half - light radii are so much smaller than the radii measured from the @xmath2-band image suggests that the completely optically thin assumption we adopted may not be valid for the shorter wavelengths ( 10.8 , 12 , and possibly 25 @xmath3 m ) .    the total far infrared luminosity between 10 @xmath55  and 1 cm for knot 4 is @xmath86 , with an uncertainty of about 20% . ( the uncertainties on the infrared luminosities of the other knots are about 25% . )",
    "this represents about @xmath87% of the total far infrared flux from he 2 - 10 .",
    "the total mass found for the dust shell , @xmath88 , is about @xmath89 , where we have assumed the standard dust - to - gas ratio of @xmath90 ( whittet 1992 ) .",

    "additionally , the total shell mass could well be larger than our estimate if the dust shell is actually optically thick at the shorter wavelengths .",

    "this relation is strictly a lower limit , as both absorption of ionizing photons by dust ( @xmath129 ) and the use of @xmath120 yield larger cluster masses for any given age .",

    "udhs this may not be valid .",
    "as an aside , we note that one of the outstanding problems in the study of uchii regions has been their relatively long lifetimes .",
    "early estimates yielded an expected lifetime of a typical uch of only @xmath130 yr , far too short to account for the number of uchs seen in the galaxy ( wood & churchwell 1989 ) .",
    "de pree , rodrguez , & goss ( 1995 ; see also garca - segura & franco 1996 ) , however , have suggested that the solution to this puzzle lies in the value of the ambient gas density in which an uch is formed .",
    "if the ambient density is on the order of @xmath131 @xmath24 , rather than @xmath132 @xmath24 , the estimated lifetime of an uch can be increased by a factor of 10 or more beyond the original value estimated by wood & churchwell ( 1989 ) . given the observational similarities between udhs and uchs , we might expect these objects to be formed in analogous physical environments .",
    "as figure  [ mtplot ] demonstrates , the age of the stellar cluster in knot 4 is constrained to be less than about @xmath133 yr , with the most probable value less than @xmath134 yr , and the mass must be larger than about @xmath135 . carrying out similar calculations for the other knots seen in the @xmath2-band image reveals that they all must have ages less than about @xmath13 yr and masses greater than about @xmath14 . using the lower limit of the mass of the stellar cluster and the estimated mass of the surrounding dust shell for knot 4",
    ", we find a star formation efficiency of about 17% for this knot .",
    "the uncertainties on this value are , of course , very large .",
    "if we now assume that the total stellar mass in knot 4 must be less than about @xmath136 [ where we have increased the estimated cocoon mass by a factor of 10 , to allow for the possibilities that the sed model may have underestimated the total dust mass and that the dust - to - gas ratio may be smaller in irregular blue starburst galaxies ( hunter et al .",
    "1986 ) , and have required the star formation efficiency to be @xmath137% ] , we find that the age of the cluster in knot 4 must lie within a narrow range between @xmath138 yr .",
    "decreasing the mass of the stellar cluster raises the lower age limit and narrows the range of possible ages ; decreasing the age increases the lower mass limit .",
    "the total dynamical mass of he 2 - 10 was estimated by kobulnicky et al .",
    "( 1995 ) to be of the order of @xmath139 .",
    "therefore , it seems somewhat unlikely that @xmath136 of material could be contained within a single cluster with an effective radius of only 20 pc .",
    "however , reducing the estimated mass to @xmath140 yields an even narrower range of ages , @xmath141 yr .",
    "clearly these udhs are among the youngest extragalactic stellar clusters yet found .",
    "it is interesting to compare the results of this analysis with those determined above from the spectral models . for a cluster age of about @xmath134 yr and a mass of @xmath142",

    "we can , in fact , use the size of the ionized region to place additional constraints on the mass and age of the cluster . as expected from the above comparison of the radii ,",
    "the resulting curve lies close to that obtained from the total ionization rate derived from the radio fluxes .",
    "alternatively , if the mass and age of the cluster are known the comparison between @xmath79 and the predicted stromgren radius allows us to place limits on the amount dust contained within the ionized region . for the age - mass pair used above",
    ", the fraction of ionizing photons absorbed by dust within the stromgren sphere , @xmath114 , must be close to zero .",
    "however , for younger and/or more massive clusters , @xmath114 rises rapidly : for an age of @xmath143 yr and a mass of @xmath144 , for example , @xmath145 .",
    "the lower mass limits found for the stellar clusters embedded in these udhs are far larger than the typical masses found for sscs in he 2 - 10 ( johnson et al .",
    "2000 ) , ngc 1714 ( johnson et al.1999 ) , and many other starburst galaxies ( see schweizer 1999 ; whitmore 2000 and references within ) .",
    "the mass of the cluster in knot 4 is about a factor of 10 larger than that estimated for the most luminous ssc in he 2 - 10 ( johnson et al.2000 ) ; for the other knots , the estimated masses are factors of several larger than that of the brightest optical ssc . in deriving our constraints on the stellar cluster ages and masses ,",
    "we have assumed that each udh contains a single embedded cluster , with an initial mass function extending down to @xmath146 .",
    "if the mass function extends down only to @xmath147 ( the typical value assumed for mass estimates of sscs ) , the stellar cluster masses would be reduced by a factor of 2.55 .",
    "furthermore , the extended morphology of knot 4 could be due to the superposition of several unresolved sources .",
    "large uch complexes in the galaxy , such as w49a for example , consist of a conglomeration of several embedded clusters ( de pree et al .  1997 ; smith et al .  2000 ) .",
    "whether a given udh consists of a single embedded stellar cluster , or a complex of several clusters , each surrounded by their own dust cocoons and residing within a lower density intercluster medium , is unknown at present . because our mass and age limits are derived from the total observed broadband fluxes of each udh , they represent the luminosity - weighted ( or mass - weighted ) characteristics for the sum of the embedded clusters , if several are contained within an udh .",
    "hence individual subclusters would have smaller masses and could have a range of ages compared to our estimates .",
    "nevertheless , the mass estimates we have derived under the assumption of a single stellar cluster are within the observed range ( albeit at the high end ) of the masses found for sscs ( e.g. , mengel et al .  2001 ) and nuclear stellar clusters ( bker , van der marel , & vacca 1999 ) .",
    "recent work by johnson et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggests there is a continuum of sizes and masses of embedded extragalactic clusters , from those with only a few o7v * stars , lyman continuum photons s@xmath38 ( vacca 1994 ) . ] to moderate sized clusters of a few hundred o7v * ( which are observationally nearly identical to uch complexes in the galaxy such as w49a ) , up to these giant udhs , which may be proto - globular clusters .",
    "the question of whether subclusters are present within udhs could be settled by higher spatial resolution radio and infrared observations or possibly by interferometric observations in the @xmath2-band , for example with the midi instrument on the vlti ( leinert et al .",
    "2000 ; lopez et al .",
    "in figure  [ seds ] we plot the estimated seds for knots 1 + 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 seen in the @xmath2-band and radio images .",
    "comparison with the seds of galactic uch regions ( e.g. , wood & churchwell 1989 ) reveals a striking similarity and reinforces the suggestion of kj99 that the knots in he 2 - 10 are in fact the extragalactic analogues of uchs , albeit vastly scaled up in size .",
    "indeed , the inner dust temperature of 189 k found from our analysis of the seds of the knots in he 2 - 10 ( table 3 ) is remarkably close to that predicted by the simple relation between radius and temperature given by wilner , welch , & forster ( 1995 ) for galactic uchs , @xmath148 even though the lumosity is well beyond the range for which the relation was derived ( see e.g. , wolfire & cassinelli 1986 ) .",
    "although the association of the radio knots in he 2 - 10 with galactic uch regions appears appropriate , the two types of objects are not identical . in figure",
    "[ ratio ] we plot the ratio of the observed fluxes for knot 4 to those of w49a after scaling the latter to a distance of 9 mpc .",
    "w49a is one of the most well - studied galactic uch complexes and has been resolved into at least 30 individual uchs ( de pree et al .",
    "1997 ; conti & blum 2001 ) .",
    "we have taken the fluxes for w49a at the various frequencies from the results given by mezger , schraml , & terzian ( 1967 ) and ward - thompson & robson ( 1990 ) .",
    "figure [ ratio ] shows that flux ratio increases steadily with frequency , from a value of about 11 at 6 cm , to well over 200 at 12 @xmath55  .",
    "this suggests that the udhs contain far more dust than uchs relative to their ionizing luminosity .",
    "the trend in the flux ratio could be due to different mean ages for the stellar clusters within the two types of objects , as the ionizing luminosity from a cluster drops more rapidly than the bolometric luminosity as a cluster ages .",
    "however , such an explanation would require the mean age of the clusters in w49a to be substantially younger than those in the udhs in he 2 - 10 . with ages @xmath149 yr , the clusters embedded with the udhs are clearly very young .",
    "if the mean age of the clusters within w49a were larger than that for the udhs , one would expect the flux ratio to decrease with frequency , opposite of the trend seen in figure [ ratio ] .    because the flux ratio in figure [ ratio ] continues to increase from 100 to 12",
    "@xmath55  , the relative fraction of hot dust ( @xmath150k ) must be greater in the udhs than in w49a .",
    "the increased fraction of hot dust in the udhs in he 2 - 10 could be due to external heating from other starburst regions in the vicinty . given the tremendous star formation activity occuring in the center of he 2 - 10 , as well as the location of the knots close to , or on the edges of sites of vigorous star formation activity , this does not seem implausible .",
    "if external heating of the dust is significant , the bolometric luminosity ( and hence the lower mass limits ) for the embedded stellar clusters would be substantially smaller than we have estimated .",
    "however , the superb match between the radio and the @xmath2-band morphologies , the rather spherical shapes of the @xmath2-band knots , and the lack of any significant edge - brightening on the sides nearest the optical starburst regions suggests that the sscs detected in the uv / optical hst images do not provide a substantial fraction of this heating",
    ". we can attempt to estimate their heating contribution in the following way .",
    "if we assume that the optical sscs and the udhs are at the same relative distance , we can use the effective radii of the udhs measured from the @xmath2-band image to compute the solid angle subtended by any knot as seen from the sscs .",
    "knot 4 has @xmath151 pc and is located about 40 pc from three sscs seen in the uv and optical hst images of he 2 - 10 . assuming that these sscs have masses of @xmath152 , we estimate the maximum available bolometric luminosity impinging on knot 4 from these sources is @xmath153 . this is less than @xmath154% of the total infrared luminosity of the knot .",
    "chini , krgel , & wargau ( 1987 ) found a correlation between the bolometric luminosity of galactic uchs and their total gas mass ,    @xmath155    using the estimate of @xmath156 derived from our fit to the sed of knot 4 , we find that the bolometric luminosity of this knot is factor of 3 larger than predicted by the relation above . as discussed above",
    ", it is certainly possible that the optically thin models underestimate the total gas mass .",

    "the results of these comparisons _ may _ indicate that the total dust mass required to form a stellar cluster of a given mass increases non - linearly with the cluster mass .",
    "this in turn would imply that the star formation efficiency varies with the mass of the embedded cluster and is not nearly as high in the udhs as in the far less massive galactic uchs , which contain only one to a few massive o stars . however , given the uncertainties , and the numerous other possible explanations ( both observational and physical ) for the trend seen in figure [ ratio ] , this suggestion is clearly only speculative .",

( 1999 ) , and kj99 . we can attempt to remove the non - thermal component and measure @xmath187 , the @xmath15 value associated with only the thermal component ; this should reflect the @xmath15 values for the udhs . assuming that @xmath188 and that the intrinsic power spectrum index for synchroton emission is @xmath189 , we estimated the thermal fraction of the flux at 1.49 ghz from the observed radio spectral index and computed @xmath187 .",
    "we find @xmath190 for he 2 - 10 .",
    "carrying out the same procedure for the sample of 16 ulirgs discussed above for which radio spectral indices are available , we find a mean value of @xmath191 and a median value of 3.13 .",
    "given the approximate nature of the separation into thermal and non - thermal components , these values are reasonably close to those determined for the individual udhs in he 2 - 10 .",
    "how common might udhs be among starburst galaxies ?",
    "beck et al.(2000 ) have recently carried out radio mapping of a small sample of nine wolf - rayet galaxies . in most of these ,",
    "they find regions where the spectral slope increases with frequency , a signature of optically thick free - free emission .",
    "the estimated parameters for these regions are very similar to those of the udhs seen in he 2 - 10 and ngc 5253 . hence udhs",
    "appear to be quite common among this class of starbursts .",
    "of course , wolf - rayet galaxies are identified by the signatures of young massive stars in their integrated spectra ( e.g. , vacca & conti 1992 ) , so perhaps it is not surprising to find udhs in these objects .",
    "the above discussion naturally leads to the question of whether the fir flux in lirgs and ulirgs can possibly be produced by udhs . with @xmath192 ,",
    "he 2 - 10 clearly falls far short of the standard definition of a lirg ( @xmath193 ) or a ulirg ( @xmath194 ; e.g. , sanders & mirabel 1996 ) . however , he  2 - 10 is also a dwarf galaxy with @xmath195 ( kobulnicky et al .",
    "scaling its @xmath174 by the ratio of the molecular mass of a typical ulirg , such as arp  220 [ @xmath196 ; radford , solomon , & downes 1991 ; scoville , yun , & bryant 1997 ] to that of he 2 - 10 , we would predict a `` massive he  2 - 10 '' to have @xmath197 and contain approximately 100 udhs .",
    "this would imply that @xmath198 udhs are needed to power the fir emission from a ulirg .",
    "such a large number of udhs , all with ages @xmath199 yr , and all located within a small radius of only a few hundred pc , perhaps seems unlikely . nevertheless , the udh hypothesis is attractive as it naturally explains the large @xmath15 values found for ulirgs , as well as the dust temperatures and small sizes estimated for the starburst regions in these objects .",
    "perhaps a single very massive udh might be powering the fir flux in these sources .",
    "furthermore , because the dust masses in ulirgs are so much higher than that found in he 2 - 10 , it may well be possible that pressure confinement extends the lifetime of the udh phase in these objects .",
    "finally , the above comparison reveals that either ulirgs are overluminous relative to their mass compared to objects like he 2 - 10 , and hence their star formation efficiencies are much higher , or that @xmath200 alone is not a good tracer of the total material available for cluster formation .",
    "meurer et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1999 ) have shown that the ratio of the fir flux to that at 1600   is well correlated with the uv spectral slope , @xmath42 .",
    "this correlation has been interpreted as arising naturally from the fact that the hot stars which produce the uv flux heat the dust surrounding the star formation site where they were born .",
    "the dust absorbs and reprocesses the uv flux and emits it in the far infrared .",
    "meurer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) find that a foreground screen model and a fairly gray extinction curve provide the best fit to the observed correlation .",
    "it is interesting to determine where he 2 - 10 and ngc 5253 lie on the @xmath42 vs @xmath33 diagram .",
    "assuming that all of the observed flux in the iras bands for he 2 - 10 is the region seen in our @xmath2-band image , and using the uv flux value for this region , corrected for galactic extinction , given by johnson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we find that @xmath201 .",
    "the value of @xmath42 , after correcting the observed uv spectrum for galactic extinction , is @xmath202 .",
    "these values place he 2 - 10 slightly above the best fit line given by meurer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) but not far from it , and certainly within the spread of data points used to define the correlation . for ngc 5253 , @xmath203 , and @xmath204 ( meurer et al .",
    "1995 ) , which place ngc 5253 very close to the best fit line given by meurer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "since most , and perhaps almost all , of the fir flux in he 2 - 10 and ngc 5253 is generated by the compact radio knots , and does _ not _ represent reprocessed uv flux from the starbursts seen in the uv , optical , and near - infrared images of these galaxies , the obvious question then is , why do these objects appear to follow the correlation between @xmath33 and @xmath42 ?",
    "the uv flux and the fir emission are _ not _ generated by the same starburst regions . in fact , the udhs individually can not be plotted on this diagram at all , because they have no detectable uv flux .",
    "given that udhs may well be quite common in starburst galaxies , and hence may dominate the fir flux of these objects , it is surprising that the correlation demonstrated by meurer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) exists at all .",
    "in fact , it could be argued that this correlation indicates that udhs can not be common in starbursts or that their emission can not dominate the fir fluxes .",
    "however , the results presented by beck et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , discussed above , directly contradict this argument . alternatively , since at least some of the observed fir flux _ must _ be due to dust heated by the uv - visible starbursts , although most of the fir flux arises from udhs , one might expect that the correlation shown by meurer et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1999 ) should actually represent a _ lower envelope _ for an ensemble of starbursts . the fact that most ulirgs do appear to lie above the correlation reinforces this suggestion ( meurer et al .",
    "if this is indeed the case , then perhaps much of the scatter seen in the @xmath42 vs @xmath33 correlation presented by meurer et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1999 ) might be eliminated if the contribution of udhs could be removed from the total fir flux . on the other hand",
    ", the distribution of points around the correlation does not exhibit any substantial asymmetry toward higher values of @xmath33 , as one would expect if this relation is actually a lower envelope for starbursts in general .    in any case",
    ", if most of the fir flux in starbursts is indeed due to udhs , this immediately implies that the _ observed _ fir and 1600   fluxes are not causally connected in the straightforward manner suggested by the simple foreground dust screen reddening / reprocessing picture presented by meurer et al .",
    "rather , the correlation between @xmath33 and @xmath42 might instead represent merely a trend in the dust content among starburst galaxies : starbursts containing more numerous udhs are simply dustier in general .",
    "hence , the reddening of the observed uv continuum appears to correlate with the @xmath33 ratio , even though the _ observed _ fluxes in the fir and uv are not directly coupled .    the observed correlation in the @xmath42 vs @xmath33 diagram is naturally produced in the model presented by charlot & fall ( 2000 ) for dust absorption in starbursts .",
    "charlot & fall ( 2000 ) include the finite lifetime and optical depth of stellar birth clouds in their attempt to reproduce the inferred extinction law and the observed correlations of parameters in starburst galaxies .",
    "they find that , under the assumption of constant star formation , the presence and finite lifetimes ( @xmath205 yr ) of these birth clouds are key to reproducing the empirical observation that the reddening derived from the @xmath206 is generally larger than that derived from the uv continuum . in this model ,",
    "the ionizing photons responsible for the h lines arise primarily from hot stars deeply embedded in optically thick birth clouds , the uv arises from older stellar clusters whose birth clouds have dispersed , and the infrared emission is produced by dust reprocessing of non - ionizing uv flux from both populations in both environments ( birth clouds and ambient ism ) .",
    "however , most of the infrared emission ( typically @xmath207% ; s.charlot , private communication ) is generated by the dust reprocessing in the birth clouds .",
    "the observed @xmath33 vs. @xmath42 correlation arises in this model as a result of a trend in the overall dust content of starbursts , as suggested by our findings , rather than extinction and reprocessing from a foreground screen of dust .",
    "our gemini results , in which @xmath208% of the fir flux is produced by young stellar clusters deeply embedded in their birth clouds , provide strong support for this model .",
    "we have obtained @xmath2-band ( 10.8 @xmath3 m ) images of the starburst galaxy he 2 - 10 with oscir and the gemini north telescope .",
    "these images reveal the presence of four bright , compact knots ( with effective radii on the order of 10 - 20 pc ) which have no counterparts in the hst uv , hst optical , or ground - based near - infrared ( @xmath0 , @xmath4 , and @xmath1 ) images .",
    "however , the @xmath2-band morphology is extremely well - correlated with the radio maps presented by kj99 .",
    "therefore , we identify these knots with the udh regions found by kj99 .",
    "the four knots comprise about @xmath208 % of the total @xmath2-band flux from he 2 - 10 . assuming the morphology seen in the @xmath2-band image persists to longer wavelengths ( e.g. , 100 @xmath3 m ) ,",
    "we have scaled the observed iras fluxes from the galaxy by the fraction each knot contributes to the total @xmath2-band flux and combined the resulting values with the @xmath2-band and radio fluxes to generate seds for the individual knots .",
    "the seds bear a remarkable resemblance to those of galactic uch regions .",
    "we have constructed simple models to match the seds and have derived physical parameters for each knot .",
    "we find that the electron densities in the ionized regions surrounding the stellar clusters are on the order of @xmath209 @xmath24 , and radii of these regions are between 2 and 5 pc .",
    "the masses of the surrounding dust shells are about @xmath210 .",
    "the radio and ir fluxes also allow us to place constraints on the properties of the embedded stellar clusters . for the brightest knot",
    "we find a mass @xmath211 and an age @xmath212 yr .",
    "the stellar clusters within all of the knots must have ages less than @xmath213 yr and masses greater than @xmath214 .",
    "hence , we confirm the suggestion of kj99 that the radio knots represent deeply embedded sscs , and may be the youngest examples yet observed .    while the seds of the udhs appear to be similar to galactic uchs",
    ", a comparison between the brightest @xmath2-band knot ( # 4 ) and the galactic source w49a reveals that knot 4 emits far more ir flux relative to its radio flux than w49a .",
    "this suggests that , compared to galactic uchs , knot 4 contains far more dust relative to the ionizing luminosity of the embedded cluster . in addition , the fraction of hot dust is larger in this knot than in w49a . furthermore , the udhs do not follow the size - density relation found for galactic uchs",
    "it is not clear what causes these differences .",
    "it is also not certain whether knot 4 consists of a single embedded stellar cluster or of several clusters , each surrounded by their own cocoons .",
    "higher resolution radio and infrared observations would be useful to answer this question .",
    "the logarithmic ratio of the radio to far - infrared flux densities , @xmath15 , for the udhs in he 2 - 10 is @xmath16 . for both he 2 - 10 as a whole and ngc 5253 , another nearby starburst known to host udhs , @xmath17 .",
    "the latter @xmath15 value is significantly larger than the average @xmath18 found for normal galaxies , but comparable to the values of @xmath15 found for ultraluminous infrared galaxies .",
    "we suggest that large @xmath15 values for starburst galaxies may indicate that a significant fraction of the far - infrared flux may arise from dust emission from udhs .",
    "recent radio surveys seem to indicate that such udhs may be common among starburst galaxies . if this is indeed the case , a significant fraction of the star formation in these galaxies is occuring within regions that are completely hidden to uv , optical , and even near - infrared observations .",
    "this in turn raises important questions about the origin and meaning of the empirical @xmath33 correlation observed for samples of starbursts .",
    "attempts to address these issues would benefit from a much larger sample of @xmath2-band observations of nearby starburst galaxies .",
    "this paper is based on observations obtained with the mid - infrared camera oscir , developed by the university of florida with support from the national aeronautics and space administration , and operated jointly by gemini and the university of florida infrared astrophysics group .",
