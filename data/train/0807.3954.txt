    "the mechanism that produces the prompt gamma - ray emission in gamma ray burst ( grbs ) is still uncertain .",
    "the non - thermal character of the spectrum points out towards inverse compton ( ic ) and synchrotron as the two natural candidates .",
    "the latter become , somehow , the  standard \" process but the former remained always a serious alternative ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and others ) .",
    "the observations of numerous bursts with low energy spectral slopes that are inconsistent with synchrotron @xcite provided additional motivation to consider ic .",
    "recently @xcite have shown further inconsistency with the overall synchrotron model and suggested that synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) can resolve some of these problems .",
    "the recent observations of a naked eye optical flash from grb080319b @xcite that coincided in time with the prompt @xmath2ray emission provided further motivation to consider ic as the source of the prompt @xmath0-rays . among the different models that appeared so far @xcite , several favor models in which the prompt @xmath0-ray emission is ic of the optical flash and there have been suggestions that this is generic to many grbs .    motivated by these ideas we examine , here , the possibility that ic is the source of the prompt soft @xmath0-ray emission in grbs .",
    "this requires a soft component at the ir - uv range that serves as the seed for the ic process .",
    "the flux of these seed photons is constrained by observations ( or upper limits ) of the prompt optical emission .",
    "grb 990123 @xcite and grb 080319b @xcite are rare exceptions with very strong optical emission , @xmath3 and @xmath4 mag respectively .",
    "however most bursts are much dimer optically with observations or upper limits around 14 mag @xcite .",
    "this should be compared with fluxes of @xmath5 in soft gamma rays for a modest burst .",
    "what is important , in this work is the flux ratio @xmath6 which is typically larger than 0.1 during the peak soft gamma emission @xcite .",
    "the basic problem of the ic model can be explained simply .",
    "if the low energy seed emission is in the optical , while the observed soft @xmath0-ray spectrum is the first ic component , then second ic scatterings would create a tev component .",
    "upper limits or observations of the prompt optical signal show that the @xmath7 parameter , i.e. the ratio between the energy in the first ic component to that in the low energy seed photons is very large , typically greater than thousands .",
    "theory would then show that the second ic component in the tev range would carry an even larger amount of energy , again by a factor of @xmath8 , producing an  energy crisis \" for this model , and possibly violating upper limits from egret ( energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ) @xcite .",
    "this problem is generic and it does not depend on the specific details of the overall model .",
    "the above analysis is oversimplified and two factors may alleviate the energy catastrophe .",
    "first , the frequency of the seed photons may differ from that where upper limits exist , allowing larger seed flux and reducing the lower limits on @xmath7 .",
    "second , the klein - nishina ( kn ) suppression , which does not affect the first scattering , may affect the second , resulting in a lower @xmath7 parameter for the second scattering than the first one . in this article",
    ", we explore the parameter space to see weather there exist a regime where a combination of these two factors allows for less energy in the second ic component ( typically in the tev range ) than in the @xmath0-rays .",
    "we find that possible solutions are limited to a very small region in the parameters space in which the seed photons are in the ir , the bulk lorentz factor is very low @xmath9 ) and the electrons lorentz factor is very large ( @xmath10 .",
    "however , this solution implies a healthy emission in the ir , while self absorption limits it .",
    "therefore , when taking self - absorption into account , this solution is ruled out as well . a second possible solution exists if the seed photons are in the uv .",
    "this solution requires a very low electrons lorentz factor @xmath11 , and a seed photon flux that carries comparable energy to the observed prompt @xmath0-rays .",
    "furthermore , prompt x - ray observations limit the high energy tail of the uv component and practically rule out this model .",
    "we take the lorentz factor of the electrons and the bulk lorentz factor as free parameters and we estimate what is the second ic fluence ( at tev or multi gev ) given the observed prompt gamma - ray flux and the limits on the prompt optical band .",
    "most of our analysis is insensitive to the size of the source , which appears only in the final section when we estimate the self absorption flux . in our numerical examples we use very conservative parameters .",
    "for example we use r magnitude of 11.2 as an upper limit on the optical flux , while many limits are much stronger and the @xmath0-ray flux we take , @xmath12 , is quite modest .",
    "similarly we use conservative rather rather than  canonical \" values for the spectral slopes .",
    "consider electrons that move with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath13 while in the bulk ( or fluid ) rest frame they have a typical lorentz factor @xmath14 in a random direction .",
    "we examine ic scattering of seed photons with a peak frequency @xmath15 and a peak flux @xmath16 ( both measured at the observer s rest frame ) .",
    "we assume that the seed photons are roughly isotropic in the fluid s frame .",
    "this would be the case if the seed photons are produced by synchrotron radiation in the bulk , or any other mechanism local to the moving fluid .",
    "we will consider external ic , in which the seed photons are produced by an external source elsewhere .",
    "for simplicity we assume that all the photons have the same energy and all the electrons have the same lorentz factor .",
    "the energy and flux of the scattered photons are : @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the compton parameter and the optical depth in the thomson scattering regime .",
    "note that the unknown optical depth , @xmath20 , is introduced here in the definition of @xmath7 but it is not used elsewhere in the paper .",
    "our analysis is independent of this unknown factor .",
    "the factor , @xmath21 corresponds to the correction that arises if the scattering is in the kn region : @xmath22 the expression given in eq .",
    "[ fkn ] is approximate .",
    "again this approximation is sufficient for our purpose .",
    "we consider now the possibility that the prompt gamma - rays arise due to ic scattering of a lower energy component .",
    "we use now the observed gamma - ray flux , @xmath23 , and its peak energy , @xmath24 and the upper limits ( or detections ) of prompt optical emission , @xmath25 at @xmath26 to set limits on the ic process .",
    "the peak flux of the low energy component , @xmath27 , is at @xmath28 which is not necessarily at the observed frequency @xmath26 . given an upper limit on the prompt optical flux , @xmath29 at @xmath30 ( or on the flux at any other frequency ) , we can set a limit on @xmath27 if the optical frequency is in the same spectral region as @xmath28 , the peak frequency of the lower spectral component of slope @xmath31 : @xmath32 the equality here and elsewhere holds when @xmath29 corresponds to a detection and an inequality corresponds to an upper limit .",
    "there are two possibilities , either @xmath33 which we call the  uv solution \" or @xmath34 which we call the  ir solution \" .",
    "since by definition , the seed photon energy peaks at @xmath28 , we must have @xmath35 in the uv solution and @xmath36 in the ir solution .",
    "moreover , since the spectrum around @xmath28 is up - scattered to create the familiar band spectrum @xcite around @xmath24 , we can expect @xmath37 for the ir solution and @xmath38 for the uv solution .    as the first ic scattering results in soft @xmath0-rays , it is clearly away from the kn regime and we obtain , using eqs .",
    "( [ gamma],[flux],[limit ] ) a limit on the compton parameter @xmath39 , in the first compton scattering : @xmath40    using this limit we turn now to the second order ic component .",
    "this process will produce photons in the gev - tev range .",
    "as the scattered photon is energetic , it might be in the kn regime and we have : @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xmath43 is the ratio of energy emitted in the high energy ( tev ) band and in lower energy gamma - rays ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    as a conservative numerical example we will use the following typical parameters : @xmath44 , @xmath45 , leading to a ratio of @xmath46 . this optical flux corresponds to r magnitude 11.2 , which is a very conservative upper limit to the prompt optical emission of most grbs while the prompt gamma - ray flux is moderate .",
    "we use @xmath47hz and @xmath48 [ both energies are larger by a factor of @xmath49 than the observed frequencies , r band and 250kev ] .",

    "we find two possible regimes for ic solutions that are not over producing a high energy ( tev ) component .",

    "uv solutions with @xmath75 are therefore also wasteful as they require a large ( @xmath76 ) low energy component .",
    "a second problem arises , for this solution , with the spectral shape .",

    "thus this solution is a very inefficient .",
    "the analysis above is based on the optical limits but for the modest values of @xmath80 needed for the uv solution , @xmath28 , the peak flux frequency of the seed photons becomes large ( eq . [ gamma ] ) and",

    "<S> inverse compton ( ic ) scattering is one of two viable mechanisms that can produce the prompt non - thermal soft gamma - ray emission in gamma - ray bursts . </S>",
    "<S> ic requires low energy seed photons and a population of relativistic electrons that upscatter them . </S>",
    "<S> the same electrons will upscatter the gamma - ray photons to even higher energies in the tev range . using the current upper limits on the prompt optical emission </S>",
    "<S> we show that under general conservative assumption the ic mechanism suffers from an  energy crisis \" . </S>",
    "<S> namely , ic will over - produce a very high energy component that would carry much more energy than the observed prompt gamma - rays , or alternatively it will require a low energy seed that is more energetic than the prompt @xmath0-rays . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is general and it makes no assumptions on the specific mechanism that produces the relativistic electrons population .    gamma rays : bursts@xmath1ism : jets and outflows  radiation mechanisms : nonthermal </S>"
