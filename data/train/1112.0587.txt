    "one of the most attractive features of ultracold fermi gases is the universal physics arising from their intrinsic dilution .",
    "a fermi gas of volume density @xmath1 is dilute when @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the fermi momentum and @xmath4 is the range of the interaction .",
    "when this condition is realized the interactions are controlled only by the s - wave scattering length @xmath5 and the details of the potential become irrelevant .",
    "therefore the physics is controlled by the inverse gas parameter @xmath6 and a universal phase diagram can be drawn , regardless of the nature of the fermions involved @xcite .",
    "moreover , fano - feshbach resonances @xcite allow to tune the interaction from weak- to strong - coupling realizing ( i ) the crossover from the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superfluidity ( @xmath7 ) to a bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of preformed pairs ( @xmath8)@xcite and ( ii ) the unitary limit in which the scattering length diverges , and the system has no characteristic length scale other than @xmath9 leading to an extra universality which attracted a remarkable interest @xcite .    in a different framework , the physics of superconductors beyond the bcs regime , including the high - tc materials , has triggered the investigation of lattice models with attractive interactions .",
    "the typical electronic densities in these materials are far from the dilute limit , being instead closer to the so - called half - filling regime in which the number of fermions equals the number of lattice sites .",
    "however , a bcs - bec crossover takes place also in this regime @xcite even if no universality is expected .    in this work we focus on the connection between these two different realizations of the bcs - bec crossover .",
    "the main effect of the lattice is to lift the galilean translational invariance introducing a characteristic length scale , the distance between two lattice sites , or lattice spacing .",
    "the reduced translational invariance makes the fermionic spectrum bounded from above or , in other words , introduces an ultraviolet _ energy cut - off_.    when the number of fermions is of the same order of the number of sites the underlying lattice influences the properties of the fermionic gas substantially .",
    "reducing the density , the lattice becomes less and less relevant , and in the dilute limit the properties of lattice fermions are expected to converge to the universal features of dilute gases .",
    "the evolution of the properties of a lattice model by reducing the density is an interesting topic _ per se _ , also in light of the possibility to study the bcs - bec crossover in optical lattices at various particle densities @xcite , but it can also be used to benchmark and test theoretical studies in which the properties of dilute gases are obtained through a low - density extrapolation of lattice models , as done in recent lattice quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) approaches to the unitary fermi gas @xcite .    in a previous work @xcite",
    ", we used static and dynamical mean - field theory @xcite at the unitary limit .",
    "we proved that finite - density corrections to the dilute unitary limit can be large even at small densities and that the dependence on the specific lattice is hardly washed out at any finite density .",
    "therefore a safe extrapolation to the dilute limit is in general extremely difficult .    in this work",
    "we extend the analysis in the whole bcs - bec crossover and we focus on the origin of the finite - density corrections . in order to gain some analytical understanding",
    ", we use a static mean - field theory , which allows to treat on the same footing the lattice and continuum cases .",
    "the simplicity of the approach helps us to identify the origin of the leading density - corrections to the dilute limit together with their functional dependence on the inverse gas parameter @xmath10 in the whole crossover .",

    "first we identify the lattice counterpart of the inverse gas parameter @xmath10 , then we discuss the role of the specific dispersion of the lattice and of the ultraviolet cut - off .",
    "finally we cast some general considerations in the form of a phase diagram in the relevant parameter space .      as briefly discussed in the introduction , for a dilute fermi gas interacting via a short - range potential the only relevant parameter to describe the interaction is the s - wave scattering length @xmath5 and the properties of the system are defined by the inverse gas parameter @xmath11 . in this subsection",

    "the inset show a magnified view of the the region around the unitary point . ]    we can extend our analysis of the leading - order corrections to the dilute limit .",
    "we start from the hartree shift of the chemical potential @xmath146 where we emphasized the dependence of @xmath147 on @xmath16 along the trajectories at constant @xmath10 . since @xmath148 differs from @xmath34 only at the order @xmath0 ( see eq .",
    "( [ u_eta ] ) ) the leading - order correction ( @xmath149 ) due to this term is identical to the one at unitarity for every value of @xmath10 .",
    "this observation implies that the analytic expressions for the leading - order lattice corrections due to the cut - off in the @xmath108 model given by eqs .",
    "( [ asympt1 ] ) and ( [ asympt2 ] ) are valid in the whole crossover , provided that we evaluate @xmath118 and @xmath119 using @xmath150 and @xmath151 which solve the leggett equations for the given @xmath10 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] , we show the results for @xmath152 and @xmath153 in the crossover region .    in the bcs limit",
    "@xmath7 the contribution due to the cut - off is vanishingly small , @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "therefore @xmath156 , given by the hartree shift , and @xmath157 .",
    "the vanishing of the correction due to the cut - off can be understood by considering that in the bcs limit pairing only involves an exponentially small region of energies around the fermi energy @xmath158 and the cut - off region gives an exponentially small contribution .    in the case of the @xmath108 model",
    "the hartree shift and the cut - off contribution alone determine the leading - order correction , but on a generic lattice , like , e.g. , the semicircular dos model , we can have contributions arising from the differences in the functional form of the density of states .",
    "computing explicitly these corrections for the semicircular dos in the bcs regime , we find that they are of order @xmath159 .",
    "this observation shows that at weak - coupling , the difference in the dos does not contribute to the leading - order corrections . on the other hand , as shown in our results about the unitary point , this is not true outside the bcs regime .",
    "turning back to the @xmath108 model , we find that beyond the bcs regime @xmath118 and @xmath119 are always sizeable , generalizing the result obtained at unitarity , that the cut - off plays a crucial role in determining the leading - order corrections even if @xmath160 .",
    "this is essentially due to fact that outside the bcs regime pairing involves a wider region of energies whose size increases going to the bec limit . as expected , in the bec regime the size of the corrections explodes , being several order of magnitude larger already for moderately large values of @xmath10 . as evident from the inset in fig . [",
    "fig : fig8 ] , @xmath99 is always negative and has a rather broad maximum slightly shifted towards the bec side .",
    "@xmath100 always increases with @xmath10 being negative in the bcs limit and positive in the bec limit .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the unitary point @xmath62 does not show any special behavior with respect to the finite - density lattice corrections .",
    "our analysis shows that the presence of a lattice is hardly irrelevant even at very small density .",
    "moreover we have shown that there is no easy shortcut to overcome this poor convergence as a function of density .",
    "even what we label lattice gas 1 , whose dos differs from the bare one only for the unavoidable presence of a cut - off , has sizeable leading - order corrections , and the reduction of the effective range can only reduce the quantitative effects .",
    "these considerations are crucial in light of the explosion of lattice approaches to bcs - bec crossover in dilute fermi gases , mainly based on qmc simulations @xcite and dmft @xcite .",
    "we remark that our analysis only refers to lattice simulations and it does not pretend to predict the behavior of low - density corrections in continuum space .",
    "qmc approaches for attractive models provide very accurate results ( or at the very least upper bounds ) for _ finite - size _ lattice models _ at finite density @xmath16_. our point is that , even for exact methods , a great care is needed to extract reliable information on the actual dilute system in the thermodynamic limit .    even after a careful extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit",
    "is performed in order to eliminate finite - size effects , a further extrapolation of the dilute limit @xmath96 is still required to access universal and therefore model - independent features in the dilute regime .",
    "precise results require therefore simultaneously large lattices and large number of particles .",
    "we argue that one of the reasons why current qmc results are scattered around the most precise experimental estimates ( see e.g. @xcite ) rather than converging to them , is that non - universal lattice features are still present at the densities considered in these approach and not properly taken into account .",
    "our analysis clearly shows that choosing a given density and assuming that it is small enough for the properties of the system to coincide with the dilute limit can lead to substantial deviations , especially if the densities are of order @xmath161 as in refs . @xcite . at these densities the deviations from the dilute gas behavior",
    "can not be considered as small ( see e.g. figs [ fig : mf_unitary_1 ] and [ fig : fig7 ] ) , especially if the aim is the quantitative evaluation of the dilute gas properties , like , e.g. , the existence of a small pseudogap at unitarity .",
    "the agreement with recent experimental results @xcite is most likely resulting from a cancellation of residual finite - size and finite - density effects .    while the need of a careful extrapolation to the dilute limit has been realized by different authors ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the lack of an underlying theory which explains the actual relevance of these corrections makes the extrapolation potentially uncontrolled .",
    "in particular , it is important to understand that one does not simply need to reach small densities , but it is also necessary to include in the fit _ only _ data in a region close to @xmath162 where a proper power - law behavior is present .",
    "our investigation shows that this region can be very small , and densities of the order ot @xmath163 are definitely outside and should not be included in the fit .",
    "for example , the different values of the critical temperature at unitarity calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite are likely explained by the lower minimal density used in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath164 , five times smaller than @xmath165 in ref .",
    "@xcite , even if a different size extrapolation has been invoked to justify the discrepancy .",
    "we also notice that the linear fit to extrapolate @xmath166 at unitarity in ref .",
    "@xcite includes data at density as high as @xmath167 , which are clearly not in the asymptotic @xmath168 regime according to the results in this paper and in ref . @xcite .",
    "also this effect is likely to affect the extrapolation and , as a general remark , only the data at the lowest should be used in the fit procedures in order to extract precise estimates for the dilute fermi gas free from uncontrolled errors .",
    "in this paper we studied the connection between the bcs - bec crossover in dilute gases and in lattice models at finite density .",
    "more specifically we investigated within mean - field how several relevant observables in different lattice models all converge to those of a dilute gas as the density is reduced along suitable trajectories with constant gas parameter @xmath169 . comparing with the solution of a dilute fermi gas in continuum space",
    ", we analyzed quantitatively how the properties of lattice systems converge to the dilute limit .",
    "in analogy with the finite - size effects , which can be minimized through the knowledge of the expected dependence on the size of the system , a theoretical understanding of the power - law density corrections to the dilute regime is a crucial step towards a proper zero - density extrapolation .",
    "the mean - field results presented in this paper , though approximate , are meant to be a guideline to control the extrapolation . moreover ,",
    "mean - field results are free from the interplay with finite - size effects , since our approach directly deal with the problem in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "our results clearly show that , despite the universal nature of the dilute limit , finite density corrections depend on the specific choice of lattice . moreover ,",
    "these corrections persist down to extremely low densities , making any extrapolation based on lattice model at finite density very hard unless data at extremely low - densities are available .",
    "the leading order corrections to all the relevant observables at small densities follow a @xmath0 power - law behavior for every lattice studied here and in ref .",
    "the prefactors instead depend on the specific lattice and vary over several order of magnitude as the lattice parameter spans the bcs - bec crossover , being larger on the bec side .",
    "the @xmath0 behavior also holds for a model with the same dos of free fermions except for a sharp energy - cut - off which enforces the reduced translational symmetry of the lattice .",
    "in this case we also derived an exact analytical expression for the leading - order prefactors in the whole crossover .",
    "this result shows unambiguously that the presence of a high - energy cut - off @xmath33 associated with the broken galilean invariance affects the properties of the system down to arbitrarily low finite densities .",
    "this finding contradicts the common belief -valid only in the weak - coupling bcs regime- that only the low - energy behavior up to the fermi energy @xmath170 determines the leading - order correction to the dilute limit . comparing different lattices",
    "we show that also the differences of the dos at finite energy far from the fermi level contribute to the leading - order corrections . as a consequence ,",
    "the prefactors of the leading density corrections are non universal and there is no simple recipe to cancel or even minimize them .",
    "the relevance of the dos contrasts the idea that the leading - order corrections depend only on the low - energy scattering properties .",
    "this rules out the possibility to cancel the leading - order density corrections tuning the effective range to zero as proposed in @xcite , and seems to exclude a simple way to express the corrections in terms of a single parameter .",
    "the inclusions of fluctuations beyond mean - field is crucial for a quantitative description of the bcs - bec crossover both in the dilute gas and in lattice models .",
    "however , fluctuations can even increase the sensitivity of the system to density variations , as found in ref .",
    "@xcite comparing static and dynamical mean - field theory for lattice models at unitarity and in @xcite where the relevance of density corrections to extrapolate the critical temperature is investigated including gaussian fluctuations .",
    "the same enhancement of lattice - dependent features is expected to happen in finite - temperature data with respect to @xmath58 @xcite .    during completion of the present work ,",
    "we became aware of a very recent monte carlo study@xcite which shows a sizable effect of reducing the fermionic density from @xmath171 to @xmath172 , in line with our results .",
