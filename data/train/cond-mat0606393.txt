    "the discovery of superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 @xcite has revived the interest in two - band superconductors @xcite .",
    "most experiments on this compound @xcite are consistent with two distinct superconducting gaps @xmath1 and @xmath2 , with @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the only exception seems to be the nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) relaxation rate @xmath4 @xcite in the superconducting state .",
    "the nmr relaxation rate measurements on @xmath5b nucleus by kotegawa _",
    "_ @xcite found a small hebel - slichter coherence peak @xcite just below the superconducting transition temperature @xmath6 , although there are some questions as to whether the peak is present at all @xcite .",
    "moreover , by assuming that the contributions to the relaxation rate from the two bands are simply additive kotegawa _",
    "et al . _ found @xcite a better fit to their data on @xmath5b nuclei by assuming that only one band participates in the nuclear relaxation process .    in a recent work @xcite",
    "we have examined the nmr relaxation rate in both conventional and unconventional _",
    "clean _ two - band superconductors .",
    "the essence of our findings is that if the fermi contact interaction between the nucleus and the conduction electrons dominates the relaxation mechanism , then the measurements of @xmath4 probe the properties of the electron subsystem which are local in real space and hence extremely non - local in the momentum space @xcite .",
    "we showed that for a two - band superconductor this gives rise to inter - band interference terms in @xmath4 , in addition to direct contributions from each band .",
    "here we consider the effect of nonmagnetic impurity scattering on @xmath4 for a two - band superconductor .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the interband scattering by nonmagnetic impurities reduces the transition temperature of an _ s_-wave two - band superconductor . in the case of mgb@xmath0",
    "it has been argued @xcite that one requires defects which produce lattice distortions in order to achieve large enough interband scattering which would lead to a significant suppression of @xmath6 .",
    "experimentally , such reduction of @xmath6 was observed on samples of mgb@xmath0 irradiated by fast neutrons @xcite .",
    "however , there is a finite interband scattering by impurities even in unirradiated and undoped mgb@xmath0 as evidenced by the break - junction tunneling experiments @xcite whose interpretation was essentially based on the work of schopohl and scharnberg @xcite on the tunneling density of states of a disordered two - band superconductor .",
    "the interband scattering rate from the low gap band to the high gap band used to fit the tunneling data in @xcite was comparable to the transition temperature of 39 k. thus it seems reasonable to investigate the effect of disorder on @xmath4 over a wide range of scattering rates .",
    "the nmr relaxation rate in a superconductor is determined by both normal and anomalous local density of states . in the case of a two - band superconductor",
    "these quantities depend on the interband scattering @xcite and on temperature @xcite in a rather complex way and one can not a priori guess the effect of disorder on the temperature dependence of @xmath4 except in the limits of a small and very large interband impurity scattering rate . in the former case the peaks in the partial densities of states",
    "are somewhat reduced and broadened by the interband scattering compared to the clean system and one would expect the hebel - slichter coherence peak in @xmath4 below @xmath6 to be reduced and broadened by disorder . in the limit of a very large interband scattering such that the gap functions in the two bands become nearly equal ( the anderson limit @xcite ) , the difference between the local densities of states in the two bands has no consequences and one expects to find the temperature dependence of @xmath4 characteristic of a single - band superconductor , with the size of the hebel - slichter peak determined by the strength of the electron - phonon coupling in the system @xcite . in the case of mgb@xmath0 , which is a medium coupling superconductor @xcite ,",
    "the hebel - slichter peak is expected to be quite large in the anderson limit .",
    "indeed we find that our detailed numerical calculations of @xmath4 over a wide range of the interband impurity scattering rates confirm such a trend .",
    "the rest of the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , we summarize the strong coupling theory of the nmr relaxation rate in a disordered _ s_-wave two - band superconductor assuming that the fermi contact interaction between the nuclear spin and the conduction electrons provides the dominant relaxation mechanism . in sec .",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] we give conclusions .",
    "the relaxation rate of a nuclear spin due to the hyperfine contact interaction with the band electrons is given by @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the hyperfine coupling constant , @xmath9 is the nmr frequency , and @xmath10 is the analytic continuation of the fourier transform @xmath11 of the imaginary time correlator @xmath12 averaged over the impurity configurations . here",

    "@xmath14 contains both electron - phonon and screened coulomb interactions as well as the scattering off randomly located nonmagnetic impurities .",
    "we assume that there are two spin - degenerate electron bands in the crystal ( the generalization to an arbitrary number of bands is straightforward ) , and neglect the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "then the spin operators ( [ spm ] ) can be written in the band representation , using @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the bloch functions , which are periodic in the unit cell . inserting these into eqs .",

    "@xcite we argued that the contribution to the vertex functions @xmath26 from the electron - phonon interaction can be ignored while the effect of the coulomb interaction drops out from the ratio @xmath27 . in calculating the contibution to @xmath28 from the impurity scattering in the conserving approximation @xcite",
    "one considers only the ladder impurity diagrams since the self - energies are calculated in the self - consistent second born approximation .",
    "we have shown recently @xcite that in the case of a single three - dimensional band the contribution to the vertex function @xmath29 from the ladder impurity diagrams is of the order @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the impurity scattering rate and @xmath32 is the fermi energy , and that the impurity vertex corrections can therefore be neglected .",
    "the same applies to the contribution to @xmath28 from the ladder impurity diagrams since the structure of the impurity ladder diagrams for the @xmath28s is completely analogous to the single - band case .",
