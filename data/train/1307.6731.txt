    "since the first detection of chaotic motions in 1964 ( henon  heiles @xcite ) , several indicators have been largely used to characterize the different dynamics of dynamical systems .",
    "many dynamical indicators , such as the lyapunov characteristic exponents and the more recently introduced finite  time chaos indicators ( such as the finite time lyapunov exponent ",
    "ftle @xcite , fast lyapunov indicator ",
    "fli @xcite , mean exponential growth of nearby orbits ",
    "megno @xcite ) , are defined by the local divergence of nearby initial conditions , that is by the variational dynamics .",
    "for example , for a discrete dynamical system defined by the map @xmath1 with @xmath2 open invariant , by denoting with @xmath3 the tangent map of @xmath4 at @xmath5 : @xmath6 the characteristic lyapunov exponent of a point @xmath7 and a vector @xmath8 is defined by the limit @xmath9 and the largest lyapunov exponent of @xmath5 is the maximum of @xmath10 for @xmath11 . as a matter of fact , the numerical estimation of the characteristic lyapunov exponents ( see @xcite ) relies on extrapolation of finite time computations , since computers can not integrate on infinite time intervals .",
    "the so  called finite  time chaos indicators ( such as the ftle , the fli and the megno ) have been afterwards introduced as surrogate indicators of the largest lyapunov exponent , with the aim to discriminate between regular orbits and chaotic orbits using time intervals which are significantly smaller than the time interval required for a reliable estimation of the largest characteristic lyapunov exponent ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the function fast lyapunov indicator of @xmath5 and @xmath12 is simply defined by @xmath13 and depends parametrically on the integer @xmath14 , as well as on the choice of a norm on @xmath15 .",
    "the definition of finite time chaos indicators was justified by the possibility of their systematic numerical computation over large grids of initial conditions in the phase ",
    "space in a reasonable computational time .",
    "we remark that , specifically in celestial mechanics , the numerical detection of the resonances of a system using dynamical indicators , both formulated using the lyapunov exponent theory or alternatively the fourier analysis ( such as the frequency analysis @xcite ) , is one of the major tools for studying its long  term instability ( for recent examples , see @xcite ) .",
    "the papers @xcite,@xcite , focused and proved properties of the finite time chaos indicators , specifically the fli , which are lost by taking the limit of @xmath16 , thus differentiating the use of these indicators from the parent largest lyapunov characteristic exponent .",
    "specifically , since @xcite,@xcite , the fli has been used to discriminate regular motions of different nature : for example the motions which are regular because are supported by a kam torus from the regular motions in the resonances of a system .",
    "this property of the fli improved a lot the precision in the numerical localization of different types of resonant motions , the so  called arnold web , and provided the technical tool for the first numerical computations of diffusion along the resonances of quasi ",
    "integrable systems in exponentially long times @xcite , as depicted in the celebrate arnold s paper @xcite .    more recently",
    ", the fli has been successfully used to compute the stable and unstable manifolds of normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds of the standard map and its generalizations @xcite , and of the three ",
    "problem @xcite . in these cases",
    "it happens that , depending on the choice of the parameter @xmath17 , finite pieces of the stable and unstable manifolds appear as sharp local maxima of the fli . as a matter of fact",
    ", the possibility of sharp detection of the stable and unstable manifolds of a fixed point , or periodic orbit , with a fli computation is not general and turns out to be a property of the manifolds .",
    "a model example is represented by the stable and unstable manifold of the fixed point @xmath18 of the symplectic map @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the phase  space variables , @xmath21 is a parameter : for @xmath22 the fli may be used for excellent detection of the manifolds ; for @xmath23 the fli does not provide any detection .",
    "to explain this fact , in this paper we provide a representation for the growth of tangent vectors for orbits with initial conditions close to the stable manifold of a saddle fixed point .",
    "to better illustrate the theory , we consider a two dimensional area  preserving map with a saddle fixed point @xmath24 , but the techniques which we use ( the local stable manifold theorem and lipschitz estimates ) can be used also in the higher dimensional cases .",
    "the two dimensional case allows us to treat also poincar sections of the circular restricted three body problem .",
    "let us denote by @xmath24 the saddle point of the map , and by @xmath25 its stable and unstable manifold .",
    "we consider a point @xmath26 , a tangent vector @xmath27 , and we provide estimates about the norm of the tangent vector @xmath28 , for points @xmath29 which are close to @xmath30 . as it is usual , the same arguments applied to the inverse map @xmath31 , allow to reformulate the result by exchanging the role of the stable manifold with that of the unstable manifold . for the points @xmath5 which are the suitably close to @xmath26",
    ", the orbit @xmath32 follows closely the orbit @xmath33 for any @xmath34 , and @xmath35 remains close to @xmath36 as well .",
    "the most interesting situation happens for the points @xmath5 which are little more distant from the stable manifold : their orbit ( i ) follows closely the orbit @xmath33 only for @xmath37 smaller than some @xmath38 ; ( ii ) then remains close to the hyperbolic fixed point ( for a number of iterations which increases logarithmically with respect to some distance between @xmath5 and @xmath30 , see section [ section2 ] ) , ( iii ) then follows closely the orbit of a point on the unstable manifold @xmath39 in the remaining iterations .",
    "it is during the process ( iii ) that the growth of the tangent vector @xmath35 can be significantly different from the growth of @xmath36 , and the difference may be possibly used to characterize the distance of @xmath5 from the stable manifold . as a matter of fact , with evidence any difference may exist only due to the non  linearity of the map @xmath4 . in section [ section2 ]",
    "we provide a representation for such a difference , and we discuss a condition which guarantees the desired scaling of the fli with respect to the distance of @xmath5 from the stable manifold .",
    "if this condition is satisfied , the computation of the fli on a grid of initial conditions provides a sharp detection of the stable and unstable manifolds ( see section [ section3 ] ) : typically , the time @xmath17 used for the fli computation , which is the time needed by the orbits with initial condition @xmath5 to approach the fixed point @xmath24 , turns out to be proportional to the number of precision digits of the detection .    at the light of the representation provided in section [ section2 ] , we propose a generalization of the fli which weakens a lot the condition for the detection of the stable and unstable manifold . for any smooth and positive function @xmath40",
    "we define the modified fli indicator of @xmath7 , @xmath27 at time @xmath14 , as the @xmath17th element of the sequence @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the traditional fli is obtained with the choice @xmath44 for any @xmath7 .",
    "we consider the alternative case of functions @xmath45 which are test functions of some neighbourhood @xmath46 of the fixed point , and precisely with @xmath44 for @xmath47 , and @xmath48 for @xmath5 outside a given open set @xmath49 .",
    "when the diameter of the set @xmath50 is small , but not necessarily extremely small , the computation of the modified fli indicator allows to refine the localization of the fixed point by many orders of magnitude .",
    "therefore , at variance with the traditional fli indicator , the modified indicators are proposed as a general tool for the numerical detection of the stable and unstable manifolds .",
    "an illustration of the potentialities of these indicators is given in section 3 , where we provide computations of the stable and unstable manifolds and their heteroclinic intersections , of the lyapunov orbits around @xmath51 , @xmath52 of the circular restricted three ",
    "body problem .",
    "the application is particularly critical , since these manifolds are located in a region of the phase ",
    "space close to the singularity due to the secondary mass .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we provide the representation for the evolution @xmath28 of the norm of tangent vector @xmath12 for points @xmath29 which are suitably close to the stable manifold , and we also discuss a sufficient condition for the fli to detect sharply the stable and unstable manifolds of the map . in section 3",
    "we provide an illustration of the method for the computation of the stable and unstable manifolds of the lyapunov orbits around @xmath51 , @xmath52 of the circular restricted three body problem ; in section 4 we provide the proof of proposition [ pro1 ] . in section 5 we formulate and prove two technical lemmas .",
    "finally , conclusions are provided in section 6 .",
    "we consider a smooth two  dimensional area  preserving map : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a @xmath55 diagonal matrix with @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 is at least quadratic in @xmath59 , that is @xmath60 and @xmath61 , for any @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , the origin is a saddle fixed point .",
    "we need to introduce some constants which characterize the analytic properties of @xmath4 .",
    "we denote by @xmath63 the lipschitz constants of @xmath64 respectively defined with respect to the norm @xmath65 , in the set @xmath66 .",
    "also , we set @xmath67 such that , for any @xmath68 , we have @xmath69 @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the hessian matrix of @xmath58 at the point @xmath5 and , by denoting with @xmath72 the inverse map , we also have @xmath73 @xmath74 moreover , since @xmath4 is a diffeomorphism , we have @xmath75 by the local stable manifold theorem , we consider e neighbourhood @xmath76 of the origin where the local stable and unstable manifolds @xmath77 are cartesian graphs over the @xmath78 and @xmath79 axes respectively , that is @xmath80 @xmath81 with @xmath82 , @xmath83 and , by possibly increasing @xmath67 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 @xmath86 we denote by @xmath25 the stable and unstable manifolds of the origin .",
    "we consider a point @xmath26 , a tangent vector @xmath27 , and we provide estimates about the norm of the tangent vector @xmath28 , for points @xmath29 which are suitably close to @xmath30 , precisely in a curve @xmath87 , with @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "let us consider a small @xmath90 , with @xmath91 satisfying @xmath92 then , we consider the minimum @xmath93 such that @xmath94 .",

    "we rename the vector @xmath105 as follows : @xmath106 where @xmath107 are the orthogonal projections of @xmath108 over the stable and unstable spaces of the matrix @xmath54 , i.e. the @xmath78 and @xmath79 axes , respectively .",
    "we need a condition which ensures that @xmath12 is not close to some special contracting direction .",

    "since @xmath118 depends continuously on @xmath96 , @xmath119 , and the local stable manifold is invariant , there exists @xmath120 such that @xmath118 is strictly monotone increasing function of @xmath121 $ ] .",
    "we have also ( see section [ proofs ] ) : @xmath122 so that if @xmath123 we have @xmath124",

    ". we also denote by @xmath128 the parallel projection of @xmath129 over the local unstable manifold .",
    "[ pro1 ] let us consider any large @xmath17 satisfying @xmath130 with @xmath131 by denoting with @xmath132 the constant such that @xmath133 then , for any @xmath134 , if @xmath135 we have @xmath136 if @xmath137",
    "we have @xmath138    0.4 cm the proof is reported in section [ proofs ] . 0.4 cm * remark .",
    "* conditions ( [ conteps1 ] ) , ( [ conteps2 ] ) and ( [ conteps3 ] ) may be all satisfied by times @xmath17 which are suitably large , but not necessarily extremely large , because of the presence of the exponentials in ( [ conteps1 ] ) and ( [ conteps2 ] ) , and because of the typical dependence @xmath139 .",
    "therefore , the proposition is meaningful also for @xmath132 which are small , but not necessarily extremely small .",
    "moreover , from the definition of @xmath132 , apart from a small difference due to the use of the integer part in the definition of @xmath140 , we have @xmath141 , and @xmath142 .",
    "@xmath143 0.4 cm for @xmath26 , and for all the points @xmath87 which are so close to the stable manifold that @xmath135 , the fli is approximated by @xmath144 therefore , the only possibility for the fli to strongly decrease by increasing @xmath96 is that , for @xmath145 , we have an exponential decrement of @xmath146 with respect to @xmath147 .",
    "the assumption which guarantees a desired scaling of the fli with respect to @xmath96 is @xmath148 with some @xmath149 , so that we have @xmath150 from the definition of @xmath140 , we have therefore a linear decrement of the fli with respect to @xmath151 , up to the maximum value of @xmath152 .",
    "therefore , at the exponentially small distance from the manifold ( [ delepszero ] ) the fli has decreased of a quantity which is proportional to integration time @xmath17 , and conversely , the differences of units in the fli value typically determines a proportional number of precision digits in the localization of the stable manifold .    with evidence ,",
    "condition ( [ condition ] ) may be satisfied if @xmath153 has an absolute maximum for @xmath154 .",
    "for example , the condition may be satisfied for the map ( [ modelmap ] ) with @xmath22 , since the origin is a local strict maximum for @xmath155 , @xmath156 , while it is not satisfied for @xmath23 , since in this case the origin is a local strict minimum for @xmath155 , @xmath156 . in any case , it is not practical to verify if condition ( [ condition ] ) is satisfied by a certain choices of the parameters .",
    "therefore , at the light of the above analysis , we consider a generalization of the fli indicators which depend on a function @xmath40 as follows : let us consider @xmath7 , @xmath157 , and @xmath14 .",
    "then , we consider @xmath158 defined as the @xmath17th element of the sequence @xmath159 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the usual fli is obtained by @xmath44 for any @xmath7 .",
    "we consider the alternative case of functions @xmath45 which are test functions of some neighbourhood @xmath46 of the fixed point , and precisely with @xmath44 for @xmath47 , and @xmath48 for @xmath5 outside a given open set @xmath49 .",
    "we remark that the set @xmath50 needs to be small , but not necessarily extremely small .",
    "for example , if @xmath160 , we only need , in @xmath161 , @xmath162 for some @xmath149 .",
    "the function @xmath163 described above depends on a specific hyperbolic fixed point .",
    "if one is interested in the stable or unstable manifolds of more fixed points ( or hyperbolic periodic orbits ) , with the same numerical integration of the variational equations , forward and backward in time , one may compute the fli indicators related to the different fixed points without increasing significantly the computational time , and use the results to find , for example , homoclinic and heteroclinic intersections between the different manifolds .",
    "if instead , one is interested in determining with a single numerical integration the largest number of manifolds in some finite domain @xmath164 , one can divide the domain @xmath164 in many small sets @xmath165 , @xmath166 , and compute the @xmath167 indicators fli@xmath168 adapted to the sets @xmath169 .",
    "this procedure increases the computational time only logarithmically with @xmath167 , since the time required for the numerical localization of a point in one of the sets @xmath169 increases logarithmically with @xmath167 .",
    "then , the portrait of all the manifolds is obtained by representing , for any initial condition , the maximum between all the fli@xmath168 .",
    "therefore , at variance with the traditional fli indicator , the modified indicators are proposed as a general tool for the numerical detection of the stable and unstable manifolds .",
    "the circular restricted three - body problem describes the motion of a massless body @xmath170 in the gravitation field of two massive bodies @xmath171 and @xmath172 , called primary and secondary body respectively , which rotate uniformly around their common center of mass . in a rotating frame",

    "we analyze the fli method for the detection of the tube manifolds introduced in @xcite at the light of the theoretical analysis performed in section [ section2 ] , and we show that the method allows for a detection of the manifolds with a number of precision digits which increase linearly with respect to the integration time . moreover , the modified fli allows us to compute the manifolds with a precision limited only by the round  off of the numerical computations .",

    "we remark that these computations are particularly critical since the tube manifolds are located in a region of the phase space close to the singularity at @xmath191 . in these circumstances ,",
