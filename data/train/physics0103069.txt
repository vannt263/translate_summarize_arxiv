    "all introductory physics textbooks , with or without calculus , cover the addition of both resistances and capacitances in series and in parallel . the formul  for adding resistances [ eq:1 ] r & = & r_1 + r_2 +   , + [ eq:2 ] 1r & = & 1r_1 + 1r_2 +   , and capacitances [ eq:3 ] 1c & = & 1c_1 + 1c_2 +   , + [ eq:4 ] c & = & c_1 + c_2 +   , are well - known and well - studied in all the books .    in books with calculus",
    "there are often end - of - chapter problems in which students must find @xmath0 and @xmath1 using continuous versions of equations ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:4 ] ) @xcite .",
    "however , we have found _ none _ which includes problems that make use of continuous versions of equations ( [ eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 ] ) @xcite .",
    "students who can understand and solve the first class of problems should be able to handle the second class of the problems , as well .",
    "we feel that continuous problems that make use of all four equations should be shown to the students in order to give them a global picture of how calculus is applied to physical problems .",
    "physics contains much more than mathematics .",
    "when integrating quantities in physics , the way we integrate them is motivated by the underlying physics .",
    "students often forget the physical reasoning and they tend to add ( integrate ) quantities only in one way .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce an approach to solving continuous versions of equations ( [ eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 ] ) that is as straightforward and logical for the students as solving continuous versions of equations ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:4 ] ) .",
    "we then present some problems in which the student must decide which formula is the right one to use for integration .",
    "we hope that this article will motivate teachers to explain to students the subtle points between ` straight integration ' as taught in calculus and ` physical integration ' to find a physical quantity .",
    "* problem * [ cylindrical resistor ] + the cylindrical resistor shown in figure [ fig:1 ] is made such that the resistivity @xmath2 is a function of the distance @xmath3 from the axis .",
    "what is the total resistance @xmath0 of the resistor ?    .",
    "a potential difference is applied between the bases of the cylinder and therefore electric current is running parallel to the axis of the cylinder.,width=377 ]    * towards a solution * :    we divide the cylindrical resistor into infinitesimal resistors in the form of cylindrical shells of thickness @xmath4 .",
    "one of these shells is seen in red in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "if we apply equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) naively , we must write @xmath5 the infinitesimal resistance of the red shell is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the area of the base of the infinitesimal shell . since @xmath4 is small , @xmath8 is huge , which is absurd . where is the error ?    * discussion * :    when the current is flowing along the axis of the cylinder , the infinitesimal resistors are not connected in series .",
    "therefore , the naive approach @xmath9 does not work since this formula assumes that the shells are connected in series .",
    "instead , all of the infinitesimal cylindrical shells of width @xmath4 are connected at the same end points and , therefore , have the same applied potential . in other words ,",
    "the shells are connected in parallel and it is the inverse resistance that is importnat , not @xmath0 itself .",
    "specifically @xmath10 students may feel unconfortable with this equation as at the begining since it may seem ` contradictory ' to their calculus knowledge ; therefore , some discussion may be helpful .",
    "equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) states that when resistors are connected in series , they make it harder for the current to go through .",
    "their resistances add to give the total restistance .",
    "however , when resistors are connected in parallel , many ` paths ' are available simultaneously ; the current is flowing easily and ` resistance ' which is a measure of flow difficulty is not a good quantity to use .",
    "maybe an analogy from everyday life is useful here .",
    "paying tolls at toll booths is in direct analogy .",
    "when only a single booth is available , then all traffic has to go through that lane and no matter how dense the traffic is , there will be a relative delay .",
    "the traffic encounters some ` resistance ' in the flow .",
    "however , when multiple booths are open , the drivers choose to go through the lanes that are free at the time of their approach to the booths and thus the delays encountered are minimal . in this case , the ` availability ' of booths is a better quantity to be used to descibe what is happening instead of the ` resistance ' at the booths .",
    "ultimately , the two quantities are related , but intuitely it is more satisfying to use one over the over depending on the situation . in direct analogy , for resistors connected in parallel , the relevant quantity is not @xmath0 any longer , but @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the conductivity .",
    "@xmath11 is called the * conductance * of the resistor . when resistors are connected in parallel ,",
    "they make it easier for the current to go through .",
    "their conductances add to give the total conductance : @xmath14 thus , the conductance follows the usual addition @xmath15 when infitesimal resistors are connected in parallel .",
    "we are now in position to compute the answer to the posed problem in a way that is consistent with the intuition of the students .",
    "* solution * :    since the cylindrical shells are connected in parallel , conductance is the additive quantity . for the infinitesimal shell @xmath16",
    "therefore s=_cylinder ds 2 _ 0^a ( r ) r dr  .",
    "for example , if @xmath17 , then s= 2_0 a^2  , where @xmath18 .",
    "the resistance is therefore r_02 a^2  .",
    "* problem * [ truncated - cone resistor ] + a resistor is made from a truncated cone of material with uniform resistivity @xmath2 .",
    "what is the total resistance @xmath0 of the resistor when the potential difference is applied between the two bases of the cone ?    * solution * :    this is a well - known problem found in many of the introductory physics textbooks @xcite .",
    "we can partition the cone into infitesimal cylindrical resistors of length @xmath19 .",
    "one representative resistor at distance @xmath20 from the top base is seen in figure [ fig : cone ] .",
    "the area of the resistor is @xmath21 and therefore its infinitesimal resistance is given by @xmath22 from the figure we can see that @xmath23    .,width=264 ]    the infinitesimal resistors are connected in series and therefore r=_cone dr = h(c - b ) _",
    "b^c drr^2 = hbc  .",
    "[ eq : rcone ]    * comment * : however , this solution , which is common in textbooks @xcite , tacitly assumes that the disks used in the partition of the truncated cone are equipotential surfaces .",
    "this is of course not true , as can be seen quite easily .",
    "if they were equipotential surfaces , then the electric field lines would be straight lines , parallel to the axis of the cone",
    ". however , this can not be the case as , close to the lateral surface of the cone , it would mean that the current goes through the lateral surface and does not remain inside the resistor",
    ". therefore , the disks are not equipotential surfaces .",
    "one way out of this subtlety is to assume that the disks are approximate equipotential surfaces as suggested in @xcite .",
    "this is the attitude we adopt in this article as our intention is not to discuss the validity of the partitions used in each problem , but to emphasize the unified description of resistances and capacitances as additive quantities .",
    "similar questions can be raised and studied in the majority of the problems mentioned in the present manuscript .",
    "a reader with serious interests in electricity is referred to the article of of romano and price @xcite where the conical resistor is studied .",
    "once that article is understood , the reader can attempt to generalize it to the rest of the problems of our article .",
    "a similar discussion may be given for capacitors . when capacitors are connected in parrallel",
    ", capacitance is the the relative additive quantity : @xmath24 for a parallel - plate capacitor of area @xmath25 and distance @xmath26 between the plates @xmath27 when the capacitor is filled with a uniform dielectric of dielectric constant @xmath28 then @xmath29 however , when capacitors are connected in series , the inverse capacitance @xmath30 is the additive quantity",
    ". we may call it the * incapacitance*. for a parallel - plate capacitor @xmath31 in other words , when capacitors are connected in series @xmath32    problems like this are encountered when we fill a capacitor with a dielectric for which the dielectric constact is a function of the distance from the plates of the capacitor .",
    "students are familiar with such problems for a parallel - plate capacitor in the discrete case . for example , problems asking students to compute the total capacitance in cases as those shown in figure [ fig : dielectrics ] are found in several textbooks @xcite .",
    "however , continuous problems are not found in any textbook @xcite .",
    "we can easily construct new problems or re - work old problem using this idea .",
    "for example , the well - known formula for the capacitance of a cylindrical capacitor can be found this way .",
    "as shown in the left side of figure [ fig : hollowcylinder ] , the capacitor is partitioned into small cylindrical capacitors for which the distance between the plates is @xmath4 .",
    "for such small capacitors , the formula of a parallel - plate capacitor is valid .",
    "we notice though that all infintesimal capacitors are connected in series",
    ". therefore @xmath33 and @xmath34 the total capacitance is then @xmath35     and @xmath36 and height @xmath37 . in the left picture ,",

    "such capacitors look simpler than the infitesimal cylindrical shell we used above .",
    "furthermore , they are connected in parallel ( notice that each capacitor is carrying an infinitesimal charge @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) and therefore it is enough to deal with capacitance , @xmath40 , and not incapacitance @xmath41 .",
    "however , with a minute s reflection the reader will see that in order to use the parallel - plate capacitor formula in the infinitesimal case , the distance between the plates must be infinitesimal which indicates that the infinitesimal capacitors must be connected in series . in the proposed ( blue )",
    "slicing , the distance between the plates of the infinitesimal capacitor is finite , namely @xmath42 .",
    "the infinitesimal capacitor is still a cylindrical capacitor of infitesimal height and therefore its capacitance should be expressed in a form that is not known before the problem is solved . in other words , dc  =   2_0(b / a ) dz [ eq : unknown ] from which c  =   2_0(b / a ) _ 0^h",
    "dz  =   2_0(b / a ) h  .",
    "[ eq : known ] but the expression ( [ eq : unknown ] ) is unkown until the result ( [ eq : known ] ) is found .",
    "[ truncated - cone capacitor ]    a capacitor is made of two circular disks of radii @xmath36 and @xmath43 respectively placed at a distance @xmath37 such that the line that joins their centers is perpendicular to the disks .",

    "these infitesimal capacitors are connected in series and therefore the incapacitance is the relevant additive quantity : @xmath44 notice that the computation is identical to that of @xmath0 with final result : d 1_0 hbc   c= _ 0 bch  .",
    "[ eq : trunccone ] when @xmath45 , we recover the result of the parallel - plate capacitor .",
