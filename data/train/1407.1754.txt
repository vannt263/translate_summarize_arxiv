    "the term cutoff was coined by aldous and diaconis @xcite and its occurrence for the transposition shuffle was proved by diaconis and shahshahani @xcite .",
    "it is thought to hold for many natural sequences of markov chain as soon as @xmath21 where @xmath22 corresponds to the spectral gap of the chain @xmath4 ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",

    "more precisely the conditioncis necessary and it is was proposed by peres as a natural sufficient condition provided the chain is  nice enough \" . as is in fact known to be a necessary condition for pre - cutoff , this would imply in particular than pre - cutoff implies cutoff for `` nice chains '' .    shortly after was proposed as a sufficient condition for cutoff , aldous constructed a chain that satisfies and displays pre - cutoff , but for which cutoff does not hold .",
    "pak also constructed a counter - example ( with no pre - cutoff ) which is a random walk on a cayley graph ( see ( * ? ? ? * pp 253256 ) ) .",
    "since then it has been a challenge to find a large class of markov chain for which the condition is a sufficient one .",

    "the idea of using the hellinger distance to obtain an optimal bound also for the total - variation distance ( developped in section [ ptv ] ) is due to yuval peres .",
    "the separation distance to equilibrium for @xmath24 is given by    @xmath35    hence for @xmath36 fixed and @xmath0 sufficiently large we have    @xmath37    where the last inequality is due to the submultiplicativity property for the separation distance    @xmath38    hence the result .",

    "* chapter 4 ) ) @xmath69 combining and , we have for every @xmath6 @xmath70    let us try now to prove the result from ( inequality on the left ) and in a naive way .",
    "we have @xmath71 and hence using again ( inequality on the right ) we obtain @xmath72 which is not satisfying .    to find a way out",
    ", we have to prove that if the inequality on the left in is sharp for @xmath6 , the inequality on the right can not be sharp for @xmath73 .",

    "the inequality is obtained by noticing that when @xmath90 we have @xmath91 while when @xmath92 , @xmath93 , we have @xmath94    now we can decompose @xmath95 into a sum of two function @xmath96 and @xmath97 : one which has a small @xmath98 norm , and one which has a small @xmath99 norm .",
    "@xmath100    we have @xmath101 setting @xmath102 one has    @xmath103    from one has ( using to bound @xmath62 ) @xmath104 moreover @xmath105 we are now ready to bound @xmath106 .",
    "we split it into two parts .",
    "the first one is bounded thanks to @xmath107 for the second part , note that as @xmath108 we have @xmath109 where the last inequality comes from , and the one before from the fact that @xmath110 this allows us to conclude .",
    "let us now define a sequence @xmath4 such that @xmath24 displays no cutoff .",
    "the idea build on the counter example of aldous displayed on ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pp 256 ) .",
    "the state - space of @xmath4 is the vertex set @xmath111 of a graph @xmath112 with @xmath113 edges and @xmath113 vertices defined as follows :    * there is a segment of @xmath114 edges linking @xmath113 vertices .",

    "* there is an extra edge linking the midle point of the segment ( which we call @xmath117 ) to @xmath116 .        with this definition",
    "it is not difficult to check that @xmath4 is a reversible markov chain .",
    "we have chosen @xmath118 to be exponentially small but the result we are going to present whould remain valid for @xmath119 for all @xmath0 ( or any other value smaller than @xmath12 ) . note that the value of @xmath120 is determined by that of @xmath118 in order to have reversibility .",
    "the main idea of the proof is that the total variation distance can be expressed in terms of the distribution of the time @xmath124 or @xmath125 needed to reach @xmath115 ( for @xmath4 ) or @xmath126 ( for @xmath24 ) starting from @xmath115 . in particular , there is cutoff if and only if this time is concentrated around its mean . for @xmath4 we show that @xmath124 concentrates around @xmath0 , whereas for @xmath24 , @xmath125 will be about @xmath114 if at least one of the coordinates @xmath127 decides to use the red path between @xmath117 and @xmath116 ( which happens with a non - vanishing probability ) .",
    "the equilibrium measure @xmath3 gives a weight @xmath128 to the vertex @xmath116 , and hence the equilibrium measure @xmath129 of @xmath24 , gives weight @xmath130 to @xmath126 . because of this remark we have @xmath131    for @xmath132 or @xmath133 , let @xmath134 resp .",

    "@xmath125 be the first hitting time of @xmath138 resp .",
    "@xmath139 .",
    "we provide the proof for @xmath8 as the other is identical .",
    "first let us prove the result for @xmath142 , and we will check later that for @xmath143 both @xmath8 and @xmath144 are @xmath145 . now",
    "the probability that a jump in the direction @xmath115 ( a backtrack ) occurs before time @xmath146 is exponentiallty small in @xmath0 and thus from we have        from an obvious coupling , we see that @xmath115 is the point of the segment @xmath149 which makes @xmath124 the largest .",
    "it remains to check that starting from one of the @xmath150 inside points the red segment @xmath117 and @xmath116 can not make @xmath124 larger : by conditioning to the event that @xmath4 does not backtrack before @xmath6 ( which is an event of almost full probability ) we see that @xmath124 starting from @xmath115 is bounded from below by a sum of @xmath151 iid standard exponentials whereas in the @xmath152 branches it is bounded from above by the sum of @xmath0 iid standard exponentials .",
    "finally , for @xmath153 , as conditioned on no backtrack , @xmath124 starting from @xmath115 is a bounded from above by a sum of @xmath114 iid standard exponentials , both @xmath154 and @xmath8 are @xmath145 ( and the fact both functions are decreasing allows to conclude for larger values of @xmath6 ) .      concerning @xmath4 , one can remark that conditioning to the event that @xmath4 does not backtrack and uses a short branch to reach @xmath138 , @xmath124 is a sum of @xmath157 iid standard exponentials .",
    "hence as the event to which we are conditioning has a probability tending to one , we have      and @xmath4 exhibits cutoff .",
    "however , the slow branch plays a crucial role for the product chain as the probability to hit @xmath138 from the longer branch asymptotically behaves like @xmath159 . as a consequence we have      under @xmath161 the probability that @xmath4 backtrack before time @xmath146 is exponentially small in @xmath0 and",
    "thus can be neglected .",
    "conditioned on no backtracking , the probability to use the red segment @xmath152 is equal to @xmath159 .",
    "now conditioned on using the red segment , @xmath124 is a sum of @xmath114 iid standard exponentials whereas conditioned on using the green edge @xmath124 is a sum of @xmath151 iid standard exponentials . hence the result .                from reversibility @xmath166 so that one can without loss of generality",
    "consider that @xmath77 is the point closer to @xmath115 on the red segment .",
    "let @xmath167 be the number of red edges between @xmath77 and @xmath168 .",
    "then @xmath169 is bounded from below by the probability of the event : in the time interval @xmath170 $ ] the walk @xmath4 ( starting from @xmath77 ) makes exactly @xmath167 jumps following the red path from @xmath77 to @xmath168 .    as the jump rate for @xmath11 is always of order @xmath12 ( except at point @xmath116 ) , the probability of making exactly @xmath167 jumps in the time interval @xmath170 $ ] is larger than @xmath171 for some constant @xmath172 .",
    "the probability of not following the red path conditioning to the number of jump is at least @xmath173 ( a backtrack is exponentially unlikely , and if the path goes through @xmath117 the chance of choosing the right direction there is equivalent to @xmath159 ) .",
    "hence there exists a constant @xmath174 such that when @xmath0 is sufficiently large @xmath175      from the previous lemma ( and the definition and reversibility ) , one has for all @xmath178 @xmath179 which according to shows that the difference between total - variation and separation distance for this chain is negligible .",
