    "the magellanic clouds ( large , lmc , and small , smc ) are irregular , gas - rich dwarf galaxies in our local group .",
    "the presence of a bar - like structure  especially prominent in the lmc  suggests that they could have originally been barred spiral galaxies transformed into present - day irregular galaxies due to their tidal interactions with one another and with the milky way . at a distance of 48.5 kpc ( macri et al .  2006 ;",
    "freedman et al .  2010 ) , the lmc is the third closest galaxy to the milky way . with an inclination of @xmath9 ( haschke et al .",
    "2011 ) it offers us an excellent view of its structure and content .",
    "the smc is located at a distance of @xmath10 kpc ( hilditch et al.2005 ) with an inclination of only @xmath11 ( subramanian et al .",
    "2011 ) .    probing the star formation history ( sfh ) in galaxies",
    "informs us about galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "star clusters revealed differences in the sfh between the lmc and the milky way ( hodge 1960 ; sagar & pandey 1989 ) : the lmc contains a larger fraction of young clusters relative to the milky way .",
    "other methods of determining the sfh include a comparison of the observed colour  magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) with the model - built cmds ( e.g. , bertelli et al .",
    "harris & zaritsky ( 2009 ) used multi - color photometry of millions of stars over @xmath12 deg@xmath13 of the lmc to derive the sfh ; they found multiple episodes of star formation between 5 to 0.1 gyr ago in addition to an initial burst of star formation @xmath14 gyr ago . in a recent study , cignoni et al.(2013 ) studied various fields within the bar and wing of the smc and confirmed a dominant intermediate - age star formation epoch .",
    "their derived metallicity for the fields support a well mixed metal content of the smc .",
    "the cmd approach has also revealed that the most recent star formation , as young as @xmath15 myr , is confined to the central regions in both the lmc and smc ( indu & subramanian 2011 ) .",
    "our approach to investigate the sfh is based on employing long period variable stars ( lpvs ) .",
    "these are mostly asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars at their very late stage of evolution , as well as more massive red supergiants ( rsgs ) .",
    "the agb stars alone have low- to intermediate - mass ranges which relate to diverse ages and hence time epochs in the past , and they can thus be used to derive star formation rates ( sfrs ) over much of a galaxy s cosmological evolution .",
    "the agb stars develop unstable mantles which cause radial pulsation at periods of one or a few years ; they are luminous ( @xmath16 l@xmath1 ) and cool ( @xmath17 k ) and hence stand out at near - infrared wavelengths",
    ". their colours can be further reddened by enhanced atmospheric opacity due to carbon - dominated chemistry ( in carbon stars ) or due to attenuation by circumstellar dust produced in their winds .",
    "thanks to recent large - scale , extended monitoring projects such as ogle - i , ii , iii , macho and others , we are now in a position to use lpvs to study these nearby galaxies .    the data and the methodology are described in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we present our analysis and the results . in section 4",
    "we present the sfh derived from our analysis .",

    "( 2011 ) . in the case of the lmc",
    ", they used the eros-2 survey which started functioning efficiently from 1996 ; it employed two cameras enabling observations at two wavelengths , blue ( be ) and red ( re ) , simultaneously .",
    "after seven years of monitoring , it provided a database of 856,864 variables in the lmc of which 43,551 are considered lpvs ( spano et al .",
    "the eros-2 survey covered an area of 88 deg@xmath18 on the lmc , which is a superior coverage in comparison with other projects such as macho and ogle - iii which covered areas on the lmc of 13.5 deg@xmath18 and 40 deg@xmath18 , respectively .",
    "spano et al .",
    "cross - identified the eros-2 lpv candidates with variable stars from the ogle - iii and macho surveys .",
    "they found nearly 60% of lpvs in common between eros-2 and macho ; the difference is attributed to differences in sky coverage between the surveys ( spano et al .",
    "2011 ) . for the smc , soszyski et al .",
    "used the ogle - iii project which has monitored an area of 14 deg@xmath18 on the smc .",
    "after 13 years of monitoring in the optical v- and near - infrared i - band , the ogle survey has provided a database of about 6 million stars in the smc of which 19,384 are identified as lpvs are detected ( soszyski et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "as mentioned , agb stars become surrounded by dust , which causes reddening and makes them particularly faint in optical bands .",
    "therefore , infrared ( ir ) studies are preferred . for a comparison and more detailed study of the core region we also utilise ita et al.s ( 2004a ) data of variable stars in the magellanic clouds .",
    "this catalogue had been obtained by cross - identifying the ogle - ii and sirius data ( simultaneously observated in j- , h- , and k - band ) .",
    "the total area covered by the sirius survey is 3 deg@xmath18 and 1 deg@xmath18 in the lmc and smc , respectively , covering the core region of these galaxies  in particular , the bar of the lmc ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "spano et al .  ( 2011 ) cross - matched the eros-2 survey with 2mass near - ir ( and _ spitzer _ mid - ir ) data , within a search radius of @xmath19 . for the smc , we cross - matched the original catalogue of soszyski et al .",
    "( 2011 ) with 2mass , also within a search radius of @xmath19 .",

    "22 and 23 in their paper ) , from which sequence c is considered as miras pulsating in the fundamental mode .",
    "sequence d comprises mostly of stars with secondary long periods that are probably not due to the same radial pulsation we are after , but it does contain some dusty lpvs that have lengthened pulsation periods as a result of diminished mass ( ita et al.2004b ; spano et al .",
    "2011 ) . for the purpose of this study we select variables belonging to sequence c , and variables with `` only '' one period in sequence d.",
    "an appropriate stellar evolution model is provided by the padova group ( marigo et al .",
    "lpvs are expected to be at the end - points of the agb ( or rsg ) part of the isochrones in cmds .",
    "thus , the padova isochrones were fitted to the cmds of the magellanic clouds in order to correct the reddened lpvs ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "two different groups of reddening slopes are seen , those with steeper slopes are associated with those stars surrounded by oxygeneous dust whilst some with shallower slopes are associated with carbonaceous dust .",
    "not all stars are reddened ; the correction is applied only to those stars which have @xmath24 mag .",
    "the total mass of stars formed between @xmath25 and @xmath26 depends on star formation rate , @xmath27 , as @xmath28 thus , @xmath29 , the number of stars formed , is defined by the following equation : @xmath30\\,{\\rm d}m(t),\\ ] ] in which @xmath31 is the initial mass function .",
    "the nominator represents the total number of stars within the mass range of @xmath32@xmath33 , whilst the denominator gives their total mass .",

    ", the photometry needs to be de - reddened .",
    "the ( de-)reddening slope in the cmd depends on whether the dust is oxygenous or carbonaceous in composition .",
    "stars with a birth mass in the range of 1.54 m@xmath1 are expected to have become carbon stars due to the third dredge - up of nculear - processed material material with a carbon : oxygen ratio in excess of unity . in stars with a birth mass @xmath94 m@xmath1",
    ", third dredge - up is not sufficiently efficient , whilst , for stars with a birth mass @xmath95 m@xmath1 nuclear burning of the carbon at the bottom of the convection zone prevents the surface to be enriched in carbon .",
    "the reddening correction equation is @xmath96 where @xmath41 is the average slope for each dust type .",
    "the procedure followed was to first apply a correction assuming carbonaceous dust .",
    "if the mass resulting from this corrected k - band magnitude ended up in the range 1.54 m@xmath1 then the star was treated as a carbon star .",
    "otherwise , the correction was replaced by one assuming oxygenous dust , and a mass was derived accordingly .",

    "generally , since a massive star evolves faster , its pulsation duration is shorter . thus , low mass stars are more likely to be identified as variables , in comparison to more massive stars .",

    "given the above argument , the star formation rate estimated using lpvs is shown to be underestimated by a factor of 10 ( javadi et al .  2013 ) in comparison to the star formation rate obtained using @xmath103 emission , for instance .",
    "this inaccuracy was exposed by a mismatch between the integrated mass loss and birth mass . to reconcile both the mass loss budget and star formation rate with independent evidence , the pulsation duration adopted from the marigo et al .",

    "two formation epochs are seen ; one epoch @xmath106 gyr ago ( @xmath122 ) when almost 48 per cent of the total stellar mass within the bar was formed , and a more recent epoch starting @xmath123 gyr ago ( @xmath124 ) which lasted until as recent as 500 myr ago ( @xmath125 ) , within which almost 30 per cent of the total stellar mass was formed ( the total stellar mass in the covered area is @xmath126 m@xmath1 ) .",

    "the sfrs obtained for both catalogues agree rather well , however , the ita et al .",
    "data indicate a relatively more pronounced secondary ( recent ) episode of star formation .    by excluding the stars in the bar / central regions of the galaxies ( amounting to 3 deg@xmath18 and 1 deg@xmath18 in the lmc and smc , respectively )",

    "conversely , we also isolated the sfh of the bar / central regions by subtracting that derived for the immediately surrounding regions ( which could also be seen in projection against and/or mixed with any distinct sfhs belonging to the bar / central regions ) .",
    "figure 7 shows a comparison between the sfhs derived for the different regions . in case of the lmc ,",
    "the second peak of star formation is not seen in the outer region whilst for the smc , another remarkable peak of star formation is still observed in outer region .",
    "the latter is in good agreement with the work by ripepi et al .",
    "( 2014 ) who , using the optical step survey , found regions of high levels of star formation in the north and in the wing of the smc .    figure 8 shows the ratio of the sfr in the central regions compared to that in the outer regions .",
    "each bin in the histograms contain an equal number of stars .",
    "note also the logarithmic scale .",
    "the lmc shows a steady concentration of younger stars in the central regions .",
    "a similar result was reported by meschin et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , who found an ancient star formation epoch dating back 10 gyr , followed by more recent star formation activity 41 gyr ago .",
    "they also found younger stellar populations to be more centrally concentrated ; in other words , the stellar population ages as one moves away from the center of the galaxy .",
    "any such trend in the smc is less obvious , though might also be present .",
    "dynamical effects will have resulted in the migration of old stars towards the outskirts , so it is impossible to tell on the basis of this work whether star formation activity has always been centrally concentrated , or whether it has progressed further inwards as the galaxies matured .",
    "as the dynamical timescale is not much more than 100 myr , stars that were formed more than a gyr ago will have equilibrated their kinematics with the gravitational potential well  unless they have been exposed to recent tidal disturbances .",
    "we find a significant difference in the ancient sfh of the lmc and the smc .",
    "for the lmc , the bulk of the stars formed @xmath134 gyr ago , while the strongest episode of star formation in the smc occurred a few gyr later .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of weisz et al .",
    "( 2013 ) obtained through cmd analysis of optical ( hubble space telescope ) photometry obtained in a few small regions in the centres and outskirts of the magellanic clouds .",
    "they argued that the relative enhancement in the sfh of the smc is a consequence of the interaction with the lmc , with a stronger impact on the global star formation of the smc due to its much smaller mass compared to the lmc .",
    "the smaller size of the smc may also have resulted in the slower assembly at early times , similar to what was found in m33 ( javadi et al .",
    "this would be easier to understand if the smc and lmc did not form as a pair , but at least the smc was formed in isolation .",
    "a secondary peak of the sfh for the central part of the lmc has been reported in other studies , e.g. , smecker - hane et al .",
    "( 2001 ) who found a dominant star formation activity within the bar of the lmc at intermediate ages .",
    "having isolated the sfh of the bar of the lmc from that of the disc , it has become clear that the bar formed a few gyr ago and has maintained its star formation until very recently ( @xmath135 myr ) .",
    "however , the secondary peak in sfr in the smc is much sharper ( in duration ) and occurred @xmath136 myr ago .",
    "there is indeed a similar peak noticeable in the sfh of the lmc , and this is thus distinct from the star formation activity related to the bar itself .",
    "the co - eval 700-myr bursts in the smc and lmc are arguably due to the tidal interaction between the magellanic clouds and possibly their approach of the milky way ( cf .",
    "bekki & chiba 2005 ; indu & subramaniam 2011 ) .",
    "the lmc catalogues we have worked with are limited to @xmath137 myr due to the lack of more massive stars ( brighter stars ) because of saturation of the detectors used in the surveys . however , ulaczyk et al .  ( 2013 ) presented a catalogue of brighter stars that had been saturated in the main ogle catalogue . on the basis of this bright sample",
    "we derive the recent sfh in the lmc using the methods described above ( fig .",
    "we find a sfr of @xmath138 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 at @xmath139 myr , i.e.  similar to that over the past gyr or so ( compare , for instance , with figure 4 ) .",
    "after applying a correction to the pulsation duration of lpvs as predicted by the stellar evolutionary models ( see javadi et al .",
    "2013 ) , the resulting sfrs are now in very good agreement with those obtained in other studies ( e.g. , harris & zaritsky 2004 , 2009 ; cignoni et al .",
    "however , a recent investigation by the padova group of their own models revealed a severe over - estimation of the lifetimes of thermal - pulsing agb stars ( girardi et al .",
    "2013 ) which could also have implications for the duration of the radial pulsation phase .",
    "indeed , the techniques we have pioneered in m33 ( javadi et al .  2011 , 2013 ) , and now applied in the magellanic clouds , offer a promising avenue towards exposing the assembly and development of galaxies as well as improving models for the late stages of stellar evolution and mass loss .",

    "<S> we present the first reconstruction of the star formation history ( sfh ) of the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) using long period variable stars . </S>",
    "<S> these cool evolved stars reach their peak luminosity in the near - infrared ; thus , their k - band magnitudes can be used to derive their birth mass and age , and hence the sfh can be obtained . in the lmc , we found a 10-gyr old single star formation epoch at a rate of @xmath0 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 , followed by a relatively continuous sfr of @xmath3 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 , globally . in the core of the lmc ( lmc bar ) , a secondary , distinct episode is seen , starting 3 gyr ago and lasting until @xmath4 gyr ago . in the smc , two formation epochs are seen , one @xmath5 gyr ago at a rate of @xmath6 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 and another only @xmath7 gyr ago at a rate of @xmath8 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is also discernible in the lmc and may thus be linked to the interaction between the magellanic clouds and/or milky way , while the formation of the lmc bar may have been an unrelated event . </S>",
    "<S> star formation activity is concentrated in the central parts of the magellanic clouds now , and possibly has always been if stellar migration due to dynamical relaxation has been effective . </S>",
    "<S> the different initial formation epochs suggest that the lmc and smc did not form as a pair , but at least the smc formed in isolation .    </S>",
