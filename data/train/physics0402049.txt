    "the study of the dynamics of dust contaminated plasmas ( dp ) has recently received considerable interest due to their occurrence in real charged particle systems , e.g. in space and laboratory plasmas and the novel physics involved in their description @xcite .",
    "an issue of particular interest is the existence of special acoustic - like oscillatory modes , e.g. the dust - acoustic waves ( daw ) and dust - ion - acoustic waves ( diaw ) , which were theoretically predicted about a decade ago @xcite and later experimentally confirmed @xcite .",
    "the daw , which we consider herein , relies on a new physical mechanism in which inertial dust grains oscillate against a thermalized background of electrons and ions which provide the necessary restoring force .",
    "the phase speed of the daw is much smaller than the electron and ion thermal speeds , and the daw frequency is below the dust plasma frequency .",
    "a long - known generic characteristic of nonlinear wave propagation is amplitude modulation due to the nonlinear self - interaction of the carrier wave , which generates higher harmonics .",
    "the standard method for studying this mechanism is a multiple space and time scale technique @xcite , which leads to a nonlinear schrdinger - type equation ( nlse ) describing the evolution of the wave envelope .",
    "it has been shown that , under certain conditions , waves may develop a benjamin - feir - type ( modulational ) instability ( mi ) , i.e. their modulated envelope may collapse under the influence of external perturbations .",
    "furthermore , the nlse - based analysis , already present in a wide variety of contexts @xcite , reveals the possibility of the existence of localized excitations ( solitary wave structures ) whose form and behaviour depends on criteria similar to the ones necessary for the mi to occur .",
    "not surprisingly , plasma wave theory has provided an excellent test bed for this approach since a long time ago [ 7 , 11 - 19 ] and dusty plasma waves were no exception [ 20  22 ] . among other noteworthy results ,",
    "electron plasma modes have been shown to be stable against parallel modulation @xcite ; so do the ion plasma modes , yet only for perturbations below a specific wavenumber threshold @xcite .",
    "electron and ion acoustic modes , even though stable to parallel modulation @xcite , are found to be unstable if one takes into account finite temperature effects @xcite or , most interesting to us , when subject to an oblique modulation of the wave amplitude [ 17  19 ]",
    ". these results , based on poisson - moment plasma equations , have been confirmed by similar studies from a kinetic point of view @xcite , for the ion - acoustic wave in an electron - ion plasma . in dusty plasma",
    ", the amplitude modulation of the daw and diaw has been investigated in ref . [ 20  22 ] ; similar studies have been carried out for oscillations in ( strongly - coupled ) dusty plasma quasi - crystals [ 25 - 26 ] .",
    "finally , let us mention that attempts have been made to refine the description of the diaw modulation by including non - planar geometry effects @xcite , following an idea applied earlier in the kdv ( korteweg - de vries ) description of a dusty plasma @xcite , and dust - charge fluctuation effects @xcite , an issue of particular importance in the present - time dp surveys ( see e.g. @xcite ; also @xcite ) .",
    "these effects , omitted in the present investigation , will be considered in a forthcoming work .    in this paper",
    ", we study the modulational instability of dust - acoustic plasma waves propagating in an unmagnetized plasma contaminated by a population of charged dust grains , whose dimensions and charge are assumed constant , for simplicity .",
    "amplitude modulation is allowed to take place in an oblique direction , at an angle @xmath0 with respect to the carrier wave propagation direction .",
    "once an explicit criterion for the occurrence of instability is established , our aim is to trace the influence of @xmath0 on the conditions for the mi onset , and determine the magnitude of the associated instability growth rate .",
    "finally , we shall also examine the possibility of the formation of localized excitations and discuss their characteristics .",
    "exact new expressions are derived for all quantities of interest , in terms of the system s dispersion laws . among other physical parameters discussed , our formulation leaves open the choice of _ sign _ of dust charge ( @xmath1 ) ( most often taken to be negative since this is the most frequently occurring case @xcite ) and the dust pressure ( ` temperature ' ) scaling .",
    "our aim in doing so is to address , among others , the question of the influence of the dust charge _ sign _ on the amplitude modulation mechanism .",
    "we may also attempt to clarify the effect of taking ( or not ) into account the dust pressure evolution equation ( omitted e.g. in @xcite ) in the analysis .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "the analytical model is introduced . in section iii ,",
    "we carry out a perturbative analysis by introducing appropriate slow space and time evolution scales , and derive a nls - type equation which governs the ( slow ) amplitude evolution in time and space .",
    "the exact form of dispersion and nonlinearity coefficients in the nls - type equation is presented and discussed . in section iv",
    ", we carry out a stability analysis of the nlse allowing for a thorough study of the daw stability in various regions of the physical parameters involved .",
    "the analysis is pursued in section v , where we discuss the possibility of the existence of localized solutions of the nlse , and identify their forms in different parameter regions .",
    "finally , we briefly summarize our results in the concluding section .",
    "we consider a three component collisionless unmagnetized dusty plasma consisting of electrons ( mass @xmath2 , charge @xmath3 ) , ions ( mass @xmath4 , charge @xmath5 ) and heavy dust particulates ( mass @xmath6 , charge @xmath7 ) , henceforth denoted by @xmath8 respectively .",
    "dust mass and charge will be taken to be constant , for simplicity .",
    "note that both negative and positive dust charge cases are considered , distinguished by the charge sign @xmath9 in the formulae below .",
    "the basis of our study includes the moment - poisson system of equations for the dust particles and boltzmann distributed electrons and ions .",

    "the dust mean velocity @xmath12 obeys @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the electric potential . the dust pressure",
    "@xmath15 obeys @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the ratio of specific heats ( @xmath18 is the number of degrees of freedom ) e.g. @xmath19 in the adiabatic one - dimensional ( 1d ) case and @xmath20 in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) case .",
    "the system is closed with poisson s equation @xmath21 note that the right - hand - side cancels at equilibrium due to the overall neutrality condition @xmath22 the right - hand side in ( [ poisson ] ) is often formulated in terms of the ratio @xmath23 ; for convenience , we have @xmath24 due to ( [ neutrality ] ) , so that a value lower ( higher ) than @xmath25 corresponds to negative ( positive ) dust charge ; @xmath26 obviously tends to unity in the absence of dust ( in any case , @xmath27 ) .",
    "we will retain this notation in the following , for the sake of reference to previous works .",
    "the electrons and ions are assumed to be close to a maxwellian equilibrium .",
    "the corresponding densities are @xmath28 and @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the temperature of species @xmath31 ( @xmath32 is the boltzmann constant ) .",

    "finally , @xmath51 is equal to unity , given the above choice for @xmath52 ; nevertheless , @xmath53 - often interpreted as a temperature ratio via a different scaling , see e.g. @xcite - will be retained in order to ` tag ' the influence of the coupling to pressure evolution equation ( [ eqp ] ) being taken into account - as compared to a previous work @xcite where eq .",

    "therefore , the numerical result of the scaling in our ( daw ) case is completely different from the one in the dust ion - acoustic ( diaw ) case @xcite , despite the apparent similarity in the model expressions @xcite ; this is why we chose not to analyse the diaw case any further , in the same text .",

    "following the standard multiple scale ( reductive perturbation ) technique @xcite , we shall consider the following stretched ( slow ) space and time variables @xmath83 where @xmath84 , bearing dimensions of velocity , is to be later interpreted as the group velocity in the @xmath85 direction . in order to take into account the influence of an oblique amplitude modulation on the da wave",
    ", we will assume that all perturbed states depend on the fast scales via the phase @xmath86 only , while the slow scales enter the argument of the @xmath87th harmonic amplitude @xmath88 , which is allowed to vary along @xmath85 , @xmath89 the reality condition @xmath90 is met by all state variables .",
