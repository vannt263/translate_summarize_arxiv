    "sofic groups were introduced at the end of the last century by m.  gromov @xcite and b.  weiss @xcite .",
    "the class of groups they constitute is very large since it includes in particular all locally residually amenable groups and hence all linear groups . actually , the question whether or not every group is sofic remains open up to now although several experts in the field think that the answer to this question should be negative . roughly speaking , a group is sofic when it can be well approximated by finite symmetric groups .",
    "sofic groups satisfy certain finiteness properties that are important in the theory of dynamical systems and operator algebras .",
    "for example , it is known that every sofic group is surjunctive @xcite , hyperlinear @xcite , and has stably finite group algebras whatever the ground field @xcite . for an introduction to the theory of sofic groups ,",
    "the reader is referred to the excellent survey paper @xcite or to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 7 ) .",
    "the theme of soficity was fruitfully developed in several other directions : weakly - sofic groups @xcite , linearly sofic groups @xcite , @xcite , sofic groupoids of measure - preserving transformations @xcite , @xcite , and sofic measure - preserving equivalence relations @xcite . in each of these settings ,",
    "the basic question of the existence of a non - sofic object remains still unanswered .",
    "the goal of the present note is to investigate a notion of soficity for monoids , i.e. , sets equipped with a binary operation that is associative and admits an identity element . with our definition , a group is sofic as a monoid if and only if it is sofic as a group . as every submonoid of a sofic monoid is sofic , this implies that every monoid that can be embedded into a sofic group is itself sofic .",
    "consequently , all free monoids , all cancellative one - sided amenable monoids , are sofic .",
    "the class of sofic monoids is closed under direct products , projective limits and inductive limits .",
    "we shall also see that all finite monoids and all commutative monoids are sofic . as there exist finite monoids as well as commutative monoids that are not cancellative , this shows in particular that there are sofic monoids that can not be embedded into groups . on the other hand",
    ", we shall prove that the bicyclic monoid is non - sofic .",
    "thus there exist finitely presented amenable inverse monoids that are not sofic .",
    "finally , we shall present a graph theoretic characterization of soficity for finitely generated left - cancellative monoids in terms of approximability of their cayley graphs by finite labeled graphs .",
    "this characterization is analogous to the one used by weiss in @xcite for defining sofic groups .",
