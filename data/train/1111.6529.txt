    "recent interest in antiferromagnetism on the honeycomb lattice comes from many directions .",
    "first , theoretical studies of quantum spin models on the lattice find a rich phase diagram , with several colinear , spiral and spin - disordered phases.@xcite second , a recent quantum monte carlo finding that the hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice shows strong evidence for a quantum spin - liquid phase sandwiched between the semi - metal phase at small @xmath9 and an ordered antiferromagnetic phase at large @xmath9 , has led to much follow - up activity.@xcite third , the discovery of graphene and the search for correlated topological insulator phases have also led to interest in strongly correlated electron models on the honeycomb lattice , including spin - orbit coupling.@xcite    in this paper , our primary motivation comes from the bismuth manganese oxynitrate material bi@xmath1mn@xmath2o@xmath3no@xmath1 , an @xmath0 antiferromagnet , with a curie - weiss constant of order @xmath10 , which does not show any long range order down to @xmath11.@xcite the material consists of honeycomb lattices of @xmath0 @xmath12 spins which are separated by bismuth and nitrate layers .",
    "two such layers are separated by bismuth atoms , forming a bilayer , and these bilayers are then separated by significantly larger separations .",
    "thus an appropriate model for such a system is a spin-@xmath13 heisenberg model on the bilayer honeycomb lattice , with an in - plane nearest - neighbor exchange @xmath6 and an exchange between the bilayers of @xmath7.@xcite the bilayer exchange @xmath7 has been estimated by an electronic structure calculation to be between @xmath6 and @xmath14 , whereas further neighbor in - plane exchanges , which frustrate the system are down compared to @xmath6 by an order of magnitude ( less than @xmath15).@xcite this system has also been studied recently by quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations and bond - operator based mean - field and variational theory@xcite , which our results are compared to below .",

    "since the spin-@xmath13 material bi@xmath1mn@xmath2o@xmath3no@xmath1 is unlikely to have @xmath7 values an order of magnitude larger than in plane couplings , it is clear that frustration must be present to explain the absence of nel order . to study this",

    ", width=226 ]    at the classical level , a single layer heisenberg model loses nel order at @xmath56.@xcite this is indicated by @xmath57 in fig .  6 . however , this ratio is somewhat enhanced in the presence of quantum fluctuations . since , this enhancement in the critical @xmath32 is roughly @xmath58 for the @xmath4 case,@xcite it should be much smaller for the @xmath0 case .",
    "the critical @xmath32 should be further enhanced by the addition of a small @xmath7 in the bilayer , since a small bilayer coupling makes the system more ordered .",
    "thus , the phase diagram in the @xmath32 and @xmath17 plane has a slightly renetrant character for small @xmath17 .",
    "this has the effect that beyond @xmath59 , the phase boundary becomes close to vertical and our series analysis is no longer accurate to locate it precisely .",

    "if the material bi@xmath1mn@xmath2o@xmath3no@xmath1 has @xmath61 , then the singlet phase must arise from strong bilayer coupling and the material is almost certainly in the spin - disordered phase that is adiabatically related to the product singlet phase at large @xmath7 . in this phase",
    "our calculation of the excitation spectra should be accurate .",
    "neutron scattering on the material can help determine more precise exchange parameters .",

    "whether a new spin - liquid phases arises in the spin-@xmath13 model at small @xmath17 with frustration , and how far down in @xmath17 the product singlet phase continues remains an open question , which deserves further study . if there is a frustration dominated spin - liquid phase for @xmath0 at small @xmath7 values , and that is the appropriate phase for the material , that would make the material much more interesting . in this case ,",
