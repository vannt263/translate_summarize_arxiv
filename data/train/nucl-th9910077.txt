    "traditional shell - model calculations diagonalize a hamiltonian @xmath1 in a many - body basis ; the current best limit on model - space dimension is about @xmath2 @xcite although more typical spaces have basis dimensions of @xmath3-@xmath4 . rather than diagonalization , afmc shell model calculations employ the imaginary - time evolution operator @xmath5 to project out the ground state and evaluate thermally weighted expectation values . for the purposes of this paper",
    "is it sufficient to sketch the broad outlines of the method ; for a detailed description the interested reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "the nuclear hamiltonian @xmath1 is usually two - body and can be written as quadratic in one - body operators @xmath6 this is done in detail below .",
    "the quadratic term is source of all troubles ; in order to facilitate numerical computation it is linearized , via the hubbard - stratonovich transformation , to form an effective one - body hamiltonian that depends on the imaginary time @xmath7 : @xmath8 where @xmath9 if @xmath10 and @xmath11 if @xmath12 .",
    "then the imaginary - time evolution operator @xmath5 becomes a path - integral : @xmath13 \\exp \\left ( -{1\\over 2 } \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau   \\sum_\\alpha |v_\\alpha|^2 \\sigma_\\alpha(\\tau)^2 \\right )   \\left [ { \\cal t }   \\exp \\left ( - \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau\\hat{h}(\\tau ) \\right ) \\right ] , \\label{pathintegral}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 denotes time - ordering .",
    "this path integral can be evaluated by monte carlo sampling if a sufficiently well - behaved weight function @xmath15 can be found .",
    "an ideal weight function could be , for example , the trace of the integrand of eqn .",
    "( [ pathintegral ] ) itself .",
    "unfortunately this choice of @xmath15 often takes on both positive and negative values and one must use @xmath16 as a weight function . in those cases typically @xmath17 , and the statistical errors for the monte carlo value of the observable are overwhelmingly large .",
    "for afmc methods this is the manifestation of the sign problem .",
    "the shell model is built upon single - fermion states , using fermion creation and destruction operators @xmath18 . for a spherical basis",
    "these fermion states have good angular momentum @xmath19 and @xmath20 , as well as orbital angular momentum @xmath21 which dictates the parity @xmath22 . for each state",
    "we associate a `` time - reversed '' partner , @xmath19 and @xmath23 , and define a time - reversal operation by a bar : @xmath24 and @xmath25 . because of the half - spin statistics , @xmath26 .",
    "as hinted above , the time - reversal properties play a central role .",
    "the two - body hamiltonian is usually written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 , the @xmath29 are matrix elements of the interaction , and the two - body creation operator is @xmath30_{jt , mt_z}$ ] .",
    "peforming a pandya transformation from the particle - particle to the particle - hole representation , the hamiltonian becomes @xmath31 plus a residual one - body term that does not concern us here .",

    "proton and neutron densities are combined : @xmath33 note : we will refer to these densities as ` isoscalar ' ( @xmath34 ) and ` isovector ' ( @xmath35 ) even though the latter do not truly have good isospin .",

    "of course , only the antisymmetric matrix elements @xmath40 are physical and are used in eqn .",
    "( [ twobody ] ) ; the symmetric matrix elements @xmath41 , although unphysical , are a degree of freedom in the particle - hole representation and can be used to encourage convergence .    the next step is to diagonalize the @xmath42 , which has eigenvalues @xmath43 and eigenvectors @xmath44 .",
    "define @xmath45 ; then finally @xmath46 now the hamiltonian is in the form of a sum of manifestly quadratic operators and the hubbard - stratonovich transformation can be applied .",
    "in some systems @xmath47 is positive - definite and there is no sign problem .",
    "lang s theorem @xcite shows that for nuclear physics a wide class of systems are free from the sign problem .",
    "any one - body operator @xmath48 can be separated into time - even and time - odd parts : @xmath49 .",
    "the basic statement of lang s theorem is that , for even @xmath50 , even @xmath51 systems ( or @xmath52 odd ) , if the effective one - body hamiltonian ( [ effham ] ) is strictly time - even , then there is no sign problem ; specifically , that @xmath53 .",
    "since @xmath54 is also time - odd , this means that time - even operators @xmath55 must have a real coefficient and time - odd operators an imaginary coefficient . because imaginary coefficients only enter if @xmath12 , this means that time - even terms arise from attractive interactions and time - odd terms from repulsive interactions .",
    "one can easily show that @xmath56 , where @xmath57 parity of density operator @xmath58 .",
    "( the parity can only be negative when interactions cross major harmonic oscillator shells @xcite . for a @xmath59 model space , such as the @xmath60 or @xmath61 shells",
    ", the parity can be ignored . )",
    "hence the criterion for a ` good ' interaction is @xmath62    in order to deal with realistic interactions @xcite which modestly violate lang s rule , alhassid et al .",
    "@xcite introduced a method whereby one deforms the realistic interaction to one that conforms to lang s rule and then extrapolates from the `` good '' regime to the `` bad '' regime .",
    "that is , let @xmath63 where @xmath64 satisfies lang s rule and @xmath65 uniformly violates it .",
    "this is done by decomposing the interaction into the form ( [ diagonalform ] ) , and segregrating ` good ' from ` bad ' interactions via ( [ good ] ) .",
    "then one introduces @xmath66 where one usually takes @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "for @xmath68 we have the original hamiltonian , but for @xmath69 , @xmath70 satisfies lang s rule and is amenable to the monte carlo shell model .",
    "the typical procedure is to compute for several values of @xmath71 and then extrapolate to @xmath72 .",
    "the results agree for model spaces where exact diagonalizations can be performed for comparison @xcite .",
    "there are two points of conventional wisdom regarding monte carlo shell model calculations , both of which are noted in lang et al @xcite and later papers",
    "@xcite :    * conventional wisdom # 1 * : it is customary to set the unphysical @xmath73 to @xmath74 so that @xmath75 .",
    "this reduces the number of auxiliary fields to be integrated over . on the other hand ,",
    "it is conceivable that for some interactions one could exploit @xmath76 to avoid the sign problem at the modest cost of doubling the number of auxiliary fields .",
    "this paper proves explicitly that the latter statement is impossible and that the conventional choice is indeed the best , not only with regards to reducing the dimensions of the integral but with regard to alleviating the sign problem .    *",
    "conventional wisdom # 2*. the extrapolation procedure amounts to increasing the strength of the pairing interaction",
    "@xcite notes that an attractive pairing interaction , with @xmath77 yields @xmath78 for all @xmath79 ; if added crudely in sufficient strength to any interaction it will make it ` good . '",
    "empirically one finds that the more general extrapolation procedure described above seems to increase the pairing strength @xcite .",
    "the sum rules given below show explicitly a relation between the sign problem and the pairing interaction .",
    "this is the central section of the entire paper .",
    "the sum rule is , for isoscalar densities ( @xmath34 ) is @xmath80 and for isovector densities(@xmath35 ) @xmath81    the proof of these sum rules is straightforward . for a given @xmath79 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , since the sum of the eigenvalues is just the trace of the matrix .",

    "\\label{sum2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( for each of these steps parity must be conserved so that implicitly @xmath86 in equations ( [ sum1 ] ) , ( [ sum2 ] ) . )",
    "the final step is to note that , due to their symmetry properties , @xmath87 must be symmetric for @xmath88 and antisymmetric for @xmath89 .",
    "hence the terms @xmath90 , @xmath91 vanish and @xmath92 reduces to @xmath93 . thus the final results follow easily .    now to interpret these sum rules .",
    "recall that lang s rule dictates that a ` good ' interaction will have @xmath94 . by inspecting the ` isovector ' sum rule ,",
    "if any @xmath95 is ` good ' ( and nonzero ) there must be another , nonzero ` bad ' @xmath96 to cancel its contribution . the only option to avoid the sign problem in the isovector channel",
    "is to set all @xmath97 , thus confirming conventional wisdom # 1 .",
    "the isoscalar sum rule is expressed in terms of the @xmath0 pairing matrix elements .",
    "first consider ` normal parity ' pairing matrix elements , that is , within a major oscillator shell . if @xmath98 , then the contribution of the ` bad ' @xmath96 s will switch signs and increase the magnitude of the isoscalar sum rule .",
    "this must then manifest as stronger , more attractive pairing matrix elements , as expounded in conventional wisdom # 2 .",
    "the ` abnormal parity ' pairing matrix elements , which takes a @xmath0 pair of nucleons from one oscillator shell to one of opposite parity , must however become more repulsive .",
    "such behavior is illustrated in figure 1 for a realistic cross - shell interaction @xcite .",
    "there we plot the @xmath0 matrix elements @xmath99 , grouped by shells , denoting the @xmath60-shell by @xmath100 and @xmath61-shell by @xmath101 .",
    "the case @xmath68 ( filled circles ) correspond to matrix elements from the original , realistic interaction that has a ` bad ' sign , while @xmath102 ( open circles ) correspond to an interaction minimally deformed to have a ` good ' sign .",
    "as described by the isoscalar sum rule , the intershell ( @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) pairing becomes more attractive as @xmath105 , while the intrashell ( @xmath106 ) becomes more repulsive .",
    "matrix elements of the type @xmath107 do not exhibit any significant trend , which is accord with the sum rules : such matrix elements do not contribute to the trace over the @xmath108 .    in summary ,",
    "the two sum rules derived herein allow one to confirm the conventional wisdom regarding afmc computations .",
    "they also potentially yield a powerful tool to analyze the extrapolation and to look for alternatives .",
