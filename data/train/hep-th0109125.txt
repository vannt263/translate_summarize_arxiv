    "term were also considered in @xcite and the related underlying geometry was called h - poisson or twisted poisson one . ]",
    "several correlation functions of the string theory are obtained in the @xmath12 limit and it was concluded that the algebra of functions on the d - brane worldvolume is non - associative and noncommutative .",
    "various correlation functions are expressed in terms of a non - associative product @xmath13 . in @xcite",
    "the commutation relations of the coordinate @xmath14 of the end point of the open string were studied by using the approximation of a very short and slowly moving string .",
    "it was found that the commutators of the coordinate @xmath14 contain a momentum @xmath3 and it was argued that the space on which the d - brane lives is not the usual noncommutative space which we are getting used to . in @xcite a new product @xmath15 was defined in order to make the product @xmath13 associative on the functions of @xmath14 and @xmath3 and an attempt to define a gauge transformation in this ` @xmath14-@xmath3 space ' was presented .",
    "an explicit construction of the gauge theory action , however , was not obtained yet .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to understand how the low energy effective theory can be formulated as an associative and noncommutative gauge theory , when the background space is curved and the field strength @xmath1 along the direction of the d - brane worldvolume is nonvanishing .",
    "our analysis will be restricted to the bosonic string .",
    "we assume that the field strength is weak and perform analysis in perturbation series in @xmath11 up to @xmath16 .",

    "the result is striking .",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 do not commute with each other in contrast to the @xmath5 case .",
    "this means that when we take the @xmath12 limit , the gauge and scalar degrees of freedom at both ends of the string are not decoupled in the low energy effective theory .",
    "we are forced to take into account the degrees of freedom at both ends in constructing the field theory description and the numbers of gauge and scalar fields are doubled .",
    "furthermore the noncommutative product @xmath2 constructed according to the algebra of @xmath14 and @xmath22 is _ associative _ , but operates on both coordinates.(sec 3 ) we are thus lead to consider a bi - local field theory .",
    "all fields are functions of @xmath14 and @xmath22 .",
    "the gauge theory must be formulated in the 2@xmath6 dimensional @xmath23 space instead of the ordinary @xmath6 dimensional @xmath14 space .",
    "this bi - local field theory will , however , be acausal and must be regarded as an intermediate step toward construction of the local effective field theory , which will be discussed later",
    ".    construction of this bi - local gauge theory can be performed in a standard way .",
    "the derivatives are generalized in such a way that they satisfy leibnitz rule with respect to the product @xmath2.(sec 4 ) the commutator of the gauge covariant derivatives defined in terms of these new derivatives gives the gauge field strength.(sec 5 ) the trace or the integral is defined in such a way that the cyclic property is respected .",
    "an obstruction in this prescription is the curved d - brane worldvolume .",
    "the metric of the effective gauge theory is the open string metric@xcite , which is curved already at @xmath24@xcite .",
    "because the gauge symmetry of the noncommutative gauge theory is realized by differential operators on the fields , if the action contains such a non - constant metric , one anticipates that the gauge symmetry may be broken .",
    "remarkably , we found that there exists a coordinate transformation in the @xmath25 space ( not in the @xmath17 space ) which effectively makes @xmath5 .",
    "in other words in a suitably chosen frame @xmath26 the coordinates satisfy the commutation relations of the @xmath5 theory .",
    "therefore it is natural to further assume that the metric is flat in this frame .",
    "moreover the derivatives with respect to @xmath27 and @xmath28 coincide with the new derivatives defined above to satisfy leibnitz rule . by writing down the action for the noncommutative gauge theory with @xmath29 in the flat @xmath30 frame and by going to the @xmath23 frame by means of the inverse coordinate transformation",
    ", we obtain the action for a bi - local , noncommutative gauge theory in curved backgrounds .    as mentioned above",
    ", the above bi - local theory is non - local and will be acausal .",
    "next we will present a prescription to reduce our bi - local theory to a ` local theory'.(sec 6 ) actually , in order to obtain a massless string we must consider a limit @xmath31 .",
    "this is not automatically achieved in the @xmath12 limit .",
    "we will set @xmath32 by hand in the integrand of the effective action and integrate this over @xmath14 with a suitable weight function @xmath33 .",
    "we will show cyclic property of this reduced effective action which relates various correlation functions of the fields at @xmath14 and @xmath22 , _ i.e. _ , at both ends of the string .",
    "this reduced effective action is still invariant under a part of the gauge transformation .",
    "we propose this as the low energy effective action of the open string in the @xmath34 background .",
    "this reduced effective action , however , contains @xmath2 in the integrand and the manipulation such as differentiation with respect to @xmath14 and/or @xmath22 must be performed before setting @xmath32 . in this sense",
    "this reduced effective action is not the ordinary action in the @xmath14 space .",
    "finally in sec 7 we will speculate on the relation of our noncommutative gauge theory to the matrix model in curved backgrounds .",

    "<S> we point out that when a d - brane is placed in an ns - ns @xmath0 field background with non - vanishing field strength ( @xmath1 ) along the d - brane worldvolume , the coordinate of one end of the open string does not commute with that of the other in the low energy limit . </S>",
    "<S> the degrees of the freedom associated with both ends are not decoupled and accordingly , the effective action must be quite different from that of the ordinary noncommutative gauge theory for a constant @xmath0 background . </S>",
    "<S> we construct an associative and noncommutative product @xmath2 which operates on the coordinates of both ends of the string and propose a new type of noncommutative gauge action for the low energy effective theory of a d@xmath3-brane . this effective theory is bi - local and lives in twice as large dimensions ( @xmath4 ) as in the @xmath5 case . when viewed as a theory in the @xmath6-dimensional space , this theory is non - local and we must force the two ends of the string to coincide . </S>",
    "<S> we will then propose a prescription for reducing this bi - local effective action to that in @xmath6 dimensions and obtaining a local effective action .    </S>",
