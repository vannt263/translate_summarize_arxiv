    "the processes are distinguished by how they affect the superposition of the probing particle in the interferometer .",
    "a systematic investigation of these phenomena thus calls for a quantitative understanding of mixed state superposition , which the present investigation may facilitate . to complement the class of induced superposition measures we consider measures that have a direct operational interpretation in terms of interference experiments .    lately",

    "to obtain the simplest possible illustration of the idea of superposition measures , consider a two - dimensional hilbert space spanned by the two orthonormal vectors @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "assume that we consider states @xmath2 for which @xmath3 , i.e. , the probability to find the system in either of the two states is @xmath4 .",
    "all such density operators can be written @xmath5 where the complex number @xmath6 satisfies @xmath7 . hence , @xmath6 is the off - diagonal element when @xmath2 is represented in the @xmath8 basis . in one extreme , @xmath9 ,",
    "the state is in a pure equal superposition between the two states . in the other extreme , @xmath10 ,",
    "the state is maximally mixed and there is no superposition .",
    "we can conclude that the off - diagonal element @xmath6 describes the superposition , and it seems intuitively reasonable to take the quantity @xmath11 as a measure of  how much \" superposition there is between the two states @xmath12 and @xmath0 .",
    "this observation generalizes to pairs of orthogonal subspaces , in the sense that the off - diagonal block carries the information concerning the superposition . in sec .  [ unit ]",
    "we consider superposition measures based directly on this observation , while in the following we focus on the analogy with , and relation to , entanglement measures .    given a finite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath13 we consider a collection of @xmath14 at least one - dimensional subspaces @xmath15 such that @xmath16 , i.e. , we consider a collection of pairwise orthogonal subspaces that spans the entire hilbert space .",
    "when we say that @xmath17 is a decomposition of @xmath13 we assume the above mentioned properties .",
    "we let @xmath18 denote the projector corresponding to subspace @xmath19 , and define the channel @xmath20 we write @xmath21 when we want to stress that @xmath22 is defined with respect to the decomposition @xmath17 .",
    "the effect of @xmath22 is to remove all the  off - diagonal blocks \" @xmath23 from the density operator , leaving the  diagonal blocks \" @xmath24 intact .",
    "superposition measures @xmath25 are real - valued functions on the set of density operators on @xmath13 , and are defined with respect to some decomposition @xmath17 . to clarify with respect to which decomposition the measure",
    "is defined we write @xmath26 .",
    "the following provides a list of properties that a superposition measure may satisfy .",
    "note that we do not claim these properties to be  necessary conditions \" for superposition measures , they are merely convenient and reasonable conditions that the measures we consider here do satisfy . for",

    "since such a block - diagonal state has no superposition between the subspaces in question , c2 thus seems a reasonable condition .",

    "property c3 states that @xmath25 is invariant under unitary transformations on the subspaces in the decomposition . from an intuitive point of view",
    "this seems reasonable since such unitary operations do not change the  magnitude \" ( e.g. , some norm ) of the off - diagonal operators , and thus should not change the  amount \" of superposition .",
    "this condition is analogous to the invariance of entanglement measures under local unitary operations .",
    "the last property , c4 , states that the degree of superposition does not increase under convex combinations of states ( as is the case for , e.g. , @xmath11 , as defined above ) .",

    "the master equation does not distinguish the path states , which we may interpret as the environment being insensitive to the path state of the atom . that there is",
    "no path information stored in the environment seems consistent with the nonvanishing superposition . in the case of local relaxation",
    ", however , local environments distinguish the paths and should reasonably cause decay of the superposition , as we indeed see is the case in fig .",
    "[ fig : relax ] .",
    "in the third case , with @xmath539 , some of the dotted curves in fig .",
    "( [ fig : relax ] ) do increase beyond their initial value .",
    "it follows ( by the results in sec .",
    "[ chno ] ) that the intermediate case ( corresponding to @xmath539 ) can not be lsp and thus represents a nonlocal relaxation . to summarize these examples , it appears as if the ky - fan norm measures to some extent reflect the locality or nonlocality of the relaxation process .",
    "one might wonder to what extent the nonlocal decay model is realistic . if the internal degree of freedom is a nuclear spin in an external magnetic field , and we assume that the system relaxates via spontaneous emission , the small energy splitting results in a long wavelength of the emitted photons .",
    "moreover , these states have a very long life time in general , which suggests a significant coherence length of the emitted radiation .",
    "if both these length scales are much larger than the separation of the two paths one might speculate that the decay process does not ",
    "notice \" the path difference , and thus be nonlocal in the above sense .",
    "( there may , however , be other decoherence mechanisms that cause localization . ) along these lines one could consider experiments in order to test to what degree , and on what length scales , different relaxation mechanisms of various excited internal degrees of freedom do localize an atom .    in the above discussions we have interpreted the two paths of the interferometer as two spatial modes .",

    "we introduce the concept of superposition measures with respect to given orthogonal decompositions of the hilbert space of a quantum system , which can be regarded as an analogue to entanglement measures with respect to decompositions into subsystems . by a second quantization of the system",
    ", superposition can be regarded as entanglement , and thus makes it possible to construct superposition measures using entanglement measures .",
    "we find the superposition measures induced by relative entropy of entanglement and of entanglement of formation , and obtain a decomposition formula of the relative entropy of entanglement for certain classes of states .",
    "we furthermore consider a class of superposition measures based on unitarily invariant operator norms . especially we consider measures derived from ky - fan norms , and show that these can be obtained operationally using interferometric techniques .",
    "we show that the ky - fan norm based measures are bounded by predictability , similarly as for the standard visibility in interferometry @xcite .",
    "we furthermore consider the superposition measures under the action of subspace preserving and local subspace preserving channels @xcite , and show that these channels can not increase the superposition with respect to certain superposition measures .",
    "we illustrate the theory with models of an atom undergoing relaxation while propagating in a mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "we consider  local \" and  nonlocal \" relaxation models , and monitor this difference by the evolution of the superposition measures .",
    "one could consider to extend the ideas presented here by defining a  superposition cost \" by inducing it from the entanglement cost @xcite .",
    "similarly , one can induce a  distillable superposition \" from distillable entanglement @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to find formulations of these induced superposition measures directly in terms of the subspace decompositions of @xmath13 , similarly as done here for the relative entropy of superposition and superposition of formation , rather than via the indirect definition using the second quantization .",
    "the quantitative approach to superposition introduced here may facilitate the development of interferometry as a probing technique of processes in physical systems @xcite .",
    "especially , one could consider to use the superposition measures to systematically construct interferometric channel measures in the spirit of refs .",

    "@xcite quantifies how sensitive the outcomes of measurements in the computational basis are to phase changes of input superpositions to a quantum process .",
    "it does not seem unreasonable that there exist relations between this interference measure and the change of superposition caused by the channel .",
    "such a comparison would benefit from a generalization of the measure put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite to the general type of subspace decompositions considered here .",
