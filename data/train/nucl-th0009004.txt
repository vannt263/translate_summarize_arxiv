    "relativistic heavy - ion collisions at sufficiently high energies offer the unique opportunity to probe highly excited dense nuclear matter under controlled laboratory conditions .",
    "the ultimate objective @xcite of the field of relativistic heavy - ion physics is to produce , detect , and study the properties of the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , a new state of matter characterized by a transition to a phase of deconfined quarks and gluons .",
    "the fundamental confining property of the quantum chromodynamic ( qcd ) vacuum means that the deconfined state of a qgp is not directly observable .",
    "what is observable are hadronic and leptonic residues produced from the transient qgp state . in order to connect the properties of a qgp with experimental data from real nuclear collisions , theoretical models of these very complex ,",
    "non - equilibrium collisions are needed .",
    "it is important that a variety of models be developed as no single model can hope to be complete in its ability to describe the system ; each will have its strengths and limitations .",
    "we here develop and present results from the dynamical string - parton ( dsp ) model , a model which has as one of its strengths the detailed description of the interaction in time , from the initial state of two colliding nuclei through until the freeze - out of all the produced final - state particles .",
    "the string - parton model@xcite is a fully dynamical but classical string picture of hadrons and their collisions .",
    "the model incorporates both confinement and asymptotic freedom . in this model ,",
    "the classical equations of motion for covariant strings determines the motion of hadronic matter according to the lagrangian proposed by nambu and got @xcite .",
    "the string is viewed as a gluon field with massless quarks attached at its endpoints .",
    "mesons have a quark at one end and an antiquark at the other , while baryons have a diquark at one end and a quark at the other .",
    "colliding strings interact via quark and gluon interactions .",
    "a covariant and causal hadronization mechanism for the strings is included in the form of a dynamic , probabilistic , and invariant scheme for the decay of excited strings @xcite .",
    "the distinction of this model from others is the inclusion of both real - time dynamical string evolution as well as the inclusion of quark and gluon scattering as the sole source of the hadronic interactions .",
    "the model is minimalist and completely dynamic .",
    "once the parameters of the string breaking and the quark and gluon interactions are fixed , collisions are studied by evolving the string equations of motion in three  space and one  time dimensions .",
    "the model produces quite well the average properties of a broad scope of reactions , including @xmath0 , hadron - hadron @xcite , lepton - nucleus @xcite , and nucleus - nucleus collisions@xcite .",
    "the string - parton model is different in some essential ways from models based on the ideas of the classical string that use collision generator concepts , the ( lund  @xcite , fritiof  @xcite , rqmd  @xcite , and qgsm  @xcite ) models .",
    "the strings in the dsp model are not longitudinal ; they are evolved according to the dynamics of the underlying lagrangian . in comparison to other approaches , the string parton model is also quite minimalist .",
    "fragmentation in most models is a process that involves a variety of terms each with its own flavor - dependent parameters .",
    "the decay scheme developed here is much simpler and flavor independent ; flavor enters through the quantization @xcite of the final - state hadronic masses .",
    "the differences between the models are motivated by the intended applications of the model .",
    "since the dsp model describes reactions by calculating explicitly the time evolution of the participant strings , we are limited in the complexity of the fragmentation model that we are able to employ . in the dsp model , the few parameters needed to describe fragmentation are determined from @xmath0 reactions @xcite .",
    "quark - quark , quark - gluon , and gluon - gluon interactions are introduced and adjusted to fit the basic features of @xmath1@xmath2 collisions . at the @xmath1@xmath3 and nucleus - nucleus level",
    ", the model is completely predictive .    in the next section ,",
    "we review the original model and some already published refinements that we have made to that model . in the original model ,",
    "all mesons were treated as one generic meson of mass about 240 mev .",
    "the model was not capable of addressing data in which the final state mesons were specifically identified .",
    "a technique has been developed to quantize the masses of the mesons @xcite .",
    "this together with a review of how the string configurations which make up the nucleon are determined from the experimentally measured structure function @xcite is presented in section ii . in section",
    "iii the model is further developed by 1 ) extending the model of the nucleon to include gluonic strings , thus incorporating the experimentally measured gluonic content of the nucleon into the model , and 2 ) extending the quark - quark , quark - gluon , and gluon - gluon interactions to contain both a hard process taken from perturbative qcd and a soft process that is determined phenomenologically . also in section iii , we determine some of the limited number of parameters in the model from @xmath0 data . in section iv , we examine @xmath1@xmath2 collisions where we find further constraints on the parameters and demonstrate the ability of the model to describe hadron - hadron collisions . in section",
    "v we present the first results for @xmath1@xmath3 collisions of the new model , and in section vi give the first results for @xmath3@xmath3 collisions .",
    "finally we summarize what we have learned from the model and provide thoughts on future work , both applications and possible improvements and generalizations .",
    "in this section we review the model and several enhancements to the model  these include a new analytic method @xcite for determining the distribution of string solutions that make up a nucleon directly from the experimentally measured structure function and the method @xcite for quantizing the masses of the mesons .",
    "these have been published elsewhere .",
    "the first results for hadronic collisions which employ these enhancements are presented here in sections iii , iv , and v.    the classical nambu - got lagrangian @xcite provides a covariant description of the motion of a classical string with massless endpoints .",
    "the lagrangian is defined as proportional to the invariant area swept out by the string , @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are parametric variables that determine the location of the point @xmath7 , where @xmath7 is a point which lies on the area swept out by the string .",
    "the usual continuum mechanics algebra produces the equations of motion for the string .",
    "the proportionality constant @xmath8 is a parameter of the model and has units of energy / length .",
    "it is called the string constant and determines the scale at which the space - time evolution occurs .",
    "it is a parameter of the model .",
    "lattice gauge calculations @xcite produce the linear potential between quarks implied by this lagrangian . for strings with total momentum zero ,",
    "the solutions to the lagrangian are characterized by a closed trajectory . for each trajectory , the endpoints of the string travel around the closed trajectory at the speed of light .",
    "the location of the string connecting the endpoints follows from the equations of motion . to obtain strings with non - zero momenta , the stationary strings are simply boosted relative to their rest frame .    for each trajectory , the endpoints of the string carry a finite and well determined fraction of the energy and momentum of the string .",
    "we identify these endpoints as quarks @xcite .",
    "as the endpoints move at the speed of light , they represent massless quarks . for mesons ,",
    "the endpoints are taken to be a quark and anti - quark ; for nucleons , the endpoints are identified with a quark and a di - quark .",
    "the electromagnetic structure function provides an experimental measure of the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath9 carried by the quarks , with @xmath9 defined by @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) are the energy and @xmath15-component of the quark s ( whole string s ) momentum . for any string trajectory ,",
    "the momentum fraction carried by the quarks can be calculated by averaging over the orientation of the string and over both one complete period of motion , and finally taking the limit to the infinite momentum frame .",
    "each trajectory thus implies a particular result for the structure function . turning this around",
    ", we use the experimentally measured structure function of a hadron to determine a distribution of trajectories that will reproduce the experimentally measured results .",
    "this concept of utilizing a distribution of trajectories of classical strings to model the structure function is used here and has also been applied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite this concept was pushed one step further .",
    "there it was shown that the structure function can be analytically related to the distribution of straight line segments making up the trajectories , assuming that trajectories are polygons made up of straight line segments .",
    "the results of these calculations demonstrate that the nucleon can be modeled as strings with a large number of straight line segments  a significant fraction of the distribution is for strings with greater than ten segments .",
    "the nucleon has no probability @xcite of being a one - segment or one - dimensional solution . in this one - segment solution ,",
    "the quarks oscillate back and forth along a straight line , a solution which is called the _ yo - yo_. the structure function for the yo - yo solution can be calculated analytically @xcite .",
    "the yo - yo is the only shape which contributes in the limit @xmath16 .",
    "for this solution , and this solution only , the probability of one quark carrying all the momentum goes to zero linearly in @xmath17 .",
    "for the three - quark nucleon it is not surprising that this solution is absent .",
    "for the two - quark pion , however , there is a finite probability for the pion to be a yo - yo , or nearly so .",
    "many models , however , are based on or are motivated by the yo - yo solution to the classical string model .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite provides a means for initializing the proton as a distribution of strings with the correct parton momentum distribution .",
    "the analytical results are supplemented by a prescription which randomly attaches the calculated distribution of straight line segments to form closed trajectories .",
    "this collection of strings then forms the nucleon . a moving nucleon results from boosting the collection of strings from the rest frame .",
    "this provides the needed model of an incident nucleon , and , by distributing nucleons according to their experimentally measured spatial and momentum distribution in a nucleus , a model of an incident nucleus .",
    "note that the model of the nucleon / nucleus is completely determined by experimental data other than the hadronic reactions which are to be studied .",
    "we must also supplement the dynamics by interactions and decays .",
    "a model of the hadronization process is necessary if we are to model high - energy nuclear processes .",
    "the hadronization process is believed to take place via soft non - perturbative mechanisms .",
    "the dsp model assumes that an excited and therefore stretching color flux - tube breaks via the creation of a @xmath18 pair with the color field of the new pair equal and opposite that found in the parent string .",
    "a covariant description @xcite results from assuming that the probability of a string breaking is proportional to the invariant area , @xmath19 , swept out by the string , @xmath20 the proportionality constant @xmath21 is a parameter to be determined from experimental data .",
    "it determines the rate at which strings break and thus will be intimately related to the multiplicity of a reaction as well as other experimentally measurable quantities .",
    "this decay law is invariant because it is defined in terms of an invariant area , and it is causal as the breaking occurs at a single point on the string .",
    "the probability that a string which is present at time @xmath22 will survive until time @xmath23 is then the exponential @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "hadronization is then treated stochastically .",
    "aa a string evolves in time , it decays according to the probability given by eq .",
    "( [ eprob ] ) .",
    "if a string is to decay , it breaks at a point chosen randomly along its length .",
    "we have examined the possibility of calculating the tension locally along the string and then having the string break at each point according to the tension at that point .",
    "we found that this possible refinement had no significant impact on experimentally measurable quantities , so we do not utilize it .",
    "much of the qualitative features of hadronization are contained in this simple model :    * the intuitive picture of a string breaking more often the more it is stretched is built in .",
    "the more highly excited the string , the more likely it will break since the string sweeps through more invariant area .",
    "* the uniform distribution of pions and the rapidity plateau emerge naturally . * the leading particle effect results from having those particles created in the central region arising from quark - quark interactions that produce highly excited strings which fragment first .",
    "string pieces arising from the primary quarks are less excited and fragment last .",
    "this model presents a problem that is completely analogous to a problem with the classical bohr model of the atom . in the bohr model",
    ", the electron would continue to radiate until it spiraled into the nucleus . here",
    ", a string would continue to decay until it became an infinite number of very small pieces each with very little energy . in the original dsp model @xcite",
    ", a generic meson mass was introduced .",
    "meson strings were allowed to decay if they had sufficient energy to make two of these generic mesons . otherwise , the string could not decay and was identified as a generic meson . for baryonic strings , strings with masses greater than the nucleon mass plus the generic meson mass were permitted to decay ; the rest would be identified with the nucleon .",
    "this scheme is very limiting .",
    "it allowed the model to address questions of mass flow , momentum flow , and multiplicity , but could not address meson identification , as is common for contemporary experimental data .",
    "the model was generalized @xcite by quantizing the mass of the classical strings .",
    "this is done by creating mass windows , energy regions that extend from the physical meson mass , @xmath26 , to the physical mass plus a small increment , @xmath27 .",
    "if the mass of a string created in a hadronization process lands within one of these windows , the point at which the string decays is adjusted a small amount to produce a section of string with a mass equal to the physical meson mass .",
    "once a string is identified with a meson , it is no longer allowed to decay .",
    "thus the mass of a string in the final state is quantized to be the mass of a physical meson ( within the small width that results from the numerical discretization of the string ) .",
    "strings with a mass larger than the heaviest meson ( we take a cutoff of 1 gev ) are always allowed to decay , as are strings with masses that fall between the mass windows .",
    "phase space arguments were provided that predict the width of each window @xmath27 .",
    "these results were found @xcite to be in qualitative agreement with results that were obtained from fitting to meson multiplicities measured in @xmath0 experiments , as will be described in more detail in the next section .",
    "a striking experimental feature of both the @xmath28 hadrons reaction and the @xmath29 hadrons reaction is that the mean transverse momentum is always roughly @xmath30 gev / c .",
    "this leads to the assumption that the production of low transverse momentum ( @xmath31 gev / c ) in these experiments is due primarily to the fragmentation of the gluon field that binds the quarks .",
    "this can be modeled by giving the quarks created in a string breaking equal and opposite non - vanishing transverse momenta .",
    "although the transverse cross - section comprises a small part of the total cross - section , it is of significant importance in relativistic heavy - ion collisions since it can be used as a measure of the _ stopping _ experienced by the nuclei @xcite .",
    "various models of @xmath32 pair production @xcite predict a gaussian transverse momentum distribution during the string breaking , but this falls far short of the experimentally measured distributions .",
    "extensions of such models to infinitely long , uniform color - electric flux - tubes with finite transverse size may be a remedy @xcite . in the absence of any fundamental calculations",
    ", we chose to parameterize the transverse momentum acquired by the created quarks with a simple exponential distribution function @xmath33 the average experimental transverse momentum is approximately related to @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ ptd ] ) by @xmath35 .",
    "this is not an analytically exact relationship as the transverse direction to the string is not , particularly after a number of quark collisions , the same as the transverse direction in the reaction plane and because the high - momentum tail in eq .",
    "( [ ptd ] ) can not occur as these momenta would violate conservation of energy - momentum .",
    "the final ingredient needed to be able to model hadronic collisions is a model of the hadron - hadron interaction . in this work ,",
    "we further refine the model of the hadronic interactions .",
    "this new model is developed in section iv .",
    "we also modify the model of the nucleon so as to include the experimentally determined gluonic content of the nucleon into the model .",
    "this development is also given in section iv .",
    "preliminary results which contained some of these new elements developed here can be found in refs .  @xcite .",
    "in this section we describe our model of the hadronization process and how the parameters which control the process are determined from @xmath0 data .",
    "the simulation of an @xmath0 collision begins at the @xmath18 vertex where a quark and anti - quark are created with oppositely directed momenta and move apart , stretching the string between them .",
    "the parameters that relate to the quark and gluon interactions are to be determined from @xmath1@xmath2 collisions which will be presented in the next section .",
    "however , we will also show here that the quark and gluon interactions play an important role in @xmath0 dynamics .",
    "this physics had been neglected in the previous version of the dsp model .",
    "the determination of the parameters of the model no longer separates into first using @xmath0 data to determine the hadronization parameters and then using @xmath1@xmath2 interactions to determine the interaction parameters . instead",
    ", the best interaction parameters must be used while determining the hadronization parameters , and vice versa .",
    "the first parameter is the string constant @xmath8 that sets the energy scale of the model . the regge model of highly excited hadrons @xcite pictures these states as rotational states built on individual excited states .",
    "the string model also provides a picture of excited states arising from rotating strings and gives the linear trajectories found in the regge model .",
    "the slope of these trajectories is the string tension and is found experimentally @xcite to be @xmath36 0.88 gev / fm .",
    "we will utilize this value ; thus this parameter is determined completely external to our model .",

    "however , we have also discovered a new phenomena , the dynamics of the @xmath0 reaction are also affected by the quark and gluon interactions . in the next section we will describe , in detail , our model of these interactions .",
    "here , we will demonstrate their effect on the @xmath0 theoretical results . to do this",
    ", we present calculations which utilize the best - fit parameters for the interactions from the next section to compare with results in which we neglect these interactions completely . in fig .",

    "the average multiplicity is not changed by the rescattering ; the peaks of the two curves are at the same value of the multiplicity",
    ". however , the rescattering broadens the curve and moves it much closer to the data .",

    "we have found this peak to be a persistent feature in all calculations which do not include this additional rescattering .",
    "similarly , the rescattering naturally enhances the fractional longitudinal momentum distribution near @xmath44 , as is needed in the data .    by looking at the parameters and assumptions of our model",
    ", we can understand why this additional scattering must be included . upon breaking ,",
    "the newly created endpoints of the string do _ not _ satisfy the energy - momentum relationship of an on - shell massless particle .",
    "they are virtual and have a mass deficit .",
    "these quarks proceed along the string absorbing the energy in the string until they have gained sufficient energy to come on the mass shell . in our model ,",
    "the created quarks are assigned a longitudinal momentum equal to the created transverse momentum .",
    "this assignment is chosen as this will allow the quark to come on to the mass shell as quickly as possible .",
    "we have examined other assignments of longitudinal momentum during the string breaking , but the data seems to prefer this original choice .",
    "a part of our model is not to allow the quarks to interact until they are on - shell .",
    "this is motivated by the view that these interactions are mediated by gluonic exchanges .",

    "this is roughly equal to the interaction radius @xmath48 for the quarks or gluons to interact .",
    "thus one would expect a significant fraction of the created quark pairs to interact with each other after their creation .",
    "another way of viewing this is that the assignment of a transverse momentum ( and an accompanying longitudinal momentum ) at the string breaking is , itself , a model of the interaction of the created quark pairs .",

    "these are given in tables [ table1 ] and [ table5 ] .",
    "the model is completely predictive at the @xmath1@xmath3 and @xmath3@xmath3 level .",
    "we present here the first calculations of the extended model . for @xmath0 and @xmath1@xmath2 collisions",
    "we find excellent results .",
    "this is partially because we adjust our parameters to fit this data .",
    "however , we find that over the energy range we examined , the limited number of energy - independent parameters used does reproduce well a broad range of data .",
    "we then calculate results for @xmath1@xmath3 and @xmath3@xmath3 collisions at cern energies . on the whole",
    ", the results are quite satisfactory .",
    "the predictions generally lie within the experimental error bars with a few points lying just outside the error bars , as would be expected .",
    "we see perhaps more stopping in the data than is produced by the dsp model and an indication of additional transverse momentum production in the @xmath56 collision .",
    "there is considerable work to be done with the model .",
    "the model can predict the energy dependence of distributions measured in @xmath3@xmath3 collisions .",
    "predictions of these quantities up to and including rhic energies are possible",
    ". a comparison with the data that will soon be coming forth from rhic will provide insight into the dynamics of these complex collisions .",
    "we have calculated only several measured distributions .",
    "there are a number of other quantities which are both measurable and are calculable by the dsp model .",
    "we expect that the model will need further refinement as more detailed properties of the reaction are confronted .",
    "finally , a distinct advantage of the model is that it is dynamic ; the reaction is generated as a function of time on the computer .",
    "this allows us to track in detail the time evolution of important aspects of the reaction , such as the central energy density or the flow of energy or matter .",
    "understanding the time evolution of the reaction can provide great insight on the origin of the asymptotic properties that are to be experimentally measured .",
    "the ultimate goal of relativistic heavy - ion research is to discover and investigate the quark gluon plasma .",
    "this will to a great extent be an exercise in understanding the differences between model predictions and data .",
    "it is thus very important to constrain the models . in the dsp model ,",
    "the constraints come from @xmath0 , @xmath1@xmath2 , and @xmath1@xmath3 data .",
    "there exists a limited amount of data for the @xmath1@xmath2 and @xmath1@xmath3 reactions and this data has reasonably large errors .",
