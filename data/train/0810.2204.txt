    "f. j. yndurin , `` paco '' for his friends , was very dear for this qcd96-qcd08 conference series , since , apart from an active participant , he was member of the advisory committee in all editions . for the present qcd08 , he was to review our work , but , very unfortunately , he passed away just before the beginning of the conference .",
    "we thank prof .",
    "s. narison for offering us the chance to give the same talk together with a brief account of prof .",
    "yndurin outstanding scientific career .    in the university of zaragoza , spain , paco obtained his master degree in mathematics in 1962 and defended in 1964 his phd thesis in physics , `` definitions of hamiltonians and renormalization '' , supervised by a. galindo . in zaragoza he also held an assistant professorship ( 1964/66 ) , before moving to new york university as a fulbright fellow ( 1966/67 ) and associate researcher ( 1967/68 ) .",
    "he then became research fellow at cern ( 1968/70 ) , an institution to which he was specially attached , being senior scientific associate in 1976 and 1985 , and elected member of the scientific policy committee from 1988 to 1994 .",
    "finally , after a short period in the complutense university of madrid in 1970 , he became full professor in the autnoma univesity of madrid , where he had a decisive influence in shaping one of the best theoretical physics departments and particle physics groups in spain .",
    "actually , he was director of the department twice ( 1974/77 - 1981/84 ) , dean of the science faculty in 1975 and research vice - rector ( 1978/81 ) .",
    "paco s intense activity was rewarded with many friends and collaborations all over the world , becoming visiting researcher at cern , michigan , marseille , nikhef , brookhaven , orsay , saclay , viena , la plata , bogot , caracas ... he was also founding member of the european physical society , invited member of the american association for the advancement of science , the new york academy of science and both the mathematical and physics spanish royal societies . in addition , he became elected member of the european board of high energy physics of the european physical society ( 1983/89 ) , and elected president of the physics and chemistry section of the spanish royal academy in 2002 .",
    "but his influence extended beyond physics as scientific advisor of ibm ( 1983/85 ) , of the institute for scientific research of kuwait in ( 1980/82 ) , and as elected member , by the spanish senate , of the spanish university council , as well as elected member of the world innovation foundation in london ( 2001 ) and the _",
    "academia europaea_.    paco was awarded the gold medal of the spanish royal academy and was an honorific collaborator of ictp in trieste , la plata university , and cavaliere ufficiale",
    "nellordine al merito della reppublica italiana , a country very dear for him .",
    "paco authored or coauthored more than 160 publications , including articles and talks . unfortunately in this space",
    "we can only highlight a few . in his new york period",
    "he was interested in analyticity methods for scattering theory , that he gathered in a review of modern physics in 1972 @xcite . around that time ,",
    "qcd , the subject of this conference series , was established as the theory of strong interactions .",
    "this is where paco obtained his most celebrated results , like the calculations of structure functions in the 70 s and 80 s @xcite , the hadronic contributions to the muon g-2 in the 80 s and 00 s @xcite , quarkonium calculations in the 90 s @xcite , as well as light quark and chiral symmetry qcd calculations in the early 80 s @xcite",
    ".    the participants in this qcd08 conference might be more familiar with his qcd work , but he also made other well known contributions to the standard model phenomenology , like the calculation of radiative corrections to @xmath1 scattering @xcite .",
    "he also made some well known phenomenology beyond the standard model @xcite but always limited within his very cautious and critical attitude towards standard model extensions .    in recent years ,",
    "motivated by the very recent and precise experimental results , he was looking back to some of his initial interests , about analytic properties of pion - pion scattering amplitudes @xcite , the subject of this talk .",
    "paco dedicated an enormous effort and enthusiasm to communicate physics and science .",
    "of special relevance for the participants in this qcd conference is his famous book  a classic ",
    "`` qcd : an introduction to the theory of quarks and gluons '' ( springer - verlag 1983 ) . for many of us in the young",
    " well , maybe not so young  generations of particle physicists , paco s book has been the book where to learn qcd .",
    "he kept improving it throughout four different editions ( from the second it is entitled `` the theory of quark and gluon interactions '' ) .",
    "more recently he also wrote a book on `` relativistic quantum mechanics : and introduction to field theory '' ( springer - verlag 1996 ) , and another one on `` mecnica cuntica '' ( in spanish , 2nd ed .",
    "ariel s.a .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "less known to the international community  they are written in spanish are his books on popular science and `` speculation '' , as he called them , whose translated titles are : `` unified theories and the constituents of matter '' , `` who walks out there '' , `` electrons neutrinos and quarks '' and `` the challenges of science '' .",
    "anyone called `` francisco '' in spain can also be called `` paco '' .",
    "the reason is that st .",
    "francesco de assisi  san francisco in spanish , was the founder of franciscan monastic community and so he was the `` father of the community '' or _",
    "`` pater comunalis '' _ in latin .",
    "abbreviated : _ pa.co . _",
    "but in the case of f.j .",
    "yndurin , `` paco '' was much more than just a nickname . in dire times for spanish scientific research , he was able to produce first level results and was able to gather a research group on particle and theoretical physics that later on became the theoretical physics department of the autnoma university in madrid , extending his influence and scientific attitude much beyond .",
    "with his career and example he really became one of the _ `` pater comunalis '' _ of the spanish particle physics community .",
    "paco , we will miss you as a friend , but also your enthusiastic and contagious vitality not only about physics but life as a whole .",
    "_ sit tibi terra levis _  may the earth rest lightly on you .    of course",
    ", knowing paco , i guess that by now he would be highly embarrassed and yelling from the back ... enough is enough ! let s have fun with physics ! ! ... ",
    "let s not make him wait any longer .",
    "a precise determination of the @xmath0 scattering amplitude at low energies is relevant for the study of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) , quark masses , the chiral condensate @xcite and , at intermediate energies , for the properties of the controversial sigma meson .",
    "however , the existing experimental information from @xmath0 scattering has many conflicting data sets at intermediate energies and for many years very little data in the low energy region close to threshold .",
    "the interest in the topic has been renewed with recent @xcite and precise experiments on kaon decays , relatively easy to relate to @xmath0 scattering .    from the theoretical side ,",
    "this process is very special due to the strong constraints from isospin , crossing and chiral symmetries , but mostly from analyticity .",
    "the latter allows for a very rigorous dispersive integral formalism that relates the @xmath0 amplitude at any energy with an integral over the whole energy range , increasing the precision and providing information on the amplitude even at energies where data are poor , or in the complex plane .",
    "remarkably , it is model independent since it makes the data parametrization irrelevant once it is included in the integral .",
    "the dispersive approach is thus well suited to study the threshold region or poles in the complex plane associated to resonances .",
    "our recent works @xcite make use of two complementary dispersive approaches , in brief :    @xmath2 _ forward dispersion relations ( fdrs ) : _ calculated at @xmath3 so that the amplitude unknown large - t behavior is not needed .",
    "there are two symmetric and one asymmetric isospin combinations , to cover the isospin basis .",
    "the symmetric ones , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , have two subtractions @xmath6 where @xmath7 stands for the @xmath8 or @xmath9 amplitudes .",
    "they are very precise since all the integrand contributions are positive .",
    "the antisymmetric isospin combination @xmath10 reads @xmath11 all fdrs are calculated up to @xmath12  mev    @xmath2 _ twice subtracted roy equations ( re ) : _ they are an infinite set of coupled equations @xcite , equivalent to nonforward dispersion relations plus some @xmath13 crossing symmetry .",
    "they are well suited to study poles of resonances since they are written in terms of partial waves @xmath14 of definite isospin i and angular momentum @xmath15 .",
    "the complicated left cut contribution is rewritten as a series of integrals over the physical region : @xmath16 where the @xmath17 , @xmath18 constants and @xmath19 kernels are known .",
    "the calculation is truncated at @xmath20 and at some cutoff energy @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath22 waves and the high energy are input . although re are valid for @xmath23mev , for now we have implemented them only up to @xmath24 .",
    "the aim of our group when using re combined with fdr has been to improve the precision of scattering data analysis , to test chpt , and , still in progress , to obtain precise determinations of the @xmath25 resonance .",
    "the bern group @xcite has also carried out a series of re analysis , with and without chpt constraints , using as input phenomenological parametrizations for the @xmath22 waves and above 800 mev for the other waves , as well as some regge input . when using chpt constraints , they find , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , an extremely precise claim , together with predictions for other scattering lengths and the s and p wave phase shifts up to 800 mev .",
    "although of the original input , particularly the regge theory and the d waves , was questionable @xcite , it certainly seems to have a very small influence in the threshold region of the scalar waves @xcite . in addition",
    ", the krakow - paris @xcite and paris @xcite groups have performed other re analysis .",
    "the former resolved a long - standing ambiguity , discarding the so - called `` up'' solution , including in their analysis a study using polarized target data .",
    "the latter checked the calculation in @xcite and claimed an small discrepancy in the olsson sum rule .",
    "the approach we have followed over a series of works @xcite can be sketched as follows :    \\(1 ) we obtain simple  unconstrained fits to data  ( ufd ) to each @xmath0 scattering wave so that it can be improved independently if needed .",
    "high energy fits use regge theory .",
    "as our precision improves , we refine our fits with more flexible parametrizations or with new and more precise data , as , for example , in @xcite where we included the newest and very precise @xmath28 data @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) we then check how well these ufd satisfy fdrs and re and some sum rules . to our surprise some of the most widely used data parametrizations fail to satisfy fdrs or the sum rules .",
    "thus we choose the data parametrizations in better agreement with fdrs .",
    "\\(3 ) our best results are obtained by imposing dispersion relations ( both fdrs and re ) and some crossing sum rules ( sr ) on the data fits , now called `` constrained fits to data '' ( cfd ) , which are thus consistent with analyticity , unitarity , crossing , etc ...    a dispersion relation @xmath29 is well satisfied at a point @xmath30 if the difference @xmath31 between the left and right sides in eqs.([fdr1]),([fdr2 ] ) and ( [ roy ] ) is small relative to its uncertainty @xmath32 .",
    "thus , when the average discrepancy ( similar to an averaged @xmath33 ) @xmath34 it implies that the corresponding dispersion relation is satisfied within uncertainties . in practice",
    ", the values of @xmath30 are taken at intervals of 25 mev .",
    "this measure is also used @xcite to obtain the constrained fit to data , by minimizing : @xmath35 where @xmath36 are all the parameters of the different ufd parametrization for each wave or regge trajectory , thus ensuring the data description , and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the discrepancies for a couple of crossing sum rules .",
    "the weight @xmath39 was estimated from the typical number of degrees of freedom needed to describe the shape of the amplitude .",
    "the result of this program is , on the one hand , a set of precise constrained fits to data , that satisfy very well all dispersion relations within uncertainties .",
    "remarkably , all the waves are given in terms of very simple parametrizations that can be found in @xcite which are very easy to use for phenomenological purposes .",
    "on the other hand , we have the outcome of roy eqs . themselves that allows us to extend the calculation to the complex plane and look for poles associated to resonances and study their parameters .",
    "in particular the best determination of threshold parameters is obtained by using the cfd set directly or inside appropriate sum rules @xcite . for the s0 and s2 waves ,",
    "we find : @xmath40 and @xmath41 , in remarkable agreement with the predictions in @xcite , that extends also to the @xmath42 wave scattering length .",
    "there are however , some disagreements of 2 to 3 standard deviations in the p - wave slope , and also in some @xmath43 wave parameters . in general , for the controversial s0 wave , the agreement is fairly good only up to roughly 450 mev , but from that energy up to 800 mev those predictions deviate slightly from our data analysis .",
    "this means that we find from our roy eqs . and fdr data analysis a somewhat different pole from that of the bern group ( see r. kaminski talk in this conference ) .",
    "let us emphasize that we are talking about a deviation of a few degrees that only affects the sigma mass and width determination by ten or twenty mev at most , which is a remarkable improvement compared with the situation just a few years ago and the huge and extremely conservative uncertainties of hundreds of mev quoted in the pdg at present @xcite .",
    "in this conference we report preliminary results on two issues : first , we have recently implemented once - subtracted roy eqs , ( denoted gkpy for brevity)@xcite .",
    "this is motivated by the interest in the @xmath44 region of the s0 wave , dominated by the @xmath25-resonance .",
    "the large low - energy experimental uncertainties in the s2-wave translate into large uncertainties for the dispersive output for the s0 wave in that region when using the standard twice subtracted roy eqs .",
    "( shaded area in top panel of fig 1 ) , but not for the once subtracted ones , which have a much smaller uncertainty ( fig 1 , bottom ) .",
    "figure 1 . above 500 mev , the uncertainty in standard s0 roy eqs .",
    "( top ) is much larger than with once subtracted roy eqs .",
    "( bottom ) .",
    "second , we have improved the matching between the s0 wave parametrizations at low and intermediate energies , which occurs at 932 mev , imposing also continuity in the first derivative .",
    "this follows a suggestion @xcite to explain the roughly @xmath45 level discrepancies in the s0 wave between our analysis and that of the bern group in the @xmath46mev region . in fig.2",
    "we compare the cfd in @xcite ( dashed line ) and the new one with the improved matching ( continuous line ) , which only differ a little above 932 mev .",
    "note that , for clarity , we do not provide data points , which are nevertheless reasonably well described by both parametrizations when taking into account experimental errors .",
    "hence , the disagreement is _ not caused _ by a poor matching , but we are studying further suggestions in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless this better matching improves the roy and gkpy eqs .",
    "fulfillment above 850 mev , as seen by comparing the bottom panels in figs.1 and 2 .",
    "top : the improved matching only changes slightly the s0 wave above 932 mev .",
    "bottom : the agreement gkpy eqs .",
    "is slightly improved above 850 mev ( compare with fig.1 bottom ) .",
    "finally , in order to show how well our preliminary cfd set satisfies the nine dispersion relations , we list in table 1 the average discrepancies , defined in eq.([avdiscrep ] ) , for the three fdr , up to two different energies , and for the three roy eqs .",
    "up to @xmath47 , either with the standard two subtractions or only with one . from that table",
    "it is clear that this cfd set satisfies remarkably well all dispersion relations within uncertainties    in summary the cfd set provides a model independent and very precise description of the @xmath0 scattering data consistent with analyticity and crossing that can be easily used for phenomenological purposes .",
    "work is in progress to obtain an even more accurate description for threshold parameters than the one we had , and ( see r. kaminski talk ) by using it inside once - subtracted roy eqs .",
    ", to obtain a precise determination from data of the @xmath25 pole parameters .",
