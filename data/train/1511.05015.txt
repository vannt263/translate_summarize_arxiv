    "the so - called figure of merit @xmath0 , which describes how efficiently a material can produce thermoelectric power , is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the electric conductivity , @xmath3 is the seebeck coefficient , @xmath4 is the temperature and @xmath5 is the thermal conductivity .",
    "besides electrons , phonons are the dominant carriers for thermal conductivity .",
    "because the thermal conductivity due to electrons is closely linked to the electric conductivity via the wiedemann - franz law , the decrease of phononic thermal conductivity is one handle to improve the efficiency of thermoelectric devices .",
    "structuring materials is one possibility to influence the phononic thermal conductivity .",
    "the basic structuring element is an interface , which acts like a filter for the impinging phonons .",
    "phonons on one side of the interface will be partially reflected by the interface and partially transmitted across the interface . in certain frequency regions ,",
    "one of the materials may not support propagating phonons , which completely blocks out the corresponding phonon current . by alternating soft and hard materials , for example",
    ", the thermal resistance can be increased above the mean resistance of both materials .",
    "the thermal resistance of an interface , called kapitza resistance@xcite , produces a finite temperature step across the interface in the presence of a thermal current .",
    "more complex structures involve several interfaces .",
    "multiple reflections between these interfaces enhance or suppress the thermal current due to constructive or destructive interference respectively .",
    "these effects depend crucially on the relative phases of individual phonons .",
    "furthermore , the local behavior in structures with small spatial dimensions differs from the near - equilibrium description employed on macroscopic length scales .",
    "this work addresses the transport of phonons across single and multiple interfaces .",
    "the tools developed can , however , be extended to the transport of other quasiparticles across single or multiple interfaces .",
    "the description accounts for evanescent waves , which mediate phonon tunneling through thin layers of a material , and which can also transport heat across the interface , if additional scattering processes convert the energy into propagating modes .",
    "evanescent waves can combine to form true interface states , that exist only in the proximity of the interface .",
    "the methods preserve the phase information , which allows the study of interference effects at multiple interfaces .",
    "the focus on the propagating and evanescent waves as the elementary entities sets this method apart from the atomistic green s function method@xcite , an elegant and widely used method for phonon transport problems .",
    "the relation between the atomistic green s function method and our mode - based method is analogous to that of greens - function based and wave - function based approaches in electronic structure theory .",
    "while each method has its own virtues , they can be transformed into each other .",
    "for example , the mode coupling coefficients can be extracted from the greens function@xcite .",
    "the advantage of the green s function method over the present method is the ease with which ensemble averages , for example over scatterers , are performed .",
    "the mode matching described here , in contrast , makes the contact to the individual modes more direct .",
    "the present method also differs from many previous approaches @xcite in that it first evaluates the complex band structure , where it exploits the full symmetry of the bulk materials .",
    "these waves are then matched at an interface , which has a reduced symmetry .    in the remainder of this section ,",
    "we briefly review the theoretical basis of thermal transport via phonons in the incoherent and the coherent limits .",
