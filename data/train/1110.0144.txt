    "in high - power accelerators , the stored beam energy can be large : about 2  mj in the tevatron , and several hundred megajoules in the lhc at nominal energies and intensities .",
    "uncontrolled losses of even a small fraction of particles can damage components , cause magnets to lose superconductivity , and increase experimental backgrounds . contributing to these losses",
    "is the beam halo , continuously replenished by beam - gas and intrabeam scattering , ground motion , electrical noise in the accelerating cavities , resonances and , in the case of colliders , beam - beam forces .",

    "the affected particles have increasing oscillation amplitudes and a large fraction of them is captured by the secondary collimators .",

    "the classic multi - stage system does have limitiations : a fraction of particles is always lost around the ring ( leakage ) ; collimator jaws have an electromagnetic impedance ( wakefields ) ; and high losses are generated during collimator setup when the jaws are moved inward .",
    "another problem is beam jitter .",
    "the orbit of the circulating beam oscillates due ground motion and other vibrations .",
    "even with active orbit stabilization , the beam centroid can oscillate by tens of microns .",
    "this translates into periodic bursts of losses at aperture restrictions .",
    "bent crystals and the hollow electron beam collimator are two advanced techniques to address these limitations in complementary ways . channeling and volume reflection in bent crystals reduce leakage by directing halo particles deeper into the absorbers in a single pass  @xcite .",

    "a 15-mm - diameter hollow electron gun was designed and built ( figure  [ fig : egun ] ) .",

    "the gun was installed in one of the tevatron electron lenses ( tel2 ) , located in the a  sector of the ring .",
    "experiments were done with antiprotons because of their smaller size and because of the configuration of the tevatron collimation system .",

    "stainless - steel secondaries were placed at the f48 and d17 locations in the ring .    in the electron lens , protons and antiprotons",
    "were separated transversely and in time .",

    "the radius of the hole was controlled by the ratio of solenoid fields .",
    "three corrector coils were used to align the electron beam with the circulating beam . thanks to the special high - voltage modulator",

    "experiments in the tevatron started in october  2010 and ended with the shutdown of the machine in september  2011",
    ". many observables such as particle removal rates , effects on the core , diffusion enhancement , collimation efficiency and loss rate fluctuations were measured as a function of electron lens parameters : beam current , relative alignment , hole radius , pulsing pattern , and collimator configuration .",
    "preliminary results were presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . here , a few examples of the main effects are shown .",
    "the first question we addressed was the particle removal rate .",
    "can these small transverse kicks have a detectable effect ?",
    "the experiment in figure  [ fig : scraping ] ( left ) shows the scraping effect .",
    "the electron lens was aligned and synchronized with the second antiproton bunch train , and then turned on and off several times at the end of a collider store .",
    "the electron beam current was about 0.4  a and the radius of the hole was varied between 6 and 3.5 standard deviations ( @xmath5 ) of the vertical beam size .",
    "the black trace is the electron - lens current . to isolate the effect of the hollow beam , figure  [ fig : scraping ] ( left ) shows the ratio between the intensity of the affected train and the average intensity of the other two control trains .",
    "one can clearly see the smooth scraping effect .",
    "the corresponding removal rates are a few percent per hour , and increase with decreasing hole radii .",
    "one can also see that there were no adverse effects with large hole sizes .",
    "this allowed us to do many experiments parasitically during regular collider stores .",
    "which particles are being removed ?",
    "whether there are any adverse effects on the core of the circulating beam is a concern .",
    "the overlap region is not a perfect hollow cylinder , due to asymmetries in gun emission , to evolution under space charge of the hollow profile , and to the bends in the transport system .",
    "we estimated the effects on the core from several points of view : particle removal rates , emittance growth , luminosity , and diffusion enhancement vs.  amplitude .",
    "first , one can see from figure  [ fig : scraping ] ( left ) that no decrease in intensity was observed with large hole sizes , when the hollow beam was shadowed by the primary collimators .",
    "this implies that the circulating beam was not significantly affected by the hollow electron beam surrounding it , and that the effect on beam intensity of residual fields near the axis was negligible .",
    "secondly , one can observe the evolution of the emittances . in figure",
    "[ fig : scraping ] ( right ) , the average emittances of the affected bunch train are shown .",
    "if there was emittance growth produced by the electron beam , it was much smaller than that driven by the other two main factors , intrabeam scattering and beam - beam interactions",
    ". as expected , for small hole sizes , suppression of the beam tails translated into a reduction in measured transverse emittances .",
    "the effect of halo removal can also be observed by comparing beam scraping with the corresponding decrease in luminosity .",
    "luminosity is proportional to the product of antiproton and proton populations , and inversely proportional to the overlap area .",
    "if antiprotons were removed uniformly and the other factors were left unchanged , luminosity would decrease by the same relative amount .",
    "if the hollow beam caused emittance growth or proton loss , luminosity would decrease even more .",
    "because of the smaller relative contribution to luminosity of halo particles , a smaller relative change in luminosity is a clear indication of halo scraping . in figure",
    "[ fig : scraping ] ( left ) , one can see how the luminosity for the affected bunch train changed with time relative to the average luminosity of the control bunch trains .",
    "the dark cyan trace is the ratio between affected and control trains .",
    "the corresponding relative luminosity decay rates are smaller that those of intensity .",
    "as expected , luminosity decay rates approach intensity decay rates as the radius of the hole is decreased .",
    "it is possible to measure transverse beam diffusion rates as a function of betatron amplitude by observing the time evolution of losses as collimators are moved in small steps  @xcite ( figure  [ fig : cscan ] , top  left ) .",
    "the main features of the response of local losses to small inward collimator steps are a sharp peak and a decay proportional to the inverse square root of time . from this decay the diffusion rate at the location of the collimator can be extracted .",
    "figure  [ fig : cscan ] ( top right ) shows an example of a collimator scan .",
    "the vertical f48 secondary collimator was moved in 50-@xmath6 m steps towards the beam center .",
    "all other collimators were retracted .",
    "the characteristic decay time is a function of collimator position .",
    "these loss spikes are what constrained the tightest collimator settings and limited their setup .",
    "even when the collimators were moved in micron - size steps , below about 4@xmath5 in transverse beam size these spikes could exceed the quench limits in the tevatron superconducting magnets .",
    "figure  [ fig : cscan ] ( bottom left ) shows an example of diffusion measurements vs.  amplitude at the end of a regular collider store .",
    "similar to the results obtained in the hera machine at desy  @xcite , a strong dependence of the diffusion coefficient with amplitude is observed .",
    "more details can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we are interested in how the hollow beam affects diffusion .",
    "new scintillator paddles were installed near one of the antiproton secondary collimators during a short shutdown in march  2011 .",
    "these loss monitors were gated to individual bunch trains . with this device we could measure diffusion rates , collimation efficiencies and loss spikes simultaneously for the affected and the control bunch trains .",
    "an example of what can be observed by comparing losses from different bunches is shown in figure  [ fig : cscan ] ( bottom right ) .",
    "the electron lens was aligned and synchronized with bunch train  # 2 with a peak current of 0.9  a. the plot shows the response of local losses to an outward collimator step . in this case",
    ", one observes a dip instead of a spike .",
    "the difference in diffusion times between the control and the affected train is apparent .",
    "it corresponds to an enhancement of the diffusion rate by a factor  10 . because the steady - state loss rate is the product of diffusion coefficient and gradient of the beam population",
    ", the fact that it is only 10% higher for the affected train indicates that the halo population was reduced by approximately a factor  10 as well .      in figure",
    "[ fig : cscan ] ( bottom right ) , one may notice some of the periodic losses due to beam jitter in the control train .",
    "they are suppressed in the affected train : another indication of halo removal .",
    "this effect is also apparent in the fourier spectrum of gated losses ( figure  [ fig : jitter ] , left ) . normally , the spectra showed peaks corresponding to mechanical vibrations caused , for instance , by the main injector acceleration ramp ( 0.3  hz ) or by the compressors of the central helium liquefier ( 4.6  hz ) .",
    "the electron beam acting on the second bunch train suppressed these periodic losses .",
    "this is another manifestation of the reduction of tails .",
    "a better understanding of the distribution of these losses comes from the analysis of their correlations .",
    "the blue points in figure  [ fig : jitter ] ( right ) show the losses coming from train  # 3 vs.  those from train  # 1 .",
    "these are the two control bunches .",
    "one can see random fluctuations of the order of 2  khz out of 0.2  mhz .",
    "but the main effect is a very high correlation .",
    "most of the fluctuations are not random , but coherent .",
    "they can be attributed to beam jitter .",
    "the effect of the hollow beam is to eliminate this correlation : average losses are increased , instantaneous losses are randomized , and the spikes are reduced .",
    "this effect can be interpreted as an increase in diffusion and a decrease in tail population , which translates into a reduced sensitivity to beam jitter .",
    "thanks to the dedication of all the people involved in the project , the hollow electron beam collimator now appears to be a viable tool for high - power circular accelerators .",
    "many experimental observations of the scraping effects were made at the tevatron using the existing electron lenses equipped with a hollow electron gun designed for this purpose .    a new 25-mm gun was designed and built .",
    "it will be tested at the fermilab electron - lens test stand to investigate the technical feasibility of larger currents ( about 3  a at 5  kv ) and beam radii .",
    "we also plan to increase our effort in simulations to understand hollow - beam collimation in the tevatron and extend it to other machines .",
    "some of the electron lens hardware will become available after the tevatron shutdown .",
    "recently , both the doe larp review committee  @xcite and the lhc collimation review  committee  @xcite recommended continuing the experimental program at cern in the sps or in the lhc . in collaboration with the lhc collimation working group , we are studying whether a hollow - beam scraper is applicable to the cern machines .",
    "this project would not have been possible without the support of the fermilab accelerator division and of the cdf and dzero collaborations . in particular",
