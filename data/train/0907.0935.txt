    "recent neutrino oscillation experiments have provided us with very convincing evidence that neutrinos are indeed massive and lepton flavors do mix @xcite .",
    "this great discovery implies that the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particle physics is actually incomplete . in order to accommodate tiny neutrino masses ,",
    "one can naturally extend the sm by introducing three right - handed neutrinos , which are singlets under the @xmath7 gauge group . in this case",
    ", the gauge invariance allows right - handed singlet neutrinos to have a majorana mass @xmath8 , whose scale is not subject to the gauge symmetry breaking and then can be much larger than the electroweak scale @xmath9 , e.g. @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , the effective mass matrix for three known light neutrinos is given by @xmath11 in the leading - order approximation , with @xmath12 being the dirac neutrino mass matrix and @xmath13 .",
    "the smallness of neutrino masses can then be ascribed to the largeness of heavy majorana neutrino masses .",
    "this is the so - called canonical seesaw mechanism @xcite , which offers an elegant way to explain the tiny neutrino masses .",
    "however , the canonical seesaw model faces two serious difficulties .",
    "first , heavy majorana neutrinos are too heavy and their interactions are too weak for them to be generated in collider experiments , especially in the forthcoming cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) . thus the canonical seesaw model may lose the experimental testability .",
    "second , the ultrahigh energy scale characterized by the masses of right - handed neutrinos will cause the seesaw hierarchy problem unless @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "one way out of these tight corners is just to lower the seesaw scale down to tev , but make the charged - current interactions of heavy majorana neutrinos sizable . this possibility can be realized if and only if the structural cancellation condition @xmath15 is fulfilled @xcite . the clear signatures of heavy majorana neutrinos at the lhc are then the same - sign diplepton events @xmath16 ( for @xmath6 ) @xcite . apart from heavy majorana neutrinos , the tiny neutrino masses can be attributed to the higgs triplet @xmath17 , which couples to two lepton doublets and acquires a small vacuum expectation value @xmath18 @xcite . in this case , the mass matrix of light neutrinos is given by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the triplet yukawa coupling matrix .",
    "the more general case is the type-(i+ii ) seesaw model , in which both heavy majorana neutrinos and the higgs triplet are present and equally contribute to light neutrino masses .",
    "consequently , we obtain @xmath21 .",
    "the interplay between the terms @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the conventional type-(i+ii ) seesaw model has been discussed in ref .",
    "different from the canonical seesaw model , the experimental testability of heavy majorana neutrinos is preserved in this scenario if the global cancellation condition @xmath24 is satisfied @xcite . under this condition , both heavy majorana neutrinos and the doubly - charged component of the higgs triplet can be tested at the lhc via the lepton - number - violating ( lnv ) processes @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a novel type-(i+ii ) seesaw model , in which the contributions from heavy majorana neutrinos to light neutrino masses are vanishing @xmath25 .",
    "thus the mass matrix of three known neutrinos is @xmath3 , which is the same as in the pure type - ii seesaw model @xcite .",
    "however , the apparent difference of our scenario is that the neutrino mixing matrix becomes non - unitary .",
    "furthermore , the heavy majorana neutrinos can be discovered at the lhc as in the testable canonical seesaw model .",
    "recently , the collider signals of three heavy majorana neutrinos have been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite in the type - i seesaw model , which extends the previous works about only one heavy majorana neutrino case @xcite .",
    "another purpose of the present work is to consider the collider signatures of more than one heavy majorana neutrinos in a realistic type-(i+ii ) seesaw model .",
    "the remaining part of our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we propose an interesting type-(i+ii ) model with only two heavy majorana neutrinos , in which the structural cancellation condition @xmath15 is achieved by imposing an @xmath26 flavor symmetry . as a result of this elegant symmetry ,",
    "the nearly tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing can be obtained .",
    "section iii is devoted to calculating the cross sections of the processes @xmath27 , where @xmath28 ( for @xmath5 ) are the heavy majorana neutrinos .",
    "the interference effects of different heavy majorana neutrinos are emphasized , and the possible way to distinguish between the same - sign dilepon signals from heavy majorana neutrinos and the doubly - charged higgs bosons is briefly discussed .",
    "furthermore , the background from the sm have been taken into account , and the kinematic cuts are imposed to efficiently select the signal events . finally , we give some concluding remarks in section iv .",
    "in order to generate tiny neutrino masses , we can extend the sm by introducing three right - handed neutrinos and a triplet scalar .",
    "the gauge - invariant lagrangian relevant for lepton masses can be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are respectively the lepton and higgs doublets , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the right - handed charged - lepton and neutrino singlets , @xmath17 is the triplet scalar in the @xmath34 matrix form . after the spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking , the lepton mass terms turn out to be @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the majorana and dirac neutrino mass terms with @xmath38 and @xmath39 being the vacuum expectation values of the doublet and triplet scalars , respectively . @xmath40 and @xmath8 are the charged - lepton and heavy right - handed majorana neutrino mass matrices",
    ". the total @xmath41 neutrino mass matrix can be diagonalized by the following unitary transformation @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the mass eigenvalues of light and heavy majorana neutrinos , respectively . in the leading - order approximation ,",
    "the effective neutrino mass matrix is determined by the seesaw formula @xmath45 thus the smallness of light neutrino masses are attributed to the heaviness of right - handed neutrinos and the smallness of @xmath46 .",
    "it is obvious that the above equation reduces to the canonical seesaw formula @xmath47 , if the triplet scalar is absent . in the basis where the mass eigenstates of charged leptons coincide with their flavor eigenstates ,",
    "the leptonic charged - current interactions can be expressed as @xmath48 w^-_\\mu + { \\rm h.c . } \\ ; , %      ( 5)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( for @xmath51 ) stand for the mass eigenstates of three light and heavy majorana neutrinos , respectively .",
    "it is the charged - current interactions that govern both the production and detection of heavy majorana neutrinos in the hadron collider experiments . from eq .",
    "( 5 ) and the unitarity condition @xmath52 , we can see that the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath53 is non - unitary .",
    "therefore , both the detection of heavy majorana neutrinos and leptonic unitarity violation are determined by the couplings @xmath54 ( for @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) , which represent distinct interaction strengths of heavy majorana neutrinos with charged leptons . in the conventional type-(i+ii ) seesaw model , both terms on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 4 ) are comparable in magnitude and on the same order of the masses of three light neutrinos . in this case , the masses of heavy degrees of freedom are expected to be around the scale of grand unified theories , i.e. @xmath57 , so the conventional seesaw models can not be tested experimentally . in order",
    "that the heavy majorana neutrinos can be produced and detected at the lhc , one should appeal to the following scenarios :    * _ scenario a _ with @xmath58 and @xmath59 , but @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "this is similar to the canonical seesaw model , where the structural cancellation condition @xmath62 is required to render heavy majorana neutrinos testable @xcite . *",
    "_ scenario b _ with @xmath63 , but @xmath64 .",
    "this implies that the significant but incomplete global cancellation exists between @xmath22 and @xmath65 @xcite . in this case , the collider signals at the lhc induced by heavy majorana neutrinos and the doubly - charged component of the triplet scalar are correlated with each other @xcite . *",
    "_ scenario c _ with @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the latter condition is consistent with the structural cancellation condition @xmath68 , so both heavy majorana neutrinos and the triplet scalar can be discovered at the lhc .",
    "this interesting scenario has also been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite in a very different context .",
    "it has been observed that _",
    "scenario b _ may suffer from the problem of radiative instability and then serious fine - tunings @xcite .",
    "this drawback can be avoided in _ scenario c _",
    ", if the heavy majorana neutrinos are nearly degenerate in mass @xcite .    in the following",
    ", we shall concentrate on _ scenario c _ and propose an interesting model with several additional scalar fields and two heavy majorana neutrinos , which may serve as a straightforward extension of the minimal type-(i+ii ) seesaw model @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that our discussions can easily be made applicable to the case with three heavy majorana neutrinos , however , only two of them are sufficient for our purpose @xcite . to realize _ scenario c _ , we impose the @xmath69 flavor symmetry on the generic lagrangian of the type-(i+ii ) seesaw model .",
    "the assignments of relevant lepton and scalar fields with respect to the symmetry group @xmath70 are summarized as follows @xmath71 where three scalar doublets @xmath72 ( for @xmath56 ) , four scalar triplets @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( for @xmath56 ) , and one scalar singlet @xmath75 have been introduced .",
    "the gauge- and @xmath76-invariant lagrangian responsible for lepton masses turns out to be @xmath77 given the irreducible representations and multiplication rules of the @xmath78 group in @xcite , one can immediately verify the @xmath79-invariance of @xmath80 .",
    "after the spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking , the mass matrix of charged leptons is @xmath81 and the neutrino mass matrices are @xmath82 where the vacuum expectation values are taken to be @xmath83 ( for @xmath56 ) , @xmath84 ( for @xmath56 ) , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , while @xmath87 is the cubic root of @xmath88 . provided the textures of @xmath12 and @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( 9 ) , we can see that @xmath89 holds exactly . as a consequence ,",
    "the non - zero neutrino masses mainly arises from the type - ii seesaw mechanism @xmath90 . as implied by eq .",
    "( 8) with the assumption that @xmath91 , the charged - lepton mass matrix can be written as @xmath92 , which is simply diagonalized by the unitary matrix @xmath93 therefore , the masses of charged leptons are identified as @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 . setting @xmath97 and @xmath98 , we can obtain the neutrino mass matrix @xmath99 which can be diagonalized by the @xmath100-rotation in the @xmath101-@xmath102 plane , namely @xmath103 the mass eigenvalues of three known neutrinos are then given by @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 , which can fit the observed values of two neutrino mass - squared differences @xmath107 and @xmath108 @xcite . in the leading - order approximation ,",
    "the non - unitary lepton flavor mixing matrix @xmath53 is just the unitary matrix @xmath109 , which arises from the mismatch between the diagonalizations of @xmath110 and @xmath111 . to be more explicit , @xmath112 which is equivalent to the tri - bimaximal mixing pattern @xcite strongly favored by current neutrino oscillation experiments . from eq .",
    "( 9 ) , we can observe that two heavy majorana neutrinos are degenerate in mass .",
    "two remarks are in order : ( 1 ) because of @xmath15 and @xmath113 , the one - loop radiative corrections to light neutrino masses are extremely small and can be neglected @xcite ; ( 2 ) the slight breaking of the @xmath26 symmetry may lead to a tiny mass split of heavy majorana neutrinos , and then the resonant leptogenesis mechanism can be implemented to account for the baryon number asymmetry in the universe @xcite .    to be more accurate",
    ", we can get the masses of three light and two heavy majorana neutrinos after diagonalizing the total @xmath114 neutrino mass matrix by a unitary transformation .",
    "the full parametrization of the corresponding @xmath114 unitary matrix will involve 10 rotation angles @xmath115 and 10 phase angles @xmath116 ( for @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we may adopt the standard parametrization of the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath119 , where @xmath109 is a @xmath120 unitary matrix @xmath121 and @xmath122 is nearly an identity matrix @xmath123 with @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 ( for @xmath127 ) . it is worthwhile to note that the deviation of @xmath122 from the identity matrix measures the unitary violation of neutrino mixing matrix , which is constrained to be below the percent level @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is an excellent approximation to neglect the higher - order terms @xmath128 in eq .",
    "meanwhile , the parametrization of @xmath129 can be taken as @xmath130 it has been stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the charged - current interactions of light and heavy majorana neutrinos are correlated , which is obvious from eq .",
    "( 15 ) and eq .",
    "furthermore , the extra cp - violating phases come into the non - unitary neutrino matrix @xmath53 via the matrix @xmath122 .",
    "thus novel cp - violating effects in the medium - baseline @xmath131 and @xmath132 oscillations may show up and provide a promising signature of the unitarity violation of @xmath53 , which could be measured at a neutrino factory @xcite .",
    "as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the generation of neutrino masses and the collider signals of heavy majorana neutrinos essentially decouple in the realistic seesaw model . therefore , a phenomenological approach to consider collider signals of heavy majorana neutrinos is to take the matrix elements @xmath54 and the heavy majorana neutrino masses @xmath133 ( for @xmath51 ) as independent parameters , which should be consistent with both low - energy and current collider experiments .",
    "this phenomenological approach has been widely used in the literature @xcite , however , only for the one heavy majorana neutrino case .",
