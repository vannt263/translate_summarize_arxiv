    "one prominent phenomenon in the theory of molecular evolution that has also attracted considerable attention in statistical physics is the so - called _",
    "error threshold_. it describes the breakdown of genetic order in mutation - selection models for mutation rates surpassing a certain critical value . the prototype model for the description of the error threshold",
    "is eigen s quasispecies model in sequence space @xcite ( which is effectively equivalent to a coupled mutation - selection model in population genetics , cf @xcite ) , originally designed for the description of prebiotic rna evolution .",
    "however , the threshold is supposed to be a phenomenon that should occur in a rather general class of mutation - selection models .    in order to set up a mutation - selection model that is tractable by analytical ( or at least numerical ) methods ,",
    "severe simplifications of the original biological situation seem to be indispensable .",
    "analytical approaches generally have to restrict to the treatment of infinitly large populations and rather simple fitness functions , such as the sharply peaked landscape of eigens original model .",
    "another common approximation , also used in previous studies of the quasispecies model , amounts for the simplified representation of genotypes as binary strings . in the context of molecular evolutionary theory ,",
    "this may be thought of as representing dna or rna strands by sequences of _ purins _ and _ pyrimidins _ , hence with only two states per site , neglecting the fact that genetic information is really given by a four - letter alphabet . in this article , we present a four - state mutation - selection model which is capable to describe the full nucleotide alphabet and incorporates the standard mutation schemes of molecular phylogeny . in particular , the phase diagramms are discussed in detail which are more polymorphic than for the two - state model .",
    "this shows that , for a full understanding of the error threshold behaviour in molecular evolution , investigations can not be restricted entirely to the study of two - state models",
    ".    one important step towards an understanding of the threshold phenomenon has been its identification with an equilibrium phase transition in physics by the translation of a time - discrete version of the quasispecies model into the transfer matrix of an anisotropic two - dimensional ising model @xcite .",
    "this equivalence was further exploited to study various aspects of the error threshold with methods from statistical physics @xcite .",
    "it turns out , however , that the anisotropy of that model is not so easy to handle and the analysis of the relevant biological quantities ( which correspond to certain surface properties of the ising model ) remains an involved problem . due to the complications of the model , almost all results obtained so far are approximate or numerical . the only exact result for the _ sharply peaked landscape _",
    "@xcite has been worked out via a different analogy to a model of directed polymers , using the specific properties of that very special fitness landscape .",
    "an alternative approach to the analysis of mutation - selection models and the error threshold which avoids some of the problems of the anisotropic ising model has been brought up in @xcite . here , the starting point on the biological side is a slightly changed model which describes the evolution of a population with overlapping generations in continuous time .",
    "it turns out that , after a reformulation in tensor products , the two - state version of this model is equivalent to the hamiltonian of an ising quantum chain .",
    "thereby , the change to continuous time in the biological description corresponds to the anisotropic limit that connects the two - dimensional ising model and the quantum chain in physics ( cf .",
    "the quantum chain model is technically easier to handle , and exact results for two non - trivial fitness landscapes , namely onsager s landscape and the quadratic fitness function , have been worked out @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we extend this latter approach to a full four - state model in this study .",
    "the quantum chain analogy allows to use well - known methods from statistical mechanics for the solution of the model , so that we do not have to dwell on technical details here . for an extended presentation of methods ( with regard to the two - state model ) using techniques from rigorous mean field theory , we refer to @xcite .",
    "the main focus is instead on the discussion of the threshold behaviour and in particular the increased complexity of the phase diagram due to the consideration of the four - state nature of biological information and the refined schemes of molecular mutation rates .    in the following section ,",
    "we start with a presentation of the biological foundations of our model . only thereafter",
    ", we will introduce the quantum chain model in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "analytical and numerical results are presented for a number of specific four - state models with permutation invariant fitness landscapes .",
    "also the properties of finite sequences and the evolution dynamics will be studied .",
    "we close with a summary of our results and a discussion of open problems in section 5 .",
    "genetic information is coded in dna ( and rna ) molecules . these are heteropolymers of four units ( nucleotides ) which differ in a specific base .",
    "the essential aspect of a dna sequence is captured in a string over a four - letter alphabet @xmath0 where each letter represents a particular base : @xmath1 and @xmath2 for adenine and guanine ( the purins ) , @xmath3 and @xmath4 for cytosine and thymine ( the pyrimidins ) . in rna sequences , @xmath4 is replaced by @xmath5 for uracil .",
    "we will therefore treat the @xmath6 different sequences of a fixed , finite length @xmath7 as our genotypes ( which may be thought of as coding for something , such as a virus or an enzyme ) .",
    "disregarding environmental effects , we may identify a collection of genotypes with a _ population _ of haploid ` individuals ' .",
    "evolution then describes the change of the population composition in time .    a standard model for the evolution of an infinite , asexually reproducing population under the basic forces of mutation and selection which works in continuous time is given by the following system of non - linear differential equations @xcite @xmath8 here , @xmath9 denotes the relative frequency of genotype @xmath10 at time @xmath11 with corresponding malthusian fitness ( replication rate minus death rate ) @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the _ mean fitness _ of the population .",
    "it is the origin of the non - linearity in ( [ paramuse ] ) .",
    "finally , @xmath14 is the ( time independent ) rate at which @xmath15 mutates to @xmath10 .",
    "this framework has originally been defined in classical population genetics @xcite . in the sequence space context , it has been introduced in @xcite and has been called the _ para - muse _ ( _ pa_rallel _ mu_tation-_se_lection ) model , since it assumes mutation and selection to act independently and in parallel at each instant of time .",
    "the model ignores recombination and genetic drift due to finite population size .",
    "both assumptions can be considered as fairly reasonable at least in the context of the evolution of viruses or bacteria where populations can be huge and recombination is absent , or the nucleotides are tightly linked . in the following subsections , the basic processes of mutation and selection shall be described in some detail .      we take mutation as a point process acting independently on all sites , ignoring more complicated mechanisms , such as insertions or deletions .",
    "molecular mutation rates shall be chosen according to the following scheme , known as the _ kimura 3 st model _ in molecular phylogeny @xcite :    within this general setup , a number of simpler models is contained , which treat mutation at different levels of sophistication . in the simplest approach ,",
    "the mutation rates between all four nucleotides are assumed to be equal @xmath16 .",
    "this is the so - called _ jukes - cantor mutation scheme_.",
    "while this simple frame already seems to be sufficient for a number of applications , measurements reveal that there are indeed pronounced differences in the mutation rates that should be accounted for in more realistic models .",
    "in particular , the _ transitions _ between the two purins ( a , g ) and the two pyrimidins ( c , t ) are much more frequent than the purin",
    " pyrimidin mutations which are called _",
    "transversions_. this may range up to relative differences of @xmath17 in the nucleus and @xmath18 in mitochondrial dna @xcite . a mutation scheme with @xmath19",
    "is known as the _ kimura 2 parameter model_. the full _ kimura 3 st _ scheme , finally , also accounts for the small difference between @xmath20 and @xmath21 , such that @xmath22 .    implementing this mutation model into the evolution equation ( [ paramuse ] ) , we obtain the following mutation rates between genotypes ( @xmath23 ) @xmath24 here",
    ", @xmath25 are restricted hamming distances between @xmath10 and @xmath15 . in ( [ hamming ] )",
    ", @xmath26 counts the positions at which @xmath27 and @xmath28 are exchanged in @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "finally , @xmath31 is the total hamming distance .",
    "note that the choice of the diagonal term @xmath32 in ( [ mss ] ) just accounts for probability conservation ( @xmath33 ) in the mutation part of the evolution equation ( [ paramuse ] ) .      whereas the mutational part of the dynamics is fairly well understood at least on the microscopic ( molecular ) level , the relation of genotype and fitness , which defines the respective selective success , is notoriously complex .",
    "following the standard notion in molecular evolution , we define the _ fitness function _ ( or _ fitness landscape _ ) @xmath34 as a mapping from the configuration space @xmath35 into the real numbers , assigning a reproduction rate ( malthusian fitness value ) @xmath36 to each genotype .",
    "implicitly , the fitness function incorporates all the complicated interactions between the sites .",
    "these interactions are typically long - ranged ( since rna strands or proteins fold in three dimensions ) , highly correlated , and give rise to rather rugged landscapes . especially in the context of rna evolution ,",
    "the construction and characterization of fitness landscapes has motivated numerous studies , see e.g.  @xcite for a review .",
    "below we will show how the evolution equation ( [ paramuse ] ) , with an arbitrary choice of the fitness function , can be adapted to the methods from statistical physics by a reformulation in a quantum chain framework . as an application",
    ", we then present a study ( including analytical and numerical results ) for specific examples from the class of permutation invariant fitness functions .",
    "here , due to equivalence of all sites , the fitness of a given genotype is solely a function of its restricted hamming distances from the so called _ wildtype _ sequence with optimal fitness which we choose as the reference genotype .",
    "this particularly simple class of fitness landscapes is widely used , as a canonical first approximation , especially in _ multilocus theory_. also in the context of sequence space evolution , fitness functions of this type have been used in a number of studies on the two - state model @xcite . to implement the approach in our four - state model ,",
    "we fix an arbitrary sequence , denoted by @xmath37 , as the wildtype .",
    "we will only consider directional selection here towards a unique genotype with optimal fitness .",
    "the fitness of any other sequence is then determined by the restricted hamming distances @xmath38 relative to @xmath37 .",
    "permutation invariance with respect to the position in the sequence thus leads to a drastic reduction of dimensions .",
    "for the four - state model , the effective configuration space forms a tetrahedron in 3d ( see fig .",
    "[ select ] ) and is conveniently represented in cartesian coordinates which we shall call ( following @xcite ) the _ surplus components _ : @xmath39    with this choice , any unstructured random sequence has coordinates @xmath40 ( with probability 1 in the limit @xmath41 ) .",
    "any positive value of a surplus component , on the other hand , signals a non - trivial overlap of the sequence with the wildtype @xmath37 .",
    "in particular , @xmath42 measures the surplus of sites with purins or pyrimidins as given in @xmath37 over the purin  pyrimidin mutated sites .    within this frame ,",
    "a natural class of permutation invariant fitness functions is @xmath43\\ ] ] which includes the following special cases    * setting @xmath44 and @xmath45 , we obtain the purely additive _ fujiyama landscape _ without genetic interactions . here",
    ", every mutation relative to the wildtype has a fixed deleterious effect , independent of any other mutation that may be present in the sequence .",
    "the additive landscape is a canonical zeroth - order approximation , ignoring any kind of genetic interactions . in the context of sequence evolution",
    ", this fitness function has been discussed e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "* with the choice @xmath46 , the model corresponds to a concave quadratic fitness function ( with directional selection ) as it is frequently met in multilocus theory . due to the gene interactions , existing mutations tend to aggravate further ones , which is called _ positive epistasis_. * for @xmath47 and @xmath48",
    ", we finally obtain a convex fitness function for directional selection with long - range gene interactions and _ negative epistasis _ ( existing mutations tend to alleviate further ones ) .",
    "since we want to have @xmath37 as unique wildtype sequence and a fitness function which is monotonous in the surplus components , we restrict @xmath49 to the octant @xmath50 and ( smoothly ) truncate the fitness function by introduction of a step function @xmath51 whenever frequencies of genotypes with @xmath52 are non - zero : @xmath53\\;.\\ ] ]    the variables @xmath54 and @xmath55 may further be used to distinguish between the effects of the different types of mutations ( as defined in fig [ mutfig ] ) on the fitness . in this article",
    ", we will present explicit results for the two following cases :    1 .   for the simplest choice",
    ", @xmath56 and @xmath57 , any mutation away from the wildtype has the same effect .",
    "together with the jukes - cantor mutation scheme , symmetry here leads to equal values of the surplus components in the mutation ",
    "selection equilibrium .",
    "the model may thus also be thought of as a two - state model , where any site is only regarded as occupied either with a _ wildtype _ or with a _ mutant _ nucleotide .",
    "in contrast to the simple two - state model of @xcite , however , there is an effectively asymmetric mutation rate between wildtype and mutant in the case considered here .",
    "2 .   in a more refined model ,",
    "we distinguish between transitions and transversions . in the mutational part , this is done by applying the kimura 2 parameter mutation scheme . in the fitness function",
    ", we take into account that the deleterious effects of the transversions often dominate over those of the transitions : @xmath58 and/or @xmath59 .",
    "since mutation is a random process that is independent of the fitness values of the genotypes involved , the molecular mutation scheme consequently makes no reference to fitness concepts like the _ wildtype_. biological observables measurable from sequence data , such as the surplus components ( [ surplus ] ) , and also the fitness functions as defined in ( [ fit ] ) or ( [ fit2 ] ) , on the other hand , are defined relative to the wildtype sequence . in order to set up these concepts in a common framework",
    ", it is convenient to reformulate also the mutational part of the evolution equation in coordinates relative to the wildtype .",
    "this may always be done due to certain symmetries inherent in the mutation scheme of fig .",
    "[ mutfig ] .",
    "the basic symmetry of the mutation scheme , if all three mutation rates @xmath60 are pairwise different , is @xmath61 ( klein s 4-group ) , generated by two involutions .",
    "if we write the operations in standard permutation notation , we can take as generators the transformations @xmath62 both being the product of two transpositions .",
    "this symmetry may now be exploited for a redefinition of the mutation scheme in wildtype coordinates . to this end , we fix , for every site of the wildtype sequence , the element of the 4-group ( in the above representation ) with the letter of the wildtype nucleotide in the first position ( e.g. the string @xmath63 for wildtype nuceotide @xmath4 ) .",
    "an alternative representation of the configuration space in wildtype coordinates as @xmath64 is now given by the mapping , on each site , of the string of labels @xmath65 to the symmetry element of 4-group defined above . with this notation",
    ", the three types of mutations included in the kimura 3 st scheme simply switch the signs of the labels : @xmath66 at rate @xmath20 , @xmath67 at rate @xmath68 , and @xmath69 at rate @xmath21 .",
    "higher symmetries of the mutation model are obtained if mutation rates are equal .",
    "for the kimura 2 parameter scheme , @xmath70 , the operation @xmath71 is also a symmetry and generates a cyclic group @xmath72 . together with the previous @xmath61 , this generates a dihedral group , @xmath73 , with 8 elements . finally , if @xmath74 , we additionally get the simple transposition @xmath75 and have the full permutation group @xmath76 as symmetry .",
    "note that @xmath76 , which corresponds to the full tetrahedral group with 24 elements , is also the symmetry group of the configuration space of permutation invariant configurations visualized in fig .",
    "[ select ] .",
    "the _ global _ symmetry ( with the same transformation acting at each site simultaneously ) of our class of mutation - selection models with fitness functions according to ( [ fit ] ) is therefore always a subgroup of @xmath76 .",
    "in particular , the symmetric fitness model with @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and jukes - cantor mutation scheme possesses @xmath79 symmetry , or the full tetrahedral symmetry if the linear part in the fitness function vanishes ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "the transition - transversion model finally , with @xmath81 , or @xmath82 , and kimura 2 parameter mutation has simple @xmath83 symmetry , or @xmath73 symmetry if @xmath84 . in the latter case , the combination of @xmath85 with @xmath86 is necessary , not a misprint .",
    "other combinations with global @xmath73 symmetry are @xmath87 and @xmath88 .      with the above preparations",
    ", we may now follow the lines of @xcite where the two - state model is treated .    in a first step",

    "the relation has the following intuitive interpretation : the change in mean fitness is driven by two independent forces .",
    "the first one stems from the change of genotype frequencies due to selection and is proportional to the variance of fitness values present in the population .",

    "both these extensions lead to a coupling of the chains , and an even richer phase space structure is found , including first - order transitions . as may be seen from the introduction of a small linear field term into the fitness function in subsection 4.2",
