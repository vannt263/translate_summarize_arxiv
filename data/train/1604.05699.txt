    "recently , acoustic effects in bulk and low dimensional materials have attracted lots of attention .",
    "this is due to the need to find coherent acoustic phonons for scientific applications as against the use of direct current  @xcite .",
    "materials such as homogenous semiconductors , superlattices ( sl ) , graphene and carbon nanotubes ( cnt ) are good candidates for such studies due to their properties such as the high scattering mechanism , the high - bias mean - free path ( @xmath10 ) and their sizes which enable strong electron - phonon interaction to occur in them resulting in acoustic phonon scattering .",
    "acoustic waves through these materials are characterized by a set of elementary resonance excitations and dynamic non - linearity which normally lead to an absorption ( or amplification ) , acoustoelectric effect ( ae )  @xcite and acoustomagnetoelectric effect ( ame )  @xcite .",
    "the concept of acoustic wave amplification in bulk materials was predicted by tolpygo and uriskii(1956 )  @xcite , and in n - ge by pomerantz  @xcite . in sl ,",
    "mensah et .",
    "@xcite studied hypersound absorption(amplification ) and established its use as a phonon filter and in  @xcite predicted the use of the sl as hypersound generator which was confirmed in  @xcite . in graphene ,",
    "al  @xcite treated theoretically hypersound amplification but dompreh et.al .",
    "@xcite further proved that absorption also occurs in the material .",
    "experimentally , miseikis et .",
    "@xcite , bhandu and nash  @xcite studied acoustoelectric effect in graphene .",
    "+ carbon nanotubes ( cnt ) on the other hand , are cylindrical hollow rod of graphene sheets whose electronic structures are determined by the localized @xmath3-electrons in the @xmath11- hybridized bonds .",
    "absorption ( amplification ) of hypersound in undoped cnt has been carried out theoretically by dompreh et .",
    "@xcite and experimentally by  @xcite .",
    "other forms of research such as hot - electron effect  @xcite , thermopower in cnt  @xcite have been carried out .",
    "flourine - modified cnt ( f - cnt ) is off - late attracting a lot of scientific interest .",
    "this is attained by doping the cnt with fluorine thus forming double periodic band cnt changing from metallic to semiconductor . as per the studies conducted by jeon et .",
    "@xcite , absorption in f - cnt is less than that of swnt but no studies have been done on the absorption of f - cnt in the hypersound regime . in this paper , the study of absorption of acoustic phonons in metallic swnt and f - cnt are theoretically studied .",
    "here , the acoustic wave considered has wavelength @xmath12 , smaller than the mean - free path of the cnt and then treated as a packet of coherent phonons ( monochromatic phonons ) having a @xmath13-function distribution as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the phonon wavevector , @xmath16 is the planck s constant divided by @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the sound flux density , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are respectively the frequency and the group velocity of sound wave with wavevector @xmath21 .",
    "it is assumed that the sound wave is propagated along the @xmath22-axis of the cnt .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , the absorption coefficient for f - cnt and swnt are calculated . in section 3 ,",
    "the final equations are analyzed numerically and presented graphically .",
    "section 4 presents the conclusion of the study .",
    "proceeding as in @xcite , the acoustic phonon absorption coefficient is given as @xmath23\\delta(\\varepsilon_{p_{z}+q}-\\varepsilon_{p_{z}}-\\hbar\\omega_{q})dp_z\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the unperturbed boltzmann distribution function , @xmath25 is the phonon momentum , @xmath26 is the energy dispersion , @xmath27 is the deformation potential and @xmath28 is the density of the cnt . the distribution function is given as @xmath29\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the chemical potential of the system , @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath33 is the absolute temperature and @xmath34 is the normalization constant to be determined from the normalization condition @xmath35 as @xmath36\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath37 is the surface concentration of charge carriers and @xmath38 is the modified bessel function . for a chemically modified f - cnt , where the fluorine atoms form a one - dimensional chain ,",

    "is @xmath46 from energy conservation principle , the momentum ( @xmath25 ) can be deduced from the delta function part of eqn.(@xmath47 ) as @xmath48 by substituting @xmath25 into the distribution function in eqn.(@xmath47 ) , and after some cumbersome calculations yields @xmath49\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the heaviside step function @xmath52 to compare the result with an undoped swnt , we follow the same procedure as that of f - cnt . using the tight - binding energy dispersion of the @xmath25 orbital which is given as : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the hopping integral parameter , @xmath55 is the c - c bonding distance , and ( @xmath56 ) and ( @xmath57 ) signs are respectively the conduction and valence band . when @xmath58 , the conduction and valence bands cross each other near the fermi points , @xmath59 giving the metallic nature to the armchair tube .",
    "putting @xmath58 , and making the substitution , @xmath60 in eqn.(@xmath61 ) gives @xmath62 where @xmath63 see  @xcite .",
    "eqn.(@xmath64 ) is equivalent to the energy dispersion in eqn.(@xmath65 ) when @xmath66 , which is @xmath67 using eqn.(@xmath64 ) , the absorption in swnt is calculated as @xmath68 where @xmath69",
    "the general expressions for the hypersound absorption in f - cnt ( @xmath0 ) and in swnt ( @xmath1 ) are presented in eqn.(@xmath70 ) and eqn.(@xmath71 ) respectively . in both equations ,",
    "the absorptions are dependent on the frequency ( @xmath72 ) , the acoustic wavenumber ( @xmath21 ) , and temperature ( @xmath33 ) as well as other parameters such as the inter - atomic distances , the velocity of sound ( @xmath73 ) and the deformation potential ( @xmath27 ) . in both expressions",
    "( see eqn.(@xmath70 ) and eqn.(@xmath71 ) ) a transparency window is observed : for f - cnt is @xmath74 ; and for swnt is @xmath75 .",
    "these are the consequence of conservation laws . the equations ( @xmath70 ) and ( @xmath76 ) , are analyzed numerically with the following parameters used : @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",
    "the results are graphically plotted ( see fig .",
    "@xmath83 , @xmath47 , and @xmath84 ) .",
    "figure @xmath83 shows the dependence of the sound absorption coefficient on the the frequency ( @xmath72 ) for varying @xmath21 . in both graphs ,",
    "the absorption is initially high but falls off sharply and then changes slowly at high values of @xmath72 .",
    "increasing the values of @xmath21 correspondingly increased the obtained graph in both doped f - cnt and undoped swnt though the magnitude of absorption obtained in swnt exceeds that of f - cnt , that is , @xmath85 .",
    "this is in accordance with the work of jeon et .",
    "al .  @xcite .",
    "in figure @xmath47 , the graph increases to a maximum point then drops off .",
    "it then changes again slowly at high @xmath21 for both undoped swnt and doped f - cnt . by increasing the temperature",
    ", the the amplitude of the graphs reduces . for @xmath4 , the maximum absorption in @xmath86 whilst that of @xmath87 which gives the ratio of the absorption @xmath5 , whilst at @xmath6 , @xmath7 and at @xmath8 , we had @xmath9 .",
    "clearly , we noticed that the ratio decreases with an increase in temperature . to aid a better understanding of the comparison between the absorption obtained in both swnt and f - cnt ,",
    "a semilog plot is presented in figure @xmath84 which clearly shows that the undoped swnt absorbs more than the doped f - cnt .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that the presence of f - cnt atoms leads to chemical activation of a passive surface cnt by adding additional electronic band structure and altering the carbon @xmath3-bonds around the fermi level in a non - linear manner thus forming a band structure of width two periods  @xcite .",
    "as flourine is highly electronegative it thus weakens the walls of the cnt as it approaches it .",
    "the @xmath3-electrons attached to the flourine which causes less free charge carriers to interact with the phonons .",
    "current researches have predicted @xmath11 bonding charge change to @xmath88 by f - functionlization  @xcite .",
    "this bonding charge change would reduce the density of free carriers , consequently leading to the magnitude reduction of the absorption  @xcite .",
    "the absorption of hypersound in f - cnt and swnt was theoretically calculated in the regime @xmath89 . from the numerical analysis ,",
    "the graphs of the absorptions in f - cnt and swnt are plotted and compared .",
    "the flourine functionalization affects the absorption properties of f - cnt .",
    "the swnt absorbs more than the f - cnt as was observed by jeon et .",
