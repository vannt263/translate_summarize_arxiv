    "the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ; ford et al . 1998 ) virgo cluster survey is a project based on observations with the acs on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( ) , aimed at the exploration of the properties of 100 early  type galaxies in the virgo cluster , the study of their globular cluster systems , and the reconstruction of virgo s three dimensional structure . to measure the galaxy distances needed to realize these goals , we have used measurements of surface brightness fluctuations ( sbf ) .",
    "the sbf method was first proposed by tonry & schneider ( 1988 ) and it is based on the fact that the variance of normalized poissonian fluctuations of the galaxy stellar population depends on galaxy distance ( for reviews see jacoby et al .",
    "1992 and blakeslee et al . 1999 ) . at present",
    ", sbf measurements have been used to determine galaxy distances out to @xmath11  7000  km  s@xmath12 , using data from ground  based telescopes and  ( ajhar  1997 , 2001 ; tonry  1997 , 2001 ; jensen  1999 , 2003 ; blakeslee  2001 , 2002 ; mei  2001 , 2003 ; liu 2001 , 2002 ; mieske et al .",
    "2003 ; and references in mei et  al .",
    "2005 , hereafter paper  iv ) .    for the virgo cluster in particular ,",
    "sbf measurements have been published by several groups using data from both ground  based telescopes ( tonry et al .",
    "1990 , 2000 , 2001 ; pahre & mould 1994 ; jensen et al .  1998 ; jerjen et al . 2004 ) and  ( ajhar et al .  1997 ; neilsen & tsvetanov 2000 ; jensen et al .  2003 ) .",
    "west & blakeslee ( 2000 ) have used published ground - based sbf data in a first examination of the three - dimensional structure of this cluster , particularly the cluster s `` principal axis '' and its relations to the surrounding large - scale structure .",
    "our new acs dataset ( for details , see ct et  al .",
    "2004 ; paper  i ) constitutes the largest , most complete , and most homogeneous sbf sample of virgo galaxies yet assembled .",
    "since the absolute magnitude of the sbf varies as a function of the stellar population age and metallicity , sbf distance measurements in a given observational bandpass must be carefully calibrated in terms of stellar population observables , typically the galaxy color . using an extensive ground - based @xmath13-band sbf survey , tonry et al .",
    "( 1997 , 2001 ) have established that it is possible to calibrate the sbf method using the integrated galaxy colors . in particular",
    ", they find that for bright ellipticals : 1 ) the absolute sbf magnitude @xmath14 is a linear function of the galaxy @xmath15 color over the range @xmath16 with an internal scatter @xmath17  mag ; 2 ) the zero - point of this relation is universal over this color range ; 3 ) the slope of the relation is consistent with theoretical predictions from recent stellar population models . for observational bands other than the @xmath13-band ,",
    "the relation between sbf absolute magnitude and galaxy colors has to be calibrated in that particular band .",
    "ajhar et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and jensen et al .",

    "this paper provides the first calibration for sbf using the f850lp filter with the acs , i.e , calibration of the absolute f850lp sbf magnitude @xmath3 , as a function of dereddened color in the f475w and f850lp filters .",
    "observations and sbf reductions have already been described in paper  i , jordn et al .",
    "( 2004 ; paper  ii ) and paper  iv . in ",
    "2 the main steps of the sbf reduction are briefly summarized . in ",
    "3 the calibration method is discussed and the results are presented and analyzed . in   4 the theoretical predictions from bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) stellar population models are discussed .",
    "we summarize and conclude in   5 .",
    "the calibration presented here will be used in future papers to derive sbf distances for the galaxies in our sample and to explore the three - dimensional structure of the virgo cluster .",
    "our observations and data reduction procedures have been discussed in paper  i and paper  ii , respectively . in paper  iv , we have addressed the specific issues related to sbf measurements with the acs .",
    "since the acs camera presents significant geometrical distortions , the correction of these distortions involves image resampling by an interpolation kernel . for our sbf measurements we use images geometrically corrected with the _ drizzle _ software ( fruchter & hook 2002 ) using the lancsoz3 interpolation kernel .",
    "we have shown in paper  iv that , when using this kernel , the distortion correction does not add significant error to the sbf distance measurements .",
    "the main steps of sbf measurements are also described in paper  iv .",
    "we summarize here the main points .",
    "we measure sbf in the f850lp bandpass of the acs wide field camera .",
    "the process involves fitting a smooth model to each galaxy in both the f850lp and the f475w band ( papers  ii and  iv ) and subtracting the models from the original images to produce `` residual images '' .",
    "the residual images in each band are then used to construct catalogs of external sources , i.e. globular clusters and background galaxies . from these catalogs",
    "we create a source mask to remove the contamination from the sources to the surface brightness variance .",
    "all sources brighter than a completeness magnitude @xmath18 , that corresponds to a completeness of @xmath19 at a given radius , are masked from the image .",
    "the power spectrum of the residuals is then calculated in multiple concentric annuli centered on the galaxy center , by multiplying successive annular mask functions with the source mask ( i.e. , the total mask function ) .",
    "the image power spectrum is the sum of two components : a flat , white noise power spectrum and the combined power spectrum of the sbf and undetected external sources , both convolved by the psf ( point spread function ) in the spatial domain . in the fourier domain",
    ", this sum can be written as : @xmath20 where the `` expectation power spectrum '' @xmath21 is the convolution of the power spectra of the normalized psf and of the total mask function of the annular region being analyzed . in paper",
    "iv we have shown that this power spectrum is not significantly modified by pixel correlation induced by our interpolation kernel ( see paper  iv for details ) .",
    "armed with a clearer understanding of the systematic errors arising from the data interpolation , we have measured unbiased values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 for multiple annuli in each galaxy as described in paper  iv . as the minimum innermost radius",
    ", we have taken @xmath24 .",
    "however when dust is present in the galaxy center , the dust regions are masked ( see paper  i ) , and the minimum radius without dust contamination has been taken as the minimum annular radius .",
    "for the maximum outermost annular radius , we have chosen the radius where the galaxy brightness falls to half that of the sky ( the range of maximum outermost radii being between @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) .",
    "the next step is then to extract the sbf signal from @xmath22 by subtracting off the residual variance @xmath27 from faint sources including undetected globular clusters and distant background galaxies . because of the exquisite resolution and depth of our acs images , these correction are very small ( see the following section ) .",
    "the contribution to the power spectrum from these external sources is indistinguishable from the sbf contribution , since both are spatially convolved with the psf .",
    "following tonry  ( 1990 ) and blakeslee & tonry ( 1995 ) , we can write    @xmath28    where @xmath29 @xmath30 is the contribution to the fluctuations due to globular clusters , and @xmath31 is the contribution due to background galaxies . the mean galaxy brightness in the denominator is chosen for compatibility with the @xmath22 definition above .    to estimate the @xmath27 contribution ,",
    "sources were extracted from the same catalog used for masking external sources from the residual images ( see above and paper  iv ) .",
    "source counts were fitted to a composite globular cluster and external source luminosity function using a maximum likelihood approach .",
    "for the former , we adopted a gaussian luminosity function , where @xmath32 is a function of both radius @xmath33 ( distance from the galaxy center ) and magnitude @xmath34 : @xmath35 for the virgo cluster in the f850lp filter , we expect @xmath36 23  mag and @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "we use these values as our initial estimates but iterate on @xmath38 to improve the fitted luminosity functions .",
    "for the background galaxies , we assumed a power - law luminosity function : @xmath39 with @xmath40 . from the acs faint galaxy counts of benitez et al .",
    "( 2004 ) @xmath41 in the f814w filter . at present , a value for @xmath42 in f850lp is unavailable in the literature .",
    "however , the f814w and f850lp bandpasses are quite similar so we expect no strong differences in @xmath42 between these filters .",
    "a fit of faint galaxy counts in our acs blank fields gives us a slope of @xmath43 ( peng et al .",
    "2005 ) . if we vary @xmath42 in the range 0.33 to 0.37 , our fits produce differences of only a few thousandths of a magnitude in the final sbf magnitudes .    in fitting the total source counts ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 )",
    ", we kept as fixed parameters @xmath46 and @xmath42 , and iterated on @xmath38 , as a function of the galaxy distance .",
    "sources identified as bright foreground stars were removed from the images but not included in the fits . from the estimated @xmath44 and @xmath45 per pixel",

    "an example of the external source luminosity function is shown in fig  [ gc_example ] for ngc  4472 ( vcc  1226 ) .",
    "finally , the @xmath51-band sbf magnitudes are given by @xmath52 the uncertainty on @xmath53 in each galaxy has been calculated by propagating the measurement errors in eq .",
    "[ eq : mag ] for the different annuli .",
    "this means that we have added in quadrature the errors due to the uncertainty in the fit of @xmath22 , the uncertainty in the galaxy flux , and the uncertainty in @xmath47 ( @xmath11 25% @xmath47 , calculated as the variance in @xmath47 when different initial fit parameter are chosen ) .",
    "we neglect the @xmath81% systematic uncertainty in @xmath54 ( sirianni et al .",

    "the total uncertainty on the average @xmath53 for each galaxy has been calculated as the quadrature sum of the errors for the different annuli which we are averaging , divided by the number of annuli .    finally , since @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the galaxy distance , two more sources of uncertainty must be added in quadrature to the measurement error in @xmath53 for the purpose of this calibration .",
    "first , we include an expected `` cosmic scatter '' of 0.05  mag in @xmath3 ( see tonry et al .",
    "1997 ) , representing the intrinsic dispersion in @xmath3 for galaxies at the same observed color .",
    "second , an uncertainty of 0.11  mag is introduced to account for the actual distance dispersion from depth effects in the virgo cluster .",
    "this value has been derived from the rms scatter of @xmath57 in position on the sky of the 100 galaxies in our sample .",
    "we seek to calibrate @xmath3 as a function of the galaxy color ( f475w@xmath58f850lp ) , hereafter referred to , since the acs @xmath59 approximates the sdss @xmath60 and f850lp the sdss @xmath51 .",
    "the galaxy colors are measured in the same annuli , and with the same masks , as those used for measuring the sbf .",
    "the sky values in the two filters for our final calibration sample are the same as in paper  ii .",
    "galaxies for which the sky estimates were especially difficult ( due to strong gradients from bright neighboring galaxies ) have been excluded for the purposes of this calibration ( see below ) .",
    "the errors on the colors have been calculated by summing in quadrature the error in galaxy flux and the error due to sky subtraction . when the colors have been averaged on more annuli , the errors in each one",
    "have been added in quadrature , squared and divided by number of annuli .",
    "an additional uncertainty of 0.01  mag in color is added in quadrature as an estimate of the error due to imperfect flatfielding ( see , e.g. , sirianni  2005 ) .",
    "the colors have been dereddened as explained in paper  ii , with the reddening for each galaxy position from schlegel et al .",

    "the ajhar  and jensen  samples ( due the small field sizes ) were mainly confined to the central regions of bright galaxies , which tend to be quite red .",
    "blakeslee  ( 2001 ) concluded that this fact explained the steep slope found by ajhar , since the stellar population models predict a steepening of the sbf  color relation for very red populations .",

    "it is also worth noting that if we had adopted the virgo distance modulus of @xmath116 obtained by calibrating sbf to the freedman  ( 2001 ) cepheid distances that use the new period  luminosity calibration but omit the metallicity correction , then the difference with respect to the model - predicted distance modulus would be only @xmath122  mag .",
    "our sample of early - type galaxies spans a wide range in metallicity and , presumably , age . like the observations ,",
    "the theoretical predictions also show a steeper slope at the red end , and a shallower at the blue end .",
    "the slopes predicted from linear fits to the overall model predictions are @xmath123 for @xmath124  mag , @xmath125 for @xmath126  mag , and @xmath127 for @xmath128  mag ( in very good agreement with our empirical slope over the full range ) .",
    "if we fit only metallicities less than or equal to solar , at the red end the slope will be @xmath129 , compared to @xmath130 in the blue . the agreement between theoretical predictions and",
    "our empirical calibration is somewhat better at the red end .",
    "this is likely due to better accuracy in the modeling of highly evolved populations .",
    "the sbf predictions for young to intermediate - age populations is less certain due mainly to the uncertainties in the modeling of the asymptotic giant branch contributions .",
    "furthermore , models of old stellar populations are better constrained by observations of galactic globular clusters . for these reasons ,",
    "we prefer our empirical blue - end slope , although additional sbf measurements of large homogeneous samples of dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , in the fornax cluster ) would be helpful in refining the sbf calibration for blue early - type galaxies .    considering the uncertainty in the virgo distance modulus",
    ", we conclude that our @xmath2 sbf data for the giant early - type galaxies are well reproduced by the models for stellar populations ages greater than 3  gyr and metallicities in the range between 40% and 250% solar .",
    "the data for the dwarf galaxies are consistent with either much younger ( less than 3  gyr ) solar metallicity populations or intermediate - to - old stellar populations with metallicities in the range 20%40% solar .",
    "as part of the acs virgo cluster survey , we have observed 100 early  type galaxies in the virgo cluster .",
    "we have measured sbf magnitudes in these galaxies with the aim of determining their distances and the three - dimensional structure of virgo .",
    "we have presented the first calibration of the sbf method using the acs instrument , giving the f850w sbf magnitude as a function of galaxy @xmath0 color .",
    "obvious outliers , most likely due to a real dispersion in distance for galaxies in the virgo cluster region , have been omitted from this calibration , leaving 82 galaxies with @xmath0 colors ranging between 0.9 and 1.6  mag . over this color range , the blue ( mainly dwarf ) and",
    "red ( mainly giant ) galaxies follow different linear relations , with the slope being shallower at the blue end . for the first time in sbf studies ,",
    "our sample allows us to empirically calibrate sbf for dwarf early  type galaxies .    by comparing with stellar population models from bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) , we find that the slope of the model prediction for @xmath53 with @xmath65 color is highly consistent with the observed relation for the red galaxy subsample .",
    "there is also general consistency at the blue end , though the stellar population models with young ages and low - metallicities predict a somewhat shallower slope than observed .",
    "this underscores the importance of empirical calibrations , as well as more realistic composite populations in any effort to model the behavior of the sbf method theoretically , especially for dwarf galaxies , for which the scatter in stellar population properties is larger .",
    "a forthcoming paper will present the distances to the individual galaxies derived with this calibration , and examine the issue of virgo s three dimensional structure and its implications for galaxy and globular cluster properties .",
