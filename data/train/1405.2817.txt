    "generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) were conceptually introduced in connection with the partonic description of deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) @xcite and deeply virtual meson production ( dvmp ) @xcite . in leading power w.r.t .  the inverse photon virtuality these processes factorize in a perturbatively calculable hard - scattering part and universal , i.e. , process - independent , however , conventionally defined gpds .",
    "factorization theorems were derived for these processes to the leading twist - two level , i.e. , for transverse polarized photons in dvcs @xcite and longitudinal polarized photons in dvmp @xcite .",
    "the broad interest on gpds arises from the fact that they encode non - perturbative dynamics of the constituents , i.e. , partons in hadrons or even nuclei , on the amplitude level .",
    "in fact they might be interpreted as an overlap of light - front wave functions @xcite .",
    "adding to the extensive studies of form factors and parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , gpds offer a complementary insight into the nucleon and nuclei .",
    "comprehensive reviews about gpds , their interpretation , and the phenomenology are given in refs .",
    "we would like here to point out only the most two important goals of gpd phenomenology .",
    "for vanishing skewness , i.e. , @xmath0 , their fourier transforms to the impact parameter space possess in the infinite momentum frame a probabilistic interpretation @xcite .",
    "namely , they give the probability to find a parton with a given momentum fraction @xmath1 and transversal distance from the nucleon center .",
    "we emphasize that parton densities , intensively studied in inclusive processes , can only provide the parton distribution with respect to the longitudinal momentum fraction .",
    "we consider a three - dimensional resolution of the nucleon ( and other hadrons ) or even nuclei as a feasible task that can be already undertaken at present in a model dependent manner .",
    "another novel application arises from the fact that their second mellin moment with respect to @xmath1 gives the fraction of angular momentum carried by the particular parton flavor @xcite .",
    "consequently , one of the main goals of the gpd phenomenology is the resolution of the spin decomposition of the proton in partonic degrees of freedom . so far",
    "the spin content of the nucleon , in particular of the sea quark and gluon contributions , is not well understood .",
    "triggered by these promises , the experimental efforts in measuring dvcs and dvmp processes during the last few years led to an ever increasing amount and precision of data for various observables .",
    "in particular , data have been taken by the hera collaborations in the fixed target experiment hermes , ( dvcs : @xcite , dvmp : @xcite ) and the collider experiments h1 and zeus , e.g. , ( dvcs : h1 @xcite , zeus @xcite , dvmp : @xcite ) at the deutsches elektronen synchrotron ( desy ) .",
    "precession measurements are performed within dedicated experiments from the hall a and clas collaborations at the thomas jefferson national laboratory ( jlab ) ( clas @xcite and hall a @xcite , dvmp : @xcite ) and new data sets are expected to be analyzed and released soon .",
    "further measurements are planed after the @xmath2 upgrade .",
    "moreover , experimental measurements with a muon beam are planned to be performed by the compass ii collaboration at the organisation europenne pour la recherche nuclaire ( cern ) , switzerland .",
    "the perturbative factorization approach has been confronted with simple gpd anstze that are adjusted to phenomenological pdf parametrizations and form factor data .",
    "the first measurements of photon electroproduction were easily understood at leading order ( lo ) in terms of oversimplified gpd models , where the momentum fraction and momentum transfer square dependence are factorized in terms of pdfs and form factors , e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "in particular , the sizable first dvcs beam spin asymmetry measurements @xcite were reproduced .",
    "however , it became also clear that the cross section normalization of various hard exclusive processes at large energies , predicted to lo , overshoot the measured ones of h1 and zeus collider experiments and that even for dvcs the quantitative gpd description of various observables is not satisfactory @xcite . to overcome these phenomenological issues ,",
    "a global gpd fitting framework is under development , which is based on flexible gpd models @xcite .",
    "presently , a good description of unpolarized dvcs world data set , including dvmp data at small @xmath3 is reached @xcite and a reasonable description of polarized dvcs data could be achieved , too @xcite .",
    "note that such a good description of dvcs observables has not been succeeded with popular gpd models or even with inconsistent ones .",

    "thus , one should stay inside this framework otherwise the term ` universality ' loses its meaning . in the following we shortly summarize what has been calculated in the collinear framework and the models which are utilized .",

    "the richness of information , contained in gpds , make them most valuable sources to reveal the longitudinal and transversal distributions of partons .",
    "on the other hand their intricate variable dependence complicates their access from experimental measurements and one should clearly stay that addressing the main goals in gpd phenomenology , i.e. , nucleon spin decomposition and imaging , will be based on gpd modeling . obviously , to get a partonic interpretation one must first describe the experimental data , which is only possible with flexible gpd models and a global fitting procedure while so far model predictions work only to some certain extend .",
    "based on the present theory , it is a straightforward procedure to improve the gpd framework of global fitting , developed in @xcite , where in future also information on elastic and gravitational ( or generalized ) form factors will be employed . technically , the mellin - barnes integral representation allows for a simple implementation of such constraints and , moreover , numerically efficient and robust routines can be written .",
    "new experiments with dedicated detectors are planned at compass ii and jlab@12@xmath267 , which will fill the kinematical gap between hermes and h1/zeus experiments as well as between previous jlab@6@xmath267 and hermes experiments .",
    "in particular it is expected that the high - luminosity experiments at jlab will provide a large and high precision data set which will be very important for a global gpd analysis .",
    "it is worth to mention that having a transverse polarized target at compass would allow to address the sea quark and gluon content of the gpd @xmath37 and this provides a model dependent access to the angular momentum of these parton species .",
    "proposed electron - proton / ion scattering experiments such as the large - hadron - electron - collider at cern @xcite and a electron - ion - collider ( eic ) @xcite would allow to measure exclusive processes in the very small-@xmath3 region and in the small-@xmath3 region for polarized target .",

    "as argued in @xcite , also pure hadronic reaction might be interesting for phenomenology .",
    "another interesting possibility is to access gpds in hard exclusive processes that are measured in neutrino experiments , see discussions in @xcite , which allow for a flavor separation in weak dvcs experiments .",
    "dvcs and dvmp experiments with a neutron target @xcite provides another possibility to address the problem of flavor separation .",
    "these deeply virtual processes can be also measured with a nuclei target , which has its own interest .",
    "finally , let us emphasize that the gpd analysis of present and future measurements is much more intricate as for inclusive processes and that we already witnessed over interpretations of measurements , driven by the wish to address the two main goals of gpd phenomenology . surely , to provide a gpd interpretation of high precision data , expected in the future",
    ", one should not only be able to describe data rather one needs models that can be considered as realistic and respect also positivity constraints .",
    "this problem can be only overcome in the wave function overlap representation , where _ duality _ can be used to obtain the complete gpd from a diagonal parton overlap . although some work has been done in this direction @xcite , such models are at present not flexible enough for fitting . in principle , such a field theoretical framework allows also to include transverse momentum dependence and points in the direction of a unifying description of hard inclusive , semi - inclusive , and exclusive processes @xcite .",
