    "the sparse population of agb stars above the trgb is expected in gcs since this phase of stellar evolution is particularly short - lived and also because the very low mass of stars in gcs ( @xmath26@xmath27 ) prevents agb luminosity from climbing much above the trgb .",

    "the dashed line in figure  [ fig : lumfnc ] marks the sensitivity limit at each bandpass , and shows that the photometry is the most incomplete at 3.6 and 4.5  , which is likely due to severe stellar crowding in the cluster core at these wavelengths .",

    "however , while many of the very red stars on the mid- to lower - rgb in figure  [ fig : cmd1 ] may be dusty , it is very likely that some of the these sources are red due either to mismatches across bands , photometric errors , or contamination from cluster non - members .",

    "no metallicity separation is evident in the _ spitzer _ cmds .",
    "inspection of the luminosity functions ( fig .",

    "we identify 75 mass - losing agb candidates , several of which have a red excess , although mass - loss can occur even without a dusty circumstellar envelope @xcite .",
    "the agb population is slightly more centrally concentrated than the total stellar population ( fig .",

    "the remaining six 70   sources are not near any known cluster members .",
    "we measured 70   fluxes for the eight point - sources with the aperture feature of _ imexamine _ in version 2.12.2 of iraf .",

    "better fits were obtained by excluding the 8   point , which is above the blue blackbody for all eight sources .",
    "to a lesser degree , the 5.8   point is also systematically brighter than the blue blackbody component , suggesting that there is a range of dust temperatures causing warm dust to radiate above the blackbody at 5.8   and perhaps also at 8  .",

    "is shown in figure  [ fig : galsed ] .",
    "we determined the flux by placing square apertures of roughly 45 @xmath1 50 on the galaxy and subtracting the median background .",
    "as with source 8 , the galaxy falls off of our irac coverage , so data from pid 132 is used to determine its irac fluxes .",
    "this sed is similar to the other eight , except that it lacks the slight excess emission at 5.8   that many of the other sources exhibit .",
    "the cold dust component of the blackbody fits for the eight unidentified sources range in temperature from @xmath1150  k to 68  k  a temperature commensurate with these objects being post - thermal pulse stars , stars suffering from episodic mass loss on the rgb , or post - agb stars .",
    "however , the temperatures of all eight sources are also consistent with dust in star forming regions that dominate the galactic far - ir emission . at a temperature of 48.8 @xmath31 0.8  k , the cold blackbody component of the resolved galaxy is colder than the other eight 70   sources , which may suggest that the warmer sources are of a different nature .",
    "although , with so few constraints in the blackbody fits , one might argue that the temperatures of all nine sources are consistent with each other .",
    "if the 70   sources are dusty agb stars , the flux at 8   may be included in the wing of a broad emission feature centered at 9.5   due to amorphous silicate grains that overlaps with the irac 8   bandpass .",

    "sources 1 and 4 lie on the brighter end of the rgb , but they are blended with the aforementioned leid sources at the shorter wavelengths , which will cause an artificial increase in brightness . while near - ir redshift measurements or radial velocity measurements would conclusively determine the nature of these sources , analysis of the _ spitzer _ data strongly suggests that they are all background galaxies .      despite ongoing stellar mass loss in @xmath0cen , there are no known detections of any phase of icm material in the cluster .",
    "the wind velocities discussed in  [ sec : mlr ] are @xmath68 10 km s@xmath3 for metal - poor , dust - driven winds from low - mass agb stars .",
    "such velocities are much less than the escape velocity of @xmath0cen at 1 r@xmath69 ( @xmath70 @xmath17 44 km s@xmath3 ; * ? ? ?",

    "rgb and agb wind velocities measured from h@xmath71 emission wings can be as high as the cluster escape velocity , however it is likely that h@xmath71 wings are due to pulsation and/or chromospheric activity instead of the circumstellar shells of stars .",
    "core velocities originate in the chromospheres and are typically lower ( @xmath37 15 km s@xmath3 ) , but there have been at least two observations of high velocities from the ir line @xcite .",
    "if the winds are indeed slow and the total mass - loss rate discussed in  [ sec : mlr ] has been constant since the last galactic plane crossing , then , barring any icm removal mechanisms and assuming that all stars belong to the population with the lowest metallicity , 1  2 @xmath27 of material should have accumulated in the cluster .",
    "this mass estimate includes only dusty mass loss on the rgb and agb ; mass loss from non - dusty stars on the rgb and from stars that lose significant mass in such a brief period of time that it may easily have been missed ( e.g. , associated with the formation of a planetary nebula ) may cause this estimate to increase by a factor of two or three .",
    "based on the total amount of agb mass loss , which is the only source of dust , we expect a dust mass of @xmath72 = @xmath73 @xmath8 1  2 @xmath1 10@xmath53 @xmath27 of dust .",
    "since the estimate of the time since the last galactic plane crossing is a lower limit ( @xmath22 3.4 @xmath1 10@xmath60 yr ; * ? ? ?",
