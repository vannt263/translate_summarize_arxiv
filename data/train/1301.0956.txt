    "the quadrupole moments for the higher bandmembers are highly consistent between protons and neutrons and have the expected sign , but they gradually fall off from the rotational values , approaching zero for the @xmath92 bandmember .",

    "\\(3 ) to some extent in the quadrupole moments , but especially in the @xmath76 transition strengths for the @xmath31 bands [ fig .",
    "[ fig - be2-odd](a ) ] , one may observe that the @xmath2 matrix element strengths start at the expected rotational values for low @xmath19 but then systematically fall off below the rotational values at higher @xmath19 .",
    "this trend signals deviation from a strict _ adiabatic _ rotational picture , as described in sec .",

    "@xcite ] . in well - deformed rotor nuclei , this contribution is commonly ignored , on the presumption that @xmath105 is strongly enhanced while @xmath104 is of single - particle strength  @xcite .",
    "however , in light nuclei , where the collective enhancement is weaker , such a single - particle contribution may be expected to be nonnegligible in comparison , and to be of approximately the magnitude seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - be2-odd](a ) .",
    "the principal challenge in identifying collective structure in ncci calculations with realistic interactions lies in the weak convergence of the relevant observables .",

    "although it is possible to extrapolate the values of calculated observables to their values in the full , infinite space  @xcite , such methods are still in their formative stages , especially for the crucial @xmath2 observables .",
    "it is therefore particularly notable that quantitatively well - developed and robust signatures of rotation may be observed in the present results . that this is possible reflects the distinction between convergence of _ individual _ observables , taken singly , and convergence of _ relative _ properties , such as ratios of excitation energies or ratios of quadrupole matrix elements .",
