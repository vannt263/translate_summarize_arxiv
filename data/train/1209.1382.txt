    "incompatibility of two quantum observables means that they can not be implemented in a single measurement setup .",
    "the existence of incompatible observables is a genuine quantum phenomenon , and it is perhaps most notably manifested in various uncertainty relations .",
    "the best known examples of incompatible observables are the spin components in orthogonal directions and the canonical pair of position and momentum .",
    "most of the earlier studies on incompatibility have been concentrating on observables and effects ( see e.g.  @xcite for a survey ) . in this work",
    "we define the notion of incompatibility in a general way so that it becomes possible to speak about incompatibility of two different types of devices , e.g.  incompatibility of an observable and a channel , or an effect and an operation .",
    "our proposed definition is a straightforward generalization of the usual one for observables ; two devices are incompatible if they can not be parts of a single measurement setup .",
    "our approach provides the possibility to separate two qualitatively different levels of incompatibility .",
    "namely , we will define the concept of strong incompatibility and demonstrate that this is , indeed , more stringent condition than mere incompatibility .",
    "strongly incompatible devices can not be implemented on the same measurement setup even if we were allowed to change one of its specific parts , the pointer observable .",
    "it is illustrative to note some similarities between ( strong ) incompatibility and entanglement .",
    "typically , entanglement is defined through its negation  separability . in a similar way",
    ", incompatibility is defined through its negation  compatibility .",
    "it is easy to intuitively grasp the notions of separable states and compatible measurements , while entangled states and incompatible measurements are harder to comprehend .",
    "one of the best indication of a quantum regime , namely a violation of a bell inequality , requires both an entangled state and a collection of incompatible observables .",
    "our investigation is organized as follows . in section [ sec : incompatible - devices ] we define incompatibility and strong incompatibility using the property `` being part of an instrument '' as a starting point . in section [ sec : formulations ] we show that it is possible to formulate these relations in terms of stinespring and kraus representations .",
    "the connection of incompatibility and strong incompatibility to measurement models is explained in section [ sec : memo ] , and this clarifies the operational meaning of the relations . in section [ sec : examples ] we demonstrate all possible relations between operations and effects . in particular , it will become clear that strong incompatibility is a stricter relation than mere incompatibility .    to this end , let us fix the notation .",

    "relating the compatibility relations to measurement models illustrates an operational meaning of these notions in a simple way  compatibility of two devices is conditioned by a single measurement model for both devices , while for weak compatibility the two devices are required to have a single measurement model up to the pointer observable .",
