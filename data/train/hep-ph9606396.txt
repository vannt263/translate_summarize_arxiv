    "the central lesson which one begins to draw after any preliminary examination of the data coming from the four experiments at lep is that the standard model ( sm ) is in very good shape .",
    "in particular , some of the leptonic measurements at lep are showing agreement with the sm to nearly 1 part in 1000 , a level of accuracy unusual in high energy experiments .",
    "nonetheless there are two , by now well known , nagging discrepancies between the lep data and the sm , both in the @xmath5 hadronic decay branching fractions . defining @xmath6 , one has  @xcite : @xmath7 where the theoretical uncertainties are dominated by the uncertainty in the top quark mass , @xmath8 .",
    "there is thus a @xmath9 excess in @xmath0 and a @xmath10 deficit in @xmath1 .",
    "there are a number of plausible solutions to the current disagreement , not least of which is simple experimental error . @xmath0 alone can be corrected ( at least partially ) by low - energy supersymmetry ( susy)@xcite , but this has no bearing on @xmath1 .",
    "solutions have also been proposed in which new fermions mix with the sm fermion spectrum .",
    "the most attractive of these solutions proposes that the `` top '' quark observed at fnal is actually a new fourth generation @xmath11-quark , while the real @xmath12-quark ( defined to be the @xmath13 partner of the @xmath14-quark ) is hiding near the @xmath15 , @xmath16  @xcite ; this solution again does not affect @xmath1 .",
    "i propose instead an additional @xmath17 interaction whose corresponding gauge boson , @xmath18 , mixes with the usual @xmath15 , thereby changing the interactions of the @xmath15 with the sm fermions .",
    "specifically i will build realistic models in which the @xmath15-@xmath18 mixing can resolve both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 problems without upsetting the other lep observables ; and in particular i will show that there exists a model coming from @xmath4 which is phenomenologically acceptable .",
    "any realistic model of new physics which attempts to resolve the @xmath0 and @xmath1 anomalies must confront two difficulties .",
    "the first difficulty arises if one wants to assign interactions to the @xmath14 and @xmath19-quarks which are not generation - independent , , change the predictions for only @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in that case",
    "one would generically expect large flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc s ) through violation of the gim mechanism , particularly in the @xmath20-@xmath21 system .",
    "the solution may lie within the simple observations that , for @xmath22 , @xmath23 , consistent with zero , and that the total hadronic width at lep agrees well with the sm .",
    "such a pattern of shifts is indicative of a universally - coupled , generation - independent @xmath18-boson : @xmath24 by having generation - independent couplings , one does not violate the gim mechanism and no new large fcnc s are generated .",
    "we will therefore demand this generation - independence as the first of four principles we will require of any model we build .",
    "the second difficulty is that the leptonic data at lep is all very precisely measured , and in strong agreement with the sm .",
    "if the leptons are charged under @xmath17 then there should appear discrepancies in their partial widths of roughly the same size as those in the quark sector , an effect that is clearly not observed .",
    "thus we must demand that the @xmath17 charges of the leptons be zero ( or very small ) , leading us to name such interactions _",
    "leptophobic_. this leptophobia will be our second principle for model - building .    using a leptophobic @xmath2 to explain the @xmath0 and @xmath1 anomalies",
    "was shown to be phenomenologically viable in ref .  @xcite .",
    "though the authors did not build specific anomaly - free gauge models , there were able to show that the @xmath15-@xmath18 mixing arising in such a model could in principle explain the lep data .",
    "in contrast to  @xcite , the authors of  @xcite also attempted to explain a possible anomaly in the cdf jet cross - section at high @xmath25 .",
    "this added requirement led them to consider models which are very different than those considered here and in  @xcite : the `` models '' of  @xcite  have heavy ( @xmath26 ) @xmath18-bosons and are strongly coupled , while the models i am considering here have light ( @xmath27 ) @xmath18-bosons and are weakly coupled .",
    "we will impose two further constraints on the models we build , though these are slightly more prejudical .",
    "we will require that all new matter which is added to the model ( , for anomaly cancellation ) be vector - like under the sm gauge groups .",
    "this means that the new matter will all receive masses at the scale of the @xmath17 breaking , which is presumably above the weak scale .",
    "we also require that the sm gauge couplings unify near @xmath28 , a behavior expected in grand unified ( gut ) and string theories and observed in the minimal susy model ( mssm ) .",
    "this will further restrict our new matter to come in complete multiplets of an ersatz @xmath29 ( it is ersatz because the @xmath29 need not commute with @xmath17 ) .    under the conditions laid out above , we built models which fall into two broad classes  @xcite . in the first , there are models with extra matter whose charges have been chosen specifically to cancel the @xmath30 anomalies .",
    "such models could in principle derive from a string theory , but they do not have the attraction of coming from a simple gut group .",
    "the second class of models are models which do come from simple gut s . that such a model even exists seems at first improbable since gut s tend to place quarks and leptons in common representations , giving charges to quarks and leptons alike under the gut subgroups and ruining leptophobia .",
    "however i will explain in the remaining part of this talk just how , in one example , one can indeed get a leptophobic @xmath17 from a common gut group , namely @xmath4 .",
    "but to do so i must return to the basics of how two abelian gauge bosons can mix with one another .",
    "the most general lagrangian for the gauge sector of a @xmath31 theory can be written : @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the usual field strength tensors .",
    "two terms in this lagrangian are responsible for mixing the gauge bosons : there is the usual mass mixing @xmath36 which arises when the sm higgs fields are charged under the @xmath17 , and the kinetic mixing term @xmath37 which is allowed only because for abelian groups the field strengths are themselves gauge - invariant .    taking the lagrangian to its mass eigenbasis mixes the @xmath15 and @xmath18 fields into mass eigenstates , @xmath38 , where we identify @xmath39 with the @xmath5 at lep .",
    "one can think of going from the original basis to the physical basis as a two step process .",
    "first , a non - orthogonal transformation diagonalizes the gauge kinetic terms , followed by a rotation which diagonalizes the mass terms . in the first of the two transformations , one gets the unexpected result that the effective charge to which one of the two @xmath2 s couples is shifted .",
    "that is , in the interaction part of the lagrangian one replaces : @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the @xmath17 charge and hypercharge of @xmath43 .",
    "after the rotation , the mixing angle , @xmath44 , will depend both on @xmath45 and @xmath46 : @xmath47 and the interaction of @xmath39 with matter is given by : @xmath48\\psi_i \\label{eq : lagrangian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 .",
    "now , if one were to begin with a simple gut at some high scale , then at the scale at which @xmath50 , one has at tree level @xmath51",
    ". then where does a non - zero @xmath46 come from ?",
    "consider @xmath2 mixing induced by loops , with @xmath52 and @xmath53 on the external legs and charged matter running in the loop .",
    "the polarization tensor will have the form : @xmath54\\ ] ] for the @xmath55-th particle in the loop .",
    "this operator in turn generates a term in the lagrangian @xmath56 where we identify @xmath57 clearly if @xmath58 for degenerate particles then no mixing is induced , and this is often approximately true in gut s .",
    "however , if the sum is non - zero , then one can resum the logarithms in @xmath46 from the gut scale to the weak scale using the rge s .",
    "( the details of the rge s are found in ref .",
    "having developed the machinery for calculating @xmath2 kinetic mixing , let us now try it on a `` realistic '' gut group , namely @xmath4 .",
    "i will not try to argue here why @xmath4 is particularly worth studying , since i will assume that most people are aware of its many useful properties .",
    "for now i need only describe @xmath4 in so far as to note that @xmath59 , where the last two @xmath2 factors are not contained in the sm .",
    "we are considering for this study the simpler final gauge group @xmath30 , so we identify @xmath17 as an arbitrary admixture of the two extra @xmath2 s in @xmath4 : @xmath60 it is a simple exercise to show that no such combination of @xmath61 and @xmath62 is leptophobic and can thereby be a candidate for explaining the lep anomalies .",
    "( in fact , searches for the leptonic decays of the @xmath63 and @xmath64 gauge bosons place bounds on their masses above @xmath65 . )",
    "however , let us add a new term to our lagrangian , which for the time being will be simply a phenomenological parameter , namely a non - zero @xmath66 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) .",
    "we then fit all the lep data , including @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of the fitting prodecure ) to calculate @xmath67 likelihoods for the fits at each choice of @xmath68 .",
    "the result , expressed as 95% confidence levels are : @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( the sm is excluded at @xmath71 in this fit ) .",
    "what is remarkable is that the fit has picked out a very particular subgroup of @xmath4 called the @xmath3-model in which @xmath72 . among the experimentally interesting characteristics of the @xmath3-model",
    "is that the anomalies of @xmath73 cancel if and only if entire * 27 * s of @xmath4 live at or below the @xmath74 breaking scale , which is presumably near the weak scale .",
    "thus large numbers of new particles are expected at scales not very far above a few hundred gev .",
    "and the reason that the @xmath3-model worked is that the combination @xmath75 vanishes for sm leptons ; that is , the @xmath3-model with @xmath76 is leptophobic !    = 2.5 in    getting a realistic spectrum which will generate dynamically @xmath77 through the rge s is not necessarily possible . in fact , it turns out that there are very few ways in which one can extend the @xmath3-model and keep it perturbative up to the gut scale ; however , one of these extensions ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) can generate a value of @xmath78 , within the 95% bounds given above , providing a clear example of dynamical leptophobia .    in figure",
    "[ fig ] , i show the 95% and 99% c.l . bounds for the @xmath78 @xmath3-model in the plane of @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the contribution to the @xmath81-parameter due to @xmath15-@xmath18 mixing and @xmath82 is a rescaled @xmath15-@xmath18 mixing angle . cutting across the ellipses of constant @xmath67 are contours of the @xmath83 mass .",
    "rather interestingly , we find that the @xmath3-model predicts rather light @xmath83 : at 95% , @xmath84 ( at 99% c.l",
    ". the mass approaches the lep @xmath5 mass ) .",
    "traditional methods for searching for and excluding @xmath83 candidates are clearly untenable here .",
    "one usually produces new gauge bosons through their interactions with hadrons , but observes their decays through leptons ; this decay channel is simply far too small for a leptophobic model . and",
    "although the @xmath83 will decay to jets , those jets are overwhelmed by qcd backgrounds .",
    "to date the best bounds on @xmath85 come from the ua2 collaboration which was unable to rule out any significant portion of the mass / coupling range considered here .",
    "it has also been suggested  @xcite  that the @xmath83 could be observed in associated production with a sm gauge boson , with @xmath86 ; here signals and backgrounds are small , but the ratio is close to one .",
    "finally , it has been realized that low - energy experiments might provide a strong bound on these extra @xmath15 models  @xcite . in particular",
    ", @xmath87 scattering and atomic parity experiments can provide an additional window on @xmath15-@xmath18 mixing .",
    "for example , the weak charge of cesium is already @xmath88 below the sm value , while the leptophobic models discussed here all tend to worsen the disagreement .",
    "however , it is easy to see that in the limit @xmath89 , all @xmath83 contributions to both low - energy extractions fall to zero , leaving only the sm prediction .",
    "( this is because both processes require a leptonic coupling at one vertex . )",
    "thus , we are surprised to learn that not only is a light ( @xmath90 ) @xmath83 allowed , but it might even be preferred !      k.  babu , c.  kolda and j.  march - russell , iassns - hep-96/20 , hep - ph/9603212 , _ phys .",
