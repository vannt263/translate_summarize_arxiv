    "in this paper we study the way that heegaard genus behaves when one glues two manifolds @xmath7 and @xmath8 together along annuli or tori in their boundary to obtain a new manifold @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , we ask how low the heegaard genus of @xmath9 can be compared to the heegaard genera of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "this is a questions which is easy to ask but difficult to answer , and it has received a great deal of attention . + it is a well known result of haken s @xcite that every heegaard surface in a connected sum @xmath10 ( which can be regarded as a gluing along spheres ) arises naturally as the connected sum of heegaard surfaces @xmath11 and @xmath12 for @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , and thus @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes heegaard genus .",
    "the same can be said for boundary connect sums @xmath15 , which is an attachment of @xmath7 to @xmath8 along disks in their boundary .",
    "however , as soon as we make the leap to gluings along surfaces of non - positive euler characteristic , the situation becomes more complicated and the volume of literature on the subject is large .",
    "we briefly touch on a few developments that are of relevance to our work here , without making any claim to completeness .",
    "+ in the case that @xmath7 and @xmath8 are glued together along closed genus @xmath16 surfaces in their boundary , it is easy to see that @xmath17 because one can simply amalgamate any generalized heegaard splitting induced by heegaard splittings of @xmath7 and @xmath8 . a great deal of results have been published which give conditions on the gluing map that ensure that such splittings are the only minimal genus splittings of @xmath9 , so that this upper bound is actually attained .",
    "scharlemann and tomova s paper @xcite is a good early example of the combinatorial approach , lackenby s elegant paper @xcite is a good example of the geometric approach to this problem , and there are many , many more recent papers on the subject which are too numerous to name here .",
    "+ on the other hand , it is often the case that heegaard genus will be much lower .",
    "for example , if we let @xmath7 be a handlebody , and @xmath8 be the closure of the complement of a regular neighborhood of a graph in @xmath5 , we see that it is also possible to have a situation where @xmath18 .",
    "lower bounds on @xmath19 have been found , however .",
    "important examples include those found by schultens @xcite , lei and yang @xcite , and derby - talbot@xcite , and the latter s main theorem has hypotheses which correspond closely to the hypotheses of the main theorem here . as far as existence is concerned , in the more restrictive case that the gluing occurs along a pair of _ incompressible _ tori , schultens and wiedmann have found examples where @xmath20 , and more specifically @xmath21 .",
    "+ the extensive literature on the behavior of tunnel number of knots in @xmath5 under connected sum also falls under our umbrella here ( moriah s survey @xcite is a good place to start ) .",
    "the tunnel number of knot @xmath22 can be defined by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the exterior of @xmath22 , and @xmath25 is the annular sum of @xmath26 and @xmath27 along meridional annuli .",
    "here it is not difficult to see that @xmath28 , and analogously to the case of gluings along closed surfaces , a great deal of work has gone into showing that this bound can be acheived and the circumstances under which it is . here",
    "papers by moriah and rubinstein @xcite , morimoto sakuma and yokota @xcite , and kobayashi and rieck @xcite are a few of the earlier papers establishing existence , and each uses a distinct approach .",
    "the work of kobayashi and rieck in particular plays an important role in the construction of our links in section 6 below .",
    "+ on the lower end , the first example of a pair of knots in @xmath5 for which @xmath29 was found by morimoto @xcite , and kobayashi @xcite soon after found that the difference @xmath30 can be made arbitrarily large .",
    "lower bounds on subadditivity were found by schultens and scharlemann @xcite@xcite , and @xcite in particular is of interest to us here , because there lower bounds are established on the _ degeneration ratio _ of two ( or more ) knots , defined by the formula @xmath31 scharlemann and schultens found that @xmath32 for any prime knots @xmath3 and @xmath4 in @xmath5 , and in the case that @xmath25 admits a strongly irreducible minimal genus heegaard splitting , @xmath33 . + in the following paper , our main goal is to prove lower bounds on subadditivity of heegaard genus under toroidal and annular gluings .",
    "section 2 is devoted to setting down notation , definitions , and foundational propositions which the expert will find familiar .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the development of what might be called substitution machinery , and plays an essential in the proof of section 4 .",
    "+ the main result of this paper is proved in section 4 .",
    "it shows that if @xmath9 is obtained by gluing @xmath7 to @xmath8 along a pair of incompressible tori @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and if @xmath9 admits a minimal genus heegaard surface @xmath36 which nicely ( in the sense of satisfying properties a and b of section 4 ) intersects the incompressible torus @xmath37 which is the image of @xmath38 and @xmath39 after gluing , then @xmath40 .",
    "the examples of schultens and wiedmann show this bound to be best possible . the philosophical approach the proof is simple ,",
    "although its execution is a bit technical .",
    "the idea is that , under sufficiently nice circumstances , the surface @xmath41 will cut @xmath8 into compression bodies , and in a nice pattern .",
    "we then take a close look at this pattern and create a simpler _ doppelgnger _",
    "surface @xmath42 properly embedded in the solid torus @xmath43 which cuts it into handlebodies and also has a pattern corresponding to the one left by @xmath41 in @xmath8 .",
    "we then attach @xmath43 to @xmath7 instead of @xmath8 , and in such a way that @xmath42 matches up nicely with @xmath44 after the gluing to form a closed heegaard surface @xmath45 in @xmath46 of genus less than or equal to @xmath36 . after removing a core of @xmath43",
    "we get back @xmath7 , and after at most one stabilization of @xmath45 , we obtain a heegaard splitting of the desired kind . + in section 5 we give applications of the main theorem . in the case",
    "when @xmath9 is obtained by a toroidal gluing of @xmath7 and @xmath8 along what we have called an @xmath47-incongruous gluing map , we show that @xmath48 .",
    "the @xmath49 term arises , as opposed to the @xmath50 of the general theorem , due to a lack of control over precisely which slope a heegaard surface might intersect the gluing torus .",
    "the main result is then applied with better force to the case of a connected sum between knots , which can be interpreted as a very special form of toroidal gluing that allows us to control the slope in which heegaard surfaces intersect the gluing torus . here",
    "we deduce that @xmath51 when either of @xmath3 or @xmath4 is @xmath6-small , or whenever a minimal genus heegaard splitting of @xmath52 can be made to intersect the decomposing annulus of the connected sum essentially . the latter assumption is always realized when @xmath25 admits a strongly irreducible minimal genus splitting .",
    "+ section 6 is then devoted to small observations and conjectures which we believe likely to be attainable using methods similar to those employed here .",
    "it also contains a construction of an interesting class of examples of manifolds whose heegaard genus persistently decreases under toroidal gluing .",
    "specifically for all @xmath53 we construct @xmath16-component links @xmath54 , @xmath16 knots @xmath55 in @xmath5 , and homeomorphisms @xmath56 such that @xmath57 , where @xmath58 . and in fact it is easy to see that if the gluing is performed in sequence , so that @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and more generally @xmath61 , then @xmath62 .",
    "this does not improve the result of schultens and wiedmann .",
    "it is distinct from their examples , which use seifert fibered spaces where we use non - trivial , non - torus link complements in @xmath5 , although it is similar because both constructions utilize bridge spheres of the knots @xmath63 in the same fashion .",
