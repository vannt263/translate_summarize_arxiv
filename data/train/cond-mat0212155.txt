    "the superconductivity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 was discovered in 1994.@xcite shortly after the discovery of superconductivity , a possible triplet p - wave superconductivity with the following order parameter was postulated by rice and sigrist.@xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the magnitude of the superconducting order parameter . here",
    "@xmath6-vector is called spin vector perpendicular to the direction of the the spin associated with the condensed pair.@xcite notice that this state is analogous to the @xmath7 phase of @xmath8he and there is a full gap on the fermi surface .",
    "subsequently , the triplet superconducting nature has been confirmed by the constancy of @xmath9o knight shift ( spin susceptibility ) through @xmath10 for the magnetic field parallel to the @xmath11 plane@xcite .",
    "the broken time reversal symmetry state have been also confirmed by the spontaneous magnetic moment found in @xmath12sr experiment@xcite . in general ,",
    "the triplet superconductors have a variety of collective modes .",
    "the spin waves and the clapping mode with the order parameter of eq .",
    "[ p - wave ] were studied in ref . @xcite .",
    "further , the effect of the clapping mode on the sound wave was studied.@xcite however , this coupling is very small to detect the existence of the clapping mode .    in the meantime ,",
    "the sample quality of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 has been improved .",
    "the cleanest sample shows the transition temperature close to the optimal @xmath13 deduced from the @xmath10 dependence of the residual resistivity.@xcite all these high quality samples exhibit the character of nodal superconductors ; the @xmath14 behavior of the specific heat@xcite , the @xmath15-linear dependence of superfluid density@xcite , the @xmath16 behavior of @xmath17 in nmr@xcite , the @xmath14 behavior of the ultrasonic attenuation@xcite , and the @xmath18 dependence of the specific heat in a magnetic field@xcite at low temperature .",
    "these low temperature behaviors of the specific heat and superfluid density are consistent with a f - wave superconductor with nodes in the order parameter.@xcite    on the other hand , the quasi - two dimensional system with strong paramagnon ( the ferromagnetic spin fluctuation ) favors the p - wave superconductor as given in eq .",
    "[ p - wave].@xcite in order to understand this situation , the nodal structure of the order parameter becomes of crucial importance . in a series of papers ,",
    "won and maki have shown that the magneto - thermal conductivity for @xmath19 will provide the direct access to this question@xcite , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the anisotropic fermi velocities .",
    "such experiments have been carried out by tanatar _",

    "the better test of the nodal position can be done through the angle ( azimuthal angle of @xmath31 from the @xmath32-axis ) dependence of the thermal conductivity@xcite .",
    "more recently , deguchi et al observed a double transition in the specific heat with the magnetic field near @xmath33 , and this experimental result was interpreted in terms of multigap model.@xcite on the other hand , the behavior of the specific heat and the magnetic penetration depth for low temperature @xmath34 and the low field @xmath35 appears to be consistent with the f - wave order parameter given in eq .",

    "the clapping mode is the fluctuation of the order parameter which can be written as @xmath54 in the nambu space , as it is indicated in the fluctuation of the order parameter , @xmath55 , this mode can directly couple to @xmath37 and @xmath38 channels of the raman spectra .",
    "the clapping mode makes the additional contribution to the raman intensity given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the coupling constant which mediates superconducting state , and the coupling between the fluctuation of the order parameter and the light scattering with raman vertex , @xmath41 . on the other hand",
