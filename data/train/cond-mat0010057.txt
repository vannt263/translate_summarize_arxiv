    "the dynamics of excited electrons at metal surfaces plays a key role in understanding basic processes like chemical reactions at surfaces and transient magnetization effects on a femtosecond time - scale . while this time regime is now accessible by ultrashort laser pulse pump - probe techniques , which for example allow to determine the occupation time of the intermediate level with high precision , the detailed interpretation of such results has generated considerable controversy .",
    "the underlying problem is easily recognized : the observed energy relaxation times do not represent the lifetime of a single excited electron , but result from a convolution of several complex and not yet well understood occupation / decay - channels like capture of time - delayed secondary electrons and removal of electrons by ballistic transport out of the region probed experimentally .",
    "therefore a basic understanding of all steps involved is required .",
