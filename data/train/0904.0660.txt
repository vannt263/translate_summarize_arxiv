    "magnetic reconnection is a fundamental physical process of topological rearrangement of magnetic field lines in magnetized plasmas during which magnetic energy is converted into kinetic and thermal energy .",
    "reconnection is of particular importance in the solar atmosphere , the earth s magnetosphere , and in laboratory plasmas  @xcite . in hot plasmas , because of the low electrical resistivity , magnetic reconnection due to resistive dissipation alone is very slow . as a result , a simple single - fluid mhd description of the plasma is generally believed to be insufficient for the theoretical explanation of fast reconnection events . instead , a two - fluid mhd approach has been frequently used in recent studies of fast reconnection  @xcite .",

    "( [ j_o_fast])([l_fast ] ) essentially coincide with the results obtained in  @xcite for an electron mhd ( emhd ) reconnection model .",
    "note that the value of @xmath115 or , alternatively , the value of the proton acceleration rate @xmath116 at the point  @xmath45 can not be determined exactly .",

    "thus , both fast collisionless and slow sweet - parker reconnection regimes can exist simultaneously , as found in simulations  @xcite .",
    "these simulations also found a hysteresis for transition between slow and fast reconnection regimes .",
    "this implies that the transition hall regime , during which the electron layer length @xmath114 decreases , may occur at lundquist numbers other than @xmath146 , depending on the past history .",
    "unfortunately , our stationary model can not describe time - dependent transition processes .",
    "it is known that the single - fluid mhd reconnection becomes much faster when resistivity @xmath15 is anomalously enhanced by current - driven plasma instabilities  @xcite .",
    "( [ ez_fast ] ) shows that resistivity enhancement can considerably increase the collisionless reconnection rate as well .",
    "this enhancement can occur after the electric current value ( @xmath76 ) jumps up during the transition from the sweet - parker to the collisionless regime at @xmath145 , and could be a physical mechanism of very fast reconnection .",
    "let us compare theoretical results  ( [ j_o_fast])([bz_xy_fast ] ) for collisionless reconnection with numerical simulations and experiment .",
    "the estimates @xmath138 for the proton layer thickness , @xmath167 for the electron layer thickness , @xmath168 for the quadrupole field , and @xmath169 for the electron outflow velocity agree with simulations  @xcite .",
    "the estimates @xmath138 and @xmath170 also agree with experiment  @xcite . however , the experimentally measured electron layer thickness is about eight times larger than the model and simulations predict  @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional geometry effects and plasma instabilities make direct comparison and exact interpretation of the experimental results difficult  @xcite .",
    "our theoretical results are qualitatively consistent with recent numerical findings of an inner electron dissipation layer and of electron outflow jets that extend into the proton layer  @xcite .",
    "the electron layer length @xmath171 decreases with the electron mass , as in simulations  @xcite , but the scaling law observed in these simulations was slightly different , @xmath172 .",
    "length @xmath173 is generally much larger than both @xmath167 and @xmath138 , consistent with simulations  @xcite . however , if resistivity @xmath15 becomes anomalous and enhanced over the spitzer value so much that @xmath174 , then @xmath114 can theoretically become of order of @xmath132 , as in simulations  @xcite . our theoretical results for the proton velocity @xmath175 agree with simulations  @xcite , which found the proton outflow velocity to be significantly less than @xmath176 and also found acceleration of protons in the decelerating electron jets .",
    "unfortunately , detailed quantitative comparison of our results to the results of kinetic numerical simulations is hindered because the simulations do not explicitly specify resistivity @xmath15 .",
    "also , in the simulations the electron pressure tensor anisotropy was found to play a critical role inside the electron layer and jets  @xcite , while in this study an isotropic pressure is assumed and the electrons are coupled to the field lines inside the electron outflow jets .",
