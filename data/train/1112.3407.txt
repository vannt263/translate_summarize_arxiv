    "the general philosophy of the lattice approach to lcfts in the boundary case @xcite relies on the analysis of microscopic models  typically spin chains built out of alternating representations of a super lie algebra such as @xmath12 , with a nearest neighbour  heisenberg \" coupling  as a bi - module over two algebras . in physical terms ,",

    "we stress that the inner product is indefinite because of the sign factors in the relations  .",

    "it was also shown that the hamiltonian has non - trivial jordan cells ( of rank - two ) .      as was mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "an important step in our approach is to find a decomposition of the spin - chain over the @xmath1 for any finite @xmath5 .",
    "the representation @xmath21 of @xmath1 is non - faithful and there are thus no direct evident ways of getting the decomposition of the spin - chain , unlike in the open case where one deals with a faithful representation of @xmath15 .",
    "for example , the general theory  @xcite of projective modules over a cellular algebra ( which includes @xmath85 and @xmath18 algebras ) could be applied in a faithful representation . in our non - faithful case , we need an indirect strategy , which uses the symmetry algebra as discussed below . in turn , the use of this indirect strategy is made complicated by the fact that we deal with the non semi - simple representation of an associative algebra .",
    "our problem is thus rather complicated .    in general , an important concept in lattice models",
    "is the full symmetry algebra which is technically the centralizer of a ",
    "hamiltonian densities \" algebra of the model . by the latter algebra",

    "the representation theory of the centralizer @xmath90 is usually much easier to study than the representation theory of the  hamiltonian densities \" algebra @xmath45 .",
    "it is thus more reasonable to start with a decomposition of spin - chains over @xmath90 into indecomposable direct summands , which are in general what are technically called tilting modules  @xcite .",
    "note here that strictly speaking the tilting modules are defined for a quasi - hereditary algebra , which is the case for the centralizers of the tl algebras , and for jtl representations in closed alternating @xmath91 spin chains only if @xmath92 .",
    "so for the @xmath0 closed case the  spin - chain modules \" are not tilting , though we will sometimes still call them  tilting \" , abusing notations ( the concept of tilting modules is very powerful and will be used for studying @xmath93 spin chains in forthcoming papers , see also  @xcite for a short review in the context of boundary spin chains . )",
    "the next step is to study all homomorphisms between the direct summands in the decomposition to obtain the module structure over the `` hamiltonian densities '' algebra @xmath45 . in particular , multiplicities in front of tilting @xmath90-modules",

    "one gets a sequence of bi - modules @xmath94 over the two commuting algebras parametrized by the number @xmath5 of sites / tensorands in the spin - chain .",

    "this property , which holds in the semi - simple case , is not obvious for non - semisimple representations of an associative algebra @xmath45 , and in fact does not hold in our case .",
