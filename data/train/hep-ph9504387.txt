    "in this paper we are interested in finding the `` reach '' of the @xmath0 factories in terms of determining the angles of the standard model ( sm ) ckm matrix , and of limiting `` new physics '' contributions . within these future limits on both models ,",
    "we then make predictions for other experiments , including @xmath15 , @xmath7 , and the asymmetry in @xmath16 mixing , which is almost null in the sm . in setting limits we use the method of a joint @xmath3 fit to all constraining experiments .",
    "the `` new physics '' class of models we use are those with extra iso - singlet down quarks , where we take only one new down quark as mixing significantly .",
    "an example is e@xmath9 , where there are two down quarks for each generation with only one up quark , and of which we assume only one new iso - singlet down quark mixes strongly .",
    "this model has shown large possible effects in @xmath11 mixing phases .",
    "the `` reach '' of the @xmath0 factory in this model also sets limits on the phases of the mixing angles to the new iso - singlet down quark . for different @xmath17",
    "we find multiple regions that will require experiments on @xmath14 or @xmath7 to decide between , and experiments on both could be required to effectively bound out or to verify the model .",
    "we also find a relatively small @xmath18 mixing asymmetry , even outside the standard model .",
    "groups such as @xmath19 with extra su@xmath20 singlet down quarks give rise to flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) through the mixing of four or more down quarks @xcite .",
    "we use the @xmath21 down quark mixing matrix @xmath22 which diagonalizes the initial down quarks ( @xmath23 ) to the mass eigenstates ( @xmath24 ) by @xmath25 .",
    "the flavor changing neutral currents we have are @xcite @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "these fcnc with tree level @xmath10 mediated exchange may contribute part of @xmath29 mixing and of @xmath30 mixing , giving a range of non - zero values for the fourth quark s mixing parameters .",
    "@xmath29 mixing may occur by the @xmath31 quarks in a @xmath32 annihilating to a virtual @xmath33 through a fcnc with amplitude @xmath34 , and the virtual @xmath33 then creating @xmath35 quarks through another fcnc , again with amplitude @xmath36 , which then becomes a @xmath37 meson .",
    "if these are a large contributor to the @xmath38 mixing , they introduce three new mixing angles and two new phases into the @xmath8 violating @xmath0 decay asymmetries .",
    "the size of the contribution of the fcnc amplitude @xmath36 as one side of the unitarity quadrangle is less than 0.1 of the unit base @xmath39 at the 1-@xmath40 level , but we have found @xcite that it can contribute , at present , as large an amount to @xmath41 mixing as does the standard model .",
