    "the advent of semiconducting quantum dots has stimulated in recent years a remarkable renewal of interest in the kondo effect  @xcite , a central paradigm of condensed matter science more traditionally associated with bulk systems  @xcite . at its simplest",
    "the classic spin - kondo effect arises  @xcite , a single spin in an odd - electron dot being quenched by coupling to the low - energy degrees of freedom of the conduction electrons in a metallic lead ; as manifest strikingly in e.g.  the unitarity limit for the zero - bias conductance at low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "there is naturally considerable interest in coupled quantum dots at present , notably double dot ( dqd ) systems which are under active investigation both theoretically [ 6 - 18 ] and experimentally [ 19 - 27 ] .",
    "in addition to their possible utility in mesoscopic devices , circuitry and information processing , such systems offer the prospect of novel strongly correlated electron states , reflecting the inherent relevance of both spin _ and _ orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "probably the simplest dqd system is that in which two equivalent semiconducting dots , each in effect consisting of a single level and separately connected to their own leads / conduction channels , are mutually coupled by a capacitive interaction embodied in an _ _",
    "inter__dot interaction @xmath0 in addition to the usual intradot interaction @xmath1 .",
    "the dqd itself can contain up to @xmath9 electrons , controlled by varying the dot levels ( e.g.  by application of suitable gate voltages ) .",
    "the problem has been studied quite extensively in the @xmath10-electron sector  @xcite , where the degenerate dqd states @xmath11 and @xmath12 dominate and lead to a beautiful example of the @xmath5 kondo effect involving spin and orbital degrees of freedom  @xcite .    in the present paper by contrast",
    "we report an in - depth study of the @xmath13-electron regime , and its evolution as the ratio @xmath2 of interdot to intradot interaction strengths is increased .",
    "we uncover a rich range of physical behaviour , qualitatively quite distinct from the @xmath10 sector .",
    "for @xmath14 the dots are obviously uncoupled , the dqd states @xmath15 dominate and the normal spin - kondo effect ( @xmath4 ) prevails . that essential behaviour is found to persist on increasing @xmath2 , until close to @xmath16 where we find a rapid but continuous crossover to the @xmath5 kondo state occurring at @xmath16 . here",
    "the six dqd states @xmath17 and @xmath18 are degenerate , the spin and charge degrees of freedom are entangled , and the characteristic low - energy kondo scale is markedly enhanced .",
    "on increasing @xmath2 just beyond the @xmath5 point the system then enters a charge - kondo state , likewise a fermi liquid state , where a charge pseudospin arising from the dqd states @xmath19 and @xmath18 is kondo quenched on coupling to the conduction channels .",
    "that kondo quenching is however fragile : for only a small increase in @xmath2 the charge - pseudospin tunneling is suppressed , the associated kondo scale collapses rapidly but continuously , and the system undergoes a kosterlitz - thouless quantum phase transition at a critical @xmath7 from the fermi liquid phase to a charge ordered phase , a broken - symmetry non - fermi liquid state with @xmath20 residual entropy reflecting the degenerate , unquenched @xmath19 and @xmath18 dqd configurations .",
    "here we study the problem using wilson s numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) approach  @xcite as the natural method of choice .",
    "a preliminary account of some of the results has been given in a recent letter  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "the model is introduced in section  [ sec : model ] , and the essential steps of the nrg procedure for it are outlined in section  [ sec : nrg ] .",
    "rg fixed points , their stability and flows between them in different parameter regimes , are discussed in section  [ sec : fixedpoints ] , with particular attention given to the charge ordered ( co ) fixed point that controls the co phase . in section  [ sec : fpa ] a number of analytical results are obtained by considering how the leading corrections to the two stable fixed points , strong coupling ( sc ) and co , affect flows in their vicinity . for the sc phase in particular we consider the static spin susceptibility , uniform and staggered charge susceptibilities , and the linear coefficient of specific heat ; and obtain a number of exact results for associated wilson ratios .",
    "numerical results are presented in section  [ sec : numrestherm ] .",
    "we begin by establishing the phase diagram in the ( @xmath8)-plane , together with the evolution of the kondo scale in the various regimes of the sc phase .",
    "detailed results for the @xmath21-dependence of static properties are then given , notably the ` impurity ' entropy , spin- and charge - susceptibilities .",
    "the important issues of scaling and universality in the sc phase are likewise considered .",
    "results for ( and issues relating to ) single - particle dynamics and the linear differential conductance , will be given in a subsequent paper  @xcite .",
    "we model the capacitively coupled double dot system by a pair of correlated anderson impurities , connected additionally by an interimpurity coulomb interaction @xmath0 as shown schematically in . in standard notation , the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the number operator for dot @xmath25 ( referring to the ` left ' and ` right ' leads / channels ) .",
    "the first two terms of @xmath26 describe the isolated lead and dot levels respectively , while the third term contains the one - electron hopping processes between each dot and its associated lead .",
    "@xmath27 contains the interaction terms that render the problem non - trivial ; here we include both an intradot coulomb repulsion @xmath1 between the @xmath28- and @xmath29-spin electrons on each dot , and the interdot @xmath0 that embodies the capacitive coupling of the l and r channels .",
    "schematic representation of the double dot system , height=113 ]    when @xmath3 , the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hnought],_b _ ) is simply a doubled version of the single - impurity anderson model , the spin - kondo physics of which is now well - understood @xcite . as we show in due course , the additional interdot correlations introduced by @xmath30 tend to disfavour this spin - kondo behaviour , leading to more complex states in which both spin and orbital degrees - of - freedom can be important .",
    "it is for example easy to show that when @xmath6 the model maps onto the @xmath5 anderson model @xcite @xmath31 with spin and channel indices combined into a single quantity @xmath32 .",
    "the behaviour at this @xmath5 point is certainly quite different from the @xmath33 spin - kondo physics of @xmath3 ( albeit that the associated stable fixed points are fundamentally of the same type in this case ) , and one would like to understand how the system evolves between the two with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the situation beyond @xmath6 is also of considerable interest : here one naturally expects charge degrees - of - freedom to become more important than spin , as indeed will be seen vividly throughout this paper .    to obtain a rough idea of its parameter regimes , it is first convenient to look at the model in the ` atomic ' limit ( @xmath34 , where the dots are disconnected from the leads ) . here",
    "the isolated dot hamiltonian is @xmath35\\sum_{i = l , r}{\\hat n}_{i\\uparrow}{\\hat n}_{i\\downarrow}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath36 the total dqd number operator . for fixed interactions @xmath1 and @xmath0 , consider progressively lowering the energies of the dot levels @xmath37 ( via e.g.  a suitable gate voltage )",
    ". with increasing @xmath38 , the total ground - state occupancy of the dots takes the form of the familiar coulomb - blockade ` staircase ' , the occupancy increasing stepwise from @xmath10 to @xmath9 .",
    "the points of discontinuity in the staircase correspond of course to degeneracy of the @xmath39- and @xmath40-occupied configurations , and are easily shown to lie at @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath10 sector of the full dqd hamiltonian ( [ eq : hnought],_b _ ) has been studied previously @xcite . in this paper by contrast we focus on the @xmath13 regime , @xmath44 , and the rich range of physical behaviour arising therein .",
    "in particular we consider the midpoint , @xmath45 , at which the model is particle - hole symmetric ; stressing at the outset that the @xmath46-symmetric point is generically representative of the @xmath13 regime ( movement away from the symmetric point simply generates potential scattering in the two leads , of both equal sign and magnitude , and does not alter the essential physics of the problem ) .    with @xmath47",
    "henceforth , there remains of course the whole of the ( @xmath8 ) plane to explore . in the atomic limit , this is clearly divided by the line @xmath6 . for any non - zero @xmath1 ,",
    "the two electrons occupy different dots in the ground - state when @xmath48 , but share the same dot when @xmath49 ; i.e.  labelling the states by their individual dot occupation numbers @xmath50 , the ground state is @xmath51 for @xmath48 , but @xmath19 or @xmath18 for @xmath49 , as follows directly from ( [ eq : ddot2 ] ) . a quantum phase transition , albeit of a rather trivial kind",
    ", thus occurs in the atomic limit .",
    "but does a non - trivial quantum phase transition arise when the dots are connected to their leads ? in the remainder of the paper we answer this , and associated questions , by analysing the model within the powerful framework of the nrg @xcite .",
    "the nrg procedure for the dqd system is naturally quite similar to that of the single - impurity anderson model .",
    "we thus refer the reader to @xcite for further details , but outline the essential steps here in order to point out the differences that arise when the impurities are connected to two conduction bands .",
    "following section ii of @xcite , this transformation of the hamiltonian can be divided into three main steps .    1 .",
    "one defines a new set of conduction - band operators @xmath52 , in terms of which the hamiltonian takes a one - dimensional , continuum form .",
    "each of the leads is assumed to consist of a single flat band , with density - of - states @xmath53 and bandwidth @xmath54 .",
    "the natural lead - dot hybridization parameter is then the quantity @xmath55 , and the dqd hamiltonian becomes + @xmath56 2 .",
    "both conduction bands are then divided symmetrically about @xmath57 into logarithmic intervals , the @xmath39th of which ( for @xmath58 ) spans the range @xmath59 .",
    "only a single conduction - band state from each interval  the fully symmetric linear combination  couples to the impurity .",
    "all other conduction band states are neglected at this stage .",
    "3 .   finally , one performs a unitary transformation of the conduction - band states , to write each lead as a simple linear chain .",
    "the transformation is chosen such that only one site from each chain couples to the corresponding dot , by defining the annihilation operator for this site as @xmath60 the remaining sites in each chain are described by operators @xmath61 ( with somewhat more complicated expansions in terms of the @xmath62s , see @xcite ) , and the hamiltonian thus takes the form @xmath63\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{eq : hdiscdef } + \\frac{1}{d}\\sum_{i}(\\epsilon{\\hat n}_{i } + u{\\hat n}_{i\\uparrow}{\\hat n}_{i\\downarrow})+\\frac{u'}{d}{\\hat n}_{l}{\\hat n}_{r}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64^{1/2}$ ] ( with @xmath65 for @xmath66 ) .      as originally discussed in @xcite , an accurate description of the ground state",
    "can not be obtained simply by diagonalising a truncated version of the linear - chain hamiltonian ( [ eq : hdiscdef ] ) .",
    "this is because the most important conduction band states at low - temperatures ( those near the fermi level ) map onto the @xmath61 sites with the largest values of @xmath39 . to determine the true nature of the ground state",
    ", it is necessary to retain _ all _ conduction - band chain sites ; this is achieved in practice by using an iterative procedure to diagonalize the hamiltonian .",
    "the first step is to write ( [ eq : hdiscdef ] ) as @xmath67 where the @xmath68-site hamiltonian @xmath69 is itself given by @xmath70\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{eq : hndef } + \\lambda^{(n-1)/2)}\\left[\\sum_{i}(\\bar\\epsilon{\\hat n}_{i } + \\bar u{\\hat n}_{i\\uparrow}{\\hat n}_{i\\downarrow})+\\bar u'{\\hat n}_{l}{\\hat n}_{r}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with dimensionless coupling constants @xmath71 the key point here is that @xmath69 satisfies the recursion relation @xmath72 equation ( [ eq : recurdef ] ) has the status of an rg transformation , and lies at the heart of the approach @xcite .",
    "this recursion relation could in principle be implemented directly , by diagonalizing @xmath73 in the direct - product basis of the states of @xmath69 and the 16 states obtained by placing electrons in the @xmath74th orbitals of the two chains . in practice , however , the computation time required for the diagonalization of @xmath73 is greatly reduced by making use of its symmetries . as the coupling between the dots is purely capacitive ,",
    "it is readily shown that @xmath69 commutes with the individual charge operators for the l / r subsystems @xmath75 and also the left- and right - hand total spin operators @xmath76 where @xmath77 denotes the pauli matrices .",
    "it is thus possible to label each eigenstate of @xmath69 using seven quantum numbers , i.e. @xmath78 ; where @xmath79 and @xmath80 represent respectively the magnitude and @xmath81-component of spin on side @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) , and the index @xmath84 labels the different states of each charge and spin subspace . by using the states of @xmath69 to form basis states for @xmath73 which are also eigenstates of @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87",
    ", it can be shown that the @xmath73 can be diagonalized _ independently _ within each subspace , thereby reducing the computation time significantly .",
    "furthermore , as the states within each spin multiplet are degenerate , one can use the wigner - eckart theorem @xcite to avoid having to consider each of them explicitly .",
    "it is then unnecessary to retain the @xmath80 labels , which we thus omit from here onward .",
    "it is of course impossible to perform the iterative diagonalization exactly  the dimensionality of the hilbert space grows by a factor of 16 at each step . even exploiting the symmetries just described",
    ", the complete numerical diagonalization of @xmath69 becomes unfeasible after just a few iterations .",
    "the solution @xcite is to retain only a certain number @xmath88 of the lowest energy states of @xmath69 to calculate the states of @xmath73 , with @xmath88 chosen as a compromise between reducing the computation time while keeping the resulting truncation errors to a minimum .",
    "the results in this paper have typically been obtained using @xmath89 ( which we add excludes spin multiplicities ) .",
    "in addition , one must also take into account the error resulting from the logarithmic discretization of the hamiltonian .",
    "the discretized hamiltonian ( [ eq : hdiscdef ] ) is an exact transformation of ( [ eq : hcont ] ) in the limit @xmath90 .",
    "while one might naively imagine that @xmath91 should be chosen as close to @xmath92 as possible , this is not so @xcite because the number of iterations needed to reach the low - energy conduction band states that dominate low - energy properties would become very large ; not only increasing the calculation time , but more importantly allowing the cumulative effect of the truncation error from each iteration to become unacceptably large .",
    "it is in fact possible to make corrections for the discretization error resulting from even a relatively large @xmath91 @xcite ; and for the present calculations we take @xmath93 .",
    "the temperature dependence of relevant thermodynamic functions can be calculated via the nrg as described in @xcite . in this paper , we give results for three ` impurity ' susceptibilities ( borrowing the established terminology associated with anderson - type impurity models ) .",
    "these are the spin , uniform charge and staggered charge susceptibilities , denoted by @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 respectively , and defined as @xmath97 ^ 2\\right\\rangle_\\mathrm{imp}\\\\ \\label{eq : chicpmdef } k_\\mathrm{b}t\\chi_c^\\pm=\\case{1}{4}\\left\\langle[\\hat n_l\\pm\\hat",
    "n_r-\\langle\\hat n_l\\pm\\hat n_r\\rangle]^2\\right\\rangle_\\mathrm{imp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 is the @xmath81-component of the total spin , and @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) is the total charge operator for the left ( right ) lead and dot subsystem ( as usual , @xmath101 with @xmath102 denoting a thermal average in the absence of the impurities / dots ) .",
    "note that the staggered charge susceptibility @xmath96 is effectively a ` charge pseudospin ' analogue of the spin susceptibility @xmath103 , and that at the point @xmath6 where the model has @xmath5 symmetry ( see ( [ eq : hsufour ] ) ) , @xmath104 ( as discussed further in  5,6 ) .",
    "in addition , we shall use the impurity free energy @xmath105 ( with @xmath106 the partition function in the absence of the two dots ) to calculate the impurity entropy @xmath107 , and the linear specific heat coefficient @xmath108 given by @xmath109 . from here",
    "on , we will take @xmath110 for convenience .",
    "before discussing the full numerical results , we examine the fixed points that control the nrg flows . in particular we shall see that there are two distinct classes of _ stable _ fixed points , the mere existence of which implies a quantum phase transition in the model above a critical interdot interaction @xmath111 .",
    "two initial remarks on the general nature of nrg fixed points should be made .",
    "first , the energies of the hamiltonian @xmath69 ( [ eq : hndef ] ) are well known @xcite to depend fundamentally on whether @xmath68 is even or odd .",
    "one works therefore with fixed points of @xmath112 , the fixed point hamiltonian @xmath113 satisfying @xmath114 .",
    "the second , more subtle point is that each successive rg transformation increases the dimensionality of the hilbert space of the problem ; no hamiltonian can thus remain entirely unaffected by @xmath112 .",
    "but there do exist hamiltonians , @xmath115 , for which the _ low - lying _ states ( i.e.  the @xmath116th lowest excitations , with @xmath117 ) remain asymptotically unaffected by the rg transformation ; it is these which constitute the fixed points of the nrg procedure .",
    "the set of nrg fixed points consistent with the symmetries of the dqd hamiltonian ( [ eq : hdiscdef ] ) may be deduced by setting each of its bare parameters to a value of either zero or infinity .",
    "this leaves in all cases a pair of ` free ' conduction chains , plus a piece that describes any remaining dot degrees - of - freedom .",
    "since the free conduction chain energy levels themselves converge rapidly @xcite with increasing @xmath68 , while the isolated dot degrees - of - freedom are entirely unaffected by the nrg transformation , this decoupled hamiltonian is necessarily a fixed point of @xmath112 .",
    "lists the five distinct fixed points resulting from the procedure sketched above .",
    "@lllll name&abbreviation&@xmath118&@xmath1&@xmath0 + free orbital&fo&0&0&0 + @xmath33 local moment&lm@xmath119&0&@xmath120&0 + @xmath5 local moment&lm@xmath121&0&@xmath120&@xmath120 + charge",

    "the other two fixed points , lm@xmath121 and co , have no analogues in the aim , and thus generate the distinct physics of the dqd model .",
    "the stability of each fixed point in can be investigated by linearising the nrg transformation in its vicinity .",
    "any perturbation @xmath122 of the fixed point that is consistent with its underlying symmetries , is known @xcite to have the following expansion in terms of the eigenvectors @xmath123 , and corresponding eigenvalues @xmath124 , of the matrix @xmath125 that describes the transformation : @xmath126 ( with @xmath127 a constant independent of @xmath68 ) . by analysing the possible @xmath122s in ( [ eq : fpexpand ] )",
    ", one can deduce the eigenvalues @xmath124 by equating the @xmath68-dependences of both sides . if any of these @xmath122s generate relevant eigenvectors , the fixed point is unstable .",
    "for each fixed point of the dqd system , shows the resultant perturbations that generate the most relevant eigenvectors of the linearised nrg transformation .",
    "most are straightforward to analyse in practice . the free orbital fixed point is readily shown to be unstable , and the strong coupling fixed point to be stable .",
    "each of the local moment fixed points is marginal to leading ( linear ) order , but our numerical results in show they are both unstable under the full nrg transformation .",
    "the charge ordered ( co ) fixed point by contrast is more subtle ; we thus devote the next section to consideration of its behaviour .    @lllll",

    "this decouples the dots from the leads , leaving a pair of free conduction bands plus the two degenerate dot charge configurations @xmath153 and @xmath19 . to avoid excessive use of projection operators in the following ,",
    "it is implicit that the hilbert space in which the co fixed point hamiltonian acts contains these dot configurations only .",
    "as seen in , two corrections to the fixed point govern its stability .",
    "we begin by discussing the marginal term @xmath154 which describes potential scattering of the conduction electrons .",
    "the key point here is that although the magnitude of this potential scattering is equal for both the @xmath155 and @xmath156 conduction bands , the signs are opposite and _ correlated _ with the two charge configurations of the dots .",
    "it is this correlation that is responsible for much of the interesting behaviour of the dqd model .",
    "as shown originally in @xcite , the effect of potential scattering on the conduction band chains can be conveniently incorporated into the definition of the fixed point itself . following the notation of @xcite",
    "we introduce a coupling constant @xmath157 to specify its magnitude  such that the appropriate picture is of a _ line _ of co fixed points with different values of @xmath158and thus obtain the following co fixed point hamiltonian : @xmath159.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the appendix , we point out that a continuum version of this hamiltonian is precisely the ` full ' low - energy model for the dqd system when @xmath160 ; and by comparison of the discrete and continuum forms obtain a relationship between @xmath158 and the bare parameters of the model , which we show to be in excellent agreement with @xmath158 obtained from the full nrg calculations at large @xmath0 .",
    "as far as the present discussion is concerned , the most important result to be drawn from the continuum version of ( [ eq : hncok ] ) is that the potential scattering generates equal and opposite phase shifts in the two leads , the magnitude of which can be related to @xmath158 via @xmath161,\\ ] ] which result will shortly prove useful .",
    "given that @xmath146 above is exactly marginal , the stability of each co fixed point is found to be controlled by the term @xmath149 in , namely @xmath162 with @xmath163 this operator describes four - electron cotunnelling processes that interconvert the @xmath18 and @xmath19 dot configurations , and thereby switch the signs of the potential scattering on each lead .",
    "the relevance of @xmath149 is not obvious from simple power counting @xcite ; the action of on the eigenstates of @xmath164 is very similar to the non - perturbative x - ray edge problem @xcite and hence requires a somewhat more sophisticated treatment such as bosonization @xcite . by considering the long - time behaviour of the correlation function @xmath165",
    ", one can show that the eigenvalue associated with @xmath149 goes as @xmath151 , where @xmath166 is an anomalous exponent that is related to the conduction band phase shift @xmath167 via @xmath168 this anomalous exponent arises also for a particular limit of the ising - coupled kondo impurity model @xcite , a point which to which we return in .",
    "the stability of each co fixed point depends on the corresponding sign of @xmath166 , which can be calculated directly from and . since @xmath169 it is easy to see that the line of co fixed points divides at a critical @xmath170 into two classes : stable for @xmath171 ( i.e. @xmath148 ) , and unstable for @xmath172 ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "the critical point , at which @xmath166 vanishes , thus corresponds to a phase shift @xmath174 given by @xmath175 and hence a critical potential scattering strength @xmath176\\ ] ] ( as we also confirm numerically in the appendix ) .",
    "note that in the particle - hole symmetric limit considered explicitly , @xmath174 is entirely independent of the bare material parameters .",
    "that is not however true in general  deviation from particle - hole symmetry generates additional potential scattering of the _ same _ sign on the two leads .",
    "this breaks the simple ` equal and opposite ' relationship between the @xmath155 and @xmath156 phase shifts , and leads to a more complicated form for the anomalous exponent @xmath166 ( but as mentioned above does not alter the essential physics , which is wholly robust to departure from _ p - h _ symmetry ) .",
    "our analysis of the nrg fixed points shows two qualitatively distinct classes of stable fixed points , sc and co. this of course implies the existence of a quantum phase transition in the system .",
    "points in phase space that flow to the sc fixed point under renormalization comprise the ` strong coupling ' phase , where all the degrees of freedom associated with the dots are frozen - out at low temperatures , while the set of points which flow to the co fixed point define a ` charge ordered ' phase which has a doubly - degenerate ground state .",
    "although the phase transition can of course be approached in any direction , we will tend to envisage crossing from sc to co by increasing @xmath0 at a fixed @xmath1 and @xmath118 ; the transition then takes place at the critical point @xmath177 .",
    "it is helpful at this stage to draw a schematic flow diagram showing how the various fixed points of the model are approached under different choices of the bare parameters @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath118 ; this will be useful in the next section when we analyse how the various unstable fixed points affect the sc phase , and how the co fixed point in particular controls the quantum phase transition .",
    "[ the structure of the flow diagram is of course deduced from the full nrg calculations , as detailed in section 6 . ] in the flow diagram is drawn in the three - dimensional ( @xmath178 ) effective parameter space ( we omit the potential scattering generated in the region of the co fixed points , and thus represent schematically the line of co fixed points by a single point ) . in this work",
    "we are primarily concerned with the strongly - correlated regime arising for @xmath179 , and hence take the bandwidth @xmath180 to be the largest energy scale ; all flows thus begin near the fo fixed point , as shown in the figure .    when the bare @xmath3 , the flow is first to the lm@xmath119 fixed point , and then to the stable sc @xcite .",
    "switching on a finite @xmath0 brings the additional fixed points of the dqd system into play , as shown by the successively darker flow lines in .",
    "when @xmath6 ( i.e.  the ` middle ' flow line in ) , the nrg flow remains in the @xmath181 plane throughout , heading to the lm@xmath121 fixed point before ultimately the stable sc . with any deviation from this @xmath5 symmetry ,",
    "the flows are drawn away from the the @xmath181 plane , crossing over instead to lm@xmath119 ( for @xmath48 ) or co ( for @xmath49 ) .",
    "the physics around the co fixed point is in fact crucial to the problem : we show in that there is a range of @xmath0 above @xmath1 where the co fixed point is unstable , the flows ultimately turning to sc at large @xmath68 as depicted by the fourth flow in . at a critical @xmath182",
    "however , the co fixed point becomes stable and the quantum phase transition from the sc phase to the co phase ensues .",

    "second , the limiting values of @xmath364 as @xmath187 in the co phase are clearly @xmath0-dependent ; this arises naturally from the potential scattering generated at the co fixed point ( and considered further in the appendix ) . in the absence of such potential scattering  as arises in the limit @xmath374  the @xmath187 limit of @xmath364 is unity .",
    "the three wilson ratios characteristic of the sc phase ( @xmath223 and @xmath224 ) have been considered in , and exact results for them obtained at the points @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath375 . here",
    "we show the corresponding numerical results as a function of @xmath261 ; this shows the @xmath261 scales over which the ratios change from one value to the next , and also provides an indication of the accuracy of the nrg calculations .",
    "( right ) shows the @xmath286-dependence of @xmath223 and @xmath363 for @xmath256 ; as @xmath263 here is large , the uniform charge susceptibility and hence @xmath236 is found in practice to be essentially zero over the entire @xmath0 range .",
    "we see that the @xmath231 , @xmath376 result known for the @xmath3 limit @xcite persists with increasing @xmath261 until _ very _ close to the @xmath5 point ; but then the two wilson ratios undergo a rapid crossover to the values @xmath377 and @xmath378 ( ( [ eq : doodah ] ) ) , which values obtain in practice over a large part of the charge - kondo regime . at the @xmath5 point itself , we recover numerically ( to within @xmath379 ) the exact result @xmath380 ( ( [ eq : doodahday ] ) ) expected from the symmetry of the model .",
    "finally , we consider the important issue of the scaling properties of thermodynamics in the sc phase ( naturally in strong coupling , @xmath229 , where the kondo scale @xmath222 is exponentially small and well separated from all non - universal scales ) .",
    "we point out immediately that it is not possible to define a single universal scaling function ( for each thermodynamic property ) that applies throughout the sc phase .",
    "the reason is simple : although the spin - kondo regime ( @xmath381 ) , @xmath5 point ( @xmath347 ) and charge - kondo regime ( @xmath382 ) all belong to the sc phase , the crossover from one to the next being continuous with increasing @xmath0 , each has its own characteristic low - temperature behaviour because the particular degrees - of - freedom quenched by the kondo effect are different in each case .",
    "this is particularly apparent from the wilson ratios shown in .",
    "we thus focus on the three distinct regimes separately , beginning with spin - kondo .    in the spin - kondo regime , it is the crossover of the spin - susceptibility @xmath334 on the scale of @xmath222 that characterises the physics of the spin - kondo effect . in , we show @xmath334 versus @xmath305 for @xmath283 ( solid line ) , @xmath383 ( dotted line ) and @xmath335 ( dashed line ) , all with @xmath256 .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the rescaled susceptibilities all collapse onto a common curve at low temperatures ( and that the crossover from lm@xmath119 to sc indeed occurs at @xmath328 ) .",
    "also plotted in ( as a set of points ) are double the universal _",
    "single_-impurity kondo susceptibilities taken from table v of @xcite , which are clearly in excellent agreement with the scaling curves obtained here .",
    "[ the kondo scale of @xcite , here denoted by @xmath384 , is easily shown to be related to our definition @xmath269 by @xmath385 , with @xmath386 the wilson number @xcite ] .",
    "universal scaling of the spin - susceptibility in the spin - kondo regime : @xmath334 versus @xmath305 for @xmath256 and @xmath283 ( solid line ) , @xmath383 ( dotted line ) and @xmath335 ( dashed line ) . the points plotted in the figure are double the universal single - impurity kondo susceptibilities , taken from table v of @xcite . ]    in the charge - kondo regime , it is by contrast the staggered charge - susceptibility that shows universality . in we",

    "points in the spin - kondo regime ( @xmath391 ) do not scale onto this universal curve , because there the charge susceptibility vanishes on a finite energy scale @xmath392 ( such that @xmath393 is thus ` projected out ' in the formal scaling limit @xmath394 ) .",

    "the spin and staggered charge susceptibilities coincide , @xmath397 . ]",
    "using the numerical renormalization group we have considered a symmetrical , capacitively coupled dqd in the two - electron regime , and investigated the evolution of the system as a function of both the interdot and intradot coupling strengths .",
    "the range of physical behaviour found is both broad and subtle , encompassing a strong coupling , fermi liquid phase  itself divided into spin - kondo and charge - kondo regimes separated by a spin - charge entangled @xmath5 line  as well as a broken symmetry charge ordered phase , and the kosterlitz - thouless quantum phase transition occurring between the two . as far as specific physical properties are concerned",
    ", we have focussed largely in this paper on static properties , such as ` impurity ' thermodynamics , spin- and charge - susceptibilities etc .",
    "importantly , the nrg approach also enables us to determine dynamical properties such as local single - particle spectra  @xcite and related transport properties .",
    "it is to these we shall turn in a subsequent paper  @xcite . + * acknowledgements",
    "*    we are grateful to the epsrc for supporting this research , and to the royal society for travel support .",
    "in the strongly correlated regime , one can of course obtain a low - energy effective model for the @xmath13 regime by performing a schrieffer - wolff transformation @xcite of ( [ eq : hnought],_b _ ) to order @xmath398 .",
    "the final result is @xmath399 where @xmath400 and the coupling constants are @xmath401 the first term on the right - hand side of acts solely on states of the @xmath402 dot configuration . it is simply a separable pair of spin-@xmath403 kondo couplings between each dot and its respective lead .",
    "by contrast , the second term in acts only on states of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 configurations ; this is the correlated potential scattering term that arises at the co fixed point ( see ) .",
    "it is the third term in that mixes the different charge sectors , but note that although @xmath264 connects to both @xmath18 and @xmath19 to order @xmath398 , the @xmath18 and @xmath19 states do _ not _ connect directly to each other .",
    "for the special case of @xmath6 , one obtains @xmath404 and the hamiltonian then takes the manifestly @xmath5 symmetric form @xmath405 with @xmath32 as before .",
    "the effective hamiltonian above leads to a simple physical picture of the dqd physics with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath3 , only the first term in need be retained : the @xmath18/@xmath19 states lie an energy @xmath1 above the @xmath264 ground state by virtue of the @xmath406 term in , and hence do not contribute to leading order in @xmath407 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is thus two uncoupled spin-@xmath403 kondo models as one would of course expect .",
    "this situation does not change with increasing @xmath0 until the energy gained by mixing @xmath18/@xmath19 into the @xmath264 ground state  of order the @xmath5 kondo temperature @xmath323  is sufficient to outweigh the cost of promoting electrons into these excited states , @xmath406 .",
    "hence one would expect a rapid crossover from the @xmath357 kondo effect characteristic of @xmath283 , to the @xmath5 kondo behaviour of @xmath6 , at a @xmath408 as indeed seen in .",
    "once @xmath49 , the order of the @xmath18/@xmath19 and @xmath264 states is reversed with the latter being the excited state through which the former interconvert ( via the third term in ) .",
    "if @xmath406 is sufficiently small , then the interconversion of @xmath18 and @xmath19 via @xmath264 gives rise to a charge - kondo effect that quenches the @xmath265 charge pseudospin , and thus the sc phase persists above @xmath0 ( as shown in and the associated discussion ) .",
    "once @xmath409 however , the stabilisation energy associated with this charge - kondo effect can not compensate for the additional cost of occupying the @xmath264 excited states , the @xmath18 and @xmath19 states do not therefore communicate , and the system undergoes the quantum phase transition to the co phase .",
    "deep in the co phase , when @xmath160 , one can simplify the effective hamiltonian further still by neglecting the terms in that involve the @xmath264 states .",
    "this leaves only the correlated potential scattering described by the second term .",
    "the resulting effective hamiltonian in the @xmath18/@xmath19 manifold is then a continuum form of the co fixed point hamiltonian , as mentioned in .",
    "this means that one can obtain the fixed point hamiltonian by direct discretisation of the effective hamiltonian ; from which the following relationship between @xmath410 and @xmath158 is obtained @xmath411 with @xmath412 the standard correction factor for the discretisation of the conduction band @xcite . in terms of the parameters of the full dqd hamiltonian ( [ eq : hnought],_b _ ) ,",
    "this becomes ( using ) @xmath413 which we plot in ( dashed line ) as a function of @xmath286 for fixed @xmath256 in the co phase .",
    "the solid line shows the value of @xmath158 obtained from our full numerics , and is indeed seen to fall rapidly onto as one moves deeper into the co phase .",
