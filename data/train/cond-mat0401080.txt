    "there are many intrinsically nonequilibrium phenomena which can be observed already in simplest systems of driven diffusing particles , a recent review of which can be found e.g. in @xcite .",
    "phase transitions induced by spatial boundaries of a system is one of those phenomena which was studied in detail for models with one - species of particles @xcite and for some multi - species models @xcite .",
    "the ability of a nonequlibrium system to feel  the boundaries constitutes a key feature of driven systems : in fact , the boundaries dominate the bulk giving rise to the phase transitions . it is a flux which brings information from the boundaries to the bulk : in absence of a flux , the boundary conditions play only a marginal role as one knows from equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "a boundary problem in a one - dimensional driven diffusive system can be formulated as follows : the system is coupled at the ends to reservoirs of particles with fixed particle densities .",
    "a dynamics in the bulk and at the boundaries is defined via hopping rates , which are time - independent . in this case , after a certain transition period , the system will approach a stationary state , characteristics of which ( the average flux , the density profile , the correlations ) do not depend on time .",
    "it is of of interest how the system relax to the stationary state . since a stationary state is independent on an initial state",
    ", one can choose an initial condition to be a domain wall interpolating between the boundaries .",
    "it has long been recognized that boundary - driven phase transitions are caused by the motion of a shock @xcite , so that the above initial choice is a very natural one .",
    "a key issue is to understand how the domain wall interacts with the boundaries . for the reference model in the field , an asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) with open boundaries",
    ", a stationary density is reached after just one reflection , or interaction with a boundary .",
    "we studied the reflection for the model with two conservation laws introduced in @xcite , and suprisingly observed infinitely many reflections occuring before a stationary state can be reached .",
    "more precisely , a domain wall after the first right reflection ( i.e. , the interaction with the right boundary ) attains a different value of the density which is then changed after the first left reflection , etc .. this process continues iteratively . the bulk densities after multiple reflections asymptotically approach the stationary values .    description of iterative reflection maps constitutes the main subject of the present paper .",
    "although the observed phenomenon of infinite reflections should be general , we use for the study a class of driven diffusive models having a simple stationary state on a ring for the sake of notational simplicity and to eliminate possible source of errors which may result from approximating a bulk flux , boundary conditions etc .. the findings are supported with monte carlo calculations and hydrodynamic limit analysis .    the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ model ] we define the model and its symmetries and describe the stationary state on a ring .",
    "hydrodynamic limit equations are given in section  [ pde ] . in section  [ reflection ]",
    "reflection maps are introduced and infinite iterative sequences are analyzed .",
    "details concerning boundary rates can be found in the appendix .",
    "the model that we shall take as the example for our study is a particular case of a more general model introduced in @xcite , which can be viewed as a two - line generalization of asep .",
    "there are two parallel chains , chain @xmath0 and chain @xmath1 consisting of @xmath2 sites each",
    ". any site can be empty or be occupied by a particle .",
    "the particle at a site @xmath3 can hop to its nearest right - hand site @xmath4 on the same chain provided it is vacant .",
    "the rate of hopping depends on the occupancy of the adjacent sites on the other chain , see fig .",
    "[ fig_4rates ] . hopping between the chains",
    "is forbidden .",
    "the hopping rates are fully symmetric with respect to an exchange between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "correspondingly , there are 4 different rates @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_4rates ] ) .",
    "however if one chooses them to satisfy @xmath6 , then all particle configurations occur with the same probability in a stationary state ( see @xcite ) . in this case",
    ", the rate @xmath7 can be used to parametrize all the rates , @xmath8 stationary fluxes on a ring with the densities @xmath9 and @xmath10 of the particles on the @xmath0 and @xmath1 -chain respectively are given in the thermodynamic limit ( see @xcite ) by @xmath11{cc}j^{a}(\\rho^{a},\\rho^{b } ) & = \\rho^{a}(1-\\rho^{a})(1+(\\beta-1)\\rho^{b})\\\\ j^{b}(\\rho^{a},\\rho^{b } ) & = \\rho^{b}(1-\\rho^{b})(1+(\\beta-1)\\rho^{a } ) \\end{array } \\label{fluxes}\\ ] ] for @xmath12 all the rates ( [ rates ] ) become equal , which corresponds to an absence of an interaction between the chains , and the system splits into asymmetric exclusion processes @xcite .",
    "another choice of the rates @xmath13 was considered in @xcite .",
    "the rates are by the definition nonnegative , so @xmath7 is in the range @xmath14 .",
    "however it is sufficient to consider @xmath15 because of a particle - hole symmetry .",
    "indeed , an exchange of particles and holes plus the substitution @xmath16 leaves the model invariant .    in our context , we shall deal with a finite chains , where particles can be injected at the left end and be extracted at the right end of the system .",
    "we choose the boundary rates corresponding to effective stationary reservoirs of particles with fixed particle densities .",
    "explicit expressions for the boundary rates are given , see the appendix , in terms of the boundary densities .",
    "we denote the densities of @xmath17-particles in the left boundary reservoir as @xmath18 , and @xmath19 for the right boundary reservoir .",
    "a naive continuum ( eulerian ) limit of our stochastic dynamics on a lattice @xmath20 , @xmath21 is a system of conservation laws @xmath22 @xmath23 where on the right - hand side of ( [ cons2 ] ) a phenomenological vanishing viscosity term has been added .",
    "this simplest regularization term leads to the correct answer for the riemann problem , as compared to the stochastic model , see @xcite , but fails to describe a reflection from the boundaries ( see table  [ table_derivative ] ) .",
    "an adequate viscosity term is obtained by averaging of exact lattice continuity equations of the stochastic process @xmath24 for occupation number operators @xmath25 , and taking the continuous limit @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "for the case ( [ rates ] ) , the flux operator @xmath28 reads ( see @xcite ) @xmath29 and @xmath30 is obtained by an exchange @xmath31 in the above .",
    "we substitute ( [ flux_operator ] ) into ( [ oper1]),([oper2 ] ) , average , factorize and taylor expand the latter with respect to a lattice spacing @xmath32 . in the first order of expansion , one obtains @xmath33 a numerical integration of ( [ hydroa]),([hydrob ] ) shows that the dynamics of the stochastic process is described adequately . at the same time",
    ", predictions of ( [ cons2 ] ) strongly disagree with the stochastic dynamics ( see e.g. table  [ table_derivative ] ) .",
    "thus , in contradiction to the one - species case , where a choice of the vanishing viscosity is very robust , for a model with two and more species the specific choice of the viscosity becomes crucial : different choices give different answers .",
    "we explain our approach firstly for noninteracting chains @xmath12 . in this case",
    "the dynamics of each chain reduces to the one of the asep with an injection rate @xmath34 and an extraction rate @xmath35 , see @xcite , corresponding to reservoirs of particles with densities @xmath34 and @xmath36 on the left and on the right boundary , see the appendix . to study interaction with the right boundary , choose an initial state to be a homogeneous state @xmath37 , for all @xmath3 , matching perfectly the left boundary .",
    "consequently the particle distribution at the left boundary will not change in time , while at the right boundary there is a mismatch if @xmath38 , which has to be resolved .",
    "monte - carlo simulation shows that one of the following scenarios is realized , see fig .",
    "[ fig_scenariosasep ] : ( a ) a thin boundary layer develops interpolating between the bulk density @xmath39 and @xmath36 , and stays always attached to the right boundary , ( b ) a shock wave of the density @xmath36 develops and propagates to the left boundary , ( c ) a rarefaction wave with the density @xmath40 forms and spreads towards the left boundary .",
    "analogously , we study the left reflection , choosing an initial condition @xmath41",
    ". then , the mismatch will be only at the left boundary .",
    "we can predict interaction results by exploiting a particle - hole symmetry of the model : an exchange of particles and holes and the left with the right boundary leaves the system invariant . hence",
    "a dynamics of the model with @xmath42 is equivalent to a dynamics of the dual model @xmath43 the corresponding local densities of the dual model satisfy @xmath44 as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig_scenariosasep]d shows the monte carlo evolution corresponding to shock propagation , dual to the one on fig .",

    "we shall classify an outcome of a reflection from a boundary by an average particle density @xmath45 of the reflected wave measured at some point @xmath46 not too close to the boundary to avoid boundary effects .",
    "the density @xmath45 is measured after the reflection wave has passed the point @xmath46 but before it has reached the other boundary , to avoid possible interference .",
    "for instance , reflected wave has the density @xmath47 for the scenario ( a ) , @xmath48 for the scenario ( b ) and @xmath49 for the scenario ( c ) on fig .",
    "[ fig_scenariosasep ] .",
    "we can summarize the results of all possible reflections from the right boundary @xmath36 by plotting the density of the reflected wave versus the initial bulk density , see fig .",

    ", one can make an important observation .",
    "namely , _ the stationary state density is achieved after one reflection _ from any of the boundaries .",
    "we have checked this statement to be true also for a two - parameter model with a next nearest neighbour interaction ( kls model ) , the stationary phase diagram of which is obtained in @xcite .    in the following",
    "we show that for a two - component system it takes _ infinite number of reflections _ until the stationary density is reached .",
    "consider the two - chain model ( [ rates ] ) coupled to boundary reservoirs with the densities of @xmath0- and @xmath1- particles @xmath50 and @xmath51 at the left and at the right end respectively .",
    "consider a reflection problem by choosing an initially homogeneous particle distribution with the densities @xmath52 @xmath53 we shall classify results of a reflection as it was done above for asep . denote the densities of the particles in the reflected wave in @xmath54 and @xmath1-chain as @xmath55 .",
    "suppose that after interaction with a boundary an interface appears between @xmath56 and @xmath55 moving towards the other boundary . due to particle number conservation in the bulk , a @xmath57-component of the interface moves with the velocity @xcite @xmath58 where we used the short notations @xmath59 , @xmath60 . since there is an interaction between the chains , the velocities must coincide in both chains because a perturbation in one chain causes the response in the other and vice versa .",
