    "@xmath10 functions , studied by sarason in @xcite , do appear first in @xcite , in order to obtain @xmath9 estimates for the solutions of uniformly elliptic equations in non divergence form , and later in @xcite , in non divergence form . in both two cases techniques",
    "rely on suitable representation formulas , on singular integrals depending on a parameter , and on their commutators with @xmath40 fuctions .",
    "@xmath10 condition is a type of discontinuity which implies some kind of average continuity : in such a sense , @xmath10 hypothesis extends classical theory of agmon  douglis  nirenberg in @xcite .",
    "indeed uniformly continuous bounded functions , as well the ones in @xmath41 and @xmath420,1[,$ ] belong to @xmath43 the introduction of such a family of vector fields goes back to the paper of hrmander @xcite where the author shows that hypoellipticity of the solution of a differential equation related to a sum of squares of vector fields follows from a geometric condition on the vector fields and their commutators . later , rothschild e stein in @xcite , deal with the problem of a natural setting in which such a sum of square operators can be cast .",
    "the algebraic structures that do appear in this new setting are nowadays known as carnt groups ; in particular , euclidean spaces are a very particular cases .",
    "these are particular simply connected nilpotents lie groups whose finite dimensional lie algebra admits a graduated stratification in vector subspaces .",
    "it follows that this algebraic structure is naturally equipped with a family of automorphisms which generalize the standard product with scalars in @xmath44 finally , a well known theorem of rothschild e stein shows how it is possible to approximate a class of differential operators consisting of a system of hrmander vector fields , through invariant differential operators defined in suitable carnt groups . from the metric viewpoint",
    ", we can naturally settle these spaces in a general class of metric spaces nowadays known as _",
    "carnt  caratheodory metric spaces _ , where metric is introduced through suitable finite families of lipschitz vector fields .",
    "such metric spaces has been intensively studied in the last thirty years in several setting of pure and applied mathematics such as degenerate elliptic differential equations , hypoelliptic differential operators , sub ",
    "riemannian manifolds , control theory , mathematical models of human vision , robotics , geometric measure theory . in particular ,",
    "when the vector fields inducing the metric satisfy hrmander condition , the associate metric @xmath45 enjoys many good properties : for instance , the induced topology is actually the euclidean one ; all necessary properties for our purpose can be found in @xcite . it should be clear that , in this paper , such a metric will play a role becouse the coefficients @xmath46 of the operator belong to the space @xmath47 defined through the carnot ",
    "caratheodory metric induced by the vector fields associated to the hypoelliptic variational operator .",
    "coming back to hypoelliptic operators consisting of a family of hrmander vector fields , @xmath47 functions do appear in the papers of bramanti and brandolini @xcite .",
    "indeed , the coefficients @xmath46 are assumed to belong to the @xmath47 space with respect to the metric induced from the vector fields : clearly in general the space @xmath47 is different from the euclidean@xmath48 so particular metric proofs must be adapted in this new setting .",
    "moreover , the proofs of the results in the euclidean setting ( see @xcite ) need several notions : the existence of a translation invariant fundamental solutions smooth away from the origin , convolution operators , representation formulas , parametrized singular integrals and riesz potential , commutators with @xmath40 functions , analysis on spaces of homogeneous type , properties of @xmath10 functions . in the new setting , and in particular in our case , these notions and proofs can be adapted by employing the technics introduced by rothschild e stein , see @xcite ) so that , all in all , the properties of the solution of the given equation can be recovered from the properties of the solution of a new equation associated to a new operator defined locally on a suitable carnot group , pulling back local estimates in this last setting to a local estimate for the solution of the given operator . in particular , arguing as in @xcite , the use of a parametrix implies that coefficients @xmath46 be smooth , that is every function in @xmath47 should be approximated by a sequence of smooth functions : this is actually possible : in @xcite , in the setting of a general space of homogeneous type , the space @xmath10 is defined both through balls and cubes , and the density property with smooth functions with respect to the @xmath40 norm is proved , in the particular case of a carnt ",
