    "entanglement is a central concept in quantum theory and an important resource in quantum information theory .",
    "different entanglement measures have been introduced to understand the structure of entanglement between finite - dimensional systems .",
    "one such measure is entanglement entropy , which can also be defined for pure states of extended quantum systems .",
    "since all measurements on extended systems are performed within some finite region of space , it is natural in the relativistic context to study entanglement between localized subsystems , i.e. subsystems associated with spacelike separated regions of spacetime . although natural , this is also problematic , because relativistic field theories typically have infinite entanglement entropy between a region of space and its complement at fixed time @xcite .",
    "indeed , the separation of the degrees of freedom of a quantum field into a finite region of space @xmath0 and its complement @xmath1 implies a specific mapping associating @xmath0 and @xmath1 with commuting subalgebras of the algebra of observables , called a localization scheme @xcite .",
    "different localization schemes correspond to different tensor product structures ( tps ) of the total hilbert space .",
    "since entanglement is a property defined between subsystems , different localization schemes yield different values for entanglement between @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite . a standard localization scheme associates to space regions the field operators and their conjugates therein defined .",
    "the vacuum state is entangled with respect to the tps induced by the standard localization scheme , hence any two localized subsystems are correlated by modes at their boundary .",
    "consequently , the entropy of entanglement between @xmath0 and @xmath1 diverges due to the contribution of ultraviolet ( uv ) modes .",
    "this peculiar behavior of entanglement is deeply rooted in the algebraic structure of relativistic quantum field theory ( qft ) .",
    "indeed , it is a direct consequence of the reeh - schlieder theorem @xcite that all finite - energy states maximally violate bell - like inequalities @xcite .",
    "an operational content is given to this violation in @xcite : whenever the local algebras of observables of a bipartite system are not type i von neumann algebras , maximally entangled states have infinite one - copy entanglement . for systems with type",
    "i local algebras of observables , states with infinite entropy of entanglement are trace - norm dense in state space @xcite .",
    "it follows from these arguments that entanglement measures for bipartite states with localized subsystems typically diverge at all energy scales when these are analyzed at a more fundamental level using qft .",
    "such subsystems do not yet correspond to the ones defined in the nonrelativistic regime , _",
    "e.g. _ qubits or trapped ions in quantum information protocols .",
    "the latter are described by finite dimensional hilbert spaces and they generally produce finite results for entanglement measures .",
    "one expects that in the low - energy limit the degrees of freedom describing a region of space should simply correspond to the degrees of freedom of the particles therein contained .",
    "however , as a consequence of the reeh - schlieder theorem one can not define local number operators , therefore finite - energy states can not be localized @xcite , making such a correspondence impossible .",
    "hence a conceptual tension between the qft description of entanglement for low - energy experiments and a description using nonrelativistic quantum theory .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a novel approach to reconcile these two disagreeing notions of entanglement .",
    "consider a scenario in which all possible field measurements are limited by some minimal spatial resolution @xmath2 , thus restricting the algebra of observables to coarse - grained fields .",
    "the coarse - graining parameter @xmath2 has a clear operational meaning : since in practical situations it is impossible to resolve points in space with arbitrary precision , any realistic measurement of a field necessarily consists of a sample of a finite number of points , where each point corresponds to a finite region of space .",
    "we show that in the limit @xmath3 , @xmath4 being the mass of a klein - gordon field , states with a finite number of particles become localized , allowing an identification between a region of space and the nonrelativistic degrees of freedom of the particles therein contained , and that the renormalized entropy of finite - energy states reduces to the one calculated in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "this provides the missing controlled transition from the qft picture of entanglement to entanglement in nonrelativistic quantum theory .",
    "consider at fixed time a finite region of space @xmath0 and its complement @xmath1 .",
    "region @xmath0 has two complementary descriptions : classical general relativity identifies it with a submanifold of minkowski spacetime , but as a quantum subsystem , @xmath0 is described by a hilbert space @xmath5 , which is a factor in the tensor product decomposition @xmath6 of the total hilbert space of the field theory under investigation .",
    "suppose that the field is in a state @xmath7 .",
    "the results of measurements to be performed in region @xmath0 are described by the reduced density matrix obtained by tracing out the degrees of freedom outside @xmath0 : @xmath8 .",
    "the von neumann entropy associated with region @xmath0 is then defined as @xmath9 .",
    "this quantity typically requires some uv regulator in order to be well defined .",
    "thus , in @xcite , a uv cutoff @xmath10 is introduced at the boundary between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and in @xcite a qft is defined on a lattice of spacing @xmath10 .",
    "references @xcite show that for the vacuum state , the entropy of entanglement associated with region @xmath0 can be written as : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the area of the boundary between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath4 the mass of the field , @xmath13 an infrared cutoff and @xmath14 some slowly varying function . for finite - energy states , power - law correction terms need to be added @xcite .",
    "these expressions diverge in the continuum limit for @xmath15 and , more generally , no cutoff - independent low - energy limit of the entropy can be derived using these approaches .",
    "a renormalization technique proposed in @xcite leads to states of negative entropy , which is not expected for a physically meaningful concept of state entropy .",
    "yet another approach consists in introducing a physical model of the measurement apparatus .",
    "one then derives an effective low - energy model of the measurement apparatus insensitive to vacuum entanglement of the underlying qft @xcite .",
    "however , this approach is strongly dependent on the choice of the model and does not provide a general and clear transition from the qft picture of entanglement to entanglement in nonrelativistic quantum theory .",
    "for simplicity , we consider a neutral klein - gordon field of mass @xmath4 in one space dimension at fixed time ( we put @xmath16 ) .",
    "the algebra of local observables for the klein - gordon field is generated by the canonical field operators : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 creates a field excitation of momentum @xmath20 .",
    "the vacuum is defined by : @xmath21    assume that the resolution for distinguishing different points in space is bounded by some minimal length @xmath2 .",
    "the algebra of observables that are accessible under such conditions is generated by the coarse - grained field operators ( see fig.[schema ] ) : @xmath22 function @xmath23 describes the detection profile : @xmath24this choice of profile is natural if we interpret coarse graining as arising from a random error in the identification of a point in space . more generally , for any profile with a typical length @xmath25 , consider intervals of length @xmath2 on which the profile is approximately constant .",
    "one can then convolute such a profile with a gaussian of variance @xmath2 and consider the limit @xmath26 instead of @xmath27 .    .",
    "this source of error is implemented by restricting the observable degrees of freedom to those accessible via measurement of coarse - grained operators .",
    "neighboring profiles define different subsystems only if their separation @xmath28 verifies @xmath29 . under this condition ,",
    "entanglement between neigboring profiles is a well - defined notion .",
    "we show that for finite - energy states , this entanglement reduces to the one calculated in nonrelativistic quantum theory . ]",
    "define the operators : @xmath30where @xmath28 is the distance between neighbouring profiles .",
    "if @xmath31 , they verify canonical commutation relations : @xmath32\\sim i\\delta_{j\\,k}.\\]]imposing is equivalent to saying that the operators @xmath33 generate commuting subalgebras .",
    "two commuting subalgebras of observables @xmath34 and @xmath35 that generate the whole algebra of observables induce a tps on the hilbert space of states : @xmath36 such that @xmath37 , @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the operators generate only a strict subalgebra of the entire algebra of field observables , because under coarse graining some possible observables are inaccessible .",
    "the whole algebra can be recovered by completing the set of functions @xmath39 up to an orthonormal basis in @xmath40 which , convoluted with the field operators , defines a linear canonical transformation of modes .",
    "thus , the algebra generated by the coarse - grained observables defines a decomposition of the total hilbert space @xmath41 , where @xmath42 are the coarse - grained , hence accessible , and @xmath43 the fine - grained inaccessible degrees of freedom .",
    "the restriction to coarse - grained observables is therefore equivalent to tracing out subsystem @xmath43 , and operators @xmath44 define distinct subsystems on @xmath45 , each of which is isomorphic to a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator .",
    "thus , we can define on @xmath45 the coarse - grained ladder operators : @xmath46which verify @xmath47 \\sim \\delta_{jk}$ ] .",
    "parameter @xmath48 has the dimension of mass .",
    "for a massive klein - gordon field , it is natural to take @xmath49 .",
    "indeed , one can alternatively generate the local observables algebra with the ladder operators : @xmath50their coarse - grained versions correspond to operators in with @xmath49 .",
    "we recall that the newton - wigner ( nw ) annihilation and creation operators are respectively defined as the fourier transforms of the momentum annihilation and creation operators @xcite : @xmath51the nw operators define a localization scheme @xcite and are expressed in terms of the local fields as follows : @xmath52 , \\\\",
    "\\hat a_{nw}^{\\dag}(x ) = &   \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\int dy\\left[r(x - y)\\hat \\phi(y ) -i r^{-1}(x - y)\\hat \\pi(y)\\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have introduced the functions : @xmath53operators @xmath54 annihilate the global vacuum , therefore the global vacuum is a product state of local vacua .",
    "more generally , if local degrees of freedom are associated with the nw operators instead of the standard local fields , entropy of entanglement of the vacuum state is zero and entropy of finite - energy states , such as thermal states , becomes finite @xcite .",
    "however , identifying local degrees of freedom with nw operators at a fundamental level is problematic : the hamiltonian of the field , expressed in terms of nw operators , is non - local .",
    "we do not address here the question of which localization scheme should be chosen at a fundamental level @xcite .",
    "instead we show that , under coarse graining , the entanglement properties of the nw fields for finite - energy states effectively hold , irrespective of the fundamental choice of local observables .",
    "we now compare the algebra of coarse - grained observables generated by with the algebra generated by the following coarse - grained nw operators : @xmath55 computations show that : @xmath56 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where : @xmath57 , \\\\                 r_{\\epsilon}(x)= & \\int dy g_{\\epsilon}(x - y)r(y ) ,",
    "\\\\      r^{-1}_{\\epsilon}(x)= & \\int dy g_{\\epsilon}(x - y)r^{-1}(y ) .",
    "\\end{split}\\]]in the limit of poor space resolution , the coarse - grained nw operators become indistinguishable from the coarse - grained local ladder operators since : @xmath58 , \\end{aligned}\\]]and in the limit where the minimal resolvable distances are much larger than the compton wavelength , @xmath59 , the gaussian @xmath60 verifies @xmath61 for @xmath62 and @xmath63 otherwise .",
    "thus , in we have to integrate only over small values of @xmath20 .",
    "we find : @xmath64 this result , plugged back into , gives : @xmath65 in the limit @xmath3 , the coarse - grained nw operators still annihilate the global vacuum , hence the latter is a product state of effective local vacua .",
    "equation then shows that the global vacuum is also a product state for the coarse - grained field operators .",
    "this implies that , in the limit of poor spatial resolution of detectors , an excitation localized  around point @xmath66 \" is effectively described by applying the creation operator @xmath67 to the global vacuum @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , any one - particle state @xmath69 can be effectively described as a sum @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is a function verifying @xmath72 and @xmath73 its fourier transform . as a consequence , such a state ( which can not be interpreted as localized in qft unless it has infinite energy )",
    "can now be properly interpreted as localized , allowing a mapping between the description of a region of space in qft and an effective description that only includes the nonrelativistic degrees of freedom therein contained .",
    "hence , the structure of entanglement of any state with a finite number of excitations reduces to the entanglement between localized particles , i.e. to the standard , nonrelativistic , picture of entanglement . in particular , the entropy of entanglement of such states is upper bounded by the number of excitations times a factor describing how many states are available to each excitation ( see the appendix ) . since finite - energy states correspond to states with a finite number of excitations , this result provides a controlled transition from the qft picture of entanglement of finite - energy states to the nonrelativistic quantum theory one .    as an example , consider two mesons or two atoms with integer spin in a singlet state localized  around points @xmath74 and @xmath66 \" . in the qft picture ,",
    "entanglement between the region  around point @xmath74 \" containing one meson with the rest of the system is infinite . under the constraint of a bounded spatial resolution of detectors ,",
    "the effective description of such a system in qft is : @xmath75|\\omega\\rangle \\\\ = & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(|0\\rangle_1\\cdots|0\\rangle_{i-1}|\\uparrow \\rangle_i|0\\rangle_{i+1}\\cdots|0\\rangle_{j-1 } |\\downarrow\\rangle_j |0\\rangle_{j+1}\\cdots\\right.\\\\ & \\left.+\\right|0\\rangle_1\\cdots|0\\rangle_{i-1}|\\downarrow \\rangle_i|0\\rangle_{i+1}\\cdots|0\\rangle_{j-1 } |\\uparrow\\rangle_j |0\\rangle_{j+1}\\cdots ) , \\end{aligned}\\]]which is formally equivalent to the state : @xmath76.\\]]the entropy of entanglement between the region  around @xmath74 \" and",
    "the rest of the system is then @xmath77 , which is the expected value when modeling this system in nonrelativistic quantum theory .",
    "note that by symmetry @xmath78 .",
    "we have shown that in the limit of poor spatial resolution of the detectors , the entropy of entanglement of finite - energy states of a massive klein - gordon field reduces to the one calculated in nonrelativistic quantum theory .",
    "the derivation was independent of any effective low - energy model for the detectors .",
    "the results of this paper can be generalized to all noncritical bosonic systems , i.e. systems endowed with a finite length scale such as lattice models or models with local interactions and an energy gap ( a natural length scale is then provided by the lattice spacing and the correlation length respectively ) @xcite .",
    "for critical systems , the correlation length diverges , hence different arguments are needed . for fermionic systems ,",
    "an ambiguity in the definition of entanglement measures between subsystems arises due to the anticommutation of the creation and annihilation operators @xcite .",
    "one can reformulate the problem of entanglement between localized subsystems in a purely algebraic way @xcite , and a possible extension of the coarse - graining procedure to the algebraic framework is under investigation .",
    "we thank aslav brukner , magdalena zych and federico piazza for helpful discussions .",
    "this work was supported by the european commission project q - essence ( no.248095 ) , the european commission project raquel , the john templeton foundation , fqxi , and the austrian science fund ( fwf ) through coqus , sfb foqus , and the individual project no.2462 .",
    "consider at fixed time a finite region of space @xmath0 and its complement @xmath1 .",
    "suppose that the field is in a state with @xmath79 excitations .",
    "@xmath0 is decomposed into @xmath80 distinct regions @xmath81 , whose points are assumed to be nonresolvable because of the limited spatial resolution of the detectors .",
    "an upper bound on the entropy of entanglement between subsystems @xmath0 and @xmath1 is given by the dimension of the subspace of an @xmath80-mode system containing any number of particles between 0 and @xmath79 : @xmath82 where : @xmath83is the dimension of the subspace with exactly @xmath84 particles .",
    "this provides an upper bound on the entropy of entanglement between @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the @xmath79-particle state : @xmath85 if @xmath86 , @xmath87 , expressing the fact that the entropy of entanglement of such states is upper bounded by the number of excitations times a factor describing how many states are available to each excitation .",
    "one can encode degrees of freedom other than position by changing the value of @xmath80 .",
    "for example , if two polarization states are available to each excitation , one must double the value of @xmath80 .",
