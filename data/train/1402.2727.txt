    "nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) is based on the resonant absorption of radio frequency ( rf ) electromagnetic radiation by nuclear spin - split states by a magnetic field .",
    "the absorption of rf  field is limited by small differences of the populations of the nuclear - spin states in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "therefore nmr requires probing of a macroscopically large number of nuclei ( @xmath0 )  @xcite .",
    "the nmr detection sensitivity can be greatly improved by preparing a nuclear - spin state with degree of polarization higher than the thermodynamic equilibrium value at a given magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "additional improvement is achieved by using optical methods to detect the state of the nuclear - spin system  @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of optically detected nmr was demonstrated for bulk semiconductors  @xcite , quantum wells  @xcite , and even quantum dots ( qds )  @xcite , containing @xmath1 nuclear spins only , thanks to the high values of dynamic nuclear - spin polarization ( dnp ) , of the order of tens percent , that can be achieved in qds by optical pumping  @xcite .    for self - assembled qds",
    "the observation of nmr is complicated by the large spread of parameters in a qd ensemble  @xcite .",
    "usually , single qd spectroscopy is used to diminish this spread  @xcite . however",
    ", a considerable broadening of the resonances remains even at the single qd level  @xcite .",
    "the main origin of this broadening in self - assembled qds is the inhomogeneous quadrupole splitting of the nuclear - spin states by the strain - induced gradient of crystal field within a dot  @xcite .",
    "the broadening results in overlapping resonances from the same and from different isotopes , making their identification difficult .    here ,",
    "we show that such an identification is nevertheless possible .",
    "we investigate two samples with self - assembled ( in , ga)as / gaas qds grown by the stranski - krastanov method and annealed at different temperatures .",
    "the annealing gives rise to a decrease of the deformation of the crystal lattice , caused by the mismatch of the qd and barrier lattices and , hence , to a decrease of the inhomogeneous quadrupole splitting of nuclear states .",
    "we make use of polarization modulation of the optical pumping of the dots .",
    "such modulation has been the common basis for the all - optical nmr technique  @xcite . as the hyperfine interaction of nuclei with oriented electron spins",
    "can be described as an effective magnetic field ( the knight field ) acting on the nuclei  @xcite , the modulation of this field caused by the modulated optical pumping is similar to the action of an rf field  @xcite .",
    "optical detection of nmr under light - polarization modulation brings about a resonance cooling of nuclear spins or , in other words , a cooling of nuclear spin system in the rotating frame  @xcite .",
    "the effect was observed in a magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the excitation light beam ( voigt geometry ) .",
    "resonance cooling results in appearance of overhauser field oriented parallel or antiparallel to the static magnetic field  @xcite .    in our study",
    "we exploit another resonant effect connected with the modulation of the polarization of the optical pumping as described in ref .  .",
    "if the modulation frequency coincides with that of a nuclear - spin precession about the magnetic field , considerable nuclear - spin polarization perpendicular to the magnetic field appears in the system .",
    "this dnp component favorably increases the electron - spin polarization monitored in the experiment . as a result , additional maxima associated with the nuclear resonances",
    "appear in the magnetic field dependence of the electron spin polarization , i.e. , in the hanle curve . to accurately determine the positions of these nuclear resonances ,",
    "we have measured the hanle curves at different modulation frequencies varied from units of kilohertz up to of about @xmath2  mhz . an rf field synchronized with the optical modulation",
    "was applied to magnify the resonant effects .",
    "identification of the different resonances was done by a theoretical analysis based on modeling the quadrupole - zeeman splitting of the nuclear - spin states .",
    "comparison of the calculated results with the experimental data allows us to identify several resonances corresponding to transitions between the states characterized by spin projection @xmath3 for all the nuclei contained in the qds and by @xmath4 for the in and ga nuclei . besides , resonances with transitions between the higher spin - projection states , @xmath5 , for the in nuclei and between the states having different projections , @xmath6 , for the in and ga nuclei were identified .",
    "the large broadening of resonances is confirmed to be caused by the spread of strain within the qds .",
    "we study a heterostructure containing 20 layers of self - assembled ( in , ga)as qds sandwiched between gaas barriers .",
    "the barriers are @xmath7-doped by donors with a concentration , which supplies every dot with , on average , a single resident electron after the donor ionization .",
    "the structure was grown by molecular - beam epitaxy on a ( 001)-oriented gaas substrate .",
    "rapid thermal post - growth annealing of the structure provides inter - diffusion of indium and gallium atoms between the qds and gaas barriers so that the nominally pure inas qds are partially enriched by the in - diffusion of ga atoms which increases the band gap , resulting in a blue shift of the ground qd optical transition  @xcite .",
    "the annealing also causes a decrease of built - in strain in the qds that is an important source of the quadrupole splitting of the nuclear - spin states .",
    "we study two pieces of this structure annealed at @xmath8  c ( sample  1 ) and at @xmath9  c ( sample  2 ) .",
    "the samples were placed in a cryostat with a superconducting magnet such that the magnetic field could be applied perpendicular to the structure growth axis ( voigt geometry ) coinciding with the @xmath10 $ ] crystallographic axis .",
    "the experiments were performed at a sample temperature @xmath11  k.            to detect dnp , we look over the circular polarization of the pl from the qds . to excite the qds we use a continuous - wave ti : sapphire laser , which photon energy is tuned to the optical transition of the wetting - layer exciton .",
    "the ground - state pl is dispersed by a half - metre spectrometer and is detected with a silicon avalanche photodiode .",
    "the degree of circular polarization of the pl , @xmath12 , is measured using a photo elastic modulator operated at a frequency of @xmath13  khz and a two - channel photon - counting system . here",
    ", @xmath14 is the pl intensity for co- ( cross- ) polarization relative to that of excitation . in the maximum of pl band of the qds ,",
    "the polarization is negative ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pl ] ) and reflects the mean spin polarization of the resident electrons along the optical axis ( @xmath15  axis ) , as has been extensively discussed earlier  @xcite . due to the interaction of the resident electrons with the qd nuclei , the negative circular polarization ( ncp )",
    "can be used as a sensitive tool to monitor the nuclear spin state  @xcite .    in our experiments",
    ", the helicity of the optical excitation was periodically modulated between @xmath16 and @xmath17 by an electro - optical modulator followed by a quarter - wave plate .",
    "in addition , an rf field was applied by means of a small coil oriented parallel to the optical @xmath15  axis .",
    "the rf - field frequency coinciding with the frequency of optical modulation was fixed , while the hanle curves were measured by scanning the magnetic field .",
    "the pl of the qds at low excitation density shows a broad emission contributed mostly by the ground state optical transition but also the first excited state transition shows up on the high - energy flank , see fig .",
    "[ fig : pl ] .",
    "we focus here on the behavior observed for the lowest transition .",
    "the corresponding emission line has the half - width at half - maximum of about 10  mev , centered at 1.418  ev for sample  1 and 1.337  ev for sample  2 .",
    "the ncp is observed across the whole emission line with a peak amplitude reaching 30% at optimal excitation density , which is about 30  w/@xmath18 for sample  1 and three times larger for sample  2 .",
    "the analysis shows  @xcite that the upper limit of ncp is determined by the fraction of qds containing a single resident electron .",
    "optimization of the excitation density allows one to fully polarize the electrons .",
    "note that the ncp is found to depend very sensitively on any residual magnetic field adding to the external field applied in the voigt geometry .",
    "therefore the residual magnetic fields including the earth magnetic field were carefully compensated in our experiment by means of helmholtz coils .",
    "magnetic - field dependencies of ncp were measured at the pl maximum for different frequencies of polarization modulation of the excitation .",
    "all hanle curves presented in this paper were obtained by scanning the magnetic field in one direction , defined here as from negative to positive values . as an example , the hanle curves for sample  1 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hanle ] .",
    "the hanle curve measured with nonmodulated polarization of the excitation ( black line ) contains the so - called w - structure , which consists of a very narrow central peak and two maxima separated from the peak by dips .",
    "the appearance of the w - structure results from polarization of this nuclear spins along the magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "when the polarization of excitation is modulated , the hanle curve becomes strongly modified . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : hanle ] , the central peak drastically broaden and additional intense maxima appear .",
    "they move to higher magnetic fields with increasing modulation frequency .",
    "the frequency dependence indicates the resonant nature of the maxima .",
    "the rapid decrease of their amplitude at higher frequencies does not allow , however , to observe them in wide frequency range , which aggravates their identification .    to increase the amplitude of the resonant peaks in the hanle curves and to extend the range of transverse magnetic fields , in which the peaks can be observed , we applied to the sample an alternating rf magnetic field of small amplitude along the optical axis .",
    "the frequency of the alternating field was identical to that of the modulation of the optical excitation .",
    "the phase difference , @xmath19 , between the polarization and rf modulations was varied .",
    "the effect of the rf  field on the hanle curve for sample  1 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] .",
    "obviously , the effect strongly depends on @xmath19  @xcite . at some optimal @xmath19 ,",
    "the wings of the hanle curve are greatly increased and the overall width of the curve is strongly enlarged  @xcite .",
    "phase inversion of the rf field relative to the optimal case results in the opposite effect ",
    "the additional wings almost disappear and only the central part of the hanle curve survives . for intermediate @xmath19 , an additional structure appears in the hanle curve , indicating asynchronous magnification or suppression of the different resonances .",
    "this non - synchronicity facilitates the separation of resonances .",
    "similar experiments were done for sample  2 where the hanle curves are considerably wider due to the stronger quadrupole interaction .",
    "the effect of the rf field for this sample is similar to the one for sample  1 .          as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] , the wings of the hanle curve in most cases are rather smooth due to the large resonance broadening , whose origin we will discuss below . therefore , to uniquely identify the position of the nmr resonances for different nuclei isotopes , we measured a set of hanle curves at different modulation frequencies @xmath20 and phase differences @xmath19 .",
    "the amplitude of the rf field has been chosen to be relatively small ( fraction of millitesla ) and has been optimized for the best separation of the resonances .",
    "the experimental data were compared then with the results of theoretical modeling of the zeeman splittings of the nuclear spin states in the qds in presence of strain .",
    "the analysis of the whole set of hanle curves measured at different modulation frequencies allowed us to identify the observed resonances , to retrieve the nuclear zeeman splittings , and to determine the nuclear quadrupole splittings for the studied samples .",
    "the results of this analysis are discussed below .",
    "an estimation of the crystal lattice deformation in qds annealed at different temperatures was given in ref .  .",
    "here , we give insight into the modeling of the strain - induced electric field gradient in the annealed qds .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : efg ] .    the annealing of the ( in , ga)as / gaas heterostructure initiates an interdiffusion of in and ga atoms followed by an increase of the qd size and a decrease of the in dot content .",

    "figure  [ fig : efg](a ) shows the cross - section of the resulting distribution of @xmath21 for the qd annealed at a temperature above @xmath24  c. it should be noted that the electron localization volume increases with annealing due to both , the increase of effective size of the dot and the decrease of the potential well depth for the conduction - band electron  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the strain in the qd crystal lattice , arising from the lattice mismatch of the qd and barrier materials , also changes with annealing .",
    "for modeling the quadrupole - zeeman splittings of the nuclear sublevels in the qds , it is important to account for the component of biaxial strain , defined as @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "this component relaxes from the average value of @xmath26 in the unannealed qd down to @xmath27 ( sample 1 ) and @xmath28 ( sample 2 ) in the annealed qds , as calculations show .",

    "the crystal lattice deformation is enhanced within the qd and causes there the appearance of an electric field gradient ( efg ) at nuclear sites .",

    "the resulting distributions @xmath76 for the in and ga nuclei are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_th ] .",
    "as one can see , the distributions are relatively wide , which supports the assumption of strain non - homogeneity within the qd as primary source of the resonance broadening shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : statistics ] .",
    "there is a strong asymmetry of the distribution with an abrupt right edge , which corresponds to the maximal value of @xmath29 in the middle of the qd . the experimentally obtained distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : statistics ] is more symmetric , which is possibly due to smoothing of the distribution in the qd ensemble .",
    "there is also some difference in the values @xmath91 for @xmath43ga and @xmath44 in averaged over the corresponding statistics .",
    "the in content is maximal in the qd middle where the efg is also maximal so that the distribution for the in nuclei is shifted to larger values of @xmath29 relative to those for the ga nuclei .",
    "this result correlates well with the experimental observations , see fig .",
    "[ fig : statistics ] .",
    "the broadening of the resonance peaks for the transitions @xmath63 requires some further consideration .",
    "this broadening is considerably smaller than that for the transitions @xmath64 .",
    "however , it is still much larger than the one typically observed in solid state nmr  @xcite . to understand the possible origin of this broadening",
    "we should consider the zeeman splitting of the states @xmath58 in presence of quadrupole splitting .",
    "when the magnetic field is small and mostly perpendicular to the principal axis of the efg , the splitting is given by  @xcite @xmath92,\\ ] ] where @xmath93 is the zeeman splitting of the states @xmath58 in absence of strain and @xmath94 is the quadrupole splitting of the nuclear - spin states into doublets corresponding to @xmath58 and @xmath95 . clearly , when @xmath96 , the splitting @xmath97 is approximately twice larger than the zeeman splitting and almost independent of the deformation .",
    "this means that the spread of @xmath29 can not be responsible for the observed broadening .",
    "we have to assume that the broadening is caused by a deviation of the principle axis of the efg from the direction orthogonal to the magnetic - field .",
    "one possible reason for that is an asymmetry of the qds in the ensemble due to the statistical nature of the assembly of atoms in the qds during the growth process .",
    "another reason might be the inclination of the deformation axis at peripheral parts of the qds  @xcite . note that even a relatively small inclination of the axis may cause a remarkable shift of the resonance position .",
    "indeed , when the efg axis is parallel to the magnetic field ( inclination is @xmath61 ) , the splitting of the @xmath58 states becomes twice smaller and corresponds to the ordinary zeeman splitting , @xmath98 .",
    "therefore the spread of inclinations of the efg axis in the qd ensemble can be responsible for the observed broadening of the resonances @xmath99 .",
    "to conclude , the obtained results demonstrate that resonant optical pumping of the electron - nuclear spin system in qds subject to transverse magnetic fields is an efficient tool for studying transition between nuclear spin states split by a magnetic field . using this method , we managed to experimentally detect a number of resonances of the in , ga , and as nuclei in an inhomogeneous qd ensemble , namely those corresponding to the transitions between the @xmath100 , @xmath84 , and @xmath101 states as well as to the transitions between the @xmath102 and @xmath103 states .",
    "the comparison of experimental data recorded on ( in , ga)as / gaas qd samples annealed at different temperatures show that the resonant frequencies strongly depend on the strain of the crystal lattice in the qds .",
    "the strain - induced efg at the nuclear sites splits the nuclear spin states with non - zero quadrupole moment resulting in a remarkable modification of the nmr spectrum .",
    "our model considering zeeman splitting of the nuclear states in presence of quadrupolar interaction has been developed .",
    "it allows us to identify all the observed resonances .",
    "essentially , the model having only one free parameter , @xmath29 , allows one to satisfactorily describe the magnetic field dependences of the resonant frequencies observed .",
    "the obtained values , @xmath104 for sample  1 annealed at @xmath105  c and @xmath106 for sample  2 annealed at @xmath107  c , are in good agreement with those obtained theoretically from the qd structure modeling .",
    "we have also found that the resonances are broadened in qds much stronger than in bulk crystals and quantum wells . in particular , this is valid for the split - off resonances @xmath108 , and @xmath109 .",
    "our analysis shows that the main origin of the resonance broadening is related to the spread of the biaxial strain , @xmath29 .",
    "the value of the spread is of the order of @xmath29 itself .",
