    "@xcite , this is only true for the leading ( logarithmically divergent ) part , because there is no simple reason why the microscopic length scales @xmath281 should all be the same .",

    "@xcite mentioned that the entanglement entropy of a disk @xmath275 of radius @xmath247 embedded in a larger disk @xmath282 of radius @xmath110 could have a ( very slowly ) diverging term @xmath288 for a critical rk wave function .",
    "however , in the lattice ( dimer ) version of the rk state we consider , it is easy to show that the entropy must be finite when @xmath130 while keeping @xmath247 fixed .",
    "the argument is as follows : the ( von neumann ) entropy @xmath227 of a subsystem can be expressed using the probabilities @xmath59 of its boundary configurations : @xmath289 where @xmath290 is the number of possible microscopic configurations at the boundary of @xmath275 .",

    "but in any case @xmath295 can not diverge when taking @xmath296 at fixed @xmath247 , whatever the lattice rk state provided it has a finite number of states per site .",
    "this is indeed confirmed by our numerical estimations of @xmath295 which are performed directly in the thermodynamic limit @xmath297 and which gives finite values for finite values @xmath247 .",
    "although the system sizes ( @xmath247 ) are too small to observe the true large-@xmath247 behavior for @xmath2 ( square lattice ) , the argument above concerning the corner contribution indicate that it is very likely a non - universal number .",
    "thanks to some extensive use of the pfaffian solution of the classical ( 2d ) dimer model , we have performed exact calculations of the entanglement entropy and entanglement spectra of some dimer rk states on large subsystems . using the cylinder and the kitaev - preskill geometries we recovered the topological entanglement entropy of the @xmath11 phase , @xmath132 , with high accuracy .",
    "as expected , this value not only holds for the triangular lattice rk wave - function , but is in fact independent of the fugacity @xmath4 .",
    "we also analyzed the scaling close to the critical point at @xmath2 , as well as the behavior for large values of the rnyi index @xmath13 .",
    "in particular , we proved for @xmath298 that the sub - leading entropy constant is @xmath132 .",
    "thanks to its translation - invariant boundary , the cylinder geometry gives smaller finite - size effects and therefore a much more precise estimation of the topological entanglement entropy than the kp setup ( for a given length of the subsystem boundary ) .",
    "for this reason , it may be preferred in future numerical studies ( exact diagonalization or quantum monte carlo ) looking for topological ground states in realistic lattice models .",
    "the entanglement spectra were also computed in the cylinder geometry , and the presence of a unique ground - state and a finite gap ( whatever the fugacity ) showed that for these states , contrary to naive expectations , the topological ( or critical ) nature of the phase is not apparent in the low - energy part of the entanglement spectrum . simpler @xmath11 wave functions such as that of the toric code@xcite ( or that of ref .",
    "@xcite ) do not allow to learn much about the structure of the entanglement spectrum .",
    "indeed , in those states with vanishing correlation length all the non - zero eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix are exactly degenerate ( no @xmath13 dependence of the rnyi entropy ) . from this point of view , the dimer states we consider offer an interesting compromise between the possibility to do exact calculations on large systems and a non - trivial entanglement spectrum . extending these calculations to other states with richer topological structure , like string - nets wave functions @xcite , could be a promising direction of research .",
    "we wish to diagonalize the kasteleyn matrix by fourier transform for @xmath299 .",
    "to do so we must distinguish between two sublattices ( see fig .  [",
