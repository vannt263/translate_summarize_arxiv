    "we have compared the lists of the observed lines with a list , derived from morton 1991 , containing the most frequently seen lines in qso absorption spectra . as customary , we searched for significant excesses of identifications at all possible redshifts ( bahcall 1968 ) .",
    "all the identified heavy element systems present in the lyman-@xmath1 forest have been removed from the final sample , which consists of more than 1100 lyman-@xmath1 lines with observed column density @xmath7 . whenever possible , the lyman-@xmath51 forest has been used to constrain the number of components in the strong saturated lyman-@xmath1 blends as shown in fig . 1 .",
    "the s / n has been computed from the noise spectrum , and is typically greater than 10 per pixel element ( corresponding to 15 per resolution element ) . in the regions near the qso lyman-@xmath1 emissions",
    ", where the proximity effect is important , and for the brighter quasars the s / n raises to higher values @xmath52 , corresponding to s / n@xmath53 per resolution element .",
    "extensive simulations by various authors ( rauch et al .",
    "1993 , fontana & ballester 1995 ) show that no strong bias in the derived statistical distributions is expected when the s / n is @xmath2010 and @xmath54 .    we have complemented our data with other spectra available in the literature with similar resolution and redshift range obtaining a final sample of 10 qsos ( in the following referred to as _ extended sample _ ) , that is @xmath55% of the number of objects used by bechtold ( 1994 ) , but observed at resolution ten times higher .",
    "the average resolution ( @xmath57 ) of our extended sample corresponds , in terms of voigt profile fitting , to a minimum doppler parameter @xmath58 km s@xmath4 , which is equivalent to a temperature @xmath59 k and thus adequate to assess the photoionization state of the lyman-@xmath1 clouds .",
    "if we restrict our analysis to the two objects with the best s / n ratio ( 20 - 60 per resolution element ) , 0000 - 26 and 2126 - 158 ( fig.2 ) , we can obtain reliable measurements of the doppler profiles of the weak lines down to @xmath60 . in figs . 3 and 4 we show the @xmath56 distributions derived from 0000 - 26 and 2126 - 158 respectively , while fig .",
    "5 gives the histograms of the doppler parameter .",
    "these plots confirm the earlier result ( giallongo et al .",
    "1993 , cristiani et al . 1995 ) that the bulk of the line distribution lies in the @xmath22 region between 20 and 30 km s@xmath4 .",
    "there is a non - negligible fraction of lines with @xmath22 in the range 1020 km s@xmath4 , 18% and 17% for 0000 - 26 and 2126 - 158 respectively , with very few cases ( @xmath61% ) of lines with @xmath62 km s@xmath4 , which may be representative of unrecognized metal lines .",
    "since the profile fitting of narrow lines with @xmath63 can be affected by systematic errors due to the present s / n ( rauch et al . 1993 ) we have computed the same fraction for lines with @xmath64 finding 16% and 15% in both spectra . in any case",
    ", the fraction of low - b lines appears to be uncorrelated with the s / n .",
    "it is well known ( e.g. pettini et al .",
    "1990 , donahue & shull 1991 ) that doppler @xmath22 values corresponding to temperatures @xmath65 k are difficult to reconcile with sizes greater than 50 kpc .",
    "giallongo & petitjean 1994 emphasized the importance of inverse compton cooling by the cosmic microwave background radiation and of a steepening of the ionizing background at wavelengths shorter than the heii edge to get sufficient cooling rate to obtain temperatures as low as @xmath66 k with sizes up to @xmath67 kpc .",
    "in all these analyses both photoionization and thermal equilibrium were assumed , neglecting explicit time dependence of the photoionization mechanisms , which may be important at redshifts @xmath68 .",
    "ferrara & giallongo 1995 recently developed a time dependent photoionization code that follows the thermal history of the photoionized gas with total density @xmath69 @xmath70 out of the ionization and thermal equilibrium .",
    "they show that it is possible to get temperatures as low as 15000 k at @xmath713 provided that the ionization starts at redshifts appreciably higher than 7 and that the uvb has a jump at the heii edge by a factor of the order of 100 .",
    "this corresponds to minimum doppler values of the order of @xmath72 km s@xmath4 , consistent with the minimum values observed in our sample .",
    "thus , the existence of narrow lines in the lyman-@xmath1 population may become a sensitive tool to constrain the epoch of reionization and the shape of the uvb .",
    "the column density distribution of the lines in our extended sample at a distance larger than 8 mpc from the qsos is shown in fig .",
    "6 , in which the line density has been normalized at @xmath73 .",
    "a double power - law distribution clearly appears with a break at @xmath74 . below the break the slope",
    "is very flat ( @xmath75 ) down to our selection threshold @xmath76 . above the break",
    "the slope is steep with @xmath77 .",
    "there are two main biases that do alter the shape of the column density distribution .",
    "strong saturated lines above the break often show complex structures , but independently of the s / n , these features can not be deblended without information on the lyman-@xmath51 forest , which are often outside the observed range or heavily contaminated by lower-@xmath48 lyman-@xmath1 lines .",
    "the distribution of the lines below the break is affected by the so - called `` line - blanketing '' effect , due to high column density lines that conceal weak lines . in order to quantify and correct this effect , which becomes more and more important at higher redshifts",
    ", we have performed extensive simulations with the fitlyman code , trying to mimic the blanketing process .",
    "each set of simulations was performed by progressively merging two lines ( a `` weak '' and a `` strong '' line ) of given parameters : fig .",
    "7a shows an example at s / n=10 . at each separation ,",
    "a profile fit with a single component was attempted .",
    "we have defined the critical separation as the distance for which the fit turns out to be acceptable in the 50% of trials ( about 0.7  in this case , see fig .",
    "7b ) . at smaller separations , with the assigned s / n ratio , resolution and redshift , the weak line is definitely lost . in figs .",
    "7c , d a similar simulation is shown for a line pair with larger @xmath22 parameters . as expected , in this case the critical separation is larger , @xmath78  .",
    "this critical separation , which is a function of several parameters ( the s / n ratio , the doppler parameters of the lines and their column densities , the average absorption redshift and the resolution ) was computed for a grid in the parameter space corresponding to the available data . in this way we have been able to quantify the effects of the blanketing on the line selection function .",
    "lines with @xmath79 are lost in the @xmath8035% of the observed redshift interval at @xmath81 , in the @xmath8017% at @xmath82 and in the @xmath8011% at @xmath83 .",
    "the effects of this correction on the column density distribution are shown in fig .",
    "6 ( dashed histogram ) , where the number density of the lines in the different column density bins has been normalized to the effective redshift range derived for each qso spectrum .",
    "the change in slope is still present and well represented by a double power - law , although the average slope below the break is increased to @xmath84 , a value consistent with previous estimates obtained at lower redshifts ( giallongo et al .",
    "1993 , cristiani et al . 1995 ) where line blanketing effects are less important .",

    "the lyman limit population is virtually indistinguishable from the population selected by the presence of mgii absorption which is found to be associated with the internal parts of the galaxy halos ( bergeron & boiss 1991 ) . from the statistics of the galaxies responsible for the mgii absorptions it is possible to derive an average radius of the order of 40 kpc ( steidel 1995 ) .    for the damped systems , typical hi column densities",

    "appear remarkably similar , as shown in fig .",
    "also their cosmological evolutions appear consistent in the overall redshift range .",
    "thus , it is tempting to interpret the lyman-@xmath1 clouds with @xmath94 as gas associated with the outer regions of the same class of galaxies responsible for the lyman limit and damped systems .",
    "a lyman-@xmath1-galaxy association was originally proposed by bahcall & spitzer 1969 and it is now statistically suggested at low redshift by imaging of the galaxy - fields surrounding qsos ( lanzetta et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "a scenario of this kind is in agreement with the observations of metallicities of the order of @xmath95 in the lyman-@xmath1 clouds ( cowie et al .",
    "1995 , tytler & fan 1995 ) and also with the detection of clustering of the lyman-@xmath1 clouds with @xmath93 ( cristiani et al . 1995 ; meiksin & bouchet 1995 )",
    ".    the lyman-@xmath1 absorptions with @xmath96 ( the flat part of the column density distribution ) , would be in part associated with galaxies and in part due to fluctuations of a clumpy intergalactic medium .",
    "we can parameterize the line distribution far away from the qsos as a function of the column density and redshift :    @xmath97    near the qso , highly ionized clouds are observed with a column density @xmath98 i.e. the ratio between the intrinsic column density @xmath99 , which the same cloud would have at infinite distance from the qso , and the factor @xmath100 , where : @xmath101 is the ratio between the flux @xmath102 that the cloud receives from the qso and the flux @xmath103 that the cloud receives from the general uvb ( see bajtlik et al . 1988 and bechtold 1994 for details of the model ) .    adopting the following conservation law near the qso emission redshift we have @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the column density distributions near the qso and at infinite distance .",
    "we have used the following double power - law distribution to get a simultaneous estimate of the lyman-@xmath1 parameters of the @xmath21 , @xmath48 distributions _ and _ of the uv background @xmath107 evaluated at the lyman limit .",
    "@xmath108 where @xmath109 is the observed break , which is shifted to lower and lower @xmath21 as the qso emission redshift is approached ,    it is clear from the previous equation that the measure of @xmath103 depends critically on the estimates of @xmath110 , because the bulk of the lines comes from this part of the distribution , and on @xmath111 .",
    "for this reason , it is not strictly correct to separate the analysis of the lyman-@xmath1 line distribution from the estimate of @xmath103 , as done in previous analyses performed at lower resolution , and a maximum likelihood analysis which adopts the line distribution given in eq .",
    "5 has to be used .",
    "a similar approach has been adopted by kulkarni and fall 1993 using low redshifts hst spectra .",
    "however , their data are at low resolution and they derived column densities from a curve of growth analysis assuming an average doppler parameter for all the lines and a single power - law @xmath21 distribution .    in table 2 we have reported the result of the ml analysis .",
    "the redshift evolution is confirmed at about the same level previously found at lower resolution ( e.g lu , wolfe & turnshek 1991 , bechtold 1994 ) . the column density distribution is well represented by a double power - law , as already shown in fig .",
    "6 , with a very flat slope below the break at @xmath112 .",
    "another important result concerns the uv background derived from the proximity effect that appears definitely smaller than previously reported , i.e. @xmath113 in the redshift interval @xmath8 .",
    "the redshifts adopted in table 1 are derived from low ionization lines ( oi , mgii , h@xmath1 ) , which are representative of the true systemic redshift of the qso ( gaskell 1982 , espey et al .",
    "1989 ) . using high ionization lines ( e.g. civ , siiv etc . ) , which typically provide a smaller redshift , would result in an overestimate of the value of the uv background derived from the proximity effect by a factor of @xmath114 ( espey 1993 , bechtold 1994 ) .    as apparent in equation 5 ,",
    "the value of @xmath103 is sensitive to the precise value of @xmath115 .",
    "thus , it is important to apply a blanketing correction below the break of the column density distribution . to this end",
    ", we have introduced for each spectrum in the maximum likelihood analysis an effective redshift range which is a function of column density and redshift , as defined in the section 2.3 .",
    "the result is shown in table 3 : the correction for the blanketing effects increases the rate of the redshift evolution and steepens the column density distribution below the break . because of these changes , the intrinsic number density of lines far away from the qsos increases especially at high redshifts , and this in turn causes a decrement of the value of the uv background derived from the proximity effect down to @xmath116 .",
    "we have repeated the ml analysis allowing for a power - law redshift evolution of the uvb of the kind @xmath117 the best fit slope @xmath118 shown in table 3 is negative but consistent with no evolution in the redshift interval @xmath119 , although the uncertainties are still large .",
    "the present statistical analysis , based on the ml formalism , allows an accurate measure of the uv background , even if systematic biases could be present .",
    "bechtold 1994 gave a comprehensive discussion of the various systematic errors possibly affecting any estimate of the uvb .",
    "one of the main source of errors concerns the assumption of the same spectral shape for the uvb and the spectrum of the individual qsos , which is implicit in the bajtlik et al .",
    "1988 model .",
    "bechtold 1994 , comparing the ionization rate due to an uvb produced by qsos alone with the one produced by the sum of qsos and primeval galaxies , estimated small changes ( @xmath120% ) in the ratio of the ionization rates .",
    "recent measurements of heii lyman-@xmath1 absorption in qso spectra ( jakobsen et al .",
    "1994 , davidsen et al .",
    "1995 ) show that a strong decrease , i.e. a `` jump '' by a factor @xmath121 , in the shape of the uvb should be present just above the heii edge ( 4 rydberg ) . however ,",
    "detailed lyman-@xmath1 photoionization models by ferrara & giallongo 1995 show that , even in this case , no appreciable changes in the hydrogen ionization fractions are present either including or excluding the jump in the spectral shape of the uv background .",
    "thus the assumption of the simple power - law shape adopted in this paper and in bechtold 1994 remains a valid approximation .",
    "other biases such as magnification by gravitational lensing could be present for some qsos , but the statistical effect is expected to be be small ( bechtold 1994 ) , on the ground of the correlation of the proximity effect with luminosity and not with redshift .",
    "qso variability on a time scale of the order of the photoionization time ( @xmath122 yr ) could also affect the estimate of the proximity effect , but the result should simply be an increase in the statistical variance of our measure without changing the average value .",
    "the value of @xmath103 so derived is a factor of 6 lower than previous estimates ( e.g. bechtold 1994 ) from data at low resolution using the same simple model .",
    "this difference can be ascribed essentially to the assumption of a single power - law distribution with the canonical slope @xmath123 adopted by bechtold 1994 and to the blanketing effects which are stronger at low resolution .",
    "the new value we have found is remarkably close to the one predicted for the integrated contribution of qsos , in particular once dust obscuration of the qso population ( meiksin & madau 1993 ; fall & pei 1995 ) is taken into account .",
    "following the line of argument described in giallongo et al .",
    "1994 , we can use the @xmath124 value of @xmath125 together with the @xmath126 @xmath127 upper limit for the gp optical depth at @xmath128 , to derive a value for the density of the diffuse part of the intergalactic medium , which turns out to be rather low , @xmath129 .",
    "a sample of absorption lines has been extracted from the spectra of 6 qsos taken at an average resolution of 11 km s@xmath4 over the absorption redshift range @xmath2 .",
    "merging these data with those of 4 other qsos with observations of similar quality available in the literature has provided a relatively large lyman-@xmath1 sample ( more than 1100 lines ) , to which a maximum likelihood analysis has been applied to estimate simultaneously the best fit parameters of the lyman-@xmath1 clouds statistics and the intensity of the uvb background in the redshift interval @xmath8 .      1 .   from the subsample of lyman-@xmath1 lines from the spectra at higher s / n we derive , in the range @xmath130 , a typical doppler parameter in the range @xmath3 km s@xmath4 and estimate a fraction @xmath131% of lines with @xmath132 km s@xmath4 , corresponding to average temperatures @xmath133 k , still consistent with models of low density , highly ionized clouds .",

    "<S> a maximum likelihood analysis has been applied to estimate _ simultaneously _ the best fit parameters of the lyman-@xmath1 statistics _ and _ of the uv background . after correcting for the blanketing of weak lines , we confirm that the column density distribution is best represented by a double power - law with a break at @xmath9 , with a slope @xmath10 for higher column densities and a flatter slope @xmath11 below the break .    a value @xmath12 erg @xmath13 s@xmath4 hz@xmath4 sr@xmath4 is derived for the uv background in the redshift interval @xmath8 , consistent with the predicted qso contribution . </S>",

    "<S> the comoving volume density distributions of protogalactic damped systems , lyman limit systems and lyman-@xmath1 clouds with @xmath14 and radii @xmath15 kpc are found to be similar , suggesting a possible common association with galaxies .       </S>",
