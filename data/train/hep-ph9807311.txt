    "for an electron projectile the distributions ( [ dsigcoul ] ) and ( [ dsigcouly ] ) remain valid changing @xmath120 .",
    "however , in these distributions as well as in the born contributions one has to take into account the effect of the identity of the final state electrons and the bremsstrahlung mechanism of the @xmath0pair production ( according to @xcite this changes the result only slightly ) .    for pion and proton projectiles in the basic formulae the number of photons should be changed ( besides the trivial mass replacements ) .",
