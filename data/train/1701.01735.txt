    "this enhancement , known as deuterium fractionation , is favored at low temperatures because of the lower zero - point energies of the deuterated forms of the molecular ions that initiate the formation pathways of many ism molecules @xcite .",
    "deuterium fractionation starts from a limited number of exchange reactions , such as @xcite :    @xmath6    the zero - point energy of h@xmath7d@xmath1 is lower than that of h@xmath8 by @xmath9 k. @xcite , while the zero - point energy of ch@xmath7d@xmath1 is lower than that of ch@xmath8 by @xmath10 to 1200 k @xcite .",
    "( note that while there is also a zero - point energy difference between hd and h@xmath7 , the differences for the molecular ions are large enough such that the overall reactions are still exothermic . )",
    "h@xmath7d@xmath1 becomes abundant below @xmath3 30 k , both because of the increased difficulty of overcoming the energy barrier to re - form h@xmath8 from h@xmath7d@xmath1 ( @xmath11230 k ) and because of the freezeout of molecules that can destroy h@xmath7d@xmath1 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ". however , reactions [ eq : ch2d+ ] and [ eq : c2hd+ ] are more exothermic than reaction [ eq : h2d+ ] , with @xmath12 ranging from 480 to 660 k for [ eq : ch2d+ ] @xcite and @xmath13 k for [ eq : c2hd+ ] @xcite . hence , ch@xmath7d@xmath1 and c@xmath7hd@xmath1 survive more easily in warmer gas compared to h@xmath7d@xmath1 , but the reverse reactions for [ eq : ch2d+ ] and [ eq : c2hd+ ] occur readily above @xmath380 k , so ch@xmath7d@xmath1 and c@xmath7hd@xmath1 dominate over h@xmath7d@xmath1 between 30 and 80 k @xcite .",

    "detailed discussions of their formation pathways are provided in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",

    "the disk models presented in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite predict that the major hcn formation mechanisms proceed in the gas phase through small hydrocarbons or their cations :    @xmath17    and    @xmath18    and    @xmath19    the roles of these pathways in interstellar hcn formation were previously described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "based on laboratory experiments , hydrogenation on grains has also been proposed as an hcn formation pathway in the interstellar medium ( @xcite ) , but assessing the degree to which such a mechanism would influence hcn abundances in disks would require additional chemical modeling .",

    ", dcn is expected to peak in abundance at higher gas temperatures than dco@xmath1 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the models discussed so far suggest that _ in situ _ disk fractionation chemistry sets the molecular abundance profile , especially for dco@xmath1 .",
    "consequently , due to the different temperature dependences of the primary dcn and dco@xmath1 formation pathways , the two molecules are presumed to trace different regions of protoplanetary disks .",
    "the vertical structure of a protoplanetary disk consists of a cold midplane in which volatile species freeze out onto dust grains , a warm molecular layer above the midplane , and a surface layer in which high uv radiation leads to photodissociation of molecules @xcite . as a result , disk models typically predict that dco@xmath1 exists mostly near the cold midplane of the outer disk , while dcn peaks in abundance in the warmer interior regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this picture of spatially differentiated dcn and dco@xmath1 distributions in disks is qualitatively consistent with observations of dcn and dco@xmath1 in the tw hya and hd 163296 disks , the only protoplanetary disks in which sufficiently resolved observations have previously been published for both molecules @xcite .",
    "models suggest , though , that such distributions are not necessarily universal in disks .",
    "based on recent upward revisions of the exothermicity for reaction [ eq : ch2d+ ] , which indicate that ch@xmath7d@xmath1 may be abundant up to gas temperatures of 300 k @xcite , @xcite proposed that the primary formation mechanisms for dco@xmath1 in disks could instead be @xmath22 and @xmath23 where ch@xmath24d@xmath1 is derived from ch@xmath7d@xmath1 .",
    "dco@xmath1 would then no longer be limited to the cold outer disk midplane , and could instead be abundant in the inner disk .",
    "another reaction that could produce dco@xmath1 in the warm inner disk is @xcite : @xmath25    furthermore , the following two pathways have been proposed for dcn production in cold gas @xcite :    [ dcn_cold_1 ] @xmath26    and    [ dcn_cold_2 ] @xmath27    where d@xmath8 formation is initiated by h@xmath7d@xmath1 .",
    "if these alternative pathways are active in disks , the distributions of dcn and dco@xmath1 may not always show the differentiation that has been observed in the tw hya and hd 163296 disks .",
    "another motivation for examining deuterium fractionation in a range of disk types is that most theoretical studies of protoplanetary disk chemistry have been based on models of full t tauri disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more theoretical attention has recently been paid to the chemistry of transition disks and disks around herbig ae stars , but has not yet directly addressed deuterium fractionation @xcite .",
    "the radiation fields and temperature structures of transition disks and herbig ae disks may lead to substantially different chemistry ; the presence of a gap in a transition disk increases the exposure of the outer disk midplane to radiation from the central star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while herbig ae stars have higher uv fluxes , lower x - ray fluxes , and warmer disks than t tauri stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "herbig ae and t tauri stars may also have differing wind levels , which can affect cosmic - ray ionization and accretion in disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , it is useful to examine the generalizability of existing disk models by seeking observational constraints on how the abundance profiles of deuterated molecules may be linked to spectral type and overall disk morphology .    to explore the distribution patterns of dcn and dco@xmath1 in protoplanetary disks",

    "furthermore , even though mwc 480 and hd 163296 are chemically rich , observations of other herbig ae stars suggest that their disks tend to be more chemically poor than those around t tauri stars , perhaps because the higher uv luminosities of herbig ae stars lead to more photodissociation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

[ dcop_1 ] ) in the cold outer disk .    in our survey , we observe the following relationships between dcn and dco@xmath1 emission :    1 .   substantial spatial differentiation between dcn and dco@xmath1 in the v4046 sgr and hd 163296 disks . in these sources ,",
    "dcn is much more compact and peaks in intensity within the central gap of dco@xmath1 emission .",

    "2 .   similar radial extents for dcn and dco@xmath1 emission in the as 209 and lkca 15 disks . this may be indicative of more overlap in the formation pathways for dcn and dco@xmath1 in these disks than in the v4046 sgr , hd 163296 , or tw hya disks .",
    "ambiguous relationship due to the dcn detections with low signal - to - noise ratios in the i m lup and mwc 480 disks .",
    "dcn and dco@xmath1 are not necessarily co - spatial in the disks in which they have similar emission profiles , since it is possible that they are confined to different heights .",
    "even so , the results indicate that the inner disk / outer disk tracer dichotomy that was previously suggested for dcn and dco@xmath1 by the tw hya and hd 163296 data does not apply to all disks .",
    "the dcn emission profile in the lkca 15 disk is particularly interesting , since it appears to peak once near the central star and again at @xmath3 180 au .",
    "fitting a vertically isothermal model to co isotopologue observations , @xcite derived a gas temperature of @xmath209 k at 100 au from the central star . while this method may lead to imprecise temperature values due to real disks having vertical temperature gradients",
    ", the effect would likely be to overestimate rather than underestimate the temperature at which dcn resides , since @xmath151co typically probes the upper regions of the warm molecular layer .",
    "therefore , much of the dcn emission in the lkca 15 disk originates from disk regions expected to be too cold for ch@xmath7d@xmath1 to be the dominant deuterated ion , which suggests that an h@xmath7d@xmath1 formation pathway is a significant contributor in the outer lkca 15 disk .",
    "the marginal detection of dcn in the i m lup disk appears to be similarly extended into the cold outer disk , but more sensitive observations would be necessary to confirm this .    unlike lkca 15 , which has a gas disk estimated to extend to @xmath3900 au @xcite , the tw hya gas disk only extends to @xmath3215 au @xcite .",
    "the tw hya disk may simply not have enough material in its outer regions for a cold dcn formation pathway to be important .",
    "an alternative scenario is that radial drift in the lkca 15 disk creates a radial thermal inversion allowing for the warm ch@xmath7d@xmath1 pathway to produce dcn just outside the millimeter dust disk @xcite .",
    "then , other disks exhibiting evidence of radial drift , such as tw hya and as 209 @xcite , might be expected to show similar dcn emission , but they do not at the current sensitivity .",

    "ring - like distributions have previously been inferred for dco@xmath1 in the tw hya , hd 163296 , and dm tau disks @xcite , and ring - like emission patterns are observed for as 209 , v4046 sgr , mwc 480 , and hd 163296 in this work .",
    "these results suggest that ring - like dco@xmath1 distributions are common , and support a cold h@xmath7d@xmath1 formation scenario .",
    "the double dco@xmath1 rings observed in the i m lup disk deviate from this picture somewhat , but @xcite found that the presence of multiple rings could be explained with models of dco@xmath1 abundances first decreasing in the outer disk due to co freezeout , then rising again as co non - thermally desorbs in regions of the disk with lower surface density where uv radiation penetrates closer to the midplane .",
    "in addition , while the lkca 15 dco@xmath1 emission is not as distinctly ring - like as that of the other disks , the radially averaged integrated intensity of h@xmath2co@xmath1 drops by about a factor of 3 from 50 to 200 au , whereas the dco@xmath1 radial profile remains relatively flat in the same interval . likewise , the radially averaged integrated intensity of h@xmath2co@xmath1 in the hd 163296 disk drops by about a factor of 5 from 50 to 200 au , whereas that of dco@xmath1 drops only by about a factor of 2 .",
    "this behavior suggests that either the column densities or average excitation temperatures of h@xmath2co@xmath1 are decreasing more rapidly with radius than those of dco@xmath1 . since disks are expected to have radially decreasing temperature gradients , either scenario would require the dco@xmath1/hco@xmath1 ratio to increase at lower temperatures .",
    "we do not observe radially decreasing emission profiles for dco@xmath1 .",
    "in addition , given that the dominant formation pathway of dcn is expected to begin with ch@xmath7d@xmath1 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "our observations therefore do not provide evidence that the ch@xmath7d@xmath1 pathway dominates dco@xmath1 production .",
    "it is interesting to note , though , that the two herbig ae sources in the survey , mwc 480 and hd 163296 , have disk - averaged dco@xmath1/hco@xmath1 ratios comparable to those of the t tauri sources .",
    "this result may seem counter - intuitive , since the herbig ae disks are expected to be warmer and therefore less favorable toward high deuterium fractionation , although no deuterium chemistry models have been published for herbig ae disks yet . the observations may hint that ch@xmath7d@xmath1 is a secondary contributor to fractionation .",
    "in addition , based on dco@xmath1 @xmath157 observations in the hd 163296 disk , @xcite concluded that dco@xmath1 remains abundant in regions of the disk warmer than 30 k , which suggests that a warm pathway is partially responsible for dco@xmath1 production . a larger sample of both t tauri and herbig ae disks would be needed to determine whether they indeed typically have similar levels of dco@xmath1/hco@xmath1 fractionation .",
    "the v4046 sgr and lkca 15 disks both feature prominent cavities , but markedly different line emission patterns , implying that the presence of a cavity does not lead to predictable molecular distributions .",
    "the dcn and dco@xmath1 in the v4046 sgr disk are clearly not co - spatial , while they have more similar radial extents in the lkca 15 disk .",

[ fig : as209continuum ] ) appears to coincide with a similar outer ring in the c@xmath212o @xmath213 emission and with a sharp change in slope of the 1.4 mm continuum emission observed at slightly lower spatial resolution in @xcite .",

    "@xcite proposed that the outer c@xmath212o emission ring was the result of desorption in the outer disk outside the co snowline .",

    "all four are distributed in emission rings peaking near the dark ring in the 258 ghz dust continuum .",
    "given that h@xmath2cn and h@xmath2co@xmath1 do not have similar formation pathways , the similar emission patterns in the four molecules observed for as 209 may instead be related to the interplay between the dust and gas structures near the continuum emission gap .",
    "however , for as 209 , higher - resolution continuum studies at multiple wavelengths to constrain spectral indices and surface density profiles would be needed to distinguish between the numerous mechanisms for producing dust emission rings that have been proposed for protoplanetary disks .",
    "ring - like structures in millimeter dust continuum emission have also been directly imaged in several other protoplanetary disks , but their origins are still debated @xcite .",
    "in addition to the mechanisms discussed in the previous paragraph , other hypotheses for the origins of rings often invoke the presence of a forming planet ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) or magnetorotational instability ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .      because temperatures in a protoplanetary disk generally decrease with radius and increase with height above the midplane , co is present in the gas phase in the inner regions of the disk and in warm layers above the midplane , but it is mostly frozen out onto dust grains in the outer midplane .",
    "measuring the location of the co midplane snowline , which marks the radius where this freezeout starts to occur , is important for constraining planet formation theories because changes in the abundance of co gas and ice are thought to influence the composition of planetary atmospheres as well as the movement and growth of dust grains ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because co is almost always optically thick in protoplanetary disks , the co snowline is usually traced instead through interferometric imaging of optically thin molecules that have distributions dependent on gas - phase co @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that dco@xmath1 traces the co snowline because the formation of dco@xmath1 requires both h@xmath7d@xmath1 and gas - phase co , which coexist only in a narrow temperature range .",
    "n@xmath7h@xmath1 is also used as a tracer because it is quickly destroyed by gas - phase co , so it is expected to become abundant when co starts freezing out @xcite .",
    "although the dco@xmath1 emission morphologies and high fractionation levels observed in this work are broadly consistent with predictions from disk models invoking the standard h@xmath7d@xmath1 pathway , observations of the other molecular lines in this survey provide evidence that dco@xmath1 is not a robust tracer of the co snowline .",
    "@xcite make a similar argument based on the relationship between the inferred dco@xmath1 and n@xmath7h@xmath1 distributions , while our line of reasoning is based on the relationship between dco@xmath1 and h@xmath2co@xmath1 . whereas @xcite suggested that the inner radius of the dco@xmath1 distribution is determined by where h@xmath7d@xmath1 becomes abundant , the as 209",
    ", i m lup , lkca 15 , and mwc 480 disks feature central dips in their h@xmath2co@xmath1 radial emission profiles that are comparable to or even larger than the central dips in the corresponding dco@xmath1 profiles .",
    "the h@xmath2co@xmath1 dip in the lkca 15 disk can be plausibly explained by a drop in gas density , which has already been inferred for several transition disks based on co isotopologue observations @xcite , but no models or observations so far have indicated that a similar drop in central gas density is likely for the full disks .",
    "instead , the observations of as 209 , i m lup , and mwc 480 raise the possibility that the inner radius of the dco@xmath1 ring is not always controlled by the availability of h@xmath7d@xmath1 , but that instead , the inner edges of the dco@xmath1 and h@xmath2co@xmath1 rings may be set by common chemical or physical factors , such as the ionizing environment due to cosmic rays or x - rays ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "alternatively , high dust opacity at the disk center could create the appearance of a hole in the h@xmath2co@xmath1 distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but then optically thin dco@xmath1 emission would likely suffer similar effects , which would also increase the difficulty of using it to trace the co snowline . given that optically thin line transitions can now be imaged by alma with much greater ease than by previous instruments , the question of how dust opacity affects the interpretation of their emission patterns will warrant more rigorous examination through continuum and line observations in multiple bands ( e.g. , band 3 in conjunction with band 6 or 7 ) as well as simultaneous modeling of gas and dust structure .",
    "the dco@xmath1 observations in the i m lup and lkca 15 disks , as well as the h@xmath2co@xmath1 emission in the hd 163296 disk , also indicate that the outer edge of the dco@xmath1 emission profile does not necessarily correspond closely to the location of the classical midplane co snowline .",
    "@xcite proposed that the second dco@xmath1 emission ring in the i m lup disk arises from co ice desorption outside the co snowline , whereas the inner dco@xmath1 emission ring was likely located near the co snowline . at lower spatial resolutions , multiple dco@xmath1 emission rings could appear to be a single ring , for which neither the inner nor outer edge would mark the location of the co snowline .",
    "no estimates of co snowline locations are available in the literature for the lkca 15 disk , but estimates for other disks range from 17 to 90 au @xcite . rather than being confined to the single narrow ring predicted by disk chemistry models , the lkca 15 dco@xmath1 radial profile remains relatively flat out to hundreds of au , well past likely locations of the midplane co snowline .",
    "finally , the annular gap in h@xmath2co@xmath1 emission in the hd 163296 disk at @xmath3 200 au is well beyond the 90 au co snowline that @xcite estimated from n@xmath7h@xmath1 data , which could indicate that gas - phase co is depleted through some other mechanism besides co freezeout . using millimeter observations at @xmath214 , @xcite identified a number of rings in the hd 163296 disk where both the co and dust are depleted .",
    "while the most distant ring identified is at 160 au , which does not appear to be an obvious match with the h@xmath2co@xmath1 gap , our observations are also at coarser resolution , so forward modeling will be necessary to determine more precisely the nature of the relationship between the h@xmath2co@xmath1 and co distributions in this source .",
    "we present sensitive , high - resolution alma observations of dco@xmath1 , dcn , h@xmath2co@xmath1 , and h@xmath2cn @xmath31 lines , as well as hcn @xmath31 in the i m lup disk , that indicate that deuterium fractionation of these molecules is efficient in disks and manifests in diverse forms .",

    "these high values are comparable to previous disk observations and disk chemical models , as well as the d / h ratios measured for earlier stages of star formation .",
    "3 .   given the high rate of dcn detections ( four of which are new ) with relatively short integration times , dcn is especially valuable as a tracer of disk chemistry in the context of chemical evolution because it has also been observed in cold interstellar environments and within the solar system .",
    "4 .   the diverse emission morphologies observed for dcn suggest that both warm and cold pathways can contribute significantly to its production in disks .",
    "the observations point to a cold formation pathway dominating dco@xmath1 production in disks .",
    "however , even though dco@xmath1 has been proposed as a co snowline tracer on the basis of dco@xmath1 formation being most favored in gas near the co freezeout temperature , observations of similar central and annular gaps in h@xmath2co@xmath1 and dco@xmath1 emission suggest that the ring - like emission profiles of dco@xmath1 may not reliably constrain the location of the co snowline .",
