    "since the successful launch of the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope in 2008 june , we now have a new opportunity to study gamma - ray emission from different types of high energy sources with much improved sensitivity and localization capabilities than with the egret instrument onboard the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ ( cgro ) . with the field of view covering 20% of the sky at every moment ( five times larger than egret ) , and its improved sensitivity ( by more than an order of magnitude with respect to egret ) , the large area telescope ( lat ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) aboard _ fermi _ surveys the entire sky each day down to photon flux levels of @xmath0 @xmath1 few @xmath2 .",
    "the number of detected gamma - ray sources has increased , with the 2nd catalog ( 2fgl ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) containing 1873 gamma - ray sources in the 100 mev to 100 gev range , while 271 objects were previously listed in the 3rd egret catalog ( 3eg ; * ? ? ?",
    "more than 1,000 gamma - ray sources included in the 2fgl are proposed to be associated with active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and 87 sources with pulsars ( psrs ; * ? ? ? * ) , including 21 millisecond pulsars ( msps ) .",
    "other associations included supernova remnants ( snrs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , low - mass / high - mass x - ray binaries @xcite , pulsar wind nebulae @xcite , normal and starburst galaxies @xcite , and the giant lobes of a radio galaxy @xcite",
    ".    however , no obvious counterparts at longer wavelength have been found for as much as 31% of the 2fgl objects so that several hundreds of gev sources currently remain unassociated with any known astrophysical systems . in other words",
    "the nature of unassociated gamma - ray sources are still one of the major puzzles , and the mystery has never been solved yet . fortunately , an improved localization capabilities of the ( typical 95% confidence radii @xmath3 , and even 0@xmath4.005 - 0@xmath4.01 for the brightest sources ; @xcite ) , when compared to that of egret ( typical @xmath5 ) , enables more effective follow - up studies at radio , optical , and x - ray frequencies , which can help to unravel the nature of the unid gamma - ray emitters .",
    "indeed for example , a lot of _ fermi _ sources were identified using wise ir data @xcite .    in this context",
    ", we started a new project to investigate the nature of unid objects through x - ray follow - up observations with the xis sensor onboard the x - ray satellite ( see section 2 ) .",
    "for example , the results of the first - year campaign conducted in ao-4 ( 2009 ) were presented in @xcite . in this campaign , the x - ray counterpart for one of the brightest unassociated objects , 1fglj1231.1 - 1410 ( also detected by egret as 3egj1234 - 1318 and egrj1231 - 1412 ) , was discovered for the first time .",
    "the x - ray spectrum was well fitted by a blackbody with an additional power - law component , supporting the recent identification of this source with a msp . in the second - year campaign ( ao-5 ) ,",
    "another seven unid sources were subsequently observed with @xcite . in particular , this paper presented a convenient method to classify the objects into `` agn - like '' and `` psr - like '' by comparing their multiwavelength properties with those of known agns and pulsars . in the third - year ( ao-6 ) , 1fglj2339.7 - 0531 ( yatsu et al .",
    "2013 in prep ; also romani & shaw 2011 ) and 1fglj1311.7 - 3429 @xcite were intensively monitored with a total exposure time of 200 ksec .",
    "both sources are now suggested to be `` black widow '' msp systems and newly categorized as `` radio - quiet '' msps . as these projects show , the x - ray follow - up observations especially using provided various fruitful results to clarify the nature of unassociated gamma - ray sources , and was able to find a new type of gamma - ray emitter .    to complete a series of x - ray follow - up programs described above",
    ", we further carried out the analysis of all the archival x - ray data of 134 unid gamma - ray sources in the 1fgl catalog of point sources ( 1fgl ; * ? ? ?",
    "_ swift_/xrt .",
    "note that , all these 134 sources have been detected in the 2fgl catalog , hence the updated data on there lat position and spectra were available from the 2nd @xmath6/lat catalog so are used throughout this work .",
    "this allowed us to construct the seds ( seds ) of each objects from radio to gamma - rays ( see section2 and appendix ) for the first time .",
    "note that we target all the 1fgl unid sources that satisfy our selections ( see section2 ) , using updated / improved information from the 2fgl catalog on their lat positions and spectra in this paper .",
    "moreover , three sources that displayed potentially interesting seds , 1fglj0022.2 - 1850 ( or 2fgl j0022.2 - 1853 ) , 1fglj0038.0 + 1236 ( or 2fgl j0037.8 + 1238 ) and 1fglj0157.0 - 5259 ( or 2fgl j0157.2 - 5259 ) , were deeply observed with as a part of ao7 campaign in 2012 . in the 2fgl catalog , both 1fglj0022.2 - 1850 and 1fglj0157.0 - 5259",
    "are categorized as active galaxies of uncertain type ( agu ) , while 1fglj0038.0 + 1236 was classified as a bl lac type of blazar ( bzb ) based on the positional coincidences to sources observed at another wavelength .",
    "but as we see below , the unique seds of these three objects are not well understood as conventional blazars . in section2",
    "we first describe the analysis of the 134 1fgl unid sources with _ swift_. subsequently in section3 , deep follow - up observations of the selected three sources , 1fglj0022.2 - 1850 , 1fglj0038.0 + 1236 and 1fglj0157.0 - 5259 are shown .",
    "the results of the analysis are given in section4 .",
    "the discussion and summary are presented in section5 and 6 , respectively .",
    "@xcite is a gamma - ray observatory launched on 2004 november 20 .",
    "the primary goal of this mission is to explore and follow - up the gamma - ray burst , but high mobility and sensitivity to localize sources especially using the xrt @xcite and uvot @xcite , makes it also viable to follow - up unid gamma - ray objects discovered by .",
    "in fact , _ swift _ follow - up observations helped study many unid sources @xcite .",
    "here we tried to perform a systematic and uniform analysis of unid gamma - ray sources observed thus far with _",
    "swift _ using the archival data .",
    "the selection criteria is given as follows ; ( 1 ) categorized as unid sources in 1fgl catalog , ( 2 ) localized at high galactic latitude @xmath7 @xmath8 10@xmath9 , ( 3 ) observational data are in public at the time of october 2011 , ( 4 ) the positional center of _ swift _ field - of - view is within 12 arcmin from the 1fgl sources . among 630 unid sources listed in the 1fgl catalog ,",
    "this selection yields 134 sources which we analyzed here . in the reduction and the analysis of the _ swift_/xrt and uvot data , headas software version 6.11 and",
    "the most recent calibration databases ( caldb ) as of 2011 october 20 were used .",
    "we did not use bat data because most sources are not bright enough to be detected within short exposure of typically 10 ksec or less . in the xrt analysis",
    ", we only use the pc mode data , while only image data taken from photometry observation is used in the uvot analysis .",
    "two types of xrt archival data can be obtained from the _ swift _ data center , level 1 and 2 .",
    "level 2 cleaned data have gone through the standard pipeline process ; however , we calibrated the level 1 data ourselves in a way recommended by _",
    "swift _ team . particularly , we selected the good time interval ( gti ) from the level 1 data using ` xrtpipeline ` .",
    "in this process , we only changed the default ` xrtpipeline ` selection in the temperature of ccds from `` @xmath10 '' to `` @xmath11 '' , where the former is the default value . in the xrt image analysis",
    ", we tried to detect the x - ray counterparts of 1fgl unid sources , and localize each source .",
    "first , we extracted x - ray images in the energy range of @xmath12 kev using ` xselect ` .",
    "next by using ` ximage ` , we searched for `` possible '' x - ray sources which were @xmath8 3 @xmath13 confidence level in photon statistics against background . the position of these sources are determined with a typical accuracy of @xmath14 using ` xrtcentroid ` .",
    "the results of x - ray source detection is listed in table 6 ( see , appendix ) . in the appendix",
    ", we also show the xrt images corresponding to each of the 134 1fgl unid gamma - ray sources indicating also the 2fgl error ellipses ( figure11 ) . in these images , bright radio sources and x - ray sources listed in the rosat all - sky survey bright source catalogue ( 1rxs ;",
    "* ) corresponding to the xrt sources are also plotted as magenta crosses . finally , if the x - ray sources were detected were within the 2fgl 95@xmath15 position error ellipse , we performed x - ray spectral analysis for those sources .",
    "we note that very bright x - ray sources with more than 0.6 c / s should cause serious pile - up effects in the xrt ccd , however , there were no such bright sources in our analyzed sample .    in the xrt spectral analysis ,",
    "pha files were extracted from event files with ` xselect ` and exposure maps were made using ` xrtexpomap ` .",
    "we made auxiliary response files ( arfs ) using ` xrtmkarf ` , while we used the current redistribution matrix files ( rmfs ) in caldb .",
    "we extracted photons from circles with 30 arcsec radii around the source positions as the source regions , and we set the concentric rings centered at the source positions with radius 30 - 180 arcsec as the background regions . in the case when some background sources appear in the field , or overall regions",
    "can not be fitted in the ccd , we simply remove the region surrounding these background sources , or the region outside the ccd chip . if there is no source detected above @xmath16 inside the 2fgl error ellipse , we derived the upper limit assuming the 2fgl error ellipses as the source region of corresponding x - ray flux .",
    "the results of spectral analysis are included in the seds given in the appendix .",
    "we note that x - ray spectral data were binned at two different ways according to the source brightness ; ( a)binned with ` grppha ` so that at least 20 photons are included in each bin , ( b)divide x - ray spectral data ( 0.5 - 10.0 kev ) logarithmically into 5 bin .",
    "when the source have more than 40 counts , we used ( a ) , but otherwise we used ( b ) .",
    "we performed the analysis of uvot data only when the x - ray counterpart of 1fgl source was found in the _ swift_/xrt field of view .",

    "when each filter included more than one observation , the images and exposure maps were summed using ` uvotimsum ` . using ` uvotdetect `",
    ", we detected the sources which have high signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "we set the circles around those sources with radius  5 arcsec as the sources regions if any source was found in the 90% error ellipse of the _ swift_/xrt source .",
    "then , circles with radius 30  as the background regions were taken from the area where no sources are found .",
    "finally , we obtained the magnitude of each filter using ` uvotsource ` .",
    "the correction of galactic extinction were performed following the way described in cardelli et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .      to construct seds of each 1fgl sources , we used not only the _ swift_/xrt and _ swift_/uvot flux data analyzed in this paper , but gamma - ray fluxes listed in the 2fgl catalog , and radio fluxes mostly from the ned database and w3browse based on a variety of catalogs .",
    "we searched for radio counterparts associated with the xrt or uvot objects which were mentioned above in the heasarc / master radio catalog , ( includes the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; * ? ? ? * ghz ) , the first survey catalog of 1.4-ghz radio sources ( first ; * ? ? ?",

    "note that if no corresponding radio sources were found in the 2fgl 95% error ellipses , we obtained the upper limit from the most bright radio source in the error ellipse .",
    "likewise , if no source was found in the error ellipse but some sources were found outside of the region , we used the sensitivity limits of those sources as an upper limit . finally resultant seds and flux values of each wavelength are given in the appendix ( figure 12 , table 5 and 6 ) .",
    "we observed three objects that exhibited potentially interesting or anomalous seds ( which is difficult to be explained by standard emission models of blazars , i.e. , ssc or external compton models as explained in @xcite ) with the x - ray astronomy satellite @xcite .",
