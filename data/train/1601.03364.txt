    "titan , saturn s largest moon , is swathed in a thick atmosphere with haze that is highly scattering and gas that absorbs at visible wavelengths .",
    "several wavelengths of light in the near infrared penetrate the atmosphere to reach the surface , however , with varying degrees of interference from the atmosphere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since _ cassini",
    "_ s arrival at the saturnian system in 2004 , the visual and infrared mapping spectrometer ( vims ) has been observing titan s surface at these seven spectral windows where methane gas absorption is weakest in the ir .",
    "the visible channels can be also be used to look at the surface , but to a more limited extent @xcite .",
    "+ even through these windows , however , observing the surface is complicated by the properties of titan s atmosphere .",
    "the haze particles of are highly forward scattering .",
    "this effect is seen across the ir - spectrum , increasing the reflectance of both windows and methane - saturated bands , and is stronger at the shorter wavelengths than at longer ones .",
    "analyses of solar occultations @xcite and specular reflections @xcite have measured the decreasing total optical depth ( both haze and gas opacities ) as a function of increasing wavelength .",
    "the haze distribution changes with latitude ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , altitude ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and season ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "scattering properties of the haze particles change with altitude and wavelength . despite this wealth of new insight into titan s atmosphere in the _ cassini _ era ,",
    "the details of the atmosphere s effects on emergent spectra are still far from understood .",
    "+ thus , as vims ir data only sample seven parts of titan s surface spectrum , it is difficult to identify which specific chemical species are present to create the observed signal . and",
    "yet , there are three cases where this has been done .",
    "@xcite identified a feature in titan s global spectrum at 5.05 @xmath0 m , which the authors suggest is indicative of benzene .",
    "@xcite identified ethane in the vims data from ontario lacus .",
    "+ @xcite identified an absorption feature in the spectrum of tui regio at 4.92 @xmath0 m using some of the earliest vims data .",
    "their method used deviance from the scene average as the criteria for absorption .",
    "co@xmath1 ice was originally proposed as a candidate material , as it demonstrates an absorption feature near 4.92 @xmath0 m .",
    "@xcite , however , point out that the wavelength shift necessary to match co@xmath1 ice to the 4.92 @xmath0 m feature is unphysical and the expected co@xmath1 feature in the 2.7 @xmath0 m region is not observed .",
    "@xcite also list several species from their laboratory survey with spectral features near 4.92 , including a predominately potassium ferricyanide mixture , acrylonitrile , and cyanonaphthalene .",
    "however , as we can not yet even specify exactly _ where _ this 4.92 @xmath0 m absorption occurs , let alone consider other coincident spectral features , the specific attribution of a chemical species to the 4.92 @xmath0 m absorption has not yet been made .",
    "+ generally , however , vims data are used to classify surface material into spectral units , groups of material that share overall spectral characteristics .",
    "spectral units define the unique characteristics of the  dark brown \" dunes ,  dark blue \" terrains including mountains @xcite , and the mountainous , channel - ridden xanadu region @xcite .",
    "+ titan s lakes and seas are also spectrally distinct : in the near infrared , they are darker than their surroundings at all wavelengths @xcite .",
    "these liquid bodies seem to be restricted to the polar regions , though see @xcite and @xcite . at the north pole ,",
    "the lakes and seas are of a variety of shapes and sizes : from kraken mare , the largest sea covering 400,000 km@xmath2 @xcite , to the lake district , a region of  cookie - cutter lakes\"@xcite which are just resolvable in vims data . the south pole , however , looks quite different .",
    "the south has just one substantial body of liquid , ontario lacus , which is about 15,000 km@xmath2 in size @xcite .",
    "+ thermodynamic models and laboratory experiments that explore the possible bulk composition of the lakes , as well as observations with the radar instrument that constrain some of the liquid s properties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "besides the ethane detection of @xcite , vims data is difficult to use to confirm the bulk composition of the liquid as the methane in the atmosphere obfuscates detection of liquid methane on the surface and vims can only sample a depth of a few microns . the ethane absorption in ontario",
    "lacus s spectrum is not sensitive to abundance .",
    "no other absorption features have been observed in vims lake spectra .",
    "+ some of the lakes and seas on titan have evaporite along their shorelines , as do some dry lakebeds @xcite .",
    "evaporite is solid material redeposited on the surface after the liquid in which it was dissolved evaporates . on titan",
    ", these deposits demonstrate a unique spectral behavior such that they are referred to as the 5-@xmath0m - bright spectral unit ",
    "so named because it is significantly brighter than any other surface units in the eponymous window . at 2.8 @xmath0 m",
    ", this material is relatively brighter than other surface units , but at shorter wavelengths , 5-@xmath0m - bright material is similar in reflectivity to other bright units like xanadu or the equatorial bright unit @xcite .",
    "+ the first evaporitic deposits were identified just south of ligeia mare where radar identified small ( 10 - 200 km in diameter ) lakes @xcite and dry lake beds @xcite . the same region also has lakes and dry lake beds without the 5-@xmath0m - bright signature : evidence that the bright deposits are evaporite , the material left over when liquid ( presumably methane or ethane ) evaporates .",
    "evaporite only forms once the liquid is saturated with solute ( on titan , probably some kind of hydrocarbon ) and if evaporation is the dominant mechanism for removing the liquid .",
    "an evaporitic deposit therefore indicates a location where liquid has ponded on the surface at some point in the past .",
    "+ @xcite conducted a survey of then - available vims data to locate all deposits of this 5-@xmath0m - bright material on titan s surface .",
    "the authors found that while more separate instances of evaporite deposits appear at the north pole , where the majority of titan s surface liquid is now located , the largest single deposits by surface area are located in titan s presently desert equatorial region at tui , the and hotei regio .",
    "@xcite interpreted lacustrine and fluvially carved features in the radar coverage of these two basins as indicative of tui and hotei being paleo seas . observing the 4.92 @xmath0 m absorption feature in the spectra of the north polar evaporites would be further evidence for this hypothesis as it would compositionally link the basins tui and hotei with the clearly lacustrine - associated deposits south of ligeia .",
    "+ in this work , we determine the degree of similarity between the compositions of the 5-@xmath0m - bright material at different latitudes by documenting all observations of the 4.92 @xmath0 m absorption in spectra of tui regio , hotei regio , and the evaporite candidates of @xcite .",
    "we compare the relative depths of the absorption feature with time and flyby geometries in an effort to distinguish what controls the absorption depth . in section [ observations ] , we describe the vims data and in section [ methods ] we describe the principal component analysis ( pca ) technique that we use to analyze them .",
    "section [ results ] presents our results for each 5-@xmath0m - bright deposit .",
    "we discuss our findings in section [ discussion ] and conclude with a summary of our work and its implications .",
    "we use data from the visual infrared and mapping spectrometer on - board _",
    "cassini _ from 2004 - 2014 .",
    "these were processed with the vims pipeline described in @xcite which converts the raw data into i / f , the observed reflectance divided by the incident solar flux .",
    "all geometric projections are done with software developed for @xcite . in table",
    "[ tab::obs ] we summarize the geometries and average resolutions of the data from each flyby .",
    "tui and hotei regiones were imaged during 2004 - 2009 , but the north pole evaporites were not fully visible until 2013 - 2015 .",
    "the viewing geometries between equatorial and polar deposits are therefore unavoidably different .",
    "in fact , the spread of viewing geometries over just the tui and hotei observations differ enough as to make comparison of uncorrected i / f between flybys difficult .",
    "we describe how we address this problem in section [ methods ] . +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     when plotted as a function of viewing geometry ( figure [ fig : eqwidthvangle ] ) , we do not observe any obvious trend to explain why the absorption feature is different from the time - independent average in some flybys and not others . comparing each viewing angle with equivalent width via a kendall tau test reveals no correlation .",
    "( with coefficients @xmath3 0.1 for each , we can not reject the null hypothesis . ) for example , the two flybys during which the equivalent width for tui regio is significantly above the average , ta and t46 , are both near specular , but otherwise not similar in geometry .",
    "ta is low phase with medium incidence and emission while t46 is high phase with medium incidence and emission .",
    "furthermore , the flyby during which tui s equivalent width is significantly below the average , t14 , has almost identical viewing geometry to t46 .",
    "hotei s significant cases , ta and t51 below the average and t4 and t9 above , are also near specular .",
    "but , as with tui regio , t51 and t4 are high phase while ta and t9 are low phase . therefore , our results do not support that any one value of phase , incidence , emission either independently or cumulatively is responsible for controlling equivalent width .",
    "we discuss possible explanations for this behavior and future analyses in section [ discussion ] .",
    "+          we plot equivalent width as a function of flyby for evaporites in figure [ fig : evapeqwidth ] with the same shape scheme as we used in figure [ fig : depths ] . as it is difficult to see the most northern features in the cylindrical projection of figure [ fig : global ] , we show in figure [ fig : nportho ] a labeled orthographic projection of the best vims data ( t93-t97 ) of titan s north pole in the same color scheme as figure [ fig : global ] .",
    "the inset of figure [ fig : nportho ] shows the equivalent width - to - noise calculation of figure [ fig : tuieqwidthimages ] for woytchugga lacuna and mackay lacus .",
    "( there are enough data from t96-t98 of similar viewing geometry for these two features to construct images of the necessary snr per pixel . ) woytchugga , whose positive equivalent widths at 4.92 @xmath0 m stand out above the noise level as an absorption feature , appears white in the inset .",
    "the region surrounding mackay lacus , which is also 5-@xmath0m - bright , also shows an absorption feature when coadding pixels from across the feature , but individually , no one pixel is above the noise level .",
    "thus , it is indistinguishable in the inset . + it is less useful to conduct the linear regression analysis described above for tui and hotei with these evaporite cases , as most do not have overlapping error bars and have only a handful of observations .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that the spread between values derived from different basis vectors is much smaller for the evaporites than for tui , hotei , and xanadu .",
    "the evaporites with the largest spread are those with the largest surface area woytchugga , flensborg sinus , and south of kraken .",
    "thus , we interpret that another source of unaccounted error is the spectral blending unavoidable at km / pixel resolution .",
    "for example , in the higher resolution data of hotei in t48 and t49 , @xcite identify patches of dark blue spectral units .",
    "the polygons used to define the extent of hotei for our pixel selection was drawn on these higher resolution maps , but this can not fix coarser resolution data . + according to the calculated equivalent widths shown in figure [ fig : evapeqwidth ] , we can group our results into three groups : evaporites that show the absorption feature in all observations , in most observations , and in at most one observation .",
    "there are eight evaporite deposits that demonstrate the absorption feature in every observation : deposits located in west fensal ( 4 flybys ) ; ontario lacus s shoreline deposits ( 2 ) ; kraken mare s flensborg",
    "sinus and gabes sinus ( both only observed once ) ; djerid lacuna ( 1 ) ; atitlan lacus ( 1 ) ; uvs lacus ( 1 ) ; and mackay lacus ( 5 ) .",
    "+ in all but one of observation , woytchugga lacuna ( 7/8 flybys ) and walvis sinus ( 5/6 ) demonstrate the 4.92 @xmath0 m absorption feature , while kumbaru sinus ( 4/6 ) shows it in all but two observations .",
    "the 5-@xmath0m - bright deposit at the north end of yalaing terra and the deposits south of kraken mare both demonstrate absorption features at 4.92 @xmath0 m in two out of the four observations of each feature . whether these differences between flyby are due to viewing geometry , surface roughness , evaporite composition , etc",
    ". can not be addressed by the methods used here and is thus beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "it is instead further evidence for the complexity of the problem evident in the results for tui and hotei .",
    "there are also evaporites that do not exhibit the absorption feature in a majority of their observations : muggel lacus , vanern lacus , ligeia mare shoreline deposits , and atacama lacuna .",
    "not all 5-@xmath0m - bright terrains demonstrate the absorption feature at 4.92 @xmath0 m , nor do those that do show the absorption show it in all observations .",
    "our results can not detail what physical characteristics set this behavior ( i.e. relative abundances , micro - scale surface structure , etc . ) .",
    "to do so , more rigorous modeling of each feature s phase function will require a full radiative transfer correction for the atmosphere , our next project .",
    "however , our data , if true , do illuminate bulk spectral behavior , which we discuss below : what factors probably play in our results for tui , why hotei is different , and the heterogeneity of evaporite deposits .",
    "+      the equivalent widths of the 4.92 @xmath0 m absorption feature in the spectra of tui regio are probably a function of viewing geometry , exposure time , the vims pipeline flat - field calibration , particle size , scattering properties of the grains of absorbent material , as well as the optical properties of surrounding materials .",
    "generally , mid incidence angle observations yield a  stronger \" absorption for tui regio , though if our estimated errors are robust , there is little difference between the extent of the absorption feature between flybys .",
    "+ titan evaporites could be crystalline like earth evaporites as the end result of their similar formation process ; such a structure would help explain why the 5-@xmath0m - bright material is bright at all wavelengths .",
    "as such , evaporites could have a preferred viewing geometry at which the absorption feature could appear stronger due to increased internal scattering before the light refracts out of the crystal and returns to the detector .",
    "such an effect would be complicated by surrounding material and different particle sizes .",
    "+      the equivalent widths of the 4.92 @xmath0 m absorption at hotei regio are generally smaller than those at tui for the same flyby .",
    "interestingly , hotei does not show the same angular dependence as tui : hotei s absorption features are wider at smaller incidence and larger emission angles .",
    "however , the averages for both features in the flyby analysis are close enough to be within the estimated error of the fit , what we might expect if these features contain the same material responsible for the 4.92 @xmath0 m absorption",
    ". + if the material responsible for this absorption is present at both tui and hotei , why might it demonstrate different spectral behavior in flybys where we observe both features ?",
    "our analysis of the influence of viewing geometry is not sufficient to explain this behavior there must be other driving factors .",
    "for example , it has been shown by @xcite that absorption depths for regolith - like surface material are strongly dependent on particle size ; larger particles yielded a stronger absorption for the lunar soils of that study .",
    "thus , it could be that the 4.92 @xmath0 m absorbing grains are of different sizes at tui regio and hotei regio . or , if hotei s 4.92 @xmath0 m absorbent material is covered by , say , larger grains not present or not of the same size than at tui , the depth of the absorption feature might be dampened in different viewing geometries ( i.e. flybys ) for the different basins .",
    "work by @xcite demonstrated that the overall phase curve behavior is largely controlled by the brightest , most abundant , and least isotropically scattering particles in a material . of course it also could be that the albedo subtraction does nt work as seamlessly as we have assumed , but",
    "the results for the evaporite cases demonstrate that material variability is not an unreasonable explanation .",
    "+      what distinguishes evaporite deposits that do show the 4.92 @xmath0 m absorption feature from those that do nt ? there is no simple , common geomorphological characteristic .",
    "woytchugga lacuna is a large ( 66,700 km@xmath2 ) , completely dry lakebed .",
    "ontario lacus is a lake with exposed evaporite along its eastern shorelines .",
    "mackay lacus is a partially - filled lake at @xmath4 75@xmath5 n. vanern lacus is a 400 km@xmath2 partially - filled lake south of ligeia mare with a bathtub ring of evaporite and djerid lacuna is a nearby dry lakebed of similar size . yet all of these features demonstrate an absorption at 4.92 @xmath0 m in most of their observations .",
    "+ recent work by @xcite shows that for solutions with several solutes ( each of different solubility in a titan liquid ) , the evaporites will precipitate out in layers based on their solubilities ; compounds with the largest solubilities will stay in solution the longest . in figure [ uaeevap ]",
    "we show an example of this process on earth in a wet interdune in liwa , uae ( top photo ) .",
    "the inset shows thin sheets of gypsum evaporites along the edges of the receding shoreline while cubed halite is at the bottom of the liquid .",
    "this separation is due to the respective solubilities of the two compounds as well as the saturation of the solution . + * thus , it could be that * each of these evaporite locations that do show the absorption are far enough along in the drying - out stage to have precipitated out the more soluble 4.92 @xmath0 m absorbent material .",
    "djerid and woytchugga are at the end point of drying out ( i.e. there is not enough liquid left to be detectable by vims).while , based on comparing the areas of liquid - covered surface and evaporite covered surface , vanern and ontario have receded by 90% and 15% their original areas , respectively .",
    "if our results are indicating that the evaporite deposits demonstrating the 4.92 @xmath0 m absorption feature have reached some endpoint where the most soluble material has precipitated out , then the work of @xcite would point to butane and acetylene as candidates for the material responsible for the 4.92 @xmath0 m absorption .",
    "+        of course it could also be that the non - absorption cases ( muggel lacus , ligeia mare shorelines , and atacama lacuna ) have a different solution composition . at 83@xmath5",
    "n , muggel is nearer to the north pole than the other deposits considered here .",
    "@xcite discuss how more frequent rains at the northern - most parts of the pole might be responsible for a  salinity \" dichotomy between the more northern ligeia mare and more southern kraken mare .",
    "perhaps , then , muggel and mackay only precipitate out the least soluble sediments ( and thus those that do not exhibit the 4.92 @xmath0 m absorption ) , as before the 4.92-@xmath0m - absorbent material falls out of solution , a new influx of methane halts evaporite formation . or it could be that the ligeia watershed washes different sediments or even different amounts of sediments into the sea than kraken s .",
    "+ as for the less straightforward evaporite deposits that behave more like hotei ( walvis sinus , kumbaru sinus , flensborg sinus , south of kraken deposits , yalaing , and deposits located in west fensal ) , it is again difficult to pull out viewing geometry dependence of extent of absorption feature depth without more rigorous modeling . indeed , there are some inconsistencies in the cases we consider as demonstrating the absorption feature , like woytchugga lacuna which does not show an appreciable equivalent width in the most recent observations ( t104 ) .",
    "while we attribute these ambiguities to deficiencies in our current method , we can not exclusively rule out the possibility that the 4.92 @xmath0 m absorption in the studied evaporites might be lost in noise or highly variable due to dynamic surface processes .",
    "+ for example , as documented by @xcite , there are vims observations of north yalaing before , during , and after a wetting event . during t61-t67",
    ", yalaing appears 5-@xmath0m - bright , but does not consistently show the absorption feature ( note the disagreement between the different eigenvector samples in t67 ) . in vims data from t76 , during the wetting event , yalaing terra appears brighter at 2 @xmath0 m , is no longer 5-@xmath0m - bright , and exhibits the absorption . with a thin enough layer",
    ", vims could still be sampling surface material beneath the 2-@xmath0m - bright covering . then , after the wetting event ( t82 ) the deposit returns to the 5-@xmath0m - bright spectral unit and , in our results , shows the absorption feature , though to a lesser extent than that observed in t76 . @xcite",
    "propose that the spectral change was probably due to the presence of a transient layer : either volatile frost that sublimes away or a deposition of fine - grained particles that blow away to reveal the original material underneath .",
    "sintering driven by the first scenario could create larger grain sizes that might thus explain the increased absorption feature at flybys during and after the wetting event . or",
    ", it could be that this wetting event instigated a removal process of some surrounding material that promoted detection of the 4.92 @xmath0 m feature .",
    "+ other evaporite candidates exhibit different values for equivalent width depending on flyby . while it is not clear that our analysis has removed all sources of systematic error , it is also a possibility that these other cases have experienced some change similar to that observed at yalaing terra .",
    "unfortunately , there is no evidence in the iss or vims cloud coverage maps to support such an explanation for the dramatic changes in equivalent width for fensal @xcite .",
    "clouds have frequently been observed at the higher latitudes where the north polar evaporites are , but vims data provides no benchmarks for what the surface looked like beforehand .",
    "surprisingly , there has been a relatively few clouds at the north pole in our latest observations , despite global circulation model predictions of a pick up in seasonal weather activity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , there are no observed weather events able to explain , for example , the change between vanern observed in t93 and t100 .",
    "+ evaporites probably form on larger timescales than the lifetime of the cassini mission , however .",
    "thus , it is useful to also consider the results of general circulation models , which , for titan , largely predict greater rainfall at the poles and a relative dearth at the equator @xcite .",
    "that is not to say that it is impossible for rain to occur there as demonstrated by the vims observations detailed above by @xcite and iss observations @xcite .",
    "some gcm results suggest that perhaps this is nt as much of a problem for the evaporites found away from titan s poles as previously thought .",
    "for example , in the model of @xcite , pockets of equatorial and midlatitudes experienced surface liquid and drying periods ( the conditions necessary for evaporite formation ) .",
    "this model s initial conditions included a 4 m deep methane reservoir with deeper , localized areas to represent the seas and ontario lacus .",
    "interestingly , the evolution of such a titan results in areas of surface liquid change in locations where we observe evaporites ( namely , at woytchugga lacuna , tui regio , hotei regio , and fensal ; see figure 14 of @xcite ) .",
    "+      we report the observation of the same 4.92 @xmath0 m absorption described by @xcite in the spectrum of tui regio in later observations of that surface feature , as well as in some observations of hotei regio , another equatorial basin covered in 5-@xmath0m - bright material . though we explore the dependence of this absorption feature on viewing geometry , we find that the phase function will require full radiative transfer treatment to solve completely .",
    "we also look for the 4.92 @xmath0 m absorption in the spectra of several evaporites identified by @xcite and find that while some do , not all evaporites have the spectral feature . we propose that this variance could be due to differences in solution composition , different states of drying , or different surface roughnesses .",
    "our analysis is not able to definitively discern between which of these possibilities could best explain the variable behavior of the 4.92 @xmath0 m absorption feature .",

    "<S> we document the similarities in composition between the equatorial basins tui regio , hotei regio , and other 5-@xmath0m - bright materials , notably the north polar evaporites , by investigating the presence and extent of an absorption feature at 4.92 @xmath0 m . in most observations , woytchugga lacuna , ontario lacus , mackay lacus , deposits near fensal , some of the lakes and dry lake beds south of ligeia , and the southern shores of kraken mare share the absorption feature at 4.92 @xmath0 m observed in the spectra of tui and hotei . </S>",
    "<S> besides woytchugga and at fensal , these 5-@xmath0m - bright deposits are geomorphologically - substantiated evaporites . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the similarity in composition strengthens the hypothesis that tui and hotei once contained liquid . </S>",
    "<S> other evaporite deposits , however , do not show the 4.92 @xmath0 m absorption , notably muggel lacus and the shores of ligeia mare at the north pole . </S>",
    "<S> this difference in composition suggests that there are more than one kind of soluble material in titan s lakes that can create evaporite and/or that the surface properties at the vims wavelength scale are not uniform between the different deposits ( crystal size , abundance , etc ) . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that the surface structure , composition , and formation history of titan s evaporites may be at least as dynamic and complex as their earth counterparts . </S>"
