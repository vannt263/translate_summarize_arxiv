    "recent studies of distant galaxies have established that the fraction of s0s in rich galaxy clusters drops by a factor 23 from the local universe to @xmath9 , while the fraction of spiral galaxies increases comparatively ( couch et al .",
    "1994 ; dressler et al . 1997 ; van dokkum et al . 1998 ; fasano et al .",
    "parallel studies have found a number of poststarburst galaxies within clusters ( dressler & gunn 1983 ; couch & sharples 1987 ) , a suppressed star formation rate for spiral types relative to the field ( balogh et al .",
    "1998 ) , and evidence of an infalling spiral population out to @xmath10 ( poggianti et al . 1999 ; kodama & bower 2001 ) .",
    "this naturally leads to the scenario that cluster s0s could form from spiral galaxies through interaction with the cluster environment ( jones , smail & couch 2000 ; kodama & smail 2001 ) .",
    "three mechanisms have been suggested for the transformation : galaxy - galaxy interactions , tidal forces , and gas stripping .",
    "galaxy - galaxy interaction is most efficient in group environments , where relative velocities are low ( zabludoff & mulchaey 1998 ; mulchaey & zabludoff 1998 ; ghigna et al .",
    "1998 ) , while tidal forces ( toomre & toomre 1972 ; moore et al . 1996",
    "; mihos , mcgaugh , & de blok 1997 ) are effective on small spirals .",
    "gas stripping is expected to be an effective process in rich clusters ( abadi , moore , & bower 1999 ; quilis , moore , & bower 2000 ; bekki , couch , & shioya 2002 ; vogt et al .",
    "although each mechanism is efficient in different circumstances and/or environments , many of the numerical studies of these mechanisms predict a star - burst could / should happen during the processes leading to the cessation of star formation required by the spiral - to - s0 transformation .",
    "until recently , however , there has been no compelling evidence indicating that spiral galaxies falling into dense environments experience a star - burst .",
    "motivated by this ziegler et al .",
    "( 2003 ) investigated three clusters at @xmath11@xmath12 and used the tully - fisher relation ( tfr ) to compare galaxy luminosities of field and cluster spirals at the same mass , finding no measurable difference .",
    "in contrast , milvang - jensen et al . ( 2003 ) carried out a similar study for the rich cluster ms1054.4@xmath130321 at @xmath14 , and found evidence for some brightening in the cluster galaxies relative to the field ones at the same rotation velocity , implying more active star - formation of spiral galaxies in clusters .",
    "the situation is thus controversial , but these studies showed that using the tfr as a tool for comparing field and cluster galaxies at intermediate redshift could be successful .",
    "following milvang - jensen et al .",
    ", we have carried out a study of the tfr in nine additional distant rich clusters .",
    "five have been observed with the vlt using the fors2 multi - slit spectrograph ( seifert et al .",
    "2000 ) and the results ( including a re - analysis of the ms1054.4@xmath130321 data ) have been reported in bamford et al .",
    "( 2005a , b05a hereafter ) , where they have found further evidence for the brightening in the cluster spirals . in this paper , we report on our tfr study for the remaining four clusters observed with the subaru telescope using the focas spectrograph ( kashikawa et al . 2002 ) .",
    "since our sample includes field galaxies , we also discuss their evolution following bamford , aragn - salamanca & milvang - jensen ( 2005b , b05b hereafter ) .    before comparing the cluster spiral galaxies with the field ones",
    ", one needs to be aware that the comparison could be complicated by strong selection effects .",
    "for example , the probability of observing a galaxy in a star - burst phase will be lower if the star - formation occurs over a short time - scale ; on the other hand , a star - bursting galaxy will be brighter , and thus more likely to appear in a magnitude limited sample .",
    "similarly , one could think that if our sample contains galaxies in the fading phase after the starburst has ended , the average luminosity of our sample would be lowered , perhaps cancelling the effect of the initial brightening .",
    "however , it is unlikely that we will be able to measure rotation curves for galaxies after the cessation of star formation since emission lines would be absent .",
    "all these effects will probably affect the average properties of the galaxies in our field and cluster samples , so we have carried out careful modeling for the correct interpretation of the observations .    throughout the paper , we assume @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17=70 km s@xmath18mpc@xmath19 .",
    "all magnitudes are in the vega zero - point system .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,>,^,>,>,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ t_sim ]      the evolution of the @xmath1-band absolute magnitude with redshift for the field spirals in our sample ( eq . ( [ e_zev ] ) and fig .  [ f_zev ] ) can be interpreted as due to the evolution of the star - formation rate ( sfr ) of these galaxies . in this section ,",
    "we parameterise the sfr evolution as a simple power law of the form @xmath20 , and estimate the value of @xmath8 that best explains our result . in order to calculate the luminosity evolution in the @xmath1-band associated with the postulated sfr evolution we used bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) models with a chabrier ( 2003 ) initial mass function and solar metallicity .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ f_sfr_zev ] . changing the formation epoch of the galaxies in the range @xmath21",
    "hardly affects our estimated @xmath8 for @xmath22 .",
    "thus , we arbitrarily set the time at which spirals start forming stars at 20% of the universe s present - day age ( @xmath23 with the adopted ` concordance ' cosmology ) .",
    "note that if the sfr had remained constant with time ( @xmath24 ) , spiral galaxies would get slightly fainter with redshift in the @xmath1 band as the building up of their stellar populations with time slightly overcompensates the average ageing of their stellar populations .",
    "since our observations indicate that spiral galaxies get brighter with redshift , their sfr must be higher at higher  @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath26 .    to compare our observational results with the model predictions , and to increase the statistic accuracy , we compute the weighted - mean of the slopes in eq .",
    "( [ e_zev ] ) and in b05b ( @xmath27 ) , and interpret it as the representative of the evolution of field spiral galaxies at the median redshift of the vlt and subary field galaxy samples .",
    "we obtain @xmath28 mag at @xmath29 , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ f_sfr_zev ] as the data - point with errorbars .",
    "taken at face value , our analysis yields @xmath30 .",
    "this value could be an overestimate of the rate of evolution for two reasons .",
    "first , in our analysis we have assumed constant ( solar ) metallicity for the spiral galaxies . it is reasonable to expect that the average metallicity of field spirals might have been lower in the past , and , for a given stellar mass , a lower metallicity stellar population is expected to be brighter in @xmath1 ( see , e.g. , bruzual & charlot 2003 ) .",
    "thus , part of the observed luminosity evolution may be caused by a change in the average metallicity of the stellar populations of the galaxies .",
    "however , we expect this effect to be small because the measured evolution in the average metallicity of field galaxies is rather modest ( cf .",
    "kobulnicky et al .",
    "2003 ; lilly , carollo & stockton 2003 ; kobulnicky & kewley 2004 ) . at the median redshift of our field galaxy sample",
    "we expect the average metallicity ( at a given galaxy mass ) to be only @xmath31dex lower than at @xmath32 ( kobulnicky & kewley 2004 ) , which would have negligible effect in our calculation .",
    "the second reason why we may have overestimated the rate of sfr evolution is that any unaccounted for selection effects probably mean that we preferentially select intrinsically brighter galaxies at high-@xmath25 , thus increasing the apparent luminosity evolution .",
    "this rate of sfr evolution is substantially shallower than the rate of evolution of the sfr density of the universe indicated by studies based on the uv , h@xmath8 , far - infrared , and radio emission of galaxies , which all suggest @xmath33@xmath34 between @xmath32 and  @xmath35 ( e.g. , hopkins 2004 ) .",
    "hence , the rapid evolution in the cosmic sfr density is not driven by the evolution in the sfr of individual bright ( @xmath36 ) spiral galaxies like the ones in our sample , in agreement with the conclusions of b05b .",
    "we have carried out mos observation of 4 cluster fields using the focas spectrograph at subaru , and obtained spectra of 103 cluster and field spiral galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the range @xmath0 .",
    "a total of 77 galaxies show emission lines . of these ,",
    "33 galaxies yielded observed rotation curves of good enough quality to determine secure rotation velocities .",
    "our sample reaches roughly @xmath37 at each redshift .    by comparing the rest - frame @xmath1-band tully - fisher relation ( tfr ) of our cluster and field emission - line spiral galaxies",
    ", we found no measurable difference between the @xmath1-band luminosity at a given rotation velocity of both populations .",
    "this agrees with the conclusions of ziegler et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , but disagrees with our own previous vlt results ( milvang - jensen et al . , 2003 ;",
    "bamford et al .",
    "we also find the rest - frame @xmath3 colour of the cluster emission - line galaxies is marginally redder ( by @xmath38 ) than that of the field galaxies , providing little indication that the cluster spirals are undergoing enhanced star formation . on the other hand , we find that the fraction of spiral galaxies with absorption - line spectra ( i.e. , no detectable emission lines ) in the clusters is larger than that in the field by a factor @xmath5@xmath6 , in agreement with the results of dressler et al .",
    "this implies that the cluster environment quenches star - formation on its spiral galaxies , leading , perhaps , to the formation of s0s .    to evaluate the significance of our results",
    ", we carried out simulations of the effects that changes in the star - formation history of in - falling spiral galaxies would have on the observed properties of galaxy samples similar to ours .",
    "following the encounter of the in - falling galaxies with the cluster environment , our models explore different star - formation scenarios , including truncation of the galaxies star - formation on different timescales , possibly preceded by bursts of different strengths .",
    "it turns out that even quite drastic changes in the sfr of the galaxies may have quite modest effect on the average luminosity and colour of a sample of bright cluster spiral galaxies _ selected to have ongoing star - formation _",
    "( i.e. , having the strong emission lines needed for rotation - curve measurement ) . however , the fraction of spiral galaxies with absorption - line spectra ( i.e. , without current star - formation ) is very sensitive to the effect of star - formation truncation .",
    "our subaru observations favour models with relatively mild or absent initial star - bursts , and relatively long star - formation timescales , while the vlt results of bamford et al .",
    "favour a more massive initial star - burst and a shorter time - scale .",
    "however , we estimate the probability that the observed difference between our subaru results and the vlt ones of bamford et al",
    ". arises from `` unlucky '' statistic sampling of galaxy populations with intrinsically similar properties .",
    "we find that both tully - fisher relation results are only different at the @xmath39 level .",
    "this is due to the relatively small sample sizes and the large uncertainties in the determination of the individual tfr offsets . to definitively rule out the presence of a starburst before the star - formation cessation would require samples of @xmath40@xmath41 field and cluster spirals with reasonable determinations of their rotation velocity .",
    "finally , we find that the rest - frame absolute @xmath1-band magnitude ( at a fixed rotation velocity ) of the field galaxies in our sample shows an evolution of @xmath7 mag per unit redshift . by statistically - combining our luminosity evolution estimate with that of bamford et al .",
    "( 2005b ; @xmath27 mag per unit redshift ) , and interpreting it as due to the increase with redshift of the sfr of the galaxies , we estimate that @xmath42 for our field spirals .",
    "this indicates that the average sfr of bright ( @xmath36 ) disk galaxies evolves more slowly than the universal sfr density , suggesting that the evolution of the global sfr evolution is not dominated by bright star - forming disk galaxies , in agreement with previous studies .",
