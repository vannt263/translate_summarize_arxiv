    "the discussion of a nonminimal coupling ( nmc ) of gravity with fields and media has a long history .",
    "the most intensely this topic has been studied in connection with the problem of nonminimal coupling of gravity and scalar field , which has numerous cosmological applications .",
    "the details of the investigations of this problem are discussed , e.g. , in the review of faraoni _",
    "et al_.@xcite the development of the theory of nmc of gravity and scalar field @xmath0 has started by the introduction of the term @xmath1 to the lagrangian ( @xmath2 is the ricci scalar ) . in ref",
    "the special choice @xmath3 has been motivated by the conformal invariance ; in ref .",
    "this quantity was considered as an arbitrary parameter of the model .",
    "such a model has been widely used for the cosmological applications , in which @xmath4 played a role of extra parameter of inflation ( see , e.g. , refs .   ) . in refs .  ",
    "the gauge - invariant term @xmath5 has been introduced instead of @xmath1 in the context of non - abelian gauge theory ( @xmath6  is a multiplet of scalar complex higgs fields interacting with gravity and spinor matter . )",
    "subsequent generalizations have been related to the replacement of @xmath7 by the function @xmath8 ( see , e.g. , refs .   ) , as well as , to the inserting of the terms of the type @xmath9 both linear and nonlinear in the ricci scalar , ricci and riemann tensors ( see , e.g. , refs .   ) .",
    "the idea of nonminimal derivative coupling introduced in ref .   and developed further in refs .",
    "has enriched the nmc modeling by the terms @xmath10 .",
    "nonminimal cosmological models based on the formalism of derivative coupling are the multi - parameter ones and have supplementary abilities for a fitting of observational data .",
    "let us note that the nmc of gravity and scalar field leads to the modifications of both the klein - gordon and the einstein equations , and such modifications are of interest for various inflation scenarios .",
    "thus , the modeling of nonminimal interactions of scalar and gravitational fields is one of the well established and physically motivated branch of modern cosmology .",
    "natural extension of the nonminimal theory from the models with scalar fields coupled to curvature to the models describing scalar fields interacting with gauge fields has the same sound motivation and can disclose new aspects of cosmological dynamics .",
    "the study of the nonminimal coupling of gravity with electromagnetic field has another motivation and another history . in 1971",
    "prasanna@xcite introduced the invariant @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the riemann tensor , @xmath13 is the maxwell tensor ) as a possible element of a lagrangian , and then in ref .",
    "obtained the corresponding nonminimal one - parameter modification of the einstein - maxwell equations . in 1979 novello and salim@xcite proposed to insert the gauge non - invariant terms @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the lagrangian ( @xmath16 is an electromagnetic potential four - vector ) .",
    "a qualitatively new step has been made by drummond and hathrell in ref .  , where the one - loop corrections to the quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) are obtained , which take into account the nonminimal coupling of gravity and electromagnetism .",
    "the lagrangian of such a theory happens to contain three fundamental @xmath17-gauge - invariant scalars @xmath11 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 with coefficients reciprocal to the square of the electron mass .",
    "this lagrangian had no arbitrary parameters , but curvature induced modifications of the electrodynamic equations gave the impetus to wide discussions about the formal structure of the nonminimal lagrangian , basic evolutionary equations , breaking the conformal invariance and the properties of the photons , coupled to curvature in different gravitational backgrounds ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the last paper revived , as well , the interest to the paradigm : curvature coupling and equivalence principle , various aspects of which are now discussed ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "the qed - motivation of the use of the generalized maxwell equations can also be found in the papers of kosteleck and colleagues.@xcite the effect of birefringence induced by curvature , first discussed in ref .  , and some of its consequences for the electrodynamic systems have been investigated in refs .   for the case of pp - wave background .",
    "the generalization of the idea of nonminimal interactions to the case of torsion coupled to the electromagnetic field has been made in refs .",
    "( see , also , ref .   for a review on the problem ) . to summarize we stress that the study of electrodynamic systems nonminimally coupled to the gravity field",
    "poses a natural question about curvature induced variations of photon velocity in the cosmological background .",
    "since the interpretation of observational data in cosmology depends essentially on the velocity of photon propagation during different cosmological epochs , the modeling of nonminimal electrodynamic phenomena seems to be well motivated and interesting from physical point of view .",
    "concerning the nonminimal einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) theory , we can distinguish between two different ways to establish it . the first way is the direct nonminimal generalization of the einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) theory . in the framework of this approach horndeski@xcite and mller - hoissen@xcite obtained the nonminimal one - parameter eym model from a dimensional reduction of the gauss - bonnet action .",
    "now the gauss - bonnet models are of great interest in connection with the problem of dark energy ( see , e.g. , the gauss - bonnet model with nonminimal scalar field@xcite ) . thus , the non - abelian multi - parameter extensions of nonminimal models are also well motivated , since they give a chance to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe without addressing to exotic substance .",
    "we follow the alternative way , which is connected with a non - abelian generalization of the nonminimal einstein - maxwell theory along the lines proposed by drummond and hathrell@xcite for the linear electrodynamics .",
    "based on the results of ref .",
    "a three - parameter gauge - invariant nonminimal eym model linear in curvature is considered.@xcite@xcite our goal is to formulate a nonminimal einstein - yang - mills - higgs ( eymh ) theory , and this process , of course , also admits different approaches .",
    "in fact , the nonminimal eymh theory should accumulate the ideas and methods both from the nonminimally extended eym theory and from the nonminimally extended scalar field theory .",
    "initial attempt to develop nonminimal eymh theory can be found , for instance , in ref .  , where the scalar higgs field is nonminimally coupled with gravity via @xmath20 term , and the higgs field @xmath21 is included into the lagrangian of the yang - mills field in a composition with a square of the yang - mills potential : @xmath22 .",
    "such a theory is not gauge - invariant .    in this paper",
    "we establish a new six - parameter nonminimal einstein - yang - mills - higgs model .",
    "first three coupling parameters , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , describe a nonminimal interaction of yang - mills field and gravitational field .",
    "the fourth and fifth parameters , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , describe the so - called gauge - invariant nonminimal derivative coupling of the higgs field with gravity . since the gauge - invariant derivative , @xmath28 , contains the potential of the yang - mills field , the corresponding nonminimal term is associated with `` triple '' interaction , namely , gravitational and scalar fields , gauge and scalar fields , and gauge and gravitational fields .",
    "the sixth parameter , @xmath4 , is the well - known coupling parameter nonminimally connecting gravitational and scalar fields via the term @xmath29 .",
    "of course , this model is only one of a wide class of the nonminimal eymh models .",
    "as for its motivation and possible physical applications , one can see that on the one hand , the interest to a six - parameter nonminimal eymh model is based on the sound results obtained earlier in the framework of partial nonminimal models ( einstein - maxwell , einstein - yang - mills and scalar field theories ) , on the other hand , the six - parameter model under discussion shows new specific solutions of cosmological type , which can not appear in more simple models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ formalism ] we formulate the nonminimal eymh model , which contains six phenomenological coupling parameters , and establish the nonminimally extended yang - mills , higgs and einstein equations . in sec .",
    "[ ismodel ] we apply the introduced master equations to the spacetime with constant curvature and obtain the specific relationships between coupling constants , which turn the extended equations for the gauge field and scalar field into identities . in subsec .",
    "[ dssptime ] we discuss the exact solutions to the nonminimal eymh equations attributed to the isotropic cosmological model with yang - mills field , characterized by hidden anisotropy .",
    "the minimal einstein - yang - mills - higgs theory can be formulated in terms of the action functional @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the determinant of a metric tensor @xmath32 , @xmath2 is the ricci scalar , latin indices run from 0 to 3 .",
    "the symbol @xmath33 denotes the multiplet of the higgs scalar fields , @xmath34 is a potential of the higgs field and @xmath35 .",
    "let us mention that there are two formal variants to introduce the cosmological constant into the action ( [ act ] ) : first , explicitly as an additional term @xmath36 , second , as a term @xmath37 in the decomposition @xmath38 below we consider the second variant .",
