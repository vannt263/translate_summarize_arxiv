    "the various ways we have learned to write majorana and dirac masses in terms of weyl , majorana , and dirac spinors are collected in table  [ tab : mass ] . as a final exercise ,",
    "i invite you to derive the one entry in this table that we have not yet discussed .",
    "+ _ exercise 1.10 - show that _",

    "the gauge bosons transform as @xmath74 where @xmath75 are the generators of the group .",
    "it is the second term in this transformation that forbids a mass term , @xmath76 where @xmath77 .",
    "thus gauge bosons are massless unless the gauge symmetry is broken .",
    "hence the photon and gluons are massless , while the weak vector bosons naturally have a mass of @xmath78 .",
    "gauge bosons are associated with a local symmetry , but it is not clear which way the logic runs : are they massless because of the local symmetry , or is the local symmetry present because they are massless ?",
    "it s not even clear that it makes sense to think about it either of these ways . for many years physicists considered the local symmetry to be fundamental , but that position is no longer held sacred .",
    "for example , in string theory there are massless , spin - one modes of the string , and at low energy these are described by an effective gauge theory , even though the underlying string theory is not based on gauge symmetry @xcite .",
    "perhaps even more remarkable are supersymmetric field theories with electric - magnetic duality .",
    "there are examples in which the long - distance ( magnetic ) degrees of freedom include massless gauge bosons with a local symmetry , yet the short - distance ( electric ) degrees of freedom do not possess this local symmetry @xcite .    because of its importance , i want to dwell in more detail on the connection between massless gauge bosons and gauge symmetry . for simplicity",
    ", i ll specialize to qed , although the results for a non - abelian gauge theory are analogous .",
    "gauge symmetry implies a ward identity . in the case of the photon self energy @xmath79 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pi ] , the ward identity is @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the photon four momentum .",

    "although it is not evident from our calculation , simply cutting off the integral violates the ward identity , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ward ] ) @xcite : @xmath107 thus the ward identity , which follows from gauge symmetry , is essential to protect the masslessness of the photon .    rather than using a cutoff , we can evaluate the photon self energy in @xmath89 dimensions , which respects the ward identity .",
    "the quadratically divergent integrals give @xmath108 the pole at @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) signals the quadratic divergence .",
    "however , these integrals are multiplied by a factor @xmath111 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pi2 ] ) . using @xmath112",
    "we see that the pole at @xmath109 , and hence the quadratic divergence , was illusory . the quadratic dependence on the cutoff @xmath24 that we discovered above was an artifact of using a regulator that violates the ward identity .",

    "( [ eq : propagator ] ) , we find that the photon propagator still has a pole at @xmath114 , so the photon remains massless , thanks to the ward identity .",
    "thus the standard model successfully explains why fermions and gauge bosons are so much lighter than the hypothesized fundamental scale , @xmath24 .",
    "now let s turn to scalars . here",
    "is where the standard model is not so successful .",
    "a scalar mass term is of the form @xmath115 and this is always allowed regardless of the gauge symmetry .",
    "thus there is no reason for scalars to be light compared to @xmath24 . in the standard model , this would mean that the higgs field would naturally have a mass of @xmath105 , and thus not be available at low energy to break the electroweak symmetry .",
    "there are at least two ways to avoid this conclusion .",
    "one way is to make the scalars goldstone bosons of some broken global symmetry . as we saw in exercise 3.6 ,",
    "goldstone bosons transform as @xmath116 , which forbids a mass term , @xmath117 .",
    "perhaps the higgs field is a ( pseudo)-goldstone boson of some ( approximate ) broken global symmetry .",
    "this is the idea behind the currently popular `` little higgs '' models @xcite .",
    "the other generic way to make scalars massless is to use supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "a scalar field is replaced by a scalar superfield , @xmath118 ( not to be confused with the matrix field @xmath119 of section  [ sec : custodial ] ) .",
    "the superpotential @xmath120 depends only on @xmath119 , not @xmath121 , which is referred to as the property of holomorphy .",
    "if the scalar field transforms under a complex or pseudoreal representation of some global or local group , then a mass term , @xmath122 , is forbidden , exactly as we saw for fermions in section  [ sec : flavor ] .",
    "since supersymmetry connects bosons and fermions , it is not surprising that the same method we used to make fermions light can also be used to make scalars light .",
    "unfortunately , the minimal supersymmetric standard model does not make use of this method .",
    "that model requires two light higgs - doublet superfields , @xmath123 and @xmath124 , with opposite hypercharge , in order to provide masses to both up - type and down - type quarks .",
    "thus a mass term in the superpotential @xmath125 is allowed by the gauge symmetry . however",
    ", this does not mean that supersymmetry is irrelevant to understanding why the higgs scalars are light compared to @xmath24 , as we will discuss shortly .",
    "we conclude that in the standard model , there is no principle to tell us why the higgs mass is light compared to the hypothesized scale of fundamental physics , @xmath24 .",
    "it is not unreasonable to regard this as a merely `` aesthetic '' problem .",
    "however , there is an even worse problem : it is not natural for a scalar mass to be much lighter than @xmath24 .",
    "consider the one - loop contribution to the scalar mass shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : quad_div ] .",
    "this diagram has a genuine quadratic divergence , so the relation between the higgs mass evaluated at low energy and at the scale @xmath24 is @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the higgs - field self coupling , eq .",
    "( [ eq : v ] ) . in order to obtain @xmath128",
    ", two things must happen :    * @xmath129 - this is perfectly natural * @xmath130 must cancel @xmath131 to high accuracy .",
    "there is no principle to enforce this .",
    "this is the famous `` hierarchy problem . ''",
    "a supersymmetric theory has no quadratic divergences , so it solves this `` technical '' aspect of the hierarchy problem . instead",
    ", one is left with the `` aesthetic '' problem we already encountered above .",
    "fortunately , there are dynamical ways to solve this , so this is a much softer version of the hierarchy problem .    to summarize , we have argued that the standard model successfully explains why fermion and gauge boson masses are of @xmath78 , and hence much lighter than the hypothesized scale of fundamental physics , @xmath24 .",
    "however , the standard model fails to explain why the higgs mass , or equivalently @xmath132 , is much lighter than @xmath24 in the first place .",
    "this `` hierarchy problem '' has occupied theorists for a long time , and there are many potential solutions , including :    * perhaps @xmath24 is actually not much larger than @xmath132 , so there is no hierarchy after all .",
    "theories with extra dimensions are a recent attempt along this direction . *",
    "perhaps @xmath24 is only a little bigger than @xmath132 , so it s really only a `` little hierarchy . ''",
    "this is the rationale behind `` little higgs '' models @xcite .",
    "* perhaps @xmath24 really is much larger than @xmath132 , and low - energy supersymmetry makes this natural @xcite . * perhaps there are no fundamental scalars in nature after all , and the electroweak symmetry is broken some other way .",
    "for example , technicolor models break the electroweak symmetry via a fermion - antifermion condensate @xcite .",
    "if there really are no light fundamental scalars in nature , we have an explanation at the ready .",
    "perhaps the hierarchy problem is not a problem at all , but just a successful explanation of why there are no light fundamental scalars .",
    "no amount of deliberation by theorists alone is going to decide which , if any , of these solutions is correct",
    ". experiment will decide .",
    "the fermilab tevatron is already probing the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking , and the cern large hadron collider is sure to give us a lot of information .",
    "our goal is to unravel the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking , perhaps with the assistance of a linear ( @xmath133 ) collider .",
