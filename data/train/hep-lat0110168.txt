    "recently @xcite hasenfratz and knechtli introduced the hypercubic blocking transformation ( hyp ) and used it to study dynamical staggered fermions with greatly improved flavor symmetry . here",
    "we use the hyp blocking as an operator to measure the static potential from wilson loops .",
    "the hyp smearing mixes gauge links within hypercubes attached to the original link only , therefore it has less impact on the short - distance properties of the gauge configurations than repeated levels of ape blocking .",
    "the statistical accuracy of the potential measured with hyp links improves by about _ an order of magnitude_.    we calculated the lowest order perturbative expansion of the lattice coulomb potential of hyp links .",
    "the distortion effect of the smearing is visible at distances @xmath1 but is negligible beyond that . by removing lattice artifacts using the perturbative coulomb potential we could fit the static potential with the continuum form even from distance @xmath2 with low @xmath3 .",
    "this , combined with the improved statistical accuracy at large distances makes it possible to get reliable values for both @xmath4 and @xmath5 even with limited statistics .",
    "a single level of hyp smearing consists of three levels of modified ape smearing , where the staples are restricted in such a way that only links within hypercubes attached to the original link are used .",
    "the construction equations can be found in @xcite .",
    "there are three free ape - blocking parameters @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "these were optimized _ non - perturbatively _ to suppress fluctuations at the plaquette level .",
    "the _ perturbative _ cancellation of the flavor symmetry violating terms at tree level of the staggered hyp action gives consistent values for the blocking parameters @xcite .",
    "the figure shows a schematic representation of the construction in 3d : the fat link is built from the four double - lined staples ( there are six in 4d ) ( a ) , which in turn are constructed from the two +",
    "let the gauge fields for the thin links be @xmath8 and those for the hyp links @xmath9 . in fourier space",
    "they are related as : @xmath10\\!+\\!\\frac{\\alpha_1}6\\hat p_\\mu \\hat p_\\nu\\omega_{\\mu\\nu}(p),\\\\ \\omega_{\\mu\\nu}(p)&\\hspace*{-4mm}=\\hspace*{-4mm}&1+\\alpha_2(1\\!+\\!\\alpha_3)-\\frac{\\alpha_2}4 ( 1\\!+\\!2\\alpha_3)(\\hat p^2\\!-\\!\\hat p_\\mu^2\\!-\\!\\hat p_\\nu^2)\\\\&\\hspace*{-3mm}&+\\frac{\\alpha_2\\alpha_3}4{\\prod_{\\eta\\neq\\mu,\\nu } \\hat p_\\eta^2}\\\\ \\textrm{and}\\",

    "the generalization to other gauge actions modifies the propagator in the above formula .",
    "the improvement in statistics due to the hyp smearing is best seen by comparing the static quark potential measured from wilson loops using thin and hyp links on the _ same configurations_. the set consists of 240 @xmath14 configurations generated with the wilson plaquette action at @xmath15 . the thin link potential has been shifted by an unphysical constant to match the hyp potential for @xmath16 : +        for distances @xmath17 the hyp and thin potential agree well and for larger distances the statistical error in the hyp potential is extremely reduced by the smearing transformation .",
    "this is especially important for a precise measurement of the string tension .",
    "the solid line is a perturbatively improved fit that will be discussed in the following section .",
    "the deviation of @xmath18 from the continuum coulomb potential @xmath19 is best seen in an @xmath20 vs. @xmath21 plot : +        the perturbative calculation captures the short distance distortion of the hyp smearing and the improved rotational symmetry for larger distances .    with this perturbative data one can make a four parameter fit to the lattice data . if we assume that most of the lattice artifacts are captured by @xmath18 we can write @xmath22 as    @xmath23 v_{cont}(r)&=&\\frac{c_0}r+c_1+c_2r\\\\ & & \\textrm{\\small is the continuum potential and}\\\\[1 mm ] \\delta v_{lat}(r)&=&\\widetilde c_0\\left(v_{pert}(r)\\!-\\!v_c(r)\\right)\\\\ & & \\textrm{\\small represents the lattice artifacts.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the four parameters of the improved fit and from @xmath26 and @xmath25 the string tension @xmath27 and sommer scale @xmath4 can be obtained in the usual way .",
    "for both thin and hyp potentials the following plot shows the actual potential data and the  corrected  data , where the lowest order lattice correction is removed , namely : @xmath28 .",
    "the continuum part of the fit , @xmath29 , is shown as a solid line .",
    "the fit uses all data points in the range @xmath30 : +        after removing the lattice artifacts and adjusting an overall constant the thin and hyp measurements match very closely .",
    "the perturbatively corrected potential shows very good rotational symmetry and closely follows the continuum form over the whole range of @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath3 per degree of freedom decreases by about a factor of 10 if we include the perturbative correction in the fit .",
    "the correction of the lattice artifacts is so effective that one can use all the points , even @xmath32 , for fitting . as an example the following plot shows the dependence of @xmath5 on the lower limit of the fit ( @xmath33 ) :        the results for the potential parameters of the @xmath15 quenched lattices from standard jackknife analysis are ( together with data from some large scale simulations at the same coupling value ) : +    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have measured the static potential using hyp smeared links . +    * the hyp potential has greatly reduced statistical errors and shows improved rotational symmetry . + * the short distance potential is distorted + only at @xmath34 . + * the perturbative hyp coulomb potential describes most of these distortions . + * with the perturbative correction potential data even at @xmath34 can be used for fitting .",
    "+    the improved statistical accuracy and the perturbative correction make the hyp potential measurement very effective for the analysis of both quenched and dynamical configurations .",
    "we would like to emphasize that at present other refined techniques , like multi - hit @xcite or multi - level @xcite , are not applicable with dynamical fermions in contrast to the hyp smearing , with which we were able to obtain reliable scale determinations on dynamical lattices even with limited statistics .",
