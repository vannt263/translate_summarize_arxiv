    "recent experimental observations of macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt )  @xcite and energy level quantization  @xcite in high-@xmath0 superconductor josephson junctions ( jjs ) open up the possibility for realizing high-@xmath0 quantum bits .    in ybco grain boundary junctions which was used in mqt experiments  @xcite , it was found that the stray capacitance @xmath1 of the electrodes , due to the large dielectric constant of the sto substrate at low temperature ( @xmath2 ) , and the inductance @xmath3 , due to the large london penetration depth in @xmath4-axis and/or josephson coupling between cuo@xmath5 planes in one of the electrodes have large influence on the macroscopic dynamics and can be taken into account by an extended circuit model ( see fig.1(a ) ) . in fig . 1 , @xmath6 is the phase difference across the josephson junction and @xmath7 is the phase difference across the capacitor @xmath1 , where @xmath8 is the current through the inductor .",
    "it was found that , in the microwave - assisted mqt experiment  @xcite , the bias current @xmath9 dependence of the josephson plasma frequency @xmath10 is quantitatively explained by this model  @xcite .",
    "however , the validity of the extended circuit model for ta and mqt escape processes have not yet been explored .",
    "below we calculate the mqt and ta escape rate base on the extended circuit model and try to compare with experimental results .     for @xmath11 and @xmath12.,width=453 ]",
    "the hamiltonian of the circuit ( fig .",
    "1(a ) ) can be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the josephson coupling energy , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the external current ) .",
    "this hamiltonian describes the quantum dynamics of a fictive particle moving in the 2-dimensional tilted washboard potential @xmath19 ( see fig.1(b ) ) . by introducing the new",
    "coordinate @xmath20 and assuming @xmath21 , we can rewrite the hamiltonian as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the local minimum point , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .    by using the functional integral method  @xcite ,",
    "the partition function of the system can be written as @xmath26 / \\hbar \\right ] , $ ] where @xmath27 $ ] is the euclidean lagrangian .",
    "the lagrangian is a quadratic function of @xmath28 .",
    "therefore the functional integral over variable @xmath28 can be performed explicitly .",
    "then the partition function is reduced to a single functional integral over @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 /\\hbar)$ ] , where the effective action is given by @xmath32 & = & \\int_0^{\\hbar \\beta } d \\tau \\left [ \\frac{1}{2 } m \\dot{x}^2 + u_\\mathrm{1d }   ( x ) \\right ]   + \\frac{1}{4 } \\int_{0}^{\\hbar \\beta } d \\tau \\int_{0}^{\\hbar \\beta } d \\tau ' \\left [ x(\\tau ) - x(\\tau ' ) \\right]^2   k ( \\tau-\\tau ' )   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this equation , @xmath33 $ ] , and @xmath34        }        {        \\sinh \\left [   \\frac { \\hbar \\beta \\omega_{lc } } { 2 }   \\right ]        }        , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the resonance frequency of the lc circuit .",
    "thus the dynamics of the phase difference in the 2d potential @xmath19 can be mapped into simple 1d model .",
    "note that , due to the coupling between the josephson junction and the lc circuit , @xmath36 $ ] contains a `` dissipation '' term ( the second term ) which is nonlocal in imaginary time @xmath37 .",
    "the thermal activation rate well above the crossover temperature is given by  @xcite @xmath38 where the effective trial frequency @xmath39 is a solution of @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the matsubara frequency , @xmath42 is the josephson plasma frequency , and @xmath43 is the damping function .",
    "note that the potential barrier height @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) is not modified even in the presence of the lc circuit .",
    "therefore the coupling to the lc circuit only modifies the prefactor of @xmath46 .",
    "the effective trial frequency @xmath39 and the quantum correction @xmath47 in the prefactor can be calculated analytically , @xmath48 .",
    ", @xmath49 for the non non - adiabatic cases ( @xmath50 ) which is applicable to the mqt experiment in ybco grain - boundary jjs  @xcite . in the case of @xmath51 ,",
    "the prefactor of @xmath46 coincides with the result without dissipative effects  @xcite .",
    "therefore we can conclude that the influence of the coupling to the lc circuit on the thermal activation process is quite weak .",
    "so the system behaves as simple 1d systems well above the crossover temperature .",
    "this result is qualitatively consistent with the experimental observation  @xcite .",
    "the mqt escape rate at zero temperature is defined by @xmath52  @xcite . in order to determine @xmath53",
    ", we use the bounce techniques .",
    "then we get @xmath54 where @xmath55 +   { \\cal s}_\\mathrm{diss } [ x_b])/\\hbar$ ] is the bounce exponent , that is the value of the action @xmath56 evaluated along the bounce trajectory @xmath57 . in the non - adiabatic case ( @xmath58 ) , we get @xmath59   ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the `` dissipation '' correction term is given by @xmath60 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath46 , the coupling to the lc circuit gives rise to an increase of the bounce exponent .",
    "therefore the two - dimensional nature has large influence on the mqt escape process .    in order to check the validity of our model",
    ", we try to compare our result with the experimental data of the switching current distribution at the low temperature regime  @xcite .",
    "the switching current distribution @xmath61 is related to the mqt rate @xmath62 as @xmath63 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the sweep rate of the external bias current . from the experiment  @xcite",
    ", it is found that the measured value of the full width at half maximum ( hmfw ) @xmath65 of @xmath61 is 11.9na at the temperature - independent mqt regime . on the other hand , in order to numerically calculate @xmath65 , we need the information of @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath3 , and @xmath1 .",
    "the values of @xmath68a , @xmath69nh and @xmath70pf were directly determined from the ta and the microwave - assisted mqt experiments  @xcite . therefore the only fitting parameter is @xmath67 . from the numerical estimation of @xmath65",
    ", we found that @xmath71 pf gives good agreement with the experimental value of @xmath65 .",
    "the obtained value of @xmath67 is consistent with the estimated value @xmath72pf based on the geometry of the junction  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the extended circuit model can quantitatively explain the mqt experiment in the ybco grain boundary junctions .",
    "we have theoretically studied the ta and mqt escape for the josephson junction coupled with a lc circuit by taking into account the two - dimensional nature of the phase dynamics .",
    "then we found that the coupling to the lc circuit gives negligible reduction for ta escape rate . on the other hand",
    ", we also found that the mqt escape rate is largely reduced due to the coupling with the lc circuit .",
    "these results are consistent with experimental data of ybco josephson junctions .",
