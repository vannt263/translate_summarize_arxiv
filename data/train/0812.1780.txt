    "energy efficient transmission is of paramount importance in many communication systems and particularly in mobile wireless systems due to the scarcity of energy resources .",
    "energy efficiency can be measured by the energy required to send one information bit reliably .",
    "it is well - known that for gaussian channels subject to average input power constraints , the minimum received bit energy normalized by the noise spectral level is @xmath3 db regardless of the availability of channel side information ( csi ) at the receiver ( see e.g. , @xcite ",
    "golay @xcite showed that this minimum bit energy can be achieved in the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel by pulse position modulation ( ppm ) with vanishing duty cycle when the receiver employs threshold detection .",
    "indeed , turin @xcite proved that any orthogonal @xmath0-ary modulation scheme with envelope detection at the receiver achieves the normalized bit energy of @xmath2 db in the awgn channel as @xmath4 .",
    "it is further shown in @xcite and @xcite that @xmath0-ary orthogonal frequency - shift keying ( fsk ) achieves this minimum bit energy asymptotically as @xmath5 also in noncoherent fading channels where neither the receiver nor the transmitter knows the fading coefficients . as also well - known by now in the digital communications literature @xcite ,",
    "these results are shown by proving that the error probabilities of orthogonal signaling can be made arbitrarily small as @xmath5 as long as the normalized bit energy ( or equivalently @xmath1 per bit ) is greater that @xmath2 db . these studies demonstrate that asymptotically orthogonal signaling is optimally energy efficient and highly resilient to fading even when the receiver performs hard - decision detection . however , these asymptotical performances require operation in the infinite bandwidth regime ( when @xmath6 ) or signaling with unbounded peak - to - average power ratio , i.e. , vanishing duty cycle . in this paper , motivated by practical considerations and limitations , we analyze the non - asymptotic energy efficiency of orthogonal signaling .",
    "we consider @xmath0-ary fsk with finite @xmath0 .",
    "additionally , we investigate the energy efficiency when fsk is combined with on - off keying ( or equivalently ppm ) whose duty cycle is small but nonzero . on - off fsk ( oofsk ) modulation introduces peakedness in both time and frequency , and provides improvements in energy efficiency over on - off keying only or fsk only .",
    "we consider the following channel model @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the discrete input , @xmath9 is the transmitted signal when the input is @xmath8 , and @xmath10 is the received signal during the @xmath11 symbol duration .",
    "@xmath12 is the channel gain .",
    "@xmath12 is a fixed constant in unfaded awgn channels , while in flat fading channels , @xmath12 denotes the fading coefficient .",
    "@xmath13 is a sequence of independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "zero - mean circularly symmetric gaussian random vectors with covariance matrix @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the identity matrix .",
    "we assume that the system has an average energy constraint of @xmath16 .    if @xmath0-ary orthogonal fsk modulation is used for transmission , then @xmath17 and the transmitted signal has an @xmath0 complex - dimensional vector representation .",
    "if @xmath18 , @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 for all @xmath22 .",
    "the phases @xmath23 can be arbitrary .",
    "the received signal @xmath10 and noise @xmath24 are also @xmath0 dimensional .",
    "we assume that the receiver quantizes the received vector @xmath10 by performing energy detection .",
    "in this section , we assume that the transmitter employs fsk modulation and the receiver performs energy detection . in the well - known noncoherent detection of fsk signals , @xmath25 is declared as the detected signal if the @xmath26 component of the received vector @xmath27 has the largest energy , i.e. , @xmath28 note that this decision rule is the maximum likelihood decision rule in awgn , coherent fading , and noncoherent rician fading channels @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . the output of the detector",
    "is denoted by @xmath29 .",
    "note that with energy detection , the channel can be now regarded as a symmetric discrete channel with @xmath0 inputs and @xmath0 outputs .",
    "initially , we consider the awgn channel and assume @xmath30 .",
    "the capacity which is achieved by equiprobable fsk signals is given by is used to denote the logarithm to the base @xmath31 i.e. , the natural logarithm . ]",
    "@xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the probability that @xmath35 given that @xmath36 . using the results on the error probabilities of noncoherent detection of fsk signals",
    "( see e.g. , @xcite ) , we have @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "hence , the capacity can also be expressed as @xmath39 next , we provide the behavior of the capacity in the low-@xmath1 regime .",
    "[ theo : awgnderivfsk ] the first derivative at zero @xmath1 of the capacity @xmath40 in ( [ eq : mcapfsk ] ) is @xmath41 therefore , the bit energy required at zero spectral efficiency is @xmath42    _ proof _ : from ( [ eq : mcapfsk2 ] ) , we can write @xmath43 above , @xmath44 denotes the derivative of the transition probability @xmath45 with respect to @xmath1 at @xmath46 while @xmath47 is the value of the transition probability at @xmath48 .",
    "the result is obtained by noting that @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50    although fsk is energy efficient asymptotically as @xmath5 , proposition [ theo : awgnderivfsk ] shows that for finite @xmath0 , operating at very low @xmath1 levels is extremely energy inefficient as the bit energy requirement increases without bound with decreasing @xmath1 regardless of how large @xmath0 is . as a result",
    ", the minimum bit energy is achieved at a nonzero spectral efficiency , the bandwidth requirement is @xmath51 and the spectral efficiency is defined as @xmath52 bits / s / hz . ] , the value of which can be found through numerical analysis . in @xcite ,",
    "the capacity and cutoff rate of @xmath0-ary fsk is studied in the awgn , coherent rayleigh , and noncoherent rician fading channels and it is noted through numerical results that there exists an optimal code rate for which the required bit energy is minimized . here , we prove that observation for any finite value of @xmath0 .",
    "we note that energy inefficiency at low @xmath1s is not a consequence of hard decision detection .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the first derivative of the fsk capacity is zero even if soft detection is employed .",
    "[ fig : fskawgn ] plots the bit energy @xmath53 curves as a function of spectral efficiency for @xmath0-ary fsk in the awgn channel for different values of @xmath0 .    in all cases , we observe that the minimum bit energy is achieved at a nonzero spectral efficiency @xmath54 , and the bit energy requirements increase to infinity as spectral efficiency decreases to zero .",
    "hence , operation below @xmath54 should be avoided .",
    "another observation is that the minimum bit energy and the spectral efficiency value at which the minimum is achieved decrease with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , when @xmath55 , the minimum bit energy is 7.821 db and is achieved at @xmath56 bits / s / hz . on the other hand , when @xmath57 , the minimum bit energy has decreased to 2.617 db and is now attained at @xmath58 bits / s / hz . on the other hand , as @xmath0 increases , the minimum bit energy is achieved at a higher @xmath1 value . indeed , we can show that @xmath59 hence , if @xmath1 grows logarithmically with increasing @xmath0 , the bit energy @xmath60 approaches @xmath61 db .",
    "the proof of ( [ eq : c / snrlim ] ) is omitted because turin @xcite has already shown that @xmath2 db is achieved if the signal duration increases as @xmath62 , which in turn increases the @xmath1 logarithmically in @xmath0 .",
    "next , we consider fading channels . in coherent fading channels where only the receiver has perfect knowledge of the fading coefficients ,",
    "the average capacity is @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 we also consider noncoherent rician fading channels where neither the transmitter nor the receiver knows the fading coefficients . in this case",
    ", we assume that @xmath66 are i.i.d .",
    "complex gaussian random variables with mean @xmath67 and variance @xmath68 . in the noncoherent rician fading channel",
    ", the capacity of @xmath0-ary fsk modulation is @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 we note that these transition probabilities are obtained from the error probability expressions of fsk modulation in noncoherent rician fading channels ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "since the presence of fading unknown at the transmitter only decreases the performance , we immediately have the following corollary to proposition [ theo : awgnderivfsk ] .",
    "the first derivatives at zero @xmath1 of the capacities @xmath72 and @xmath73 are equal to zero , i.e. , @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , the bit energy required at zero spectral efficiency is infinite in both coherent and noncoherent fading channels , i.e. , @xmath75    figures [ fig : fskcriciank1 ] and [ fig : fskncriciank1 ] plot the bit energy curves for @xmath0-ary fsk transmission over coherent and noncoherent rician fading channels .",
    "as predicted , the bit energy levels for all values of @xmath0 increase without bound as the spectral efficiency decreases to zero .",
    "due to the presence of fading , the minimum bit energies have increased with respect to those achieved in the awgn channel .",
    "for instance , when @xmath76 , the minimum bit energies are now @xmath77 db in the coherent rician fading channel and @xmath78 db in the noncoherent rician fading channel .",
    "we again observe that the minimum bit energy decreases with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "[ fig : minbitenergy_vs_m2 ] provides the minimum bit energy values as a function of @xmath0 in the awgn and noncoherent rician fading channels with different rician factors . in all cases , the minimum bit energy decreases with increasing @xmath0",
    ". however , fig .",
    "[ fig : minbitenergy_vs_m2 ] indicates that approaching @xmath2 db is very slow and demanding in @xmath0 .    in this figure",
    ", we also note the energy penalty due to the presence of unknown fading .",
    "but , as the rician factor @xmath79 increases , the noncoherent rician channel approaches to the awgn channel and so do the minimum bit energy requirements . figures [ fig : spectraleff_vs_m ] and [ fig : snr_vs_m ] plot the spectral efficiencies and average received @xmath1 values at which @xmath80 is achieved as a function of @xmath0 . as also observed in figs .",
    "[ fig : fskawgn ] and [ fig : fskncriciank1 ] , @xmath80 is achieved at lower spectral efficiencies as @xmath0 increases . from fig .",
    "[ fig : spectraleff_vs_m ] , we note that the required spectral efficiencies are lower and hence the bandwidths requirements are higher in noncoherent fading channels . in fig .",
    "[ fig : snr_vs_m ] , we see that the @xmath1 levels at which @xmath80 is achieved increases with increasing @xmath0 . as predicted in ( [ eq : c / snrlim ] ) , the increase is logarithmic in @xmath0 in the awgn channel .",
    "similar rates of increase are also noted for noncoherent fading channels .",
    "in the previous section , we have seen that the minimum bit energy decreases as the number of orthogonal frequencies , @xmath0 , increases .",
    "another technique to improve the energy efficiency is to increase the peakedness of the signal in the time domain . in @xcite",
    ", we have introduced the on - off frequency - shift keying ( oofsk ) modulation by overlaying frequency - shift keying on on - off keying . in @xmath0-ary oofsk modulation , the transmitter either sends no signal with probability @xmath81 or sends one of @xmath0 orthogonal fsk signals each with probability @xmath82 . in this setting , @xmath83 $ ] can be seen as the duty cycle of the transmission .",
    "while the fsk signals have energy @xmath84 , the average energy of oofsk modulation is @xmath85 .",
    "hence , the peak - to - average power ratio of oofsk is @xmath86 .",
    "no transmission is denoted by @xmath87 .",
    "the fsk signals have the following geometric representations : @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "note that in @xmath0-ary oofsk modulation , we have @xmath90 possible input signals including the no signal transmission .",
    "we again assume that the received signal is hard - decision detected at the receiver . in @xcite , maximum a posteriori probability ( map ) detection rule for oofsk modulation is identified and the error probability expressions are obtained .",
    "the optimal detection rule is given by the following : @xmath25 for @xmath91 is detected if @xmath92 @xmath93 and @xmath94 where @xmath95 ^ 2}{4\\alpha^2 } & \\xi \\ge 1 \\\\ 0 & \\xi < 1 \\end{array}\\right.$ ] , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 . no transmission and hence @xmath98 is detected if @xmath99 @xmath100 .",
    "after hard - decision detection , the channel can be regarded as a discrete channel with @xmath90 inputs and @xmath90 outputs . from the error probability analysis in @xcite",
    ", we have the following expressions for the transition probabilities in the awgn channel : @xmath101 for @xmath102 , and @xmath103 in the above expressions , @xmath104 is the marcum @xmath105-function @xcite , and @xmath106 is the functional inverse of the zeroth order modified bessel function of the first kind .",
    "the rate achieved by the @xmath0-ary oofsk modulation with duty cycle @xmath107 and equiprobable fsk signals is @xmath108 it is shown in @xcite that in the awgn channel , the capacity with soft detection of oofsk signaling has a zero slope at @xmath48 .",
    "since hard - decision detection decreases the capacity , we can immediately conclude that @xmath109 for any fixed nonzero value of @xmath107 , and hence the bit energy required at zero spectral efficiency is still infinite . on the other hand , we know from @xcite and @xcite that if the duty cycle @xmath107 vanishes simultaneously with @xmath1 , the minimum bit energy of @xmath2 db can be achieved .",
    "the following result identifies the rate at which @xmath107 should decrease as @xmath1 gets smaller .      _",
    "proof : _ note that as @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "it can also be seen that @xmath117 and @xmath118 as @xmath1 diminishes . from ( [ eq : transitionproboofsk2 ] ) , we immediately note that @xmath119 and @xmath120 for @xmath121 . in ( [ eq : transitionproboofsk3 ] ) , all the terms in the summation other than for @xmath122 vanishes because @xmath123 .",
    "therefore , in order for @xmath124 for @xmath125 to approach 1 , we need @xmath126 .",
    "also note that if @xmath126 , then we can observe from ( [ eq : transitionproboofsk4 ] ) and ( [ eq : transitionproboofsk5 ] ) that @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "hence , eventually all crossover error probabilities will vanish and correct detection probabilities will be 1 .    in @xcite , it is shown that @xmath129 from this lower bound we can immediately see that @xmath130 if @xmath131 note that both @xmath132 and @xmath133 grow without bound as @xmath114 .",
    "recall that @xmath134 ^ 2}{4\\alpha^2}$ ] .",
    "equivalently , we have @xmath135 . using the asymptotic form @xmath136 @xcite for large @xmath137",
    ", we can easily show that @xmath138 @xmath139 if @xmath140 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath107 decays at this rate , the error probabilities go to zero .",
    "it can then be shown that @xmath141 .",
    "since results hold for any @xmath112 , letting @xmath142 gives the desired result .",
    "@xmath50    we note that zheng _ et al .",
    "_ have shown in @xcite that the low @xmath1 capacity of unknown rayleigh fading channel can be approached by on - off keying if @xmath143 .",
    "we see a similar behavior here when fsk signals are sent over the awgn channel and envelope detected .    in coherent fading channels where the receiver has perfect knowledge of the fading coefficients , the transition probabilities are the same as those in ( [ eq : transitionproboofsk2])-([eq : transitionproboofsk5 ] ) with the only difference that we now have @xmath144 .",
    "as a result , the achievable rates @xmath145 are also dependent on the fading coefficients and average achievable rates are obtained by finding the expected value @xmath146 .    in noncoherent rician fading channels ,",
    "the transition probabilities @xcite are @xmath147 for @xmath102 , and @xmath148 in the above expressions , @xmath149 , @xmath150 the achievable rates can be obtained from ( [ eq : achievableoofsk ] ) .",
    "if @xmath151 , then following the same steps as in the proof of theorem [ theo : oofskasympt ] , we can show that the minimum bit energy of @xmath2 db is achieved as @xmath152 if @xmath110 .    figs .",
