    "recent progress in the emerging fields of nanoelectromechanical @xcite and optomechanical systems @xcite promises to enable quantum limited control of a single macroscopic mechanical degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "this is relevant in the context of high precision measurements @xcite-@xcite like single spin magnetic resonance force microscopy @xcite ( mrfm ) and for fundamental studies of the quantum to classical transition @xcite .",
    "a paradigmatic goal which has triggered a surge of activity is to prepare the eingenmode associated to an ultra long lived mechanical resonance ( angular frequency @xmath0 and @xmath1-value @xmath2 ) in its quantum ground state with high fidelity @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the considerable difficulty to achieve the desired combination @xmath3 , @xmath4 with state of the art micro - fabrication and cryogenic techniques @xcite has naturally motivated ideas to use cooling schemes analogous to the laser - cooling of atoms @xcite-@xcite .    in these schemes",
    "the mechanical resonator s displacement is coupled parametrically to an auxiliary high frequency bosonic or fermionic resonator ( pseudospin ) that can act as a `` cooler '' @xcite .",
    "to drive the latter while monitoring its output allows detection of the mechanical displacement .",
    "naturally there is a back - action force associated to this measurement process @xcite . due to the dissipative dynamics of the cooler for a negative detuning of the drive this force becomes anti - correlated with the brownian motion resulting in net cooling . in turn the quantum fluctuations of the cooler  which in the atomic laser cooling manifest in the inherent stochastic nature of the spontaneous photon emissions  result in a quantum noise spectrum for this backaction force that sets a fundamental lower bound for the final temperature @xcite .",
    "thus the structured reservoir afforded by the driven cooler and its environment provides an effective thermal bath for the mechanical resonator .",
    "the concomitant absorptions of motional quanta ( cooling ) correspond to raman scattering processes in which a drive quanta is up converted , while emission events ( heating ) are associated to raman processes in which a drive quanta is down converted [ cf .",
    "[ fig : fp](b ) ] .",
    "a host of concrete realizations of the above generic scenario have been discussed in the literature .",
    "these range from electronic or electrical devices where the cooler is provided by a ( superconducting ) single electron transistor @xcite , a cooper - pair box @xcite , an lc - circuit @xcite , or a quantum dot @xcite ; to optomechanical systems where this role is played by an optical cavity mode @xcite . in the latter systems , which are equivalent to a fabry - perot with a moving mirror [ cf .",
    "[ fig : fp](a ) ] , the optical field couples parametrically to the mechanical motion via radiation pressure .",
    "this effect has already been thoroughly demonstrated experimentally @xcite and harnessed to provide appreciable cooling , albeit in the classical regime @xcite .",
    "recent experiments involve both optical and microwave cavities . in turn",
    "completely analogous effects have been shown using a capacitively coupled radio frequency lc - circuit @xcite and a superconducting microwave cavity @xcite .",
    "these systems share the common feature that the cooler is well approximated by a single harmonic oscillator which henceforth will be referred to as the `` cavity '' .",
    "while for optical cavities the vacuum constitutes an excellent approximation for the input when the drive is switched off , in the case of radio and microwave frequencies thermal noise in the cavity needs to be taken into account .",
    "a quantum treatment of the corresponding temperature limits has already been given which predicts that ground state cooling is possible when the mechanical oscillation frequency is larger than the cavity s linewidth @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "here we provide a rigorous analysis of the cooling dynamics that drives the mechanical resonator mode to a thermal state with a well defined effective final temperature that for a finite @xmath2 is imprinted on the cavity s output .",

'' ] [ fig : fp ] ]    the above picture is only valid for perturbative optomechanical coupling and thus breaks down when the resulting cooling rate becomes comparable to the cavity linewidth @xmath5 or to the mechanical oscillation frequency @xcite @xmath0 . in the doppler limit",
    "@xmath10 the system then approaches the parametric instability or settles into a regime where backaction effects are purely diffusive with no net cooling .",
    "on the other hand in the resolved sideband limit @xmath11 as the optomechanical coupling exceeds the cavity linewidth the system enters into a strong coupling regime in which the motion hybridizes with the cavity fluctuations .",
    "the ensuing optomechanical normal modes are then cooled simultaneously .",
    "this phenomenon is analyzed in sec .",
    "[ nonpert ] in the limit of small cavity linewidth where we find that the dynamics of each of the normal modes can be described by a master equation analogous to the one valid in the perturbative regime with a cooling rate given by half the cavity linewidth .",
    "finally , in the same section we derive an analytical expression for the final ( steady state ) average mechanical occupancy ( phonon number ) valid for arbitrary optomechanical coupling and use it to optimize the parameters of the drive .",
    "in optomechanical systems ( and their electromechanical analogues ) the cavity resonant frequency @xmath12 depends inversely on a characteristic length that is modified by the mechanical resonator s displacement . the fact that @xmath13 allows for an adiabatic treatment of this effect which results in the aforementioned parametric coupling . in general the leading contribution to the latter",
    "is linear in the mechanical displacement  but situations in which it is instead quadratic can be readily engineered @xcite .",
    "the desired cooling dynamics is induced by a slightly detuned electromagnetic drive ( angular frequency @xmath14 ) , which for optomechanical systems corresponds to an incident laser and in the electromechanical case is afforded by a suitable external ac voltage .",
    "thus the hamiltonian describing the coupled system ( in a rotating frame at @xmath14 ) is given by @xcite @xmath15 here @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is the annihilation operator for the electromagnetic ( mechanical ) oscillator and @xmath18 is the detuning of the drive from @xmath12 .",
    "here we have defined @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the input power of the drive and @xmath21 is the cavity decay rate into the associated outgoing electromagnetic modes .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath6 , characterizing the non - linear coupling between the cavity and the mechanical resonator , is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the zero point motion of the mechanical resonator mode and the characteristic length @xmath24 depends on the physical realization . in the optomechanical case it corresponds to an effective optical cavity length while for electromechanical realizations @xcite @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the dynamical capacitance",
    ", @xmath27 is the distance between the corresponding electrodes , and @xmath28 is the total capacitance .    we treat the losses induced by the electromagnetic and mechanical baths within the rotating wave born - markov approximation using the standard lindblad form liouvillians @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the validity of a rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) in the environmental coupling responsible for the mechanical losses only amounts to @xmath4 provided the optomechanical coupling is weak enough that there is no appreciable mixing between the annihilation and creation operators of the modes ( cf .",
    "[ nonpert ] ) .",
    "clearly if the latter is not satisfied the usual rwa will result in the unwarranted neglection of resonant terms .",
    "this can be borne out by comparing the corresponding displacement spectra and results in the condition @xmath29 .",
    "henceforth we focus on parameters that satisfy it which include the most relevant regimes for cooling and ensure that the system doe not approach the instability for any detuning .",

    "naturally the thermal noise is determined by the bose number @xmath32 . at room temperature and for optical frequencies",
    "@xmath33 is negligible , however for the much lower radio and microwave frequencies characterizing electromechanical setups this quantity can be comparable to the final mechanical occupancies achieved .",
    "similarly @xmath34 is the mechanical resonator s natural linewidth and @xmath35 its mean occupation number at thermal equilibrium ( i.e.  in the absence of the drive ) .    to study the cooling process it proves useful to apply a canonical transformation of the form @xmath36 , @xmath37 with the amplitudes @xmath8 , @xmath38 chosen so that the linear terms in the transformed liouvillian cancel out .",
    "this condition leads to the following coupled equations for the amplitudes @xmath39 we assume @xmath40 and that the mechanical dissipation rate @xmath41 is much smaller than @xmath0 .",
    "to lowest order in the small parameters @xmath6 and @xmath42 we obtain @xmath43 and @xmath44 . here",
    "@xmath45 is the steady state occupancy of the cavity in the absence of optomechanical coupling and @xmath38 is the static shift of the mechanical amplitude due to the radiation pressure .",
    "the normal coordinates after the transformation are shifted so that the new amplitudes correspond to the deviation from the steady state equilibrium position .",
    "this transformation leaves the dissipative part of the liouvillian invariant and transforms the hamiltonian into : @xmath46 where we have introduced the effective detuning @xmath47 .",
    "it is interesting to note that if the bosonic cooler is replaced by a fermionic one so that @xmath48 we obtain a hamiltonian that resembles the one describing a trapped ion in the lamb - dicke regime . as a result for perturbative @xmath6 ( as analyzed in the next section ) the cooling cycle [ cf .",
    "[ fig : fp](b ) ] becomes analogous to the lamb - dicke regime of atomic laser - cooling @xcite .",
    "we first focus on the regime in which the input laser power @xmath20 is low enough so that the time scales over which the populations of the mechanical resonator s fock states evolve ( leading to cooling or heating ) are much slower than those associated to the losses of the cavity and to the free mechanical frequency .",
