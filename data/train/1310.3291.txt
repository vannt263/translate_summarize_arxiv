    "the identification of genomic regions that are unusually rich in a given pattern is a recurring problem in bioinformatics , quite widespread in the analysis of data generated by deep - sequencing .",
    "an example of this is the detection of regions with an unlikely high clustering of chromosomal translocation breakpoints ( @xcite ) .",
    "recurrent chromosomal translocations are associated with hematopoietic malignancies such as leukemia and lymphoma and with some sarcomas and carcinomas ( @xcite ) .",
    "there is growing evidence that translocations are not random . among basic determinants of these events",
    "are the existence of chromosome territories , active transcription and most prominently targeted dna damage ( @xcite ) .",
    "dna double strand breaks ( dsbs ) are necessary intermediates in chromosome rearrangements and they occur in the cell during normal metabolic processes , and can be induced by genotoxic agents or during physiological dna recombination in lymphocytes .",
    "the majority of human lymphomas are of mature b cell origin and many of them carry balanced chromosomal translocations that involve immunoglobulin genes ( @xcite ) .",
    "this susceptibility is most likely dependent on activation - induced cytidine deaminase ( aid ) , the b lymphocyte specific enzyme that initiates class switch recombination ( csr ) and somatic hypermutation ( shm ) , two processes nevessary for antibody diversification ( @xcite ) .",
    "aid initiates shm and csr by deaminating cytosines in immunoglobulin genes during stalled transcription ( @xcite ) .",
    "several dna repair pathways process the resulting u : g mismatch to introduce mutations or produce targeted dsb ( @xcite ) .",
    "besides being targeted to immunoglobulin genes , aid targets a large number of non - immunoglobulin genes ( @xcite ) .",
    "aid induced dsbs are recognised by dna damage response ( ddr ) proteins and repaired by non - homologous end joining ( nhej ) , a process that can fail and result in chromosomal translocations ( @xcite ) .",
    "libraries of aid dependent translocations from primary b cells revealed many discrete sites throughout the genome that are targeted by aid . some of these targets are known translocation partners identified in mature b cell lymphomas @xcite .",
    "mutations in the components of dna repair pathways that process aid induced breaks can lead to defective csr and the most severe defect is documented in 53bp1 deficient b cells .",
    "53bp1 is a dna repair protein that regulates dsb processing and is required for genomic stability .",
    "it does so by facilitation distal dsb joining and by protecting dna ends from resection ( @xcite ) .",
    "the landscape of aid induced translocations in 53bp1 deficient b cells is different from the one found in wild type cells .",
    "deep sequencing of translocation capture libraries from primary 53bp1 deficient b lymphocytes has shown that the profile of translocation hotspots changes most likely due to increased dna end resection ( @xcite ) .    a quantitative method to determine the clustering of translocations was essential for the analysis of chromosomal rearrangements in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "translocation hotspots were determined by using a technique similar to that used to define the coordinates of enriched protein binding regions in chip - seq experiments .",
    "a translocation cluster is defined by concatenating closely spaced adjacent breakpoints and its significance is then determined by using a test based on the negative binomial distribution .",
    "this method assumes that the observed breakpoints are a realisation of a bernoulli process . by taking advantage of this model here we consider a different approach for the detection of hotspots based on the use of scan statistics , @xcite .",
    "the scan statistic is particularly suited in the current setting because if provides a genome - wide significance level to breakpoint clustering . using our method we are able to show that translocation hotspots induced by aid in activated b lymphocytes are longer than those previously identified by the local method .",
    "furthermore , our method shows that long hotspots are more frequent in the absence of 53bp1 .",
    "the frequency of the long hotspots is further increased if aid is overexpressed in 53bp1 deficient b cells .",
    "we also discover a set of hotspots exclusively found by the scan statistic and discuss the potential biological relevance of our findings .",
    "several methods have been developed to detect clustering of events when the observations arise from a spatial or temporal point process .",
    "this section describes the application of the scan statistic for the detection of genomic regions with a particularly high density of translocations .",
    "we also describe explicitly a technique previously used by @xcite , and @xcite , which attributes a local significance level to a hotspot .",
    "a mayor difference between these methods is that the scan statistic provides a global chromosome - wide significance level to clustering .",
    "we model the occurrence of translocation breakpoints in a chromosome of length @xmath5 as realisation of an independent and identically distributed sequence of 0 - 1 bernoulli random variables , @xmath6 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 for @xmath10 .",
    "the event @xmath11 occurs if there is a translocation breakpoint at the @xmath12-th base .",
    "we refer hereafter to this model as the global chromosome null hypothesis , @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath14 be a positive integer and then let @xmath15 be the running number of successes in a window of width @xmath14 .",
    "the scan statistic @xmath16 is defined as the maximum number of successes within any of the @xmath17 consecutive windows , @xmath18 the significance of a cluster of translocation events in a window of width @xmath14 can be assessed by the probability of the tail event @xmath19 .",
    "small probabilities for this event indicate departures for the bernoulli model consistent with @xmath13 and could therefore be used to detect hotspots . a considerable effort has been made in order to derive the distribution of @xmath16 under @xmath13 . still in this simple case",
    "its form has remained elusive .",
    "several approximations and asymptotics for the distribution of the scan statistic have been derived under the bernoulli model , particularly when the number of observed events in @xmath5 trials , @xmath20 , are known . following @xcite ,",
    "the conditional probability @xmath21 may be approximated by the function @xmath22 with @xmath23 as the hypergeometric distribution , @xmath24    although the expression in ( [ eqn : naus ] ) already provides a method to quantify the significance of a cluster , the following asymptotic version avoids the use of the hypergeometric distribution and allows for an efficient implementation . for sufficiently large @xmath14 and @xmath5 , the function in ( [ eqn : naus ] )",
    "may be approximated by @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the binomial distribution for @xmath20 trials and success probability @xmath27 .",
    "this approximation is ensured by weak convergence of the hypergeometric distribution towards the binomial law for large populations and becomes very accurate in the current application where @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , for large values of @xmath20 , namely for @xmath30 as is the case for most chromosomes in the data sets considered here , the summation in ( [ eqn : prepvalue ] ) may be evaluated as @xmath31 with @xmath32 as gauss hypergeometric function , that is , for @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 as the @xmath39th pochhammer symbol of @xmath40 , i. e. @xmath41 .",
    "note that the second argument of @xmath42 is always negative or zero because @xmath43 .",
    "the series defining @xmath32 is thus finite . with this simplification",
    "the desired @xmath44-value @xmath45 is approximately @xmath46    we observe that ( [ eqn : prepvalue ] ) is the approximation for the probability of @xmath47 described by @xcite in the well known continuous case , namely when @xmath5 points are drawn uniformly from @xmath48 and @xmath16 is the largest number of points to be found in any subinterval of @xmath48 of length @xmath14 . despite of the existence of several other approximations for the probability of @xmath49",
    ", @xcite observes that this approximation is quite precise when the right side of ( [ eqn : prepvalue ] ) is less or equal to 0.01 and recommends its use in this regime .",
    "the detection of chromosomal translocation breakpoints via scan statistics has also been considered by several authors in the analysis of leukemias , see @xcite .",
    "these analysis are based on the method described by @xcite , by following a large deviation approximation for the probability of @xmath50 described in @xcite .",
    "although being derived by using rather different arguments , @xcite observe that this approximation and the one in ( [ eqn : naus ] ) produce similar results .",
    "the method outlined in section  [ subsec : ss ] provides a significance test for the existence of hotspots , still their actual number and location have to be determined . here",
    "we describe a method to infer the coordinates of these events .",
    "a chromosome - wide scan with a window of width @xmath14 leads to the consideration of the following sequence of local null hypotheses . for @xmath51 , @xmath52 let @xmath53 be the observed number of translocation events in the @xmath39-th window , @xmath54 .",

    "let @xmath65 be the remaining connected regions in @xmath64 after trimming .",

    "the significance of each element in @xmath65 is computed by observing its length , say @xmath66 , via ( [ eqn : thepvalue ] ) by taking @xmath67 .",
    "the hotspots here were defined by using @xmath68 . the method based on the scan statistic with window width @xmath69 ( in base pairs )",
    "is denoted ss@xmath70 hereafter .",
    "although we considered several widths , we only present results for the cases ss@xmath71 and ss@xmath72 .",
    "the probabilistic model for the occurrence of translocations described in section  [ subsec : ss ] is implicit in previous work made by @xcite and @xcite while analysing hostspots .",
    "the data consisting of the genome translocation breakpoints is represented as a bernoulli process with success probability @xmath44 , estimated as @xmath73 with @xmath5 as the genome length and @xmath20 as the total number of observed translocation events .",

    "the random variable @xmath76 records therefore the length until the next translocation starting at @xmath80 , namely @xmath81 .",
    "the independence of the underlying bernoulli process implies that @xmath76 is a geometric random variable with parameter @xmath44 , that is @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "small values for @xmath84 may thus be used to detect unusual short distances between successive translocation events . in this sense ,",
    "a hotspot can be defined by concatenating adjacent segments for which @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is a given significance level specified in advance .",

    "let @xmath88 so that the significance of this hotspot may be quantified by the @xmath44-value @xmath89 this probability is directly available because @xmath90 is a negative binomial random variable with parameters @xmath91 and @xmath73 , that is @xmath92 this method was used by @xcite and @xcite to define a set of potential hotspots by taking @xmath93 .",
    "any candidate of this set is then identified as a hotspot if : + ( _ i _ ) it has more than 3 translocation breakpoints , + ( _ ii _ ) it has at least one read from each of the two sides of the bait , + ( _ iii _ ) at least 10% of the translocations come from each side of the bait , + ( _ iv _ ) @xmath94 .",
    "hereafter , we refer to this procedure as the local method and denote it by nb@xmath95 .",

    "the genome - wide scan for hotspots according to the method described in section  [ sec : ss_hs ] is implemented by a program we call . is written in perl and r , and depends on the perl modules parallel::forkmanager and math::gsl::sf , available via cpan search ( http://search.cpan.org [ http://search.cpan.org ] ) .",

    "the analysis of genes targeted by aid that are discovered by and nb methods was made by using _ webgestalt _ ( @xcite ) . the set of genes targeted by aid was compared with the mouse genome using the hypergeometric test followed by correction for multiple testing using the benjamini & hochberg method at a significance level of top10 .",
    "the high level functional classification was based upon _ go slim _ for all three major go term categories , namely biological process , cellular component and molecular function .",
    "the methods described in sections [ sec : ss_hs ] and [ sec : nb_hs ] are compared by plotting the distribution of the hotspot lengths defined by each . because the observed hotspot lengths vary across several orders , we considered the logarithm of their actual length .",
    "the results obtained by analysing the four data sets described in section  [ sec : data ] are presented in figure  [ fig : hs_lengths ] . the analysis done with ss@xmath72 shows that the hotspot length distribution is roughly characterised by two components , one with a mean length of @xmath102 base pairs and the other with mean length equal to @xmath103 .",
    "table s1 presents the means , variances and the weights of these components .",
    "let @xmath104 and @xmath105 be the weight of the short and long hotspots components respectively . while the mean position of these components remains almost the same , the relative weight of long to short hotspots , @xmath106 , does shows significant changes . a comparison of the @xmath98 data set ( figure  [ fig : hs_lengths].d ) and the @xmath100 data set ( figure  [ fig : hs_lengths].b ) reveals that the relative frequency of long hotspots is higher in the absence of 53bp1 .",
    "indeed , the value for @xmath107 in the @xmath100 sample is 1.95 , while for the @xmath98 sample it is four times smaller , namely @xmath108 .",
    "we conclude that 53bp1 decreases the proportion of long hotspots .",
    "a similar effect of 53bp1 deficiency is observed in the absence of aid .",
    "indeed , the @xmath101 sample ( figure  [ fig : hs_lengths].a ) is characterised by @xmath109 while the @xmath99 sample ( figure  [ fig : hs_lengths].c ) by @xmath110 . we conclude that in the absence of 53bp1 longer hotspots are more frequent regardless of aid expression .",
    "this effect can be attributed to the role of 53bp1 in dna end protection . in the absence of this protein dna end resection",
    "is increased resulting in longer hotspots as suggested previously @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the plots that present the @xmath99 and @xmath98 samples ( figures  [ fig : hs_lengths].c , [ fig : hs_lengths].d respectively ) shows no substantial changes in the proportion of short to long hotspots , with @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "however , in the absence of 53bp1 the frequency of longer hotspots increases significantly when aid is overexpressed ( figures  [ fig : hs_lengths].a , [ fig : hs_lengths].b ) .",
    "thus , proper dna repair that is dependent on 53bp1 ensures the predominance of short hotspots , evend when aid is overexpressed .",
    "most of these results are not observed when analysing the same data by the local method described in section  [ sec : nb_hs ] .",
    "this becomes clear by inspection of the dashed lines in figure  [ fig : hs_lengths ] , which correspond to the length distributions for hotspots detected by nb@xmath96 and nb@xmath97 .",
    "even at @xmath112 , for which one would expect longer hotspots , the local method is unable to detect the changes in the frequency of the long hotspots to the extent brought by .",
    "it is important to note that by following ( [ eqn : localmaxgap ] ) , the local method would classify two consecutive breakpoints as being part of a hotspot if their distance is smaller than @xmath113 .",
    "using larger values for @xmath86 allows thus for larger gaps .",
    "values above 0.05 would however correspond to tests with type i errors higher to what is commonly acceptable .",
    "sample , b for @xmath100 , c for @xmath99 and d for @xmath98 .",
    "the distributions for the hotspots determined with ss@xmath72 are shown in blue whereas those for nb@xmath97 and nb@xmath96 respectively in magenta and orange .",
    "each graph corresponds to a ( gaussian ) kernel density estimate of the underlying distribution.,width=415 ]    the results in figure  [ fig : hs_lengths ] present the differences in the hotspot lengths defined by the scan statistic and the local method .",
    "however , they do not provide any information about the relative positions of the hotspots detected by either technique . to address this aspect , we analysed the relative hotspot positions for all four data sets described in section  [ sec : data ] .",
    "as an example figure  [ fig : circos ] presents the hotspots for chromosome 9 estimated via @xmath114 , ss@xmath71 and ss@xmath72 .",
    "a comparison of the hotspots found by nb@xmath96 ( figure  [ fig : circos].a ) and those by the scan statistic with a relatively small window , namely by ss@xmath71 ( figure  [ fig : circos].c ) , shows that the hotspots defined by either method share the same location . however , the analysis with ss@xmath72 ( figure  [ fig : circos].c ) reveals the existence of longer hotspots which include one or few smaller hotspots found by nb@xmath96 .",
    "the merging of several smaller hotspots into a larger one is justified by the sparsity of the data which only becomes apparent at larger scales .",
    "these features are clearly overseen by nb method because of its local nature .",
    "few examples of the scaling effect are shown by the examples in figures  [ fig : circos].d , [ fig : circos].f and [ fig : circos].g .",
    "these results are consistent with those observed for other chromosomes ( see figures s1-s2 )",
    ".    over expression of aid in the absence of 53bp1 results not only in the increase of the number of translocation but also defines larger regions where these events cluster .",
    "in addition aid overexpression in @xmath115 cells results in a elongation of pre - existing hotspot regions . this is apparent when comparing the outermost track and the neighboring one on the circular graph that corresponds to the analysis with ss@xmath72 ( figure  [ fig : circos].c ) for the @xmath101 and the @xmath100 data .",
    "the analysis of the same data with a larger scanning window , namely with ss@xmath72 , gives a similar result but the afected regions are much larger ( figure  [ fig : circos].b ) .",
    "the length of most hotspots in this situation is greatly reduced in 53bp1 suficient samples .",
    "this is apparent for the hotspots from the @xmath100 and the @xmath98 data .",
    "interestingly , the effect of 53bp1 correlates with the significance of the hotspots .",
    "we conclude that hotspot length is dependent on 53bp1 and that aid overexpression in the absence of 53bp1 results in translocations that cluster over large regions .",
    "most of the more prominent hotspots are defined by both the scan statistic and the local method ( figures  [ fig : circos].a , c and figures s1.a , c and s2.a , c ) .",
    "however , both methods reveal exclusive clustering regions ( tables s2 , s3 ) . in order to identify aid - dependent hotspots that are exclusive to each method , we compared the @xmath98 and the @xmath99 data .",
    "we found 36 exclusive hotspots with ( see table s2 ) and 27 exclusive hotspots with nb@xmath97 and nb@xmath116 ( see table s3 ) .",
    "the exclusive hotspots obtained by the scan statistic were defined using different window widths ( 50 , 100 , 150 , 250 , 500 , 1000 , 2500 , and 5000 bp ) .",
    "regions that are identified as exclusive aid hotspots were also analysed for several biologically relevant markers .",
    "first , we analysed whether our exclusive hotspots correlate with replication protein a ( rpa ) binding sites in activated b cells @xcite .",
    "the sites of rpa accumulation have been shown to overlap well with aid targets genome - wide and it was proposed that rpa marks aid induced dna double strand breaks .",
    "further , we analysed the overlap with sites where rna polymerase ii ( _ polii _ ) accumulates as it was shown that transcription is necessary for aid targeting ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also analysed the overlap with known fragile regions , namely by the early replicating fragile sites ( erfs ) and common fragile sites ( cfs ) @xcite .",
    "the results of all these comparisons are summarised in tables s2 and s3 .",
    "a total of 20 of the 36 ( 55.5% ) exclusive hotspots found by the scan statistic were common to all sites .",
    "notably , all of these sites are associated with the _ polii _ signal ( table s2 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "only 8 of the 27 ( 29.6% ) exclusive hotspots of the local method fall within these sites and 6 are associated with the _ polii _ signal ( table s3 ) .",
    "thus , the hotspots defined by the scan statistic show higher correlation with active transcription , rpa accumulation and common fragile sites than those defined by the local method .",
    "aid leads to the accumulation of somatic mutations in a large number of non immunoglobulin genes @xcite .",
    "a analysis for the presence of somatic hypermutations in 1,496,058 bp from activated b cells @xcite revealed a number of non - immunoglobulin genes with aid dependent mutations : _ il4ra _ , _ grap _ , _ hist1h1c _ , _ ly6e _ , _",
    "gadd45 g _ and _ il4i1_. three of these , namely _",
    "il4ra _ , _ grap _ and _ ly6e _ , were detected as genes with aid dependent hotspots by both methods , but a hotspot in _ hist1h1c _ ( mutation rate in _ ig@xmath117-aid _ _ _ ung__@xmath118 : 79.7 @xmath119 ) , was only found by ( table s2 and figure s3 ) .",

    "the functional categories associated with the scan statistic hotspots indicate that the top ranked genes are important in b lymphocytes .",
    "here we describe a method for the identification of chromosomal translocation hotspots .",
    "in contrast to the previous methods , the significance level for a cluster is defined on a chomosome - wide basis by using scan statistics .",
    "we show that this has important consequences in the analysis of translocation hotspots in primary b cells in the prescence or absence of 53bp1 repair protein .",
    "the previous study by @xcite showed that 53bp1 deficiency results in an increase of rearrangements to intergenic regions and changes the frequency and distribution of translocations in @xmath120 , @xmath121 immunoglobulin switch regions and other 16 prominent hotspots .",
    "our analysis adds to these findings by showing that the 53bp1 deficiency results in the overal enrichment of longer hotspots .",
    "these results support the previous conclusion that 53bp1 prevents the resection of dna thus resulting in shorter hotspots @xcite .",
    "our analysis here also shows that an increased amount of aid results in quite a substantial enlargement of pre - existing hotspot regions .",
    "these changes can only be observed with wider scanning windows , here @xmath122 , and are not detected by previous methods because of their local characterization of clustering .",
    "the success of the scan statistic here is brought by its ability to detect events spread across several scales as is shown by the analyses made with several scanning window widths .",
    "our analysis with the scan statistic is able to identify several exclusive hotspots whose authenticity is supported by independent experimental approaches .",
    "some of these exclusive events are localised in genes that are known to be relevant in tumorigenesis .",
    "the approach presented here may be applied to a variety of questions related to the detection of unusual clustering of a given pattern throughout the genome .",
    "few recent examples of particular interest are the detection of enriched genomic interaction regions such as those defined via chip - seq experiments @xcite , 4c - seq experiments @xcite and dna - dna contact sites @xcite .",

    "<S> * motivation : * the detection of genomic regions unusually rich in a given pattern is an important undertaking in the analysis of next generation sequencing data . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies of chromosomal translocations in activated b lymphocytes have identified regions that are frequently translocated to c - myc oncogene . </S>",
    "<S> a quantitative method for the identification of translocation hotspots was crucial to this study . </S>",
    "<S> here we improve this analysis by using a simple probabilistic model and the framework provided by scan statistics to define the number and location of translocation breakpoint hotspots . </S>",
    "<S> a key feature of our method is that it provides a global chromosome - wide significance level to clustering , as opposed to previous methods based on local criteria . </S>",
    "<S> whilst being motivated by a specific application , the detection of unusual clusters is a widespread problem in bioinformatics . </S>",
    "<S> we expect our method to be useful in the analysis of data from other experimental approaches such as of chip - seq and 4c - seq . </S>",
    "<S> + * results : * the analysis of translocations from b lymphocytes with the method described here reveals the presence of longer hotspots when compared to those defined previously . </S>",
    "<S> further , we show that the hotspot size changes quite substantially in the absence of dna repair protein 53bp1 . </S>",
    "<S> when 53bp1 deficiency is combined with overexpression of activation induced cytidine deaminase ( aid ) the hotspot length increases even further . </S>",
    "<S> these changes are not detected by previous methods that use local significance criteria for clustering . </S>",
    "<S> our method is also able to identify several exclusive translocation hotspots located in genes of known tumor supressors . </S>",
    "<S> + * availability : * the detection of translocation hotspots is done with , a program implemented in r and perl . </S>",
