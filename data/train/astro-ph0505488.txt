    "psr b0628@xmath028 is a bright radio pulsar ( large , vaughan & wielebinski , 1969 ) .",
    "its characteristic spin - down age is @xmath14 years .",
    "the pulsar s period and period derivative are @xmath15 s and @xmath16 , implying a spin - down luminosity of @xmath17 and a magnetic field at the neutron star poles of @xmath18 g. the distance to the pulsar as listed in the princeton pulsar catalog ( taylor , manchester & lyne 1993 ) and the atnf online pulsar database is 2.14 kpc ( taylor & cordes 1993 ; manchester et al .",
    "2005 ) . using the ne2001 galactic free electron density model of cordes & lazio ( 2002 ) which builds upon and supersedes the taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) model by exploiting",
    "new observations and methods , the radio dispersion measure of @xmath19 implies that the pulsar might be closer at a distance of only 1.45 kpc .",
    "the pulsar parameters and the emission properties observed in other x - ray detected rotation - powered pulsars ( cf .  becker & trmper 1997 ; becker & aschenbach 2002 and references therein ) , seem to indicate that psr b0628@xmath028  is an ordinary , old radio pulsar which is detectable just at the threshold of sensitivity of the current generation of x - ray observatories .",
    "the results from rosat and chandra observations , however , suggest that there might be more to expect from this pulsar .",
    "psr b0628@xmath028 was first noticed to have a faint potential x - ray counterpart in the rosat all - sky survey , rx j0630.8@xmath02834 ( becker et al .  1993 ) .",
    "the pulsar was therefore re - observed in october 1992 and april 1993 in two short pointed rosat observations of @xmath20 ksec and @xmath21 ksec exposures .",
    "both observations confirmed the detection of the x - ray source rx j0630.8@xmath02834 and collected 27 source counts from it in the rosat pspc ( position sensitive proportional counter ) .",
    "the low number of counts did not allow to obtain more than a rough hardness ratio which suggested that rx j0630.8@xmath02834 has a medium soft x - ray spectrum .",
    "a timing analysis was not possible either , thus leaving the association between rx j0630.8@xmath02834 and psr b0628@xmath028 an open issue and based on a rough positional agreement only .",
    "such an association , however , was regarded to be unlikely based on the estimated energy budget of the putative x - ray counterpart .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of rx j0630.8@xmath02834 extrapolated to the pulsar s distance was found to be @xmath22 of the pulsar spin - down energy .",
    "its x - ray conversion factor thus would be few hundred times higher than the average x - ray conversion factor @xmath23 which is observed in the @xmath7 kev band from other x - ray detected rotation - powered pulsars ( becker & trmper 1997 ) .    follow - up optical imaging and spectroscopic observations with the eso new technology telescope ( ntt ) in la silla ( chile ) were performed to assess the nature of the unidentified x - ray source rx j0630.8@xmath02834 .",
    "various optical sources were identified in the @xmath24 wide rosat pspc error box , which could not be conclusively ruled out as potential optical counterparts of rx j0630.8@xmath02834 .    recently , gelman and tepedelenlioglu ( 2002 ) have observed rx j0630.8@xmath02834 as part of the chandra - ao3 guest observer program .",
    "the source , cxc j063049.4@xmath0283443 , was clearly detected with the acis@xmath0s detector in an 17 ksec exposure in which 189 source counts were recorded from it .",
    "although representing an improvement over the rosat observations , the low number of source counts did not support a detailed spectral analysis which could discriminate between various possible spectral models .",
    "fixing the column absorption to a value corresponding to a neutral hydrogen density of @xmath25 ( as deduced from the pulsar s radio dispersion measure by assuming 10 h - atoms per free electron ) , both a power law model with photon - index @xmath26 and a thermal blackbody model with @xmath27 k and @xmath28 describe the energy spectrum of cxc j063049.4@xmath0283443 equally well . as the frame time of the acis - s in the selected mode",
    "was close to the pulsars rotation period , a timing analysis did not yield a significant result and prevented the derivation of reliable upper limits for the fraction of pulsed photons .",
    "however , the high spatial resolution of chandra along with its superior pointing accuracy allowed the determination of a much more accurate position of the putative x - ray counterpart rx j0630.8@xmath02834  than before .",
    "the chandra position of rx j0630.8 - 2834 was found to match the position of psr b0628@xmath028 by 1.5 arcsec !",
    "any offset from the pulsar radio position due to its proper motion ( brisken et al .",
    "2003 ) is well within the uncertainties of the chandra position .",
    "hence , the positional coincidence between rx j0630.8@xmath02834 ( cxc j063049.4@xmath0283443 resp . ) strongly suggests that this x - ray source is indeed the counterpart of psr b0628@xmath028 .",
    "in this paper we report on x - ray , optical and radio observations of psr b0628@xmath028 which were made with xmm - newton , the eso ntt in la silla and the lovell telescope at the jodrell bank observatory in order to explore the spectral and timing emission properties of this interesting pulsar .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner : in  2 we describe the optical , radio and xmm - newton observations of psr b0628@xmath028 and provide the details of the data processing and data filtering .",
    "the results of the spectral and timing analysis are given in  3 .",
    "a summary and concluding discussion is presented in  4 .",
    "two images of 600s exposure time in the b and v filters , pointed on the position of psr b0628@xmath028 , were made on dec .  15 , 1999 with the eso ntt multi - mode instrument ( emmi ) .",
    "the @xmath29 ( 422.3 nm ) image was taken with the blue arm , equipped with a tektronix @xmath30 chip having 24 @xmath31 pixels size ( 0.37 arcsec ) , while the @xmath32 ( 542.6 nm ) image was acquired with the red arm mounting a tektronix @xmath33 chip with 24 @xmath31 pixel size ( 0.27 arcsec ) .",
    "two images of the landolt field ru149 were observed soon after for the purpose of calibrating the two images .",
    "bias and flat - field were applied as usual , using calibration sets acquired at evening twilight , and the reduction of the images was performed with both daophot ( stetson 1987 ) and sextractor ( bertin and arnouts , 1996 ) to take into account the presence of extended sources and to check the output photometry results .",
    "photometric calibration was performed by using the ru149 field and the average la silla extinction terms ( -0.22 for b and -0.12 for v , as found in the instrument web - page at eso la silla site ) .",
    "the night was photometric and with a good seeing , 0.75 arcsec in v.    no source is detected at the position of psr b0628@xmath028 .",
    "figure [ optical_images ] shows a close - up view of the pulsar field as seen in the visible ( v ) and blue ( b ) bands .",
    "3@xmath34 upper limits assuming a point - source and correcting for the interstellar extinction are @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "values for e(b - v ) were derived from dust maps ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) . converting these upper limitspatton / astro / mags.htm ] to a photon flux upper limit yields @xmath37 for the v - band and @xmath38 for the b - band , respectively .",
    "the ephemerides for the analysis of the x - ray data were obtained from radio observations and the measurement of pulse times  of  arrival ( toas ) using the 76-m lovell radio telescope at jodrell bank observatory .",
    "table [ t : radio ] summarizes the radio ephemerides of psr b0628@xmath028 .",
    "a dual - channel cryogenic receiver system sensitive to two orthogonal polarizations was used predominantly at frequencies close to 1400 mhz .",
    "the signals of each polarization were mixed to an intermediate frequency , fed through a multi - channel filter - bank and digitized .",
    "the data were de - dispersed in hardware and folded on  line according to the pulsar s dispersion measure and topocentric period .",
    "the folded pulse profiles were stored for subsequent analysis . in a later off",
    " line processing step , every sub - integration spoiled by rfi was removed , the polarizations combined and the remaining sub - integrations averaged to produce a single total  intensity profile for the observation .",
    "toas were subsequently determined by convolving , in the time domain , the averaged profile with a template corresponding to the observing frequency .",
    "the uncertainty on the toa was found using the method described by downs & reichley ( 1983 ) , which incorporates the off  pulse rms noise and the ` sharpness ' of the template .",
    "these toas were corrected to the solar system barycenter using the jet propulsion laboratory de200 solar system ephemeris ( standish 1982 ) .",
    "more details can be found in hobbs et al .",
    "spectral data from psr b0628@xmath028 were obtained from the compilation of maron et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "the emission beam geometry of psr b0628@xmath028 is not known but can be estimated from fitting the canonical rotating vector model to the polarization position angle from radio data ( e.g.  lorimer & kramer 2005 ) .",
    "we used the polarization profiles observed at 408 mhz and 1400 mhz by gould & lyne ( 1998 , see reference for details about observing set - up and calibration procedure ) to determine the inclination of the magnetic axis to the rotation axis to be @xmath39 .",
    "the impact angle of the line of sight with the magnetic axis is fitted to be @xmath40 . as usual ,",
    "the small duty cycle of polarized emission available for modeling produces a distinct correlation between the fit results for @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we demonstrate this by showing the @xmath43-sphere for the 1400-mhz least - squares fit in @xmath41 and @xmath42 in figure [ polarisation ] .",
    "acceptable fits lie in the inside of the sickle shaped goodness of fit contours . at the higher frequency of 1400  mhz shown here ,",
    "the formal global minimum of the least - squares fit resides at the edge of the contours main body , in a small isolated point located at @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( cf .",
    "figure [ polarisation ] ) . in order to decide ,",
    "which solution in this rather large solution space is physically more acceptable , we can make use of the pulse shape information : the measured 50% width of the radio pulse amounts to @xmath46 . from studies of a large sample of radio pulsars ,",
    "one finds a relationship between the beam radius and the spin period ( see lorimer & kramer 2005 and references therein ) . based on such results , for a spin period of 1.244  s , one expects a beam width of @xmath47 for a line of sight cutting through the center of the emission cone ( i.e.  @xmath48 ) . an observed pulse width larger than this value may be a good indication of the possibility that the magnetic inclination angle is small , producing a path of the line - of - sight through the beam that is curved rather than straight .",
    "the fairly shallow gradient of the position angle curve may also add weight to this small-@xmath41 solution , but a combination of the @xmath43-contours obtained for 408  mhz and 1400  mhz makes a nearly orthogonal solution @xmath49 the most likely one . a sketch which illustrates possible beam geometries",

    "we used the epic - pn camera as the prime instrument and operated both mos1/2 cameras in primefullwindow mode to obtain imaging and spectral data .",
    "the epic - pn camera was setup to operate in primelargewindow readout mode which provides imaging , spectral and timing information with a temporal resolution of 48 ms .",
    "the higher temporal resolution of the epic - pn small - window mode would have been attractive but an overkill in view of its @xmath52 higher dead - time ( see e.g.  becker & aschenbach 2002 for a summary of xmm - newton instrument modes suitable for pulsar studies ) .",
    "the medium filter was used for the mos1/2 cameras and the thin filter for the epic - pn .",
    "the expected lower efficiency of the rgs means that it is of limited use for the given exposure time .",
    "the optical field is well known from our ntt / emmi observations so that we do not report on the analysis of xmm s optical monitor ( om ) data .",

    "a summary of exposure times , instrument modes and filters used for the x - ray observation is given in table  [ t : xray_obs ] .",
    "xmm - newton data have been seen to show timing discontinuities in the photon arrival times with positive and negative jumps of the order of one to several seconds ( becker & aschenbach 2002 ; kirsch et al .",
    "2003 ) . inspecting the log - files from our processing of raw data we found that the epic - pn data of psr b0628@xmath028 exhibit a clock discontinuity showing one negative jump of 15s .",
    "we therefore used a release track version of the xmm - newton sas ( standard analysis software ) for the analysis of the epic - pn data .",
    "this software detects and corrects most of the timing discontinuities during data processing .",
    "in addition , known timing offsets due to ground station and space craft clock propagation delays are corrected by this software in using new reconstructed time correlation ( tcx ) data .",
    "barycenter correction of the epic - pn data and all other analysis steps were performed by using sas version 6.1 .",
    "data screening for times of high background was done by inspecting the light - curves of the mos1/2 and pn data at energies above 10 kev .",
    "apart from having a rather high sky background contribution , strong x - ray emission from soft proton flares are seen at various times during the observation . creating the light - curves with bins of 100s",
    ", we rejected those bins where the mos1/2 light - curves had more than 130 cts / bin .",
    "for the epic - pn data we rejected times with more than 90 cts / bin ( for comparison , data with a typical low sky background require the rejection of events at a level of @xmath53 cts / bin ) . the data screening reduced the effective exposure time for the mos1/2 to 35.6 ksec and 34.6 ksec , respectively .",
    "for the epic - pn data the effective exposure time was reduced to 31.7 ksec .",
    "the net exposure time after rejecting times of high sky background thus is only about 74% of the requested observing time .    for the spectral analysis based on the mos1/2 data we used only those events with a detection _",

    "the fraction of pulsed events in the @xmath55 kev energy range is determined to be of @xmath74 by using a bootstrap method ( swanepoel , de beer & loots 1996 ; becker & trmper 1999 ) .",
    "restricting the timing analysis to the @xmath75 kev and @xmath76 kev energy bands yields the pulsed fractions @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively , which do not indicate a significant energy dependence over the @xmath55 kev bandpass , although the decreasing signal to noise ratio beyond @xmath79 kev makes any conclusion for this energy band merely tentative .    comparing the x - ray pulse profile with the one taken with the jodrell bank radio telescope at 1.4",
    "ghz shows that both profiles are markedly different .",
    "measuring the toas of the radio and x - ray pulses shows that the narrow x - ray pulse leads the radio pulse by @xmath80 ( @xmath81 longitude ) in phase .",
    "the radio pulse itself leads the broader x - ray pulse by about the same amount of @xmath81 longitude .",
    "the arrival of the radio pulse thus appears to be in the middle between the arrival of the two x - ray pulse components .",

    "the flux density in the radio part of the spectrum , which is supposed to be due to coherent radiation , is several orders of magnitude greater than the extrapolated optical or x - ray flux densities .    extrapolating the power law spectrum which describes the xmm - newton data to the optical v- and b - bands yields a photon flux which exceeds the measured upper limits by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "this suggest that the broadband spectrum , if entirely non - thermal , has to break somewhere before or in the soft channels of the x - ray spectrum . to test this hypothesis",
    "we have fitted a broken power law model to the xmm - newton data and found it providing a better description ( @xmath43= 27.576 for 37 dof ) of the observed x - ray spectrum than the single power law model does . a broken power law model which is in agreement with the optical v- and b - band upper limits and the xmm - newton data has its break point fitted at @xmath125 .",

    "its x - ray pulse profile is characterized by a single broad peak and a second narrow pulse component which leads the main pulse by @xmath133 .",
    "a comparison of the pulse profiles observed in the @xmath55 kev band and at 1.4 ghz shows that the x - ray pulse profile is markedly different from the single narrow peaked profile observed in the radio band .",

    ", the x - ray emission from these old pulsars seems to be dominated by non - thermal radiation processes .",
    "none of the observed spectra _ required _ adding a thermal component consisting of either a hot polar cap or surface cooling emission to model the data .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of psr b0950 + 08 is best described by a single power law of photon - index @xmath137 .",
    "its x - ray emission is pulsed with two peaks per period and a phase separation of @xmath133 between the two pulse components .",
    "its pulsed fraction is @xmath138 in the @xmath55 kev band .",
    "the spectral and temporal emission properties observed from psr b1929 + 10 and psr b0823 + 26 are very similar to those seen in psr b0950 + 08 and psr b0628@xmath028(becker et al .",
    "their energy spectra can be adequately described by a single power law with photon - index @xmath139 and @xmath140 , respectively .",
    "fitting combined planckian plus power law models to the observed spectral data from these pulsars , however , is possible as well and indicates thermal contributions from heated polar caps to the soft x - ray bands of the order of @xmath141 according to the best fitting model spectra .",
    "the fraction of pulsed photons for all these pulsars are in the range of @xmath142 .",
    "the similarity in the emission properties to other x - ray detected pulsars from the same class does not support the assumption that there is anything special in the emission properties of psr b0628@xmath028 which justifies the high spin - down to x - ray energy conversion . the spin - down to x - ray energy conversion efficiency for the sample of rosat",
    "detected rotation - powered pulsars was investigated by becker & trmper ( 1997 ) who described the available data with the relation @xmath143 .",
    "this relation is corrected for possible thermal contributions e.g.  in cooling neutron stars and was found to fit the data within the @xmath7 kev band assuming isotropy . arguing that the @xmath144 kev energy band should be better suited for this study because any thermal contribution and spectral fitting uncertainties from interstellar absorption is minimized , possenti et al .",
    "( 2002 ) performed a similar analysis using rosat , asca and bepposax data of a somewhat larger sample than was available before . for faint sources like the old and nearby radio pulsars and most millisecond pulsars , possenti et al .",
    "( 2002 ) obtained the flux in the @xmath144 kev band by simply upscaling the rosat results from becker & trmper(1997 ) .",
    "those results , however , are not very meaningful , especially if there is no spectral information available and a simple counts - to - energy conversion requires the assumption of a spectral shape , as it was the case for the sample of old non - recycled pulsars . here , psr b1929 + 10 was taken as a prototype and x - ray fluxes were obtained by assuming that the x - ray emission from old pulsars originates entirely from heated polar caps .",
    "our new spectral results obtained for psr b0628@xmath028 and for the other old rotation - powered pulsars in recently xmm - newton observations ( cf .",
    "becker et al .  2004 ; 2005 ) , however , shows that this assumption is no longer valid .",
    "consequently , we do not follow their conclusions e.g.  of maximum x - ray emissivity but assume that the conversion efficiency @xmath145 for psr b0628@xmath028 within @xmath7 kev is in the same range of @xmath146 than observed by becker et al .",
    "( 2004 ; 2005 ) in psr b1929 + 10 ( @xmath147 ) , b0950 + 08 ( @xmath148 ) , b0823 + 26 ( @xmath149 ) , and j2043 + 2740 ( @xmath150 ) using xmm - newton .",
    "we are therefore in favor of the interpretation that in @xmath151 the distance of 1.45 kpc , based on the radio dispersion measure and the galactic free electron density model ne2001 ( cordes & lazio 2002 ) , is overestimated .",
    "if we take the errors in the x - ray flux measured from psr b0628@xmath028 into account , we obtain a pulsar distance @xmath152 which is about 5 to 22 times closer than the radio dispersion measure inferred distance .",
    "distance_scales ] summarizes the scaling parameters which were computed for the measured soft x - ray flux but with assumed spin - down conversion efficiencies .",
    "distances based on the ne2001 galactic free electron density model are estimated to be , on average , correct within a factor of @xmath153 . however , as the galactic free electron distribution is seen to vary significantly on small and large scales by more than two orders of magnitude it might not be excluded that for single pulsars the model can over- or underestimate the free electron density and thus yields a wrong distance estimate .",
    "although it is difficult to imagine that the model predicted distance is off by a factor 10 to 20 , a factor of @xmath154 might not be excluded in rare cases .",
    "for example , for a pulsar distance of 300pc the ne2001 model predicts a dispersion measure @xmath155 of @xmath156 .",
    "if compared with the measured value of @xmath157 this means that any extra unmodeled material along the line of sight to psr b0628@xmath028 would need to contribute a radio dispersion measure of @xmath158 .",
    "this correction would not necessarily be due to an unmodeled h - ii region ( typically @xmath159 ) but would be only slightly higher than , but still comparable to the typical `` clump '' added in the ne2001 model for discrepant lines of sight , e.g.  towards psr j1031 - 6117 , psr j1119 - 6127 , and psr j1128 - 6219 ( cordes & lazio 2003 ) . although these `` clumps '' in the ne2001 model do not necessarily represent physical objects , we did inspect the digitized sky survey images and the images from our eso / ntt observations to see whether they show any evidence of enhanced diffuse emission near to the region of psr b0628@xmath028 .",
    "no noticeable source was recognized that could account for this extra correction . inspecting the southern h - alpha sky survey atlas ( gaustad et al .",
    "2001 ) revealed some indications on a larger scale of @xmath160 for a h - ii region to the north of psr b0628@xmath028 , but it is unlikely that this could affect the distance estimate by a factor of 5 to 10 or even more ( j.lazio priv",
    ".  com . ) .",
    "one way to evaluate a possible range of distances is by comparing the transverse velocity , derived from the measured proper motion and an assumed distance , to typical pulsar velocities .",
    "for instance , for the 1.45 kpc inferred from ne2001 , the proper motion measurement of 48.7 mas yr@xmath89 ( hobbs et al .",
    "2004 ) translates into a transverse speed of 335 km s@xmath89 which compares to a mean 2-d speed as found for a large sample of pulsars of @xmath161 km s@xmath162 ( hobbs et al .",
    "for the larger distance of 2.15 kpc derived using the taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) model , the velocity increases to a rather large but still plausible value of 497 km s@xmath89 . if the pulsar were a factor of 5 or 22 closer , than the transverse speed drops to 67 km s@xmath89 and 15 km s@xmath89 , respectively .",
    "unless the non - measurable radial speed happens to be large , the latter velocity is extremely small and quite unlikely .",
    "although the distance of the pulsar might be the most obvious parameter which may lead to a too high x - ray conversion efficiency , there might be others .",
    "the conversion efficiency here and in becker & trmper ( 1997 ) is for isotropy .",
    "would it be possible that the pulsar has an atypically small beaming angle ? or that it could be a coaction of several effects like beaming , distance , peculiarities of its magnetosphere which cause the apparent higher x - ray efficiency ?",
    "so far psr b0628@xmath028 was not included in any radio parallax measurement program .",
    "the pulsar s radio emission is strong enough so that a radio parallax could be measured with the vlba .",
    "this will be done on a time scale of about two years and will provide us with the missing information on whether it is `` simply '' the pulsar distance which causes the inferred huge x - ray conversion or whether psr b0628@xmath028 bears more interesting things to discover .",
