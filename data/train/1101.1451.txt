    "double or multiple galaxy clusters can potentially provide information on the dynamics and structure formation on ( @xmath5 1 mpc ) scales and interest in them has grown from both the standpoints of modelling and observation .",
    "although the presence of substructure in galaxy clusters has long been known , compared to single galaxy clusters , the properties of double and multiple clusters have received less attention owing to their added complexity .",
    "interest in the observed substructure of galaxy clusters was pioneered by , geller & beers ( 1982 ) and studies employing the radial infall model ( beers , geller & huchra 1982 ; beers 1991 ) was used for rough dynamical estimates .    with the realization of their importance , a growing number of systems",

    "these simulations have mostly focused on the behavior of the baryonic and dark matter components and use a range of initial profiles and conditions and impact parameters which include both off - centre and head - on collsions .",

    "several authors have attempted to extract information from double and multiple galaxy clusters on the nature of gravity and dark matter on galactic cluster ( @xmath6 1 mpc ) distance scales and up to now this has mainly centred on analyzing the 1e0657 - 56 cluster .",

    "shan ( 2010 ) have studied further offsets between dark and ordinary matter in a further 38 lensed galaxy clusters .",
    "galaxy clusters have been employed to place limits on neutrino masses ( tremaine & gunn 1979 ; angus , famaey , & diaferio 2010 ; natarajan & zhao 2008 ) and discussed whether or not such particle masses are needed to save the modified newtonian dynamics formula .    even if one dismisses such claims , a considerable amount of more conventional information is obtainable from double galaxy clusters .",
    "this includes possible modifications to luminosity functions , mass profiles and velocity dispersion anisotropy measures ( the @xmath4 parameter ) as a result of their interactions .",
    "luminosity functions contain information on the galaxy formation history ( bingelli , sandage & tammann 1988 ) and have been studied in detail at a range of redshifts and environments , mostly for single systems ( wilson 1997 ; de propis 2004 ; blanton 2003 ; christlein & zabludoff 2003 ; goto 2005 ) .",

    "in addition , for a spherical system with the nfw profile , the anisotropy parameter @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 is the azimuthal velocity dispersion and @xmath11 the radial velocity dispersion ) , is predicted to be near 0 at the centre and to increase to about 0.3 beyond the virial radius and can provide information on the properties of the dark matter ( host 2009 ) .    many of the systems described in the literature are multiple and complex or minor mergers where the mass of one component is considerably larger than the other.the abell 2465 double cluster discussed in this paper has a relatively uncomplicated substructure and shows some evidence for either a past collision or a commencing merger between the two components .",

    "viewing figure  [ cluster.eps ] , this rise should result from the bright bcg complex near the centre of the sw clump .",
    "consequently , a more complicated composite profile containing a bright core yields a better fit . however , which combination of profiles is the best is difficult to decide with the present data .",
    "one possibility shown in figure  [ doubleprof.eps ] is to add two nfw profiles , one with @xmath7 = 120 which gives a sharp core and the other with @xmath7 = 1.0 which produces an extended outer region .",

    "( 1 ) head - on and off - centre simulations generally merge soon after their second crossing , indicating that the two subclusters in abell 2465 have collided at most once or are merging for the first time .",
    "( 2 ) the gas components temperatures spike when the two centres cross and cool rapidly . following ritchie & thomas ( 2002 ) , the collision of @xmath116m@xmath117 equal masses , close to that estimated for abell 2465 , the gas temperature reaches @xmath118 kev and cools to @xmath119 kev in about 3 to 4 gyr as the clumps separate to apocentre and begin reconverging .",
    "the temperatures of  3.3 , are consistent with this time scale if the cluster is in the post - impact stage , but can not be used to prove the physical state of the merger .",
    "( 3 ) the collision produces an expanding impact disk of gas as two clusters pass through each other which breaks into two sections continuing outward with the main masses .",
    "zu hone , lamb , & ricker ( 2009 ) have discussed ring formation .",
    "the dark matter components pass through each other and the core regions are not disrupted .",
    "tormen ( 2004 ) analysed the evolution of merging galaxy cluster satellites from hydrodynamical n - body simulations including dark matter and baryonic gas .",
    "they fitted the statistics of collisions including orbital properties , velocity dispersions , gas temperatures , etc . as a function of the satellite and main cluster pre - merger mass ratio , @xmath120 . for @xmath121 ,",
    "@xmath122 gyr is required to reach apocentre . consequently , this and the temperature aging indicate that the time since the collision is of order @xmath123 2 - 4 gyr .",
    "the cluster light profiles and luminosity functions provide additional clues to the interaction of the two components of abell 2465 .",
    "the sw clump has a sharper core in both the visual and x - rays as well as more faint galaxies shown in figures  [ histo_c ] and [ contours ] .",
    "the two well studied cluster collisions involving recent impacts , 1e0657 - 56 and abell 2146 ( clowe 2006 ; russell 2010 ) , have lower mass ratios of @xmath124 and 0.3 respectively .",
    "both exhibit a relatively dense ` bullet ' emerging from a more extended ` target , ' and are near their pericentres , having collided @xmath125 gyr ago , compared to @xmath126 gyr for the cooler abell 2465 now near apocentre . by analogy with these two objects ,",
    "one identifies the sw clump with its sharper optical and x - ray core as the bullet and the more extended ne clump as the target .",
    "the presence of the 1.4 ghz radio source and its higher mass further imply that the ne clump is the primary .",
    "although cluster cores are not disrupted , the outer regions can be modified .",
    "the published simulations show complex behavior of the collisionless component .",
    "bekki ( 1999 ) and roettiger , burns , & loken ( 1993 ) demonstrate that the distribution of dark matter in the secondary expands after the collision . using the simple impact approximation ( binney & tremaine 2008 ) , energy changes accompanied by mass loss of the impacting systems occur .",
    "intuitively one expects core regions to contract as they meet while the outer layers of the clusters expand ( aguilar & white 1985 ; funato & makino 1999 ) . some of the off - centre models ( poole 2006 ; ricker & sarazin 2001 ) show that when the secondary core reaches apocentre and turns around , there can be a significant displacement of the cluster s outer region which is assisted by a gravitational slingshot similar to a trailing tidal trail .",
    "thus the sw clump might be expected to be surrounded by more debris than the ne which accounts for its excess of faint galaxies .",
    "previous investigations have found inconclusive results for different cluster pairs regarding star formation .",
    "hwang & lee ( 2009 ) found enhanced star formation activity between the subclusters of abell 168 which they concluded had passed through each other and none in abell 1750 which may be in an early stage of merging .",
    "rawle ( 2010 ) have found significant star formation in the bullet cluster using herschel .",
    "caldwell & rose ( 1997 ) reported enhanced star forming in interacting clusters as did cortese ( 2004 ) for abell 1367 , ferrari ( 2005 ) for abell 3921 , and johnston - hollitt ( 2008 ) for abell 3125/28 , but tomita ( 1996 ) and de propis ( 2004 ) found no correlation for blue galaxies and mergers .",
    "ma ( 2010 ) have described macsj0025.4 - 1225 , which has several features in common with abell 2465 , as a post - major - merger .",
    "they find enhanced numbers of starforming galaxies which they interpret to have been produced by the merger .",
    "the emission line galaxies in abell 2465 , however , lends weight to the hypothesis that cluster mergers enhance star formation .",
    "it has always been difficult to pin down the process or combination of processes leading to star formation in galaxies .",
    "bekki ( 1999 ) found that the time - dependent tidal gravitational field is an important effect that can trigger starburst galaxies in mergers .",
    "martig & bournaud ( 2008 ) also find that tidal fields in merging dense cosmological structures and the outskirts of galaxy clusters can induce star formation .",
    "the presence of apparently distorted star forming galaxies with no detected companions in the clusters could be consistent with this mechanism .",
    "spectroscopic and photometric observations of the double galaxy cluster abell 2465 are presented .",
    "there are five main conclusions that can be drawn .",
    "\\1 . concerning the cluster dynamics ,",
    "the virial masses of the two subclusters are found from fuzzy clustering , which is used to estimate the probability of a galaxy s membership in each clump , with the result that @xmath127 for the ne member and @xmath128 for the sw member and the virial radii are @xmath129 mpc and @xmath130 mpc for ne and sw respectively .",
    "the masses compare well with those from x - ray scaling relations that also give temperatures of 4.1 @xmath131 and 3.75 @xmath132 kev respectively .",
    "the velocity difference between the two subclusters is found to be @xmath133 = 205 @xmath3 149 which confirms that they are related .",
    "measurement of the clusters velocity dispersions with radius assuming spherical symmetry indicate that the anisotropy parameter , @xmath4 , is low .",
    "there is an excess of star forming galaxies showing emission lines . of cluster members observed spectroscopically in figure  [ diagnostic.eps ] , 37% have detectable h@xmath134 emission .",
    "these have the properties of star forming galaxies .",
    "there are more emission line objects in the sw clump than in the ne clump and there appears to be more emission line galaxies than non - emission between the two clumps .",
    "this does not seem to be explained by a selection bias .",
    "there is no evidence for strong agn activity in abell 2465 .",
    "this number of emission line objects between the clump centres is unusual when compared to single galaxy clusters .",
    "the @xmath16 and @xmath14 magnitudes show well defined red sequences in each subcluster .",
    "the luminosity functions determined within the central 0.6 mpc of each clump indicate a normal mixture of galactic types . however , the sw region has more galaxies fainter than @xmath135 than its ne companion .",
    "this could result from their collision or otherwise would suggest different formation histories .",
    "the possibility of a background cluster needs to be further checked .",
    "the light profiles of both components measured as growth curves were fitted using nfw profiles .",
    "the ne clump is fit with a somewhat high concentration parameter @xmath136 , although this depends on the adopted virial radius .",
    "the sw clump is fit rather badly with @xmath137 and needs a profile with a more compact core .",
    "a better fit is a sharp core ( @xmath7 = 120 ) surrounded by an extended outer region ( @xmath7 = 1.0 ) .",
    "this is consistent with figure  [ xmmnvss ] and published rosat data showing that the x - ray core radii differ with @xmath138 of ne being about three times larger than that of the sw and indicates that sw has a cooling core . the derived @xmath20-band mass to light ratios are @xmath139 and @xmath140 which puts them in the normal range for galaxy clusters .    \\5 .",
    "a consistent picture of the collision of the abell 2465 components is discussed .",
    "it is possible that the pair collided 2 - 4 gyr ago and are now near maximum separation .",
    "the small displacements of the dark matter and baryonic matter as judged by the x - ray data and distribution of the galaxies is consistent with their re - merging after the collision , the high percentage of emission line galaxies in the spectroscopic sample may be a consequence of the collision and are the strongest argument for a past interaction , but this might also be the case if the merger is just starting and interaction occurs along the interface between the two clusters .",
    "more models that include the dynamics of the galaxies would be helpful .",
    "a weak lensing study of the two components of abell 2465 is under way .",
    "many of the galaxy spectra were obtained through the service observing programme of anglo - australian observatory and i wish to express my gratitude .",
    "the imaging observations used in this paper were based on observations obtained with megaprime / megacam , a joint project of cfht and cea / dapnia , at the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) which is operated by the national research council ( nrc ) of canada , the institut national des science de lunivers of the centre national de la recherche scientifique ( cnrs ) of france , and the university of hawaii .",
    "this work is based in part on data products produced at terapix and the canadian astronomy data centre as part of the canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey , a collaborative project of nrc and cnrs .",
    "i thank the canadian tac for granting the time and the qso team for obtaining the imaging data .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",

    "<S> optical imaging and spectroscopic observations of the @xmath0 double galaxy cluster abell 2465 are described . </S>",
    "<S> this object appears to be undergoing a major merger . </S>",
    "<S> it is a double x - ray source and is detected in the radio at 1.4 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this paper is to investigate signatures of the interaction of the two components . </S>",
    "<S> redshifts were measured to determine velocity dispersions and virial radii of each component . </S>",
    "<S> the technique of fuzzy clustering was used to assign membership weights to the galaxies in each clump . </S>",
    "<S> using redshifts of 93 cluster members within 1.4 mpc of the subcluster centres , the virial mass of the ne component is @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the sw . </S>",
    "<S> these agree within the errors with masses from x - ray scaling relations . </S>",
    "<S> the projected velocity difference between the two subclusters is 205 @xmath3 149 . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy parameter , @xmath4 , is found to be low for both components . </S>",
    "<S> spectra of 37% of the spectroscopically observed galaxies show emission lines and are predominantly star forming in the diagnostic diagram . </S>",
    "<S> no strong agn sources were found . </S>",
    "<S> the emission line galaxies tend to lie between the two cluster centres with more near the sw clump . </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity functions of the two subclusters differ . </S>",
    "<S> the ne component is similar to many rich clusters , while the sw component has more faint galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the ne clump s light profile follows a single nfw profile with c = 10 while the sw is better fit with an extended outer region and a compact inner core , consistent with available x - ray data indicating that the sw clump has a cooling core . </S>",
    "<S> the observed differences and properties of the two components of abell 2465 are interpreted to have been caused by a collision 2 - 4 gyr ago , after which they have moved apart and are now near their apocentres , although the start of a merger remains a possibility . </S>",
    "<S> the number of emission line galaxies gives weight to the idea that galaxy cluster collisions trigger star formation .    </S>",
