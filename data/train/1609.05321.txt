    "while rigid body dynamics under mechanical stress is well studied in classical mechanics and engineering @xcite , similar considerations in the context of biopolymers began in earnest only recently with the advent of single molecule ( sm ) techniques .",
    "these methods are now routinely used to manipulate the biopolymers @xcite .",
    "the renewed interest in the semiflexible chain @xcite is partly due to the stretching experiments on dsdna and multidomain proteins whose force - extension curves are well characterized by the worm - like chain model @xcite .",
    "sm manipulation techniques using the atomic force microscopy ( afm ) and laser optical tweezers ( lot ) have yielded great insights into the elasticity of nucleic acids as well as quantitive glimpses into the folding landscapes of proteins and rna and their complexes . in particular , the use of mechanical force provides a viable means to measure and decipher the underlying characteristics of the free energy landscape , such as the position of transition state , ruggedness , and the height of free energy barrier @xcite , and the extent of dynamic / static disorder in the pulled molecules @xcite .",
    "quantitative understandings into structure and energetics of dna @xcite , rna @xcite , and proteins @xcite , which are difficult to decipher using conventional ensemble experiments , have become available by decoding the origin of molecular responses under tension .",
    "thanks to major advances in sm force measurement , developments in theories , computations , and experiments have cross - fertilized to produce comprehensive understanding of biomolecules on nanometer scales .",
    "in particular , steered molecular dynamics simulations pioneered by schulten and coworkers made a major contribution to the field at the early stage of the development @xcite .",
    "these studies , which have become the standard tool for experimentalists , have been used to visualize the sequence of unfolding events that might occur during the unraveling of proteins under tension at atomic resolution .",
    "however , the time scale gap between the computational approach using atomically detailed model and experiment has not been resolved despite progress in computer technologies . in a practically limited computation time , large forces and loading rates ( or pulling speeds ) are typically used to accelerate the unbinding or unfolding processes .",
    "it is likely that the use of artificially large forces inevitably alters the unfolding pathways from those elucidated from force experiments @xcite .",
    "the currently accessible time scale accessible in atomistic detailed simulations is @xmath0 ms @xcite .",
    "this restrains the minimum loading rate that can be reached by computer simulation to at best @xmath1 pn / s if one were to study the forced unfolding of a simple rna hairpin , which reversibly unfolds and folds at @xmath2 pn at @xmath3 pn / s @xcite .",
    "this is four orders of magnitude faster than the experimental loading rate @xmath4 pn / s used in lot .",
    "the force ramped at rates faster than the relaxation process of the molecules confines their conformations to a narrow phase space .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to explore alternate computational approaches to probe forced - unfolding .",
    "a decade ago , in an effort to study forced - unfolding dynamics of rna and proteins at time scales compatible to those in force measurements , we proposed a new class of minimal coarse - grained models , called the self - organized ( sop ) polymer model @xcite .",
    "the premise underlying the creation of the sop model is that unfolding pathways of biomolecule is mainly determined by the overall network of inter - residue interactions in the native state , which are disrupted stochastically under a given perturbation , and the chain connectivity along the polymer backbone .",
    "the sop model allowed us to simulate small - to - medium sized biomolecules at loading rates comparable to the real experiments @xcite .",
    "in the process , we demonstrated that the unfolding pathways of biomolecule are explicitly dependent on the pulling speed @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we revealed that the unfolding pathways of gfp bifurcate into two alternative pathways ( opening of gfp barrel from either n- or c- terminus ) , which was difficult to capture by analyzing force - extension curves from afm pulling experiments alone @xcite .",
    "these predictions were not only unanticipated in experiments but are difficult to predict using standard molecular dynamics simulations .    the gaussian network model ( gnm ) @xcite ( or elastic network model ( enm ) @xcite ) , used to describe conformational fluctuations and intra - molecular allosteric communications of biomolecules in the native states @xcite , provides an alternative way to predict the force - induced rupture of rna and proteins .",
    "conformational fluctuations of proteins in their native state is faithfully described by low - frequency normal modes @xcite , which can be captured by using the topological information in the native contact maps .",
    "the low frequency modes remain insensitive to the details of interaction , such as strength and nature of interactions ( vdw , h - bond , electrostatic ) .",
    "this observation justifies the use of coarse - grained representations of molecular systems for simulating at large length and time scales .",
    "indeed , gnm is excellent in reproducing the relative amplitude of residue fluctuation , which is often compared with debye - waller factor .    here",
    ", adapting the study of srivastava and graneck , who considered thermal and force - induced unfolding of proteins by extending the formalism of gnm @xcite , we explore force - induced rupture of rna molecules . in the framework of gnm",
    ", the dynamic cross - correlation between residue fluctuations at finite temperature is related to the inverse kirchhoff matrix , containing information on network connectivity .",
    "the response of the system under force is related to squared inverse kirchhoff matrix .",
    "mechanical force can , in principle , be applied to any site in the structure , revealing the allosteric communication spread throughout the structure .",
    "in addition , the force - induced unfolding experiment is mimicked by applying forces on the two ends ( or two distinct sites ) .",
    "increasing forces induces a large fluctuation in the non - covalently bonded residue pairs ( @xmath5 ) and disrupts them , which can be implemented by modifying the connectivity matrix at each value of the applied force .",
    "we show that gnm using topological information alone can satisfactorily unveil the forced - unfolding pathway of rna molecule at equilibrium .",
    "* gaussian network model under force : * one of the aims of using gnm @xcite is to elucidate the natural conformational dynamics arising solely from the native state contact map .",
    "the reasonable agreement between theoretically computed mean square fluctuation ( msf ) and the crystallographic b - factor suggests that residue - specific interactions are of secondary importance in characterizing the dynamics of a biomolecule in the native state @xcite .",
    "this is further substantiated by a number of studies that show fluctuations and correlated motions of the native conformation are satisfactorily described solely using the information on native contacts .    in gnm ,",
    "vectors linking residue pairs in contact ( @xmath6 ) relative to those in the native state @xmath7 are harmonically restrained to have the following form , @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the list of residue pairs in contact satisfying the geometrical condition @xmath10 in the native state .",

    "an optimum choice of cut - off distance @xmath32 , which minimizes the difference between the temperature factor and self - correlation is expected . for rna , when the center of mass in each nucleotide is set to be the position of each nucleotide , @xmath33   reproduces reasonable results for b - factor with @xmath34 pn@xmath35nm / @xmath36 .",

    "we showed that the force response of rna in the native state can be well described with gnm which incorporated the 3d topology of the molecule in terms of kirchhoff matrix .",
    "importantly , the pattern of cross - correlation over the molecular architecture under mechanical perturbation differs from the thermal cross - correlation ( fig.[fig : tij ] ) and also shows a large variation depending on where the force is applied ( fig.[fig : perturbation ] , si movie ) .",
    "the accuracy of our prediction on dynamical cross - correlation ( @xmath47 ) which is used to capture the essence of conformational dynamics is expected to increase with the growing system size ( @xmath55 ) because main contributions to the value of @xmath47 come from low frequency modes .",

    "finally , given the simplicity of the model , the extent of agreement of the predicted unfolding pathways from gnm with those identified by sm force measurement is surprising .",
    "we note that simulation of forced - unfolding process at the experimentally meaningful pulling speed using even the minimal sop model is time - consuming for large rna molecules .",
