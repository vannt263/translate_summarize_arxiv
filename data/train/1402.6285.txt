    "semiclassical gravity , in which the renormalized expectation value of a matter stress tensor operator is the source of a classical gravitational field , reproduces all of the phenomena of classical general relativity .",
    "the effects of classical gravitational fields upon the propagation of light rays include gravitational lensing and the shapiro time delay  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , these are the effects of gravitational fields produced by matter which satisfies classical energy conditions , such as the null energy condition , @xmath0 for all null vectors @xmath1",
    ". however , semiclassical gravity also describes the gravitational effects of matter which violates this condition , as may occur when negative energy density is present .",
    "if the classical conditions are violated , then defocussing and time advance effects are possible .",
    "the simplest example would be a negative mass schwarzschild geometry , which would act as a diverging lens and exhibit a shapiro time advance .",
    "the connection between exotic matter and superluminal propagation has been discussed by several authors  @xcite , who show that violation of the null energy condition is required to have a time advance , a light ray traveling faster than it would in flat spacetime .",
    "quantum field theory does allow local negative energy densities , as in the casimir effect or in squeezed states , but these effects are very restricted in either space or time . in the case of the casimir effect with parallel perfect plane mirrors at a separation of @xmath2 , there is a uniform static negative energy density between the mirrors of @xmath3 .",
    "in the case of more realistic mirrors , it is possible still to have a reduced negative energy density  @xcite . in the case of nonclassical quantum states , such as squeezed vacua ,",
    "the negative energy is limited in its temporal duration by quantum inequalities  @xcite .",
    "these inequalities give an inverse relation between the magnitude and duration of negative energy in the frame of any inertial observer , and greatly limit the gravitational effects of negative energy density .",
    "however , the quantum inequalities do not mean that negative energy density , or related subvacuum effects , are unobservable .",
    "subvacuum effects can produce changes in the magnetization of a spin system  @xcite and the rate of atomic decays  @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we will discuss another possibility , the effects of negative mean squared electric field upon the propagation of light in a nonlinear material .",
    "the basic idea is that in a material with nonzero third order susceptibility , the speed of propagation of a probe pulse can depend upon the squared electric field , which can be produced by a background field .",
    "this effect is an analog model for the effects of gravity on light propagation .",
    "if the mean squared electric field is positive , @xmath4 , then there is an increase in the index of refraction and hence a decrease in the speed of the probe pulse .",
    "this is analogous to the effect of the gravitational field of normal matter on light rays .",
    "however , @xmath5 is defined as a difference between values in a given state and in the vacuum , and hence need not be positive . if @xmath6 , we have a subvacuum effect , and there is an increase in the speed of the probe pulse .",
    "this is analogous to the gravitational effects of exotic matter .",
    "the subvacuum effect can be created by a background field in a squeezed state .",
    "a similar model was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to model light cone fluctuations .",
    "however , that model used materials with nonzero second order susceptibility and described fluctuations in propagation speed around an average value which was independent of the background field . in the present paper",

    "@xmath18 here repeated indices are summed over .",
    "we will consider the case in which @xmath14 and @xmath10 are parallel .",
    "then the electric field is divergenceless and its evolution is governed by the wave equation , @xmath19 we will further consider only the case where the second order susceptibility vanishes , so @xmath20 , as will hold for any material whose crystal lattice possess spatial inversion symmetry . if we stop the expansion in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pol ] ) at third order , then eq .  ( [ eq : wave - eq ] ) contains linear and cubic terms in the electric field .",

    "we can greatly simplify our model by taking both fields to be linearly polarized in the @xmath26-direction , so @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in this case , the only coefficients of the susceptibility tensors that contribute to the wave propagation are @xmath29 and @xmath30 , which we will denote as @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "we may work to linear order in the probe field and write its wave equation as @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the effective speed of light in the medium when only linear effects take place ( i.e. , when @xmath35 ) , @xmath36 and @xmath37    the effect of the background field is to cause the probe field to experience an effective index of refraction which depends upon space and time .",
    "this effect upon the propagation of probe pulses is analogous to the effects of a gravitational field upon light propagation .",
    "because the wavelength of the probe field is short compared to the scale of variation of @xmath38 , we may use a geometric optics treatment with a local refractive index defined as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the velocity of the probe field and can be obtained directly from eq .",

    "an important limitation of our model is the presence of dispersion in realistic materials , while gravity is dispersionless .",
    "however , many materials including nonlinear ones have optical parameters which are relatively independent of frequency over a broad range .",
    "this typically occurs at frequencies below that of any resonances , that is , in the infrared part of the spectrum .",
    "so far our discussion has been at the classical level .",
    "now we wish to regard the background field as a quantized field operator @xmath45 , and to replace @xmath46 in the above expressions by an expectation value of the normal ordered square of this operator : @xmath47 the effective refractive index becomes an expectation value of eq .",

    "for which @xmath51 everywhere , we find @xmath52 .",
    "this is the classical behavior in which the effect of the background field is to slow the speed of probe pulses , and is analogous to the gravitational effects of positive energy density .",
