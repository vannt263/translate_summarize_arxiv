    "the hulthn potential [ 1 ] is a short - range potential in physics .",
    "the potential form is    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is a constant and @xmath5 is the screening parameter .",
    "if the potential is used for atoms , the @xmath4 is identified with the atomic number .",
    "this potential is a special case of the eckart potential [ 2 ] , which has been widely used in several branches of physics and its bound states and scattering properties have been investigated by a variety of techniques [ 3 ] .",
    "the radial schrdinger equation for the hulthn potential can be solved analytically only for @xmath6states ( @xmath7 [ 1,4,5]@xmath8 for @xmath9 a number of methods have been used to find bound - state energies numerically [ 3,6 - 16 ] and analytically [ 17,18 ] . in this context , we present in this letter a nikiforov - uvarov method [ 19 ] within the frame of @xmath0symmetric quantum mechanics [ 20 - 27 ] to solve analytically the hulthn superpotential partner ( @xmath10th member for non - zero angular momentum states given by ref.[18 ] :    @xmath11 \\frac{e^{-\\delta r}}{1-e^{-\\delta r}}+\\frac{% \\hbar ^{2}\\delta ^{2}}{2m}l(l+1)\\frac{e^{-2\\delta r}}{\\left ( 1-e^{-\\delta r}\\right ) ^{2}},\\text { } l=0,1,2, ... \\ ] ]    which is for @xmath6states is not shape invariant [ 28 ] and leads to the usual hulthn potential ( 1 ) . on the other hand , eq.(2 ) can be rearranged as    @xmath12    which is well - known as the approximate hulthn effective potential introduced by greene and aldrich [ 29 ] .",
    "the hulthn effective potential is taken as @xmath13 in atomic units . ]",
    "it is of much concern to see that for small values of @xmath14 eq.(3 ) becomes the effective coulomb potential given by    @xmath15    in the case of coulomb potential , the hamiltonian corresponds to the addition of an appropriate barrier potential and the so - called degenarcy is recovered as a natural consequence [ 18 ]",
    ". at small values of @xmath16 , the hulthn potential , behaves like a coulomb potential whereas for large values of @xmath16 it decreases exponentially so its capacity for bound state is smaller than the coulomb potential .",
    "the coulomb problem is analytically solvable for all energies and angular momenta . because of the similarity and points of contrast mentioned above between coulomb and hulthn potentials , it may be of much interest to use the hulthn superpotential partner , eq.(2 ) , to generate their eigenvalues and eigenfunctions in the framework of the @xmath0symmetric quantum mechanics by employing nikiforov - uvarov ( @xmath17 ) method .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section ii , we solve the schrdinger equation @xmath18 with hulthn superpotential for its energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions . in section iii , we consider the @xmath19 and @xmath20 cases and compare with the other works and methods .",
    "finally , section iv is for our conclusions .",
    "the nu method provides us an exact solution of non - relativistic se for certain kind of potentials [ 19 ] .",
    "the method is based upon the solutions of general second order linear differential equation with special orthogonal functions [ 31 ] . for a given real or complex potentials , the @xmath18 in one dimension , which is a @xmath0symmetric equation ,",
    "is reduced to a generalized equation of hypergeometric type with an appropriate @xmath21 coordinate transformation .",
    "thus , it takes the form :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are polynomials , at most of second - degree , and @xmath25 is of a first - degree polynomial . to find a particular solution for @xmath18 by separation of variables",
    ", we use the transformation given by    @xmath26    this reduces @xmath18 into an equation of hypergeometric type :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is found to isatisfy the condition @xmath29 further , @xmath30 is the hypergeometric type function whose polynomial solutions are given by rodrigues relation    @xmath31 , \\ ] ]    where @xmath32 is a normalizing constant and the weight function @xmath33 must satisfy the condition [ 19 ]    @xmath34    the function @xmath35 and the parameter @xmath36 required for this method are defined by @xmath37 and    @xmath38    here , @xmath35 is a polynomial with the parameter @xmath39 and the determination of @xmath40 is the essential point in the calculation of @xmath41 thus , for the determination of @xmath42 the discriminant under the square root is being set equal to zero and the resulting second - order polynomial has to be solved for its roots @xmath43 . hence , a new eigenvalue equation for the se becomes    @xmath44    where    @xmath45    and it will have a negative derivative .",
    "now , we follow ref.[32 ] , by rewritting eq.(2 ) in a quite simple form as    @xmath46    with    @xmath47 \\text { and \\ } v_{2}=\\frac{\\hbar ^{2}\\delta ^{2}}{2m}l(l+1).\\text{\\ } \\ ] ]    therefore , using the separation of variables    @xmath48    we may write the radial part of @xmath18 for all angular momentum states as    @xmath49    on the other hand , the one - dimensional counterpart of eq.(17 ) can be written , in a @xmath0 symmetric form , as    @xmath50 r(x)=0,\\ ] ]    and with the assignment @xmath51 then it becomes    @xmath52 r(s)=0,\\ ] ]    and also introducing the given dimensionless parameters    @xmath53    finally it leads into the following simple hypergeometric form given by    @xmath54 ^{2}}\\times \\left [ -\\left ( \\epsilon + \\beta + \\gamma \\right ) s^{2}+\\left ( 2\\epsilon + \\beta \\right ) s-\\epsilon \\right ] r(s)=0.\\ ] ]    hence , comparing the last equation with the generalized hypergeometric type , eq.(5 ) , we obtain the associated polynomials as    @xmath55    when these polynomials are substituted into eq.(10 ) , with @xmath56 we obtain    @xmath57    further , the discriminant of the upper expression under the square root has to be set equal to zero .",

    "e.g. , ref.[33 ] , eq.(78 ) ) if @xmath1 is set equal to zero .",
    "the above equation indicates that we deal with a family of hulthn potentials .",
    "at which @xmath82 is defined , in atomic units , by @xmath83 equation ( 32 ) agrees with eq.(5 ) in ref.[18 ] for @xmath20 case , and eq.(11 ) in ref.[30 ] for @xmath19 case .",
    "of course , it is clear that by imposing appropriate changes in the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath84 the index @xmath85 describes the quantization for the bound energy states .",
    "in addition , if the parameter @xmath86 in eq.(31 ) is adjusted to zero , solution reduces to the form obtained for the standard hulthn potential without a barrier term ( cf .",
    "e.g. , eqs.(14 ) and ( 15 ) with @xmath19 case ) .",

    "finally , the other part of the wave function in eq.(6 ) is found to be    @xmath95    combining the jacobi polynomials and @xmath28 in eq.(36 ) , the @xmath6wave functions ( @xmath7 could be determined as    @xmath96    with @xmath97 and @xmath98 is a new normalization constant .",

    "eigenvalues and eigenfunctions obtained from the real form of the potential are computed .",
    "therefore , the wave functions are physical and energy eigenvalues are in good agreement with the results obtained by the other methods . in this",

    "figure 2 plots the variation of the hulthn potential with @xmath16 for the @xmath99state with various screening parameters @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",

    ", table 1 shows the bound energy eigenvalues of the hulthn potential as a function of @xmath5 for various quantum numbers of @xmath106-state .",
    "these results are compared with other works [ 11,33 ] .",
    "further , the bound energy eigenvalues as a function of @xmath5 for the states @xmath107 ( @xmath108 and @xmath109 [ 30 ] are given in table 2@xmath8 comparison of our results with numerical data of refs.[3,30 ] is also given . however , since the form of the potential used in our work has a different form than the potential form used by ref.[30 ] in eq .",
    "( 14 ) , we have to add a perturbation term , @xmath110 to our calculations in order to substitute the small differences in [ 18 ] .",
    "better results have been obtained for the @xmath107 state for small values of @xmath5 since the effective potential ( 3 ) becomes closer to the original hulthn potential ( 1 ) and for small @xmath1 the contribution of this angular momentum term in potential is also small .",
    "therefore , if all the parameters of potential remain purely real , it is clear that all bound energies @xmath111 with @xmath112 represent a negative energy spectrum [ 32 ] .",
    "we also point out that the exact results obtained for the hulthn potential may have some interesting applications in the study of different quantum mechanical systems and atomic physics .",
