    "however a given state may not immediately lend itself for use in the envisioned communication task .",
    "one may have to transform it to another state , suitable for the particular communication task . and",

    "more precisely , do we have @xmath5 equal to unity ?",
    "we will call the quantity @xmath6 as the _ amount _ of the irreversibility in the transition @xmath7 .    in quantum information ,",
    "the maximally entangled states have a special significance .",
    "for example , they are the only states which one can use in faithful teleportation .",
    "it was convenient therefore to have special names for the rate @xmath3 and the inverse of the rate @xmath8 , when @xmath2 is a maximally entangled state in @xmath9 @xcite .",

    "we subsequently show in section [ ratio ] that these considerations can also be seen from the perspective of the ratio problem of entanglement measures @xcite . and",
    "the ratio problem discussed in this paper , is in a sense complementary to the one considered in ref .",

    "there arises therefore the question whether one can improve the inequalities by use of the results on asymptotic entanglement monotones @xcite .",
    "for example , it is known that entanglement measures satisfying some assumptions give upper bounds for @xmath33 ( distillable entanglement ) and lower bounds for @xmath34 ( entanglement cost ) .",

    "lower _ bound for @xmath33 , an operational approach usually can not be overcome : one needs to point out a specific protocol of distillation . and similarly for obtaining an _ upper _ bound of entanglement cost .",
    "it turns out that in our case , there is a similar issue",
    ". we will be able to prove an upper bound that refers to entanglement monotones , rather than to conversion rates .",
    "to this end let us recall @xcite that if a function @xmath35 is ( i ) nonincreasing under locc , and ( ii ) asymptotically continuous , then we have [ khub ] r ( ) where @xmath36 is the _ regularization _ of @xmath35 .",

    "@xmath41 we can recover the right - hand - side bound of formula ( [ eq - ineq2 ] ) ( even though we do not know if @xmath33 satisfies ( ii ) or if it is a regularization of some measure which satisfies ( i ) and ( ii ) ) .",

    "in this section we present some continuity arguments for @xmath44 that we will use later on .",

    "the only requirement that is needed to be imposed on an asymptotic measure of entanglement @xmath35 , for it to be continuous _ in any open set of distillable states _",

    "we will discuss in the next section ( section [ maxnotspecial ] ) , the inequality ( [ main ] ) can not be satisfied in this case .",
    "as singlets are useful in many quantum information processes , one may tend to believe that the amount of the irreversibility in the transition @xmath7 , that is @xmath69 , will somehow acquire an extreme value when the target @xmath2 is a singlet .",
    "but in this section , we will show by an explicit example that this is _ not _ the case .",

    "that is , @xmath44 is positive for @xmath153 ( for some @xmath154 ) , for all fixed values of @xmath63 and @xmath150 .",
    "we have @xmath73 on the intersection of @xmath155 and @xmath68 , whereby @xmath44 is negative on that intersection . via continuity of @xmath44 as well as",
    "due to the fact that the set of distillable states is open @xcite , @xmath44 will be negative for unequal @xmath1 and @xmath2 also , provided they are sufficiently close to each other as well as to the intersection of @xmath155 and @xmath68 .",

    "let us first briefly recall what is already known about the problem .",
    "this will provide a better setting for the aspect of the problem that we want to discuss .",
    "the distillable entanglement @xmath10 of a bipartite state @xmath1 is defined as an ( optimal ) asymptotic _ ratio_. it is the optimal asymptotic fraction of the number of faithful singlets ( @xmath29 ) obtainable via an locc protocol .",
    "it is therefore defined with the maximally entangled states as unit . as",
    "distillable entanglement is a measure of a physical quantity ( indicating the potential of @xmath1 to teleport , for example ) , the ratio of the distillable entanglements of different states , may be hoped to be independent of the chosen unit .",
    "the heights of two persons must have the same ratio whether their heights are measured in centimetres or inches .",
    "however it turned out that it is not true . in ref .",
    "@xcite , examples were cited for which @xmath156 the same problem arises for entanglement cost as well .",
    "let us now consider a complementary aspect of the ratio problem .",
    "the ratios discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite were between different states .",
    "can we not have such a ratio for a single state ?",
    "it should not be  different \" properties of the same state .",
    "the height to weight ratio of a person may vary in different unit systems .",
    "but the ratio of the height of an individual to the length of her / his arm must remain the same in any unit system .",
    "is this the case with distillable entanglement and entanglement cost of a state ?",
    "that is , are the ratios @xmath157 and @xmath158 equal ?    by what we have already shown in the previous sections , these ratios can be shown to be unequal in certain cases . indeed in the above case - studies one needs to substitute @xmath3 by @xmath16 and @xmath8 by @xmath159 as also @xmath160 by @xmath10 and @xmath161 by @xmath162 to obtain the envisioned nonequality @xmath163",
    "we have shown that the optimal asymptotic rate at which @xmath1 is retrieved ( under locc ) in a cycle @xmath164 via @xmath2 can be different for different @xmath2 .",
    "this gives a new dimension to the fundamental irreversibility in asymptotic manipulations of entanglement in that it provides in a natural way , a notion of the `` amount '' of the irreversibility in local asymptotic manipulations of a state .",
    "the considerations naturally led us to consider the quantity @xmath165 whose behavior we have tried to judge in certain simple cases . to judge the character of @xmath44 , we have used either certain bounds on the transformation ( derived in section [ def ] ) or we have used certain continuity arguments ( section [ cont ] ) .",
    "the exact value of the quantity is not known for a single nontrivial case .",
    "nevertheless , one can have a feel for the general behavior of this difference .",
    "consider a distillable state @xmath51 in @xmath166 for which @xmath167 is strictly less than @xmath168 .",
    "then @xmath169 therefore @xmath44 , for @xmath170 , is strictly less than zero . from the continuity of @xmath44 , which we proved earlier , and as the set of distillable states is open @xcite , it follows that negativity ( of @xmath44 ) remains for @xmath1 and @xmath2 sufficiently close to @xmath51 . on the other hand , @xmath171",
    "therefore @xmath44 is strictly positive for @xmath172 and @xmath173 . and again by continuity",
    ", @xmath44 is positive for @xmath1 and @xmath2 sufficiently close to @xmath29 and @xmath51 respectively .      here",
    "we will like to discuss the issue of the behaviour of the quantity @xmath44 near separable states .",
    "for example , consider the case when @xmath1 and @xmath2 are mixtures of two bell states ( given by eqs .",
    "( [ rhotwobell ] ) and ( [ sigmatwobell ] ) ) .",
    "we are interested to find the value of @xmath44 as we approach the point @xmath175 .",
    "note that at @xmath99 , @xmath1 is a separable state .",
    "it may seem that in general , the rate @xmath6 at which @xmath1 is retrieved in a return journey via @xmath2 is vanishing in the limit when @xmath2 approaches to a separable state while @xmath1 remains distillable . in the case when @xmath1 is given by eqs .",
    "( [ rhotwobell ] ) , we have checked that @xmath176 as @xmath98 @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ rdifffig ] , we have plotted @xmath177 as @xmath98 with this intuition .",
    "we will now see that if we assume that @xmath178 as @xmath2 approaches to a separable state ( with @xmath1 remaining distillable ) , then one can arrive at examples of states for which the ppt - distillable entanglement is strictly greater than its locc distillable entanglement .",
    "the example is against the conjecture given in @xcite that for maximally correlated states , @xmath179 .",
    "let us mention however that we are not in a position to give a counterexample to this conjecture .",
    "we merely show that a counterexample exists if we believe that @xmath178 as @xmath2 approaches to a separable state ( with @xmath1 remaining distillable ) .",
    "consider the state @xmath180 and the rate @xmath181 note here that the state is product when @xmath65 . therefore according to our assumption ,",
    "@xmath182 as @xmath183 . for the state @xmath1 , we know the values of ppt - distillable entanglement @xcite as well as its entanglement cost ( section [ maxcorr ] )",
    ". one can easily check that the quantity @xmath184 tends to @xmath185 as @xmath64 tends to @xmath186 .",
    "thus , modulo our assumption , we have that @xmath105 is strictly greater than @xmath33 for states @xmath187 which are sufficiently close to @xmath188 .    as and us",
