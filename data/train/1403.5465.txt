    "interest is growing in the physics of a possible future hadron collider ( fhc ) which will take over the energy frontier sometime after the running of the hl - lhc been has completed@xcite .",
    "cern has already begun a 5-year study to investigate this possibility@xcite .",
    "presently , the fhc is currently envisioned as having a center - of - mass energy of @xmath3 tev and having the capability to accumulate integrated luminosities of order @xmath4 ab@xmath5 or greater . as is well - known ,",
    "the lhc has / had ` the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking in the standard model ' as a known no - loose physics target to set its energy scale .",
    "clearly , with the discovery of the higgs boson in 2012 , the lhc has already been quite successful in this regard .",
    "the 100 tev energy for the fhc , on the otherhand , represents an educated extrapolation of what might be possible given foreseeable technological improvements without incurring ` prohibitive ' costs while simultaneously allowing for the opening up of potential new physics thresholds .",
    "the fhc is thus truly a machine of exploration as were the accelerators of earlier generations . of course ,",
    "in a more general context , the physics associated with such higher energy hadron colliders beyond the lhc has been frequently discussed from time to time over the past two decades@xcite since the cancellation of the ssc .",
    "one of the historic and standard new physics benchmarks that is always employed in the study of the potential capabilities of future colliders is the production and examination of new neutral ( @xmath1 ) and charged ( @xmath2 ) gauge bosons@xcite the reason being that they are a relatively common occurrence in many beyond the standard model ( bsm ) scenarios and they ( usually ) have relatively clean leptonic signatures .",
    "this may be of particular relevance at a high luminosity @xmath0 tev machine where one can presently only guess at the difficulty of making measurements within this challenging hadronic environment .",
    "while previous works@xcite have provided us with some idea as to what to expect as far as the discovery potential for @xmath6 might be at the fhc , here we wish to go somewhat further in both the quantification of these results and to address the question of how well such new states might be studied assuming that they are indeed discovered . in order to make direct contact",
    "with many past studies@xcite we will restrict ourselves to the somewhat traditional set of bsm models containing @xmath7 considered there .",
    "we remind the reader that this does not in any way exhaust the range of possibilities for such new states but it does give us a respectable range of predictions to examine for what one might expect at 100 tev . here we will also restrict our attention to the relatively safe final states which employ at least one ( very ) high @xmath8 lepton trigger due to the unknown nature of the hadronic environment and pile - up conditions the detectors may have to deal with at 100 tev as mentioned earlier . furthermore",
    ", we will concentrate mostly on electron final states as muon @xmath8 resolution for ( many ) mult - tev muons is likely to be difficult with the typical magnetic fields that are currently available given finite detector size even when we allow for factors of two scaling in both these quantities .",
    "we note that if the muon pair mass resolution is sufficiently degraded this will have a significant impact on narrow @xmath1 searches in this channel .",
    "present measurements by both atlas@xcite and cms@xcite at @xmath9 tev with @xmath10  fb@xmath5 of integrated luminosity can only provide lower bounds on the masses of possible new @xmath6 states .",
    "for example , if these states have couplings identical to those of the corresponding sm gauge bosons ( , the so - called ssm ` model ' ) their masses must exceed 2.96 and 3.35 tev , respectively .",
    "of course for other types of couplings , quite different , generally somewhat weaker results are obtained as in the case of an @xmath11-inspired @xmath1@xcite . eventually , at the 14 tev hl - lhc , search sensitivities for the same @xmath12 and @xmath13 states may be as large as @xmath14 tev@xcite depending upon whether they are discovered or excluded . in what follows",
    "we will generally assume that the masses of these new states are beyond the reach of the hl - lhc at least to study in any detail even if they were to be in fact discovered there .",
    "in the analysis below we will examine not only the discovery and exclusion rates for these new states at 100 tev but also survey how data obtainable by experiments at the fhc may be used to determine their detailed properties through a number of different observables .",
    "this survey is not meant to be either exhaustive or conclusive but only to provide a first glimpse at what some of these possibilities might be based on earlier studies performed for other hadron colliders .",
    "much work will still be needed to examine the feasibility of the use of the many observables discussed below for the study of new gauge bosons at the fhc .",
    "we first consider new @xmath1 gauge bosons in the next section and then turn our attention to the @xmath2 case in section 3 .",
    "section 4 contains a discussion and our conclusions .",
    "the appendix considers the case of ssm @xmath1 and @xmath2 gauge bosons but with non - ssm coupling strengths .",
    "the first issue we address is the obvious one : what is the mass reach for @xmath1 gauge boson discovery or exclusion at @xmath0 tev ?",
    "the usual approach as performed at the lhc has two components : ( @xmath15 ) compare the expected opposite - sign dilepton invariant mass distribution with the sm expectations and look for excesses at high mass and then either claim an excess or set a limit ( @xmath16 ) compare the expected number of ( excess ? ) dilepton events with the the narrow - width approximation ( nwa ) cross section ( times leptonic branching fraction ) for the the @xmath1 within a given bsm model . to perform the corresponding calculations here for the fhc we will assume a detector below with a lepton rapidity coverage ( @xmath17 ) and electron em energy resolution similar to that of the present atlas detector and , to be specific",
    ", we will make use of the default nlo cteq6.6 pdfs@xcite and scale the relevant cross sections employing nlo k - factors@xcite when obtaining our numerical results percent . ] .",
    "@xmath1 ( and correspondingly @xmath2 below ) partial widths will be calculated including nlo and partial nnlo qcd corrections as well as the corresponding nlo qed corrections . as a final comment",
    ", we note that these calculations will be performed using a fixed - width prescription for the @xmath1 but one can easily check that identical results are obtained using the running - width instead given the resulting level of statistics .",
    "to begin our analysis it is instructive to examine the resonance signal structure for @xmath1 production in the drell - yan dielectron mass distribution at 100 tev .",
    "a first example of this is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig01 ] and  [ fig02 ] which show the drell - yan mass distributions for several different @xmath1 models assuming a mass of either 16 or 21 tev along with the associated sm backgrounds taking an integrated luminosity of 1 ab@xmath5 . from the upper panel of fig ,  [ fig01 ]",
    ", it is fairly obvious that for a mass of 16 tev with this luminosity all of these models predict an easily visible signal above the sm background . in the lower panel",
    "we see how the signals will respond if the dilepton mass resolution were to become worse by a factor of 2 ; clearly all the states still remain easily visible .",
    "it is important to note that in most of these models the width to mass ratio of the @xmath1 is quite comparable to and frequently less than these resolutions which imply that it is the resolution itself that often controls the ` lineshape ' and not the actual @xmath1 width . on the otherhand , when the @xmath1 mass is increased to 21 tev ( not a randomly chosen number ) , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] , it is a bit less obvious how statistically convincing the signal remains in all these different cases .",
    "however , by counting events , we find that most of these models _ would _ likely be discovered although several lie ( very ) close to the statistical boundary @xmath18 signal events in this mass region since it essentially background - free .",
    "of course , the corresponding dimuon sample could also be potentially helpful here but given the likely inferior mass resolution for dimuons its not clear by how much without some further assumptions .",
    "certainly the dimuon distribution would also likely show a high mass excess confirming that in dielectrons but would not yield a very reliable determination of the peak mass value since this excess would likely be quite broadly distributed .",
    "it would seem that for this class of models @xmath19 tev represents a rough estimate of the rough lower mass limit for discovery .     at the fhc : the red ( green , blue , magenta , cyan ) histogram is for the ssm ( left - right model ( lrm )  @xcite , @xmath11 models @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively ) .",
    "the yellow histogram is the sm background .",

    "[ fig03 ] and in table  [ rates1 ] .",
    "[ fig03 ] shows the dilepton production signal cross section via the @xmath1 arising in different models calculated in the nwa including acceptance cuts for both @xmath22 and 100 tev . in this figure",
    "we see several things : for example , even within this rather restricted set of models the cross sections can vary by about a factor of @xmath23 at any given mass value .",
    "furthermore , we see that at large masses , for a fixed value of the cross section , going from @xmath22 to 100 tev will allow us to increase the reach by roughly @xmath24 tev . for later discussions ,",

    "these values will be important when we examine statistical errors on the various quantities we introduce below .",

    "[ fig08 ] shows that this quantity , if measurable , has quite significant coupling sensitivity .",
    "however , at the 100 tev fhc , performing this measurement using , , the @xmath30 or @xmath31 decays from the @xmath29 may prove to be rather difficult given the rather complex hadronic environment one might naively expect .",
    "however this is certainly worthy of further study .",
    "as discussed above , here we have been limiting our discussion to signals employing leptonic triggers so that we will not consider modes such as @xmath32 .",
    "thus we are led to consider 3-body decays involving leptons such as @xmath33 and @xmath34 and , in particular the ratios of the partial widths for these reactions relative to that for @xmath35 denoted as @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the literature@xcite .",
    "as discussed above , we employ these ratios to remove the potential sensitivity to non - sm @xmath1 decays . assuming that the @xmath38 coupling is absent at tree - level ( which it is in the gut - type models under consideration in the absence of @xmath39 mixing which we assume here ) , these processes occur by the emission of @xmath40 gauge bosons from one of the lepton legs in ordinary @xmath1 dilepton decays . at the lhc , for @xmath1 masses",
    "@xmath41 tev , these ratios were shown to be useful for coupling determinations but suffered from small statistics .",
    "we note in fig .",
    "[ fig09 ] , however , that @xmath37 ( and similarly @xmath36 ) grow like @xmath42 due to the near infrared and co - linear sigularities in the relevant graphs .",

    "all calculations for the @xmath2 will be performed in the same manner as in the @xmath1 case above making use of the same inputs and assumptions .",

    "( here we will need to assume that the fhc detector(s ) can easily identify large amounts of met with atlas - like resolution . ) to this end it is instructive to examine these distributions for different values of the @xmath2 mass assuming either lh or rh couplings to the usual sm fermions .",

    "( @xmath16 ) the behavior of the @xmath69 distribution in the neighborhood of the jacobian peak is the same ( within statistics ) whether the @xmath2 is lh or rh .",
    "this conforms with our expectations from the nwa analysis above .",
    "( @xmath66 ) the overall shapes of the @xmath69 distributions for the lh and rh @xmath2 couplings are _ not _ the same@xcite and cms@xcite in particular has exploited this fact as part of their @xmath2 search .",
    "this difference is particularly noticeable in two regions : for @xmath70 and above the jacobian peak . in the lower mass region",
    "we see that the lh result lies below the rh one whereas above the jacobian peak the reverse is true .",
    "this difference is due to the interference ( or lack thereof ) between the @xmath2 and the sm @xmath50 amplitudes . in the lh case ,",
    "these amplitudes have opposite signs below the jacobian peak but add constructively above it . in the rh @xmath2 case , however , there is no interference with the sm @xmath50 amplitude since the sm fermions in both the initial and final states are treated as massless .",
    "it is clear from these figures that this difference in the @xmath69 distributions is apparently visible ( at this assumed integrated luminosity ) for @xmath2 masses possibly as large as @xmath10 tev and may be potentially so even for somewhat larger masses even though all these values are still significantly below the corresponding discovery reach .",
    "clearly no difference would be observable for a mass of 30 tev although an excess of events would still be seen in both helicity cases . to get a clearer idea of the size of this cross section difference due to the @xmath2 coupling helicity (",
    "since the figures can be sometimes misleading due to the small @xmath69 bin size ) let us first imagine that a @xmath2 has been seen at a given mass through its jacobian peak .",
    "one can then just count the total number of events in the @xmath69 distribution in the region where the interference is most important , @xmath71 , say , and compare the expectations in the two cases . for a lh(rh ) @xmath2 with a mass of 12 tev and an integrated luminosity of 1 ab@xmath5 one obtains 8153(9818 ) events which certainly differ by more than @xmath72(statistical errors only ) .",

    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 production are standard benchmarks for study of the physics capabilities of any new collider . in this paper , we have examined the production properties of these new particles at the fhc , in particular , with eye towards understanding its ability to explore their couplings to the usual sm fermions .",
    "this is a necessary first step in uncovering the underlying theory from which such new particles might spring .",
    "of course the fhc is a long way from where we are now and one needs to make extrapolations on the theoretical side ( , pdfs , ) as well as make some guesses as to what objects might be well measured on the experimental side at such energies .",
    "for example , final states composed of purely hadronic objects or observables requiring b - tagging might be generally difficult to employ given the expected number of multiple interactions at 100 tev with reasonable luminosities .",
    "furthermore , it is likely that muon momenta in the multi - tev range would be difficult to measure with high precision without enormous magnetic fields and/or bending radii . here",
    ", we have assumed that electron energies ( and to some extent met for the @xmath2 case ) can be as well measured by the fhc experiments as is presently done by the lhc experiments .",
    "given these caveats , it is quite clear that the fhc will not only provide a huge step in the reach for these @xmath1 and @xmath2 states but will allow for a sufficient number of electron - based observables to be examined so that we can learn something substantial about their couplings to the sm . if multiple interactions could be dealt with and muon - based observables can also be employed , these conclusions will only be strengthened .",
    "it is not likely , however , that such information would be obtainable for new gauge boson masses which lie within @xmath107 tev of the corresponding discovery reaches without significant luminosity increases after the fact ( due to simple statistical limitations ) or through the application of observables we have not considered here . in performing these studies we have employed a very familiar and long - used set of models with which we can make direct comparisons to other previous experimental and theoretical analyses .",
    "however , it is important to recall that this set , though somewhat representative of a more general class of theories , does not in any way span the full range of possibilities that experimenters might encounter at the fhc . further study of new gauge boson physics at the fhc is certainly needed .",
    "clearly , much work will be required to understand what the full capabilities of the fhc might be .",
    "however , it is clear that the fhc would provide a giant step forward in the search for bsm physics and hopefully its construction will be realized sometime in the future .",

    "hewett for discussions related to the work .",

    "this work was supported by the department of energy , contract de - ac02 - 76sf00515 .",
    "it is sometimes useful to ask what would happen to the discovery reach for @xmath1 and @xmath2 gauge bosons if their couplings differed from those in specified in a given model , particularly if they were weaker . to attempt to address this question here ,",
    "we briefly consider the ssm @xmath7 gauge bosons but with couplings that differ in overall strengths than those discussed above .",
    "extrapolation to _ larger _",
    "couplings is rather straightforward as in the mass ranges of interest the signals remain in a region where there is essentially no ( non - fake ) sm backgrounds .",
    "this is of course no longer true when we consider _ weaker _ couplings and correspondingly smaller masses . in particular , once a region of low mass with significant sm background is reached one quickly becomes dominated by the systematic errors associated with our knowledge of this background due to the large integrated luminosities that we consider .",
    "this is certainly a subject worthy of some detailed study by the future fhc experimental collaborations as this relies on more of the detailed properties of possible detectors than is within the scope of the present work .",
    "_ if _ we assume that these backgrounds can be controlled and understood at the same @xmath108 level of uncertainty as claimed by atlas and cms for the hl - lhc@xcite , then we can get an estimate of what the discovery reach might be for these @xmath7 states with weaker couplings . to get an idea of what might be possible at the fhc we will make this assumption below for the dilepton invariant mass region above a few tev .        following this approach",
    "we obtain the results as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] for both the ssm @xmath1 and @xmath2 with scaled couplings . in the @xmath1 case",
    ", we see that for @xmath109 the discovery reach for 1 ab@xmath5 is reduced to @xmath110 tev . in the corresponding @xmath2 case",
    "we see that the discovery reach is reduced to @xmath111 tev . in both cases",
    "we note that at very low masses and small relative couplings the search reaches ` saturate ' in the sense that smaller couplings can not be probed with this level of systematic error given our rather simplified approach .",
    "this happens for masses below @xmath23 tev , with corresponding couplings less than @xmath112 , in the case of the @xmath2 and at masses of @xmath113 tev and the corresponding coupling below @xmath114 for the @xmath1 .",
