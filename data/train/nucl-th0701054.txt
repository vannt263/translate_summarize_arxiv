    "the investigation of nuclear structure is one of the most important and ambitious aims of hadronic physics .",
    "a reasonable starting point is offered by the independent particle shell model .",
    "however , the incorporation of additional short - range correlations ( src ) beyond a mean - field description turns out to be inevitably necessary for a proper description of nuclear binding .",
    "the most direct reaction to study src is naturally electromagnetically induced two - nucleon knockout .",
    "intuitively , the probability that a photon is absorbed by a nucleon pair should be a direct measure for src .",
    "however , due to competing two - body effects like meson - exchange currents ( mec ) or final state interactions ( fsi ) , this simple picture needs to be modified in order to obtain quantitative predictions .",
    "ideally , the role of mec and fsi should be small or at least under control in order to extract information on src from experiment .",
    "this requires a theoretical approach which should be as comprehensive as possible .",
    "an overview over the available theoretical models till the middle of the 90s can be found in @xcite . presently , different models are available ( see @xcite and references therein ) . due to the conceptual complexity of the nuclear many - body problem , various approximations and simplifying assumptions are needed for practical calculations .",
    "thus , usually different treatments of initial bound and final scattering states are adopted in the models .    in the pavia model @xcite bound and scattering states are , in principle , consistently derived as eigenfunctions of an energy - dependent non - hermitian feshbach - type optical potential",
    ". however , in actual calculations the initial hadronic state is obtained from a recent calculation of the two - nucleon spectral function @xcite where different types of correlations are included consistently .",
    "for the final hadronic state , a complex phenomenological optical potential , derived through a fit to nucleon - nucleus scattering data , is used for the description of the fsi between the outgoing nucleons and the residual nucleus . the mutual nucleon - nucleon interaction ( nn - fsi ) in the final state can be taken into account at least perturbatively @xcite .    independently of the specific prescriptions adopted in the calculations ,",
    "a conceptual problem arises in the model where the initial and final states , which are eigenfunctions of an energy - dependent optical potential at different energies , are , as such , not orthogonal .",
    "indeed , the process involves transitions between bound and continuum states which must be orthogonal , since they are eigenfunctions of the full nuclear many - body hamiltionian at different energies .",
    "orthogonality is in general lost in a model when the descripion is restricted to a subspace where other channels are suppressed .",
    "the description of direct knockout reactions in terms of the eigenfunctions of a complex energy - dependent optical potential considers only partially the contribution of competing inelastic channels .",
    "the remaining effects due to occuring inelasticities can , in principle , be taken into account by a suitable effective transition operator , which removes the orthogonality defect of the model wave functions @xcite . in practice , however , the usual approach does not make use of an effective operator .    the present paper deals with the proper treatment of all the cm effects in the matrix elements of the one - body nuclear current in connection with the problem of the lack of orthogonality between initial and final states in the calculation of the cross section of the electromagnetic two - nucleon knockout reactions .",
    "the reaction mechanism and cm effects are discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : reaction ] .",
    "different prescriptions are proposed to cure the spuriosity which may result in the numerical calculations as a consequence of the orthogonality defect .",
    "these prescriptions are discussed and related to a proper treatment of all the cm effects in the transition matrix elements . in sect .",

    "( [ eq : jq ] ) contains three main ingredients : the two - nucleon scattering wave function @xmath11 , the nuclear current @xmath12 and the two - nucleon overlap integral ( tof ) @xmath13 between the ground state of the target and the final state of the residual nucleus .",
    "the nuclear current @xmath12 is the sum of a one - body and a two - body contribution , i.e. @xmath14 the one - body ( ob ) part includes the longitudinal charge term and the transverse convective and spin currents , and can be written as @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "the two - body current is derived from the effective lagrangian of @xcite , performing a non relativistic reduction of the lowest - order feynman diagrams with one - pion exchange .",
    "we have thus currents corresponding to the seagull and pion - in - flight diagrams , and to the diagrams with intermediate @xmath5-isobar configurations  @xcite , i.e. @xmath17 for two - proton emission the seagull and pion - in - flight meson - exchange currents and the charge - exchange contribution of the @xmath5-current are vanishing in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "the surviving components of the @xmath5-current can be written as @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",

    "( [ eq : jq ] ) , for the three - body system consisting of the two protons , 1 and 2 , and of the residual nucleus @xmath20 , it appears to be natural to work with cm coordinates @xcite @xmath21 the conjugated momenta are given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the momentum of the residual nucleus in the laboratory frame .    with the help of these relations",
    ", one can cast the transition amplitude ( [ eq : jq ] ) into the following form @xmath24 with the definition @xmath25 and the expression @xmath26    it is generally thought that the contribution of the ob current to two - nucleon knockout is entirely due to the correlations included in the two - nucleon wave function .",
    "in fact , a ob operator can not affect two particles if they are not correlated .",
    "it can be seen , however , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : opcm ] ) that in the cm frame the transition operator becomes a two - body operator even in the case of a ob nuclear current . only in the limit",

    "( [ eq : jqcm ] ) vanishes for a pure ob current in eq .",
    "( [ eq : opcm ] ) sandwiched between orthogonalized single particle ( s.p . ) wave functions .",
    "this means that , due to this cm effect , for finite nuclei the ob current can give a contribution to the cross section of two - particle emission independently of correlations .",
    "this effect is similar to the one of the effective charges in electromagnetic reactions  @xcite .",
    "the matrix elements of eq .",
    "( [ eq : jqcm ] ) involve bound and scattering states , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which are consistently derived from an energy - dependent non - hermitian feshbach - type hamiltonian for the considered final state of the residual nucleus .",
    "they are eigenfunctions of this hamiltonian at negative and positive energy values @xcite . however , in practice",
    ", it is not possible to achieve this consistency and the treatment of initial and final states proceeds separately with different approximations .    the two - nucleon overlap function ( tof ) @xmath28 contains information on nuclear structure and correlations .",
    "different approaches are used in @xcite . in the present calculations",
    "the tof is obtained as in @xcite , from the most recent calculation of the two - proton spectral function of @xmath0o , where both src and long - range correlations are included consistently with a two - step procedure .    in the calculation of the final - state wave function",
    "@xmath29 only the interaction of each one of the two outgoing nucleons with the residual nucleus is included .",
    "therefore , the scattering state is written as the product of two uncoupled s.p . distorted wave functions , eigenfunctions of a complex phenomenological optical potential which contains a central , a coulomb , and a spin - orbit term @xcite .",
    "the effect of the mutual interaction between the two outgoing nucleons has been studied in @xcite and can in principle be included as in @xcite .",
    "the matrix element of eq .",
    "( [ eq : jqcm ] ) contains a spurious contribution since it does not vanish when the transition operator @xmath30 is set equal to 1 .",
    "this is essentially due to the lack of orthogonality between the initial and the final state wave functions . in the model",
    "the use of an effective nuclear current operator removes the orthogonality defect besides taking into account space truncation effects @xcite . in the usual approach of eq .",
    "( [ eq : jqcm ] ) , however , the effective operator is replaced by the bare nuclear current operator .",
    "thus , it is this replacement which may introduce a spurious contribution which is not specifically due to the different prescriptions adopted in practical calculations , but is already present in eq .",
    "( [ eq : jqcm ] ) , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are eigenfunctions of an energy - dependent feshbach - type hamiltonian at different energies . in the past",
    "this spuriousity was cured by subtracting from the transition amplitude the contribution of the ob current without correlations in the nuclear wave functions . in detail",
    ", the expression @xmath31 was subtracted from ( [ eq : jqcm ] ) , where in the initial state @xmath32 src are ignored .",
    "this prescription is denoted as approach a in the proceeding discussions . in this approach , however , we do not subtract only the spuriosity , but also the cm effect given by the two - body operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : opcm ] ) , which is present in the ob current independently of correlations and which is not spurious .",
    "the relevance of this effect can be estimated comparing our previous results with the results of a different prescription , that is denoted as approach b in the proceeding discussions , where we subtract from ( [ eq : jqcm ] ) instead of ( [ eq : jqcm2 ] ) the spurious contribution due to the ob current without correlations and without cm corrections .",
    "this can be achieved by putting the limit @xmath27 in ( [ eq : jqcm2 ] ) , i.e.  by the expression @xmath33 this prescription gives an improved , although still rough , evaluation of the spurious contribution .",
    "an alternative and more accurate procedure to get rid of the spuriosity is to enforce orthogonality between the initial and final states by means of a gram - schmidt orthogonalization @xcite . in this approach each one of the two s.p .",
    "distorted wave functions is orthogonalized to all the s.p .",
    "shell - model wave functions that are used to calculate the tof , i.e. , for the tof of @xcite , to the h.o .",
    "states of the basis used in the calculation of the spectral function , which range from the @xmath34 up to the @xmath35-@xmath36 shell .",
    "this more accurate procedure , that we denote as approach c in the proceeding discussions , allows us to get rid of the spurious contribution to two - nucleon emission due to a ob operator acting on either nucleon of an uncorrelated pair , which is due to the lack of orthogonality between the s.p .",
    "bound and scattering states of the pair . in this approach , in consequence , no ob current contribution without correlations like ( [ eq : jqcm2 ] ) or ( [ eq : jqcm3 ] ) needs to be subtracted .",
    "moreover , it allows us to include automatically all cm effects via ( [ eq : opcm ] ) .",
    "the effects of cm and orthogonalization have been investigated for the exclusive @xmath0o(e , e@xmath1pp)@xmath2c and @xmath0o(@xmath3,pp)@xmath2c reactions .",
    "calculations performed in different situations indicate that the results depend on kinematics and on the prescriptions adopted to treat the theoretical ingredients of the model .",
    "the contribution due to the cm effects in the ob current without correlations , that were neglected in our previous calculations , are in general non negligible .",
    "although in many situations this contribution is small and does not change significantly the results , there are also situations where it is large and produces important quantitative and qualitative differences .",
    "this is the case of the super - parallel kinematics , where these effects are maximized .",
    "the super - parallel kinematics is therefore of particular interest for our study .    in the so - called super - parallel kinematics",
    "the two nucleons are ejected parallel and anti - parallel to the momentum transfer and , for a fixed value of the energy @xmath37 and momentum transfer @xmath38 , it is possible to explore , for different values of the kinetic energies of the outgoing nucleons , all possible values of the recoil momentum @xmath39 .",
    "this kinematical setting has been widely investigated in our previous work @xcite and is of particular interest from the experimental point of view , since it has been realized in the recent @xmath0o(e , e@xmath1pp)@xmath2c @xcite and @xmath0o(e , e@xmath1pn)@xmath2n @xcite experiments at mami .",
    "the super - parallel kinematics chosen for the present calculations of the @xmath0o(e , e@xmath1pp)@xmath2c reaction is the same already considered in our previous work and realized in the experiment @xcite at mami , i.e. the incident electron energy is @xmath40 mev , @xmath41 mev , and @xmath42 mev/@xmath43 .    the cross section of the @xmath0o(e , e@xmath1pp)@xmath2c reaction to the @xmath44 ground state of @xmath2c calculated in the super - parallel kinematics is displayed in fig .",
    "[ cm1 ] for the three different approaches a ( dotted ) , b ( dashed ) and c ( solid ) .",
    "the cm contribution included in approach b produces a large enhancement of the cross section calculated with the ob current . the results are shown in the right panel of the figure , where it can be seen that the enhancement is large for recoil momentum values up to about 300 mev/@xmath43 and is a factor of about 5 in the maximum region .",
    "a similar result is obtained with orthogonalized initial and final states . in this case",
    "the ob cross section is a bit larger at low values of the recoil momentum and a bit lower at larger values of @xmath39 .",
    "the results depicted by the dashed and solid lines in fig .  [ cm1 ] correspond to the two different procedures proposed to cure the spuriosity due to the lack orthogonality between initial and final states in the model . in the dashed line the spurious contribution",
    "is subtracted , in the solid line orthogonality between the s.p .",
    "states is restored . with respect to the previous result , shown by the dotted line",
    ", the dashed line includes all the cm effects , the solid line takes into account , in addition , also the effect due to the lack of orthogonality .",
    "it can be clearly seen from the comparison shown in the figure that the large difference between the old and the new results is mostly due to the cm effects and not to the treatment of the spuriosity or to the restoration of orthogonality between the initial and final state wave functions of the model .",
    "the final cross sections given by the sum of the ob and the two - body @xmath5-currents are compared in the left panel of fig .",
    "calculations have been performed with the so - called @xmath5(nn ) parametrization @xcite for the @xmath5-current , i.e. the parameters have been fixed considering the nn - scattering in the @xmath5-region , where a reasonable description of data is achieved with parameters similar to the ones of the full bonn potential @xcite .",
    "it was shown and explained in @xcite that in the super - parallel kinematics , and for the transition to the ground state of @xmath2c , a regularized prescription for the @xmath5 , such as , e.g. , @xmath5(nn ) , produces a destructive interference with the ob current which makes the final cross section lower than the ob one .",
    "this reduction is strong in our previous calculation of @xcite , up to about one order of magnitude .",
    "the relevance of the destructive interference depends , however , on the relative weight of the ob and @xmath5-current contributions @xcite .",
    "the strong enhancement of the ob current contribution produced in the new calculations by cm effects reduces the destructive interference between the ob and @xmath5-currents .",
    "thus , only a slight reduction of the ob current contribution is obtained in the new calculations by the addtional incorporation of the @xmath5-current .",
    "the final cross section is completely dominated by the ob current and at low values of the recoil momentum it is more than one order of magnitude larger than the one obtained in the old calculations .",
    "an enhancement factor of about 30 is given in the maximum region .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that dramatic differences are found in the super - parallel kinematics with different parametrizations of the @xmath5-current and with different tofs .",
    "the cross sections calculated in approach c for different @xmath5-parametrizations are shown in fig .",
    "the result with the regularized @xmath5(nn ) prescription , already shown in fig .",
    "[ cm1 ] , is compared with the one given by the simpler unregularized approach @xmath5(noreg ) of @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the final cross sections calculated with these two parametrizations differ up to about one order of magnitude .",
    "only small differences are obtained in fig .",
    "the cross section with @xmath5(nn ) is a bit lower and the one with @xmath5(noreg ) a bit higher than the cross section given by the ob current .",
    "we note that the orthogonalized wave functions are used also in the calculation of the matrix elements with the @xmath5-current , where the effect of orthogonalization is anyhow negligible . in practice , in the present calculations the contribution of the @xmath5-current is the same as in @xcite .",
    "thus , the large difference with respect to the results of @xcite in figs .",
    "[ cm1 ] and [ cm2 ] is due to the cm effects in the ob current and , as a consequence , to the strong reduction of the destructive interference between the ob and the @xmath5-current contribution calculated with the @xmath5(nn ) parametrization .",
    "the cross sections shown in fig .",
    "[ cm3 ] are calculated with the simpler tof of @xcite , where the two - nucleon wave function is given by the product of a coupled and antisymmetrized shell model pair function and of a jastrow - type central and state independent correlation function , taken from @xcite . in this approach",
    "only src are considered and the final state of the residual nucleus is a pure two - hole state .",
    "the ground state of @xmath2c is a ( @xmath45)@xmath46 hole in @xmath0o .",
    "thus , in the orthogonalized calculation the s.p . distorted wave functions are orthogonalized only to the @xmath45 state .    the differences between the results of approaches a and c , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ cm3 ] , are significant , although less dramatic than those with the tof from the spectral function displayed in fig .",
    "[ cm1 ] , and do not change the main qualitative features of the previous results .",
    "it can be noted that in fig .",
    "[ cm3 ] the differences are larger at larger values of the recoil momentum , i.e. in the kinematical region where the differences between the corresponding results in fig .",
    "[ cm1 ] are strongly reduced .",
    "thus , the cm effects included in the present calculations drastically reduce the sensitivity to the treatment of the @xmath5-current found in @xcite for the super - parallel kinematics .",
    "these cm effects are , however , very sensitive to the treatment of the tof .",
    "the large differences given in the orthogonalized approach c by the two tofs in figs .",
    "[ cm1 ] and [ cm3 ] confirm that the cross sections are very sensitive to the treatment of correlations in the tof .",
    "this result strongly motivates further research , both from the experimental as well as from the theoretical side , in the field of pp - knockout .",
    "similar calculations performed for the transition to the @xmath47 excited state of @xmath2c do not show any significant difference with respect to our previous results shown in @xcite .    the effect of the mutual interaction between the two outgoing protons ( nn - fsi ) has been neglected in the calculations presented till now because it is not relevant to investigate cm effects .",
    "nn - fsi has been studied within a perturbative treatment in @xcite , where it is found that the effect depends on the kinematics and on the type of reaction considered .",
    "since nn - fsi turns out to be particularly strong just for the @xmath0o(e , e@xmath1pp)@xmath2c@xmath48 reaction and in the super - parallel kinematics , it can be interesting to give here only one numerical example for this case , just to show how our previous results of @xcite change in the orthogonalized approach .",
    "the effect of the nn - fsi on the cross section of the @xmath0o(e , e@xmath1pp)@xmath2c@xmath48 reaction in the super - parallel kinematics is shown in fig .",
    "the results obtained in the approach considered till now ( dw ) , where only the interaction of each one of the outgoing nucleons with the residual nucleus is considered , are compared with the results of the more complete treatment ( dw - nn ) where also the mutual interaction between the two outgoing nucleons is included within the same perturbative approach as in @xcite .",
    "the cross sections given by the separate contributions of the ob and @xmath5-current , as well as the ones given by the sum ob+@xmath5 , are displayed in the figure .",
    "these results can be compared with the corresponding ones presented in figs .  3 and 4 of @xcite , which differ not only because the calculations of fig .",
    "[ cm4 ] are performed with orthogonalized initial and final states , but also because a different @xmath5-parametrization and a different tof are used in the two calculations .",
    "in fact , the @xmath5(nn ) parametrization is used in fig .",
    "[ cm4 ] compared to an old prescription of ours in @xcite .",
    "the tof of @xcite is used in fig .",
    "[ cm4 ] and the one obtained from the first calculation of the spectral function of @xcite in @xcite .",
    "the different treatment of the various theoretical ingredients produce significant numerical differences in the calculated cross sections .",
    "the contribution of nn - fsi to the final cross section is , however , of the same type and of about the same relevance as in @xcite . in particular , the considerable enhancement given by nn - fsi for medium and large values of the recoil momentum",
    "is confirmed in the present calculations .",
    "in contrast to the results of @xcite , where the enhancement at large @xmath39 is due the @xmath5-current contribution , in fig .",
    "[ cm4 ] it is essentially due to the ob current , which is always dominant in the cross section for all the values of the recoil momentum .    a different kinematical situation is considered in fig .",

    "the @xmath0o(e , e@xmath1pp)@xmath2c@xmath48 cross section displayed in the top panel is calculated with @xmath49 mev , @xmath50 , and @xmath41 mev , i.e. the same values as in the super - parallel kinematics . in this",
    "symmetrical kinematics , however , the cm effect included in the orthogonalized approach gives only small differences with respect to the previous result .",
    "the cross section is dominated by the ob current and , as in @xcite , it is not affected by the treatment of the @xmath5-current .",
    "it is , however , sensitive to the treatment of correlations in the tof @xcite .    the cross section of the @xmath0o(@xmath3,pp)@xmath2c@xmath48 reaction at an incident photon energy @xmath51 mev , displayed in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ cm5 ] , is dominated by the @xmath5-current .",

    "these effects produce a large increase of the contribution of the ob current and of the final cross section . in the region where the @xmath5-current is dominant",
    "the sensitivity of the results to the @xmath5-parametrization is the same as in @xcite , i.e.  very large .",
    "two basic aspects have been discussed within the frame of electromagnetic two - proton knockout reactions , i.e. cm effects and the spuriosity arising from the lacking orthogonality between initial and final state wave functions in connection with the usual treatments of the nuclear current .",
    "they have been investigated for the cross sections of the exclusive @xmath0o(e , e@xmath1pp)@xmath2c and @xmath0o(@xmath3,pp)@xmath2c reactions under the traditional conditions of super - parallel and symmetrical kinematics .",
    "different kinematics and transitions to discrete low - lying states of the residual nucleus are known to emphasize either the role of the one - body currents , and thus of correlations , or of the two - body @xmath5-current . since in two - nucleon knockout",
    "one is primarily interested in studying correlations , it is important to keep all the ingredients of the cross section under control in order to extract the useful information from data .    in our previous calculations of two - nucleon knockout",
    "not all the cm effects were properly taken into account . in the cm frame",
    "the transition operator becomes a two - body operator even in the case of a one - body nuclear current . as a consequence",
    ", the one - body current can give a contribution to the cross section of two - particle emission independently of correlations .",
    "this effect is similar to the one of the effective charges in electromagnetic reactions  @xcite .",
    "the effective transition operator entering the transition matrix element is in principle defined consistently with the two - body initial and final state wave functions derived from an energy - dependent non - hermitian hamiltonian . in such an approach , no spurious contribution comes from the orthogonality defect of the wave functions @xcite . in practice",
    ", however , one approximates the transition operator in terms of simple forms of one- and two - body currents , thus introducing some spuriosity . in the past , this spuriousity was cured by subtracting from the transition amplitude the contribution of the one - body current without correlations in the nuclear wave functions . in this way ,",
    "however , not only the spuriosity is subtracted , but also the cm effect given by the two - body operator which is present in the one - body current independently of correlations and which is not spurious .",
    "alternatively , one can enforce orthogonality between the initial and final states by means of a gram - schmidt orthogonalization .",
    "the two approaches have been investigated here and shown to give similar results .",
    "however , the gram - schmidt orthogonalization has been further used in the present investigation because it is preferable in principle and allows us to naturally include all the cm effects .",
    "the cm effects due to the one - body current without correlations are different in different situations and kinematics . for the @xmath0o(e , e@xmath1pp)@xmath2c@xmath4 reaction in the super - parallel kinematics",

    "the destructive interference between the one - body and the two - body @xmath5-current as well as the sensitivity to the treatment of the @xmath5-current discussed in @xcite are strongly reduced . with respect to the results of @xcite ,",
    "the calculated cross section is enhanced and seems to better reproduce the experimental data of @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "these cm effects are very sensitive to the treatment of the two - nucleon overlap function describing the initial correlated pair of protons .",
    "the mutual interaction between the two emerging protons produces a large enhancement of the cross section at medium and large recoil momenta .",
    "the effect is of the same type and of about the same relevance as in @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to the results of @xcite , where the enhancement at large @xmath39 is due the @xmath5-current contribution , when including cm effects it is essentially due to the one - body current , which is always dominant in the super - parallel cross section for all the values of the recoil momentum .    in the symmetrical kinematics the @xmath0o(e , e@xmath1pp)@xmath2c@xmath4 reaction is dominated by the one - body current and is thus sensitive to the treatment of correlations , confirming the result found in @xcite .",

    "the cm effects investigated in this work depend on kinematics and on the final state of the residual nucleus .",
    "the numerical examples shown in the present analysis indicate that these effects are particularly large for the @xmath0o(e , e@xmath1pp)@xmath2c@xmath4 reaction in the super - parallel kinematics of the mami experiment .",
    "the extreme sensitivity to the treatment of the different ingredients of the model and to different effects and contributions makes the super - parallel kinematics very interesting but also not particularly suitable to disentangle and investigate the specific contribution of short - range correlations .",
    "more and different situations should be considered to achieve this goal .",

    "<S> the role of center - of mass ( cm ) effects in the one - body nuclear current in the description of electromagnetically induced two - nucleon knockout reactions is discussed in connection with the problem of the lack of orthogonality between initial bound states and final scattering states obtained by the use of an energy - dependent optical model potential . </S>",
