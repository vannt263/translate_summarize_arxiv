    "jet production in neutral - current ( nc ) deep inelastic @xmath0 scattering ( dis ) provides a test of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) calculations and of the parametrisations of the proton parton densities ( pdfs ) .",
    "jet cross sections allow the determination of the fundamental parameter of qcd , the strong coupling constant @xmath2 , and help to constrain the parton densities in the proton .    up to leading order ( lo ) in @xmath2 , jet production in nc dis proceeds via the quark - parton model ( qpm ) ( @xmath3 , where @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) , boson - gluon fusion ( bgf ) ( @xmath6 ) and qcd - compton ( qcdc ) ( @xmath7 ) processes .",
    "the jet production cross section is given in pqcd by the convolution of the proton pdfs and the subprocess cross section , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the fraction of the proton s momentum taken by the interacting parton , @xmath10 are the proton pdfs , @xmath11 is the factorisation scale , @xmath12 is the subprocess cross section and @xmath13 is the renormalisation scale .",
    "all the data accumulated from hera and fixed - target experiments have allowed a good determination of the proton pdfs over a large phase space .",
    "then , measurements of jet production in neutral current dis provide accurate tests of pqcd and a determination of the fundamental parameter of the theory , @xmath2 .    at high scales , calculations using the dglap evolution equations",
    "have been found to give a good description of the data up to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) .",
    "therefore , by fitting the data with these calculations , it is possible to extract accurate values of @xmath2 and the gluon density of the proton .",
    "however , for scales of @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the jet transverse energy and @xmath16 is the exchanged photon virtuality , and large values of the jet pseudorapidity , @xmath17 , large discrepancies between the data and the nlo calculations have been observed at low @xmath9 .",
    "this could indicate a breakdown of the dglap evolution and the onset of bfkl effects .",
    "these discrepancies can also be explained by assigning a partonic structure to the exchanged virtual photon or a large contribution of higher order effects at low @xmath18 .",
    "inclusive jet cross sections have been measured  @xcite in the breit frame using the @xmath19-cluster algorithm in the longitudinally invariant mode .",
    "the measurements were made in the kinematic region given by @xmath20 2  and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the angle of the struck quark in the quark - parton model in the hera laboratory frame .",
    "the cross sections refer to jets of @xmath23 gev and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the jet transverse energy and pseudorapidity , respectively , in the breit frame .",
    "the use of inclusive jet cross sections in a qcd analysis presents several advantages : inclusive jet cross sections are infrared insensitive and better suited to test resummed calculations and the theoretical uncertainties are smaller than for dijet cross sections .",
    "figure  [ one ] shows the inclusive jet cross section as a function of @xmath18 and @xmath25 .",
    "the dots are the data and the error bars represent the statistical and systematic uncertainties ; the shaded band displays the uncertainty on the absolute energy scale of the jets .",
    "the measured cross sections have a steep fall - off , by five ( four ) orders of magnitude within the measured @xmath27 range .",
    "the lines are the nlo calculations using disent with different choices of the renormalisation scale ( @xmath28 or @xmath25 ) .",
    "the calculations describe reasonably well the @xmath18 and @xmath25 dependence of the cross section for @xmath29 2  and @xmath30 gev . at low @xmath18 and low @xmath25 ,",
    "the measurements are above the calculations by about @xmath31 , which is of the same size as the theoretical uncertainties ( see below ) .",
    "therefore , for the extraction of @xmath2 , the phase space was restricted to high @xmath18 and high @xmath25 .",

    "the uncertainty coming from the absolute energy scale of the jets is also small , @xmath32 .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties comprise @xmath33 from the absent higher orders , @xmath34 from the uncertainties of the proton pdfs and @xmath33 from the uncertainty in the value of @xmath1 assumed .",
    "the parton - to - hadron corrections are @xmath31 with an uncertainty of @xmath35 .",
    "the method  @xcite used by zeus to extract @xmath2 exploits the dependence of the nlo calculations on @xmath1 through the matrix elements ( @xmath36 ) and the proton pdfs ( @xmath1 value assumed in the evolution ) . to take into account properly this correlation",
    ", nlo calculations were performed using various sets of pdfs which assumed different values of @xmath1 .",
    "the calculations were then parametrised as a function of @xmath1 in each measured @xmath18 or @xmath25 region . from the measured value of the cross section as a function of @xmath18 in each region of @xmath18 ,",
    "a value of @xmath1 and its uncertainty were extracted using the parametrisations of the nlo calculations .    from the inclusive jet cross section for @xmath29 2 ,",
    "the value @xmath37 was extracted using the method explained above .",
    "the experimental uncertainties are dominated by the uncertainty on the absolute energy scale of the jets ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties are : @xmath34 from the absent higher orders , @xmath35 from the pdfs and @xmath38 from the hadronisation corrections .",
    "this determination is compatible with other independent extractions performed at hera and with the current world average ( see figure  [ two]a ) .",
    "further precision in the extraction of @xmath1 from inclusive jet cross sections depends upon further experimental and theoretical improvements .",

    "the result , shown in figure  [ two]b ( triangles ) , is compatible with the running of @xmath2 as predicted by qcd ( shaded band ) over a large range in the scale .",
    "figure  [ two]b also shows other studies of the energy - scale dependence of @xmath2 from hera : all the results are compatible with each other and with the qcd prediction .",
    "this constitutes a test of the scale dependence of @xmath2 between @xmath40 and @xmath41 gev .",
    "dijet data in dis may be used to gain insight into the parton dynamics at low @xmath9 .",
    "the evolution of the pdfs with the factorisation scale can be described by the dglap evolution equations which sum the leading powers of terms like @xmath42 in the region of strongly ordered transverse momenta @xmath19 .",
    "this presciption describes successfully jet production at high @xmath18 .",
    "however , the dglap approximation is expected to break down at low @xmath9 since when @xmath43 , the terms proportional to @xmath44 become important and need to be summed .",
    "this is done in the bfkl evolution equations ; the integration is taken over the full @xmath19 phase space of the gluons with no @xmath19-ordering .",
    "another approach , the ccfm evolution equations with angular - ordered parton emission , is equivalent to the bfkl approach for @xmath45 and reproduces the dglap evolution equations at large @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the properties of the dijet system , which depend on the dynamics of the ladder , can be studied to determine whether the cascade has a @xmath19-ordered or unordered evolution .",
    "deviations from the dglap approach at small @xmath9 can be tested experimentally . at small @xmath9",
    "it is expected that parton emission along the exchanged gluon ladder should increase with decreasing @xmath9 . a clear experimental signature of this effect would be that the two outgoing hard partons are no longer back - to - back and so an excess of events at small azimuthal separations should be observed .",
    "values of the azimuthal separation of the two hard jets in the @xmath46 centre - of - mass frame , @xmath47 , different than @xmath48 can occur in the dglap approach only when higher order contributions are included . on the other hand , in the bfkl and ccfm approaches , the number of events with @xmath49 should increase due to the partons entering the hard process with large @xmath19 .      to test the predictions of the different approaches ,",
    "dijet cross sections have been measured  @xcite using the @xmath19-cluster algorithm in the longitudinally inclusive mode in the @xmath50 centre - of - mass frame .",
    "the measurements were made in the kinematic region given by @xmath51 2  and @xmath52 .",
    "the cross sections refer to jets of @xmath53 gev , @xmath54 and @xmath55 gev , where @xmath56 is the jet transverse energy in the @xmath50 centre - of - mass frame .",
    "( 10.0,9.6 ) ( 0.0,0.5 ) ( 8.0,0.1 ) ( 3.5,0.0)*(a ) * ( 11.7,0.0)*(b ) *    figure  [ three]a shows the measured dijet distribution as a function of @xmath47 .",
    "a significant fraction of events is observed at a small azimuthal separation .",
    "since a measurement of a multi - differential cross section as a function of @xmath9 , @xmath18 and @xmath47 would be very difficult due to large migrations , the fraction of the number of dijet events with an azimuthal separation between @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath58 was taken as @xmath59 , was measured instead .",
    "the fraction @xmath60 , defined as @xmath61 is better suited to test small-@xmath9 effects than a triple differential cross section .",
    "the measured fraction @xmath60 as a function of bjorken @xmath9 in different regions of @xmath18 is presented in figure  [ three]b . the data rise towards low @xmath9 values , especially at low @xmath18 .",
    "the nlo predictions from disent , which contain @xmath19 effects only in the first order corrections , are several standard deviations below the data and show no dependence with @xmath9 . on the other hand , the predictions of nlojet , which contain @xmath19 effects at next - to - lowest order , provide an accurate description of the data at large @xmath18 and large @xmath9 .",
    "however , they fail to describe the increase of the data towards low @xmath9 values , especially at low @xmath18 .",
    "( 10.0,10.5 ) ( -0.4,0.2 ) ( 8.5,0.2 ) ( 3.7,0.0)*(a ) * ( 12.7,0.0)*(b ) *    figure  [ four]a shows the data compared with the predictions of rapgap with direct only and resolved plus direct processes .",
    "a good description of the data is obtained at large @xmath18 and large @xmath9 .",
    "however , there is a failure to describe the strong rise of the data towards low @xmath9 , especially at low @xmath18 , even when including a possible contribution from resolved virtual photon processes , though the description in other regions is improved .",
    "if the observed discrepancies are due to the influence of non - ordered parton emissions , models based on the color dipole or the ccfm evolution could provide a better description of the data .",
    "figure  [ four]b shows the data compared with ariadne ( dotted lines ) and two predictions of cascade which use different sets of unintegrated parton distributions .",
    "these sets differ in the way the small-@xmath19 region is treated : in jung2003 the full splitting function , i.e. including the non - singular term , is used in contrast to js2001 , for which only the singular term was considered .",
    "the predictions of ariadne give a good description of the data at low @xmath9 and @xmath18 , but fail to describe the data at high @xmath18 .",
    "the predictions of cascade using js2001 lie significantly above the data in all @xmath9 and @xmath18 regions , whereas those using jung2003 are closer to the data .",
    "therefore , the measurement of the fraction @xmath60 is sensitive to the details of the unintegrated parton distributions .",
    "the investigation of the internal structure of jets gives insight into the transition between a parton produced in a hard process and the experimentally observable jet of hadrons .",
    "the internal structure of a jet depends mainly on the type of primary parton from which it originated and to a lesser extent on the particular hard scattering process .",
    "qcd predicts that at sufficiently high @xmath15 , where fragmentation effects become negligible , the jet structure is driven by gluon emission off the primary parton and is then calculable in pqcd .",
    "the lowest non - trivial order contribution to the jet substructure is given by order @xmath62 calculations .",
    "the internal structure of the jets can be studied by means of the mean subjet multiplicity .",
    "subjets are resolved within a jet by reapplying the @xmath19 algorithm on all particles belonging to the jet until for every pair of particles the quantity @xmath63 is above @xmath64 .",
    "all remaining clusters are called subjets .",
    "the subjet structure depends upon the value chosen for the resolution parameter @xmath65 .",
    "the mean subjet multiplicity has been measured  @xcite for jets using the @xmath19 algorithm in the hera laboratory frame with @xmath15 above 15 gev and @xmath66 , in the kinematic range given by @xmath20 2 .",
    "figure  [ five]a shows the mean subjet multiplicity for a fixed value of @xmath65 of @xmath67 as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "it decreases as @xmath15 increases , i.e. the jets become more collimated .",
    "the experimental uncertainties are small ( fragmentation model uncertainty @xmath68 , the uncertainty on the absolute energy scale of the jets is negligible ) .",
    "the detector and hadronisation corrections are @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively , for @xmath71 gev .",
    "the data are compared to the lo and nlo predictions of disent .",
    "the lo calculation fails to describe the data , whereas the nlo calculations provide a good description .",
    "these measurements are sensitive to @xmath2 and have been used to extract a value of @xmath1 .",
    "the result is @xmath72 this value is compatible with the world average and with previous measurements ( see figure  [ two]a ) .",
    "( 10.0,10.7 ) ( -0.2,-0.3 ) ( 8.4,0.2 ) ( 4.2,0.0)*(a ) * ( 13.2,0.0)*(b ) *",
    "a complementary extraction of @xmath2 , also using the details of the hadronic final state in dis , comes from the study of the event shape variables , like thrust or jet broadening .",
    "event shape variables are particularly sensitive to the details of the non - perturbative effects of hadronisation and can be used to test the models for these effects .",
    "recently , new developments with regard to power - law corrections have prompted a revived interest in the understanding of hadronisation from first principles . in this type of analysis ,",
    "the data are compared to model predictions which combine nlo calculations and the theoretical expectations of the power corrections , which are characterised by an effective coupling @xmath73 .",
    "previous results supported the concept of power corrections in the approach of dokshitzer  but a large spread of the results suggested that higher order corrections were needed .",
    "now , resummed nll calculations matched to nlo are available and so it is possible to study event shape distributions instead of only their mean values .    event shape distributions ( thrust , jet broadening , the jet mass @xmath74 and the c parameter ) have been measured  @xcite for particles in the current hemisphere in the kinematic region given by @xmath75 gev and @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the inelasticity variable . predictions consisting of nlo calculations using disaster++ , resummed calculations matched to nlo and power corrections have been fitted to the data , leaving @xmath2 and @xmath73 as free parameters .",
    "a good description of the data by the predictions was obtained at high @xmath18 , though the description at low @xmath18 was poorer .",
    "figure  [ five]b shows the @xmath78-contour results from the fit in the @xmath2-@xmath73 plane .",
    "the spread observed in previous studies is much reduced when the resummed calculations are included .",
    "a clear anti - correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath73 is found for all variables .",
    "a universal value for @xmath73 of @xmath79 at the @xmath31 level was obtained , in agreement with the previous results , but with a smaller spread .",
    "there is still a sizeable theoretical uncertainty for both @xmath2 and @xmath73 , of the order of @xmath33 , which is as large as the experimental uncertainties .",
    "this uncertainty comes from the absent higher order corrections .",
    "hera has become a unique qcd - testing machine due to the fact that at large scales considerable progress in understanding and reducing the experimental and theoretical uncertainties has led to very precise measurements of the fundamental parameter of the theory , the strong coupling constant @xmath2 .",
    "the use of observables resulting from jet algorithms leads now to determinations that are as precise as those coming from more inclusive measurements , such as from @xmath80 decays . to obtain even better accuracy in the determination of qcd , further improvements in the qcd calculations",
    "are needed , e.g. next - to - next - to - leading - order corrections .    at low values of @xmath9 and @xmath18 ,",
    "considerable progress has also been obtained in understanding the mechanisms of parton emission , though the interplay between the dglap , bfkl and ccfm evolution schemes has still to be fully worked out .",
    "further progress in this respect needs both more experimental and more theoretical work .",
    "i would like to thank the organisers for providing a warm atmosphere conducive to many physics discussions and a well organised conference .",
    "special thanks to my colleagues from h1 and zeus for their help in preparing this report ."
