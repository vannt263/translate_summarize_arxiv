    "note , however , that the timelike coordinate @xmath64 of the interior metric ranges from @xmath65 to @xmath66 , unlike the usual radial coordinate @xmath7 .",

    "purely mathematically , the nonsingular vacuum solution with parameter @xmath72 can be considered to be a `` regularization '' of part of the singular vacuum solution , with all the surprises this may entail .",
    "it is , however , also possible that this nonsingular solution appears in a physical context .",
    "start from a nearly flat spacetime ( metric approximately equal to the minkowski metric and trivial topology @xmath0 ) , where a large amount of matter with total mass @xmath40 is arranged to collapse in a spherically symmetric way . within the realm of classical einstein gravity , one expects to end up with part of the singular solution",

    "32.1.b of ref .  .",

    "34.6 , 43.4 , and 44.3 of ref .   and references therein ) , the local topology of the manifold may change by a quantum jump if @xmath32 is sufficiently close to the planck length @xmath89 , resulting in a transition from a simply - connected manifold to a nonsimply - connected manifold .",
    "if the transition amplitude between the different topologies is indeed nonzero for appropriate matter content , quantum mechanics can operate a change between the classical solution and the classical solution , thereby removing the curvature singularity .",
    "the flat spacetime metric for the case @xmath85 and @xmath90 does not describe a smooth lorentzian manifold . there is no diffeomorphism ( invertible one - to - one @xmath91 function ) which maps the spacetime near @xmath53 to a part of minkowski spacetime .",
    "the same holds for the general case , @xmath92 and @xmath90 .",
    "this violation of the elementary - flatness condition appears to be one of the surprises from the `` regularization , '' as mentioned in the fourth paragraph of sec .",
