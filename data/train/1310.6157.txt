    "metals and alloys under laser and particle irradiation are typical examples of nonequilibrium systems manifesting self - organization processes of point defects with nano - size patterns forming a corresponding microstructure .",
    "it is well known that depending on irradiation conditions ( displacement damage rate and temperature ) point defects can arrange into objects of higher dimension like clusters ( di- , tri- , tetra - vacancy clusters ) , defect walls with vacancy and interstitial loops @xcite , voids @xcite , precipitates @xcite , bubble lattices @xcite . patterns with spatial structures of nano - meter size can be observed as in a bulk as on a surface of irradiated materials , for example , at ion - beam sputtering @xcite , condensation from gaseous phase @xcite and molecular beam epitaxy @xcite .",
    "theoretical and experimental investigations of such dissipative structures are widely discussed in literature @xcite .",
    "numerical studies of defect clusters formation allow one to set up conditions for different kind of patterns emerging in diffusion processes and in processes of defects interaction @xcite .",
    "a production of defects and the resulting microstructure can principally modify the physical and mechanical properties of an irradiated material leading to swelling , hardening and embrittlement @xcite . therefore , from practical and theoretical viewpoints a study of microstructure of material , defects and their arrangement into clusters is a quite urgent problem in modern material science and statistical physics .    according to the standard theory of defects production ( see refs.@xcite ) a formation of point defects is of thermo - fluctuation character ; the probability of such processes grows with temperature and irradiation flux .",
    "it can be realized also at large defects density due to activation barrier height change for defect formation related to elastic deformation of the medium caused by defects presence .",
    "it is known that the thermo - fluctuation mechanism for defects generation plays a central role in a structural disorder formation . in this case",
    "a concentration of defects exceeds their equilibrium concentration by several orders ( concentration of nonequilibrium vacancies is @xmath3 ) .",
    "these defects can migrate in solid , annihilate , collapse into loops or interact with other defects forming spatial dissipative structures .",
    "the last one is possible beyond some threshold defined by material properties and irradiation conditions .",
    "in such a case a uniform distribution of defects becomes unstable due to their self - organization .",
    "as far as a formation of organized defect clusters requires the production of defects in cascades the corresponding microstructure was observed under neutron or ion irradiation .",
    "experimentally ( see , for example ref.@xcite ) it was shown that under @xmath4 protons irradiation at low doses ( @xmath5 ) a distribution of stacking fault tetrahedrons in @xmath6 and @xmath7 is homogeneous , whereas at elevated doses ( @xmath8 ) fluctuations of point defect clusters were observed . at doses up to @xmath9",
    "one gets well periodic structure of defect clusters .",
    "moreover , as was shown in ref.@xcite vacancy clusters in the form of stacking fault tetrahedra can be formed from collision cascades at low temperatures when vacancies do not make their motion by thermal activation .",
    "formation of stacking fault tetrahedron was experimentally observed even under electron irradiation of foils @xcite .",
    "it was shown that vacancy clusters in electron irradiated metals , appear under the circumstances of local enrichment of vacancies as the result of the behavior of interstitials atoms . in experimental studies",
    "vacancy clusters have linear size on several nano - meters ( in the interval @xmath10 depending on irradiation conditions and used material target ) with @xmath11 vacancies inside clusters @xcite .",
    "understanding of the defect population dynamics and microstructure transformations is thus of fundamental importance , not for its intrinsic interest , but also for its technological significance .",
    "it allows one to describe macroscopic ordering processes , phase separation in solids under different conditions of external influence @xcite . despite the main mechanisms of radiation damage in solids",
    "are known @xcite nowadays multiscale approaches treating the system under consideration at different hierarchical levels ( from atomic to mesoscopic level ) are used to study microstructure transformation in irradiated materials @xcite . on a mesoscopic level such processes can be studied within the framework of a rate theory where concentrations / densities of main structural elements ( defects , their clusters , sinks ) are considered @xcite .",
    "usually such models take into account defects production rate , their annihilation and diffusion of mobile species ( vacancies and interstitials ) @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , a generation of defects caused by elastic deformation of the medium and their interactions caused by `` chemical '' forces are not considered as usual . moreover , as far as irradiation occurs at elevated temperatures ( depending on the irradiation conditions , namely , dose rate @xmath12 and temperature @xmath13 ) fluctuations of defects production lead to stochastic dynamics of defect populations",
    ". properties of stochastic defects production in irradiated materials and stochastic formation of stacking fault tetrahedrons ( vacancy clusters ) were discussed in refs.@xcite .",
    "a stochastic production of defects during irradiation influence was proposed in ref.@xcite , where it was assumed that the corresponding stochastic athermal mixing of atoms caused by irradiation can be described as spatially correlated random process giving the effective flux opposite to the diffusion one .",
    "this idea was exploited studying ordering , patterning and phase separation in irradiated materials @xcite .",
    "in such a case the corresponding fluctuations are caused by an external influence ( energy dispersion of particles in irradiation flux , dispersion in an incidence angle , etc . ) and are considered as an external noise . from the other hand in systems with birth - and - death processes or `` chemical reactions '' ( production of defects and their annihilation ) and diffusion there is another kind of fluctuation source relevant to internal nature of the system .",
    "the corresponding internal noise is defined by a heat bath .",
    "its influence on arrangement of ensemble of vacancies was studied theoretically in refs.@xcite , where it was shown that depending on internal noise properties different kinds of vacancy structures emerge .    from both theoretical and practical viewpoints it is important that dynamics of defects and , therefore , the corresponding microstructure are quite different at conditions relevant to irradiation in reactors ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) and in accelerators ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) . under reactor conditions the principal role belongs to diffusion processes , whereas irradiation in accelerators gives high damage rates with small contribution of diffusion processes .",
    "it results in different spatial arrangement of defects in these two cases .",
    "therefore , the studying different physical processes of defects arrangement in irradiated materials under different irradiation conditions is actual . in this paper",
    "we are aimed to study dynamics of defects at their self - organization under reactor and accelerator conditions considering behavior of point defects and their sinks . using the approach proposed in ref.@xcite we take into account defects production caused by local elastic deformation of material and stochastic effects induced by external noise influence . in our study pure @xmath6 ( as most wide - spread constructional material in atomic energy )",
    "was selected as a reference system .",
    "we will show that the external noise influence can be different in the case of irradiation under reactor and accelerator conditions . in the first case it promotes large difference in vacancy clusters occupation numbers comparing to the second case .",
    "moreover , it is able to reduce the linear size of vacancy clusters and a period of their arrangement",
    ". it will be shown that both linear size of vacancy clusters and their period are of several nano - meter range .",

    "ii we present a generalized model describing the main mechanisms of defects formation with two spatial scales related to diffusion scale and defects interaction scale . in section iii we consider a reduced one - component model analytically assuming constant sink densities . here",

    "it means that homogeneous distribution of defects starting from some critical speed of its formation related to the temperature , sinks density , and dilatation volume becomes unstable .",
    "the emergence of the directional flux of defects results in supersaturation of vacancies and formation of clusters or pores . from mathematical viewpoint",
    "such divergence appeared at short time scales can not be compensated by nonlinear part of the reaction terms .",
    "the second term in expansion ( [ expansionu ] ) can prevent divergencies of the derived model due to microscopic properties of defect interactions .",
