    "bulk and thin films of alkali metals containing 3@xmath1 transition metal ( tm ) impurities have been studied experimentally for quite some time now  @xcite .",
    "the most intriguing property of these systems is the large magnetic moment they posses .",
    "beckmann and bergmann  @xcite , through anomalous hall measurements , show that a co impurity on a cs film has a ( total ) magnetic moment as large as 9 @xmath2 , and that in bulk cs has a moment of 8 @xmath2 .",
    "an fe impurity has a moment of 7 @xmath2 both on a cs film , and inside bulk cs .",
    "bergmann and song  @xcite predicted large moments in v doped alkali metals which ranged from 6 - 7 @xmath2 in a na host to 4 @xmath2 in a cs host .",
    "nearly two decades ago , riegel _ et al_.  @xcite and kowallik _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , through magnetic susceptibility measurements , showed that fe and ni impurities in k , rb and cs hosts have large magnetic moments .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in their x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) and x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) measurements find total magnetic moments of 6.63 @xmath2 , 5.59 @xmath2 , and 3.55 @xmath2 respectively for fe , co and ni impurities on k films .",
    "these startling findings raise the obvious question of the origin of such large magnetic moments . and",
    "that is where opinions differ .",
    "riegel and co - workers  @xcite argued that the tm atoms remain isolated inside an alkali host due to the latter s rather large lattice constant .",
    "this isolated nature of the tm atoms retain their atomic spin and orbital moments , which are , otherwise , quenched in a solid environment due to hybridization and crystal - field effects .",
    "the moments are , therefore , essentially those of isolated tm atoms .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite also subscribe to this view . comparing their observed xas spectra with the calculated ones ,",
    "they show that the tm atoms are indeed in their atomic configurations .",
    "beckmann and bergmann  @xcite and bergmann and song  @xcite , on the other hand have argued that the only way to explain the observed moments in the tm - alkali metal systems is to assume that the electrons in the alkali host are polarized in presence of the tm atoms .",
    "this is exactly how an fe impurity behaves in a pd host , where it polarizes the pd electrons leading to a giant moment  @xcite .",
    "tm - alkali metal systems have been studied theoretically also .",
    "and the picture that emerges supports riegel _",
    "et al_. and gambardella _",
    "et al_. s views . through local density approximation ( lda ) plus local coulomb energy ( @xmath3 ) calculations within the density functional ( dft )",
    "theory , kwon and min  @xcite have shown that an fe impurity behaves differently in a cs host compared to a pd host .",
    "there is no polarization of the cs electrons , rather the fe impurity remains isolated leading to atomic - like large moments .",
    "sahu and kleinman  @xcite performed dft calculations for v impurities in bulk na , and co in na and k. they also rejected the hypothesis that polarization of the host electrons is responsible for the observed moment .    in support of their proposition , bergmann and co - workers cited okazaki and teraoka s  @xcite work . in this , the authors use a uniform jellium model ( ujm ) of finite thickness to study electronic and magnetic properties of alkali metal thin films . using local spin density approximation ( lsda ) for the exchange - correlation functional , they find that depending on the electron density @xmath4 ( equivalently @xmath5 ) , the ujm can have a ferromagnetic ground state in certain ranges of thickness ( @xmath6 ) . in a later detailed work",
    "@xcite , they show that for @xmath7 , paramagnetic ( pm ) and fully polarized ferromagnetic ( fpf ) solutions exist at every thickness .",
    "they also find partially polarized ferromagnetic ( ppf ) solutions for @xmath8 , and @xmath9 bohr , and antiferromagnetic ( af ) solutions for @xmath10 bohr .",
    "the ground state of the system turns out to be fpf at @xmath11 bohr , pm for @xmath12 bohr , ppf at @xmath13 bohr , fpf at @xmath14 bohr , ppf at @xmath15 bohr , pm for @xmath16 bohr , ppf at @xmath17 bohr , and pm at @xmath18 bohr .",
    "based on these results , very thin films of cs and rb are expected to be ferromagnetic  @xcite .    in order to throw further light on this debate , it becomes crucial to understand the electronic and magnetic structures of specific alkali metal thin films through first - principles atomistic calculations ( as opposed to the ujm ) .",
    "in particular , one needs to address the question : are thin films of alkali metals , in particular cs , really ferromagnetic ? for this purpose ,",
    "i have done dft calculations for k and cs thin films using both lsda and gga .",
    "the main results in this brief report are : for most thicknesses , alkali metal thin films do not have a fm state ; only a 6 layer cs film has a fm state , which , however , is degenerate with the pm state . the numerical methods employed and the results obtained are discussed in detail in the next two sections .",
    "calculations were performed within the framework of dft .",
    "vasp  @xcite was used for all the calculations .",
    "the wave functions are expressed in a plane wave basis set with an energy cutoff of 400 ev .",
    "the brillouin zone integrations are performed using the monkhorst - pack scheme .",
    "ionic potentials are represented by paw .",
    "both lsda and pw91 gga functionals are used for the exchange - correlation energy . the preconditioned conjugate gradient method as implemented in vasp",
    "is used for wave function optimization , and the conjugate gradient is used for ionic relaxation . k@xmath0 and cs@xmath0 thin films",
    "are represented by a repeated slab geometry .",
    "each slab contains the desired number of @xmath0 planes of the alkali metal . in the starting geometry ,",
    "the atoms in the films were placed at their bulk positions .",
    "values of the bulk lattice constant used were calculated with the particular method ( lda or gga ) in use . for the bcc bulk k , the lattice constants obtained were 5.04    and 5.28    respectively using lda and gga . for bcc cs , the corresponding values turned out to be 5.77    and 6.13    respectively .",
    "the experimental lattice constants for k and cs are 5.23    and 6.05    respectively .",
    "consecutive slabs were separated by a vacuum space equal to 6 atomic layers . for 1 , 2 and 3 layer films ,",
    "a @xmath19 surface supercell was used .",
    "however , there were no forces on any of the atoms along the @xmath0 planes .",
    "therefore , for thicker films , a @xmath20 surface supercell was used to reduce computational cost .",
    "only one of the atoms in the supercell was held fixed , and all other atoms were allowed relax freely in all three directions without any symmetry constraints . as already mentioned , there were no forces , and hence no movement of the atoms in the @xmath0 planes .",
    "relaxation perpendicular to the @xmath0 planes were also rather small .",
    "a @xmath21 k - point mesh was used for @xmath19 surface supercell , while for the @xmath20 surface supercell , a @xmath22 k - point mesh was used . absolute convergence of energy with respect to energy cutoff and the number of k points was thoroughly tested .",
    "similar methods were used earlier to study thin al@xmath23 films by ciraci and batra  @xcite .",
    "calculations were done for 3 , 5 and 7 layer k films , and for cs films having thicknesses from 1 to 7 atomic layers .",
    "i searched for both paramagnetic and ferromagnetic ( fm ) solutions for both k and cs films at each thickness .",
    "i do not consider afm states , since ref .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite do not find an afm ground state at any thickness . while searching for a fm state , the initial hamiltonian was set up with a spin moment of 2 @xmath2 on each atom . in almost all cases the films converged to pm states with zero or a vanishingly small moment ( which is probably a remanent of the initial hamiltonian ) .",
    "the only exception was a 6 layer cs film for which a small moment of @xmath24 @xmath2 per atom was found in both lsda and gga . in order to be convinced",
    "that it is , in fact , a ferromagnetic state , i plot the band structures and the electronic densities of states ( dos ) in figure .",
    "[ fig : bandos ] for a 6 layer cs film . as is clearly seen , the minority ( down ) spin bands",
    "are slightly shifted up in energy compared to the majority ( up ) spin bands .",
    "this is reflected in the dos as well .",
    "it should also be noted that i obtain a staircase - like dos expected for a quasi - two dimensional system of electrons , as discussed in detail in ref .  @xcite . since in all films except a 6 layer film of cs ,",
    "the initial fm films converge to a pm state , the energies in the two states are the same .",
    "this and other results are listed in tables  [ table : klda ] to  [ table : csgga ] . the binding energy per atom for an @xmath25 atom film given in these tables are defined as follows .",
    "@xmath26 where @xmath27 is the energy of an isolated alkali metal atom , and @xmath28 is the total energy of a film containing @xmath25 alkali metal atoms .",
    "interestingly , even in 6 layer cs films , the energies of the pm and fm states are identical in lsda , and differs by only 1 mev per atom in gga .",
    "this energy difference , however , is at the limit of accuracy of the present dft based methods .",
    "therefore , we can only claim that a 6 layer cs film has degenerate pm and fm ground states .",
    ".thickness (  ) and binding energy ( be , ev / atom ) of k@xmath0 films containing specified number of atomic layers .",
    "results for pm(fm ) states are obtained using lda(lsda ) . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     while k - films are not expected to be ferromagnetic , as one requires thinner films for metals with smaller @xmath29 to find a fm state according to ref .",
    "@xcite , i do not find any ( unique ) fm ground state for cs films either .",
    "in fact , i do not even find a fm state except for a 6 layer cs film .",
    "a few points are in order here .",
    "1 . in the finite - thickness ujm that okazaki and teraoka have considered , thickness is a continuous variable , but for a real metal film , it can only take discrete values determined by the number of atomic layers in the film . comparing with the lsda results of ref .",
    "@xcite , cs films with 2 layers ( thickness of 3.21   @xmath30 bohr ) and 4 layers ( thickness 8.93   @xmath31 bohr ) are expected to be fpf and ppf respectively .",
    "however , both these are found to be paramagnetic in my calculations . a 6 layer film ( thickness 14.63   @xmath32 bohr ) is found to have a fm state , albeit with a small moment , while a finite thickness ujm is expected to be pm beyond a thickness of 25.6 bohr .",
    "2 . even in okazaki and teraoka s calculations",
    "@xcite , the energy difference between a pm and a fm state is rather small , @xmath33mev ( fig . 4 of ref .",
    "their calculations are also based on the local density and local spin density approximations of the dft .",
    "therefore , it would be difficult to argue in favor of a fm ground state on the basis of those calculations , though , admittedly , they found a definite trend at @xmath34 and @xmath35 with varying @xmath29 .",
    "the present calculations also bring out the importance of doing an atomistic first - principles calculation , the results of which differ significantly from those of a model system studied in refs .",
    "in conclusion , through first - principles atomistic calculation using plane - wave paw formalism within lsda and gga of the dft , i show that neither k nor cs films can be claimed to have a ( unique ) fm ground state within the accuracy of these calculations .",
    "only a 6 layer cs film has a fm ground state , but that is degenerate with a pm state .",
    "present work points out that there are crucial differences in the behavior of a ujm and a real atomistic system .",
    "more accurate calculations , such as quantum monte carlo , may be required to resolve the issue of ferromagnetism in alkali metal thin films .",
    "i would like to end by pointing out that these results , by themselves , do not rule out the possibility of polarization of electrons in an alkali metal film in presence of tm impurities ( though that also has been argued against in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite ) , but definitely show that within lsda and gga , one can not claim alkali metal thin films to have a fm ground state .",
    "numerical calculations for this study were carried out at the cluster computing facility in the harish - chandra research institute ( http://cluster.mri.ernet.in ) .",
