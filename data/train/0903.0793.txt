    "three decades of study of blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies has led to a preliminary understanding of their content and evolution . some of the key results have been summarized by @xcite : +    1 .",
    "bcds are dwarfs currently undergoing a strong burst of star formation ( sf ) whose optical light is dominated by emission from hot young stars .",
    "2 .   since star forming regions in bcds",
    "are unusually bright , it becomes difficult to assign morphological types to the underlying hosts .",
    "but currently there has been substantial evidence that the underlying host is a dwarf irregular galaxy whose radial profiles are exponential at least at large radii ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "spectra of the bcds are dominated by nebular emission superimposed on the featureless continua of o and b stars .",
    "the emission - line dominated spectra permit an accurate determination of elemental abundances of the emitting gas .",
    "it has also been well established that bcds are not very young systems forming stars for the first time ; rather they all possess an older underlying population of stars which confirms that bcds began forming stars long ago ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "bcds are deficient in co @xcite , but this does not necessarily imply a lack of h@xmath7 .",
    "it has also been suggested that co and even h@xmath7 might have been destroyed in the extreme , compact environments of bcds . clearly more observations are required in this regard .",
    "there are still many questions which need special attention .",
    "there are a few speculations which need to be resolved :    1 .",
    "it is not yet clear what initially triggers the burst of star formation .",
    "gravitational instabilities , random cloud collisions in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , tidal interactions , collisions with other galaxies , ism stripping and cooling flow accretion in specific galaxies are some of the star formation triggers as reviewed by @xcite .",
    "once a burst has occurred , it can be sustained and regulated by the underlying stellar distribution through shock waves from winds and supernova explosions of massive stars ( @xcite , @xcite ) which was generalized by @xcite as self - propagating stochastic star formation ( spssf ) .",
    "the major issue concerns the evolution of a dwarf galaxy ( @xcite , @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "have shown that all gas - rich dwarf galaxies do not go through one or more bcd like episodes to end as gas poor dwarf ellipticals .",
    "rather , a special subsample of the dwarf galaxy population can host a starburst of the magnitude that would qualify it as a bcd .",
    "milder star bursts observed in these epochs may not be effective in expelling the gas so as to change a galaxy s morphological classification .",
    "in fact , the morphology of a dwarf galaxy is largely set by its enveloping dark halo @xcite .    in this paper , we have taken up a task to study the star formation properties and star formation history of two very different bcds : mkn 104 and i zw 97 , using broad band @xmath8@xmath9@xmath10@xmath11@xmath12 photometry , narrow band h@xmath6 imaging and medium resolution spectroscopy of the intense star forming regions .",
    "i zw 97 resembles a cometary bcd .",
    "rc3 ( third reference catalogue of bright galaxies,@xcite ) reports a redshift of 0.008399 with heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath13 kms@xmath2 and the distance to this galaxy is calculated to be 34.5 mpc ( h@xmath14 = 73 kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 ) .",
    "the morphological type of the underlying faint low surface brightness galaxy has not been classified .",
    "this galaxy does not belong to any catalogued group and has no nearby neighbours .",
    "mkn 104 differs from i zw 97 in its environment .",
    "it is classified to be a member of a group , uzc - cg 94 ( @xcite , @xcite ) consisting of three members .",
    "ugc 4906 , a sa type galaxy , is the nearest ( @xmath15 distance ) neighbour to mkn 104 .",
    "the heliocentric velocity of mkn 104 is @xmath16 kms@xmath2 ( 2004 sdss data release 2 ; from ned ) and the distance to this galaxy is estimated to be 30.62 mpc ( h@xmath14 = 73 kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that mkn 104 contains double nuclei in the merging phase ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite have shown that both the nuclei exhibit h ii region like spectra .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "section 2 of the paper deals with observations and data reduction .",
    "section 3 and 4 deal with the results and star formation history of the two galaxies and finally section 5 concludes the study .",
    "i zw 97 and mkn 104 were observed using the 2 m himalayan chandra telescope , of the indian astronomical observatory , hanle , india , which is remotely operated from the center for research and education in science and technology ( crest ) , iia , bangalore .",
    "images of these galaxies were taken through bessell s broad band @xmath8@xmath9@xmath10@xmath11@xmath12 and narrow band h@xmath6 ( bw=100  ) filters , using the central 2k@xmath172k region of a 2k@xmath174k site ccd ( plate scale @xmath18 per pixel ) installed in the hfosc system ( himalaya faint object spectrograph and camera , http://www.iiap.res.in/iao.html ) .",
    "imaging observations were done under photometric sky conditions .",
    "the seeing at @xmath9 band ranged 1@xmath198 to 2@xmath192 ( see table [ t1 ] ) .",
    "medium resolution spectra of a few of the bright star forming regions of the galaxies were obtained using a @xmath20 slit ( # 167l ) with a grism ( # 7 ) providing coverage of 3800 - 6700   with a dispersion of 1.46  / pixel .",
    "the spectral resolution was @xmath21 kms@xmath2 ( @xmath22  ) fwhm at the central wavelength of 5340  .",
    "the centres of the star forming regions were determined using images taken through h@xmath6 filter , which is an excellent indicator of strong star formation .",
    "spectra were then obtained by aligning the slit at the centre of these star forming regions .",
    "data reduction was done using the standard tasks available within iraf which includes bias subtraction , flat fielding , cosmic rays removal , aligning of the frames and finally aperture photometry of the star forming regions .",
    "the observed frames were calibrated using the standard fields of @xcite observed on the same night .",
    "spectroscopic reduction included bias subtraction , flat fielding , extraction of the one dimensional spectra , wavelength calibration using the ferrous argon arc lamp spectrum and flux calibration using spectrophotometric standards .",
    "standard stars feige 34 and feige 67 were used to flux calibrate spectra of the star forming regions of mkn 104 and standard star hz 44 was used to flux calibrate i zw 97 spectra .",
    "a log of observations is presented in table [ t1 ] .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the @xmath9 band and h@xmath6 narrow band images of i zw 97 and mkn 104 , respectively .",
    "figure 3 shows the spectra of a few star forming regions that are numbered in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "h@xmath6 line images were obtained by subtracting the scaled @xmath11 band image from the h@xmath6 image following the procedure suggested by @xcite .",
    "figures 1(b ) and 2(b ) show the continuum subtracted h@xmath6 images of the two galaxies .",
    "i zw 97 shows two strong star forming regions numbered as knots k1 and k2 and three other faint star forming regions ( knots k3 , k4 and k5 ) spread over the face of the galaxy .",
    "the h@xmath6 image of i zw 97 is particularly interesting , as four of the five star forming regions are arranged in a cometary structure , with the brightest knot k1 situated at the south - western end .",
    "knot k3 is near the centre of this galaxy and it is very faint , indicating very little star formation .",
    "the brightest knot , labeled here as k1 , is at a distance of 1.6 kpc ( @xmath23 corresponds to 167.25 pc at a distance of 34.5 mpc ) from the central knot k3 .",
    "similar cometary blue compact dwarf galaxies mkn 59 and mkn 71 were studied extensively by @xcite .",
    "mkn 104 has three spatially resolved knots marked k6 , k7 and k8 in figure 2 .",
    "knot k6 is near the centre of this galaxy ; knots k7 and k8 are at a distance of 1.04 kpc and 2.6 kpc ( at a distance of 30.62 mpc , @xmath23 corresponds to 148.5 pc ) , respectively from the central knot k6 .",
    "the faint knot k8 at the northern edge of the galaxy is very well detected even in the @xmath9 band image ( figure 2(a ) ) .",
    "a total of eight star forming regions were identified manually in these two galaxies .",
    "the h@xmath6 flux for each of these regions were obtained within an aperture set for each knot as shown in the figures 1(b ) and 2(b ) .",
    "aperture selection was based on the criteria that each pixel has a minimum of 3@xmath24 counts above the background level , and it also has enough signal to give @xmath8@xmath9@xmath10@xmath11@xmath12 magnitudes which are accurate to at least 0.1 mag .",
    "absolute flux calibration was done using the standard stars from @xcite .",
    "equivalent width is calculated using the expression given by @xcite and is presented in table [ t2 ] .",
    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) calculated from h@xmath6 luminosity @xcite is as high as 0.04 @xmath1yr@xmath2 for knot k1 of i zw 97 and 0.02 @xmath1yr@xmath2 for knot k7 of mkn 104 .",
    "broad band @xmath8@xmath9@xmath10@xmath11@xmath12 images clearly show the cometary extensions for i zw 97 and three spatially resolved star forming regions of mkn 104 ( figures 1(a ) and 2(a ) ) .",
    "apertures drawn in the h@xmath6 images centered around the star forming regions were used to obtain the broad band magnitudes and colours . for sky subtraction , sky and galaxy background",
    "were estimated in an annulus just beyond the apertures set for the star forming regions .",
    "broad band magnitudes of the star forming regions were calibrated using standard stars from the list of @xcite .",
    "photometric errors calculated for the @xmath8@xmath9@xmath10@xmath11@xmath12 magnitudes lie in the range 0.05 - 0.09 mag .",
    "table [ t3 ] gives the magnitudes and colours of eight star forming regions of these galaxies .",
    "the surface brightness ( sb ) distribution of the underlying galaxy was obtained by fitting ellipses to the isophotes of the galaxies .",
    "this was done using the task _ ellipse _ available within _",
    "stsdas_. the bright h ii regions in the galaxies were masked in an iterative way . to begin with , an initial guess of the center of the ellipse , ellipticity , position angle were provided .",
    "the prominent h ii regions ( except the central one ) were masked manually by visual inspection and the ellipse fitting was carried out .",
    "the parameters of the best fit ellipse were used to generate an approximate h ii region free model of the galaxy with the help of _ bmodel _ task .",
    "a residual image was obtained by subtracting the h ii region free model image from the original galaxy . this residual image which consists of only bright h ii regions ,",
    "was run through _ imreplace _ task to replace all the other pixels with 0 except for the h ii regions .",
    "this h ii region image with zero background was subtracted from the original galaxy to get the underlying galaxy component .",
    "this process was iterated until a smooth h ii region free image of the underlying galaxy was obtained .",
    "the original @xmath9 band image and the h ii region free model image are shown at top left and top right frames of figure 4 , respectively .",
    "this final h ii region removed galaxy image was fed into galfit fitting algorithm of @xcite . in figure 4",
    ", galfit s model fit image is shown in the bottom left panel , and the residual image ( original image minus galfit s model fit image ) is shown in the bottom right panel .",
    "the ellipse fitting task was run on the best fit image of galfit .",
    "both the galaxies i zw 97 and mkn 104 were best fit with a double srsic profile whose parameters are shown in table [ t4 ] .",
    "further details are given in section [ sbpcp ] .",
    "medium resolution spectra of bright star forming regions of knots k1+k2 of i zw 97 and knots k6 and k7 of mkn 104 are displayed in figure 3 .",
    "the two star forming regions k1 and k2 of i zw 97 , could not be spatially resolved and hence their composite spectrum was extracted and is labeled k1+k2 .",
    "all three spectra show strong emission lines of hydrogen balmer series and of other elements like oxygen , nitrogen , sulphur and argon .",
    "all the balmer lines are corrected for underlying stellar absorption .",
    "correction for the underlying stellar absorption was made assuming an absorption equivalent width of 2   @xcite following @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this correction is essential , as the internal reddening estimate and the abundance calculation strongly depend on the fluxes of these balmer lines ( especially h@xmath25 flux ) .",
    "the internal reddening ( reddening within the galaxy ) can be estimated using the h@xmath6/h@xmath25 flux ratio as suggested by @xcite , provided the h@xmath6/h@xmath25 flux ratio is greater than the theoretical flux ratio of 2.87 .",
    "the h@xmath6/h@xmath25 flux ratio for all the three regions yielded a value less than the theoretical ratio of 2.87 and hence our spectra are not corrected for internal reddening , but corrected for foreground galactic extinction given by @xcite , as provided by ned .",
    "oxygen abundances for all the three regions were calculated using the standard bright line methods as suggested in the combined method of @xcite .",
    "flux ratios of various lines and the oxygen abundance estimated using these line ratios are listed in table [ t5 ] .",
    "mean log(o / h)+12 is 8.5 ( @xmath26/2.7 for solar oxygen abundance of 8.93 ) for the three regions .",
    "this value is subsolar , but not low enough to consider the current starburst as the first episode of star formation in these galaxies .",
    "the presence of an older population is evident from the presence of balmer absorption lines superposed over the strong emission lines in the central knot spectrum ( k6 ) of mkn 104 .",
    "this indicates that mkn 104 might be hosting a substantial older stellar population underlying the current starburst .",
    "the [ o iii]/h@xmath27 is obtained for all the three star forming regions implying harder ionizing radiation , a common feature found in other bcds also @xcite .",
    "the h ii region subtracted , smooth underlying galaxy image obtained through the iterative process ( described in section [ sbcp ] ) , was fed into the galfit algorithm of @xcite .",
    "the surface brightness profiles of the two galaxies , i zw 97 and mkn 104 can be fit well using the srsic profile .",
    "the srsic profile is defined as :    @xmath28(r ) = @xmath29 @xmath30}$ ]    where @xmath31 is the effective radius of the galaxy , @xmath29 is the surface brightness at @xmath31 , @xmath32 is power - law index and @xmath33 .",
    "a srsic profile transforms into a gaussian when @xmath32 = 0.5 , an exponential profile when @xmath32 = 1 and a de vaucouleurs profile when @xmath32 = 4 . here",
    ", the general form of the srsic profile was used to fit the surface brightness distribution of both the galaxies and it was found that two components are required for the fit .",
    "the galfit fitting process was started with two srsic profiles with power - law index @xmath32 = 0.5 and @xmath32 = 1 as an initial guess .",
    "the @xmath32 = 1 profile would represent the overall galaxy distribution if it is exponential and the @xmath32 = 0.5 profile would be able to fit the nuclear starburst found in both these galaxies .",
    "the best fit parameters obtained using galfit for both the galaxies are shown in table [ t4 ] .",
    "the surface brightness and colour profiles are plotted in figure 5 for both the galaxies . in the plots , points correspond to surface brightness and colours of the galaxies with h ii regions and thin lines correspond to the surface brightness and colours for the h ii region subtracted smooth galaxy obtained using galfit .",
    "the surface brightness distribution of i zw 97 can be modeled with an exponential profile except for a large bump at @xmath34 from the nucleus due to an intense starburst ( figure 5 ) .",
    "this large bump is not seen in the modeled profile of the h ii region masked galaxy obtained using galfit .",
    "the @xmath9 band surface brightness profile can be represented by a two component srsic profile with the first component having power - law index @xmath35 ( see table [ t4 ] ) , a scale length of @xmath36 kpc and surface brightness at @xmath31 of 20.78 mag.arcsec@xmath37 while the other component has power - law index @xmath38 , a scale length of @xmath39 kpc and surface brightness at @xmath31 of 22.64 mag.arcsec@xmath37 .",
    "the centre of the first component is slightly offset from the centre of the second component by @xmath40 ( @xmath41 pc ) .",
    "this represents a starburst with a gaussian distribution slightly offset from the central region of the galaxy .",
    "@xmath12 band surface brightness and colour profiles are affected by fringing due to which sky estimation becomes difficult and the outer isophotes are poorly detected .",
    "the @xmath9 band surface brightness profile of mkn 104 can also be represented by two component srsic profile , one having a srsic index of @xmath42 and another with srsic index @xmath43 ( the power - law index @xmath32 averaged over @xmath9@xmath10@xmath11@xmath12 bands is equal to @xmath44 for the one component and @xmath45 for the other component ) .",
    "the surface brightness at @xmath46 kpc is 20.20 mag.arcsec@xmath37 and at @xmath47 kpc is 21.42 mag.arcsec@xmath37 ( table [ t4 ] ) for the @xmath45 and @xmath44 components in @xmath9 band , respectively .",
    "both the components of mkn 104 have srsic index values higher than exponential and gaussian values .",
    "this implies that light profile falls off slightly faster in mkn 104 as compared to that in i zw 97 .",
    "the galfit results can be understood as large central at the centre of the galaxy , underlying which is a fainter continuum from a slightly older stellar population spread out over the face of the galaxy .",
    "a bump seen at radii of @xmath48 corresponds to the h ii region marked as knot k7 in figure 2 and which is masked completely using the iterative method .",
    "the major axis diameter at 25.0 mag.arcsec@xmath37 in @xmath9 band is found to be equal to 38 arcsec , a value similar to the one reported in 2004 sdss data release 2 ( from ned ) . here",
    "again the errors in the @xmath12 band profiles are confounded due to the fringing .",
    "figure 5 also shows colour profiles obtained by subtracting two surface brightness profiles .",
    "the colours , on average , remain constant until a semi - major axis length of about @xmath49 . except for @xmath50 colour",
    ", @xmath51 , @xmath4 and @xmath52 colours tend to become redder by 0.05 - 0.09 mag in the outer regions of both the galaxies .",
    "photometric errors may be considerably large at outer isophotes and the observed variations may not be real .",
    "colour profiles can be used as stellar age estimates when combined with a model such as starburst99 .",
    "figure 6 shows a two colour diagram wherein each colour is calculated by subtracting two surface brightness profiles as obtained in figure 5 .",
    "also plotted in these diagrams are starburst99 @xcite colour - colour plots ( thick lines in figure 6 ) for metallicity ( @xmath53 ) 0.008 and mass range 0.1 @xmath1 - 100 @xmath1 undergoing an instantaneous burst of star formation and evolving from 0.01 myr to 5 gyr . if , in the plots , various colours ( @xmath51 , @xmath50 , @xmath4 and @xmath52 ) represent the first and second dimension of the data , the third dimension for the plotted data points would be the radius or semi major axis length , while the third dimension for the thick line of starburst99 would be the age .",
    "the concentration of points at a particular location in these diagrams are the central region points where the sampling of the isophotes is better than in the outer regions .",
    "a central concentration of points in @xmath51 vs @xmath50 plot is seen to coincide with an age of @xmath54 myr for i zw 97 and @xmath55 myr for mkn 104 , which provides an estimate of the age of the underlying stellar population .",
    "the colours obtained from the surface brightness profiles are azimuthally averaged over an entire isophote and these colours may represent the galaxy background away from the current star forming regions .      to understand the star formation history of the two bcds",
    ", we have used the colour - colour evolutionary population synthesis model of starburst99 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the predicted colours evolving from 0.01 myr to 5 gyr were obtained using a proper choice of imf and also the metallicity .",
    "we chose a salpeter imf with the lower and upper mass limits of 0.1 @xmath1 and 100 @xmath1 .",
    "the metallicity ( @xmath53 ) of the galaxy is found to be 0.008 as measured from spectroscopy ( section [ lss ] ) .",
    "the padova 1994 stellar evolutionary models with agb tracks were used to obtain the starburst colour tracks and seds in starburst99 ( dust - free model ) .",
    "the importance of the development of agb stars at later ages ( 100 myr - 1 gyr ) has been extensively reviewed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that the @xmath3 and @xmath51 colours are not much affected by the onset of the agb for near - solar metallicity but the visual colours of the low - metallicity models are strongly affected by the development of the agb as well as by all the uncertainties in the agb evolution @xcite .",
    "the evolutionary tracks in startburst99 created using these inputs are in very good agreement with that of the @xcite galaxev models .",
    "one such evolutionary track is plotted in figure 7 for @xmath3 vs @xmath4 colours .",
    "@xmath11 band is not considered here because of uncertainties due to the h@xmath6 emission present within @xmath11 band . the solid line track shown in figure 7 runs from 0.01 myr to 5 gyr .",
    "also plotted in the figure is the reddening vector for a@xmath56 = 1 mag extinction .",
    "it is observed that the star forming knots of both the galaxies do not lie on the track exactly .",
    "the reddening vector clearly shows that the colours are reddened by 1 magnitude .",
    "the reason for this disagreement could be the uncertainties in the estimation of the galaxy background underlying these individual star forming regions which may lead to inaccurate flux estimates and hence colours .",
    "the second reason could be improper determination of the reddening values , and the third reason could be that there are multiple populations embedded in these regions .",
    "it has been well established now that bcds are not very young systems undergoing their first episode of star formation ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , but rather possess an older , underlying population of stars .",
    "the reddening of 1 mag gives us a hint about the presence of an underlying old stellar population , although a small contribution due to dust within the star forming regions can not be ruled out .",
    "this idea of underlying old stellar population may be incorporated in the mixed population colour - colour diagram to reveal further information about the star forming regions of these bcds .",
    "the episodic star formation scenario was explored using the mixed population colour - colour model curve shown in figure 7 :    consider a mixture of population ages ranging from 2 myr to 9 myr and a population ranging 200 myr to 900 myr with an underlying older stellar population of few gyrs ; then the combined colours of these three populations form a locus of points which are shown as smaller curves in figure 7 .",
    "shorter curves in figure 7 represent the locus of points ranging from 2 myr + 200 myr to 9 myr + 900 myr population mixed with a 4 gyr old population .",
    "the fraction of young to older population can also be changed which gives 3 smaller curves displaced by small amounts .",
    "a burst strength parameter , @xmath57 , is defined as the fraction of young population to old population by mass .",
    "the parameter @xmath58 represents the fraction of young stars of age 2 myr-9 myr to older stars of age 4 gyr .",
    "similarly , parameter @xmath59 is the fraction of 200 myr-900 myr old stars to 4 gyr population .",
    "the shorter curves in figure 7 represent loci of points corresponding to a mixed population of 2 myr+200 myr going to a 9 myr+900 myr with fraction @xmath58 as 0.007 ( dark blue curve ) , 0.01 ( dark green curve ) and 0.015 ( magenta curve ) , keeping @xmath59 constant at 0.05 (",
    "i.e. , 5% by mass ) , or in other words , the contribution of current burst is taken as 0.7% , 1% and 1.5% by mass with respect to 4 gyr old population .",
    "knots k1 , k2 , k4 and k5 reside in these curves providing clues about their underlying stellar populations .",
    "a short dark red curve sits at a slightly redder @xmath3 colour .",
    "knot k3 , located at the centre of i zw 97 , is situated in this short dark red curve .",
    "this curve represents the locus of points having age range from 2 myr+200 myr to 9 myr+900 myr mixed with a 4 gyr population , but the fraction of young to old , i.e @xmath58 = 0.005 and fraction of 200 myr to old , i.e @xmath59 is 0.7 .",
    "this implies that only 0.5% by mass is in the current burst and a significant contribution ( @xmath60% ) is from a @xmath5 myr population .",
    "it can be clearly seen that all the knots of i zw 97 are located on these curves .",
    "this substantiates the fact that this bcd has underlying older populations of age 4 gyr + @xmath5 myr , and superposed on this is a much younger episode of star formation only 4.5 - 6 myr .",
    "knot k3 in the figure corresponds to the nucleus of i zw 97 and is found to have a slightly older age @xmath61 myr for the current burst and knot k1 seen at the south - western end of the galaxy ( figure 1 ) shows a young 4.7 myr population .",
    "such strong extranuclear starburst regions are a signature of propagating star - forming activity along the main stellar body of these cometary bcds , as also observed by @xcite .",
    "the ages of the knots can be derived with better accuracy using the h@xmath6 equivalent width versus age plot from a starburst99 model for 0.008 ( @xmath53 ) metallicity .",
    "figure 8 shows a plot of h@xmath6 equivalent width versus age ; it can be seen that the knots lie in the age range 6 myr to 13 myr ( closed circles ) . however , the continuum around h@xmath6 emission is contaminated by the old stellar population embedded in these regions .",
    "equivalent widths were corrected for underlying stellar populations of ages 500 myr and 4 gyr , as estimated above , resulting in younger ages for the knots ( figure 8 ; open circles ) .",
    "the ages of knots k1-k5 are in the range 5 - 6 myr .",
    "the ages of star forming regions are presented in table [ t2 ] .",
    "the estimated ages are similar to the ones obtained from the colour - colour mixed population model ( figure 7 ) .",
    "an underlying old stellar population aged 4 gyr + 500 myr is found in this galaxy , but the spectrum of the star forming knot k1+k2 shows no signatures of the underlying old component .",
    "absorption lines like mg i b absorption , na d1 and d2 lines , cn band , characteristic of the gyr old population are completely absent in the spectrum and , if present , have equivalent widths @xmath62  .",
    "the reason for this could be the recent intense starburst at the locations of knot k1+k2 . for a sample of bcds , using an empirical population synthesis method with different continuum fluxes and absorption equivalent widths of the above mentioned lines , @xcite obtained the percentage contribution of newly born stars ( or h ii regions with @xmath63 yr ) , young stars ( @xmath64 yr ) , intermediate age stars ( @xmath65 yr ) and old star ( @xmath66 yr ) . according to this estimation , for i zw 97 @xcite arrived at a conclusion that 60% of the total light is due to stars of ages in the range @xmath67 yr , implying population of young stars to be high .",
    "intermediate age stars ( 1 gyr- 9 gyr ) accounts for up to 20% , and the remaining 20% of the population involves newly born stars and very old stars within the galaxy .",

    "the sfr calculated using the h@xmath6 luminosity is as high as 0.04 @xmath1yr@xmath2 and 0.02 @xmath1yr@xmath2 for the brightest star forming regions of i zw 97 and mkn 104 respectively .",
    "both galaxies show indication of a significant population of age 300 - 500 myr , which is enhanced in mkn 104 possibly due to a group environment .",
    "i zw 97 shows a higher rate of star formation at the current epoch , and indication of supernovae - induced star formation ( i zw 97 hosts the type ii supernova sn 2008bx , located close to knot k5 , as discovered very recently by @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible that we are witnessing i zw 97 at an earlier epoch of episodic star formation whereas mkn 104 is in a later epoch .",
