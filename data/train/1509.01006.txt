    "it is well - known that in oscillating flows the motion of a material ( fluid ) particle consists of two parts : oscillating and non - oscillating .",
    "the latter is known as a _ drift _ , see @xcite , and many others .",
    "the great significance of a drift due to its key role in the vortex dynamics of oscillating flows and langmuir circulations was recently analyzed from a new perspective by @xcite .",
    "here we study the advection of a lagrangian scalar field by a given oscillating velocity .",
    "we employ the two - timing approach combined with eulerian time - averaging operation in the form introduced by @xcite .",
    "the two - timing method has been used by many authors , see @xcite , however our analysis goes well beyond the usual calculations of main approximations in various special cases .",
    "our analytic calculations are straightforward by their nature , but they do include a large number of integration by parts and algebraic transformations ; the performing of such calculations in a general formulation represents a ` champion - type ' result by itself .",
    "these calculations are too bulky to be presented in jfm , they are described in detail in the arxiv papers by @xcite quoted below as i and ii , therefore here we present only some results of these calculations . _",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to introduce a new systematic and general viewpoint on the hierarchy of distinguished limits and drifts_. this new viewpoint helps to organize and unify a number of results , including that of i and ii .",

    "the hyperbolic equation ( [ exact-1 ] ) has characteristics curves ( trajectories ) @xmath7 described by an ode @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are eulerian and lagrangian coordinates .",
