    "over the last few years a large amount of new high - precision experimental data related to primary electrons and positrons in cosmic rays was obtained in the experiments of a new generation : ppb - bets @xcite , atic @xcite , pamela @xcite , fermi / lat @xcite , h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite , magic @xcite .",
    "some observed features of the data were unexpected and , now compared to the beginning of the 2000 s , the situation looks very exciting and intriguing .",
    "the difference can be seen clearly if one compares the content of the present review with d. mller paper @xcite with an almost similar title but published in 2001 .",
    "the main subject of present review is the total energy spectrum of cosmic ray electrons and positrons in the energy range higher than approximately 100  gev , the positron fraction in the total flux , and related astrophysics . a number of interesting problems like charge - dependent solar modulation ; anisotropy of electron and positron fluxes ; and some others are not considered .",
    "hereinafter , in this paper , the term `` electrons '' is used for the sum of all cosmic ray charged leptons regardless of the charge .",
    "otherwise , `` negative electrons '' or `` positrons '' are used .    in the total cosmic rays flux ,",
    "the fraction of electrons is small ( see figure  [ fig : ratioelectoprot ] ) .",
    "however , due to their special properties , they are very important to the astrophysics . for high - energy electrons ( @xmath1  gev ) , the dominant channel of energy losses is synchrotron radiation due to interaction of electrons with interstellar magnetic fields and inverse compton scattering . in the thompson approximation , that holds for electrons very well up to energies around a few tev , the rate of the energy loss is given by : @xmath2 where the factor @xmath3 is @xmath4 in ( [ eq : bo ] ) @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 are the energy density of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , infrared , and starlight photons respectively , @xmath8 is the mean - square induction of the magnetic field , and @xmath9 is the thompson cross section . due to the small mass of electrons compared to the proton mass , the radiative energy losses of electrons are much stronger than the radiative losses of protons and nuclei .",
    "the value of @xmath3 for electrons is not known exactly but it is believed widely that @xmath10 .     to the thin disk approximation  the geometry of the galactic disk and diffusion halo . ]     to the thin disk approximation  the geometry of the galactic disk and diffusion halo .",

    "tev the formula ( [ eq : tmax ] ) produces the value @xmath18  years which is much shorter than the lifetime of protons in the galaxy ( @xmath19  years ) . in the diffusion approximation the mean distance which could be passed by high - energy electrons during their lifetime",
    "is determined approximately by the diffusion length @xmath20 for the diffusion coefficient @xmath21 , the widely adopted expression is : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "then for @xmath25 and with formula ( [ eq : de ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : rmax ] ) may be written as @xmath26 for @xmath27 , one obtains from ( [ eq : rmax2 ] ) : @xmath28  kpc , @xmath29  kpc .",
    "it can be seen that the flux of the @xmath30tev - energy electrons are sensitive to nearby sources in the range of the order of only one kiloparsec and this is very different from the nuclei component of cosmic rays .",
    "it was recognized clearly more than forty years ago @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of electron flux to a few nearby sources like pulsars or supernova remnants ( snr ) makes it very important for astrophysics .",
    "the other reason of the importance of cosmic ray electrons for astrophysics is a possible connection of them with dark mater ( dm ) annihilation or decay and with other exotic sources like black hole evaporation etc .",
    "there are numerous more or less conservative or , on the contrary , very exotic scenarios and models to describe and understand the data related to the cosmic ray electrons .",
    "it is convenient to start with the most conservative one  the so called ` conventional model ' .",
    "since s.i . syrovatskii seminal paper @xcite , the diffusion approximation is considered to be a reasonable approximation in the transportation problem of cosmic ray electrons . in the simplest case of homogenious and isotropic diffusion ,",
    "the diffusion equation reads : @xmath31 + d(e)\\nabla^2\\rho + q(\\mathbf{r } , e , t ) .",

    "hereinafter in this paper we measure @xmath33 in gev and do not write explicitly @xmath42 in formulae .      in this review",
    "we use various simplified analytical solutions of the transport equation ( [ eq : diffusioneq ] ) systematically to understand and illustrate the physics of cosmic ray electrons .",
    "whilst such models are not exact , they can be very useful and instructive .",
    "one such model is the model of infinitely thin and homogeneous galactic disk together with an infinitely thick galactic halo .",
    "the half - depth of the diffusion galatic halo is @xmath43  kpc which , for 100  gev1  tev electrons , is larger than the expected diffusion electron range @xmath44  kpc . at the same time , the half - depth of the galaxy disk , at the position of the sun , is only about 150  pc which is much smaller than @xmath45 ( see figure  [ fig : galaxy ] ) .",
    "therefore in first approximation , for the sources of electrons located within the galatic disk , the depth of the halo may be considered as infinitely large . at the same time , the source of electrons located within the galatic disk , may be considered to be infinitely thin relative to the value of @xmath45 . moreover",
    ", the sun is located very close to the galatic plane , therefore , in this model , the flux of electrons , calculated exactly for @xmath46 , is a reasonable approximation in understanding the electron spectrum in the energy range 100  gev1  tev .",
    "now , we consider a source of electrons with spectrum @xmath47 , constant in the time , and distributed homogeneously at @xmath46 in the infinitely thin plane .",
    "then , the source function reads : @xmath48 and the solution ( [ eq : diffusiongensol ] ) of the transport equation ( [ eq : diffusioneq ] ) for @xmath46 reduces to : @xmath49{0.4pt}{5mm}_{\\,z=0 } = \\frac{1}{b_0\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\frac{1}{e^2}\\int_e^\\infty\\frac{q(e')}{\\lambda(e , e')}de ' .",
    "\\label{eq : qthingensol}\\ ] ] for power - law spectrum @xmath50 and with diffusion coefficient , defined by ( [ eq : de ] ) , the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qthingensol ] ) is calculated easily and , for the observed spectrum , one obtains : @xmath49{0.4pt}{5mm}_{\\,z=0 } = q_0 e^{-(\\gamma + \\delta)};\\quad    \\delta = \\delta + \\frac{1}{2 } ,    \\label{eq : qthinpowerlawsol}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is some constant ( could be calculated explicitly ) .",
    "therefore , instead of the source spectrum with the index @xmath52 , an observer measures the electron spectrum steeper on @xmath53 . since @xmath54 , then @xmath55 . in other words , @xmath56 .",
    "it is a rather robust result .",
    "it does not depend on the model fine details .",
    "for example , for a model of infinite homogeneous source , instead of a thin plane source , one checks easily that the solution for power - law spectrum would be @xmath57 .",
    "it is rather close to ( [ eq : qthinpowerlawsol ] ) since @xmath56 .",
    "please note that , throughout the paper , we neglect the effects of solar modulation since these may be important only for the energies below @xmath58  gev , however we are interested mainly in energies above 10100  gev .      cosmic ray electron spectrum , which was calculated in i.v .",
    "moskalenko and a.w .",
    "strong paper @xcite , are referred commonly to as `` conventional model '' .",
    "a family of similar models were studied also earlier by r. j. protheroe in @xcite .",
    "the conventional model is the most conservative approach in understanding the cosmic negative electron and positron fluxes .",
    "in the model , it is supposed that there exist two main sources of negative electrons and positrons .",
    "generally , the first kind of sources is the same for primary negative electrons and nuclei ( like supernova remnants , snr ) .",
    "however , sources of this kind do not accelerate positrons . in the conventional model , this kind of sources",
    "is considered in continuous and homogeneous approximation .",
    "the primary negative electrons source spectral index and the intensity of the source were tuned in @xcite to fit the experimental data .",
    "the second kind of source is secondary electrons produced in inelastic scattering of cosmic ray protons and other nuclei in interstellar medium ( ism ) gas .",
    "moreover , it is supposed in the conventional model that this kind of the source is the only source for positrons .",
    "the spectra were calculated in @xcite by numerical solution of diffusion transport equation for a realistic distribution of the substance in the galaxy .",
    "this was done by using the well - known galprop system @xcite developed by the authors of paper @xcite .",
    "however it is meaningful to study the conventional model by a more simple analytical solution of the transport equation such as homogeneous thin disk approximation , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : qthingensol ] ,  [ eq : qthinpowerlawsol ] ) since such models show very clearly the underlying physics and main features of the result .",
    "we suppose power - law source function with spectral index @xmath59 for primary negative electrons and no positrons at all for snr as a source . the spectral index @xmath59 is not known exactly but it is commonly believed @xmath60 and it is expected @xmath59 to be close to the spectral index of proton source spectrum since the sources of the primary electrons and cosmic ray protons are generally the same @xcite .",
    "the index @xmath59 should be considered as a matter of fit of a model to the data .",
    "the main source of the secondary electrons is cosmic ray protons that produce them via @xmath61 decay after interaction with ism nuclei .",
    "the spectrum of secondary electrons is a power - law spectrum with the spectral index equal to the spectral index of the observed spectrum of cosmic ray protons , @xmath62 .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ eq : qthinpowerlawsol ] ) implies the total spectrum of negative electrons together with positrons to be :    @xmath63    where @xmath64 are amplitudes of the primary negative electron flux , secondary negative electron flux , and secondary positron flux respectively .",
    "the fit of the conventional model to the data in the paper @xcite shows that the flux of the primary electrons is much higher than the flux of the secondary ones .",
    "therefore the first term in the sum ( [ eq : thingalaxytotal ] ) dominates strongly and , actually , the shape of the spectrum @xmath65 is close to the power law with the spectral index @xmath66 . for the fraction of positrons in the total electron flux one obtains easily : @xmath67 the value",
    "@xmath68 is essentially positive in its nature since it is supposed that primary electrons and protons have similar source spectrum indexes and @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , the ratio @xmath70 is a decreasing function of energy .",
    "thus , an approximate power - law spectrum with the spectral index @xmath71 for the total electron flux , and a decreasing fraction of positrons are generic predictions of the conventional model .",
    "these features do not depend on details of the conventional model realization .",
    "the conventional model is used commonly as a reference point for discussion of electron data . also , from the point of view of the conventional model being the first step of the analysis , we present and discuss the data from the experiments .",
    "in the total electron spectrum , the most interesting features , measured in recent experiments , were observed above 100  gev .",
    "consequently , we restricted ourselves to reviewing only the data of experiments containing energy points above 100  gev .",
    "electron spectra , measured in several well - known but relatively low - energy experiments such as ams-01 @xcite and heat @xcite were excluded from the review .",
    "we divided into two classes all the available data on the high - energy cosmic - ray electron spectrum .",
    "we called the first class of data ` low - resolution experiments ' . this class",
    "related to the spectral data measured with relatively large energy binning for the electron energy : more than approximately 12%15% per bin .",
    "even if a spectrometer could provide a higher energy resolution , too large energy binning prevented the observation of details in the spectrum which were finer than the width of the energy bin .",
    "the second class of data addressed measurements with much more narrow energy binning in the electron spectrum together with the high energy resolution of the apparatus .",
    "in such ` high - resolution experiments ' , simultaneously , the energy binning and the resolution were better than 5%8% .",
    "all available data except the only atic experiment @xcite at the time of the preparation of this review , were of the first ( low - resolution ) class , and the high - resolution class of measurements was represented by the only atic measurements @xcite . in this section , we review the data from the low - resolution experiments .",

    "atic covered the energy range from 30  gev to more than 2  tev and provided the data with much better statistics than from all previous experiments .",

    "consequently , the existence of this bump - like feature in the electron spectrum proved rather more conclusive this time ( 2008 ) .",

    "fermi / lat provided very high statistics and confirmed atic data in the energy range 30200  gev by showing the spectral index to be close to 3.0 .",
    "however , at higher energies , the fermi / lat spectrum did not exhibit any prominent spectral features similar to the atic bump .",
    "the fermi / lat instrument had a lower energy resolution than the atic spectrometer due to the thin calorimeter of fermi / lat against the atic thick for electrons calorimeter .",
    "however , this reason could not explain the lack of the structures in the fermi / lat data . also , in 2009 , a complete analysis ( low - energy analysis together with high - energy analysis ) of the electron spectrum , measured by a ground - based erenkov telescope h.e.s.s . in the energy range 350  gev5  tev , was published in the paper @xcite ( the high - energy part of the spectrum was published previously in 2008 @xcite ) . the h.e.s.s .",

    "it is important that the fermi / lat experiment is a very high - statistical one ; however , the statistical significance of the data from ppb - bets and atic experiments also was rather good .",

    "we can say , with confidence , that now , the main problem is not the lack of statistics but unaccounted systematic errors in the experiments .",

    "it was @xmath175 ( @xmath176 is a radiative unit ) in atic-2 and @xmath177 in atic-4 .",
    "as a result , the energy resolution for electrons of the instrument was high in the total energy range of 30  gev1  tev .",
    "the simulation predicted and the beam tests confirmed that the resolution , in terms of half width on the half height , was not worse than 3% @xcite ( see figure  [ fig : atic - resolution ] ) .",
    "such high resolution , together with relatively high statistics , allows a meaningful measurement of the electron spectrum in the high - resolution mode  with energy bins as small as 58% ( 0.0200.035 of decimal logarithm of energy ) .",
    "such high - resolution measurements were carried out for atic-2 and atic-4 flights in @xcite and revealed a fine structure in the region of `` atic bump''(200600  gev ) which was reproduced in both flights , see figure  [ fig : a2-a4-fine ] .",
    "it can be seen that there were three peaks near 250  gev , 350  gev and 450  gev respectively and three dips near 220  gev , 300  gev and 420  gev .",
    "figure  [ fig : a2-a4-fine ] shows the spectra of electrons without subtraction of the residual proton background and without an atmospheric correction . both the proton background and the factor of atmospheric correction",
    "are smooth functions and can not disturb the fine structure notably . only these ` raw ' spectra are the input for the estimation of the statistical significance of the fine structure .",
    "the statistical significance was estimated in @xcite by two different ways .",
    "the first way was to use the usual @xmath178-test for the total atic-2+atic-4 spectrum .",
    "the second one was to use the degree of correlation between the structures measured separately by atic-2 and atic-4 . in both ways the statistical significance of the fine structure was estimated as 99.7% .",
    "please note that the bin statistics are not really low in the spectrum  it varies from 70 events / bin to 40 events / bin near the three mentioned above peaks of the fine structure for the total spectrum atic-2+atic-4 , see figure  [ fig : n - a2a4-fine ] .",
    "the observed fine structure is expected to be stable against all known possible systematic errors since they can not produce any short - scale structures in the spectrum .",
    "moreover , the observed fine structure passed and survived a number of tests on stability against possible systematics @xcite .",

    "although the statistical significance of the observed phenomenon is not low and it looks systematically firm , it should be confirmed by independent experiments to be considered absolutely seriously of course .",
    "however , if the structure is confirmed , it is very important in understanding the nature of the electron spectrum anomalies and the nature of dm . as we explained in section  [ subhalos ] above",
    ", the annihilation of dm particles could not produce several narrow peaks in the electron spectrum .",
    "therefore , dm annihilation could not be an origin of the observed fine structure .",
    "moreover , since the amplitude of the fine structure is very high , most of the intensity of the observed electron spectrum , at energies above 200  gev , could not be attributed to dm annihilation or decay , therefore a high boost factor for dm annihilation is excluded .",
    "the most natural explanation of the fine structure is a contribution of several nearby pulsars to the cosmic ray electron flux .",
    "in fact , a fine structure of the electron spectrum which was very similar to the observed in the atic experiment , was predicted on the basis of nearby pulsars model in the article @xcite independently on the actual observation .",
    "the predicted fine structure is seen clearly in figure  [ fig : malyshev - pulsars ] .",
    "moreover , it was argued in @xcite that such features in the electron spectrum at high energies , would suggest strongly a pulsar origin of the anomalous contribution to the electron flux against its dark matter origin .",
    "let us note that the authors of the atic paper @xcite observed the fine structure also independently of the paper @xcite .",
    "the first message about the fine structure was published in @xcite and the first preliminary spectra were shown in the paper @xcite without references to @xcite .     a series of a single - pulsar electron spectra for different @xmath179 with other parameters @xmath180pc , @xmath92 , @xmath181tev , @xmath182erg , @xmath95@xmath96 , @xmath97@xmath98 . ]     a series of a single - pulsar electron spectra for different @xmath179 with other parameters @xmath180pc , @xmath92 , @xmath181tev , @xmath182erg , @xmath95@xmath96 , @xmath97@xmath98 .",

    "it can be seen from figures [ fig : a2-a4-fine ] and [ fig : n - a2a4-fine ] that the observed fine structure of the electron spectrum shows an even higher amplitude than the structure predicted in @xcite ( see figure  [ fig : malyshev - pulsars ] ) .",
    "this poses a question : is it actually possible for nearby pulsars to produce a structure with so high an amplitude ?",
    "this question was discussed , for the first time , in the paper @xcite .",
    "there , it was argued that it was possible , in principle ; however , an unusual supposition had to be done about the cutoff of the conventional electron background near 200  gev .",

    "+    in order to obtain a structure of the electron spectrum , like that observed in the atic experiment , obviously , the single - pulsar peaks , in the energy range 200700  gev , must be very sharp and narrow .",
    "what may a single - pulsar spectrum look like ?",
    "five series of single - pulsar electron spectra , for various parameters of pulsars and ism , were obtained with the expression for a single - pulsar spectrum ( [ eq : pulsarsolution ] ) .",
    "these are shown in figures [ fig : tr - t - r1000ecut01gamma1.3 ] , [ fig : tr - ecut ] , [ fig : tr - gamma ] , [ fig : tr - r ] , and [ fig : tr - delta ] .",
    "it can be seen from these figures , that sharp and sufficiently strong single - pulsar electron peaks can be obtained from a variety ways with quite natural parameters . by combining these ways ,",
    "the measured fine structure can be fitted , also , to many different ways .",
    "our task was not to identify each observed feature in the measured fine structure of the electron spectrum with some definite known pulsar .",
    "our opinion was that this problem was too difficult now for two reasons .",
    "firstly , the distances to the nearby pulsars were known poorly ( some other parameters , too , were known poorly ) . secondly , since the birth velocities of pulsars , due to asymmetric supernova explosions , were very high , the pulsars known locations had little in common with those locations where the pulsars had ejected the electrons . the mean birth velocity was @xmath183  km / sec and a velocity above @xmath184  km / sec was not rare @xcite . typically , the difference between a current pulsar location and a location of burst - like ejection of the electrons by this pulsar may be hundreds of parsecs , and it is exactly the scale of distances from nearby pulsars to the sun . therefore , the distances to actual bust - like sources are almost completely unknown and it is meaningless to try to fit the current positions of pulsars .",
    "consequently , we tried to demonstrate only that the fit of the fine structure by pulsars was possible with some reasonable suppositions .",
    "figure  [ fig : atic - fit - electrons ] shows an example of a fit of the electron spectrum generated by several pulsars with the conventional background .",
    "the conventional background is exactly the same as in figures [ fig : allelectronsbefore2000][fig : allelectronscurrentstate ] .",
    "the propagation parameters for this picture are @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath25 .",
    "the points in the figure denote the high - resolution electron spectrum measured by atic-2@xmath83atic-4 with the correct absolute normalization .",
    "the proton background is subtracted ; and the scattering of electrons in the residual atmosphere above the apparatus is corrected ( see @xcite for details ) . the energy bin size is 0.035 of the decimal logarithm ( 8.4% ) . below 200  gev ,",
    "the data are fitted by two distinct pulsars ; however , it should be considered only as an illustration .",
    "also , this region could be fitted by a continuum of far pulsars , as was done in paper @xcite .",
    "the generated electron peaks is very sharp within the simple analytical model ( [ eq : pulsarsolution ] ) . actually , the single - pulsar peaks are smeared out of course by the ism inhomogeneity .",
    "however , this smearing is expected to be about only 5% for @xmath187  tev electrons @xcite .",
    "such a small smearing could not change notably the obtained picture .",
    ".[tab : pulsparam ] parameters of pulsars used to generate figure  [ fig : atic - fit - electrons ] . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     there are many other reasonable sets of parameters which , equally well , could fit the data  this fit is a typical ill - defined problem . however , it is important that , in any successful fit of the data , the fraction of the pulsars electron flux in the total flux of electrons above 200  gev , must be very high to generate a structure with sufficiently high amplitude .",
    "it suggests immediately that the positron fraction must rise very rapidly along the energy and must reach values as high as @xmath188 near 400500  gev .",
    "it is illustrated in figure  [ fig : atic - fit - positrons ] that was generated by the same sets of parameters as figure  [ fig : atic - fit - electrons ] .",
    "it is a very important and generic prediction of the model ; we formulated it already in paper @xcite .",
    "this prediction was done before the positron fraction , measured by fermi / lat @xcite , was published , and , now , the model prediction was confirmed by the data up to the energies about 200  gev .",
    "anothr important prediction of the model is a fine structure that can be seen in the positron fraction curve at highest energies in figure  [ fig : atic - fit - positrons ] .",
    "it is not an artifact of the model .",
    "it is a generic implication of a variation of the pulsars flux in relation to the smooth conventional background in the energy range of the observed fine structure 200 - 600  gev . in principle , this fine structure may be measured , also .",
    "however , since the amplitude of the structure in the positron fraction is less that the fine structure amplitude in the electron spectrum , it is a more difficult problem than the observation of the fine structure in the total electron spectrum . also , there is a need for high - resolution measurements of the positron fraction to observe the phenomenon .",
    "as understood from this review , there was a great progress , over the last ten years , in measurements and understanding of electrons and positrons in cosmic rays .",
    "however , there is an extremely urgent need for new precise and high - statistical experiments .",
    "the information from recent measurements of the total electron spectrum is very contradictory .",
    "there are a group of experiments which show a bump - like structure in the region 200700  gev : ppb - bets @xcite , atic @xcite , ecc @xcite , may be , also , the preliminary data of magic @xcite .",
    "definitely , the fermi / lat spectrometer does not confirm the bump @xcite .",
    "the result of h.e.s.s .",
    "telescope is unclear in this respect , due to high energy threshold @xcite , and the pamela spectrum @xcite has too low statistics for definite conclusions in this region .",
    "also , the absolute flux differs for different modern experiments on a factor up to 3 in the region 300500  gev .",
    "the positron fraction was measured by pamela @xcite and fermi / lat @xcite up to 200  gev only . moreover , the data in the region 100200  gev are indirect since they were obtained with the help of the earth magnetic field , and not directly with a spectrometer .",
    "there is an urgent need for high precision measurements of positron fraction for energies up to 500  gev .    the fine structure of the electron spectrum , measured by high - resolution atic experiment @xcite ,",
    "could not be compared with any existing data since the atic spectrum was the only up to date high - resolution measurement of the electron spectrum .",
    "the fine structure , measured by atic above 200  gev , could not be resolved by using energy bins as wide as in the fermi / lat spectrum @xcite and in all other published data .",
    "moreover , the atic spectrum relates to the part of the southern sky with the declination between @xmath189 and @xmath190 , whilst the fermi / lat spectrum integrates the flux over the whole sky .",
    "taking into account the possible anisotropy of the electron energy spectrum , it would be more correct to compare the atic spectrum with the spectrum measured by some high - resolution and high - statistical experiment for the same part of the sky .",
    "the above noted lack of data is especially dramatic since a fine structure in the electron spectrum ( and , also , in the positron fraction ) may be a critical test in selecting dark matter or local sources like nearby pulsars as an origin of anomalies in the electron spectrum and positron fraction ( see section [ finestructure ] ) .",
    "usual experiments , with large energy binning in the spectrum , could not distinguish between dark matter and nearby pulsars as sources of cosmic ray electrons .",
    "therefore , there is a need not only for high - statistical and safe against systematic errors measurements but , also , for high - resolution measurements  measurements with narrow energy bins ( @xmath1918% or less ) .",
