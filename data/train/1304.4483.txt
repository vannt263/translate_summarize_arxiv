    "strongly correlated systems are of high interest in modern physics . strong correlations can emerge at very different physical regimes . in dusty plasmas , the high particle charges are responsible for the strong correlations , while ions in traps or laser plasmas can be strongly correlated due to the small particle distances  @xcite .    besides static properties , experiments and molecular dynamics simulations provide insight to dynamic properties . particle transport ( diffusion ) is well investigated  @xcite . also , the heat transport is is an important property that was experimentally investigated in extended systems  @xcite .",
