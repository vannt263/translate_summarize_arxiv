    "with the advent of highly charged @xmath0 , low energy ion sources , the interaction of slow multiply charged ions with surfaces has developed into one of the most active areas in the field of particle - solid interactions .",
    "on the most fundamental level , its interest is derived from the complex many - body response of metal electrons to the strong coulomb perturbation characterized by a large sommerfeld parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the neutralization is a true multi - electron capture ( and loss ) process involving up to the order of @xmath2 electrons and posing a considerable challenge to theory .",
    "furthermore , resonant transfer processes involve highly excited levels in the ions and are expected to set in at large distances from the surfaces when the rydberg wavefunction begins to `` touch '' the surface .",
    "the study of multiply and highly charged ion - surface interaction is also of considerable importance for the understanding of surface damage and plasma - wall interactions .    as experimental techniques",
    "have become more sophisticated , the motivation for these studies has broadened to elucidate the dynamical response of the many - body system of the surface to a very strong coulomb perturbation on one side and to material science , surface diagnostics , characterization and modification on the other . given the diversity of the subject and its rapid growth , no attempt of completeness of this overview will be made .",
    "we will briefly review the neutralization scenario now widely accepted and discuss new experimental and theoretical results which have expanded our understanding of highly charged ion ( hci ) surface interactions .",
    "the key element will be the `` classical over barrier '' ( cob ) model for electron transfer into rydberg states @xcite .",
    "this model has been remarkably successful in a qualitative and , sometimes , quantitative description of charge transfer between surfaces and hci .",
    "originally developed for metals , it has been extended to insulators . despite its success ,",
    "its conceptual foundation and range of validity is far from being well established .    only for simple , effective one - electron processes , fully quantum mechanical models for electronic processes",
    "have been developed , a few of which will be briefly discussed .",
    "first attempts to develop a many - body theory have been taken within the framework of time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) . both the potential as well as major limitations of such methods will be summarized .    driven by both conceptual interest and by technical applications ,",
    "nano - scale surfaces have taken center stage .",
    "interactions with internal walls of both metallic and insulating nano - capillaries will be considered .",
    "we will focus on material science applications of collisions with surfaces .",
    "here , the use of ion scattering as a tool to study surface magnetism and for active manipulation and modification of surfaces by charged particle impact are currently hot topics of investigation .",
    "the latter holds the promise of self - organized and , possibly functionally controlled , nanostructures .",
    "this paper is not meant as a comprehensive review but as an introduction into current developments and unsolved problems in the field of ion - surface scattering .",

    "interaction of slow highly charged ions ( hci ) with surfaces is a true many - body problem involving a complex array of processes on different time and energy scales , schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "they are driven by the large amount of potential energy ( pe ) given by the sum over all successive ionization potential @xmath3 of the hci , @xmath4 brought into the collision .",
    "pe can easily reach tens @xmath5 and , for slow ions , considerably exceed the kinetic energy @xmath6 of the projectile . for grazing incidence where the normal component @xmath7 is small compared to the parallel component , @xmath8",
    ", we have @xmath9 such that penetration of the projectile into deeper layers of the solid can be ruled out .",
    "the ensuing interaction scenario is dominated by competing mechanisms for dynamical screening , conversion and dissipation of the incident energy into electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom , particle emission and , ultimately structural deformations of the solid surface . in the first stage of this scenario ,",
    "the ion polarizes the surface and creates a ( self ) image potential , @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the bulk dielectric function of the target while @xmath13 represent the optical limit @xmath14 of the surface dielectric function @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "ideal conductors and thus metallic surfaces correspond to the limit @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",
    "the attractive image force leads to an acceleration , and thus to a bending of the trajectory towards the surface . at a critical distance @xmath18 the electronic response",
    "is no longer confined to a polarization within the surface but results in transfer of electrons into high lying states of the projectile .",
    "the formation of `` hollow atoms '' @xcite ( more precisely , hollow ions ) marks this second stage . as the projectile approaches the surface , part of the potential energy",
    "is released by electron emission in auger processes involving both electrons localized around the ion as well as near the surface .",
    "the relaxation during this stage is , however , too slow to render the projectile in its ground state . in vicinity to the surface , quasi - resonant capture from inner shells ( `` side feeding '' @xcite ) as well as two - center auger capture @xcite begin to fill inner shells marking the fourth stage of this process .",
    "the key feature of the slow deexcitation is that a significant fraction of the incident potential energy remains to be relaxed as the ion hits the surface .",
    "consequently , dissipation will involve the electronic degrees of freedom of the topmost layers and , by way of electron - phonon coupling , of atoms and ions near the surface .",
    "the final stage is then the creation of defects , heating of the lattice , and ablation of surface material ( `` potential sputtering '' @xcite ) .",
    "+ developing a quantitative description with predictive power for such a complex array of processes has remained a challenge . nevertheless , some progress made to date will be highlighted in the following .",

    "@xcite was developed as an efficient algorithm with , quite often , quantitative predictive power .",

    "the interaction potential between the electron and the surface in absence of the hci is denoted by @xmath28 .",
    "the `` image potential '' due to the presence of the hci is denoted by @xmath29 .",

    "( [ eq:7 ] ) was first indirectly tested ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) by measurements @xcite of the energy gain due to the image acceleration ( eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) ) . since the charge of the projectiles",
    "is reduced by one unit @xmath37 at each successive critical distance , @xmath38 ( eq . ( [ eq:7 ] ) ) , the energy gain along the neutralization sequence ( `` staircase '' ) follows as [ 2 ] @xmath39 in agreement with experimental data @xcite .",
    "similar estimates can be derived for insulators [ 3 ] . + direct test became available with the help of novel targets , metallic nanocapillaries , pioneered by the group of yamazaki et al .",
    "interaction with the internal walls of capillaries allows to select trajectories that avoid a close encounter with the surface ( trajectories of type 3 ( fig .",

    "the peak in the initial state occupation follows the prediction ( eq .",
    "[ eq:8 ] ) .",
    "the cob model hinges on several approximations .",
    "the most drastic ones include : tunneling ( i.e. below barrier ) transitions are neglected since they have small rates compared to over - barrier processes so that they give only a minor contribution to the reaction rate .",
    "atomic states are assumed to exist as resonances near and above the barrier when the electron is classically allowed to escape .",
    "optical dipole transitions within the projectile driven by dynamical polarization fields in the target ( e.g. plasmon excitations ) are negligible since these processes are intrinsically non - classical @xcite . furthermore , despite the slow velocities involved @xmath43 , quantum - mechanical spreading of the wavepacket representing the active electron can be neglected on the time scale during which charge transfer takes place . + to explore the approximate validity of some of these assumptions , quantum calculations have been performed , mostly for singly charged ions , where the reduction to an effective one - electron description is justified and where the density of states to be subtended in the calculations is limited .",

    "this observation of well - defined , yet broadened over - barrier resonances supports the picture of over - barrier capture into broadened projectile states invoked in the cob model . for insulator surfaces , e.g. lif as a prototype ionic alkali - halide surface ,",
    "calculations of atomic energy levels in an environment of localized charges and low symmetry requires methods of quantum chemistry for large molecules at the level of self - consistent field @xcite and beyond @xcite . as contributions due to electron - electron correlations play an important role for the proper ordering of the covalent relative to the ionic levels , relevant for charge transfer , sophisticated methods such as the multi - reference configuration interaction ( mr - ci ) approach @xcite",

    "the projectile is accelerated by the self - image interaction . as electron capture begins to contribute",
    ", the acceleration still continues but is reduced because the charge state of the projectile and its image has decreased and because the repulsion due to holes generated by capture increases . at around 11 a.u . , the hole repulsion starts to dominate over the image acceleration and the projectile slows down .",

    "the emitted electrons at lower energies have a multitude of sources , including slowed - down kll electrons , lower - energy autoionization electrons , kinetic electron emission as well as secondary electron emission .",
    "while above e@xmath114 ev transport and slowing down can account for the polarization observed , the remarkably high degree of polarization ( up to @xmath115 at very low energies is , so far , unaccounted for and awaits a convincing explanation . a spin - filter effect @xcite is a promising candidate but quantitative details remain to be worked out .",
    "conventional sputtering is driven by the kinetic energy deposited by , typically , singly charged ions ( `` kineting sputtering '' ) .",
    "increasing the energy deposition requires , thus , higher kinetic energies which , in turn , leads to deeper penetration and bulk modification .",
    "it was very early realized @xcite that slow hci s promise an interesting alternative scenario for sputtering .",
    "the energy deposited is potential energy ( `` potential sputtering '' ) .",
    "the penetration depth can be kept to a minimum of about one monolyer resulting in `` soft '' sputtering .",
    "the latter notion does not imply that the electronic or lattice structure to remain intact .",
    "quite to the contrary , the first scenario suggested , the `` coulomb explosion '' @xcite of insulator surfaces , suggested a violent distortion and restructuring of the surface , without , however , significant penetration of the projectile into the bulk .",
    "this original proposal for potential sputtering was plagued by several conceptual difficulties : even in well - insulating materials , the mobility of holes , i.e. electronic charge carries , is too fast such that an extended region of high - density charge depletion can not be maintained for a time interval of an electronic sputtering time @xmath116 necessary to convert potential energy into kinetic energy of target ions @xcite .",
    "if one neglects hole mobility , sputtering via coulomb explosion would predominantly emit ionized target atoms with high kinetic energies @xmath117 .",
    "both of these predictions @xcite are at odds with several experiments .",
    "a variant to this scenario , coulomb explosion of hydrogenated adsorbates has , however , been verified : the adsorption of hydrocarbons at surfaces results in the emission of protons which rapidly increases with the charge of the incident hci as @xmath118 . this has been explained @xcite in terms of @xmath119 bond breaking by the hci and subsequent coulomb explosion of the molecule . here , the low mass of the proton and the orientation the hydrocarbon bond sticking out of the surface plays a crucial role in emitting protons sufficiently fast so that re - neutralization on the way out or reconstruction of a bond becomes unlikely .",
    "+    the simple coulomb explosion picture has therefore be amended to yield a more complex scenario : central to a realistic sputtering mechanism is the trapping of the initially generated electronic defects , either by strong electron - phonon coupling to so - called `` self - trapped holes '' or `` self - trapped excitons '' or trapping by lattice defects generated by the incident projectile or already present .",
    "in either situation , the holes or , more generally , the electronic defects become transiently trapped so that potential energy can be converted within time @xmath120 into kinetic energy of target atoms .",
    "this conversion does not necessarily require ionic coulomb interaction and thus allows for the emission of neutrals .",
    "a prominent example are color centers in alkali halides leading to copious emission of neutral li and f atoms ( fig",
    ". 14a ) . even at neglegible kinetic energy , a significant mass removal",
    "is achieved that is proportional to the potential energy , i.e. grows approximately with the charge @xmath121 .",
    "the primary production process of self - trapped holes and excitons has been understood , at least for singly charged ions , in terms of curve crossings ( see sect .",
    "[ quantum ] and refs .",
    "a more complex situation arises in materials where the electron - phonon coupling is weak , i.e. the trapping of primary electronic defects is insufficient to prevent rapid diffusion of holes .",
    "in these materials a different and more generally applicable mechanism has been identified , `` kinetically assisted potential sputtering ( kaps ) '' @xcite .",
    "the essence of this process , examples of which are shown in fig .",
    "14b , is the simultaneous presence of both kinetic energy and potential energy as prerequisite for large - scale ablation to take place .",
    "the efficiency of this process rapidly diminishes when either the kinetic energy or the charge state becomes small .",
    "this observation suggests that it is the kinetic energy of the incident projectile that causes defects ( e.g. lattice dislocations ) along its track which then serve as transient trapping centers for electronic defects caused by the accompanying potential energy .",
    "this interplay , which can be operative in a broad range of materials , makes potential energy induced sputtering a much more wide - spread phenomena .",
    "which , contrary to naive expectation , is not necessarily a crater but can take on the shape of a `` blister''or `` hillock '' @xcite , as seen in afm pictures .",
    "clearly , the appearance on an afm image may not accurately mirror the morphology of the defect as a clear - cut separation between microscopy and spectroscopy is difficult to achieve . in other words",
    ", an electronic defect may appear as a topographic defect @xcite .",
    "moreover , the size of the tip may be insufficient to distinguish the crater from its rim .",
    "[ fig:15 ] also illustrates size dependence of the nanodefect on the charge .",
    "hci are therefore excellent tools to inscribe nano - sized structures into the surface with the charge as control parameter of its size . + future applications hinge on the availability of additional elements of control for nanostructuring .",
    "this is a largely unexplored area of research for potential sputtering . for kinetic sputtering , self - organization of defect structures",
    "have been analyzed @xcite and , in part , experimentally verified @xcite .",
    "bradley and harper ( bh ) have introduced a phenomenological diffusion equation for the height variation @xmath122 the @xmath123 plane , @xcite @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the constant ablation rate , @xmath126 is the ( negative ) surface tension while @xmath127 is the diffusion rate for the surface curvature .",
    "( [ eq:14 ] ) applies to normal incidence .",
    "additional terms with odd powers of the derivate would appear for oblique incidence .",
    "key to nanostructuring is the negative surface tension which describes , on a phenomenological level , the tendency towards spontaneous roughening of the surface under ion impact , i.e. randomly appearing depressions are deepened as they become more susceptible to further ablations than nearby hills .",
    "the microscopic justification for negative surface tension relies on the spike - like energy deposition pattern for kinetic sputtering .",
    "the balance of curvature diffusion which tends to smooth the surface and kinetic roughening results in self - organized nanostructuring .",
    "ordered wavelike patterns have been predicted for oblique incidence . for normal incidence ,",
    "a near - ordered hexagonal spatial correlation pattern in @xmath122 has been recently observed @xcite , clearly pointing towards self - organized ordered nanostructuring ( fig .",
    "[ fig:16 ] ) .",
    "however , such a pattern formation has not been theoretically accounted for in detail .",
    "moreover , translating these observations to potential sputtering is not straight - forward .",
    "its primary energy deposition is expected to be markedly different from spikes along tracks .",
    "the challenge for the future is thus to develop a theory in analogy to the bh approach eq .",
    "( [ eq:14 ] ) for potential sputtering , in particular to explore the existence ( or absence ) of the negative surface tension and to improve the bh equation such as to account for `` crystallization '' of defects in ordered hexagonal patterns .",
