    "in this contribution we consider three - dimensional pistons of arbitrary cross section in the context of kaluza - klein models .",
    "as is well known , pistons have the important advantage that they allow for an unambiguous prediction of casimir forces @xcite .",
    "this is the main reason for the recent surge of interest in these configurations ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    "[ 3 - 7 ] .",
    "most of the research done so far has concentrated on a rectangular cross section with boundary conditions that allow for an explicit determination of the energy eigenvalues for the configuration , at least for part of the spectrum . here",
    "we want to investigate further geometries with arbitrary cross section , along the lines of refs . [",
    "5,7 ] , with boundary conditions leading to a transcendental equation for the spectrum @xcite .",
    "specifically , we will consider semitransparent pistons and we will show that the piston is attracted to the closest wall .",
    "this statement holds independently of the cross section of the piston and of the geometry and topology of the additional kaluza - klein dimensions .",

    "we place dirichlet plates at @xmath2 and @xmath3 and the semitransparent piston at @xmath4 is modeled by a delta function potential .",
    "the energy eigenvalues for a scalar field are then determined by the second order differential operator p = - - _",

    "in addition , we impose continuity at @xmath4 , namely @xmath14 , and the presence of the delta function @xmath15 creates a jump in the derivative , @xmath16 . incorporating all the above information , eigenvalues @xmath17 are seen to be of the form @xmath18 , where the @xmath19 satisfy the transcendental equation ( a ) ( ) + ( l ) = 0.[2]the advantage of this particular representation of the secular equation is that in the limit @xmath20 we immediately obtain the answer for the configuration of two parallel plates at distance @xmath21 .    applying the contour integral formulation of zeta functions",

    "[ 1 ] , the zeta function reads @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a contour enclosing all positive solutions of eq .",

    "[ 3]in writing @xmath24 , the transcendental eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) has been divided by @xmath25 in order to avoid contributions from the origin in the contour manipulations to come .",
    "after deforming the contour to the imaginary axis the representation reads ( s ) = _ _ _ ^dk ( k^2-_^2)^-s d dk f(ik ) [ 4]and our next task is to construct the analytical continuation to a half - plane containing the points @xmath26 ( for the casimir force ) and @xmath27 ( for the functional determinant ) . as usual , the asymptotic @xmath28 behavior of @xmath29 plays the dominant role .",
    "furthermore , the zeta function @xmath30 related to the transversal dimensions , _",
    "n ( s ) = _ _ ^-2s , will make its appearance . for notational simplicity",
    "we assume @xmath31 .",

    "this shows , as @xmath34 , @xmath35 @xmath36 denoting exponentially damped terms . subtracting and adding the leading @xmath37 terms in this expansion , the zeta function @xmath38 is naturally split into two pieces , @xmath39 where _ f ( s ) & = & _ _ _ ^dk ( k^2 - _ ^2 ) ^-s + & & d dk , [ 5]and after performing the @xmath40-integration @xmath41 reads , _ as ( s ) & = & _ n ( s- 1 2 ) - 1 2 _",
    "n ( s ) + & & + _ j=1^m ( -1)^j ( 2 ) ^j _ n ( s+ j 2 ) .[6]as follows from the @xmath42 and @xmath34 behavior , the representation for @xmath43 is valid for @xmath44 where @xmath45 . in the following , choosing @xmath46 respectively @xmath47",
    "we will obtain the results for the functional determinant respectively the casimir force for the situation under consideration .",
    "let us first evaluate @xmath48 and thus we put @xmath46 .",

    "if the eigenvalues @xmath50 can only be determined numerically , then a suitably large number of @xmath50 s needs to be determined numerically and again ( [ 7 ] ) needs to be evaluated numerically .    for the evaluation of @xmath51",
    "we note that the zeta function @xmath30 has poles at @xmath52 @xmath53 , and at @xmath54 .",

    "this is as far as we can go without specifying the manifold @xmath1 .",
    "once @xmath1 is specified , for example as a torus or sphere , the quantities appearing in ( [ 8 ] ) can be evaluated explicitly .",
    "the evaluation of the casimir force @xmath58 is simplified by the observation that the asymptotic terms do not depend on the distance @xmath59 . as a result",
    "only @xmath60 contributes to @xmath61 and a representation for the force is f_cas = 1 2 _ _ _ ^dk ( k^2-_^2 ) ^1/2 f(ik ) .more explicitly we have that h(k ) & = & f(ik ) = + & = & ( + ) ^-1 .[9]noting that @xmath62 as well as @xmath63 for @xmath64 is increasing for @xmath65 , we conclude that for @xmath66 the function @xmath67 is a decreasing function of @xmath40 , whereas for @xmath68 it is an increasing function of @xmath40 .",
