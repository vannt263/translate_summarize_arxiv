    "high  resolution observations in the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen ( hi ) show that the interstellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies is shaped in a very complex way by holes and shells , most of which are expanding ( m31 : brinks & bajaja 1986 , m33 : deul & den hartog 1990 , holmberg i : ott _ et al .",

    "the reader is referred to tenorio  tagle & bodenheimer ( 1988 ) , van der hulst ( 1996 ) , walterbos & braun ( 1996 ) , or brinks & walter ( 1998 ) .",
    "dwarf galaxies have proven to be ideal targets to study the largest of these structures , the sgss , because dwarf galaxies have puffed  up hi disks , show almost solid body rotation and do nt possess spiral density waves . as a result , sgss can form more easily and are not destroyed prematurely , e.g. , due to shear .",
    "we recently reported the discovery of a particularly interesting sgs in ic2574 ( walter _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) which is the target of this study .",
    "although the standard picture to create these structures ( sn and strong stellar winds ) certainly sounds appealing , observational evidence for this formation process is surprisingly scarce : only in few cases are massive o and b type stars visible in bubbles or superbubbles ( see , e.g. , n11 : mac  low _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 , or n44 : kim _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 , both situated in the large magellanic cloud ) . however , in the case of superbubbles , the ages derived for the stellar populations often do not agree with the kinematic ages derived from the expansion velocities of shell structures .",
    "for example , from detailed surveys of the massive stars in lmc superbubbles , oey ( 1996 ) found ` high velocity superbubbles ' containing central stellar associations with ages much larger than the model kinematic ages .",
    "also , searches for the remnant stellar associations near the centers of cavities have not been particularly successful in the past  the standard picture is therefore not without its critics .",
    "e.g. , rhode _ et al .  _",
    "( 1999 ) could nt detect the expected number of remnant a and f stars ( as derived from the observations ) of the clusters which supposedly created the expanding holes in holmberg  ii .",
    "however , stewart _ et al .  _ ( 2000 ) detect ob stellar populations interior to several holes in holmberg ii using ultraviolet data , a direct tracer of the massive stellar component .",
    "another frequently used argument against creation of sgss by stellar associations is the location of some sgss at large galactocentric radii of a galaxy ( where star formation is not expected to play a dominant role ) .",
    "also , the largest cavities found seem to surpass reasonable energy estimates based on single stellar clusters .    since bubbles / superbubbles are often only detected in one or two wavelengths it is difficult if not impossible to make meaningful comparisons with theoretical models .",
    "therefore , in depth multi  wavelength studies are needed . here",
    ", we focus on the sgs in ic2574 (  2 ) and present evidence that this particular sgs has been created by a massive stellar cluster in agreement with the standard picture .",
    "this scenario is supported by new far ultraviolet ( fuv ) observations of this region (  3 ) , which allow us to independently derive physical properties such as energy release and age of the powering stellar cluster of a sgs (  4 ) . some surprising results which also affect the interpretation of other sgss",
    "will be discussed in  5 .",
    "the results and their implications are summarized in  6 .",
    "we aim to shed new insight on the controversy whether or not stellar clusters can create sgss by presenting new observations of an expanding supergiant shell in the nearby dwarf galaxy ic2574 ( hereafter referred to as ic2574sgs , walter _ et al .",
    "the shell has a linear size of about 1000  pc @xmath8 500  pc ( @xmath9 ) and is expanding at @xmath1025  @xmath11 .",
    "it is therefore an ideal target to study expansion models since despite its size it has not stalled yet ( as most of the sgss in other dwarf galaxies have ) .",
    "the elliptical shape of the shell in ic2574 is indicated in fig .  1 .",
    "the kinematic age ( @xmath12 ) based on the observed size and expansion velocity is estimated at 14 myr .",
    "note that this age is actually an upper limit since the shell was presumably expanding faster in the past .",
    "this indicates that the least massive stars that go off as sn are most probably still present in the central stellar association since their lifetimes ( @xmath2 50 myr ) are somewhat longer then the dynamical age of the hole ( @xmath2 14 myr , as derived from the observations ) .",
    "based on our observations and using the models of chevalier ( 1974 ) , we derive that the energy required to produce the shell must be of order @xmath13 erg or the equivalent of about 100 type ii sn ( walter _ et al .",
    "note that in general , all time and shell formation energy requirements are calculated from shell size and expansion velocity ( e.g. , using chevalier s equation , see the discussion in walter & brinks 1999 ) .",
    "however , before we begin interpreting these energies , detailed studies of individual shells must be conducted to insure these calculations make sense .",
    "the available high resolution data as well as the presence of the interior stellar association renders ic2574sgs an ideal target to discern if this commonly used approach is indeed justified .",
    "to do so , we present our analysis of fuv data of ic2574sgs which _ for the first time gives us an independent measure _ of the age and the total mechanical energy deposited by the central stellar association in a sgs .",
    "these numbers can then be directly compared to the energy derived from the observations .",
    "the fuv observations were obtained by the ultraviolet imaging telescope ( uit ) during the astro-2 mission using the broad - band uit b1 filter ( @xmath14   and @xmath15 = 354  ) .",
    "the ic2574 fuv image has 623 second exposure time and spatial resolution of roughly @xmath16 .",
    "the image was calibrated using iue spectrophotometry of stars observed by the uit .",
    "the fuv magnitudes are computed from fuv flux using @xmath17= @xmath18 , where f(fuv ) is the incident flux in erg ( @xmath19  s ) @xmath20 .",
    "the chief photometric uncertainties are in the form of low - level nonuniformities introduced via the development and digitization processes .",
    "uncertainty in the absolute calibration can lead to uncertainties of up to 10 @xmath21 15 % in the fuv flux . a detailed discussion of the reduction of the uit data to flux - calibrated arrays is given by stecher _",

    "2 ( left ) shows a slight spiral signature suggesting new star formation is preferential to the arm - like regions .",
    "the enormous complex to the northeast containing ic2574sgs ( as indicated on the figure ) dominates the fuv morphology of the galaxy .",
    "this complex alone contributes @xmath250% of the total integrated fuv flux of ic2574 .",
    "ccd observations of ic2574 were obtained in the johnson u and b bands , and the kron - cousins r and h@xmath0 bands using the 1.0 m telescope at mount laguna observatory .",
    "the images are median combined with at least two other images having the same exposure time to remove cosmic rays and other defects .",
    "astrometry and photometry are implemented using standard idl procedures for data reduction .",
    "the images are calibrated using published photometry of seven stars in the galaxy field ( sandage & tammann 1974 ) .",
    "the h@xmath0 filter at mlo has a centroid wavelength 6573   with a width of 61   which includes the lines .",
    "the h@xmath0 image is calibrated using fluxes of 20 clearly defined  regions provided by miller & hodge ( 1994 ) .",
    "an h@xmath0 emission image is produced by scaling stars in the h@xmath0 image with those in the r  band image and subtracting the stellar continuum component .",
    "the relative fuv , hi , and h@xmath0 morphologies of the region containing ic2574sgs are illustrated in fig .",
    "2 ( upper right ) .",
    "the fuv emission is coincident with regions corresponding to both the interior of the shell and its rim .",
    "the central stellar cluster ( fig .  2 , lower right ) combined with star formation on the shell boundary suggest the presence of secondary star formation triggered by the expanding shell ( see , e.g. , the models by elmegreen 1994 ) .",
    "note that h@xmath0 emission corresponds to regions on the rim of ic2574sgs while no h@xmath0 emission is present in its interior .",
    "the fuv  band traces flux from an evolving cluster for longer timescales ( roughly 100 myr ) compared to the h@xmath0 ( roughly a few myr ) .",
    "figure  2 therefore already indicates that the central cluster is relatively older than the star formation on the shell boundary ( see also ",
    "this situation as well as the presumed presence of hot x  ray gas in the center of the sgs ( walter _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) makes ic2574sgs a truly unique region and suggests that we have caught this sgs in an auspicious moment .",
    "the morphology of the various wavelengths discussed above suggest that this central stellar association is the powering source for the formation and expansion of the shell as well as for the heating of the x  ray gas . however , this evidence is yet only circumstantial .",
    "therefore , we present some physical properties of the cluster / shell in the following analysis .",
    "we estimate the ages of the single regions on the rim of ic2574sgs as well as the central stellar association from their fuv , b , and h@xmath0 fluxes . a similar approach is used to characterize the ages of star forming regions in dwarf irregular holmberg ii by stewart _",

    "circular apertures are used to identify areas of associated fuv and h@xmath0 flux with the aid of a fuv , h@xmath0 difference image , shown in fig .",
    "the twelve regions are defined by selecting the circular aperture enclosing as much of the fuv and h@xmath0 emission from a single region as possible .",
    "this rather loose criteria obviously neglects to include all the associated flux from a single region and has the potential to mix regions of different populations , but it is sufficient to discern the relative ages of star formation regions ( see stewart _ et al .  _ and references therein ) .    listed in table 1 are the blue magnitude ( m@xmath25 ) , the h@xmath0 flux , the fuv flux , and the fuv magnitude ( m@xmath26 ) for each region .",
    "values are corrected for galactic foreground extinction .",
    "also given in table 1 are the fuv@xmath21b color ( m@xmath26  m@xmath25 ) and log ( n@xmath27/fuv ) .",
    "the latter quantity is the logarithmic ratio of the number of lyman continuum photons , converted from h@xmath0 flux assuming case b recombination , to fuv flux ( where @xmath28 ) .",
    "the fuv@xmath21b color and log ( n@xmath27/fuv )  are time dependent quantities which vary over the lifetime of a cluster and can be compared to model values to estimate an age from the observables .    a single generation instantaneous burst ( ib ) model which employs the stellar evolutionary tracks of schaerer _ et al .  _",

    "figures 4 and 5 show the time dependence of the fuv@xmath21b color and log ( n@xmath27/fuv )  of a model cluster . to illustrate the model dependence on these assumed parameters , we calculate various combinations of imf and metallicity . figure 6 shows the time evolution of log ( n@xmath27/fuv )  vs.  fuv@xmath21b color for a cluster based on the results of figures 4 and 5 .",
    "the figure depicts the model assuming a salpeter imf ( 2.35 ) and an smc - like metallicity , z / z@xmath30 ( as derived for ic2574 by miller & hodge 1996 ) , which is used in the subsequent derivations . here , each point represents one age ( steps : 0.5myr ) , starting with a 0.5myr old cluster in the upper left - hand corner of the graph .",
    "the last point on the lower right represents a cluster of an age of 50myr .",
    "we use this plot to compare the theoretical model with the actual observed values for fuv@xmath21b and log ( n@xmath27/fuv ) . since both axes represent time - dependent quantities , the relationship between the observed value and the model is indicative of the age .",
    "note that most of the observed data points lie off the model since they are uncorrected for internal extinction .",
    "region  1 , however ( the central stellar cluster ; x@xmath31 on the graph ) is not far off the theoretical curve .",
    "this is not really surprising since we do nt expect redenning to play a huge role in this case ( since the cluster is situated within the cavity ) .",
    "the other regions are obviously still embedded in their parental molecular clouds , which nicely explains the higher redenning .    in order to make an age estimate , the observed fuv@xmath21b color and log ( n@xmath27/fuv )",
    "are corrected for internal extinction effects .",
    "the assumed redenning vector is indicated in the upper right of fig .",

    "a@xmath26/e(b@xmath21v)=17.72 ( hill _ et al .",
    "each data point is corrected until the point at which it agrees with the theoretical curve .",
    "the amount of this correction is an estimate of the internal extinction ; the position on the theoretical curve after the correction yields the age of the cluster .",
    "the age obtained using this method should be treated as the mean age of stars in the aperture since a single generation model is used to interpret flux from what is potentially a mix of populations of slightly different ages .",
    "the age estimates are given for each region in table  2 ( column  1 ) .",
    "the observed fuv flux is used to estimate the mechanical energy imparted to the surrounding ism of each cluster over its lifetime .",
    "the fuv luminosity , l@xmath26 , of each region is calculated from the fuv flux after correction for the internal extinction ( derived in  4.1 ) , assuming a distance of 3.2 mpc ( table  2 , column  2 ) .",
    "the mass of each region is then estimated by comparing the observed l@xmath26 with the model l@xmath26 ( erg s@xmath20  m@xmath32@xmath20 ) at the cluster s estimated age .",
    "the derived masses are given in table  2 ( column  3 ) .",
    "evolutionary synthesis models of populations of massive stars given by leitherer & heckman ( 1995 , fig .",
    "55 ) provide estimates of the deposition rates , l@xmath33 , from stellar winds and sn for an instantaneous burst as a function of time and mass .",
    "an average rate of l@xmath34 erg ( s   m@xmath32)@xmath20 is derived for clusters of similar imf and metallicity from the models .",
    "an estimate of the net mechanical energy deposited into the ism by sn and stellar winds , e@xmath33 , can be made by taking the product of l@xmath33 , the cluster mass and the cluster age ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the derived values of l@xmath26 and e@xmath33 are given for each cluster in table  2 ( columns 4 and 5 , respectively ) .",
    "the analysis of the ages of star forming regions indicates a dichotomy between the age of the central cluster ( region1 ) and that of the surrounding regions ( regions 212 ) .",
    "the derived age for the central cluster is @xmath211 myr while the other regions ( which all coincide with the rim of the shell ) range in age from @xmath21@xmath214.5 myr ( average age : 3.1 myr ) .",
    "this is also apparent in fig .",
    "6 where the data point for region1 is found at the lower end of the plot , set off from the rest of the regions . like the comparison between the fuv and h@xmath0 morphologies in fig .  2",
    ", our age analysis suggests sequential star formation on the rim of the shell , triggered by the expansion of the shell .",
    "the age of the central cluster agrees very well with the upper limit derived independently from the observations ( @xmath214 myr ) .",
    "this provides strong independent evidence that the cluster indeed created ic2574sgs .",
    "the mechanical energy provided over the lifetime of the central cluster is estimated to be e@xmath36 erg , roughly a factor of two times the kinetic energy of the expanding shell as derived from the data ( @xmath37 , walter _ et al .",
    "it is now important to compare the total energy estimate based on the fuv observations with previous estimates based on the data only .",
    "based estimates are usually performed using chevalier s equation . in the case of ic2574sgs ,",
    "such an energy estimate is 6 times higher than the fuv value ( @xmath38erg , walter _ et al .",
    "it is not really surprising that these values do not agree better since the model by chevalier is based on the late phase of sn remnants and simply scaled up to supergiant shells .",
    "our result therefore seems to indicate that based energy estimates using chevalier s equation overestimate the actual energy needed to create an shell .",
    "this has important consequences for searches for remnant stellar clusters in other sgss which are based on an expected luminosity of the cluster as derived from the data ( e.g. , rhode _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) . in other words , if our result holds true for other sgss as well , one may overestimate the luminosity of a remnant stellar cluster by almost an order of magnitude .",
    "a multi - band analysis of the region containing the supergiant shell in the dwarf galaxy ic2574 presents evidence of a causal relationship between a central star cluster , a surrounding expanding hi shell , and secondary star formation sites on the rim of the shell .",
    "\\(2 ) the center of the shell is void of h@xmath0 emission while  regions coincide with the shell boundary .",
    "this is confirmed by the fuv , h@xmath0 difference images indicating propagating star formation outwards from the center of the shell .",
    "\\(3 ) a detailed age analysis of the star forming regions reveals that the central cluster is @xmath211 myr and the oldest in the complex .",
    "this age agrees very well with the value derived independently from the hi observations ( upper limit of @xmath214 myr ) .",
    "\\(4 ) analysis of the fuv flux in the central star forming region indicates that the mechanical energy imparted to the ism from sn and stellar winds over the lifetime of the cluster is @xmath39 erg , roughly a factor of two greater than the kinetic energy of the expanding shell .",
    "\\(5 ) the numerical models of chevalier suggest an energy input of @xmath40 erg needed to create the shell , roughly a factor of six greater than the amount of energy input derived using the fuv observations .",
    "the fact that the classical method ( using the models of chevalier ) seems to overestimate the required energy by almost an order of magnitude suggests caution in using it as the basis for determining the required energy input for shells .",
    "this has important consequences for searches of remnant stellar clusters based on the data alone .",
    "\\(6 ) our results support the ` standard ' picture of the creation of supergiant shells by massive star clusters ( even at large galactocentric distance ) .",
    "we conclude that a combination of sn explosions and strong stellar winds are most likely responsible for the supergiant shell in ic2574 .",
    "our results show that indeed massive stellar clusters can create supergiant shells in galaxies ( even at large galactocentric distance ) as predicted by the ` standard ' picture ( creation by sn explosions and strong stellar winds ) .",
    "one intriguing question remains , of course : why do nt we see similar stellar clusters in other supergiant shells in ic2574 as well as in other galaxies ?",
    "one answer might be that in the case of ic2574sgs we were just lucky enough to have caught this particular shell in an auspicious moment .",
    "we speculate that we may have difficulties to detect the central cluster in ic2574 after some @xmath41 years ( a typical age for the largest structures found in other galaxies ) both because of dimming and dispersion of the cluster stars ( since the cluster may not be gravitationally stable after all the gas has been blown away ) .",
    "this would mean that chances to detect similar structures in other galaxies are low , making ic2574sgs a truly unique object to study the evolution of supergiant shells in general .",
