    "recent experiments on hexaborides with divalent metal cations of the alkaline - earth series , namely ca , sr and ba , have revealed some unusual physical properties of these materials . in particular , an itinerant type of weak ferromagnetic order ,",
    "stable up to temperatures between 600 and 900  k , has been observed in and related alloys in a very narrow range of electron doping .",
    "@xcite the electronic properties of alkaline - earth hexaborides place these materials close to a metal - insulator transition .",
    "@xcite this has been confirmed theoretically by recent calculations of the electronic structure of divalent hexaborides which have shown that , with the exception of a small region around the x point of the cubic brillouin zone , the valence- and the conduction bands are separated by a large gap of several ev .",
    "@xcite the slight band overlap is reduced if the inter - octahedron b - b bond distances increase , finally resulting in the opening of a gap over the entire momentum space .",
    "it has also been predicted that the transport properties of srb@xmath3 may be strongly dependent on doping , with changes from a @xmath4- to an @xmath5-type metal induced by slight shifts of the fermi energy around the zero doping value .",
    "@xcite these observations have led to the speculation that the ground state of undoped divalent hexaborides may be characterized by a bose condensate of bound electron - hole pairs , or excitons .",
    "@xcite weak ferromagnetism may then develop because of a spontaneous time - reversal symmetry breaking via doping .",
    "more recent calculations of the single - particle excitation spectrum of , however , have led to the claim that this material is not a semimetal but a semiconductor with a minimum band gap of 0.8  ev .",
    "@xcite if this possibility is considered , the experimental observations , which suggest that binary hexaborides are close to a metal - insulator transition , would indicate the presence of a defect band of itinerant charge carriers . in an attempt to resolve the uncertainties with respect to the correct description of this material ,",
    "we have studied the influence of the chemical composition on the physical properties of cab@xmath3 .",
    "the electrical resistivity , magnetoresistance , low - temperature specific heat and the optical conductivity of stoichiometric and doped samples have been studied and the results have been presented in a previous publication .",
    "@xcite below , we present the results of measurements of the thermal conductivity and the thermopower .",
    "while data on the electrical conductivity and the electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity provide information on the density of electronic states @xmath6 close to the fermi energy @xmath7 , the thermopower may serve to establish the energy derivative of @xmath6 , i.e. , an additional important detail of the electronic excitation spectrum .",
    "one of the samples was prepared in such a way as to obtain material with a close to stoichiometric composition , denoted as .",
    "the second sample , which we denote as , contained a small number of vacancies on the calcium sites , inadvertently introduced during the flux - growth procedure and leading to a certain degree of self doping which is difficult to control .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "after a brief description of the sample preparation and the experimental methods used in this investigation in section  [ sec : experimental ] , we present , in section  [ sec : results ] , the results of our measurements and their analysis .",
    "the conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "binary hexaborides can be synthesized in a narrow range of composition , with the tendency to be boron - rich with concentrations of metal vacancies up to several percent .",
    "stoichiometric crystals can be obtained close to the border of the metal - rich phase boundary.@xcite for our experiments the single crystals were grown by a slow - cooling procedure in aluminum flux  @xcite starting with a nominal ratio cab@xmath8 for the stoichiometric sample , and with cab@xmath9 for the metal - deficient sample .",
    "the crystals were removed from the flux by leaching in a concentrated sodium hydroxide solution .",
    "subsequent etching with hno@xmath8 was intended to remove possible surface contaminations .",
    "the samples on which our transport measurements were made were of prism - type shape with approximate overall dimensions of @xmath10 for and @xmath11 for .",
    "the thermoelectric power @xmath0 and the thermal conductivity @xmath1 of both samples were measured simultaneously by means of a standard steady - state heat - flow technique .",
    "a commercial @xmath12he gas - flow cryostat was used for cooling the sample holder . at one end of a prism - shaped sample , the thermal contact to a copper heat sink",
    "was achieved by using high - conductance silver epoxy .",
    "the sample heater , consisting of a @xmath13 ruthenium - oxide chip resistor , was attached to the other end of the prism by the same method .",
    "joule heating caused by heater currents of the order of a few ma provided the necessary heat - flow and hence a thermal gradient along the crystals . in order to measure",
    "both the temperature difference @xmath14 between two contacts mounted perpendicularly to the heat flow as well as the thermoelectric voltage of our samples with respect to chromel , we used two pairs of calibrated 0.025 mm ( 0.07 at .",
    "% ) versus chromel thermocouples .",
    "@xcite in order to minimize spurious thermal voltages , the thermocouple leads were connected to uninterrupted copper wires reaching three home - built low - noise voltage amplifiers , mounted directly on top of the cryostat insert .",
    "the thermoelectric power @xmath15 of both samples is shown in fig .",
    "[ cab6s ] on linear scales .",
    "the negative sign of @xmath0 clearly demonstrates the dominant @xmath5-type character of the investigated crystals .",
    "the rather large values of @xmath0 , if compared to the typical values observed for the thermoelectric power of common metals , are an indication for the low itinerant charge - carrier concentration in these materials , compatible with the very low values of the electrical conductivity reported previously .",
    "@xcite the overall temperature dependence of @xmath0 is obviously non - linear , with features that are reminiscent of band - structure effects affecting the thermopower of elements and crystalline alloys .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , below @xmath16 and 40  k for and , respectively , the curves show an approximately linear temperature dependence .",
    "a negative thermoelectric power varying linearly with @xmath17 is usually identified as the diffusion thermopower @xmath0 of metals , where the fermi - energy @xmath18 is located within the conduction band . in the free - electron approximation ,",

    "in order to reproduce the observed reduction of the slope of @xmath15 at @xmath22 in the calculation , however , we are forced to introduce a `` feature '' in @xmath40 centered at an energy @xmath47 such that @xmath48 . since the absolute value of @xmath49 decreases above @xmath22",

    "close to the bottom of this band we position an additional band , which may be interpreted as a defect band . with these assumptions , the conductivity spectrum may be written as @xmath50    for an isotropic parabolic conduction band , the boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation leads to @xmath51 where the bottom of the conduction band has been fixed to @xmath52 . by setting @xmath53 in eq .",

    "if the defect states which are forming a band below the bottom of the conduction band coexist with localized states , the latter may act , when ionized , as scattering centers for the electrons .",

    "@xcite the intensity of the phonon scattering processes invoking such states depends strongly on the electronic excitation spectra induced by these defects .",
    "in particular , donor states in cubic semiconductors , leading to the existence of localized singlet - triplet centers just below the conduction band , are also expected to provide the source for a strong resonant phonon scattering .",

    "the singlet - triplet valley - orbit splitting of the fourfold degenerate ground state of as in ge , for example , is 4.23  mev , a value which is of the same order of magnitude as the resonant energies of 10.85 and 9.38  mev , quoted in table  [ fitpar ] for and , respectively .",
    "if the density of defects in the crystal is such that the average distance between the donor states is of the order of the extension of the defect wave function , characterized by a bohr radius of typically 40   , we expect a broadening of the degenerate energy - eigenvalues , finally resulting in the formation of a band of defect states .",
    "the typical extension of the defect wave function should be compared with the expected mean distance between the electrons in , estimated by calculating the third root of the inverse of the electron density derived in section  [ sec : tep ] .",

    "because of the statistical distribution of distances between donor states , it seems possible to realize a situation where both , localized donor states and defect - band itinerant states , coexist .",
    "since stoichiometric is closer to perfection than the vacancy - doped sample , the observation of a stronger high - frequency scattering mechanism in , as mentioned above , might appear as rather surprising .",
    "however , as we noted above , an increasing distance between the defects due to a lower concentration of defects would narrow the tight - binding bands in , eventually resulting in a larger fraction of localized donor states acting as resonant scattering centers for the phonons .",
    "hence , if this scheme is valid , the higher resonant scattering rate in makes sense .",
    "all our attempts to cast the scattering of phonons at localized donor states into a reasonable equation for its relaxation rate and to obtain a fair description of the high temperature features of @xmath93 for failed . this failure may either be due to a breakdown of the debye model at higher frequencies , or may indicate that localized donor states in do not scatter phonons .",
    "with respect to the first possibility it may well be that using the debye model at the frequencies around the resonance is not justified .",
    "a strong resonant scattering mechanism may , in some cases ( see , for example , ref .  ) , modify the unperturbed dispersion relations by opening a gap in the phonon spectrum at the resonant frequency , thus turning the debye scheme into a very poor approximation at the frequencies around the resonance .",
    "this may also be the reason for the poor quality of the fit to the data , for which the resonant - scattering is quite significant .",

    "the functional form of @xmath143 would certainly change .    concluding this section",
    ", we recall that our thermal conductivity data show a strong and somewhat unexpected dependence on calcium vacancy - doping at elevated temperatures , which we interpret as being due to a resonant scattering of the vibrational modes . for a more realistic computation of the thermal transport properties at the high end of the temperature regime covered in our investigation , more information concerning the phonon dispersion relations of",

    "we have measured the thermoelectric power and the thermal conductivity of close to stoichiometric and vacancy - doped between 5 and 300  k. the high negative values of the thermoelectric power @xmath15 of both materials indicate a low concentration of itinerant @xmath5-type charge - carriers .",
    "we have achieved a reasonable interpretation of @xmath15 by using a relaxation - time approximation of boltzmann s equation , by considering a sizeable gap between valence and conduction band states , and by postulating the existence of an additional term in the conductivity spectrum which may be related to the existence of a defect band in proximity to the lower conduction band edge .",
    "a debye - type relaxation - time approximation is successful in describing the thermal conductivity data across the entire temperature range covered in the experiments .",
    "the usual terms contributing to the total scattering rate of the vibrational states agree well with our expectations .",
    "a rather unusual temperature dependence of @xmath93 is observed above approximately 30  k. a resonant type of scattering seems to influence the mean free path of the phonons at these temperatures .",
    "quite surprisingly , its limiting effect on the time period between two vibrational - mode collisions is much stronger in the material closer to stoichiometry .",
    "although postulating a resonant - type of phonon - phonon scattering leads to a satisfactory description of our experimental observation , an alternative possible interpretation which considers the existence of localized donor states is suggested .",
    "since the lattice dispersion relations of have not yet been investigated experimentally , we can not offer any rigorous statements about the physical nature of this resonant type of scattering of the vibrational modes .",
