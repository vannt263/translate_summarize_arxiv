    "initial states of color gauge fields ( glasma ) produced immediately after high energy heavy - ion collisions have recently received much attention . the gauge fields are longitudinal classical color electric and magnetic fields ;",
    "their field strengths are given by the square of the saturation momentum @xmath2 .",
    "the presence of such classical gauge fields has been discussed on the basis of a fairly reliable effective theory of qcd at high energies , that is , a model of color glass condensate ( cgc)@xcite .",
    "it is expected that the decay of the glasma leads to thermalized quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "the glasma is homogeneous in the longitudinal direction and inhomogeneous in the transverse directions .",
    "hence , we may view that it forms electric and magnetic flux tubes extending in the longitudinal direction . in the previous papers@xcite",
    "we have shown a possibility that the famous nielsen - olesen instability@xcite makes the color magnetic field @xmath4 decay .",
    "the possibility has been partially confirmed by the comparison between our results and numerical simulations@xcite .",
    "such decay is a first step toward the generation of qgp .",
    "on the other hand we have also discussed@xcite the decay of the color electric field ; the decay is caused by schwinger mechanism@xcite , that is , the pair production of quarks and anti - quarks .",
    "the mechanism has been extensively explored@xcite since the discovery of klein paradox . among them , the pair production in the expanding glasma has been discussed@xcite .",
    "a new feature in the glasma is that it is composed of not only electric field but also magnetic field parallel to the electric field .",
    "such a feature has also been explored .",
    "in particular , recently there are studies of the back reaction of the particles on the electric field under the presence of the magnetic field@xcite .",
    "the back reaction is essentially important for the decay of the electric field .",
    "our originality@xcite for the investigation of the decay is to use chiral anomaly .",
    "as is well known , the anomaly is effective when collinear magnetic and electric fields are present .",
    "this is the very situation in the glasma .",
    "when we use the chiral anomaly , we can discuss schwinger mechanism without detail calculations@xcite of wave functions but simply by solving classical anomaly equation and maxwell equations .",
    "in particular , when the strong magnetic field is present , the anomaly is much simplified because the quarks are effectively massless and only relevant states are ones in the lowest landau level . ( both @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the glasma are much larger than mass of quarks . ) since the motions of the quarks in transverse directions are frozen , only possible motion is along the longitudinal direction .",
    "thus , the anomaly equation is reduced to the one in two dimensional space - time . with the simplification",
    ", we can find important quantities even in complicated realistic situations for which the investigations have not yet performed .",
    "actually , we have discussed the decay of axial symmetric electric flux tube by taking account of the azimuthal magnetic field around the tube .",
    "the field is generated by the current carried by the pair created quarks and anti - quarks .",
    "although the electric field loses its energy by the pair creation and the generation of the azimuthal magnetic field , it never decays . the field oscillating with time propagates to the infinity in the axial symmetric way@xcite .",
    "this is because the quarks are free particles and there is no energy dissipation .",
    "( in the case of homogeneous electric field , the field simply oscillates with time . )    in this paper we wish to discuss the decay of the color electric field @xmath7 by taking account of energy dissipation in heat baths .",
    "the dissipation arises due to the presence of finite electric conductivity .",
    "namely , the pair production generates color electric current @xmath8 , which dissipates its energy owing to the interaction between the quarks and the surrounding ; the surrounding is composed of quarks and gluons . actually , we assume ohm law @xmath9 with electric conductivity @xmath10 .",
    "the conductivity is calculated by using boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation . in the approximation a relaxation time",
    "is obtained by calculating electron s scattering rates .",
    "then , we can show that the quarks are thermalized immediately after their production as far as their temperature is much smaller than @xmath11 ; the relaxation time of a slightly deformed momentum distribution of quarks becoming the equilibrium fermi distribution is much shorter than the life time @xmath12 of the field . as numerical calculations",
    "have shown@xcite , the longitudinal momentum distribution of the free particles produced in the vacuum is almost equal to the equilibrium one , that is fermi distribution at zero temperature .",
    "thus , even in non zero but low temperature , the momentum distribution is nearly equal to the equilibrium one .",
    "our relaxation time approximation in boltzmann equation may holds in such a situation .",
    "therefore , owing to the energy dissipation by the scattering between electrons and positrons , the electric field decays and never oscillates .    for simplicity , we examine homogeneous electric and magnetic fields of u(1 ) gauge theory instead of su(3 ) gauge theory .",
    "thus , we use terminology of electron or positron instead of quark or anti - quark . the generalization of our results to the case of su(3 ) gauge theory is straightforward done simply by assuming maximal abelian group of su(3)@xcite .",
    "we assume that both the electric and magnetic fields are much larger than the square of the electron mass .",
    "thus , they are taken to be massless .    in the next section",
    "we explain how the chiral anomaly is useful for the discussion of schwinger mechanism .",
    "we apply the anomaly to the discussion of the pair production with energy dissipation in the section @xmath13 . in the discussion we use the conductivity of electron - positron gas under strong magnetic field .",
    "the detail calculation of it is shown in the appendix .",
    "we first make a brief review of the utility of the chiral anomaly . as we will show below , only by simple calculations we can obtain most of important results of schwinger mechanism , which was derived previously by detail calculations .",
    "under the homogenous magnetic field @xmath4 , massless fermions with charge @xmath14 occupy the states characterized by landau level and momentum @xmath15 parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "their energies are given by    @xmath16    where integer @xmath17 denotes landau level .",
    "the term of  parallel \" (  anti - parallel \" ) implies magnetic moment parallel ( anti - parallel ) to @xmath18 . the magnetic moment of electrons ( positrons ) is antiparallel ( parallel ) to their spin .",
    "thus , electrons ( positrons ) with spin anti - parallel ( parallel ) to @xmath18 can have zero energy states in the lowest landau level ; their energy spectrum is given by @xmath19 .",
    "on the other hand , the other states can not be zero energy states .",
    "hence only relevant states for the pair production are states with energy @xmath20 in the limit of strong magnetic field .",
    "hereafter , we consider only such states .",
    "the equation of the chiral anomaly for the states leads to    @xmath21    where @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) denotes number density of right ( left ) handed chiral fermions ; @xmath24 in which the expectation value is taken by using the states in the lowest landau level .",
    "we have used spatial uniformness of the chiral current @xmath25 , that is , @xmath26 .",
    "we note that electrons move to the direction anti - parallel to @xmath27 while positrons move to the direction parallel to @xmath27 after their pair production . therefore ,",
    "both the electrons and positrons have right handed helicity when @xmath27 being parallel to @xmath18 .",
    "( right or left handed helicity means the state with momentum parallel or antiparallel to spin , respectively . ) since chirality is equivalent to helicity of massless fermions , @xmath28 and @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the number density of electrons .",
    "( when @xmath27 is anti - parallel to @xmath18 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 . )",
    "therefore , the anomaly equation describes the pair production rate of electron and positrons under @xmath7 and @xmath4 ,    @xmath33    for example , we suppose that the electric field @xmath34 is switched on at @xmath35 .",
    "then , solving this equation with initial condition @xmath36 , we can obtain the number density of electrons@xcite ; @xmath37 .",
    "when @xmath7 is constant , @xmath30 increases linearly with time . in this estimation , the back reaction of the produced particles to the electric field",
    "is not taken into account .",
    "when we take account of the back reaction , we can find that the electric field oscillates with time .",
    "the back reaction is that the energy of electric field decreases owing to the acceleration of the charged particles .",
    "it can be included by solving a maxwell equation , @xmath38 along with the anomaly equation . to solve the equations , we need to express the electric current @xmath8 in terms of @xmath30 .",
    "this can be done by considering the energy conservation .",
    "namely , the total energy of the electric field and the charged particles @xmath39 is conserved ,    @xmath40    where the energy density of electrons or positrons is given such that @xmath41 with fermi momentum @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "namely , we assume the energy of free electrons and positrons .",
    "their momentum distributions are supposed to be @xmath44 for positrons or @xmath45 for electrons .",
    "we have used the formula @xmath46 in eq([4 ] ) .",
    "thus , from the equation we obtain the electric current @xmath47 for @xmath43 .",
    "obviously , there is no energy dissipation .    using the maxwell equation and the anomaly equation we derive the equation of the number density ,    @xmath48",
    "we can see that after the switch on of @xmath7 , @xmath7 gradually decreases with time , while @xmath30 increases . eventually , these quantities oscillate with the frequency @xmath49 ( plasma oscillation ) as shown in fig.1 .",
    "the oscillation can be understood in the following .",
    "( dash ) and electric field ( line ) with arbitrary scale , width=245 ]    when @xmath7 ( @xmath50 ) parallel to @xmath4 is switched on at @xmath35 with @xmath36 , the number @xmath30 of the particles increases while @xmath7 decreases .",
    "when @xmath7 vanishes , @xmath30 takes the maximum .",
    "after that @xmath7 changes its sign , namely , @xmath7 becomes negative ( anti - parallel to @xmath4 . )",
    "then , the particles are forced to move to the direction inverse to the one in the case of @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the pair annihilation occurs and @xmath30 begins to decrease .",
    "the energy of the particles is transmitted to the energy of the electric field . actually , according to the anomaly equation",
    ", @xmath51 becomes large with time .",
    "when @xmath30 vanishes , @xmath51 takes the maximum ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "subsequently , the pair creation occurs and @xmath30 increases according to the anomaly equation([ch ] ) but with @xmath53 .",
    "this is a plasma oscillation shown in the figure .",
    "the energy of the electric field is transmitted to the particles and then the energy of the particles goes back to the electric field .",
    "the plasma oscillation is a natural consequence of the absence of the dissipation .",
    "we should make a comment on the scales involved in the discussion .",
    "the above result ( plasma oscillation ) holds in the limit of @xmath54 where only the states in the lowest landau level are relevant . on the other hand when @xmath55 , states in higher landau levels become important since the energy @xmath56 of electrons can be much larger than @xmath57 . in the glasma we have both @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( square of electron mass ) .",
    "but states in higher landau levels are still not important according to the following reason .",
    "when some of electrons in the lowest landau level are accelerated and their energies reach the energy @xmath60 , they may make a transition to a state in a higher landau level with energy @xmath61 .",
    "such electrons are the ones produced in the very early stage of the pair production .",
    "the number of the electrons is still a fraction .",
    "most of electrons whose energies are less than @xmath57 , occupy the lowest landau level .",
    "it has recently been shown@xcite that the decay of the electric field is mainly caused by particles in the lowest landau level .",
    "thus , our result is approximately correct .    in this way",
    ", we obtain the number density of electrons simply by using the chiral anomaly .",
    "it is important to note that the anomaly equation involves all of quantum effects .",
    "thus , by simply solving the classical anomaly equation , we can obtain the quantities resulting from the purely quantum effect , i.e. schwinger mechanism . in the standard manipulation@xcite of schwinger mechanism , we need to find wave functions of electrons under the electric and magnetic fields in order to obtain such quantities .",
    "when the time dependence of the electric field is complicated , it is very difficult to obtain the wave functions . on the other hand ,",
    "the anomaly equation is a very simple and powerful tool for investigating schwinger mechanism .",
    "up to now , we have not taken into account energy dissipation of electrons and positrons produced by the electric field .",
    "we proceed to analyse the schwinger mechanism in heat bath , especially , the case with energy dissipation .",
    "we assume that the particles are immediately thermalized after their production .",
    "( later we see that relaxation time , within which slightly deformed particle distribution becomes equilibrium distribution , is much shorter than the typical scale @xmath62 as far as the system is in low temperature . as numerical calculations have shown@xcite , the momentum distribution of the produced particles is nearly equal to the fermi distribution at zero temperature . )",
    "thus , the number density @xmath30 is given by    @xmath63    with @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the inverse of temperature @xmath66 and @xmath67 is chemical potential of electrons or positrons .",
    "the number density @xmath30 depends on two parameters , @xmath68 and @xmath67 , which may be functions of time .",
    "hereafter , we consider only the case that the chemical potential @xmath67 vanishes due to non - conservation of electron number .",
    "it is caused by frequent pair annihilation or creation of electrons and positrons after their production . since initial states have no lepton number , the chemical potential vanishes .",
    "( this corresponds to the situation in the glasma where the pair annihilation or creation of quarks and anti - quarks frequently take place after the pair creation by schwinger mechanism . )",
    "thus , the number density is only a function of the temperature and is given by @xmath69 .",
    "similarly , the energy density is given by    @xmath70    with @xmath71 .",
    "since the temperature @xmath1 represents an average energy of the particles , it is reasonable that we have @xmath72 ; the energy density is equal to the number density times the average energy of a particle .",
    "the electric field produces electrons and positrons and generates their electric currents . when the electric current flows , the current dissipates its energy due to the finite electric conductivity of these particles . thus , the electric field dissipates its energy . here",
    "we may assume that the electric current @xmath8 satisfies the ohm law @xmath73 where @xmath10 denotes electric conductivity .",
    "obviously , the ohm law represents the energy dissipation of the electric field @xmath74 .",
    "as we will show in the appendix , the electric conductivity @xmath10 of the charged particles in the lowest landau level is given by    @xmath75    where @xmath76 denotes the momentum distribution of the charged particles .",
    "the conductivity depends on the relaxation time @xmath77 ; the time needed for a momentum distribution to become the equilibrium one @xmath78 .",
    "the relaxation is realized by scattering of the charged particles so that it can be expressed by their scattering amplitudes .",
    "the detail calculation shows that @xmath79 in the limit of low temperature @xmath80 .",
    "( this fact makes valid our assumption of the immediate thermalization in the low temperature where the relaxation time is small . )",
    "thus , the conductivity depends on the temperature such as @xmath81 in the limit ( @xmath82 is a numerical constant ) .",
    "thus , using the maxwell equation @xmath83 and the anomaly equation @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) , we find that    @xmath86    setting @xmath87 , we obtain the equation of the electric field    @xmath88    with initial conditions @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the number density @xmath91 can be obtained by integrating the solution @xmath92 such that @xmath93 .",
    "the equation ( [ x ] ) describes a motion of a classical particle with the potential energy @xmath94 ; @xmath95 denotes the coordinate of the particle . starting at @xmath96 ,",
    "the particle goes down to @xmath97 along the slope of the potential .",
    "it means that @xmath98 .",
    "namely , the electric field vanishes with the life time of the typical scale @xmath99 .",
    "( the life time of the electric field is sufficiently short to be consistent with phenomenology@xcite of qgp . ) since @xmath100 , the number density @xmath30 or the temperature @xmath66 monotonically increases with time and reaches its maximum .",
    "this is contrasted with the case of no dissipation in which both @xmath7 and @xmath30 oscillate .",
    "these behaviors are shown in the fig.2 .",
    "( dash ) and electric field ( line ) with arbitrary scale , width=245 ]    we can roughly estimate the attainable number density @xmath30 , temperature @xmath66 and average energy of the particles @xmath101 in the pair creation ,    @xmath102    where we set @xmath103 which corresponds to gauge coupling constant @xmath104 in qcd with the energies at rich or lhc .    we should make a comment .",
    "the result has been derived in the limit of the low temperature .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath105 is sufficiently short in the limit so that we can use the equilibrium momentum distribution",
    ". the temperature increases with time from zero after the switch - on of the electric field .",
    "therefore , the result is reliable in the early stage of the pair creation .",
    "however , when it becomes comparable to @xmath106 , the assumption does not hold .",
    "then , we can not use the formula @xmath107 , @xmath105 and the equilibrium momentum distribution .",
    "hence , the result of the saturation in the number density at the late stage of the evolution can not be reliable .",
    "but , as the temperature increases and becomes comparable to @xmath106 , the conductivity is almost constant in time , then , we find that @xmath108 from the equation @xmath109 and that @xmath110 from the anomaly equation .",
    "the number density is saturated and never oscillate .",
    "( to obtain this result we do not use the equilibrium momentum distribution .",
    "namely , the assumption of the particles being immediately thermalized is not necessary . ) actually , when the temperature or the average energy of the particles is comparable with @xmath106 , the electric conductivity may depends weakly on the time because only dimensional quantity in @xmath10 is @xmath106 or the average energy . consequently , we find that the number density ( temperature ) gradually increases in the early stage and is saturated at the late stage .",
    "it never oscillates unlike the case with no energy dissipation .    to put it another way ,",
    "in the early stage when the pair creation starts , the particles are thermalized soon because the relaxation time is short .",
    "thus , the temperature can be defined .",
    "the temperature or the average energy of the particles is much less than @xmath111 . but in the stage when relaxation time is not sufficiently short for the particles to be thermalized soon , the temperature can not be defined . in the stage",
    "all of the typical energy scales are of the order of @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the electric conductivity is also of the order of @xmath2 .",
    "this leads to the above result of the saturation @xmath110 .",
    "the stage is not early stage but may be late stage in the pair creation . in this way",
    "we understand that the results shown in fig.2 are reliable .",
    "we have shown that the color electric field decays into the quarks and anti - quarks under the color magnetic field .",
    "they occupy only the states in the lowest landau level .",
    "we have also discussed that the average energy of the particles is of the order of the saturation momentum @xmath2 .",
    "namely , the fermi momentum , which is the longitudinal momentum , is given by @xmath2 .",
    "the particles obtain the longitudinal momentum with the acceleration by the electric field .",
    "we remind you that the glasma has only transverse momentum of the order of @xmath2 and has no longitudinal momentum owing to the homogeneity in the direction . thus , initially there is anisotropy in momentum distribution . but",
    "owing to the decay of the electric field , the particles have longitudinal momenta of the order of @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the longitudinal and transverse momenta become almost identical to each other .",
    "this is a step toward the isotropy of the momenta or thermalization of the quarks .",
    "the life time of the electric field has been found to be of the order of @xmath0 , while that of the magnetic field by a decay mechanism of nielsen olesen instability is much longer@xcite than @xmath0 .",
    "we may speculate that the magnetic field also decay rapidly due to schwinger mechanism .",
    "this is because azimuthal electric field is generated by the expansion of the longitudinal magnetic flux tube and this electric field decays by schwinger mechanism .",
    "the expansion in the transverse direction of the magnetic flux tube is simply a result of maxwell equations@xcite .",
    "similarly , azimuthal magnetic field is also generated by the expansion of the longitudinal electric flux tube .",
    "thus , both azimuthal magnetic and electric fields are generated around the longitudinal flux tubes",
    ". then , the azimuthal electric field decays in the way as we have shown .",
    "the field strengths of these longitudinal and transverse ( azimuthal ) fields have been shown@xcite to become the same order of magnitudes at about the time @xmath0 after the high energy heavy ion collisions . in this way",
    ", the longitudinal magnetic flux may decay rapidly through the decay of the azimuthal electric field generated by the expansion of the magnetic flux .",
    "such a rapid decay of the magnetic field as well as the electric field is favorable for establishing early thermalization@xcite of qgp .    to summarize ,",
    "we have shown how the electric field decays by schwinger mechanism in the presence of the energy dissipation .",
    "namely , the electric current carried by electrons and positrons dissipate its energy owing to the ohm law , which results in the increase of the temperature with time .",
    "our result holds only in the limit of low temperature , in which the relaxation time has been shown to be much short ; the thermalization of produced particles can be realized immediately after their production .",
    "however , we have also discussed that our result is approximately correct even when the temperature or the average energy of the particles is of the order of @xmath2 .",
    "we show that the electric conductivity behaves as @xmath113 in the limit of the low temperature @xmath114 .",
    "we calculate @xmath10 in the relaxation time approximation of boltzmann equation ,      with @xmath116 , where we have used classical equation of motion , @xmath117 .",
    "@xmath118 denotes relaxation time and @xmath119 does fermi momentum distribution with the vanishing chemical potential ; @xmath120 .",
    "@xmath121 represents a deformed momentum distribution caused by the effect of the electric field . since the electric current @xmath8 is given by              where we denote longitudinal momentum of each particle ( parallel to @xmath18 ) as @xmath15 , @xmath126 , @xmath127,and @xmath128 .",
    "we use the notations like @xmath129 , etc . to distinguish the contributions of different feymann diagrams , which was used in the paper @xcite .",
    "we also use the notations @xmath130 and @xmath131 to distinguish the contributions of the processes @xmath132 and @xmath133 .            where we use the gauge potential @xmath138 of the magnetic field @xmath139 .",
    "@xmath140 and @xmath141 denote spatial lengths in the direction of @xmath142 and @xmath143 axis , respectively .",
    "the states are characterized by two momenta @xmath15 and @xmath144 . using the formulae ,",
    "the scattering amplitudes can be calculated in the following way .",
    "for example , the scattering amplitude @xmath145 of @xmath146 associated with @xmath147 is obtained by estimating the formula ,                                    now we explain that the electric conductivity behaves as @xmath113 in the limit of @xmath114 . in the integrals of @xmath165 ,",
    "we rescale all momenta such as e.g. @xmath166 .",
    "then , we find @xmath167 in which dimensionless quantity @xmath168 depends on @xmath68 and @xmath169 through the dimensionless quantity @xmath170 . using the delta functions we can trivially perform the integration of the variables @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 . among remaining integrations of @xmath174 , @xmath175 and @xmath176 ,",
    "the integration of @xmath174 is finite at @xmath177 due to the factor @xmath178 for @xmath179 . on the other hand ,",
    "the integrations of @xmath175 and @xmath176 are finite at @xmath180 or @xmath181 owing to the factors @xmath182 or @xmath183 and @xmath184 or @xmath185 .",
    "hence , @xmath165 behaves such that @xmath186 in the limit of @xmath187 .",
    "therefore , @xmath188 .    as we have stated before , the relaxation time @xmath189 is quite shorter than the typical time scale @xmath190 in the period of @xmath191 .",
    "thus , we may think that the particles produced by schwinger mechanism are immediately thermalized at least in the early stage of the electric field decay .",

    "<S> initial states of glasma in high energy heavy ion collisions are longitudinal classical color electric and magnetic fields . assuming finite color electric conductivity , we show that the color electric field decays by quark pair production with the life time of the order of @xmath0 , i.e. the inverse of the saturation momentum . </S>",
    "<S> quarks and anti - quarks created in the pair production are immediately thermalized as far as their temperature @xmath1 is lower than @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> namely , a relaxation time of the quarks to be thermalized is much shorter than @xmath0 when @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the quarks acquire longitudinal momentum of the order of @xmath2 by the acceleration of the electric field . to discuss the quark pair production , we use chiral anomaly which has been shown to be very powerful tool in the presence of strong magnetic field . </S>"
