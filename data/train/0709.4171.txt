    "we would like to mention a few of them .    at first , obviously is the case of large initial data in theorem [ thm3 ] which remains open .",
    "notice that the time integrability in the strichartz estimates implies some decay to zero at infinity which is only possible for small initial data , as we know from the keller - segel system @xcite .",
    "a second question is to include some of these examples in a more general assumption such as @xmath272(t , x , v',v ) \\|_{l^\\infty_{loc } } \\leq c \\|s \\|_{l^\\infty_{loc}}.\\ ] ] because this does not include directly de - localization , the methods used here do not apply for global existence .",
    "more related to biophysical interpretation there is a third question : unlike in the keller - segel model  where having turning kernels of the form @xmath273 and @xmath274 gives a repellent drift @xcite and then there is no blow - up , and the existence theory is much simpler  in the arguments carried out in the proof of the results we do not see why it should be better to have turning kernels of the latter form .",
