    "galaxy peculiar velocities are a powerful probe of gravitational physics .",
    "they are sourced by virialized motion within halos and the overall bulk - flow motions due to gravitational interactions , leading to the mass assembly of halos .",
    "although direct measurement of galaxy peculiar velocities is challenging , their correlated effect is imprinted in the clustering of matter through redshift space distortion ( rsd ) , allowing us to determine the linear growth rate of structure .",
    "this quantity describes the growth of matter perturbations through cosmic evolution , containing critical information on cosmic expansion and gravitational physics .    for standard general relativity ( gr ) , in homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies , the growth rate in linear perturbation theory does not depend on the comoving spatial scale @xcite and",
    "can be approximated by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the matter density parameter at redshift @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is a constant . for a @xmath6cdm universe @xmath7 , independently of scale and environment",
    ". this would not be the case for different cosmological scenarios .",
    "for instance , inhomogeneous models of dark energy can lead to patches of clustered dark energy ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) which will have different expansion histories , or certain models of modified gravity such as @xmath8 @xcite rely on the chameleon effect @xcite that suppresses the gravitational force in under - dense environments .",
    "these theories would naturally lead to an environmentally - dependent growth rate and possibly a breakdown of the cosmological isotropy of our universe . as pointed out in @xcite ,",
    "the scale on which the environment is defined is important . for very large under - dense regions ,",
    "the effective cosmological parameters are expected to be different to the global - averaged parameters , but the quantification of this critical scale can also serve as an interesting test for departures from einstein gravity .",
    "a simple test of this physics is to compare the growth rate around cosmic voids to that inferred from galaxy clustering .",
    "in fact , non - linear dynamics are expected to be reduced in cosmic voids compared to galaxy clustering in overdense regions @xcite .",
    "hence cosmic voids can potentially provide powerful tests of cosmology , for instance using the integrated sachs - wolfe effect @xcite ( e.g. @xcite ) , the alcock - paczynski test @xcite ( e.g. @xcite ) or void abundance and density profile ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in this work we test the consistency of the growth rate with environment using rsd measurements around voids and galaxies in the _",
    "6-degree field galaxy survey _ ( 6dfgs ) @xcite , a low - redshift large - scale structure dataset .",
    "there are several advantages to performing these tests near @xmath9 .",
    "first , cosmic expansion is dominated by dark energy , hence a measurement of the growth rate around cosmic voids is a particularly interesting test of dark energy clustering .",
    "second , the impact of the alcock - paczynski effect at @xmath9 is minimal , such that our measurements have little sensitivity to the assumed cosmology .",
    "third , low - redshift surveys such as the 6dfgs have a much higher galaxy number density than high - redshift surveys , enabling a higher - resolution measurement of the density field",
    ". this is particularly important for identifying voids in an unbiased fashion .",
    "finally , the 6dfgs also contains a set of direct galaxy peculiar velocity measurements derived using fundamental - plane distances @xcite .",
    "although we do nt use these measurements in the present work , they offer interesting opportunities for future investigation .",
    "the measurement of the growth rate using rsd in galaxy clustering has been previously investigated for many datasets including the 6dfgs @xcite , the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) @xcite , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite , the wigglez dark energy survey @xcite , the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) @xcite and the vimos public extragalactic redshift survey ( vipers ) @xcite .",
    "these measurements have shown a general consistency with the @xmath6cdm cosmological model , up to a @xmath10 precision , albeit in some cases showing tension with the predictions of the latest cosmic microwave background measurements @xcite .",
    "however , the measurement of the growth using rsd in void - galaxy clustering has not been widely investigated , although @xcite and @xcite recently reported measurements using the boss - cmass sample and vipers , respectively . however",
    ", none of these studies has explored the consistency of the growth rate in different environments using the same galaxy survey .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec2 ] we describe the model we use to fit the measurement of the galaxy - galaxy and void - galaxy correlation functions . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we test these models using mock catalogues . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we apply our framework to the 6dfgs data and deduce constraints on the growth rate in different environments , and we conclude in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "the peculiar velocities of galaxies , @xmath11 , due to the local gravitational potential , result on small scales in random motions of galaxies within a group . by measuring galaxy positions in redshift space",
    ", we can observe the well - known ` finger - of - god ' ( fog ) effect . on large scales , the bulk flow ( coherent infall / outflow in overdense / underdense regions )",
    "is responsible for an overall coherent distortion known as the ` kaiser effect ' @xcite .",
    "the mapping of the position of a galaxy from real space @xmath12 to its position in redshift space @xmath13 is given by : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the unitary vector along the line of sight , @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the hubble parameter at redshift @xmath4 . on large scales , where the matter overdensity grows coherently @xcite",
    ", linear perturbation theory implies that @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the matter density contrast and the linear growth rate of perturbations @xmath20 is defined as : @xmath21 we need to relate the observed galaxy overdensity , @xmath22 , to the matter density contrast , which we accomplish using a linear bias @xmath23 , which is independent of scale in the linear regime .    in what follows we use the notation @xmath24 for the component of galaxy - galaxy or void - galaxy separation perpendicular to the line of sight , and @xmath25 for the component parallel to the line of sight . for both the galaxy - galaxy and the void - galaxy correlation functions , the random small - scale component of the peculiar velocity",
    "can be described by convolving the correlation function with a pairwise velocity distribution @xcite .",
    "the latter is often modelled as a gaussian or lorentzian distribution ; we consider both choices in our analysis .",
    "the redshift - space 2d correlation function due to the coherent bulk flow of peculiar velocity can be described by @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 are legendre polynomials and @xmath28 is the angle between the separation vector and line of sight . in the linear regime @xcite , @xmath29 where @xmath30 , the real - space matter correlation function is @xmath31 , and @xmath32 @xmath33 including our model for small - scale random motions , the total 2d correlation function in redshift space is given by @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the probability distribution of the random pairwise motions . in what follows we model the matter clustering using the non - linear power spectrum from _ camb _ ( halofit ) @xcite and fourier transform it to obtain the non - linear matter correlation function @xmath31 in eq.[theogg ] .",
    "we adopt a fiducial cosmology matching that of mocks a described below : a flat wmap 5-year cosmology @xcite ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) .",
    "the previous effects of the peculiar velocity also apply to the void - galaxy correlation function and we have @xcite : @xmath41\\right ) dv - 1 , \\label{theovg } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the angle - averaged void - galaxy correlation function in real space and @xmath43 .",
    "we calibrate the model using the real - space void - matter cross - correlation @xmath44 measured from n - body simulations ( see section [ sec3 ] ) as our @xmath6cdm template , such that including the linear bias factor @xmath45    for coherent outflow motion , at linear order , the peculiar velocity can be expressed as @xcite : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the average integrated density contrast around voids . for spherical voids we have @xmath48      in this work",
    "we will consider two models @xmath49 and @xmath50 to describe the pairwise velocity distribution @xmath35 in eq.[theogg],[theovg ] : _ model g _ will use a gaussian distribution given by @xmath51 } , \\label{geq}\\ ] ] while _ model l _ will use a lorentzian distribution ( in fourier space ) which corresponds to convolution by an exponential distribution in configuration space : @xmath52 } , \\label{leq}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the standard deviation of the peculiar velocity .",
    "our model hence neglects the scale dependence of @xmath53 @xcite .    a gaussian distribution of peculiar velocities is often assumed for the random motions which result from halo relaxation .",
    "however , numerical studies ( e.g. @xcite ) have shown that a lorentzian distribution can provide a better empirical description of the distribution of peculiar velocities which might result from a superposition of different - mass haloes .",
    "our model hence consists of 3 parameters for both the galaxy - galaxy and void - galaxy correlation functions : the linear bias @xmath54 which enters into eq.[poly],[xibias ] , the standard deviation of the peculiar velocity @xmath53 that enters into eq.[geq],[leq ] , and the linear growth rate @xmath20 that is part of eq.[poly],[vp_r ] .",
    "we note that , in the linear - theory approximation , the fitted values of @xmath20 and @xmath54 are degenerate with the assumed normalization of the matter power spectrum , @xmath55 .",
    "we reflect this degeneracy by presenting our results in terms of the normalized variables @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the rsd models we use in our study , whilst commonly - adopted in the literature , greatly simplify the non - linear physics which will be present on these scales . for example , galaxy bias generally exhibits non - linear , non - local , scale - dependent and stochastic properties @xcite and the galaxy pairwise velocity dispersion may be scale - dependent or non - gaussian @xcite .",
    "however , in the following section we will use mock catalogues to demonstrate that , at the level of statistical precision of the 6dfgs dataset , these simple models are sufficient to extract unbiased estimates of the growth rate from both the galaxy - galaxy and void - galaxy correlations .",
    "many studies have confirmed this conclusion through comparison with more sophisticated models ( e.g. @xcite , in the context of 6dfgs ) .",
    "more accurate modelling of rsd is a significant challenge for upcoming galaxy surveys with much greater statistical precision such as _ euclid _ @xcite .",
    "in order to test our analysis pipeline and the limitations of our models , we measured the growth rate in two sets of mock catalogues . _ mocks a _ are flat - sky mocks with no survey selection function applied , for which we possess the full set of dark matter and halo information .",
    "we used these mocks to model the extraction of galaxy voids from a volume - limited observational sample and the fitting of the void - galaxy correlation function .",
    "_ mocks b _ are curved - sky mocks which incorporate the full 6dfgs selection function via detailed halo - occupation modelling . although we do not have the dark matter information to allow tests of the void sample , we used these mocks to test the fitting of the galaxy - galaxy correlation function to the flux - limited observational sample .",
    "we summarize the creation of these two sets of mocks below .",
    "to generate mocks a , we used a sample of dark matter particles and halos from the deuss simulations @xcite .",
    "these simulations were run for several scientific purposes , as described in @xcite and are freely available .",
    "the simulations were carried out using the ramses code @xcite for a @xmath6cdm model calibrated to the wmap 5-year cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "we used the @xmath9 output of a simulation generated in a @xmath58 mpc@xmath59 box using @xmath60 particles .",
    "in section [ sec4 ] we will extract galaxy voids from a volume - limited sample of 6dfgs galaxies .",
    "we built a series of 20 dark matter ( @xmath61 ) catalogues approximately matching the number density and volume of this sub - sample , by randomly - selecting @xmath62 dm particles a box of side - length @xmath63 mpc .",
    "we also built 20 biased galaxy mocks by sub - sampling @xmath64 halos identified with the friend - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm with linking length @xmath65 , selecting the most massive haloes in order to approximately mimic the 6dfgs selection .",
    "finally , in order to simulate the rsd we used the flat - sky approximation and shifted the positions of the dm particles and halos according to eq.[rsdeq ] , using their peculiar velocities .",
    "we note that , when generating these mocks , it is important to match the dm and halo number density to the galaxy dataset in order to avoid introducing a bias in the identification of voids between the mock and the real dataset .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , the authors show that the density profile of voids is sensitive to the resolution of the simulation .      in section [ sec4 ] we will use the magnitude - limited 6dfgs sample to measure rsd from the galaxy - galaxy correlations .",
    "we therefore supplemented mocks a with a second simulation set , mocks b , which provided a more accurate curved - sky modelling of the survey selection function and redshift - dependence of the galaxy bias .",
    "we built mocks b from the cola n - body simulations introduced by @xcite , using a modified version of the pipeline created by @xcite to construct boss and wigglez mocks . in brief , we first fit the central and satellite galaxy halo occupation distribution of the 6dfgs galaxy sample as a function of luminosity @xcite . by calibrating the luminosity - redshift relation , we defined the redshift - evolution of the hod . through careful comparison of the projected and 3d clustering of the mock and data sample , we iterated the hod parameters to produce the closest possible match .",
    "we then applied peculiar velocities along the line - of - sight , and sub - sampled the resulting distribution with the 6dfgs angular selection function @xcite .",
    "these mocks will be presented in more detail by @xcite .      in our analysis",
    "we identified voids with radius @xmath66 mpc using the void finder developed by @xcite .",
    "this radius is chosen as a compromise between being small enough to obtain sufficient voids for an accurate measurement of the void - galaxy correlation function , but being large enough to select genuinely underdense patches of matter @xcite .",
    "this void finder uses density criteria to identify voids with the characteristic profile illustrated by fig.[fig1 ] . for each of the candidate void positions , which are picked at random",
    ", the algorithm first requires that the overdensity @xmath67 is below a threshold in two central bins , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , where @xmath70 mpc and @xmath71 mpc .",
    "the third condition ensures a ridge of the void profile by requiring that @xmath72 and the fourth condition controls the amplitude of the ridge by requiring that @xmath73 .",
    "we used 10 times the number of candidate positions as tracers , producing a sample of @xmath74 voids for each mock a , which is similar to the number density of voids we find by applying the same algorithm to the volume - limited 6dfgs sub - sample .",
    "we note that about half these voids have some portion of overlap ; this does not affect our analysis because overlap does not change the radial density profile @xcite , and any covariance between overlapping voids is already encoded in the measurement scatter between mocks .",
    "standard deviation computed using the mock catalogues .",
    "the solid and dashed lines show measurements in real - space and redshift - space , respectively , for the dm particles ( black lines ) , the haloes ( red lines ) and the 6dfgs galaxies ( green line , only available in redshift - space ) . ]",
    "we measured the void - tracer cross - correlation functions using the landy - szalay estimator : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the number of data void - galaxy pairs , @xmath77 the random void - galaxy pairs and @xmath78 the number of galaxy / void data - random pairs , in a bin at separation @xmath79 .",
    "the total number of galaxies , voids , galaxy - randoms and voids - randoms are @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively . in all cases we generated random catalogues having 10 times the number of galaxies than our data samples .    the 1d mock mean void - matter correlation function , @xmath84 ,",
    "is displayed in fig.[fig1 ] as the black data points .",
    "we also show the void - halo correlation function ( red points ) , using voids identified in real - space mocks before applying rsd .",
    "in addition we compare the same measurements after rsd is applied ( dashed lines ) , including the 6dfgs measurement .",
    "for clarity we do not show the errors in the redshift - space measurements , which are similar to the real - space case .",
    "we see that rsd accentuates the features of the void profile : it makes the inner density profile steeper and the ridge higher .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this work we provide the first direct comparison of the cosmic growth rate measured in two different environments of the same galaxy survey , by fitting to redshift space distortion in the galaxy - galaxy and void - galaxy correlation functions of the 6-degree field galaxy survey . as a low - redshift survey ,",
    "our 6dfgs measurements are particularly relevant for probing the late - time domination of dark energy , and are insensitive to the alcock - pacynski effect . we find voids using a new void - finder which identifies under - densities matching supplied density profile criteria @xcite .",
    "we also note that our measurement of the growth using rsd around voids is the first performed at low redshift and in the southern hemisphere .",
    "we determine similar growth rate measurements around galaxies ( @xmath85 ) and @xmath86 mpc underdensities ( @xmath87 ) , finding no evidence of an environmental dependence of gravitational physics .",
    "we validate our models , and estimate the errors in our measurements , using mock galaxy catalogues . extracting the complementary cosmological information present in different environments @xcite will be a powerful test of physics for both current galaxy redshift surveys and future projects such as _ euclid _ @xcite .    our analysis could be extended in several ways : direct measurements of peculiar velocities using standard - candle indicators could further constrain their radial profile around voids ; combining our results with analyses of other data sets such as sdss @xcite and gama @xcite can probe these effects as a function of redshift ; and a comparison of our measurements with the predictions of non - standard cosmological models , in particular modified gravity and interacting dark energy models , would place new constraints on those frameworks .",
