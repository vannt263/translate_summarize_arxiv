    "massive stars ( @xmath2 ) play an important role in the ecology of their host galaxies , which belies their rarity .",
    "o stars are generally the dominant source of lyman continuum photons in galaxies , whilst their fast , dense winds are the principal source of kinetic energy in young bursts of star formation .",
    "wolf - rayet stars , the chemically evolved descendants of ob stars , also contribute to chemical and kinetic enrichment of galaxies via their very dense stellar winds , plus lyman continuum photons and ultimately as core - collapse supernova , which further dynamically and chemically modify their environment .",
    "although the majority of our understanding about luminous , hot stars originates from ground - based optical spectroscopy , their energy distributions peak in the far- or extreme - uv .",
    "the first rocket uv observations revealed the characteristic p  cygni signatures of mass - loss from massive stars ( e.g. morton 1967 ) .",
    "longward of ly@xmath1 , primarily @xmath3 has provided observations of a very large database of ob stars , within the milky way , plus magellanic cloud supergiants ( walborn et al .",
    "1985 ) , supplemented by @xmath4 datasets of fainter magellanic cloud stars ( walborn et al . 1995a ; walborn et al .",
    "2000 ; evans et al .",
    "2004b ) whilst only a few early - type stars have been observed in the far - uv prior to @xmath0 , with @xmath5 ( snow & morton 1976 ) and more recently hut ( walborn et al . 1995b",
    "; schulte - ladbeck et al . 1995 ) .",
    "far - uv @xmath0 atlases have been presented by walborn et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for magellanic cloud ob stars , by pellerin et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for milky way ob stars and by willis et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for wolf - rayet stars .",
    "reliable stellar temperatures ( @xmath6 ) for early - type stars are of fundamental importance since bolometric luminosities and ionizing fluxes are extremely sensitive to temperature . here",
    "we first discuss the difficulties involved with deriving stellar temperatures for ob stars , together with the role played by @xmath0 in identifying the inconsistencies from spectroscopic results obtained until recently .",
    "since the uv - optical continuum spectral energy distribution of early - type stars differ only subtly between o2 and b0 stars , the determination of @xmath6 requires the comparison of line profiles of adjacent ionization stages of the same element ( he for o stars , si for b stars ) with model atmosphere codes .",
    "lte model atmospheres ( e.g. kurucz 1979 ) are widely used in stellar astrophysics . however",
    ", this treatment assumes that the ionization state of the gas and the populations of the atomic levels can be obtained from the local @xmath7 and @xmath8 via the saha - boltzmann distribution , such that collisional processes occur faster than radiative processes . unfortunately , the opposite is true in hot star winds , so it is necessary to solve the equation of statistical equilibrium everywhere , i.e. non - lte .",
    "the major complication of non - lte is that a determination of populations uses rates which are functions of the radiation field , itself is a function of the populations .",
    "consequently , it is necessary to solve for the radiation field and populations simultaneously , which is computationally demanding , and requires an numerical iterative scheme to obtain consistency .",
    "unfortunately , the problem is too complex for analytical solutions .",
    "considerable effort has gone into developing realistic non - lte model atmospheres for early - type stars in recent years by a number of independent groups . up until very recently , the non - lte model atmosphere code tlusty ( hubeny 1988 ) or surface / detail ( butler & giddings 1985 ) represented the standard approach for o stars , based upon h - he plane - parallel geometry .",
    "a compilation of properties of o stars based largely upon such an approach was presented by vacca et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "however , two potentially significant effects were lacking in this approach ; ( i ) the atmospheres of early - type stars are not composed of solely h and he , such that the collective effect of metals within the atmosphere may significantly affect the ionization structure via so - called line blanketing .",
    "unfortunately , consistently treating metal ` line blanketing ' in non - lte atmospheres is computationally demanding , although great progress has now been achieved by various groups including tlusty ( hubeny & lanz 1995 ; lanz & hubeny 2003 ) ; ( ii ) the presence of stellar winds complicates the geometry , such that a proper treatment requires spherical geometry .",
    "winds may contaminate ( ` fill - in ' ) photospheric absorption lines in ob stars , causing temperatures to be overestimated still further in the standard plane - parallel assumption ( schaerer & schmutz 1994 ; bohannan et al .",
    "1990 ) .    at present , there are two line blanketed non - lte spherical model atmospheres widely in use that permit ( consistent ) detailed studies of far - uv , uv and optical spectroscopy of o stars , namely cmfgen ( hillier & miller 1998 ) and fastwind ( santaloya - rey et al .",
    "1997 ; herrero et al .",
    "in addition , wm - basic ( pauldrach et al .",
    "2001 ) permits uv spectral synthesis , although presently this lacks an appropriate treatment of line broadening for optical spectral features .",
    "a number of quantitative studies of ob stars were carried out in the last decade in which non - lte plane - parallel model atmospheres for photospheric optical lines of h and he ( to derive @xmath6 ) were successfully combined with spectral synthesis codes for uv ( @xmath9 ) metal lines ( to derive wind properties ) , such as pauldrach et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and haser et al .",
    "however , early release observations from @xmath0 included two mid - o supergiants for which previously optically derived temperatures proved very poor matches to the uv spectral region ( fullerton et al .",
    "in contrast with the familiar nv , siiv and civ saturated p  cygni line profiles from @xmath9 , unsaturated lines from trace ions were covered by @xmath0 , e.g. ciii , niii , siv , piv permitting a greater diagnostic role with regard to the ionization balance of metal species . for the case of sk  80 ( azv 232 , o7iaf@xmath10 ) in the smc",
    ", the metal lines in the @xmath0 spectral window indicated a substantially lower @xmath6 ( by 15% ) than previous helium lines from optical studies ( puls et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "this major inconsistency was ultimately resolved via the use of line blanketed , spherical , non - lte models , introduced above , together with @xmath0 , @xmath9 and optical datasets in which the wind and line blanketing had a substantial effect on the helium ionization balance ( see e.g. repolust et al .",
    "2004 ) , and confirmed the earlier @xmath0 far - uv result for sk  80 ( crowther et al .",
    "subsequently there have been a number of studies of galactic and magellanic cloud o stars based on fastwind and cmfgen analyses of optical datasets , plus uv / far - uv spectroscopy in some instances .",
    "overall , recent results indicate a lower @xmath6 scale for dwarfs , giants and supergiants , as indicated in figs .",
    "[ fig_odwarf ] , [ fig_ogiant ] and [ fig_osuper ] , respectively .",
    "the trend towards 23kk lower @xmath6 is also true for b supergiants ( crowther et al . 2005 ) .    agreement between results from the different model atmosphere codes is good in all cases for which optical diagnostics are included , across each host galaxy .",
    "the principal outliers are results from bianchi & garcia ( 2002 ) and garcia & bianchi ( 2004 ) in which solely far - uv @xmath0 and uv @xmath3 spectroscopy of galactic o stars were analysed using wm - basic .",
    "since it is not possible to compare their predicted optical photospheric lines with observations , caution is presently advised regarding their validity .",
    "in contrast with o and early b stars , recent spectroscopic results for wolf - rayet stars have , in general , led to an increase in stellar temperatures10 or 20 ) rather than the conventional @xmath11=2/3 ] relative to earlier calculations .",
    "current line blanketed models for wr stars ( e.g. cmfgen ) are effectively identical to those used for o stars with winds , whilst previous studies employed non - lte h - he or h - he - cno spherical non - lte models .",
    "why has the temperature scale for wr stars moved in the opposite sense ? blanketing has the effect of re - distributing extreme - uv flux to longer wavelengths such that higher temperatures are required to maintain a specific _ wind _ ionization balance of , say , helium for wn stars or carbon for wc stars .      naturally , lower @xmath6 for ob stars impacts upon bolometric luminosities ( since bolometric corrections are very sensitive to temperature for o stars ) and lyman continuum fluxes , due to lower , softer extreme - uv fluxes . by way of example , in fig .",
    "[ fig_lyman ] we compare recent results for o dwarfs discussed above with calibrations from panagia ( 1973 ) and vacca et al . ( 1996 ) .",
    "we find that the vacca et al .",
    "calibration overestimates contemporary determinations of ionizing fluxes from o stars at all spectral types , whilst the panagia calibration is more reliable at later subtypes , but also overestimates fluxes amongst early o stars .",
    "such revisions naturally have great influence on the stellar content of h ii regions , although the widely adopted n(lyc)=10@xmath12 ph s@xmath13 for o7v stars remains a reasonable assumption ( vacca 1994 ) .",
    "conversely , higher stellar temperatures of wr stars leads to a greater contribution from such stars in the lyman continuum ionization budget of hii regions .",
    "global wind properties of hot stars may be characterized by mass - loss and wind velocity .",
    "the former depends on application of varying complexity of theoretical interpretation , whilst the latter can be directly measured with minimal interpretation .",
    "uv and far - uv p  cygni profiles from metal resonance transitions provide a direct indication of stellar wind velocities of early - type stars .",
    "two approaches are possible  either the maximum blueward extent of saturated ` black ' absorption troughs can be directly measured from observations ( e.g. prinja & crowther 1998 ) , or fit using techniques such as the sobolev with exact integration ( sei ) method ( e.g. haser et al . 1998 ) .",
    "since many far - uv p  cygni lines are unsaturated , black wind velocity measurements from @xmath0 spectroscopy are generally restricted to a few strong wind lines , such as niii @xmath14989991 .",
    "willis et al .",
    "( 2004 ) compare wind velocities of wolf - rayet stars from @xmath0 datasets with literature uv / optical measurements , and find overall good agreement , with the exception of very late subtype wn stars , for which nii @xmath141085 p  cygni profiles indicated wind velocities up to a factor of two times higher than previously estimated .",
    "several techniques are available for the determination of empirical mass - loss rates in early - type stars , involving radio , optical and uv / far - uv observations .",
    "theoretical mass - loss rates have been published by vink et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2001 ) .      for nearby galactic ob stars with strong winds ,",
    "probably the most robust method of determining mass - loss rates is via the thermal free - free excess at ir / mm / radio wavelengths following e.g. wright & barlow ( 1975 ) .",
    "unfortunately , stars with relatively weak winds possess very modest radio excesses , multiple frequency observations are necessary to ensure against non - thermal radio emission from colliding winds , plus no progress with extragalactic early - type stars is presently possible due to sensitivity limits with current facilities .",
    "the radio photosphere of o stars ( hundreds of @xmath15 ) greatly exceeds that from uv / optical emission lines ( typically 12 @xmath15 ) .      optical ( e.g. h@xmath1 ) or near - ir ( e.g. br@xmath1 ) spectroscopy offers a readily available indicator of mass - loss in early - type stars within the local group , subject to difficulties with nebular contamination from hii regions ( massey et al .",
    "the main limitation with such diagnostics are that complex non - lte models introduced above need to be employed for reliable mass - loss rates ( e.g. repolust et al .",
    "alternatively , analytical techniques can be used ( e.g , puls et al . 1996 ) , provided they are suitably calibrated against non - lte model results ( markova et al .",
    "2004 ) .    to date ,",
    "the most extensive multi - wavelength studies of mass - loss , specifically , crowther et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , hillier et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and evans et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have derived mass - loss rates of magellanic cloud ob stars from h@xmath1 observations , and compared predicted uv and far - uv line profiles with observations . with one exception ( azv  235 ) , agreement was very good except that the predicted p  cygni absorption components of pv @xmath141118 - 28 ( in mid o stars ) and siv @xmath141062 - 1068 ( in late o / early b stars ) were too strong .",
    "one was able to resolve the discrepancy either by ( a ) reducing the phosphorus abundance below that expected ( although the sulphur abundance is well known from nebular studies ) or , ( b ) introducing clumped winds in which lower mass - loss rates were able to reproduce the h@xmath1 profile . in general , clumped versus homogeneous models showed otherwise very subtle differences , such that the availability of unsaturated p  cygni profiles in @xmath0 datasets offers the best opportunity to investigate clumping in ob stars .",
    "finally , the sei method can be used to derive optical depths ( or alternatively @xmath16 , where @xmath17 represents the ionization fraction of the specific ion relative to the total for that element ) versus velocity for unsaturated uv and far - uv p  cygni line profiles .",
    "massa et al . ( 2003 ) have analysed a sample of lmc o stars using the sei method . rather than derive mass - loss rates , they instead adopt theoretical mass - loss rates from vink et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to investigate the ionization balance in o stars . from pv @xmath141118 - 28",
    "they find @xmath17(p@xmath18 ) never exceeds @xmath190.2 , such that either ( i ) the calculated mass - loss rates are too high ; ( ii ) the adopted p abundance is too large , or ( iii ) the winds are strongly clumped .",
    "the latter possibility obviously ties in naturally with the above arguments from more complex techniques .",
    "massa ( these proceedings ) discusses recent extensions to this study involving galactic ob stars .",
    "current radiatively driven wind theory predicts a modest dependence of mass - loss rate versus metallicity ( z , vink et al .",
    "consequently , considerable effort is presently underway to establishing an empirical dependence by comparing solar neighbourhood ob stars to counterparts in the lmc and smc , where the metallicity is a factor of @xmath192 to @xmath1945 times lower , respectively .",
    "wind velocities of lmc o stars differ little from galactic counterparts , although a more prominent effect is observed in the smc amongst early o stars ( walborn et al .",
    "1995a ; prinja  crowther 1998 ) . more critically , in fig .  [ owind ]",
    "we present derived wind momenta of o supergiants in the milky way / lmc / smc , _ assuming _ homogeneous winds , with the vink et al .",
    "( 2000 ) galactic calibration ( for @xmath2027.5kk ) , together with predictions for lmc and smc metallicities ( @xmath21 : vink et al .",
    "the comparison appears poor , although modest clumping would resolve the galactic o supergiant mismatch , via a decrease in empirical mass - loss rates by @xmath190.30.5 dex . for the smc supergiants",
    "there is a greater observational scatter , such that some supergiants would agree with the prediction for clumped winds , whilst others would fall far below .",
    "a similar comparison for b supergiants is presented in fig.[bwind ] , now relative to the vink et al .",
    "calibtrations for stars with @xmath2222.5kk ( @xmath23 : vink et al .",
    "in contrast , the measured wind densities of galactic and smc b supergiants fall below the predictions , such that clumping would only worsen the comparison . consequently , significant problems clearly remain , although observationally smc supergiants do show weaker wind densities than lmc and galactic counterparts , although a larger sample size for all galaxies is urgently required for firmer conclusions .",
    "such a study is ongoing via several groups , including our own .",
    "our approach is to combine high quality optical ( vlt / uves ) spectroscopy with far - uv ( @xmath0 ) spectroscopy of magellanic cloud ob stars drawn from the guaranteed time program p117 ( p.i . :",
    "j. hutchings ) plus the ongoing legacy program p511 ( p.i . :",
    "w. blair ) .",
    "finally , let us briefly discuss wr stars . since their winds are denser than ob stars , they offer a great many more wind diagnostics , although as their photospheres are not directly observable , it is necessary to derive their wind and physical properties simultaneously .",

    "wr winds have long been established to be clumped , specifically via the strength of electron scattering wings on line profiles ( hillier 1991 ) , rather than far - uv p  cygni profiles .",
    "in contrast with ob stars , historically no ( heavy ) metallicity dependence of wr winds has been adopted , although crowther et al .",
    "( 2002b ) argue in favour of a metallicity dependence , on the basis of iron - peak lines providing the principal line driving in wr stars ( even within the carbon - rich atmosphere of a wc star ) .",
