    "granular systems are often treated statistically , since the large number of degrees of freedom and the complexity of interparticle forces limit analyses on the particle level .",
    "what are the statistical properties of particles in an excited granular medium ?",
    "in many respects the dynamics of granular media strongly resemble the dynamics of ordinary fluids and solids .",
    "yet there are fundamental differences between granular solids and fluids and their molecular counterparts that make the answer to this question intriguing  @xcite .",
    "ordinary temperature does not lead to measurable velocity fluctuations due to the large mass of granular particles .",
    "when granular particles are excited by an external energy source , their thermal energies are much smaller than their kinetic energies . during collisions between particles , frictional forces and deformation near the points of contact lead to dissipation of kinetic energy .",
    "therefore it is not surprising to find that kinetic energy is transformed into thermal energy when particles interact in an excited granular medium  @xcite .    for strongly excited granular media , assumptions similar to those in kinetic theory",
    "are often made  @xcite . among these assumptions",
    "are that velocity distributions are gaussian and that the mean energy is shared equally among the various degrees of freedom .",
    "however , recent numerical and theoretical research indicates that excited inelastic hard spheres can exhibit non - gaussian velocity distributions @xcite , though the predicted velocity distributions differ considerably from each other .",
    "some thermodynamic descriptions of granular media make use of the concept of entropy  @xcite , or separate the dissipative degrees of freedom from conservative ones  @xcite",
    ".    vibrated granular media have played a special role in efforts to understand the dynamics of granular materials , in part because vibration is a convenient method of replacing the energy lost to friction and inelasticity .",
    "a variety of novel phenomena have been discovered in the past fifteen years @xcite : heaping and convection rolls @xcite , standing and traveling waves @xcite , oscillons  @xcite , and fluidization  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the simple case of a single layer of particles with vertical excitation , varying the fractional coverage of this layer and the amplitude of the driving waveform .",
    "we determine the velocity distributions precisely and compare them to various functional forms , an issue that previous experiments have left unresolved for granular particles that are free to move in three dimensions .",
    "quantitatively studying particles in three dimensions has only recently been achieved in rotated cylinders using nmr techniques ; it yielded important information about the segregation process  @xcite . by observing a three dimensional excited granular medium from above , we are able to focus on the shapes of the distributions of the horizontal velocity components .",
    "a combination of otherwise identical white and black particles allows us to track individual particles even for high fractional coverages at high excitations where particles frequently move over each other .",
    "we measure the dependence of the variances of the distributions on the excitation amplitude , frequency and the fractional coverage .",
    "sharing of energy in mixtures of granular materials is also investigated .    in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the background for our experiments . in sec .",
    "iii we present the experimental setup . in sec .",
    "iv , we show that , in most cases we treated experimentally , the velocity distribution @xmath0 deviates measurably from a gaussian and can be described by @xmath1 .",
    "we show precisely how the variance increases with driving amplitude and changes with fractional coverage @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the coverage for a compact crystal of beads .",
    "the energy sharing between particles of different types is also described here .",
    "a number of studies on excited granular media have addressed the issues of clustering and energy sharing .",
    "numerical simulations and theoretical derivations have shown that the presence of inelasticity in granular flows can lead to the formation of clusters ; as a consequence , equipartition of energy fails @xcite .",
    "experiments performed in a horizontal two - dimensional layer were consistent with this predicted clustering effect @xcite .",
    "vertical one - dimensional experiments and simulations were performed earlier @xcite ; a crossover from a condensed ( clustered ) to a fluidized state was found as a function of the driving acceleration , the number of beads , and the coefficient of restitution .",
    "deviations from equipartition due to clustering are straightforward to understand on physical grounds .",
    "inelastic collisions imply a loss of energy each time a collision occurs . when particles begin to gather in a certain region of space , the rate of their collisions increases .",
    "the rate of energy loss for this group of clustered particles is thus greater , and the distribution of their velocities becomes narrower than that of the particles in less dense regions .",
    "clustering can affect the velocity statistics . assuming a gaussian velocity distribution for a nearly homogeneous granular medium , puglisi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite predict a non - gaussian velocity distribution due to clustering : a superposition of gaussian velocity distributions with different widths . for inelastic particles",
    "this leads to high velocity tails in the velocity distribution which decrease more slowly than a gaussian function but faster than an exponential .",
    "the velocity distributions obtained in a simulation by taguchi and takayasu  @xcite are power laws , resulting from clustering .",
    "these distributions have diverging variance ; this calls into question the notion of a granular temperature , which is generally derived from a variance . in a two - dimensional simulation",
    ", peng and ohta  @xcite found that the velocity distributions deviate from gaussian behavior under the influence of gravity unless @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the height of the region of observation .",
    "@xmath7 is the granular temperature ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , defined as the variance of the velocity ( minus the mean velocity ) @xmath8    the high energy tails of velocity distributions in a homogeneous granular fluid were investigated theoretically by esipov and pschel  @xcite for the unforced case , and by noije and ernst  @xcite for both the unforced and the heated case , based on the enskog - boltzmann equation . in the free case ,",
    "i.e. without energy input into the system , the velocity distribution approaches an exponential at high velocities .",
    "when energy is added to the granular medium randomly and uniformly throughout the system , the high velocity approximation becomes @xmath9 . in order to compare our experimental results to this prediction",
    "we have to assume that energy input into the measured horizontal motion occurs randomly .",
    "while measurements of velocity statistics in an excited granular medium have been carried out  @xcite , few measurements precise enough to distinguish between different functional forms of the velocity distribution exist to our knowledge .",
    "one exception is a recent study of clustering and ordering near a peak acceleration of @xmath10  g by olafsen and urbach  @xcite , who found significant deviations from gaussian distributions , at low and especially at high velocities , where the distributions become exponential .",
    "deviations from equipartition can occur for reasons other than clustering .",
    "for example , knight and woodcock @xcite studied a vibrationally excited granular system theoretically ( without gravity ) and concluded that equipartition need not be observed at high amplitude of excitation due to the anisotropy of the energy source . a two dimensional system ( a vertical hele shaw cell )",
    "was studied experimentally by warr , huntley , and jacques @xcite .",
    "velocity distributions , though roughly gaussian , were checked and found to exhibit anisotropy between the vertical and horizontal motion : the horizontal velocity distribution was narrower than the vertical one .",
    "grossman , zhou , and ben - naim @xcite considered a two - dimensional granular gas ( without gravity ) from a theoretical quasi - continuum point of view and found the density to be nonuniform and the velocity distributions to be asymmetric for  thermal \" energy input from one side .",
    "mcnamara and luding @xcite considered the sharing of energy between rotational and translational motion of the particles , and found a significant violation of equipartition .",
    "the scaling of the granular kinetic energy with vibration amplitude is also of interest in connection with the experiments to be discussed in the present paper .",
    "it has been considered experimentally by warr et al.@xcite , numerically by luding , hermann , and blumen @xcite , and theoretically by kumaran in the nearly elastic limit of weak dissipation @xcite and also by huntley @xcite in a simple model .",
    "the results of these different studies do not seem to be mutually consistent with each other , perhaps because different regimes were explored ; the situation is unclear .",
    "the experiments are conducted in a circular container of diameter 32  cm made of delrin .",
    "it is driven vertically with sinusoidal acceleration at a single frequency @xcite using a vts500 vibrator from vibration test systems inc .",
    "a computer controlled feedback loop keeps the vibration amplitude constant and reproducible .",
    "the frequency @xmath11 used in most experiments is @xmath12  hz and the peak acceleration @xmath13 of the plate is in the range @xmath14 .",
    "the peak plate velocity @xmath15 lies between @xmath16  cm / s and @xmath17  cm / s . the particles are glass beads @xmath18 mm in diameter ( from jaygo inc . ) with fractional coverage @xmath3 . a glass cover at @xmath19 cm height",
    "prevents the beads from escaping from the container .",
    "collisions with the cover are rare for most experimental parameters but lead to measureable changes in the velocity distributions at the largest accelerations , if the coverage is low .",
    "some charging of the glass beads is noticeable when the beads are at rest , but electrostatic forces are negligible at the range of accelerations investigated here .",
    "our objective is to measure the horizontal velocity distributions in an excited three dimensional granular medium for a large range of particle densities .",
    "however , particle tracking becomes increasingly difficult as particle tracks approach each other and cross frequently at large @xmath3 , thus hindering reliable identification of the horizontal positions of individual particles .",
    "however , if only a modest number of particles are reflective , the frequency of collisions between them is small and nearly independent of coverage or excitation . by tracking these test particles",
    "we can also directly compare the velocity distributions for different coverage .",
    "tracking a subset of the particles is accomplished by using some white glass beads among black glass beads . except for the color ,",
    "the black and white beads have identical physical properties .",
    "stainless steel beads of three different diameters replaced the white glass beads in some experiments .",
    "the material properties of all particles we used are listed in table  [ mat - table ] .",
    "images of an area @xmath20  cm at the center of the container are taken at a resolution of @xmath21 pixels using a fast camera ( sr-500 , kodak inc . )",
    "operated at @xmath22 or @xmath23  frames / s . at a vibration frequency of 100 hz",
    "this ensures that images are taken at 5 different phases relative to the phase of the plate vibration yielding the average energy throughout the cycle .",
    "the images are analyzed using idl ( research systems inc . )",
    "first each image is enhanced using a bandpass filter and thresholding to eliminate noise .",
    "the positions of all bright particles are found from the enhanced image by calculation of their centroid ; this defines the particle positions reproducibly to within less than @xmath24  pixels .",
    "small effects due to the finite pixel size are noticeable sometimes as slightly increased probabilities of particle displacements that are multiples of the pixel width ( @xmath25  cm in the physical system ) .",
    "this displacement corresponds to @xmath26  cm / s in most experiments .",
    "the high frame rate ensures that even the fastest beads move less than one particle diameter between images .",
    "this allows accurate tracking of all bright beads for all @xmath27 sequential frames ( the maximum available with our camera ) with a typical precision of @xmath28 for the velocity measurements .",
    "we project each step onto two perpendicular directions , and study the statistics of each velocity component .",
    "one concern was that as a black bead moves over a bright bead , the centroid position could move away from the center of the bead and possibly alter the measured velocity distribution . for a test we thus eliminated particles whose integrated greyscale intensity changed rapidly .",
    "we found that eliminating these points does not measurably alter the velocity distribution .",
    "however , if a collision occurs between frames , our measurements indicate the average of the velocity prior to and after a collision . the measured distribution of velocities will therefore probably be slightly closer to a gaussian than the real distribution of velocities . to improve the data in this regard , it would be necessary to sample faster while retaining the same relative accuracy in the velocity measurement .",
    "it would therefore be necessary to use a faster camera , to zoom in closer to the sample and to extend the measurement over a significantly larger number of frames to obtain the same statistics .",
    "extracted particle tracks are shown in fig .  [ tracksfig ] for @xmath29 ( half of the beads are white ) and @xmath30 g . for clarity , only tracks longer than @xmath31 images are shown , which eliminates some tracks close to the edge .",
    "a total of @xmath27 frames is acquired at @xmath22  frames / s ( i.e. for @xmath32  seconds ) with approximately @xmath31 tracked particles in each frame .",
    "the particle velocities are determined from the particle displacement between consecutive frames .",
    "this does not always represent the true velocity of the particle though .",
    "if a collision occurs between frames , the apparent velocity will be lower than the true velocity .",
    "we can define an apparent temperature based on displacements along either horizontal coordinate denoted here as @xmath33 ; it depends on the time between frames @xmath34 : @xmath35 where the average is taken over all particles ( j ) and frames ( k ) .",
    "the particle tracks obtained at @xmath22  frames / s during an interval of @xmath32  s allow us to determine @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "it is often useful to express the velocities in units of the peak plate velocity @xmath38 , which yields a dimensionless temperature @xmath39 .",
    "[ tempvsframesfig ] shows the dimensionless temperature @xmath40 vs. frame rate ( @xmath41 ) at @xmath42 and @xmath43hz for different accelerations . for small frame rates , i.e. large @xmath34 ,",
    "@xmath40 increases approximately linearly with the frame rate @xmath44 .",
    "this indicates that the particle motion may be described by an ordinary diffusion law when many collisions occur in the sampling interval @xmath34 .",
    "assuming such a diffusion process , one expects that @xmath45 the dashed and the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ tempvsframesfig ] are linear in @xmath41 and give upper and lower limits to @xmath46 .",
    "we estimate that @xmath47 based on the high frame rate limit .",
    "we can now estimate the collision time to be @xmath48 for @xmath49  hz and @xmath42 , which corresponds to one collision every @xmath50 oscillations of the vibrator . on the other hand , for large frame rates ( small @xmath34 )",
    ", @xmath40 approaches a constant .",
    "this occurs when @xmath34 is much smaller than @xmath51 ; in this limit @xmath52 , so the granular temperature @xmath7 ( for displacements along one axis ) can be defined as @xmath53 the approach of the measured granular temperature to a constant can not be fitted by a simple exponential or power law . for an excited granular material , this shape could be influenced by correlations in velocity between neighboring particles and correlations between the local density and particle velocity .",
    "starting from the fact that the sampling time is roughly @xmath54 of the mean collision time at an intermediate coverage , we estimate that the true granular temperature @xmath7 might be up to @xmath54 higher than the measured value .",
    "all values of @xmath7 and @xmath55 presented in this paper are the measured temperatures obtained at the _ highest _ frame rate ( usually @xmath22  frames / s ) , where the limit @xmath56 is justified .",
    "this limit is approached in a very similar way for different accelerations ( see fig .",
    "[ tempvsframesfig ] ) .",
    "this allows us to determine the acceleration dependence of @xmath55 .",
    "note that the collision time can be roughly independent of acceleration since the height of the average bounce increases with increasing peak plate acceleration .",
    "for the fixed number of particles in our system this leads to an increase in the mean free path with increasing acceleration . when the number of particles is changed , the collision time also changes . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3clabel ] , the limit of eqn .",
    "( 4 ) is approached fastest at the lowest energy of @xmath57 and slower at @xmath42 and at @xmath58 .",
    "however , we are close enough to the limit at all coverages ( since the mean time between collisions is always significantly longer than the time between frames ) to observe qualitatively how @xmath55 changes with @xmath3",
    ".    we can therefore determine the dependence of the temperature on plate acceleration @xmath13 and coverage @xmath3 , shown in fig .",
    "[ tempvscovfig ]",
    ". the temperature increases with @xmath13 for all coverages . as a function of @xmath3 , @xmath7 increases at low coverage ,",

    "this trend reflects changes in the true granular temperature as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3clabel ] .",
    "no measurable change in the temperature dependence occurs around @xmath4 .",
    "a fractional coverage above unity is meant to indicate that more than one close packed layer of beads is used .",
    "the highest granular temperature indicates that the average potential energy of the particles corresponds to a mean height above the plate comparable to one particle diameter @xmath60 .",
    "all experimental results are therefore limited to the regime of particle energies smaller than or comparable to the only characteristic energy of a granular material , the potential energy of raising one particle by one diameter @xmath61 . when scaled by the peak plate velocity @xmath62 as in fig .",
    "[ tempvscovsclfig ] , the granular temperature becomes independent of acceleration to within @xmath63 for most data points .",

    "the plot covers two orders in magnitude of the granular temperature , ranging from conditions where beads rarely hit the container lid to conditions where frequent collisions with the lid occur .",
    "we conclude that the scaling of the bead velocity by the plate velocity is very robust and is not significantly influenced by additional contacts with the container lid .      the velocity distribution along one axis , obtained from particle tracks of white beads ,",

    "[ veldist3fig ] compares the distributions for @xmath82  hz and @xmath83  hz .",
    "the distribution falls more slowly with velocity as @xmath11 is increased .",
    "the cause of this behavior is probably the smaller ( unscaled ) velocities at higher frequency , which decreases the collision rate ( i.e. the rate of energy loss through inelastic collisions ) , and the higher frequency of vibration ( i.e. roughly the rate of energy input ) . for the highest unscaled particles velocities and lowest excitation frequency (",
