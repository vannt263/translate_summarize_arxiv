    "superfluid @xmath0he in aerogel , which is a random medium with a high porosity , has been studied as a prototype of impurity scattering effects on an anisotropic cooper - paired system @xcite .",
    "the aerogel has a structural correlation length @xmath1 , corresponding to a typical distance between neighboring strands , of the order of 30 - 50 ( nm ) which is comparable with the pairing coherence length @xmath2 in the pressure range relevant to the superfluid @xmath0he .",
    "for this reason , the scattering events of the quasiparticles due to the aerogel structure are different from those of electrons in amorphous - like dirty metals corresponding to the situation with @xmath3 and seem to be characterized by a _ local anisotropy _ of the scattering amplitude @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", the presence of a high pressure phase with an equal spin pairing ( esp ) , called the a - like phase , has become an active research subject , because it had been believed previously that the b - like phase with the balian - wherthamer ( bw ) pairing is the only stable superfluid phase in aerogel @xcite .",
    "however , several nmr experiments have suggested the presence of the a - like phase near @xmath4 and a strange lowering of the polycritical pressure ( pcp ) accompanying this phase @xcite .",
    "even theoretically , there have been some suggestions favoring the presence of the anderson - brinkman - morel ( abm ) pairing state at least at short scales @xcite by assuming a local anisotropy of aerogel structures , although the lowering of pcp has not been discussed there . on the other hand",
    ", it has been argued that the abm pairing state in aerogel has no superfluid response at long distances , as a consequence of random orientations of @xmath5-vector pinned by the local anisotropy of the aerogel and the resulting proliferation of nonsingular coreless vortices , or vortex - skyrmions @xcite , where the unit vector @xmath5 is the orbital anisotropy axis and expresses the direction along which the energy gap vanishes .",
    "however , experiments seem to show nonvanishing and anisotropic superfluid responses , like in the bulk liquid @xcite . another pairing state , called the robust pairing state , was proposed as a candidate of the a - like phase @xcite showing superfluidity . however , it was difficult to identify this state , which is not thermodynamically stable in the bulk liquid , as the a - like phase .",
    "this controversy on the pairing state of the a - like phase has been resolved in more recent studies @xcite for the cases where the aerogel has a _ global anisotropy _ brought by an external stress .",
    "nmr measurements in both of uniaxially compressed @xcite and stretched @xcite aerogels have been nicely explained by assuming that the a - like phase in these aerogels is in the abm pairing state with a proper alignment of the orientation of @xmath5-vector .",
    "on the other hand , it seems that there is no consensus at present on the pairing state of the a - like phase in the globally isotropic case @xcite . even if the a - like phase in this case is also in the abm pairing state , the fundamental question on the presence or absence of superfluidity in this case @xcite needs to be resolved .    in the present work , thermodynamic stability of the abm pairing state in",
    "globally isotropic random media is examined in details through comparison on the free energy between different pairing states , including the planar and robust states , by assuming some of real aerogels to be globally isotropic .",
    "further , the presence of the quasi long range superfluid order in such a disordered abm state is established at weak disorder where singular topological defects are absent . here , the superfluid order will be reasonably defined through the correlation function @xcite @xmath6 between the spin - triplet gap parameters @xcite , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . here , the zero temperature limit is assumed so that the thermal fluctuation of the gap parameter may be neglected .",
    "further , the overbar denotes the random average , and @xmath9 expresses both of the trace in spin space and the average over the _ relative _ momentum @xmath10 on the fermi surface .",
    "this gap parameter , which is a tensor in spin space , depends not only on the ordinary amplitude and phase but also on the orientations of spin and orbital degrees of freedom of cooper - pairs . at larger scales",
    "than the dipole coherence length @xcite , the spin orientation is locked in the orbital one corresponding to the @xmath5 s orientation , and a short range correlation of the @xmath5 s orientation corresponds to a short range superfluid order measured by the correlation function ( [ corr0 ] ) .",
    "the presence of a _ quasi _ long range superfluid order suggests that the corresponding superfluid correlation length is infinite . at a glance",
    ", one might wonder that such a long range correlation be destroyed by vortex - skyrmions which are generated by _",
    "continuous _ textures of the @xmath5-vector . however , we find based on a renormalization group ( rg ) analysis that the vortex - skyrmions appearing at short scales in globally isotropic systems may be irrelevant perturbations at long distances , implying that a nonvanishing superfluid response is well - defined .",
    "therefore , the a - like phase at weak disorder is expected to show superfluidity , just as seen experimentally @xcite .",
    "a brief sketch on the free energy calculation in the present work has been reported elsewhere @xcite previously .    in sec.ii ,",
    "the ginzburg - landau model including effects of randomness is derived in a form useful for a free energy calculation , and the free energy is evaluated in details in sec.iii based on the gaussian variational method often used in random systems . in sec.iv , the presence of a quasi long range superfluid order is explained by performing one - loop diagram calculations accompanying a functional rg method , and results are summarized and discussed in sec.v . some of technical or numerical details will be explained in appendices .",
    "as a starting microscopic hamiltonian for deriving a ginzburg - landau action or functional , we choose the bcs hamiltonian with an attractive interaction in the purely @xmath11-wave channel , which is written in the familiar notation as @xmath12 where @xmath13 performing the standard decoupling @xcite in @xmath14 by introducing the pair - field @xmath15 , where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) denotes the 3-components of the spin ( orbital ) degree of freedom , the superfluid part of the partition function is given by @xmath18 \\rangle = \\int { \\cal d}\\delta { \\cal d}\\delta^ * \\exp(-{\\cal s})$ ] in the @xmath19 unit , where @xmath20 @xmath21 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & { \\rm h.c . } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath22 denotes the momentum integral @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the pair - field , @xmath25 is the quasiparticle field , and @xmath26 expresses the ensemble average over the quasiparticle distribution .",
    "the gl action is obtained by , in @xmath27 , keeping just the quadratic and quartic terms in @xmath15 .",
    "the pair - field is assumed to be independent of the imaginary time @xmath28 because quantum fluctuations of @xmath29 do not have to be included in considering superfluid phases of @xmath0he in equilibrium , in which fluctuation effects are safely negligible .",
    "for @xmath0he in aerogel , the total quasiparticle hamiltonian needs to include a term associated with an impurity scattering . as usual",
    ", it will be expressed hereafter as a nonmagnetic random potential term @xcite @xmath30 .",
    "the scattering potential @xmath31 has zero mean , and the quasiparticle life time @xmath32 is defined by the relation @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the density of states per spin in the normal state , and @xmath35 denotes the angle - average over the orientation of the relative momentum @xmath10 on the fermi surface .",
    "if the aerogel we assume has no global anisotropy , @xmath32 defined above is independent of the quasiparticle momentum @xmath36 . using a quasiparticle green s function",
    "@xcite @xmath37 defined _ prior to _ the impurity average , the quadratic part @xmath38 of @xmath27 is expressed as @xmath39 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & a_{\\mu , i}^*({\\bf q } ) a_{\\mu , j}({\\bf q } ' ) .",

    "it is sufficient to keep , in @xmath38 , disorder - induced terms related to the @xmath40-dependences of @xmath15 , and the corresponding contributions from the gl quartic term may be neglected .",
    "then , the quartic term in our gl action takes the same form as the familiar one for the disorder - free bulk liquid @xmath0he ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) @xmath41 in the weak coupling limit without any vertex correction , @xmath42 is obtained from the expression @xmath43 expressing the gorkov box of fig.1(a ) , where @xmath44 with @xmath45 is the impurity - averaged quasiparticle propagator .",

    "we need to comment on our neglect in eq.([s4wc ] ) of two types of vertex corrections induced by the impurities .",
    "first , the impurity - ladders dressing the four corners of fig.1(a ) were neglected .",
    "these vertex corrections of the order of @xmath53 are present even in the @xmath11-wave pairing case because we take account of wave vector - dependences of the squared impurity potentials @xmath54 .",
    "however , they merely renormalize the magnitude of @xmath55 and never affects a _ relative difference _ between free energies of two different pairing states . on the other hand ,",
    "irrespective of the pairing interaction , there are also additional diagrams , described in fig.1(b ) , accompanied by a single impurity line .",
    "these diagrams do not contribute to @xmath56 and @xmath57 , while they change other coefficients as follows @xcite : @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is of the order @xmath62 .",
    "as is well known , the coefficients @xmath47 ( @xmath63 to @xmath64 ) appear in a manner dependent on the pairing state in the condensation energy of bulk @xmath0he . hereafter , such @xmath47 s combinations in the abm , bw , planar , and the robust states are denoted by @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , respectively @xcite which will be indicated as @xmath69 in the lump hereafter . in the disordered case ,",

    "further , a pairing state with a small @xmath69 has a lower free energy at the mean field level .",

    "<S> further , it is found through a one - loop renormalization group calculation that the coreless continuous vortices ( or , vortex - skyrmions ) are irrelevant to the long - distance behavior of disorder - induced textures , and that the superfluidity is maintained in spite of lack of the conventional superfluid long range order . </S>",
