    "scientists have been fascinated by wave phenomena and the many common aspects shared by different physical realizations of propagating oscillatory motion , although unique behavior is also accompanying each of them @xcite .",
    "light , electrons , and sound are prototypical examples of waves that reveal profound differences , even at the level of a single - particle , classical description .",
    "this discussion is preceded by a rich literature dating back to the nineteenth century @xcite .",
    "atom and electron waves are at the heart of a long series of studies in thermal - atom scattering @xcite and electron diffraction by atomic lattices @xcite , whereas the discovery of extraordinary light transmission through hole arrays @xcite has also prompted new investigations of sound @xcite and reactivated the field .",
    "the similarities between acoustic and optical transmission have been emphasized by several groups @xcite , but intrinsic differences separate the two kinds of waves , namely : the absence of a cutoff wavelength for the existence of acoustic guided modes , in contrast to the optical case ; the extraordinary shielding of sound near the onset of diffraction @xcite ; and the exotic behavior conveyed by intrinsic elastic modes , with no parallel in optics @xcite .",
    "likewise , matter waves display unique characteristics , as we discuss below .",
    "however , despite the intensity of the debate , no concluding study has been made on the similarities and differences in the scattering of scalar and vector waves by particles and holes , although the accepted emphasis on similarities is a common source of misconceptions .    here",
    ", we confront the scattering properties of particles and holes for different kinds of waves ( light , electrons , and sound ) .",
    "first , we recall that small individual holes drilled in perfect screens are very permeable to sound , but nearly impenetrable for electrons and light .",
    "we then revisit the babinet principle for all these waves , which directly relates the properties of perforated screens to those of particles arrays .",
    "from here , we demonstrate that hole arrays in thin screens can not sustain acoustic or electronic surface - trapped modes , in contrast to the optical case .",
    "these results provide essential tools for exploring other common properties and unique behavior in wave phenomena , some of which are outlined in the concluding paragraph .",
    "the electron wave function , the sound pressure in a fluid , and each of the components of the electromagnetic field satisfy the scalar wave equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the wavevector .",
    "fluid dynamics , schrginger s equation , and maxwell s equations reduce to eq .",
    "( [ waveeq ] ) when describing sound , electrons , and light in homogeneous media .",
    "the difference in the behavior of these types of waves lies in the boundary conditions . for simplicity",
    ", we assume infinite potential boundaries for electrons , hard solids for sound , and perfect conductors for light .",
    "then , the fields at the boundaries satisfy @xmath2 for electrons , the vanishing of the normal derivative for sound , and the vanishing of the parallel electric field and the perpendicular magnetic field for light .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the scattering of sound , electrons , and light by arrays of small particles and holes exhibit dramatic differences that are clearly illustrated by fig .  [ fig1](a ) and by the existence of surface modes exclusively for light ( see a summary in table  [ table3 ] ) . beyond the scope of our work",
    ", we expect the effect of non - perfect screens and multipolar scattered terms to also produce exotic behavior , in particular when non - absorbing scatterers are considered ( for example , real potentials and dielectric materials for electrons and light ) .",
    "acoustic and electron scatterers can be made to resonate through their monopolar or dipolar response , thus leading to new classes of surface modes in arrays .",
    "we hope that our study stimulates further theoretical and experimental investigation in these directions .",

    "in this appendix , we present a simple , self - contained derivation of the babinet principle for scalar and vector waves , which directly relates the properties of any perforated thin planar screen to those of its complementary screen , thus allowing us to extract conclusions on the relation between particle and hole arrays regarding their transmission , reflection , and wave binding performance . the sound pressure reflected by the former screen",
    "coincides with the forward scattering wave function for electrons incident on the complementary screen . for light ,",
    "the field reflected by the former screen for a given polarization of the incident wave coincides with the field transmitted by the latter screen for the orthogonal polarization .",
    "the waves scattered by a thin perfect screen and by its complementary screen are related via babinet s principle . by perfect screen",
    "we understand an infinite - potential wall for electrons , a hard - solid plate for sound , or a perfect - conductor film for light .",
    "the evolution of these waves in a homogeneous medium is ruled by the same scalar wave equation , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the wavevector , and @xmath3 is the wave function for electrons , the pressure for sound , and the components of the electromagnetic field for light .",
    "the fields at the boundaries satisfy @xmath2 for electrons , the vanishing of the normal derivative for sound , and the cancelation of the parallel electric field and the perpendicular magnetic field for light .",
    "the properties of a patterned thin screen ( zero thickness ) and those of the complementary screen are related via babinet s principle @xcite . for an external sound plane - wave , @xmath4 , incident on the first screen [ fig .",
    "[ figam](a ) ] , we can fulfill the condition of vanishing normal derivative by just adding a specularly reflected wave , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the parallel component of the coordinate vector @xmath7 , and the direction @xmath8 is normal to the screen . we still need to impose the continuity of both the wave amplitude and its normal derivative at the screen opening @xmath9 , which can be done by simply adding the following scattered wave : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the green function of the wave equation [ eq .  ( [ waveeq ] ) ] and",
    "@xmath12 is a _ surface charge _",
    "defined on @xmath9 and determined by the condition @xmath13 noticing that @xmath14 we find that ( i ) the expression ( [ psiscat ] ) has vanishing normal derivative in the screen outside @xmath9 , thus satisfying the boundary conditions for fig .  [ figam](a ) , and ( ii ) @xmath15 vanishes at @xmath9 , so that it represents the solution for an electron wave function incident on the complementary screen [ fig .  [ figam](b ) ] .",
    "this means that the transmittance of sound ( electrons ) through a drilled screen coincides with the reflectance of electrons ( sound ) on the complementary disk(s ) .      similarly , the transmittance of light with a certain polarization through a perforated screen coincides with the reflectance of light with orthogonal polarization on the complementary screen @xcite .",
    "this statement of babinet s principle is a rigorous consequence of vector diffraction theory @xcite , but it admits a simpler derivation based upon the symmetry of maxwell s equations @xcite , the solution of which reads , for external electric and magnetic currents @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath20 in our case , the currents are considered to be in the plane of the screen , within a region @xmath9 defining an opening , or a disk in the complementary geometry . in particular , the disk of fig .",
    "[ figam](d ) displays an electric current @xmath16 ( but no magnetic current ) in response to an external plane wave of polarization @xmath21 . using the limit ( [ eqder ] ) for @xmath22 , we find that the rotational terms in eqs .",
    "( [ escat ] ) and ( [ hscat ] ) are perpendicular to the screen outside @xmath9 , and the remaining terms are parallel to it .",
    "this , together with the invariance of the equations under the transformation @xmath23 permits writing the solution for the complementary drilled screen of fig .",
