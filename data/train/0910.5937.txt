    "interpretation of the effective ( mean ) field calculations is one of the most subtle questions in quantum field theory .",
    "it is raised every time one attempts to go beyond the realm of the scattering matrix , and is of vital importance in investigating such issues as the spontaneous symmetry breaking in the electroweak theory , the quark - gluon plasma effects in quantum chromodynamics , particle creation and inflation in quantum cosmology _ etc . _ in essential , this question consists of the following three apparently unrelated parts : 1 ) the gauge - dependence problem , _",
    "i.e. , _ dependence of the effective field on the choice of the auxiliary conditions used to fix gauge invariance , 2 ) measurability of the fields , _",
    "i.e. , _ consistency of the formal field - theoretic predictions with the principal limitations of quantum measurements , and 3 ) the presence of infrared divergences .",
    "the first two of these particular problems are formidable in yang - mills theories , which is why the question of interpretation of the effective field is still far from its resolution there . in quantum electrodynamics , on the contrary , they are relatively simple and amenable to general analysis .",
    "in fact , the proof of gauge independence of the effective quantities such as heisenberg - euler lagrangian , the effective ( mean ) field , _ etc .",
    "_ is not difficult and has been given in quite general form @xcite .",
    "furthermore , measurability of the electromagnetic field was proved in the fundamental works by bohr and rosenfeld @xcite . in particular ,",
    "it was argued in @xcite that the measuring apparatus can in principle be designed so as to take into account radiative corrections despite the presence of ultraviolet divergences .",
    "this consideration was subsequently generalized and carried over to the gravitational interaction in @xcite .",
    "what remains unsolved , however , is the problem of infrared divergences of the fields produced by elementary particles .",
    "namely , it is known very well that the vertex formfactors of massive field quanta , used in constructing effective fields , are infrared - divergent . in this",
    "respect , electromagnetic interaction has many similarities with gravity , in particular , regarding resolution of the infrared catastrophe .",
    "unfortunately , the corresponding proof @xcite of cancelation of the infrared divergences in the s - matrix does not apply to the effective fields .",
    "in fact , the very statement of the problem in the two cases is quite different .",
    "the bloch - nordsieck theorem states that infrared divergences in the radiative corrections to the scattering cross sections exactly cancel those due to the emission of real soft photons . at the same time , the latter do not appear in the effective field formalism at all .",
    "an opinion can be found in the literature ( see , _ e.g. , _",
    "@xcite ) that this problem can be overcome by using the effective potential defined via the s - matrix according to @xcite .",
    "it is known , however , that such definition is highly ambiguous @xcite : there are infinitely many potentials which lead to the same s - matrix , and not all of this arbitrariness can be traced to the gauge freedom in the theory . as a result , even to achieve agreement with the classical theory requires introduction of certain prescriptions at each order of the perturbation expansion .",
    "apart from this difficulty , such a definition would not help investigating the issues mentioned at the beginning .    by this reason , the effective field formalism can be applied , strictly speaking , only to the fields produced by classical sources .",
    "if , for instance , the mass of a charged particle is sufficiently large , radiative corrections to its interaction with the electromagnetic field can be neglected , thus putting the question about their divergence aside .",
    "in fact , assumptions of this kind underlie the classic calculation @xcite and its generalizations @xcite . however , this limitation looks rather unsatisfactory from the theoretical point of view , especially in the light of the positively resolved issue 2 ) above .",
    "this problem is sharpened at finite temperatures , because the heat - bath effects introduce new low - energy singularities to the photon propagator .",
    "these additional singularities are generally believed to worsen infrared properties of the feynman integrals .",
    "previous investigations of the infrared problem have been aimed mainly at generalizing the bloch - nordsieck and kinoshita - lee - nauenberg theorems to nonzero temperatures @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned in this connection that extending the s - matrix formalism to finite temperatures is itself a nontrivial task .",
    "some general results in this direction were obtained in @xcite , where an s - matrix connecting states with different temperature was constructed .",
    "an independent definition of the finite - temperature s - matrix is given in @xcite where infrared finiteness of the s - matrix is proved in the eikonal approximation .",
    "these results were subsequently improved in @xcite .",
    "though in a different way , cancelation of the lowest - order infrared divergences at finite temperature was earlier demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "however , it was argued later that the infrared divergences treated either way still persist at arbitrary temperatures @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that all these developments proceed within the conventional approach based on summation of the scattering cross sections over suitable classes of processes .",
    "as was already mentioned , their results do not apply to the effective fields .",
    "there is an argument often used in the literature , according to which infrared divergences in the formfactors can be discarded within the long - range expansion of the electromagnetic or gravitational fields .",
    "indeed , it is known that the infrared - divergent contributions considered as functions of the momentum transfer , @xmath6 ( which is the variable fourier - conjugated to the distance from the field source ) , are analytic at @xmath7 though infinite , such contributions consequently give rise to terms proportional to the dirac delta - function or its derivatives in the coordinate space .",
    "the divergent part of the effective field thus turns out to be confined to the region of source localization . yet",
    ", this argument can not be recognized convincing .",
    "the point is that such terms appear at every order of the perturbation theory , and each order adds new derivatives acting on the delta - function .",
    "therefore , the question as to locality of the divergent contribution can be settled only after summing the infinite series of differential operators , because the sum of local operators may well turn out to be a nonlocal operator .",
    "turning back to the infrared problem in the general case , we would like to stress that inclusion of the finite temperature effects into consideration is a question of principle : no matter how small temperature might be , it is never zero exactly , and the question as to whether @xmath8 can be replaced by @xmath9 can be answered only by investigating the general nonzero - temperature case . in other words ,",
    "continuity of this sort , being a necessary physical requirement for the very possibility to neglect the heat - bath effects , is to be proved rather than postulated .",
    "it may well turn out that in view of the aforementioned principal inequality @xmath10 the notion of the vacuum effective field is to be defined as the limit of its finite - temperature counterpart for @xmath11 the purpose of the present paper is to examine the infrared problem from this point of view . in this respect ,",
    "our investigation differs from the standard approach based on the high - temperature expansion , which is commonly used in actual calculations ( consideration of the low - temperature case can be found , _",
    "e.g. , _ in @xcite ) . we restrict ourselves to the electromagnetic interaction because its diagrammatics is much simpler than gravitational , and admits in certain cases partial summation of the perturbation series , which can not be performed in the presence of self - interaction of the gauge field .",
    "we introduce a simplified model for a single spatially - localized charge interacting with the heat - bath photons at equilibrium , which neglects the influence of the photon interactions on their statistical distribution .",
    "this simplification is in fact a valid approximation in investigating the infrared problem , because it is the low - energy asymptotic of the photon distribution that is only important in this case , while the radiative corrections to this distribution vanish at zero momentum .",
    "this model requires some modification of the diagrammatic rules , which is described in sec .",
    "[ prelim ] . to examine the infrared divergences of the effective electromagnetic field ,",
    "we use two different regularization schemes .",
    "the first , called @xmath4-regularization for brevity , consists in the usual finite shift @xmath12 of the poles of the electron propagator in the complex energy plane .",
    "this regularization is quite natural in view of the fact that the temperature effects lead to appearance of an imaginary part in the electron self - energy , thus providing an effective infrared regulator which replaces @xmath4 by a quantity @xmath13 this scheme is also very convenient in actual calculations as it reveals some important features hidden in other regularizations , such as the cancelation of counterterm contributions to the effective field , considered in sec .",
    "[ oneloop ] . however , it does not admit factorization of many - loop infrared contributions , which hinders partial summation of the perturbation series . the other scheme , called @xmath14-regularization in what follows ,",
    "is based on the introduction of an infrared cutoff , and is described in sec .",
    "[ lambdareg ] .",
    "this scheme does admit summation of the infrared contributions similar to that employed in the standard treatment of the infrared catastrophe .",
    "this summation is performed in sec .",
    "[ factorization ] . the general conclusion drawn in sec .",
    "[ conclude ] is that both regularizations suggest vanishing of the effective electromagnetic field calculated using the perturbation theory , thus revealing an essentially non - perturbative nature of the infrared problem .",
    "the paper has an appendix where some technical aspects of our work are discussed on the basis of the ward identities .",
    "consider the electromagnetic field produced by an electron of mass @xmath15 which is on average at rest and interacts with the virtual as well as real photons in equilibrium at finite temperature also , the minkowski metric is @xmath16 @xmath17 neglecting the effects related to the quantum spreading of the electron wavefunction , the field is purely electric , so that it is sufficient to find the effective scalar potential @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the heisenberg picture operator of the scalar potential , @xmath20 the hamiltonian of free photons , @xmath21 the electron density matrix , and the trace is over all photon states as well as the single electron states .",
    "the matrix @xmath21 is assumed to describe a non - thermalized state , _ viz .",
    "_ , a state in which the electron is spatially localized . having chosen @xmath20 to be the free photon hamiltonian we thereby omit corrections to the photon distribution due to their interactions .",
    "it is readily seen that within the one - loop approximation , these interactions do not change the effective field indeed .",
    "in fact , in investigating the infrared divergence problem at higher orders they can be neglected as well .",
    "this is because in this case , it is the low - energy asymptotic of the photon distribution that only matters , while the radiative corrections to the photon green functions vanish at zero momentum to all orders .",
    "also , the electron hamiltonian might have been added to the exponent in eq .",
