    "the sunspot number is the solar index most frequently used in the study of long - term solar activity variations and , even more so , in solar - terrestrial relation studies .",
    "the relative sunspot number was defined by rudolf wolf @xcite as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the number of sunspot groups , @xmath2 is the total number of ` spots ' in all the groups on the visible disk , and @xmath3 is a scale factor to bring the number on to wolf s scale ( thus @xmath4 for wolf himself ) .",
    "it would seem that @xmath1 and @xmath2 should be uniquely determined simply by counting and that a @xmath3-factor would not be necessary .",
    "however , different observers - even using the same instrument - may differ in how they overcome variable seeing and arrive at different numbers of groups .",
    "even more so for the number of spots , where the very definition of what should be counted as a spot may vary from observer to observer .",
    "issues here are the distinction between spots with penumbrae and pores without , the treatment of spots that touch each other , different weighting according to size , whether to count all spots or only the larger ones , observer acuity and snellen ratio , etc .",
    "different observers have different answers to , preferences of , and opinions about these issues . with an appropriate @xmath3-factor",
    "their observed counts are , presumably , reduceable to the wolf - scale .",
    "there is some confusion as to the precise meaning of the reduction factor . strictly speaking",
    ", it should only apply to the standard instrument : 8 cm refractor at magnification 64 . to compensate for a larger or smaller telescope an additional factor should be employed . in practice",
    "this is too cumbersome and the additional factor is folded into the @xmath3-factor . for a detailed discussion of these issues",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the f10.7 cm ( 2.8 ghz ) solar index , introduced by covington in 1947 is generally viewed as an excellent index of solar activity @xcite .",
    "the basic minimum level of emission around 67 sfu ( solar flux unit = @xmath5 w m@xmath6 hz@xmath7 ) is presumed to come from the quiet background sun .",
    "an @xmath8-component due to solar activity on time scales longer than those of flares is fashioned into the f10.7 index measured and maintained by the solar radio monitoring programme operated jointly by the national research council and natural resources canada ( http://www.spaceweather.gc.ca/sx-eng.php ) .",
    "routine observations at 1.0 , 2.0 , 3.75 , and 9.4 ghz straddling the 2.8 ghz frequency of the canadian series have been made in japan since the 1950s ( ftp://solar.nro.nao.ac.jp/pub/norp/data ) .",
    "the two microwave datasets [ suitably scaled ] compare favorably with one another and testify to the stability ( to within the accuracy of the measurements ) of the calibration of both @xcite .",
    "in a short 1971 paper , max waldmeier @xcite pointed out that  the zrich standard scale [ of the relative sunspot numbers ] has never been calibrated in an objective way \" .",
    "he went on to note that the close correlation between monthly , and especially yearly , means of the solar microwave emission at 10.7 cm wavelength and the sunspot numbers yields a possibility of an objective calibration of the scale of the relative sunspot numbers .",
    "figure  [ f - relation ] shows the tight relationship [ linear for sunspot number greater than 25 ] deduced by waldmeier for the interval 1947 - 1970 ( black dots ) .",
    "he remarks that  as long as this relation holds , the zrich series of sunspot - numbers may be considered to be homogeneous .",
    "if this relation should be subject to changes in the time to come , then the reduction factor used hitherto ought to be changed in such a way that the old r - f relation is reestablished \" .",
    "figure  [ f - relation ] also shows the relation since 1996 derived from the international sunspot number as determined by sidc ( red dots , http://sidc.oma.be/data/yearssn.dat ) .",
    "the data for the intervening interval 1971 - 1995 are shown as gray dots and open red squares .",
    "it is clear that the recent sunspot numbers no longer follow the relationship found by waldmeier and that therefore , perhaps , ",
    "the reduction factor used hitherto ought to be changed in such a way that the old r - f relation is reestablished \" . on the other hand",
    "it is also possible that the sunspot number as currently defined simply is no longer a suitable measure of solar activity , given the progressive discrepancy with the f10.7 flux .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite and @xcite based on monthly values .",
    "one can speculate that the reason for this is the recent reduced visibility of sunspots due to diminished contrast to the surrounding photosphere reported by @xcite on account of weaker magnetic field and increased temperature .",
    "recent measurements appear to confirm those trends as seen in figure  [ f - umbral ] [ livingston , personal communication ] .",
    "should such deviations from ` normal ' observed sunspot activity be substantiated in the near future , the question naturally arises whether [ and when ] they might have occurred in the past as well , _",
    "e.g. _ during the maunder minimum , 1645 - 1715 .",
    "i thank bill livingston for his measurements of umbral magnetic field and intensities .",
    "i acknowledge the use of sunspot data from sidc , rwc belgium , world data center for the sunspot index , royal observatory of belgium . and of f10.7 cm flux from national research council and natural resources , canada .",
