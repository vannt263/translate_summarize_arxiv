    "nonthermal radiation observed from astrophysical systems containing relativistic jets and shocks , e.g. , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , and galactic microquasar systems usually has power - law emission spectra . in most of these systems ,",
    "the emission is thought to be generated by accelerated electrons through the synchrotron and/or inverse compton mechanisms .",
    "radiation from these systems is observed in the radio through the gamma - ray region .",
    "radiation in optical and higher frequencies typically requires particle re - acceleration in order to counter radiative losses .",
    "particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations can shed light on the physical mechanism of particle acceleration that occurs in the complicated dynamics within relativistic shocks .",
    "recent pic simulations using injected relativistic electron - ion jets show that acceleration occurs within the downstream jet , rather than by the scattering of particles back and forth across the shock as in fermi acceleration [ 1 - 7 ] . in general , these independent simulations have confirmed that relativistic jets excite the weibel instability [ 8 ] .",
    "the weibel instability generates current filaments with associated magnetic fields [ 9 ] , and accelerates electrons [ 1 - 7 ] .    in this paper",
    "we present new simulation results of particle acceleration and magnetic field generation for relativistic electron - positron shocks using 3-d relativistic electromagnetic particle - in - cell ( remp ) simulations . in our new simulations , the growthrates with different lorentz factors of jets",
    "have been studied without an initial ambient magnetic field .",
    "two simulations were performed using an @xmath0 grid with a total of 180 million particles ( 27 particles@xmath1cell@xmath1species for the ambient plasma ) and an electron skin depth , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the electron plasma frequency and @xmath4 is the grid size ( nishikawa et al .",

    "the average jet velocities for the two simulations are @xmath7 corresponding to lorentz factors are 5 ( 2.5 mev ) and 15 ( 7.5 mev ) , respectively .",

    "the maximum values of @xmath17 are ( a ) 15.63 and ( b ) 3.86 , respectively .",
    "the slower jet shows larger amplitudes than the faster jet at the same simulation time .",
    "the effect of lorentz factors of jets affects the growth rates of weibel instability as expected by the theory [ 8 ] .",
    "the differences in the growthrates between the differerent lorentz factors are seen more clearly in the @xmath18-component of the generated magnetic fields as shown in fig .",

    "we have performed self - consistent , three - dimensional relativistic particle simulations of relativistic electron - positron jets propagating into magnetized and unmagnetized electron - positron ambient plasmas .",
    "the main acceleration of electrons takes place in the region behind the shock front [ 5 ] .",
    "processes in the relativistic collisionless shock are dominated by structures produced by the weibel instability .",
    "this instability is excited in the downstream region behind the jet head , where electron density perturbations lead to the formation of current filaments .",
    "the nonuniform electric field and magnetic field structures associated with these current filaments decelerate the jet electrons and positrons , while accelerating the ambient electrons and positrons , and accelerating ( heating ) the jet and ambient electrons and positrons in the transverse direction .",
    "the growthrates depend on the lorentz factors of jet as expected by the theory [ 9 ] . the @xmath29-fold time is written as @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the lorentz factor of the shock .",
