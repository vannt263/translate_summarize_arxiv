    "the recent progresses in nanotechnology have allowed to envision building crystals with designed properties from bottom - up .",
    "this procedure , generally labeled as crystal engineering , could become a reality within the current available technologies if a number of conditions are properly observed @xcite .",
    "the molecular building blocks ( mbbs ) , the fundamental nanobricks , must carry strong intra - molecular bonding in order to guarantee internal molecular rigidity @xcite .",
    "moreover , the mbbs must contain appropriate chemical active centers to provide attractive and strong inter - molecular bonding , which ensures rigidity for the entire crystal .",
    "although getting mbbs with those properties might be reasonably easy to achieve , the major challenge has been the synthesis , the process in which those mbbs are put together in organized and systematic fashion .",
    "there are essentially two ways to arrange them : physics- and chemistry - oriented methods .",
    "physics methods , such as the atomic force microscopy , are used to manipulate single molecules onto surfaces , allowing positional control with sub - nanometric precision . however , those methods are fundamentally too slow because the molecules are manipulated individually and in sequence . on the other hand , chemistry methods , such as self - assembly ,",
    "are more appealing to build nanocrystals in large scale .",
    "the appropriate choice of mbbs is crucial in crystal engineering .",
    "carbon - based nanostructures , such as nanotubes , buckballs , and polymers , have been considered as leading candidates to work as mbbs @xcite .",
    "diamondoids , also known as molecular diamond , have been recently included in this list of candidates @xcite .",
    "although diamondoids have been known for a long time , they have received great attention only after recent developments that allowed to manipulate and separate higher diamondoids @xcite .",
    "diamondoids face a major challenge to be used in crystal engineering , since molecular crystals made of pristine diamondoids have weak inter - molecular bonding and , consequently , are very brittle @xcite .",
    "an additional challenge is to find a microscopic driving force to favor self - assembly .",
    "chemical functionalization is a process in which those two points could be simultaneously addressed .",
    "for example , functionalized diamondoids could work as mbbs that can self - organize , using the inter - molecular interactions between chemically active sites in different functionalized molecules as the driving forces @xcite .",
    "the resulting crystals could have strong inter - molecular bonds when compared to hydrogen - hydrogen interactions , that control inter - molecular bonding in typical molecular crystals .    in order to explore the concept of using functionalized diamondoids as mbbs , we used first principles calculations to devise crystals made of functionalized adamantane molecules with boron and/or nitrogen atoms .",
    "we found that the resulting crystals carried large cohesive energies and bulk moduli , which was a direct consequence of functionalization @xcite .",
    "additionally , those crystals present wide bandgaps and low dielectric constants , equivalent to properties of molecular crystals made of pristine adamantane @xcite .",
    "all those properties allow to envision widespread applications , ranging from nano - electro - mechanical systems ( nems ) to insulating dielectrics in nanodevice interconnects or opto - electronic devices .",
    "this manuscript is organized as follows : section [ sec2 ] presents the methodological aspects of the simulations , section [ sec3 ] presents the structural , electronic and optical properties of the molecular crystals , discussing the role of functionalization .",
    "finally , section [ sec4 ] discusses the potential applications for those crystalline structures .",
    "the calculations were performed using the vasp package ( vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package ) @xcite with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the electronic exchange - correlation potential was described within the density functional theory in the generalized gradient approximation @xcite .",
    "the electronic wave - functions were described by a projector augmented wave ( paw ) method @xcite , taking a plane - wave basis set with an energy cutoff of 450 ev .",
    "convergence in total energy was set to 0.1 mev / atom between two self - consistent iterations . for a crystal in a certain lattice parameter ,",
    "configurational optimization was performed by considering relaxation in all atoms , without any symmetry constrain , until forces were lower than 3 mev /   in any atom .",
    "the brillouin zone was sampled by a monkhorst - pack grid of about 100 k - points @xcite .",
    "the complex dielectric tensors were computed within the framework of the random phase approximation @xcite . the dielectric constant ( @xmath0 )",
    "was computed as the photon zero - energy limit of the real part of the dielectric tensor .",
    "the reliability of our results using this solid - state - based methodology was checked by comparing the properties of isolated adamantane molecules , in pristine and functionalized forms , with the ones using a chemistry - based methodology @xcite . in terms of structural properties of all molecules ,",
    "both methodologies provide results for interatomic distances ( differences lower than 0.01  ) and angles ( differences lower than 0.1@xmath1 ) in excellent agreement with each other .",
    "adamantane , the smallest diamondoid , has a c@xmath2h@xmath3 chemical composition , which comprises of one diamond - like carbon cage with hydrogen atoms passivating the remaining bonds .",
    "it contains two types of carbon atoms : four c(1 ) and six c(2 ) atoms .",
    "a c(1 ) is bound to three c(2 ) s and one h atom , while a c(2 ) is bound to two c(1 ) s and two h s .",
    "figure [ fig1]a presents the structure and schematic representation of an adamantane molecule .",
    "functionalization in the c(1 ) or c(2 ) sites provides respectively four or six chemically active sites to allow inter - molecular bonding . in principle",
    ", a larger number of functionalized sites , such as the c(2 ) ones , would be desirable , since it could lead to a larger number of inter - molecular bonds , and consequently stiffer nanostructures @xcite . however , there are strong evidences that functionalization with boron or nitrogen atoms is favorable in the c(1 ) sites @xcite .",
    "chemical functionalization , by replacing the c(1)-h groups with nitrogen and/or boron atoms , leads to interesting molecules to be used as mbbs : tetra - aza - adamantane ( n@xmath4c@xmath5h@xmath6 ) , tetra - bora - adamantane ( b@xmath4c@xmath5h@xmath6 ) , and di - aza - di - bora - adamantane ( b@xmath7n@xmath8c@xmath5h@xmath6 ) , which are labeled here ta , tb and dadb , respectively , and are schematically represented in figure [ fig1]b .",
    "those molecules are very stable , providing four chemically active sites , still preserving the strong intra - molecular bonding of the original adamantane molecule @xcite .",
    "considering those molecules as mbbs , self - assembly could take place by using , as the driving force , the dipolar interaction between the boron site in one molecule and the nitrogen site in the neighboring one .    in order to explore the potentialities of crystal engineering using functionalized adamantane",
    ", we devised a number of molecular crystals that could be grown by self - assembly .",
    "we should emphasize that although we are here using the term molecular crystal , the inter - molecular interactions in those crystals are controlled by covalent bonding @xcite , instead of the weak dispersive attractive interactions usually observed in typical molecular crystals .",
    "the functionalized adamantane molecules , with four chemically active sites , have a tetrahedral symmetry , which favors crystalline organization in zincblende ( zb ) or wurtzite ( wz ) structures .",
    "the tetrahedral symmetry of such arrangement is indicated in figure [ fig1]c , evidencing that inter - molecular bonding is controlled by the b - n interactions .",
    "for example , the crystal formed by a basis of ta and tb molecules in a zb configuration , labeled here as zb - ta+tb , a ta molecule sits in the lattice origin ( 0,0,0 ) and a tb one sits in the ( 1/4,1/4,1/4)@xmath9 position , where @xmath9 is the crystalline lattice parameter .",
    "this crystal could be equivalently formed by a basis consisting of two dadb molecules , appropriately arranged to provide only b - n inter - molecular bonds . in this last case , due to the equivalence of the two molecules in the basis",
    ", we labeled as diamond-2dadb .",
    "crystalline structures with the same molecules discussed in the previous paragraph , but arranged in a wz configuration , are labeled wz - ta+tb and wz-2dadb .",
    "however , the wz structure contains four molecules in the crystalline basis , in contrast to only two in zb structure .",
    "this wz structure could be described by a hexagonal structure plus a basis of four molecules .",
    "for example , the wz - ta+tb is formed by two ta molecules sitting in ( 0,0,0 ) and ( @xmath9/3,2@xmath9/3,@xmath10/2 ) positions and two tb molecules sitting in ( 0,0,@xmath11 ) and ( @xmath9/3,2@xmath9/3,@xmath11+@xmath10/2 ) positions , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are lattice parameters and @xmath12 is an internal parameter .",
    "although the ta+tb and 2dadb crystals , in both crystalline configurations , are isomeric , they carry important differences in terms of self - assembly . the ta+tb crystals could be grown layer by layer , with sub - nanometric precision , by introducing the crystal seed alternately in solutions rich in tetra - aza- and tetra - bora - adamantane molecules . in this case",
    ", the driving force for self - assembly comes from attractive coulomb interactions between the different molecules in solution .",
    "an equivalent procedure to build 2dadb crystals would be considerably more difficult using solutions rich in di - aza - di - bora - adamantane molecules , since all molecules are in the same charge state , and the driving force should be controlled by the weak attractive multipole interactions .",
    "the stability of the molecular crystals can be quantified by the cohesive ( or lattice ) energy , the energy gain between a configuration in which the molecules are infinitely separated and one in a crystalline phase .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] presents the total energy variation as a function of the crystalline volume for the zb- and wz-2dadb . as discussed in the previous paragraphs , the molecular crystal in a zb configuration contains two functionalized molecules ( one ta plus one tb molecule ) while the wz one contains four molecules ( two ta plus two tb molecules ) , and therefore the total energy is presented per pair of functionalized molecules , in order to allow a proper comparison of energies between the zb and wz crystals .",
    "the results indicated strong cohesion for both crystalline structures , although with a small favoring for the zb configuration over the wz one .",
    "table [ tab1 ] summarizes the properties of crystals with different compositions , indicating favoring of the zb structure for all those crystals .",
    "it has been recently shown that cohesion , in molecular crystals made of functionalized adamantane with boron and nitrogen atoms , is essentially controlled by the strong inter - molecular b - n bonding , and intra - molecular bonds are only slightly affected by the presence of the neighboring functionalized molecules @xcite .",
    "therefore , cohesive energy should be essentially associated with the binding energy of the inter - molecular b - n bonds . for the diamond-2dadb crystal ,",
    "cohesive energy per inter - molecular b - n bond is 1.85 ev , which is considerably smaller than the one for a b - n bond in hexagonal boron nitride solids of @xmath13 6.9 ev , computed using the same theoretical framework .",
    "however , this value is large enough to guarantee stability for the molecular crystal .",
    "additionally , those crystals present large bulk moduli , in the 20 - 42 gpa range , when compared to values of around 10 gpa for typical organic molecular crystals @xcite .",
    "the 2dadb crystals provide larger cohesive energies and bulk moduli than the ta+tb ones .",
    "the stiffer 2dadb crystals resulted from the smaller b - n inter - molecular bonds ( 1.725 - 1.752  ) when compared to the respective ones ( 1.907 - 1.983  ) in the ta+tb crystals .",
    "the inter - molecular b - n bonds have a dative covalent character in all crystals , such that the b - n bonds are essentially formed by the electrons coming from the non - bonding 2p orbitals ( lone pair ) in nitrogen functionalized adamantane .",
    "this covalent behavior was already observed in the interaction between two functionalized diamantane molecules ( one with nitrogen and the other with boron ) , as discussed in ref .",
    "this strong inter - molecular bonding contrasts with bonding in typical molecular crystals , such as crystals made of pristine adamantane @xcite , in which bonding is controlled by the weak dispersive attractive potentials .",
    "we also explored the possibility of building molecular crystals using the radical tetra - adamantyl ( rta ) as a mbb .",
    "this molecule is formed by removing the four hydrogen atoms bonded to c(1 ) atoms in adamantane ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) .",
    "although this is only a hypothetical molecular configuration , our calculations indicated that it is mechanically stable and maintains the cage - like structure of the original adamantane molecule .",
    "table [ tab1 ] presents the properties of crystals made of tetra - adamantyl molecules , called zb- or wz-2rta , indicating large cohesive energies and bulk moduli .",
    "the inter - molecular c - c bonds ( 1.608 - 1.632  ) in both configurations are only a little longer than the respective ones in diamond ( 1.54  ) .",
    "the binding energy per inter - molecular bond is around 6 ev , which is very close to the cohesive energy per c - c bond in diamond ( 7.5 ev ) .",
    "this indicates that the inter - molecular bonds diamond-2rta and wz-2rta are essentially covalent and equivalent to bonds in diamond .",
    "our results have so far shown that crystals , made of functionalized adamantane , have appropriate mechanical properties for several applications in nems . in order to evaluate other potentialities , we explored their electronic and dielectric properties .",
    "all molecular crystals investigated here have wide and direct bandgaps ( between 3.8 and 4.2 ev ) , as shown in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "these results suggest potential applications for opto - electronic devices in the ultraviolet region .",
    "those values are about 1 ev lower than the bandgaps computed for molecular crystals made of pristine adamantane ( 5.1 ev ) using the same methodology .",
    "these results are fully consistent with recent experimental data , which found an 1 ev reduction in the principal gap of adamantane as result of nitrogen functionalization ( to form tetra - aza - adamantane molecules ) @xcite .",
    "as it has been recently pointed out , the nitrogen atoms incorporated in the c(1 ) sites of adamantane introduce 2p nitrogen - related energy levels in the top of valence band of adamantane , reducing the principal gap by 1.3 ev @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the electronic band structure of the diamond-2dadb and diamond-2rta crystals .",
    "the band structure of the zb - ta+tb crystal @xcite is similar to that of the diamond-2dadb one , in terms of dispersion , effective masses and gaps . in the diamond-2dadb crystal",
    ", the top of the valence band presents a small dispersion , while the bottom of the conduction band presents a considerably larger dispersion , which is totally similar to the band structure of pure adamantane crystal @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the diamond-2rta crystal presents large dispersion in both band limits , evidencing the strong covalent bonding controlling inter - molecular interactions .",
    "the effective masses for electrons in the conduction band and holes in the valence bands are presented in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the results indicate that effective masses for holes ( @xmath14 ) are larger than masses for electrons ( @xmath15 ) for all crystals , indicating favoring for electron transport over hole one .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the real and imaginary dielectric functions ( @xmath16 ) for the diamond-2dadb molecular crystal as a function of the photon energy .",
    "those functions are similar in all the other molecular crystals investigated here ( ta+tb and 2rta ) .",
    "the dielectric constant ( @xmath0 ) , computed as the photon zero - energy limit of @xmath17 , is in the 2.8 - 3.0 range for all molecular crystals , which is in the same range of that constant for a molecular crystal made of pristine adamantane ( 2.7 ) in a tetragonal configuration , computed using the same methodology .",
    "those values are fully consistent with other calculations on molecular crystals made of pristine diamondoids ( in the 2.46 - 2.68 range ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , these molecular crystals could be classified as low-@xmath0 materials , in the context of electronic circuits that consider the dielectric constant of silicon oxide ( @xmath18 ) as a reference value .",
    "these results suggest potential applications as dielectric materials to work as space filling between nanodevice interconnects to minimize parasitic capacitances .",
    "in summary , we have shown that adamantane molecules , either chemically functionalized or in the radical form , are potential candidates to work as molecular building blocks for nanostructure self - assembly .",
    "the crystals formed by those molecules , in zincblende and wurtzite configurations , presented favorable mechanical properties , such as large bulk moduli as large as 70 gpa , which make them very stable at room temperatures or even higher .",
    "all those molecular crystals presented wide and direct electronic bandgaps in the 3.8 to 4.2 ev range , indicating potential applications in opto - electronics in the ultraviolet region .",
    "however , those theoretical gap values should be considered as lower limits , since they are generally underestimated , when compared to experimental data , by at least 1 ev using the theoretical framework of the density functional theory @xcite .",
    "those molecular crystals could be used as low-@xmath0 dielectrics between interconnects in nanodevices , with dielectric constants in the 2.8 - 3.0 range . in the search for low-@xmath0 dielectrics ,",
    "scientists have already found materials in which that constant could be as low as 2.0 , such as porous silicon and silicon oxide materials .",
    "porous materials tend to be very brittle , and therefore unsuitable for large scale integration in device technologies . on the other hand",
    ", the molecular crystals presented several advantages over those low-@xmath0 dielectric materials , since they provide simultaneously large bulk moduli , which guarantees mechanical stability .",
