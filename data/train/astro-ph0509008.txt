    "interstellar shock waves play an integral part in the chemical and physical evolution of the interstellar medium .",
    "they are driven by cloud - cloud collisions , stellar winds and supernova explosions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "they cause large increases in the local pressure leading to both compression and heating of the gas . as a result ,",
    "the local increase in density leads to an increase in the rates at which chemical reactions can occur .",
    "c - type shocks may be associated with strong infrared emission lines @xcite , and shock models have been used to explain lines in the k - l region of orion @xcite .",
    "c - type shocks may also be responsible for the absorbtion lines along lines of sight , in particular of ch+ , in diffuse clouds @xcite .",
    "the nature and structure of shock waves travelling through molecular clouds are strongly dependent upon the strength of the ambient magnetic field @xmath5 as well as the local ionization fraction .",
    "when the magnetic field strength is large and fractional ionization low , a multifluid magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) description of the fluid is usually required @xcite . in the multifluid treatment , there are two speeds at which compressive disturbances may propagate . in the charged component of the medium",
    ", disturbances can propagate at the fast magnetosonic speed which is dependent upon both the magnitude @xmath6 and the orientation of @xmath5 with the local shock normal . in the neutral fluid ,",
    "compressive disturbances propagate at the neutral sound speed .    the charged fluids gain energy and momentum from the magnetic field @xmath7 , and",
    "are coupled to the neutral fluid via collisions , transferring energy and momentum , acting to weakly couple the neutrals to @xmath7 .",
    "if the fractional ionization rate is small enough , leading to a low neutral - ion collision rate , the two fluids can be thought of as separate and interpenetrating fluids @xcite .",
    "the ions and electrons contribute only small amounts of mass and pressure , however the magnetic fields are strong enough to influence the shock dynamics .",
    "if the shock speed is less then the ( fast ) magnetosonic speeds of the charged fluids , the charged species are accelerated ahead of the neutrals , via ambipolar diffusion in a magnetic precursor @xcite .",
    "if the neutral temperature remains low enough inside the shock and the neutral flow is everywhere supersonic , the shock is c - type and all the hydrodynamic variables remain continuous .    at low enough densities ,",
    "a three fluid system is adequate with the inclusion of neutrals , ions and electrons .",
    "the grains may be ignored since their contribution to the energy and momentum of the neutrals is negligible . for densities @xmath8 the energy and momentum transferred from the charged dust grains to the neutrals",
    "can no longer be neglected ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and in regions of high density , @xmath9 , and the grains dominate the collisional heating of the neutrals .",
    "the grain abundances in the interstellar medium obey a size distribution ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and for large grain sizes the friction between the grains and neutrals can become great enough that the grains are decoupled from @xmath7 . in the opposite limit , smaller grains may remain tied to @xmath7 .",
    "dust grains also have the potential to drift with respect to the neutral fluid and move out of the shock plane , since grain - neutral collisions can cause their partial decoupling from @xmath7 leading to non - coplanar shock structures .",
    "for perpendicular shocks with @xmath5 oriented perpendicular to the local shock normal * n * , changes in @xmath7 and the dynamic variables inside the shock are restricted to the shock plane containing @xmath5 and * n * ( e.g. , @xcite ) . when @xmath5 is oriented obliquely with the shock normal , there is a current parallel to the @xmath7 component transverse to the shock propagation direction .",
    "@xmath10 , the @xmath7 component perpendicular to * n * , can rotate out of the shock plane inside the shock before returning to the shock plane downstream .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that by changing only the transverse component of @xmath7 , very different hydrodynamic shock structures are found .",
    "@xcite investigated the rotation of @xmath7 in fast steady shock structures with the inclusion of one grain species .",
    "this involved integration of the shock fluid conservation equations from upstream to downstream which proved difficult for shock speeds @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite concluded that steady fast shock solutions do not exist for these conditions .",
    "@xcite showed that these solutions were in fact intermediate , not fast , solutions which do not exist for shock speeds above a critical value .",
    "@xcite presented magnetic field ( @xmath12 versus @xmath13 ) phase space topologies , demonstrating that the shock solution belongs to a one - parameter family .",
    "integration from upstream becomes complicated since the phase space trajectories can diverge due to finite numerical precision , and end up on neighbouring intermediate solutions which can become unphysical .",
    "integrating from the downstream state ensures that the correct fast solution trajectory is followed .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the non - coplanar nature of c - type shocks with the inclusion of a grain size distribution .",
    "the shock is assumed steady state since the time scales over which the fluid variables vary are longer then the time required to transverse the shock . the methodology of @xcite is extended to include a grain size distribution and the integration of the energy equation allows for radiative cooling .",
    "the shock problem comprises of three ordinary differential equations ( odes ) in @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and pressure @xmath14 , along with algebraic expressions for the neutral velocity components , electric field components , and charged species properties .",
    "it is a two point boundary problem connecting the upstream and downstream states , and integration proceeds from downstream to upstream to ensure the fast shock solution . with radiative cooling the fluids",
    "do not cool to their final temperature until far downstream of the shock front , and integration over such long time scales is infeasible ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a shooting integration method is implemented which searches for an initial state inside the cooling zone which , after integration towards upstream , yields the pre - shock state .",
    "conditions inside molecular clouds are assumed , @xmath15 , with shock speed @xmath16 .",

    "the treatment of the charged species are addressed in section [ chargedspeciessection ] , along with the derivation for both the electron and grain hall parameters and the electric field component @xmath17 , in sections [ sectionhallparameters ] and [ ezsection ] , respectively . the shock calculation and integration methods",

    "there is only the one exception , when grain charging is used ( equation ( [ graincharge ] ) ) the electrons are allowed to stick to the grains , and so electrons are removed from , or injected into , the electron fluid to conserve charge density ( equation ( [ electronnumberdensity ] ) ) .",

    "the grain model details , i.e. , modelling the grain population as either a separate grain species or else as a continuous grain size distribution , is important to the overall shock structure , as well as the dynamics of the individual grain species / size classes .    the grain models considered here were chosen to illustrate the main qualitative changes in the resulting shocks .",
    "the shock profiles were clearly altered with the introduction of a grain size distribution as opposed to the single sized grain models .",
    "the net charge on the grains is increased for the mrn models with the grains becoming better coupled to the magnetic field , resulting in less magnetic field rotation inside the shock front .",
    "the mrn(mantles ) and mrn(pah ) models were chosen to illustrate changes in the shock profiles when departing from the standard mrn model .",
    "it should be noted that the mrn(mantles ) model is not purely a mrn model with growth of ice mantles of constant thickness . we have followed the model of @xcite who increase the size of the grains by a factor of @xmath455 .",
    "the qualitative changes are clear though ; any increase in the grain sizes leading to larger grain surface areas ( larger grain charge ) will cause an increase in the net charge on the grains , and the grain coupling to @xmath7 .",
    "however , by increasing the collisional cross section , the grains are increasingly coupled to the neutrals via collisions . in the mrn(mantles ) models shown in section [ mrnmantles ] , the latter effect was dominant with the mrn(mantles ) solution showing more magnetic field rotation than it mrn counterpart .    as @xmath7 is compressed inside the shock ,",
    "the charged species are accelerated with respect to the neutrals , however , this is opposed by the collisional drag of the neutrals .",
    "if the grains are highly coupled to @xmath7 ( high @xmath335 ) and the movements of the neutrals and other highly coupled species ( i.e. , ions , pahs , and electrons ) are mainly restricted to the @xmath33 plane , then @xmath13 is small .",
    "if however , the grains are only partially coupled to @xmath7 , either because they are large in size and so are better coupled to the neutral fluid via collisions and/or have low charge @xmath332 ( and low @xmath335 ) , then the grains drift out of the @xmath33 plane , and the shock becomes non - coplanar with large @xmath13 .",
    "the grains dominate the collisional heating of the neutrals , with only a small contribution from the ions and a negligible component from the electrons ( due to their low mass ) .",
    "the non - coplanarity in the shock solution depends on the grain model ; the single grain models ( sections [ singlesizedgrainmodel]-[singlesizedgrainmodelmantles ] ) produce significantly more rotation of @xmath10 than for the mrn models ( sections [ mrnsection]-[mrnwithpahsection ] ) . for both @xmath456 and @xmath382 models , the grains were only partially coupled to @xmath7 with @xmath457 inside the shock and the out - of - plane forces are substantial . for the mrn models ,",
    "rotation of @xmath7 is minimal , since the more abundant , smaller @xmath167 classes ( @xmath395 ) which are highly coupled to @xmath7 , dominate the net grain effects on the shock structure .    as @xmath458 the peak in @xmath13 decreases , for a given grain model , and the well @xmath7 coupled charged species",
    "are restricted to the shock plane ( weakly coupled grains are still able to drift out of the shock plane ) .",
    "@xmath10 rotation increases with decreasing @xmath3 and @xmath459 become larger ( on average ) , resulting in more dissipation .",
    "the shock must dissipate the incoming kinetic energy flux over a shorter length scale , and the peak temperature @xmath271 inside low @xmath3 shocks ( for a given grain size model ) are therefore higher than for high @xmath3 shocks . for low @xmath3 shocks , the neutral fluid experiences more compression as it cools and so the sound speed is higher in the final part of the flow .",
    "there is a critical point for low enough @xmath3 , that in the neutral fluid @xmath88 , in which case the derivative @xmath300 is ill - defined ( equation ( [ odepressure ] ) ) and the shock solution is no longer c - type .",
    "below this critical angle @xmath460 the shock solutions may be either j - type or @xmath309-type .",
    "the limiting value of @xmath461 varied with grain model , but the ordering remains same , the higher the peak temperature in the shock , the larger @xmath461 .",
    "grains dominate the collisional heating of the neutrals .",
    "the peak @xmath271 was higher and shock width narrower for the @xmath456 model ( section [ singlesizedgrainmodel ] ) compared with the @xmath382 model ( section [ singlesizedgrainmodelmantles ] ) since the pre - shock abundance of the @xmath462 grains was two orders of magnitude larger , than for the @xmath404 model , which compensated for their smaller collisional cross - sections .",
    "conversely , for the mrn(mantles ) model ( section [ mrnmantles ] ) , the increase in the total frictional heating of the neutrals due to the increase in the net grain collisional cross - sections lead to hotter thinner shocks than for the mrn model with an equivalent pre - shock grain abundance ( section [ mrnsection ] ) . since the temperatures , and subsequently @xmath86 , are higher in the mrn(mantles ) model ( for a given @xmath3 ) , it is more difficult for the neutral fluid to maintain supersonic flow and subsequently @xmath3 is restricted to @xmath463 for the mrn(mantles ) model but only @xmath464 for the mrn model ( for @xmath31 and @xmath465 considered here ) .",
    "there are also critical values of @xmath465 for which c - type solutions do not exist . increasing @xmath465 ( for a given @xmath3 ) ,",
    "increases the neutral - grain collisional heating rates and thus dissipation . with a large enough increase in @xmath271 and @xmath86",
    "the neutral flow can not remain supersonic .",
    "for all grain models considered here , the c - type solutions also broke down for @xmath466 ( independent of @xmath3 ) , with only j - type or c@xmath4type shocks possible .",
    "the exact limits of @xmath3 and @xmath465 could vary with the choice of cooling function .",
    "the @xcite cooling rate has been used here , other treatments of the cooling rate @xcite , will lead to different temperature structures and thus different limits on @xmath3 and @xmath465 .",
    "however the orderings of the different grain models will remain the same ; the cooler mrn and @xmath382 models will have lower @xmath461 than the hotter mrn(mantles ) and @xmath467 models , respectively .    in the mrn models ( sections [ mrnsection]-[mrnmantles ] ) the @xmath158 dependent grain charging , @xmath468 , increased the grain coupling to @xmath7 .",
    "the smaller @xmath167 classes @xmath395 were compressed with the ion fluid and @xmath7 .",
    "mid range grains remained coupled to @xmath7 until reductions in @xmath82 lead to their decoupling from @xmath7 , and were compressed with the neutral fluid thereafter .",
    "the largest grains @xmath397 are essentially compressed along with the neutral fluid . when pahs are present ( section [ mrnwithpahsection ] ) , @xmath248 is reduced with @xmath435 , and the mid to large grain size classes are less coupled to @xmath7 and are ( on average ) decoupled further by neutral collisions inside the shock . as a result",
    "there is a larger hall current and the amount of rotation of @xmath10 is increased .    here",
    "@xmath158 is given by the approximation in equation ( [ teapprox ] ) based upon fig . 1 of @xcite .",
    "changing the treatment of @xmath158 could largely effect @xmath82 of the larger grains and alter their coupling to @xmath7 as well as @xmath469 . however , smaller grains with low @xmath82 are highly coupled to @xmath7 ( essentially independent of @xmath158 and @xmath82 ) and dominate the grain effects on shock structure . thus variations in the treatment of @xmath158",
    "are unlikely to change the model results .",
    "@xmath332 increases with increasing @xmath158 according to equation ( [ graincharge ] ) , however as @xmath158 decreases , the uncharging proceeds simply via the re - release of the captured electrons .",
    "more realistically the reduction in @xmath332 proceeds via the capture of ions @xcite , and the ion fluid is depleted .",
    "moreover , inside shock waves in dense clouds , negatively charged pahs may be neutralized in neutral - pah@xmath427 reactions , resulting in electron detachment @xcite .",
    "@xcite modelled the charge variations of grains in a planar steady c - type shock with @xmath470 .",
    "the grain population was represented by a small ( dominant ) pah grain component and a large grain component ( given by an mrn distribution @xmath471 ) , and they found that the charge variations for each were very different .",
    "the pahs were neutralised by neutral - pah@xmath427 reactions via electron detachment , while the larger grains became more negatively charged as @xmath158 and thus @xmath332 increased through the shock .",
    "detachment of electrons via neutralization of the pah@xmath427s , may allow for the @xmath472 ( equation ( [ graincharge ] ) ) charging to proceed in the mrn(pah ) model , potentially increasing the grain-@xmath7 coupling , reducing the rotation of @xmath350 .",
    "however , the capture of ions could also counteract any increases in @xmath82 .",
    "the shock model of @xcite , included both electron and ion attachment on the grain surfaces , and the net negative charge on the grain component still increased significantly due to the increase in the attachment rate of electrons with increasing @xmath158 .",
    "thus , it is likely that if ion attachment were included in the models here , @xmath332 should still increase with @xmath158 .",
    "the details of this will need to be quantified and confirmed in further studies .",
    "inertia of the grains has also been neglected and their drift is given by the balance of electromagnetic forces and neutral - grain collisional drag .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that for very small grains ( @xmath473 ) the length scales over which the neutral fluid and magnetic field were compressed , @xmath474 and @xmath475 , respectively , are over three orders of magnitude larger than the length scales for the gas drag to decelerate the grains @xmath476 .",
    "thus , neglecting the inertia of the smaller grains is a good approximation .",
    "however , for the large grains ( @xmath477 ) , @xmath476 is of the same order as @xmath475 and so the inertia can not be neglected . the larger grains dominate the field - neutral coupling and so the inclusion of their inertia may effect the shock structure .",
    "the amount of dissipation inside the shock was relatively insensitive to the orientation of @xmath5 for the pre - shock conditions considered here ; @xmath426 .",
    "the peak @xmath271 inside the shock was essentially unaltered when @xmath478 for the mrn(pah ) model ( section [ sectionbysuppressed ] ) even though the mrn(pah ) model had the most @xmath10 rotation .",
    "similar comparisons have been made for the other mrn models .",
    "the critical angle @xmath461 for which the neutral flow inside the shock makes the transition from supersonic to subsonic is also unaltered when @xmath13 is suppressed . for the purposes of calculating detailed chemical models and molecular line emission",
    "the shock problem can be greatly simplified by suppressing @xmath13 .",
    "this may not be the case , however , for higher @xmath465 where grains may become further decoupled from @xmath7 .",
    "the choice of grain model affects the shock structure , however , the same overall jump conditions ( for given pre - shock conditions ) are still satisfied , and the same power per unit area is dissipated inside the layer of hot gas inside the shock transition . for the models here ,",
    "the temperatures inside the shock reach @xmath479 and the molecules will remain intact , so the molecular line emission should be similar regardless of the grain model . @xcite",
    "numerically modelled co and h@xmath480 line emission for c - type shocks subject to the wardle instability , concluding that the line strengths are relatively insensitive to the exact details of the shock structure",
    ". however , the choice of grain model does effect the limits @xmath465 and @xmath3 for which the shock becomes j - type ( or c@xmath4 type ) , and the temperatures inside j - type shock reach much higher values , so the shocked molecules may not always remain intact .",
    "new shock models for fast oblique c - type shocks have been presented here with pre - shock conditions @xmath426 , @xmath481 , and @xmath482 for freely specified magnetic field @xmath5 orientation @xmath483",
    ". the grain population is represented by either    * a single grain population of size @xmath456 or @xmath382 , * a continuous ( standard ) mrn grain size distribution , * a mrn distribution with ice mantles , or * a mrn distribution with additional populations of positively and negatively charged pahs .",
    "there were clear differences in the shock profiles with grain model due to the coupling of the grains to either / both the magnetic field and/or neutral fluid .",
    "smaller and/or highly charged grains remain well coupled to @xmath7 whereas larger grains are coupled to the neutral fluid through collisions . shock models with grain populations that are well coupled to @xmath7 result in more co - planar shock profiles with minimal rotation of @xmath7 out of the shock plane .",
    "the results are summarized below :    * for a given @xmath3 , the smaller @xmath456 grain model produces more co - planar solutions than the @xmath382 model since the @xmath456 grains are better coupled to @xmath7 . *",
    "each grain size class in the mrn models were differentially accelerated inside the shock front , with the largest grains being compressed along with the neutrals and the smaller grains compressed along with the ions and @xmath7 . *",

    "the effect of charging grains via the capture of the electrons increased the grain-@xmath7 coupling in all grain models . * the increase in the grain surface areas from the mrn to the mrn(mantles ) models increased the net grain charge , however the increase in the grain collisional cross sections resulted in better coupling of the grains to the neutrals and consequently more rotation of @xmath7 out of the shock plane , for a given @xmath3 . * the grains dominate the drag force and collisional heating of the neutrals , so the models with larger ( larger collisional cross sections ) or more abundant grains have higher peak temperatures and the shock fronts are subsequently narrower i.e. , the collisional heating for the less abundant @xmath382 grains lead to lower peak shock temperatures and wider shock fronts than for the more abundant @xmath456 grains .",
    "conversely , the larger mrn(mantles ) model lead to increased peak temperatures , and narrower shock fronts , compared with the mrn model , due to the increase in the collisional cross section of the grains . *",
