    "in many - body systems described by classical mechanics the presence of an ordered phase is connected to the spontaneous breaking of symmetries associated with local order parameters .",
    "a system consisting of classical spins , for instance , may admit a ground state having all spins oriented along a given direction .",
    "such ground states simultaneously break the spin - rotation and the time - reversal symmetry witnessed by a non - vanishing magnetic moment .    considering quantum systems , in contrast ,",
    "one finds also different phases connected to some physical quantity but not necessarily to the magnetic moment .",
    "the paradigmatic example is a translation invariant spin-@xmath3 chain for which the ground states correspond to the so called valence bond states , i.e. states build up by tensor products of maximally entangled bipartite states  @xcite . in such systems neither the spin - rotation nor the time - reversal symmetry is broken , nevertheless , it is possible to define order parameters characterizing the phases . typically nematic phases occur if at least one symmetry of the hamiltonian is broken which are phases with long range ordering , i.e. defined by order parameters on a finite set of sides .",
    "other examples intensively discussed are topological order phases  @xcite that , for instance , are associated with the robustness of ground state degeneracies  @xcite , are quantized non - abelian geometric phases  @xcite or possess patterns due to long - range quantum entanglement  @xcite .",
    "frustration occurs for systems with competing interactions or non - trivial geometries and can be related to quantum entanglement  @xcite .",
    "non - trivial spin orders are usually found if an interplay between frustration and quantum fluctuations is at work resulting in chiral , nematic or general multipolar phases .",
    "in contrast to topological phases , even in the case of a vanishing magnetic moment the spin - rotation symmetry is broken  @xcite .",
    "these phases are also interesting from the point of applications .",
    "the topological ordered phases play a fundamental role in the spin liquids  @xcite and in non - abelian fractional hall systems  @xcite and are predicted to play a key role in the future development of fault - tolerant quantum computers  @xcite .",
    "the nematic order is usually found in materials commercially used in the liquid crystal technology  @xcite such as lcds ( liquid crystal display ) .",
    "non - trivial ordered spins appear usually for higher dimensional systems ( lattices ) or sites with more than two degrees of freedom ( spins higher than @xmath3 ) .",
    "exceptions are the frustrated one dimensional ferromagnetic spin-@xmath3 chain in an external magnetic field having a nematic ordered phase  @xcite and the one dimensional cluster - ising model exhibiting a symmetry protected topological ordered phase  @xcite .",
    "in general , mathematical tools to handle such systems are rare and only few very specific hamiltonians have been found to be analytically solvable .",
    "the present paper introduces a huge class of analytically solvable one dimensional models with two degrees of freedoms ( spin-@xmath3 ) exhibiting both topologically and nematic ordered phases , which we dub @xmath1-cluster - ising models .",
    "the index @xmath4 refers to the presence of an @xmath0-body interaction , a cluster size of @xmath0 .",
    "the physical systems under investigation are characterized by two competing interactions , a two - body ising interaction along the @xmath5-axis and an @xmath0-body interaction along the @xmath6-axis and the @xmath7-axis .",
    "the hamiltonian of the family of models can be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 has the dimension of an energy ( which we set equal to one in the computation ) and @xmath10 stands for @xmath11 via the parameter @xmath12 the relative weight of the two interactions is controlled : when @xmath12 approaches @xmath13 the system is dominated by the multi - body interaction whereas when @xmath12 tends to @xmath14 the system is dominated by the ( anti - ferromagnetic ) ising interaction .",

    "this corresponds to the case when both interactions have equal weights .",
    "this critical point @xmath16 , surprisingly , does not depend on the @xmath0-body interaction , hence , it does not dependon the cluster size . in strong contrast to the relevant ordering in the cluster phase that depends strongly on @xmath1 : in case of odd @xmath1 a symmetry protected topologically ordered phase is present , whereas for even @xmath1 a nematic phase is present . in both cases",

    "we can exactly evaluate a measure for genuine multipartite entanglement  @xcite , i.e. quantify the entanglement content .",
    "so far , long range multipartite entanglement close to a phase transition has been studied in terms of entanglement witnesses , e.g. for the @xmath21 spin chain  @xcite or for the @xmath22 model  @xcite . having this strong tool at hand , a measure of genuine multipartite entanglement",

    "the block entanglement properties are studied with focus around the quantum phase transition . via the relation between conformal field theory  @xcite and the divergence of the block entanglement at the quantum phase transition we are able to evaluate the central charges of the models that turns out to depend on @xmath1 .",
    "last but not least we conclude ( sec .  [ conclusions ] ) by discussing the interplay between the characterization of the many - body systems by ordered parameters and by symmetries in the hilbert - schmidt space of the ground states revealing the entanglement properties .",

    "<S> we prove that the cluster phase corresponds to a nematic ordered phase and in the case of odd @xmath1 to a symmetry protected topological ordered phase . </S>",
    "<S> though complex , we are able to quantify the multi - particle entanglement content of neighboring spins . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that there exists no bipartite or , in more detail , no @xmath2-partite entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> this is possible since the non - trivial symmetries of the hamiltonian restrict the state space . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , only if the ising interaction is strong enough ( local ) genuine @xmath0-partite entanglement is built up . due to their analytically solvableness the @xmath1-cluster - ising models serve as a prototype for studying non trivial - spin orderings and due to their peculiar entanglement properties they serve as a potential reference system for the performance of quantum information tasks . </S>"
