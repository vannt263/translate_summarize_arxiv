    "the ceramic compound magnesium diboride , mgb@xmath0 , has the highest superconducting critical temperature t@xmath1 = 39 k ever reported for a binary system .",
    "the structure is graphite - like , i.e. , it consists of honeycomb layers of b separated by triangular metal planes .",
    "its discovery @xcite has triggered a tremendous activity to investigate the electronic @xcite and phononic @xcite properties as well as the electron ",
    "phonon coupling @xcite for mgb@xmath0 and for related binary and ternary borides .",
    "the main electronic characteristics are :    * the states at the fermi level e@xmath2 are dominantly derived from boron @xmath3 orbitals .",
    "the b @xmath4 @xmath5-bands are responsible for the strong covalent bonding in the b layers and have mainly 2d character , i.e. , only very little @xmath6 dispersion , whereas the b @xmath7 @xmath8-bands have 3d character .",
    "* electrons are transferred from the mg orbitals to the b orbitals . as a result",
    ", there is a partial ionic character , but these electrons are not well localized at the b sites , they are rather distributed over the whole crystal . *",
    "the mg atoms are responsible for a downward shift of the b @xmath8-bands relative to the @xmath5-bands , as compared to the corresponding c bands in graphite . as a result , there is a partial occupation of the @xmath8-bands and a hole doping of the @xmath5-bands .",
    "coupling of the @xmath5-holes to the intralayer b bond - stretching phonon modes dominates the electron -phonon coupling and is responsible for the high t@xmath1 @xcite . *",
    "the compound is hold together by dominant intralayer b - b covalent bonds , dominant interlayer metallic bonds and by a substantial ionic character .",
    "there are indications for an additional interlayer b - mg contribution to the bonding , e.g. , the slight increase in the @xmath6 dispersion of the b @xmath5-bands as compared to a hypothetical structure where the mg atoms are removed .",
    "when going from mgb@xmath0 to alb@xmath0 , the valence charge - difference plots show a stronger directional m - b bond @xcite ( m = metal atom ) , and our own calculations show a slightly stronger @xmath6 dispersion of the @xmath5-bands .",
    "it is the objective of the present paper to analyse and compare the covalent bonding properties of mgb@xmath0 and alb@xmath0 quantitatively within a variant of our recently developed energy - partitioning scheme @xcite .",
    "a first attempt in this direction was made by ravindran _",
    "_ @xcite by means of the crystal - orbital - hamilton population @xcite ( cohp ) .",
    "it will be shown below , however , that for the use of non - orthogonal basis functions the cohp do not have a well - defined physical meaning and can not be used to compare quantitatively the covalent bonding properties between various structures .",
    "starting point of the discussion is the expression for the total energy e@xmath9 from the density functional theory in local density approximation , @xmath10 with the occupation numbers @xmath11 and the eigenvalues @xmath12 of the kohn - sham single - particle wave functions @xmath13 , the electron density @xmath14 , the effective potential @xmath15 , the hartree energy @xmath16 , the exchange - correlation energy @xmath17 , the potential @xmath18 of the nuclei ( or of the ionic cores in the case of a pseudopotential calculation ) and the interaction energy @xmath19 between the nuclei ( or between the ionic cores ) .",
    "the hope is that the trends for the total energies are already well described by the first term ( band - structure energy @xmath20 ) when comparing various systems .",
    "this assumption is made implicitly in the common practice to discuss the energetics via the electronic density of states .",
    "an energy - partitioning scheme is a tool to analyse @xmath20 further .    for systems with covalent bonding the crystal wavefunctions @xmath13",
    "are best represented by a minimal set of well - localized orbitals @xmath21 ( with character @xmath22 described by the angular and magnetic atom quantum numbers @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) attached to the various atoms @xmath25 ( tight - binding representation ) , @xmath26 the band - structure energy is calculated by inserting ( [ tbrep ] ) into @xmath27 with the kohn - sham hamiltonian @xmath28 .",
    "the remaining terms on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ etotdft ] ) which we abbreviated by @xmath29 in refs . are calculated by approximating @xmath14 by a superposition of atomic charge densities , yielding @xcite @xmath30 here @xmath31 is a pair potential term , @xmath32 a many - body potential term which is small for nearly charge neutral systems , @xmath33 denotes the total energy of the free atoms before being condensed to the crystal , and the @xmath34 are the occupation numbers for the energy levels @xmath35 .",
    "we now add to and subtract from @xmath36 the terms @xmath37 h_{i\\alpha i\\alpha}^{\\rm free\\ ; atom}\\ ] ] and @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 denote the elements of the overlap and hamiltonian matrix .    rearranging the terms in an appropriate manner yields the cohesive energy @xmath41 the first term is the promotion energy @xmath42 with mulliken s gross charge @xcite @xmath43    this term describes the cost in energy when starting the condensation process from free atoms and then redistributing the electrons among the various orbitals from the occupation numbers @xmath34 to the occupation number @xmath44 found in the crystal and characterized by @xmath44@xcite .",
    "the second term is the crystal - field term @xmath45 which describes the change in energy due to a shift of the on - site energies when the atoms are condensed to form the crystal so that the potential acting on an electron at atom @xmath25 is not just the atomic potential of this atom but the environment - dependent crystal potential .",
    "the polarization energy @xmath46\\ ] ] describes the change in energy due to the hybridization of orbitals localized at one atom when the atom is embedded in the crystal .",
    "finally , the covalent bond energy @xmath47 is the change in energy arising from the hybridization of orbitals localized at different atoms , @xmath48 with @xmath49   \\\\ \\overline{\\varepsilon_{j\\beta i\\alpha } } & = & \\frac{1}{2 } \\left ( h_{i\\alpha i\\alpha } + h_{j\\beta j\\beta } \\right ) \\qquad . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath50 can be subdivided further into energy - resolved contributions , @xmath51 \\qquad .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath52 is negative ( positive ) for bonding ( antibonding ) states . the respective quantity integrated up to a certain energy @xmath53",
    "will be referred to as @xmath54    the energy - partitioning scheme discussed above has the following very attractive property : in a band - structure calculation which deals with an infinitely extended periodic system the average effective potential does not have a physical meaning , and it is therefore set to an arbitrary value which is the same for different crystal structures . in order to be physically meaningful the total energy @xmath36 and the considered terms of an energy - partitioning scheme for a band - structure calculation",
    "therefore must be invariant against a constant shift of the effective potential of the band - structure calculation .",
    "this is fulfilled for @xmath36 ( and hence also for @xmath55 ) which becomes obvious from eq.([etotdft ] ) : shifting @xmath56 by @xmath57 yields opposite shifts for the first two terms which therefore compensate each other ( the remaining terms can be calculated without ambiguity , see for instance , ref . .",
    "furthermore the terms @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath47 of eq .",
    "( [ sumofall ] ) as well as their atom- and orbital - resolved contributions ( and in addition the respective energy - resolved contributions to @xmath47 ) are all invariant . for instance , if the potential is shifted by a constant @xmath57 , then the matrix elements @xmath40 are transformed into @xmath60 and @xmath61 , @xmath62 into @xmath63 , @xmath64 because @xmath65 , so that @xmath57 drops out of the covalent bond energy . because @xmath55 is also invariant , this must hold for the sum of the terms @xmath66 , too . however , we can not calculate separately , for instance , the crystal - field term @xmath67 in a band - structure calculation , because the matrix element @xmath61 is shifted by the shift of the effective potential of the crystal whereas @xmath68 is not ( because for the calculation of the latter quantity the effective potential is always normalized to zero for distances far from the atom ) .",
    "it is therefore physically meaningful only to discuss the terms @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath47 and @xmath69 .",
    "the covalent bond energy thereby is the only term which involves matrix elements for orbitals on different atoms , and therefore it clearly represents the contribution of the interatomic bonding to the band - structure energy . in the following we will confine ourselves to the discussion of this term .",
    "it should be noted that in our former version of the energy - partitioning scheme @xcite the various terms have been arranged in a slightly different manner , arriving @xcite at the equivalent expression @xmath70 with @xmath71 i.e. , @xmath35 of @xmath58 has been replaced by @xmath61 , @xmath72 i.e. , the @xmath44 of @xmath67 have been replaced by @xmath34 , and @xmath73 i.e. , the on - site contributions @xmath74 have not been excluded from the covalent bond energy . when comparing the definitions @xmath58 , @xmath67 , with the definitions @xmath75 , @xmath76 , it becomes obvious that they correspond to a different succession of processes in a gedanken experiment for the condensation of free atoms to the crystal . in the first case",
    "we promote the electrons by redistributing them among the various orbitals of the free atoms and then we bring the free atoms in the crystal positions ( without allowing for a redistribution of the charge densities ) and experience a change in energy described by @xmath67 due to a shift of the on - site energies in the crystal potential . in the second case",
    "we freeze the occupation numbers @xmath34 when bringing the free atoms to the crystal positions and calculate the crystal - field shift @xmath77 for these circumstances , and then we allow for a redistribution of the electrons among the on - site energy levels in the crystal potential .",
    "we think that the first case is closer to the commonly used definitions of the promotion and the crystal - field energy , and we therefore prefer the new variant of the energy partitioning scheme .",
    "finally , we think that it is reasonable to exclude the on - site hybridization contributions @xmath78 from the covalent bond energy because they do not describe interatomic interactions . in the new variant",
    "these terms enter the polarization energy which also has a well - defined physical meaning .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath75 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are also invariant against a constant shift of the effective potential of a band - structure calculation , as well as the atom- , orbital- and energy - resolved contributions of @xmath47 .",
    "again , @xmath76 alone is not invariant and can not be calculated separately in a band - structure calculation .    in former papers",
    "the crystal - orbital - hamilton population @xcite , @xmath81 has been used to characterize the bonding properties .",
    "if orthonormal basis functions are used , this quantity is identical to @xmath82 .",
    "however , in the chemical analysis very often non - orthogonal basis sets are used .",
    "then @xmath83 is not invariant against a constant shift of the effective potential and therefore does not have a well - defined physical meaning in the context of a band - structure calculation .    for systems with metallic bonding the @xmath13",
    "are better represented by a set of plane waves rather than by atom - localized functions .",
    "alternatively , the @xmath13 again can be represented by a set of atom - localized functions also in this case , but then often orbitals have to be included which are not occupied in the free atom in order to make the basis set more complete .",
    "then formally a covalent bond energy @xmath47 can be calculated even for a nearly - free - electron system . whereas the term metallic conductivity is well defined",
    ", it is indeed a problem to discriminate between metallic and covalent bonding . as a working hypothesis",
    "we define a covalent bonding as a bonding which is dominated by the hybridization of those orbitals on various atoms which are already occupied in the respective free atoms .",
    "note that this does not necessarily mean that the corresponding charge - density difference plot exhibits directionality , e.g. , it can be imagined that the @xmath7-orbitals do not necessarily create a charge density with considerable directionality . because our definition of @xmath47 is a generalization of the covalent bond energy introduced by sutton _",
    "@xcite to the case of non - orthogonal basis sets we keep this historical founded nomenclature `` covalent bond energy '' although this quantity may also contain metallic bonding contributions in the above defined sense .",
    "the calculations were performed with the ab - initio pseudopotential method @xcite . band structure and charge density difference plots were practically identical to those of previous calculations @xcite .",
    "for the energy - partitioning analysis the @xmath13 were projected @xcite onto a set of overlapping atom - localized non - orthogonal orbitals .",
    "for these orbitals we chose @xmath84 @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a normalization constant , @xmath87 is the radial pseudo - atomic wavefunction constructed according to vanderbilt @xcite , @xmath88 denotes a contraction factor and @xmath89 represents a cut - off length .",
    "the parameters @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath89 were selected in such a way that the spillage @xcite was minimized , where the spillage characterizes the loss of the norm of the wavefunctions due to the incompleteness of the pseudo - atomic - orbital projection .",
    "we confined ourselves to a minimal set of s , p and d orbitals for mg and b. the band - structure calculated with the projected wavefunctions was nearly identical to the original band structure from the pseudopotential calculation for energies below and not too far above the fermi level .",
    "table [ table1 ] represents the covalent bond energies for various atom pairs in mgb@xmath0 and alb@xmath0 .",
    "it should be recalled that the covalent bonding properties of the two materials may be compared only by the measure @xmath47 and not by cohp because the latter quantity is not invariant against a constant shift of the potential when nonorthogonal basis functions are used , which is the usual case for a chemical analysis in terms of atom - like functions .",
    "the total covalent bond energy is larger in absolute value for alb@xmath0 than for mgb@xmath0 .",
    "as expected , the b - b intralayer covalent bond energy is largest .",
    "interestingly enough , it is larger in absolute value for the mg compound although the b - b distance is larger .",
    "contrary to the general belief , there is also a considerable covalent bond energy between the layers ( the b - m energy is only a factor of about 2 - 2.5 smaller ) and even in the m layers ( the intralayer m - m energy is a factor of about two smaller than the b - m energy ) .",
    "the b - m covalent bond energy increases when going from m = mg to m = al , and this is consistent with the smaller c / a ratio of the al compound .",
    "the b - m distance is in fact smaller for m = al than for m = mg .",
    "the interlayer b - b ( m - m ) bonds are two orders of magnitude ( one order of magnitude ) smaller than the respective intralayer bonds , i.e. , their contributions to the cohesion between the layers is much smaller than the b - m contribution .",
    "our calculations show that the covalent bond energies between all further - distant atoms are considerably smaller than the nearest - neighbor intralayer bonds and the nearest - neighbor b - m bonds .",
    "this means that a nearest - neighbor bond model suffices to describe the two materials .",
    "this is not at all trivial , because in intermetallic compounds , e.g. , feal , coal and nial the further distant bonds are essential @xcite .    in table",
    "[ table2 ] the covalent bond energies for the most important atom pairs are further analysed by considering the dominant angular - resolved contributions . in all cases ,",
    "the p - p contributions are strongest and the s - s contributions weakest .",
    "it becomes obvious from table [ table2 ] that the @xmath92-orbitals make a non - negligible contribution to the bonding between the b and the m layer .",
    "because the @xmath92-orbitals are not occupied in the respective free atoms we would denote this as a `` metallic contribution '' according to our working hypothesis of section [ energypartscheme ] .",
    "this metallic contribution is stronger for alb@xmath0 than for mgb@xmath0 . nevertheless , the `` covalent contribution '' is dominant also for the bonding between the layers , mediated by the metal atom .",
    "the energy - resolved covalent bond energies for the p - p and s - s contributions of the b - b intra , b - m and m - m intra atom pairs are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] , for mgb@xmath0 and alb@xmath0 .",
    "the benefit of the energy - resolved representation is that we can clearly discriminate between bonding and antibonding states .",
    "the s - s bonds are weakened because both bonding and antibonding states are occupied . without the energy - resolved analysis",
    "we could erroneously assume that the s - s covalent bond energy is low because the corresponding matrix elements are small .",
    "for the other orbital pairs of table [ table2 ] dominantly bonding states are occupied , but there are slight differences between mgb@xmath0 and alb@xmath0 .",
    "for instance , the stronger b - b intra bond energy of mgb@xmath0 ( table [ table1 ] ) results mainly from a stronger @xmath93 contribution ( table [ table2 ] ) , and the reason for this is that for the trivalent al part of the antibonding p - p states are occupied ( fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the stronger b - m bond for m = al ( table [ table1 ] ) again results mainly from a stronger @xmath93 contribution , and the reason for this is that the bonding p - p states are more filled for al than for mg .",
    "we have represented a new variant of an energy - partitioning scheme for the density - functional total energy which allows to define a covalent bond energy which is invariant against a constant potential shift .",
    "this property is a precondition for the comparison of the bonding properties in different systems within the framework of band - structure calculations .",
    "the atom- , orbital- and energy resolved contributions to the covalent bond energy have been calculated for mgb@xmath0 and alb@xmath0 .",
    "one central result of the calculations is that a nearest - neighbor bond model is sufficient to describe the bonding properties of these materials .",
    "a working hypothesis has been introduced to discriminate between a covalent and a metallic bonding character .",
    "it has been shown that both in mgb@xmath0 and alb@xmath0 there is a metallic contribution to the bonding between the layers which is stronger for al than for mg .",
    "the benefits of the energy - resolved representation are demonstrated by discussing the differences between the trivalent al and the divalent mg .",
    "the authors are indebted to r. drautz for helpful discussion .                                      in the tight - binding bond model of sutton _",
    "et al . _ , j. phys .",
    "c : solid state phys . * 21 * , 35 ( 1988 ) the promotion energy is defined by using just the on - site charges @xmath94 , but then charge is lost during the process of promotion when nonorthogonal orbitals @xmath95 are used ."
