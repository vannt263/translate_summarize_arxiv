    "radio galaxies are a peculiar set of galaxies which give rise to a number of questions regarding their nature : what kind of effects turn these galaxies into radio galaxies ?",
    "are these effects related to galaxy morphology or galaxy environment ?",
    "what are the relations between the properties of radio galaxies and the normal galaxy population ?",
    "are these properties a result of the radio activity or vice versa ? in the framework of the agn unification scheme ( urry & padovani 1995 ) , radio galaxies are associated with quasars .",
    "therefore the study of such objects plays an important role to constrain physical models of quasar evolution ( kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ) , to further test the unified models , and to explore the origin of radio loudness ( blandford 2000 ) .",
    "+ radio galaxies are usually classified into two morphological classes , edge - darkened fr  is and edge - brightened fr  ii ( fanaroff & riley 1974 ) , and this dichotomy corresponds to a ( continuous ) transition in radio power , which occurs at @xmath6 w hz@xmath7 . in modern high resolution radio maps ,",
    "fr  is are charachterized by bright jets near the radio `` core '' ( centered on the host galaxy nucleus ) , while fr  iis have faint jets ( mostly one - sided as a result of relativistic beaming effects ) coupled with bright hot spots in the lobes , which mark the location where the jet impacts the ism .",
    "optical studies of low - redshift radio galaxies have shown that radio galaxies of both classes are almost invariably associated with giant ellipticals , are generally found in regions of enhanced galaxy density such as clusters or dense groups , and often show signs of interaction ( e.g. zirbel 1997 , gonzalez - serrano et al 1993 ) .",
    "however , some differences between fr  is and fr  ii seem to be present .",
    "the most striking difference is related to the emission line properties of the two classes : while most ( if not all ) fr  is only show weak ( narrow ) emission lines , fr  ii can be distinguished into different sub - classes , according to their spectral properties ( e.g. laing 1994 ) . in particular , the role of a subclass of low excitation fr  ii ( leg ) has still to be fully established : the central engine and the environment of leg appears very similar to that of fr  is ( e.g. chiaberge et al .",
    "2002 , hardcastle & worrall 2000 ) , while the radio power and morphology are typical of fr  ii .    while the above topics are the subject of a number of papers , there are very few detailed studies on the photometric properties of the host galaxies of radio galaxies .",
    "zirbel ( 1996a ) analyzes the surface brightness profiles of the host galaxies of low - redshift powerful radio galaxies .",
    "this work suggests that fr  is exhibit a weak correlation between the size of the host galaxy and the radio power , and also leads to the conclusion that fr  i and fr  ii inhabit a different population of host galaxies .",
    "more specifically , while fr  is are typically associated with cd galaxies , fr  iis are mostly associated with a subclass of elliptical called `` n - galaxies '' . in ground",
    "based images , n - class galaxies appear to have peaked radial brightness profiles , while in hst images it is clear that their peculiar profiles are explained by the presence of a bright quasar - like nucleus surrounded by a faint fuzz .",
    "therfore , when deriving the host galaxy profiles , ground - based images are unreliable if a powerful nuclear source is present .    from an imaging study of a sample of radio - quiet quasars , radio - loud quasars and radio galaxies , dunlop et al .",
    "( 2003 ) conclude that spheroidal hosts become more prevalent with increasing nuclear luminosity . for nuclear luminosities @xmath8 ,",
    "the hosts of both radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars are all massive ellipticals .",
    "they also suggest that the basic properties of these hosts are indistinguishable from those of quiescent , evolved , low - redshift ellipticals of comparable mass .",
    "+ the aim of this paper is to provide valuable infrared photometric data of a sample of 82 3cr radio galaxies and to compare these data with that obtained at other wavelengths for both normal and radio galaxies . to achieve this goal we use both ground - based and high angular resolution hst data to properly disentangle the host galaxy from any other component related to e.g. the agn .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we summarize the sample selection and in section 3 we give details of the observations , image reduction and point spread function determination . in section 4",
    "we present the galaxy luminosity profiles and profile fitting . in section 5",
    "we discuss the results and in section 6 we analize these results from the point of view of a different classification of the galaxies of the sample . in section 7",
    "the black hole mass obtained through two different methods is discussed .",
    "finally , in section 8 we summarize our conclusions .",
    "the sample of galaxies we analyze belongs to the revised third cambridge catalogue ( 3cr ) ( bennet 1962a , 1962b ) .",
    "the 3cr catalog ( spinrad et al . 1985 ) is selected at 178 mhz , it includes the brightest radio sources in the northern sky ( @xmath9 jy ) and contains radio galaxies and quasars out to redshifts of @xmath10 .",
    "since this catalogue is selected based only on the low - frequency radio properties of the sources , it is an excellent database to study the morphology and photometric attributes of the objects without any orientation bias .",
    "we chose all 3cr sources with @xmath0 with the primary goal of characterizing the radio galaxy hosts mostly free from the effects of dust .",
    "there is a total of 116 sources in the 3cr up to a redshift of 0.3 , and we present here the photometric properties of 82 objects . these objects were randomly observed as part of a hst snapshot program 10173 .",
    "only 7 galaxies of the sample were observed as part of other programs .",
    "they are : 3c 84 ( p 7330 ) , 3c 264 ( p 7882 ) , 3c 293 ( p 9726 ) , 3c 305 ( p 7853 ) , 3c 317 ( p 7886 ) , 3c 338 ( p 7453 ) , and 3c 405 ( p 7258 ) . table 1 lists the observed galaxies together with the observation date , right ascension and declination for epoch 2000 , fr class ( fanaroff & riley , 1974 ) and morphological classification .",
    "we used the morphological classification from ned ( nasa / ipac extragalactic database ) and zirbel ( 1996 , paper ii ) .",
    "as can be noted from table 1 many of the host galaxies ( 57% ) still remain morphologically unclassified .",
    "most of the galaxies for which a classification is available in the literature are ellipticals .",
    "thirty four ( 72% ) out of the 47 morphologically classified galaxies are reported as ellipticals , while 7 ( 15% ) objects are classified as early spirals and 6 ( 13% ) as n type galaxies .",
    "we use two different sets of near - infrared data : hst / nicmos and telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ) data .",
    "hst data are essential to derive the radial brightness profile of galaxies located at @xmath11 and particularly for those with a bright nucleus that outshines the host galaxy stellar emission .",
    "tng images are crucial for nearby galaxies ( @xmath12 ) which in general are much larger than the nic-2 field of view and for which a direct measure of the background level is not feasible with the hst data alone . in the following we give a brief description of the datasets and the data analysis procedures .",
    "+      all objects in our sample were observed with nicmos camera 2 ( nic2 ) that has a field of view of @xmath13 and a projected pixel size of @xmath14 .",
    "all images were obtained using the f160w filter ( similar to the standard @xmath15 band ) and have the same total exposure time of 1152 seconds . for only a few exceptions exposure times were shorter .",
    "these are : 3c84 , 3c264 , and 3c317 for which exposure times were 640 , 448 , and 640 seconds respectively . a more detailed technical description of the observations can be found in madrid et al .",
    "( 2006 ) ( hereafter m2006 ) . + we obtained the hst / nicmos data from the multimission archive at the stsci ( mast ) .",
    "the data was processed by standard otfr ( on the fly reprocesing ) calibration pipeline .",
    "we performed two corrections subsequent to the calibration pipeline : the removal of the pedestal effect and the masking of the coronographic spot .",
    "bad columns and bad pixels were masked out too .",
    "the pedestal effect is stochastic noise introduced during the detector readout ( noll et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "each of the quadrants of the detector have a different offset .",
    "one in particular , appears darker when compared to the others .",
    "we remove this effect using the iraf task pedsub , in the space telescope science analysis system ( stsdas ) .",
    "nic2 has a hole to allow coronographic observations , this hole produces a spot on our images and therefore we mask this spot before image combination .",
    "information is recovered using the 4-dither pattern used for the observations .",
    "we combine the four exposures using the pyraf task multidrizzle also in stsdas ( koekemoer & fruchter , 2002 ) .",
    "the final image is the output of multidrizzle , in units of @xmath16 s@xmath7 . during our data reduction",
    "we preserve both the original sky level and the original pixel size of @xmath14 .",
    "+ for the photometric calibration of the reduced data we used the formula of dickinson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to derive a vega - normalized magnitude for f160w ( nic2 ) .",
    "we then have m(f160w ) = -2.5 log [ photfnu @xmath17 cr/@xmath18(vega ) ]  = 22.107 - 2.5 log ( cr ) , where photfnu = @xmath19 jy s dn@xmath7 , and cr is the count rate in dn s@xmath7 . the flux density of vega in the f160w band for nic2 is @xmath18(vega ) = 1043.5 jy .",
    "these magnitude units are different from the st instrumental magnitudes used by m2006 .",
    "we chose the vega system because it is more similar to the standard ground based near - ir system , and for the f160w filter the difference between vega - mag and st - mag corresponds to 3.68 mag . +",
    "a visual inspection of our final images revealed that the amplifier glow effect residuals were not negligible .",
    "the amplifier glow is caused by the readout amplifier situated close to each corner of the detector , and even after the correction was applied we noted that residuals for most cases were around 10% to 20% above the background level .",
    "we trim the border of the images to obtain accurate surface photometry and eliminate the amplifier glow .",
    "the resulting final field of view is @xmath20 .",
    "+      we have used the images taken by marchesini et al .",
    "these images were obtained with the 3.6 m telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ) , the italian national facility located at la palma island ( spain ) .",
    "these observations were made in two runs on jul .",
    "8 - 12 , 2000 and on feb .",
    "9 - 13 , 2001 .",
    "arnica ( arcetri near infrared camera ) was used in the first run and nics ( near infrared camera spectrometer ) was used in the second run .",
    "arnica uses a @xmath21 pixel nicmos 3 array with a pixel size of @xmath22 and a total field of view ( fov ) of @xmath23 which is more than 5 times greater than the fov of the hst nicmos camera 2 . on the other hand ,",
    "nics uses a rockwell @xmath24 hgcdte hawaii array .",
    "nics has two modes available , the small field mode with a pixel size of @xmath25 and a fov of @xmath26 , and the large field mode in which the pixel size and fov are doubled . for both arnica and nics observations",
    "the @xmath27 filter was used .",
    "this filter has a central wavelength of @xmath28 and a @xmath29 of @xmath30 . for nics",
    "the total integration times of 20 min were used , while for arnica total integration times ranged from 5 to 24 min depending on the source .",
    "more detailed information about the individual observations are listed in table 3 of marchesini et al .",
    "+      since suitable fitting of radial profiles at low surface brightness levels is a delicate task , we are extremely cautious in the determination of the background level and its uncertainty .",
    "first of all , most of the galaxies with @xmath31 cover the whole field - of - view of hst / nicmos , therefore the background can not be measured directly .",
    "furthermore , a detailed analysis of the background level for the rest of the galaxies with smaller apparent diameter ( those with @xmath32 ) , shows that the background is not constant .",
    "in fact , background variations among these images can be as large as 40% or more , which makes it impossible to remove it using a common value for all images .",
    "therefore , each image of the @xmath32 galaxies are to be carefully examined in order to determine the proper background level .",
    "however , our analysis shows that , in each image , a constant value across the whole detector s field - of - view is accurate enough to remove the background . for those images where this task was possible ,",
    "background removal left residuals not higher than 5% .",
    "+ for galaxies with @xmath31 the approach is completely different . since we are not able to determine the background on nicmos images given that these galaxies cover the whole chip , we use ground based @xmath33-band images taken with the tng . because of the much larger field of view , these images allow us to easily determine the sky level and also to obtain accurate luminosity profiles in the external regions of the galaxies .",
    "the next step is to simply determine the adequate offset in order to match the luminosity profiles obtained from the hst images with those obtained from the tng .",
    "the matching was done in a intermediate region of the luminosity profiles , avoiding the innermost regions of the tng profiles , where seeing effects are important , and avoiding the outermost region of the hst profiles where background effects are noticeable .",
    "we find that zero points needed to match hst profiles with tng profiles are surprisingly constant over the observation dates and the estimated errors were less that 0.05 @xmath34 @xmath35 .",
    "finally , we assume that the @xmath36 color gradient is null for our galaxies and then we subtract the adequate background level on the hst images in order to match the outermost part of the hst profiles with those obtained from the tng images .",
    "the assumption of null color gradient is supported by the fact that we do not detect any @xmath36 color gradient for the galaxies with @xmath32 , where an accurate background determination on both the tng and the hst images is possible .",
    "further support to this assumption is found in m \" ollenhoff & heidt ( 2001 ) ( hereafter m&h2001 ) .",
    "these authors showed that in a sample of 40 bright spiral galaxies the structural parameters for both the bulge and the disk components are identical for @xmath37 filters , within the error they estimate from the data . + psf modeling for nic2 is well described by suchkov & krist ( 1998 ) and references therein .",
    "psf diffraction structures , such as airy rings and spikes , grow larger with increasing wavelength and therefore one must be very cautious when using infrared images . in our case ,",
    "only a few cases show a bright nuclear source which causes bright psf diffraction patterns on the images . in order",
    "to get rid of these patterns we have used the tiny tim modeling software ( krist , 1993 ) to create suitable psf models for each of the selected images .",
    "these models were then subtracted from the individual images .",
    "this procedure works well in most images , if larger residuals were noticed they were properly masked before any isophote fitting .",
    "besides , during the fitting procedure we also discarded the inner 3 pixels ( @xmath38 ) of the obtained luminosity profiles .",
    "this additional consideration avoids any fitting contamination related to the psf subtraction ( see section 4 ) .",
    "there are numerous methods for extracting luminosity profiles .",
    "the variety includes one - dimensional analysis ( bagget et al .",
    "1988 ) , ellipse fitting to the isophotes of the galaxies ( hraudeau & simien 1996 ) and two - dimensional analysis ( byun & freeman 1995 ) . at first glance",
    "our infrared images show mostly elliptical galaxies with no trace of any further structures , and in a few cases ( 20% ) we can detect dust lanes , jets or plumes .",
    "therefore , we are mostly working with axisymmetric structures which can be easily analized with azimuthal isophote fitting .",
    "for this purpose , we use the ellipse routine within stsdas ( jedrzejewski 1987 ) . before extracting the galaxy profile ,",
    "we carefully mask all spurious objects such as stars , and residual diffraction patterns .    in the case of two galaxies overlapping , once we obtain the luminosity profile and structural parameters ( center coordinates , ellipticity , and position angle of the isophotes ) , we construct a model galaxy using bmodel ( within stsdas ) that is subtracted from the original image .",
    "the resulting image is then used to extract the luminosity profile of the remaining galaxy .",
    "this process is repeated several times until the luminosity profiles of both galaxies converge .",
    "+ isophote fitting was performed up to a count level of 2 @xmath39 i.e. , we stopped the fitting procedure when the isophote level is around twice the background dispersion , which corresponds to a surface magnitude of @xmath40 = 21.8 @xmath34 @xmath35 on the hst / nicmos images .",
    "this procedure is used to derive the luminosity profiles from both the tng and the hst images .",
    "+      similarly to profile extraction , luminosity profile fitting can be done using a wide variety of functions .",
    "the most common functions are the classical de vaucouleurs @xmath41 profile ( de vaucouleurs , 1948 ) , the exponential profile ( freeman , 1970 ) , and the most general srsic profile @xmath42 ( srsic , 1968 ) .",
    "generally , the @xmath41 profile describes very well the luminosity profile of bulges , while the exponential profile is used to fit the luminosity profile of disks .",
    "however , it was recently found that the @xmath41 function does not describe the bulge profile for many ellipticals correctly .",
    "therefore , many authors use the more general @xmath42 profile , as is the case for brown et al .",
    ". however , for 45% of our sample galaxies , we find that a single srsic profile still can not fit the data .",
    "therefore , we try a more general case using two srsic profiles in order to fit the inner and outer regions of the luminosity profiles respectively .",
    "we find that the outer profile regions are well fitted with a srsic index @xmath43 , equivalent to an exponential disk .",
    "the adopted fitting function has only 5 free parameters and can be written in the following form : @xmath44+i_{0 } exp\\big(-\\frac{r}r_{0}\\big)\\ ] ] in the above equation the first term corresponds to the srsic profile , where @xmath45 is the intensity at @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the radius that encloses half of the total luminosity of the bulge ( also known as the effective radius ) . for @xmath48 ,",
    "@xmath49 can be approximated ( with an error smaller than 0.1% ) by the relation @xmath50 ( ciotti 1991 ) .",
    "the second term corresponds to the exponential profile , where @xmath51 is the central intensity and @xmath52 is the length scale .",
    "however , as is pointed out by de jong et al .",
    "( 2004 ) the exponential luminosity profile does not prove that these galaxies have real disks .",
    "kinematic data is required to confirm the presence of a disk in any individual galaxy .",
    "+ figures 1a through 1s show the luminosity profile for all the galaxies of our sample . in these figures nicmos data are represented by squares while data from tng are represented by triangles .",
    "the fitting functions are also displayed for the bulge ( short dashed ) , disk ( long dashed ) and the sum of both components ( continuum line ) .",
    "the radius is in kpc ( horizontal bottom axis ) and @xmath53 ( horizontal upper axis ) .",
    "+ parameters described in the above equation were obtained using the nfit routine within stsdas ( schombert & bothun 1987 ) . the fitting procedure is carried out only in the @xmath54 portion of the galaxy surface brightness profiles .",
    "this is done to exlude the regions in the faint end of the luminosity profiles , in which the error is large and the information is poor .",
    "we also excluded the inner 3 pixels ( @xmath55 ) of the luminosity profiles in order to avoid any contamination resulting from the psf subtraction .",
    "the errors on the parameters are calculated following the method described by coenda et al .",
    "briefly , this technique consists in creating test images to which we artificially add and subtract a constant value corresponding to @xmath39 .",
    "we then extract the new luminosity profile as explained above and we fit it with equation [ dv+exp ] .",
    "these newly obtained parameters give us the respective upper and lower limits for the parameters .",
    "+ intensity parameters are then converted into surface brightness , expressed in @xmath34 @xmath35 by the equation @xmath56 , while units of @xmath57 , and @xmath58 are converted to kpc .",
    "measured errors for @xmath57 and @xmath58 are smaller than 15% while for @xmath59 , and @xmath60 are below 0.20 @xmath34 @xmath35 .",
    "total luminosities of both the bulge and the exponential components are finally computed using the derived photometric parameters and integrating separately both terms of eq .",

    "2 assumes that the galaxy is face on .",

    "unfortunately , we do not have enough information , such as velocity dispersions , to confirm this possibility .",

    "this result is unexpected since , as was pointed out in section 2 , most of these galaxies are simply reported in the literature as ellipticals .",

    "these authors find similar kormendy relations for a sample of 13 radio - quiet quasars , 10 radio - loud quasars and 10 radio galaxies .",
    "+ we also investigate the correlations for disks photometric parameters .",
    "results are shown in figs . 4c and 4d .",
    "disk parameters show the same trend as seen for bulge parameters .",
    "more explicitely , large disks have a lower central surface magnitude and have higher total luminosities .",

    ". this result could give further support to the idea that exponential profiles in these galaxies are truly due to the presence of a disk .",
    "however , as it is pointed out by de jong et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , this exponential distribution of light might not be in a disk configuration flattened by rotation as disks of spiral galaxies are .",
    "the fr  i and fr  ii classification is only based on the radio morphology of the source .",
    "we then chose another classification scheme which relies on the spectroscopic properties , and is more likely to reflect the physical properties of the central agn .",
    "in particular , we adopt the scheme defined by jackson & rawlings ( 1997 ) .",
    "they classify high and low ionization narrow - lined galaxies ( heg and leg ) on the basis of the equivalent width ( ew ) of the [ oiii]5007 emission line and/or the [ oii]/[oiii ] ratio .",
    "galaxies with [ oii]/[oiii ] @xmath93 1 and/or ew @xmath94 @xmath95 are defined as leg ( low excitation galaxies ) .",
    "similarly , quasars ( qso ) are defined as those sources for which at least one broad line has been observed .",
    "we find in our sample 22 fr  is ( corresponding to 27% of the sample ) , 22 legs ( 27% ) , 24 hegs ( 29% ) , and 13 qsos ( 16% ) .",
    "only two fr  ii objects remain unclassified ( 3c 277.3 and 3c 346 ) . as we pointed out in section 5 ,",
    "55% of fri galaxies show bulge + exponential type profiles , which is identical to the percentage obtained for legs .",
    "hegs show less galaxies with bulge + exponential profiles ( 43% ) , while qsos have only 31% of the galaxies with the exponential component .",
    "it is interesting to note that even if the fr  i classification is based on the radio morphology , it is known that most , if not all , fr  i galaxies are weak lined legs ( hine & longair , 1979 ; laing , 1994 ) .    summarizing , we divide our objects into the following spectral classification scheme : fr  is , legs , hegs and qsos , and we investigate the statistical properties of the host galaxies under this classification .",
    "table  4 lists the photometric parameters for each of these galaxy classes .",
    "all of them have bulges with similar average photometric properties , and even if fr  is have on average greater srsic indexes ( @xmath4 = 0.40 vs. @xmath4 @xmath5 0.34 ) the kolmogorov - smirnov test applied to these data does not indicate that the @xmath4 distribution for fr  i bulges is statistically different from that of legs , hegs or qsos .",
    "differences between these classes arise when we compare disk photometric parameters .",
    "fr  is have on average larger disks ( @xmath58 = 8.2 kpc ) and dimmer central surface magnitude ( @xmath96 ) than those of legs ( @xmath60 = 17.5 , @xmath58 = 4.3 ) , hegs ( @xmath60 = 17.5 , @xmath58 = 3.6 ) , and qsos ( @xmath60 = 17.5 , @xmath58 = 4.2 ) .",
    "however , statistical tests applied to the @xmath60 distributions show that fr  is differentiate only from hegs and qsos(99% confidence level ) and not from legs .",
    "same tests applied to @xmath58 data of these classes reveal that fr  is have a different distribution when compared with those of legs , hegs and qsos ( 99% confidence level ) .",
    "in other words , these results are similar to those obtained in the previous section .",
    "they suggest that , from a photometric point of view , fr  is are slightly different from legs , and these differences become stronger when fr  is are compared to hegs and qsos .",
    "we also ran statistical tests comparing fr  is + legs to hegs + qsos .",
    "results were similar to those described above but with a slightly less statistical significance ( 98% level ) .",
    "we find that fr  is + legs have on average @xmath97 @xmath34 @xmath35 and @xmath98 kpc , while hegs + qsos have @xmath99 @xmath34 @xmath35 and @xmath100 kpc .",
    "recent studies suggest that central super massive black holes ( smbh ) reside in all galaxies with a bulge , as a result of past quasar activity ( aller & rischstone 2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , smbh are claimed to be related to the host galaxy properties and therefore this implies that smbh and galaxy formation and evolution are closely correlated .",
    "kormendy & richstone ( 1995 ) showed that the mass of the smbh is correlated ( with a considerable scatter ) with both bulge luminosity and bulge mass .",
    "this result was later confirmed and strengthened by magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for a sample of nearby galaxies with kinematic data .",
    "+ on the other hand , it has also been shown that @xmath101 correlates with the srsic index @xmath4 ( graham et al .",
    "2003 , and references therein ) .",
    "these authors claim that the scatter of the @xmath102 relation is equivalent to the @xmath103 relation ( ferrarese & merrit , 2000 ; tremaine et al 2002 ) and it has the additional advantage of requiring only galaxy images rather than spectra .",
    "+ the superb quality of hst / nicmos images , together with ground based information for nearby objects , allows us to determine @xmath3 and @xmath4 with high accuracy .",
    "therefore we can estimate the black hole mass for each galaxy of the sample using both relations , and check whether the results are consistent .",
    "first of all we use the following relation with @xmath3 . as taken from marconi & hunt ( 2003 ) :    log(@xmath101 ) = 8.04 + 1.25 ( log(@xmath104 ) - 10.8 )    where @xmath101 is the mass of the black hole and @xmath105 is the total bulge luminosity in the h band in solar units .",
    "secondly , we use the graham & driver ( 2006 ) relation :    log(@xmath101 ) = 2.68 log(1/3@xmath4 ) + 7.82    where @xmath4 is the srsic index as expressed in equation [ dv+exp ] .",
    "we estimate the mass of the central black hole @xmath101 using the values of @xmath81 and @xmath4 as listed in table 2 , and the results are reported in fig .",
    "5 . in the figure",
    ", empty triangles and squares represent fr  i and fr  ii populations , respectively .",
    "the data show a large dispersion and the results obtained through these methods differ on average by a factor of three .",
    "we also used the quadratic @xmath106 relation instead of the linear one given by graham & driver ( 2006 ) and no major differences were observed .",
    "this result might reflect the fact that we do not find any correlation between @xmath81 and @xmath4 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "6 , neither fr  i nor fr  ii bulge luminosities correlate with the srsic index .",
    "note that similar bulge luminosity and @xmath4 distributions for fr  is and fr  iis also imply similar @xmath101 distribution for both sub samples .",
    "we have analyzed the infrared photometric parameters of 82 galaxies belonging to the 3cr catalogue . from the morphological point of view",
    "most of these galaxies are not yet classified , and classified galaxies are mostly ellipticals .",
    "nevertheless , we find that only 43 ( 52% ) of the galaxies have a single component luminosity profile .",
    "the remaining 39 galaxies ( 48% ) need a second component with @xmath4 = 1 suggesting the idea that these galaxies have an exponential disk .",
    "however , we can not confirm this possibility without additional kinematical information .",
    "when fr  is and fr  iis are differenciated we find the following results : + 1 ) forty five percent of fr  is show single luminosity profile while for fr  iis this percentage is 55% .",
    "reciprocally , 56% of fr  i galaxies show bulge+exponential type profiles compared to 44% of fr  ii galaxies .",
    "+ 2 ) analysis of the photometric parameters of both fr  i and fr  ii galaxies indicates that they have similar bulge and disk magnitudes .",
    "moreover , both fr  i and fr  2 bulges follow similar kormendy relations .",
    "even so , if we consider the exponential component we have that fr  is have , a ) dimmer central surface magnitudes and , b ) much larger scale lengths than fr  iis .",
    "k - s tests applied to the @xmath60 and @xmath58 distributions confirm these results at @xmath107 confidence level . + we also choose another classification scheme which relies on the spectroscopic properties , and is more likely to reflect the physical properties of the sources .",
    "we divided the sample galaxies in 4 groups , fr  is , legs , hegs and qsos .",
    "the results of the analysis were similar to those obtained with the previous classification .",
    "fr  i galaxies show again for the exponential component dimmer central surface magnitudes and much larger scale lengths than the rest of the selected classes ( @xmath107 confidence level ) .",
    "however , we also find that these differences are less conspicuous when fr  is are compared to legs .",
    "+ black hole masses were also calculated using two different methods , using the srsic index and the bulge total luminosity .",
    "results show a great dispersion and black hole masses obtained through @xmath3 are on average a factor of 3 higher than those obtained through @xmath4 .",
    "this result is not surprising since we did not find a clear correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "+ summarizing , past results on the host galaxies of fr  i and fr  ii sources gave confusing results on their properties and morphologies .",
    "thanks to the hst / nicmos data we can now probe deeply into the nuclear regions of the hosts and we can clearly distinguish the contributions from the host galaxies and the nuclear sources . we show that the host galaxies have very similar bulge properties while there seems to be a real difference in the properties or presence of disks .",
