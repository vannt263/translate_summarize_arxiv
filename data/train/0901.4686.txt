    "finite groups generated by reflections in a real euclidean space @xmath2 of @xmath1 dimensions , also called finite coxeter groups , are split into two classes : crystallographic and non - crystallographic groups @xcite .",
    "the crystallographic groups are the weyl groups of compact semisimple lie groups .",
    "they are an efficient tool for uniform description of the semisimple lie groups / algebras @xcite , and they have proven to be an indispensable tool in extensive computations with the representations of such lie groups or lie algebras ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) .    underlying such applications are two facts : ( i ) most of the computation can be performed in integers by working with the weight systems of the representations involved in a problem , and ( ii ) the weight system of a representation of a compact semisimple lie group / lie algebra consists of several weyl group orbits of the weights , many of them occurring more than once",
    ". practical importance of the orbits apparently emerged only in @xcite , where truly large scale computations were anticipated .",
    "the crystallographic coxeter groups are called weyl groups and denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "any finite coxeter group , crystallographic or not , is denoted by @xmath0 .",
    "a difference between the two cases which is of practical importance to us , is that , lattices with @xmath3-symmetries are common crystallographic lattices , while lattices of non - crystallographic types are dense everywhere in @xmath2 .",
    "non - crystallographic finite coxeter groups are of extensive use in modeling aperiodic point sets with long - range order ( ` quasicrystals ' ) @xcite . outside",
    "traditional mathematics and mathematical physics , a new line of application of coxeter group orbits can be found in @xcite ; see also the references therein .",
    "additional applications of weyl group orbits are found in @xcite .",
    "both crystallographic and non - crystallographic coxeter groups can be used for building families of orthogonal polynomials of many variables @xcite .    in recent years ,",
    "another field of applications of @xmath3-orbits is emerging in harmonic analysis .",
    "multidimensional fourier - like transforms were introduced and are currently being explored in @xcite , where @xmath3-orbits are used to define families of special functions , called orbit functions @xcite , which serve as the kernels of the transforms .",
    "they differ from the traditional special functions @xcite .",
    "the number of variables , on which the new functions depend , is equal to the rank of a compact semisimple lie group that provides the weyl group .",
    "two properties of the transforms stand out : such special functions are orthogonal when integrated over a finite region @xmath4 , and they are also orthogonal when summed up over lattice points @xmath5 .",
    "the lattices can be of any density , their symmetries are prescribed by the lie groups .",
    "application of the non - crystallographic groups in fourier analysis is at its very beginning @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we have no compelling reason to distinguish crystallographic and non - crystallographic reflection groups of finite order .",
    "hence , we consider all finite coxeter groups although from the infinitely many finite coxeter groups in 2 dimensions ( symmetry groups of regular polygons ) , we usually consider only the lowest few .",
    "an orbit @xmath6 of a coxeter group @xmath0 is the set of points in @xmath2 generated by @xmath0 from a single seed point @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath0-orbits are not common objects in the literature , nor is their multiplication , which can be viewed in parallel to the multiplication of @xmath0-invariant polynomials @xmath8 introduced in subsection 6.1 ( for more about the polynomials see @xcite and the references therein).-invariant ones .",
    "we are not concerned about any other of their properties .",
    "] indeed , the set of exponents of all the monomials in @xmath8 is the set of points of the orbit @xmath6 .    in this paper",
    ", we have adopted a point of view according to which the orbits @xmath6 , being simpler than the polynomials @xmath8 or the weight systems of representations , are the primary objects of study .",
    "the relation between the orbits of @xmath3 and the weight systems of finite dimensional irreducible representations of semisimple lie groups / algebras over @xmath9 , can be understood as follows .",
    "the character of a particular representation involves summation over the weight system of the representation , i.e. over several @xmath3-orbits . as for which orbits appear in a particular representation , this is a well known question about multiplicities of dominant weights .",
    "there is a laborious but rather fast computer algorithm for calculating the multiplicities .",
    "extensive tables of multiplicities can be found in @xcite ; see also the references therein .",
    "thus one is justified in assuming that the relation between a representation and a particular @xmath3-orbit is known in all cases of interest .",
    "numerical characteristics , such as congruence classes , indices of various degrees , and anomaly numbers , introduced here for @xmath3-orbits , mirror similar properties of weight systems from representation theory , which are often used in applications ( for example @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce operations on @xmath3-orbits that are well known for weight systems of representations : ( i ) the product of @xmath3-orbits ( of the same group ) and its decomposition into the sum of @xmath3-orbits ; ( ii ) the decomposition of the @xmath10-th power of a @xmath3-orbit symmetrized by the group of permutations of @xmath10 elements .",
    "new is the introduction of such operations for the orbits of non - crystallographic coxeter groups .",
    "we intend to describe reductions of @xmath0-orbits to orbits of a subgroup @xmath11 in a separate paper @xcite .",
    "again , the involvement of non - crystallographic groups makes the reduction problem rather unusual .",
    "corresponding applications deserve to be explored .",
    "the decomposition of products of orbits of coxeter groups , as introduced here , is the core of other decomposition problems in mathematics , such as the decomposition of direct products of representations of semisimple lie groups , the decomposition of products of certain special functions @xcite and the decomposition of products of @xmath0-invariant polynomials of several variables @xcite .",
    "the last two problems are completely solved in terms of orbit decompositions .",
    "the first problem requires that the multiplicities of dominant weights in weight systems of representations @xcite be known .",
    "we view the @xmath0-orbits from a perspective uncommon in the literature .",
    "namely , the points of a @xmath0-orbit are taken to be vertices of an @xmath1-dimensional @xmath0-invariant polytope centered at origin , @xmath1 being the number of elementary reflections generating @xmath0 ( at the same time it is the rank of the corresponding semisimple lie group ) .",
    "the multiplication of two such polytopes / orbits , say @xmath12 and @xmath13 , is the set of points / vertices obtained by adding to every point of @xmath12 every point of @xmath13 .",
    "the resulting set of points is again @xmath0-invariant and thus it is a union ( we say ` sum ' ) of several @xmath0-orbits ( we say ` @xmath0-polytopes ' ) .",
    "thus we have a ring of @xmath0-polytopes with positive integer coefficients .",
    "we recall and illustrate a general method of description of @xmath1-dimensional reflection - generated polytopes @xcite .",
    "the core of our geometric interpretation of orbits as polytopes is in the paragraph following equation .",
    "a product of orbits is a union of concentric orbits .",
    "geometrically this can be seen as an ` onion'-like layered structure of orbits of different radii . unlike in representation theory , where orbit points are always points of the corresponding weight lattices , in our case the seed point of an orbit can be anywhere in @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , a suitable choice of the seed points of the orbits , which are being multiplied , can bring some of the layers of the ` onion ' structure as close or as far apart as desired .",
    "two examples are given in the last section ( see and ) .",
    "let @xmath14 and @xmath15 be vectors in @xmath2 .",
    "we denote by @xmath16 the reflection in the @xmath17-dimensional ` mirror ' orthogonal to @xmath14 and passing through the origin . for any @xmath18",
    ", we have @xmath19 here @xmath20 denotes scalar product in @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath21 and @xmath22 so that @xmath23 .",
    "a coxeter group @xmath0 is by definition generated by several reflections in mirrors that have the origin as their common point .",
    "various coxeter groups are thus specified by the set @xmath24 of vectors @xmath14 , orthogonal to the mirrors and called the simple roots of @xmath0 .",
    "consequently , @xmath0 is given once the relative angles between elements of @xmath24 are given .",
    "a standard presentation of @xmath0 , generated by @xmath1 reflections , amounts to the following relations @xmath25 where we have simplified the notation by setting @xmath26 , and where @xmath27 are the lowest possible positive integers .",
    "the matrix @xmath28 specifies the group .",
    "the angles between the mirrors of reflections @xmath29 and @xmath30 are determined from the values of the exponents @xmath27 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath31 , the angle is @xmath32 , while the angle between @xmath33 and @xmath34 is @xmath35 .",
    "the classification of finite reflection ( coxeter ) groups was accomplished in the first half of the 20th century .",
    "there is just one group of order 2 .",
    "its two elements are @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we denote this group by @xmath39 . acting on a point @xmath40 of the real line",
    ", the group @xmath39 generates its orbit of two points , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , except if @xmath42 .",
    "then the orbit consists of just one point , namely the origin .",
    "there are infinitely many coxeter groups in @xmath44 , one for each @xmath45 .",
    "their orders are @xmath46 . in physics literature , these are the dihedral groups",
    ".    note that for @xmath47 , the group is a product of two groups from @xmath48 .",
    "the reflection mirrors are orthogonal .",
    "our notation for the lowest five groups , generated by two reflections , and their orders , is as follows : @xmath49      a convenient general way to provide a specific set @xmath24 is to draw a graph where vertices are traditionally shown as small circles , one for each @xmath50 , and where edges indicate absence of orthogonality between two vertices linked by an edge .",
    "a diagram consisting of several disconnected components means that the group is a product of several pairwise commuting subgroups .",
    "thus it is often sufficient to consider only the groups with connected diagrams .    in this paper ,",
    "a coxeter diagram is a graph providing only relative angles between simple roots while ignoring their lengths .",
    "this is done by writing @xmath27 over the edges of the diagram . by convention ,",
    "the most frequently occurring value , @xmath51 , is not shown in the diagrams .",
    "when @xmath52 , the edge is not drawn , i.e. the nodes numbered @xmath53 and @xmath54 are not directly connected .",
    "consider the examples of coxeter diagrams of all finite non - crystallographic coxeter groups with connected diagrams .",
    "note that we simply write @xmath55 when @xmath56 .",
    "a dynkin diagram is a graph providing , in addition to the relative angles , the relative lengths of the vectors from @xmath24 .",
    "dynkin diagrams are used for the crystallographic coxeter groups , frequently called the weyl groups .",
    "there are four infinite series of classical groups and five isolated cases of exceptional simple lie groups .",
    "here is a complete list of dynkin diagrams of such groups ( with connected diagrams ) :    the names of the groups , as is traditional in lie theory , are shown on the left of each diagram .",
    "open ( black ) circles indicate longer ( shorter ) roots .",
    "the ratio of their square lengths is @xmath57 in all cases except for @xmath58 where the ratio is @xmath59 .",
    "moreover , we adopt the usual convention that @xmath60 . a single , double , and triple line indicates respectively the angle @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 between the roots , or equivalently , the angles @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 between the reflection mirrors .",
    "the absence of a direct link between two nodes implies that the corresponding simple roots , as well as the mirrors , are orthogonal .",
    "note that the relative angles of the mirrors of @xmath67 and @xmath68 coincide .",
    "hence their @xmath3-groups are isomorphic .",
    "their simple roots differ by length .",
    "we adopt the dynkin numbering of nodes .",
    "the numbering proceeds from left to right @xmath69 in case of @xmath70 and @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , the node above the main line has the highest number , respectively @xmath1 , 6 , 7 , 8 .",
    "orders of the finite coxeter groups are provided in table  1 for groups with connected diagrams .",
    "when a diagram has several disconnected components , the order is the product of orders corresponding to each subdiagram .",
    ".orders of the finite coxeter groups . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      triangle anomaly numbers were introduced in physics @xcite as quantities assigned to irreducible representations of a few compact semisimple lie groups and calculated from the weight systems of their representations .",
    "constraints on possible models in particle physics were imposed in terms of admissible values of the anomaly numbers of representations involved in a particular model .",
    "generalization of the concept to all compact semisimple lie groups and to higher than third degree anomaly number originates in @xcite .",
    "our goal here is to show that the anomaly numbers can be used also for constituents of the weight systems of irreducible representations , namely for @xmath3-orbits and more generally , for the orbits @xmath6 of any finite coxeter group .",
    "the anomaly number @xmath74 of degree @xmath75 of the orbit @xmath6 of the coxeter group @xmath0 is defined as follows , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a special vector passing through the origin .",
    "in particular , @xmath78 in all cases . the anomaly number of physics literature is @xmath79 , therefore it is the only one we consider .",
    "frequently used property of @xmath79 is the decomposition of the product of two orbits , which is the analog of : @xmath80    in general terms , the direction of @xmath77 can be characterized as follows .",
    "suppose @xmath3 in is the weyl group of a compact simple lie group @xmath0 , and that @xmath0 has a maximal reductive subgroup of type @xmath81 .",
    "then the direction of @xmath77 is given by the direction corresponding to @xmath82 in the euclidean space spanned by the roots of @xmath0 .",
    "the first question to answer is when such a maximal subgroup is present . for a complete list of the cases",
    "see below @xcite : @xmath83\\\\ b_n & \\supset b_{n-1}\\times u(1 ) \\qquad & & n\\geq3\\\\ c_n & \\supset a_{n-1}\\times u(1 ) \\qquad & & n\\geq2\\\\ d_n & \\supset a_{n-1}\\times u(1 ) \\qquad & & n\\geq4\\\\ d_n & \\supset d_{n-1}\\times u(1 ) \\qquad & & n\\geq5\\\\ e_6 & \\supset d_5\\times u(1 ) \\\\",
    "e_7 & \\supset e_6\\times u(1 ) \\end{alignedat}\\ ] ] as long as each orbit of a given group contains with every weight also its negative , the anomaly numbers are equal to zero . therefore the interesting cases that remain are found in @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 . in physics , however , only the anomaly numbers of @xmath86 are used so far .",
    "anomaly numbers of @xmath55 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 are also defined by . in those cases",
    ", however , the direction of @xmath77 has to be determined differently since there is no @xmath82 subgroup .",
    "instead , one can require that @xmath77 be orthogonal to selected simple roots : @xmath89 for @xmath55 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 for @xmath87 , and @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 for @xmath88 .",
    "anomaly numbers for @xmath55 are zero for all orbits .",
    "they will be considered elsewhere @xcite , along with the anomaly numbers of other non - crystallographic groups .",
    "1 .   useful and interesting objects may turn out to be @xmath0-orbits with each point decorated by a sign @xcite according to the following rule . the dominant point ,",
    "say @xmath92 , and all points obtained from it by an even number of reflections generating @xmath0 , carry a positive sign , while all points of the orbit obtained from @xmath92 by an odd number of reflections carry a negative sign .",
    "let us call an @xmath93-orbit a decorated orbit of @xmath92 of @xmath0 , while the orbits without the sign decoration , i.e. all positive signs , are called @xmath94-orbits of @xmath92 of @xmath0 . in order to avoid ambiguities",
    ", it should be stipulated that @xmath92 of an @xmath93-orbit must have all coordinates positive in @xmath95-basis .",
    "+ multiplication of such orbits follows simple rules : @xmath96 in , all coefficients in the decomposition of the product are positive integers , while in and , all such coefficients are integers , but not all may be positive .",
    "+ the decomposition of many products of @xmath94-orbits with lowest nontrivial @xmath93-orbit can be directly inferred from the tables @xcite , using the weyl character formula .",
    "2 .   in the examples",
    ", we often required that a @xmath0-orbit consist of points of the weight lattice @xmath97 .",
    "very few properties of the orbits would have been lost , had we instead allowed @xmath7 .",
    "the congruence classes would not then be applicable .",
    "+ consider the following products of @xmath98 orbits as examples : @xmath99 the radii of the two orbits in the decomposition can be drawn arbitrarily close by a suitable choice of @xmath100 , and in they can be pushed as far apart as desired by the choice of @xmath40 .",
    "the second orbit in has a radius equal to @xmath101 .",
    "3 .   for a geometric interpretation of orbits as polytopes , refer to the paragraph following equation .",
    "the ` interaction ' ( i.e. product ) between two concentric orbit - layers results in the layered structure of orbits .",
    "they are subject to the equality of indices of various degrees , congruence numbers , relations between anomaly numbers .",
    "speculative interpretation can go further : consider @xmath102 as the ` energy ' of the orbit and @xmath103 as the ` energy ' of the interacting pair , etc .",
    "although we did not pursue it here , orbit multiplication can be viewed as an ` interaction ' between two orbits similarly as used in particle physics to view interacting multiplets of particles .",
    "a multiplet is described by the weight system of an irreducible representation of the corresponding lie group / algebra . here",
    ", the role of the multiplet would be given to the set of points of an orbit .",
    "in both cases , such interactions would be governed by the strict equality of indices of various degrees , congruence numbers , relations between anomaly numbers .",
    "but there is a price to pay for such a reinterpretation of multiplets : the overall invariance of the theory with respect to the lie group would be reduced to the invariance with respect to the coxeter group , or to its ( discrete ) image ` lifted ' into the lie group @xcite .",
    "it would be useful to ask additional questions about the properties of indices and anomaly numbers of various degrees .",
    "such questions can be answered by adaptation of the methods used for the weight system of representations @xcite .",
    "6 .   in place of finite coxeter groups",
    ", we could have chosen to consider other finite groups for similar considerations @xcite .",
    "the immediate motivations for our choice were recent applications in harmonic analysis , where @xmath3-orbits are playing a fundamental role . equally interesting",
    "would be to consider orbits of infinite coxeter groups .",
    "( a coxeter group with connected diagram is of infinite order if its diagram is different from those listed in section  2 . )",
    "the orbits of representations of kac - moody algebras would be relatively easily amenable to such a study .",
    "similarly , we could consider orbits of two or more seed points .",
    "a simple example is the root system of the group @xmath58 .",
    "choosing as the two seed points one short root and one long root , say @xmath90 and @xmath104 , the orbit of the pair is a star - like polygon formed by the root system of @xmath58 .",
    "an interesting problem appears to be to pursue a similar study of orbits of the even subgroups of coxeter groups , particularly because these subgroups are not coxeter groups in general .",
