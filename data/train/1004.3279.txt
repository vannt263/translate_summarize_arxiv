    "superconducting devices based on josephson junctions have successfully been used in many different kinds of applications , including very sensitive magnetometers based on superconducting interference devices ( squids ) , bolometric detectors , mixers , and parametric amplifiers .",
    "they have also been suggested to be strong candidates as building blocks for a quantum computer @xcite .",
    "they are easily fabricated with standard lithographic techniques and can be integrated with other electrical circuits .",
    "this gives them the potential to be scalable .",
    "devices utilizing charging effects include very small tunnel junctions .",
    "such coulomb blockade devices , are also widely used in measurements , for example , the single electron transistors ( set)@xcite . the radio frequency version of the set is the worlds most sensitive electrometer @xcite .    the single cooper - pair box ( scb ) @xcite is one of the simplest coulomb blockade devices , involving a single josephson junction .",
    "scbs are very sensitive to the presence of quasiparticles which suggested its use as potential radiation detector @xcite",
    ". the presence of quasiparticles can be measured by detecting the charge on the scb island using an external set @xcite . in this paper , we characterize an intrinsic method for reading out the scb which relies on the curvature of its energy bands .",
    "this methods is both faster and is predicted to have less backaction then using a set .",
    "the curvature of the energy bands of the scb ( with respect to gate charge ) gives rise to the so called quantum capacitance @xcite and has been utilized in a number of experiments , for example in the measurements on longitudinal dresses states of a driven scb @xcite .",
    "it has also been used to study the ground state of two coupled qubits @xcite , and to study quasiparticle poisoning of a scb qubit @xcite . in ref .",
    "they used a resonator with a bandwidth of 200 khz which limited the speed the their measurements . here",
    "we use the random tunneling of quasiparticles to characterize the performance of the quantum capacitance readout .",
    "we show that we can measure the state of the scb an order of magnitude faster than has previously been reported , including measurements using rf - sets .",
    "we also show that we can prepare the scb in a certain parity state with a high probability .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : theory ] , we present the theory behind the readout technique of using the quantum capacitance . in section",
    "[ sec : fabrication ] , we show how the samples were designed and fabricated and then in section  [ sec : measurements ] we present the measurements done to characterize the readout .",

    "the scb for sample b is the same except that the island is 8 @xmath0 m long in order to increase the gate capacitance .",
    "the island is connected to a reservoir through two small josephson junctions in a squid geometry .",
    "the potential of the island is controlled by three different capacitive gates .",
    "one large rf gate , @xmath1 , ( on the top ) is connected to the resonator and used for the readout .",
    "in addition , there is a dc gate , @xmath2 , used to bias the scb at the working point and a microwave gate , @xmath3 , used for spectroscopy .",
    "( c ) a schematic of the device .",
    "the parallel resonator consists of two metal layers separated by a thin insulating layer .",

    "the scb consist of a superconducting island connected to a large reservoir by a josephson junction .",
    "the josephson junction is made in a squid - configuration to allow the josephson energy , @xmath6 , to be tuned by applying a magnetic field through the loop .",
    "the scb is also characterized by the electrostatic energy , @xmath7 , which is the energy required to add an extra cooper pair to the island . here",
    "@xmath8 is the number of cooper pairs that have tunneled onto the island and @xmath9 is the normalized gate voltage , where @xmath10 is the capacitance between the voltage source and the island .",
    "if the capacitance of the island , @xmath11 , is small enough the cooper - pair charging energy , @xmath12 , will dominate over the josephson energy , @xmath6 , and the temperature , @xmath13 . in this case",
    "the charge fluctuation on the island will be small .",
    "the number of excess cooper pairs on the island , @xmath8 , is then a good quantum number and the charge of the island can be well controlled by the external gate voltage , @xmath14 . for @xmath15 and @xmath16 , only two charge states will be of interest : @xmath17 and @xmath18 , corresponding to zero ( @xmath19 ) or one ( @xmath20 ) extra cooper pair on the island .",
    "then the hamiltonian of the cooper - pair box can be written @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 are the pauli spin matrices . here",
    "we have ignored all state independent terms of the hamiltonian .",
    "the two eigenenergies for this hamiltonian are plotted in fig .",

    "@xmath24 , where the electrostatic energies of the two charge states cross , we get an avoided level crossing with a splitting between the ground and excited state equal to @xmath6 . in the same graph , we have also plotted the expectation value of the island charge @xmath25 for each energy eigenstate .      at the degeneracy",
    "point the energy difference between the ground and excited state is , to first order , independent of the gate charge @xmath4 , which makes this the ideal bias point when the scb is used as a qubit . at this point ,",
    "the longest dephasing times are obtained @xcite .",
    "therefore , this is often called the optimal point .",
    "if we want to detect the state of the scb sitting at the optimal point , we can not measure the charge , since the charges of the ground and exited state are the same at this point ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : device](d ) ) .",
    "although the charges are the same for the two states , the derivatives of the charges with respect to the gate voltage differ and can be used for readout .",
    "we can define an effective capacitance of the scb by calculating @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the average value of the injected charge on the gate capacitor .",
    "this effective capacitance , @xmath28 , will have two contributions , a geometric part @xmath29 consisting of the gate capacitance in series with the junction capacitance , and a state dependent part that we call the quantum capacitance @xcite .",
    "this quantum capacitance , @xmath5 , takes the following form @xmath30 for the ground ( g ) and first excited ( e ) state , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the energy difference between the two states at a given @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 is equal in magnitude but has opposite signs for the ground and excited state , with @xmath5 being negative for the ground state . in fig .",
    "[ fig : device](e ) , @xmath5 is plotted against the gate charge , @xmath4 , for the ground and exited state of the scb .",
    "if we embed the scb in a resonant tank circuit ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : device](c ) ) the effect of the quantum capacitance will be to shift the resonance frequency .",
    "the reflection coefficient , @xmath33 , since there are no dissipative element in the resonator .",
    "the phase @xmath34 , however has a sharp frequency dependence and close to the resonance frequency of the tank circuit , @xmath35 , the phase , @xmath34 , can be approximated by the expression : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the angular probe frequency and @xmath38 is the external quality factor of the resonator .",
    "now , if the capacitance of the scb is changed by a magnitude of @xmath39 , the phase of the rf signal at frequency @xmath40 reflected off the resonator will change by : @xmath41 here we have treated the resonator purely classically . a full quantum treatment , including the scb , resonator and transmission line can be found in the work of johansson _ et al .",
    "it is shown that this method of readout is quantum limited @xcite , meaning that no information is lost during the readout ( no extra dephasing ) .",
    "quasiparticles are single - particle excitations of the superconducting condensate .",
    "quasiparticle fluctuations have been studied as a source of noise in superconducting devices for some time .",
    "thermodynamic fluctuations in the quasiparticle number , also know as generation - recombination noise , is an important source of noise at intermediate temperatures @xcite .",
    "time - resolved measurements of these fluctuations have shown very good agreement between theory and experiment @xcite . at very low temperatures , were thermal quasiparticles should be suppressed , a significant population of quasiparticles is still observed in most experiments .",
    "the origin of these nonequilibrium quasiparticles is still unknown .",
    "however , it is clear that they remain an important source of noise .",
    "the most significant source of quasiparticle noise in a scb is commonly referred to as quasiparticle poisoning .",
    "when a nonequilibrium quasiparticle in the reservoir tunnels onto the scb island , it shifts the potential of the island by @xmath42 .",
    "the random tunneling of quasiparticles on and off of the island , therefore leads to a large - amplitude telegraph noise in the island potential .",
    "quasiparticle poisoning has been extensively studied @xcite , including the observation of individual tunneling events in real time @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that poisoning is well described by a simple kinetic model , starting from the assumption of a finite density of nonequilibrium quasiparticles in the leads . in this model ,",
    "the tunneling rates are then dictated by the relative energies of the even ( no quasiparticles on the island ) and odd ( one quasiparticle on the island ) states .",
    "if the energy of the odd state is lower than the even state , the quasiparticle can be trapped on the island ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : measurements](a ) ) .",
    "the energy difference of the even and odd state is maximum at the charge degeneracy point , @xmath24 , where it takes the value @xmath43 .",
    "here @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the superconducting energy gap of the island and the reservoir , respectively .",
    "the average occupation of the two states is then simply determined by the boltzmann factor @xmath46 .",
    "when designing the readout circuit there is a trade off between having a good signal ( large phase shift ) and a low backaction .",
    "the phase shift is roughly proportional to @xmath47 ( see equation [ eq : phase_shift ] ) , meaning that for a fixed q - value ( _ i.e. _ measurement bandwidth ) we want a small total capacitance in the resonator ( and a large inductance ) .",
    "however , the voltage noise of the environment will induce charge fluctuations on the scb , with a magnitude that scales with the same prefactor .",
    "thus , by decreasing the total capacitance in the resonator , @xmath48 , you can increase the sensitivity ( larger phase shift ) at the cost of a larger backaction on the scb .",
    "the q - value of the resonator sets the bandwidth , _",
    "i.e. _ an upper limit on how fast we can measure .",
    "we designed the resonator to have an external q - value of 100 which corresponds to a time constant of 50 ns at @xmath49 mhz .",
    "the internal q - value is usually substantially larger and can therefore be ignored .",
    "the devices were fabricated in a multilayer process .",
    "starting from a high - resistivity silicon wafer with a native oxide , the wafer was first cleaned using rf back sputtering directly after which a 60 nm thick layer of niobium was sputtered . to pattern the niobium",
    ", we used a 20 nm thick al mask made by e - beam lithography and e - beam evaporation .",
    "the niobium was then etched in a cf@xmath50 plasma ( with a small flow of oxygen ) to form the inductor and bottom plates of the capacitors ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : device](c ) ) .",
    "the choice of niobium for the bottom layer made it possible to test the resonator in liquid helium ( even with a top layer made of normal metal , _",
    "e.g. _ gold ) .",
    "the al mask was removed with a wet - etch solution based on phosphoric acid . before depositing the insulator we cleaned the wafer in a 2% hf solution for 30 sec in order to remove most of the niobium oxide which has been found to degrade the q - value of the niobium resonators .",
    "using pe - cvd , we then deposited an insulating layer of 200 nm of silicon nitride .",
    "the silicon nitride layer covers the whole wafer ; connections to the niobium layer are only made through capacitors .",
    "we chose silicon nitride since it is known to have low dielectric losses @xcite .",
    "after using a combination of duv photolithography to define bonding pads along with e - beam lithography to define quasiparticle traps @xcite , a 3/80/10 nm thick layer of ti / au / pd was deposited by e - beam evaporation .",
    "finally , the layer containing the scb was made by e - beam lithography and two - angle shadow evaporation of 10 + 30 nm of aluminum , with 6 min of oxidation at 4 mbar .",
    "the thickness of the island ( 10 nm ) was chosen to be much thinner than for the reservoir ( 30 nm ) in order to enhance the superconducting gap , @xmath51 , of the island compared to the reservoir .",
    "this was done to reduce quasiparticle poisoning .",
    "the device was cooled in a dilution refrigerator with a base temperature of about 20 mk . for the readout",

    "the signal was heavily attenuated and filtered and was fed to the tank circuit via a pamtech circulator positioned at the mixing chamber .",

    "it is heavily attenuated and coupled through a circulator located at the mixing chamber and filtered through two rlc waveguide filters before reaching the resonator . on the way up , the signal is first amplified at 4.2k with a quinstar amplifier with noise temperature of 1 k and then amplified again at room temperature with a mini - circuit amplifier . before the signal is finally digitized using an aeroflex 3030 vector analyzer ( with a 33 mhz bandwidth ) , it is first filtered using an rlc bandpass filter to reject image noise . ]      in the following sections we will show measurements of two different devices , referred to as sample a and sample b. in order to characterize the devices and extract parameters , the resonator was first measured using a network analyzer . from the measured phase response we could extract the resonance frequency , @xmath40 , and the q - value of the resonator .",
    "we could extract both the cooper - pair charging energy , @xmath52 , and the maximum josephson energy , @xmath53 by conventional spectroscopy , while applying a perpendicular magnetic field through the squid loop of the scb , and thereby tuning @xmath6 . finally by measuring @xmath5 as a function of gate charge",
    ", we can extract the rf gate capacitance and the total resonator capacitance . from the expression for the q - value and the resonance frequency",
    ", we can then extract the parameters for the individual components of the resonator .",

    "the rate of the dc sweep was fast compared to the quasiparticle tunneling rate , such that the quasiparticle tunneling probability during one period was low .",

    "we have fabricated and measured a number of samples .",

    "the switching between these parities happens on the time scale of a few microseconds .",
    "although this is far from ideal for many applications , it has given us a way to characterize the readout .",
    "when a quasiparticle tunnels on or off the island the quantum capacitance of the scb will change , and can thus be detected as a change in the reflected phase from the resonator . the measured time averaged phase for sample b",

    "[ fig : measurements](c ) we show the time dependence of the phase measured at the degeneracy point , @xmath24 .",
    "most of the time the scb is in the odd state with a phase shift of about 0 degrees , however now and then the extra quasiparticle escapes the island and the scb spends short periods in the even state with a phase shift close to -30 degrees .    while sitting at the degeneracy point , @xmath24 , we have also performed pulsed measurements of the state .",
    "we send down a gaussian pulse , with a length defined as the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , and measure the phase of the reflected pulse . in order to optimize the signal to noise of the measured response",

    "this is done for both i and q and we can calculate the phase by @xmath58 .",
    "we perform 100 000 of these measurements and make histograms of the measured phase and see two peaks centered at different phases corresponding to the two parity states .",
    "we fit a double gaussian ( both with the same standard deviation ) to the histograms ( see fig .  [",

    "we see that the snr roughly follows the expected square root dependence on the measurement time .",
