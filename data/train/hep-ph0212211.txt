    "at present , standard model ( sm ) not only has theoretical shortcoming but also must face to the experimental difficulties . the recent measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment by the experiment e821 @xcite disagrees with the sm expectations and there are also convincing evidences that neutrinos are massive and oscillate in flavor@xcite .",
    "it seems to indicate the presence of new physics just round the corner will be in the leptonic part . as probing new physics , lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) processes have as natural consequence an increased interest experimentally and theoretically .",
    "several experiments that may considerably improve on lepton flavor violating processes , such as the two - body lfv of bosons , @xmath4 and @xmath5 lfv decays , are under consideration .",
    "for example , the tesla linear collider project will work at the @xmath6 resonance , reaching a @xmath6 production rate of @xmath7 per year @xcite .",
    "a number of theoretical studies are devoted to these lfv decays to investigate the new physics effects @xcite . for @xmath0 meson",
    ", bes @xcite has accumulated about @xmath8 - @xmath9 @xmath0 events which can be available to probe lepton flavor violation of @xmath0 @xcite . in this note , we study the lfv processed of the heavy vector bosons , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 with some models beyond sm .",
    "the lfv decays of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , such as @xmath10 , are absent in sm at tree level because of the strong gim suppression .",
    "they are strongly suppressed by powers of small neutrino masses and have very small branching ratios .",
    "experimentally , there are no clear bounds of these decays . then , such decays give therefore existence room of new physics .",
    "@xcite discuss these flavor decays by using the simple `` unitarity inspired '' relations and get rather strong model - independent constraints on these two - body lfv processes @xmath11 from the above constraints , we can see perhaps bes could observe some of these processes .",
    "in fact , in many models beyond sm , there exist many bosons ( scalars or vectors ) , such as leptoquarks in guts , sleptons in susy and @xmath12 in technicolor models , which can induce the lfv decays at tree level and contribute large branching ratios . in many guts ,",
    "the existence of leptoquarks is predicted , which has been actively searched in many collider experiments @xcite .",
    "these new particles , which carry both the lepton and quark numbers , can couple to a current comprising of a lepton and a quark @xcite .",
    "thus , they can lead to the vertices @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and so on .",
    "recently , refs . @xcite investigate the muon anomalous magnetic moment with the leptoquarks and get the restricting parameter space .",
    "leptoquarks can induce the quarknioums decay to @xmath15 through @xmath16-channel .",
    "the similar situation is in susy models without lepton number conservation and r - parity which the squarks play the same role as leptoquarks in guts@xcite . although the present experiment constraint those couplings in various ways , the r - parity violating coupling may give large contribution to @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and so on .    in topcolor",
    "assisted technicolor ( tc2 ) models@xcite , when the non - universal interactions , topcolor interactions are written in the mass eigenstates , it may lead to the flavor changing coupling vertices of the new gauge boson @xmath12 , such as @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the @xmath12 has significant contributions to the lepton flavor changing process , like @xmath19 , and may have severe bound on the mass @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "@xmath12 can also , but different from leptoquarks and sleptons , induce the decays of quarknioums to @xmath15 through @xmath21-channel .",
    "we investigate the bounds of @xmath22 with model - independent analysis in sec .",
    "2 . then , in sec.3 , we study these bounds with model - dependent analysis in three models , leptoquarks , susy and technicolor , respectively .",
    "we give our conclusion in the last section .",
    "considering that a vector boson @xmath24 , such as @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , couples to @xmath25 , the effective coupling between the vector boson @xmath24 and @xmath25 as @xmath26 and @xcite @xmath27 where mass scale @xmath28 is introduced to make the form factors @xmath29 dimensionless . for on - shell vector mesons ,",
    "the @xmath30 form factors do not contribute . with this langragian",
    ", we can calculate the decay @xmath31 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in the limit @xmath32 , we can obtain @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the charge of quark in the quarkoniums , @xmath35 for @xmath0 and @xmath1 and @xmath36 for @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath37 is the vector meson decay constants and no relate to the effective coupling @xmath38 .",
    "similarly , we can get lfv decay width @xmath39    using above equations and compared to the standard decays @xmath40 @xmath41 and @xmath42 we obtain @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the total decay width of the vector bosons @xmath45 and @xmath46    by using the experimental bounds of @xmath47 and the experimental values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xcite , we could obtain the bounds of @xmath50 . for discussing the bounds , as like doing in @xcite , we consider two limiting cases :    * when @xmath51 or @xmath52 . from eq.(7 ) , we get @xmath53 similarly , by using @xmath54 and the experimental values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xcite @xmath57 * when @xmath51 or @xmath58 .",
    "we get @xmath59 similarly , @xmath60    from the above equations , we find some of them ( eqs .",

    "many models beyond sm , like guts , naturally contain leptoquarks which can couple to a lepton - quark pair .",
    "this can induce the lfv two - body decays of @xmath0 and @xmath2 through @xmath16-channel ( see fig .",

    "3 ) . compared to electroweak decay @xmath79 , this gives a branching ratio of @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the effective electroweak couplings . by using the experimental values , @xmath82 and @xmath83",

    "the superpotential for the lepton number violation supersymmetry can be written as : @xmath89 the @xmath90 represents the r - parity conservation sector supersymmetry and can be found in literatures@xcite .",
