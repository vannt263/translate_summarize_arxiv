    "in recent years , much attention has been focused on the early history of star formation , in particular , the rise of the sfr to its peak around @xmath1 ( e.g. , fall , charlot , & pei 1996 , madau 1996 , giavalisco 2004 , prez - gonzlez 2008 , bouwens 2008 ) .",
    "such a rapid rise is not surprising considering the dynamical timescales of galaxy - sized structures and the lifetimes of stars .",
    "more surprising , perhaps , is the precipitous decline in the global sfr since @xmath2  more than a factor of 10 lower than its peak value , and falling fast ( e.g. , lilly  1996 , schiminovich 2005 , hopkins & beacom2006 , villar 2008 ) .",
    "this is remarkable not only for its rapidity but also because it appears to mark our epoch as the beginning of the end of galactic star formation .",
    "it is now clear that the unexpected prevalence of starforming galaxies in rich galaxy clusters discovered by butcher & oemler ( 1978 ) , long regarded as a cluster phenomenon , is universal , as starforming galaxies  great and small  surrender youthful vigor and fade towards oblivion in only a few billion years .    using the wide field of the inamori - magellan areal camera and spectrograph ( imacs ) on magellan - baade , the _ imacs cluster building survey _ ( icbs )",
    "is focused on the study of galaxy infall and evolution from @xmath3 mpc into cluster cores . because the projected density of cluster / supercluster members is low at such large radii , our near - complete samples necessarily include @xmath41000  field \" galaxies at redshift @xmath5 per survey field .",
    "this gives us an opportunity to compare galaxy evolution in clusters with the field over this epoch . from these data we report in this _",
    "letter _ on the significant decline in sfr and sbf since @xmath6 .",
    "the data discussed here come from 4 fields that contain rich galaxy clusters at @xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "the imacs f/2 spectra have an observed - frame resolution of 10  full - width - half - max with a typical s / n @xmath4 20 - 30 in the continuum per resolution element .",
    "spectral coverage varies , but almost all cover  and   emission , and   absorption , our optical diagnostics of star formation ; a fraction cover  as well . in each 28-diameter imacs field",
    "we have observed 65% of the galaxies that are brighter than @xmath9 , obtaining adequate spectra of 81% of these .",
    "measurement of spectral features followed procedures described in dressler ( 2004 , hereinafter d04 ) . for two fields we have confusion - limited spitzer multiband imaging photometer ( mips ) 4 m images ( guest observer program 40387 ) that cover nearly the entire imacs fields .",
    "details of the data , data reduction , and analysis of the field sample are described in oemler ( 2009b , hereinafter oem09b ) .    in the following analysis",
    "we include all galaxies between @xmath10 with absolute ab magnitudes at 4400   brighter than @xmath11 , except for those with redshifts within @xmath12 of each targeted cluster .",
    "@xmath13 has been determined to evolve with redshift as @xmath14 ( oem09b ) ; the limit of @xmath11 is about equivalent to @xmath15 at @xmath16 .",
    "there are 1144 objects in this sample .",
    "galaxies are given weights proportional to the inverse of the incompleteness of the data at each apparent magnitude . to provide a low  redshift point we use two samples of sdss galaxies with redshifts @xmath17 .",
    "to compare to infrared - derived properties of the icbs sample , we use a sample of 385 sdss galaxies within the swire fields ( lonsdale 2003 ) . for comparison with the optically - derived properties of our sample",
    ", we use this sdss / swire sample and add 690 sdss galaxies near the north galactic pole .",
    "we assume a concordance cosmology with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "for galaxies with spitzer - mips coverage we calculate sfrs in a way similar to prez - gonzlez ( 2006 ) , using the 4 m flux to estimate the absorbed uv flux and  to estimate the escaped uv flux , but including the k  corrections of rieke ( 2008 ) and a sfr scale based on a salpeter initial - mass - function ( imf , vid.oem09b ) .",
    "donley ( 2008 ) report that 1015% of 4 m sources at these flux densities are agn - dominated . given the strong redshift evolution of the agn luminosity function",
    ", the contamination in our @xmath21 sample should be should be considerably lower .",
    "figure 1 ( bottom panel ) shows the median sfr per unit @xmath22 , which we shall refer to as the specific sfr , as a function of redshift .",
    "we choose the _ median _ specific sfr over the more commonly reported _",
    "mean _ , because it is provides a more stable and typical value  particularly at higher redshifts , where the mean is dominated by a small number of very luminous objects .",
    "( in the @xmath23 interval , only 1.6% of the objects contribute 56% of the total star formation . )",
    "we also show , for comparison , values of the median @xmath24 , derived from the mid - ir data of damen ( 2009 ) , and from the prez - gonzlez ( 2008 ) study of the buildup of stellar mass ( from near - ir measurements ) , as reinterpreted by damen  and converted by us to a salpeter imf scale . to convert the damen  values of sfr per unit mass to @xmath24 we take a mean value of @xmath25 at 4400   of 3 , which is the ratio of the cosmic mass density ( prez - gonzlez , 2008 ) to the cosmic luminosity density ( blanton 2003 ) .",
    "although cosmic means , both are dominated by galaxies in the luminosity and mass ranges of our sample , and thus appropriate for our use . with @xmath26 , a sample with our absolute magnitude limit",
    "has a mean mass of @xmath27 .",
    "fig .  1 .  ( bottom )",
    "_ median _ specific sfr , in solar masses per year per l * luminosity .",
    "black filled circles show values for our sample derived from spitzer - mips 4 m fluxes .",
    "red stars are data from damen ( 2009 ) , and red open circles are data from prez - gonzlez ( 2008 ) as reinterpreted by damen ( 2009 ) .",
    "the median sfr appears to be declining more rapidly towards the present epoch .",
    "( top ) median values ( solid circles ) and 90th percentile values ( open circles ) of for the @xmath28 icbs field sample , binned to achieve comparable of numbers of -detected galaxies .",
    "the single point at @xmath29 comes sdss galaxies with optical spectroscopy ( see text ) .    at @xmath30",
    "the _ median _ values of sfr increase more slowly than the mean sfr , as reported by damen ( 2009 ) , martin ( 2007 ) , zheng ( 2007 ) , but are otherwise qualitatively similar .",
    "however , what has not been apparent from previous observations is that the fall of the median sfr appears to be accelerating in recent epochs .",
    "optical emission lines , , and  are less reliable sfr indicators than 4 m flux because of the very large and variable extinction which blankets the hii regions of starforming galaxies .",
    "however , they do provide at least a qualitative measure of current star formation and , unlike our spitzer - mips data , are available for all four icbs fields .",
    "therefore , we plot in the top panel of figure 1 the 50th and 90th percentiles of the distribution of _ equivalent width _ ew ( ) as a function of redshift .",
    "the shapes of these distributions are qualitatively similar to the infrared  derived sfr , however , strength increases more slowly with redshift because of the well - known effect that galaxies with higher sfrs also have higher dust extinction .",
    "it is now well established that starburst and post  starburst galaxies are abundant in intermediate  redshift clusters ( poggianti 1999 ( hereinafter p99 ) , oemler 2009a ) , however , less is known about the prevalence of starbursts among field galaxies at these epochs .",
    "starburst indicators include exceptionally strong balmer absorption , intense optical emission , and excess 4 m flux .",
    "strong balmer absorption in the integrated light of galaxies signals a rapid decline in the sfr , because light from a stars persists after the blue continuum from o and b stars , and the emission from hii regions  both of which dilute the balmer absorption lines  begin to fade or disappear altogether ( p99 ) .",
    "although strong balmer absorption accompanies even the simple truncation of star formation , as o and b stars and their hii regions evolve away , stellar @xmath32  occurs only in the aftermath of a significant rise in the sfr above its past average , i.e. , a burst ( dressler & gunn 1983 , couch & sharples 1987 , p99 ) . using this criterion ,",
    "p99 , d04 and oemler ( 2009a ) found that the sbf in the field at @xmath33 is lower than in clusters , but significantly higher than it is in the field today ; however , the data sets used were quite small .",
    "more recently , poggianti ( 2009 ) find a large incidence of dusty starburst galaxies for @xmath34 in all environments , but particularly in groups .",
    "using an entirely different approach , bell  ( 2005 ) find a substantial fraction of massive field galaxies at @xmath35 with sfrs much higher than their long  term averages . on the other hand , noeske ( 2007 ) argue that the narrow width of the sfr / mass versus mass relation among field galaxies in the groth strip of deep2 data is inconsistent with a large fraction of strong starbursts .    determining the starburst frequency  sbf",
    " as a function of cosmic epoch and environment is important both for understanding the nature and cause of starbursts , and their role in galaxy evolution .",
    "for example , starbursts provide a quick means of exhausting the gas supply in a galaxy .",
    "the dense environment of rich clusters provides a variety of mechanisms for producing starbursts , including ram - pressure from the intergalactic medium , tidal encounters between galaxies , and mergers and accretion .",
    "some of these are also viable in the group environment , to more or less effect , but ram pressure , for example , is likely to be unimportant . some present - epoch , truly isolated galaxies appear to have experienced starbursts as well , which might point to some instability in the disks of star forming galaxies , or accretion of a small satellite , as other possible causes .",
    "figure 2 compares results from two different methods of determining the sbf .",
    "the top panel shows the fraction of all galaxies in our field sample that have ew ( ) of 2.5  or greater than expected for a normal , non  bursting galaxy , following the method of d04 , but using an improved ew ( ) versus ew ( ) relation ( q.v .",
    "oem09 ) . following bell ( 2005 )",
    ", we also calculate the sbf from the spitzer  derived sfrs , by defining a starburst galaxy as one",
    "whose observed sfr is significantly higher than its long - term average rate , which should be , ignoring mass loss during stellar evolution ,    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the length of time that a galaxy has been forming stars , and @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath25 are , the galaxy s _ stellar mass _ , luminosity , and stellar mass  to  light ratio .",
    "we define @xmath37 to be time elasped from redshift @xmath40 ( a reasonable assumption for the start of star formation ) to the observed redshift , and assume that @xmath41 , where @xmath39 is calculated at 4400 .",
    "we identify a galaxy as a starburst if @xmath42 .",
    "we plot in figure 2 the fraction of galaxies which meet this criterion and perform the same analysis for the observations of noeske ( 2007 ) and bell ( 2005 ) . for these",
    "we include objects with @xmath43 , which for @xmath44 , is equivalent to our luminosity limit of @xmath11 .    fig .  2 .  two measures of starburst fraction , sbf , versus redshift for galaxies brighter than m*+1 .",
    "top : fraction of galaxies with excess ew ( ) @xmath45 2.5 ; bottom : fraction of galaxies with sfr @xmath46/@xmath47(universe ) .",
    "black filled circles  icbs data ; open red circles- data from noeske ( 2007 ) ; red filled circles  data from bell ( 2005 ) .",
    "black open circles are icbs data with sfr @xmath48/@xmath47(universe ) . using this criterion for a starburst ,",
    "all three samples give consistent results .",
    "figure 2 shows that such starbursts make up @xmath420 - 25% of starforming galaxies by @xmath49 , a much larger fraction than today , moreover , because the  duty cycle \" ( fraction of the time these galaxies are identifiable as starbursts ) is almost certainly less than 50% , the clear implication is that _ most starforming galaxies at @xmath50 have undergone a starburst of at least moderate strength .",
    "_ figure 2 also shows the sbf for a factor - of - ten increase rising in parallel .",
    "noeske ( 2007 ) emphasize the rarity of starbursts over a comparable ( but somewhat wider ) redshift range , basing their argument on the narrowness of the sfr / m versus m relation .",
    "they conclude that no more than one - third of typical starforming galaxies have sfr variations greater than a factor - of -two , while our sample suggests , after correction for the fraction of passive galaxies , that one - third have experienced a rise of a factor of three or more .",
    "put in these terms , the two results appear mildly inconsistent , however , as figure 2 illustrates , the noeske  data , when analyzed using the same method as we and bell ( 2005 ) have used , is in good agreement with our own .    finally , we show another way of assessing the sbf(z ) , using the composite spectra approach developed in d04 . here",
    "we add , weighted by luminosity , all icbs spectra in each of 5 redshift slices @xmath51 , and for a present - epoch sample of swire galaxies .",
    "we plot in figure 3 ew ( , ) measured from these composite spectra , along with expected values for a population of ( mostly ) continuously - starforming galaxies at the present epoch .",
    "figure 3 includes expected values calculated by d04 from the 2df & cnoc2 field surveys ( see d04 ) and also new determinations using the swire data , an improvement because we now have individual distributions ( on which these predictions rest ) from our icbs sample , for each redshift interval .",
    "the dressler - shectman low - redshift cluster and field samples follow the `` continuous star formation '' prediction , but the clusters at @xmath33 studied in the morphs collaboration depart , indicating a higher fraction of starbursts ( see d04 ) .",
    "3 .  versus equivalent widths for composite spectra , adapted from d04 .",
    "the lines ` 2df ' and ` cnoc2 ' show predictions for continuously starforming populations , and the points ` morphs ' and ` dressler - shectman ' cluster and field samples , from studies described in d04 .",
    "the low - redshift swire field galaxy sample is the blue point .",
    "the icbs field sample measurements are the 5 green points for redshift intervals centered at z = 0.25 , 0.35 , 0.45 , 0.55 , 0.65 .",
    "the 5 joined purple points show the prediction of ew ( , ) at these 5 redshift intervals for a population of present - epoch starforming galaxies ( the swire sample ) with very few starbursts , as described in the text .",
    "the observed icbs measurements at @xmath52 far exceed these predicted values , showing the substantial fraction of starburst galaxies in these field populations .",
    "the deep2 ( red ) point for field galaxies at @xmath53 extends and confirms this result .",
    "for the new field sample , figure 3 shows that the @xmath54 slices are little different from the present - epoch population , but the @xmath55 slices have much stronger absorption than expected for a population dominated by continuous star formation .",
    "we also can compare our ew ( , ) values to those from a composite spectrum of @xmath41000 field galaxies at @xmath56 from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey ( davis 2009 ) , this coadded spectrum was produced as described in weiner ( 2008 ) by jeff newmann and renbin yan from galaxies selected with limiting @xmath57 comparable to our own sample .",
    "the deep2 point continues the trend of yet greater sbf to even higher redshift , for a data set independent of our own , with higher s / n and higher spectral resolution .    in summary , methods based on ( 1 ) individual  strengths , ( 2 ) the sfr - increase - over - past - average , and ( 3 ) ( ew ( , ) from composite spectra , all point to an sbf that increases markedly with redshift .",
    "we have used optical spectra and mid - ir fluxes of field galaxies in our icbs galaxy cluster survey to measure the rapid decline of the specific star formation rate , sfr , since @xmath35 .",
    "although qualitatively consistent with other studies , we find that  parameterized as the median specific sfr  this decline appears to be steepening toward the present epoch .",
    "this might be evidence for a kind of  downsizing : \" elliptical / bulge formation dominates at @xmath58 and smoothly transitions to the building of massive galaxy disks , but as this wanes for @xmath59 , there is insufficient mass in the still - starforming dwarf galaxy population to prevent what is essentially the end of the era of star formation ( dressler 2004 ) .",
    "we also show that it is not just the sfr , but also its mode  the starburst fraction , sbf  that is evolving rapidly since @xmath60 .",
    "we use three different methods , from discrete and composite spectra , to show that the sbf also declines dramatically over this period .",
    "when accounting for the  duty cycle , \" the data suggest that the _ majority _ of starforming galaxies at @xmath61 followed this mode of star formation rather than in the steadier ,  continuous \" mode that dominates today .",
    "we emphasize that , unlike short and often - intense nuclear starbursts , these are typically of moderate strength  the sfr rising by a factor of 310 .",
    "they are likely to be galaxy - wide and of longer duration  consistent with the dynamical timescales of the larger region involved .",
    "it seems possible that these two effects  the rapid decline in specific sfr and the changing mode of star formation  share a common cause .",
    "availability of gas for star formation could be the principal agent .",
    "if the schmidt - kennicutt ( kennicutt 1998 ) law holds , higher sfrs of intermediate - redshift galaxies were due to gas fractions higher than the 20 - 40% typical of today s luminous spirals ( mccaugh & de blok 1997 ) , although how much greater may depend on the relative importance of @xmath62 versus @xmath63 ( robertson & kravtsov 2009 , krumholz 2009 ) .",
    "as discussed by putnam ( 2008 ) , this greater gas content could be due to initial supply , accretion of gas - rich satellites , or resupply from surrounding reservoirs of cooling gas , the latter the subject of much recent discussion ( see , e.g. , keres  2009 ) .",
    "however , direct measurements of gas contents for intermediate - redshift galaxies are not yet possible , and absorption measurements by prochaska and wolfe ( 2009 )  albeit of hi alone  support a different picture in which gas fractions do not evolve strongly and high sfrs are instead supported by high rates of gas accretion .    if higher sfrs were the result of higher gas fractions of more than 50% for typical @xmath64 galaxies , then it is reasonable to suppose that the higher sbf might also be a result .",
    "star formation in gas - rich disks may be unstable if high supernovae rates heat disks sufficiently to disrupt conditions favorable for star formation .",
    "after a gas - cooling time of several hundred million years , rapid star formation could return ; color - magnitude diagrams for some nearby dwarf galaxies show two or more episodes of star formation separated by billions of years ( e.g , gallart 1999 ; held 2000 ) .",
    "if resupply by cold gas flows is important to the evolution of spiral disks , the higher infall rates of earlier epochs could be subject to significant variability , simply a result of the granularity of the gas density in a complex network of filaments .    finally , mergers of gas - rich galaxies might contribute to the rising sbf with increasing redshift , although bell ( 2005 ) find only a small fraction of their high sfr galaxies at @xmath65 in major mergers .",
    "perhaps a higher rate of accretion of small satellites at earlier times might have resulted in more starbursts .",
    "indeed , since these smaller systems were probably gas rich , accretion rather than major mergers might be the dominant starburst trigger .",
    "as yet there are no direct means to measure gas fractions in @xmath66 galaxies , but alma and the proposed ska will in future provide that capability . until that time",
    ", there is an important role for numerical modeling , with its increasing resolution , to explore whether gas fractions , inflow rates , and satellite accretion would affect not just the rate of star formation but its mode as well .",
