    "the design of the irs was driven by the objective of maximizing sensitivity given the 85 cm aperture of the spitzer space telescope @xcite and the then - available detectors .",
    "dividing the optical trains of the irs into four separate spectrographs substantially reduced the complexity and overall cost of the system .",
    "the result is four separate modules , known by their wavelength coverage and resolution as short - low ( sl ) , short - high ( sh ) , long - low ( ll ) , and long - high ( lh ) .",
    "the slit widths are set to @xmath2/85 cm , where @xmath3 is the _",
    "wavelength for the module .",
    "further in the geometric limit the monochromatic slit image covers two pixels .",
    "two si : as detectors , 128@xmath4128 pixels in size , collect the light in the sl and sh modules , while two si : sb detectors of the same number of pixels are used in the ll and lh modules .",
    "in addition to its spectrographs , the irs contains two peak - up imaging fields , which are built into the short - low module , and have bandpasses centered at 16  ( `` blue '' ) and 22  ( `` red '' ) .",
    "a picture of irs is presented in figure 1 , and table 1 gives the parameters of each module .",
    "the two long - slit low - resolution modules were designed for optimum sensitivity to dust features in the local and distant universe and are effectively limited in sensitivity by the zodiacal and/or galactic backgrounds .",
    "the two cross - dispersed high - resolution echelle modules were designed to achieve the highest possible resolution for the given array dimensions , and they were optimized for sensitivity to emission lines .",

    "the spitzer observer s manual ( som ) provides a more thorough discussion , and it is updated frequently .",
    "the irs contains no moving parts .",
    "the diamond - machined optics are bolted directly to the precision - machined module housings , and all are constructed of aluminum so that the assembled modules retain their focus and alignment from room temperature to their operating temperature near 1.8 k without any further adjustment .",
    "the focal plane assemblies are equipped with custom plates to interface with the module housing and account for the individual dimensions and locations of the arrays .",
    "each module contains two flood - illuminating stimulators to monitor the performance of the arrays .",
    "the low - resolution modules each contain two sub - slits , one for the first - order spectrum and one for the second - order spectrum .",
    "when a source is in the sub - slit for the second order , a short piece of the first order appears on the array ; this `` bonus '' order improves the overlap between the first and second orders .",
    "the high - resolution modules are cross dispersed so that ten orders ( 1120 ) fall on the array .",
    "the modules were extensively tested at operating temperature at ball aerospace @xcite .",
    "light from external sources passed through the dewar window and a series of neutral density filters at liquid n@xmath6 and he temperatures .",
    "an external optical system projected both point and extended images from either a blackbody or a monochromator onto each slit or sub - slit .",
    "these tests verified the resolution , internal focus and alignment as well as the correct centering of the spectrum on the arrays . from the beginning of testing through integration and launch , the",
    "focus and alignment of the modules has remained constant on a scale of a tenth of a pixel .",
    "the monochromator tests allowed us to map the wavelength positions roughly on the arrays in preparation for flight .",
    "uncertainties in the transmission of the neutral - density filter stacks prevented a useful determination of the overall sensitivities prior to launch .",
    "instead , the sensitivities of the modules were predicted by an analytic model of the system .",
    "extensive observations using a prototype of the short - high module at the hale 5 m telescope verified the procedures used in the sensitivity predictions to the 20% level @xcite .",
    "when the irs is operating , all four of its detector arrays are clocked simultaneously , but it is only possible to capture data from one array at a time .",
    "two techniques are used in data collection , the double correlated sampling ( dcs mode ) and raw data collection ( raw mode , or `` sample up the ramp '' ) .",
    "science data are collected in raw mode while peak - up employs dcs . in dcs mode following an initial series of bias boost and reset frames ,",
    "each pixel is sampled , and then after a number of non - destructive spins through the array each pixel is sampled again via a destructive read and the difference between the two samples is stored as an 128@xmath4128 pixel image . in the raw mode after the same initial bias boost , reset frames and first sampling of pixels there are a number of spin frames followed by a non - destructive read .",
    "this pattern is repeated @xmath7 times .",
    "when all pixels are sampled again the result is a 128@xmath4128@xmath8 cube , where @xmath7 is the number of non - destructive reads , and the values are @xmath7=4 , 8 , or 16 .",
    "a final 128@xmath4128 image is created by calculating the signal slope of each pixel of the raw cube .",
    "mapping the relative positions of each field of view and the spacecraft s pointing calibration reference sensor ( pcrs ) was the most critical step of the in - orbit checkout ( ioc ) phase .",
    "the positions must be measured to an accuracy of better than 0@xmath914 radial ( 0@xmath928 for the long - wavelength modules ) to meet the 5% radiometric requirements .",
    "the positions were measured iteratively , starting with ground - based estimates and proceeding successively through ultra - coarse , coarse , and fine focal - plane surveys . combined with the determination of the focus between the telescope and the slits , this process took place over nearly six of the eight weeks of the ioc period .",
    "the estimated uncertainties in the final measured positions of the slits and the peak - up arrays are better than the requirements in all cases , ranging from 0@xmath909 to 0@xmath912 .",
    "our knowledge of the internal focus and optical calibration of the spectral orders were updated in - flight using a combination of photometric standard stars and emission line objects .",
    "the widths of the orders were derived from the zodiacal light at maximum intensity , while order curvatures , tilts , and wavelength solutions were re - derived from spectral maps of emission line stars such as p cygni and planetary nebulae such as ngc 6543 , ngc 7027 , and smp 083 .",
    "figure 2 presents the hydrogen recombination spectrum of the be star @xmath10 cas , which provides a good check of the wavelength calibration for short - high .",
    "flatfielding and spectrophotometric calibration are determined from mapping and staring observations of well known standards , including @xmath11 dra ( hr 6688 , k2 iii ) , hr 7310 ( g9 iii ) and hr 6606 ( g9 iii ) .",
    "calibration of the low - resolution modules also used fainter standards ( e.g. hd 42525 , a0 v ) . @xcite",
    "provide more details about the calibration scheme . @xcite",
    "discuss the stars and synthetic spectra used for in - flight spectrophotometric calibration .",
    "we are also verifying the calibration using spectral templates generated as described by @xcite and observations of additional standard stars .    the overlaps in wavelength coverage between the various modules and in orders within each module aid the internal cross - calibration of the irs .",
    "these overlaps were also used to search for leaks in the order - sorting filters by observing `` cold '' and `` hot '' sources in two overlapping orders . in the case of the first - order filter for long - low ( ll1 ) , which had partially delaminated prior to launch",
    ", we used the combination of uranus and neptune as the cold sources and spectrophotometric standard stars as the hot sources . at this time the analysis limits any possible filter leak in ll1 to a maximum of @xmath55% for a rayleigh - jeans spectrum .",
    "further on - going efforts will refine this limit .",
    "the third largest solar proton flare in the past 25 years began on 2003 october 28 , resulting in an integrated proton flux through the arrays of 1.9@xmath410@xmath12 protons @xmath13 , equivalent to the 50 percentile dose expected during the first 2.6 years of the mission .",
    "as a result , the sensitivity of @xmath54% of the pixels in long - high and @xmath51% of the pixels in the other modules have been degraded .",
    "the degree of damage is consistent with the pre - launch damage experienced by non - flight arrays that were exposed to a beam of 40 mev protons at the harvard cyclotron facility .",
    "the irs is more sensitive to damage than the other science instruments on board spitzer because it is operating at lower background conditions where even a small increase in dark current has a significant effect .",
    "the measured responsitivity of the system in flight was on average two times better than the pre - launch model prediction .",
    "the detector noise measured in the unilluminated parts of the arrays are the same as measured pre - launch .",
    "therefore , potentially in the limit of small signals the sensitivity is on average two times better than the model predictions .",
    "most of this increase is due to design margin , an assumed factor to account of errors and non - modeled effects .",
    "the assumed margins were a factor of @xmath14 for the short wavelength modules and a factor of 2 for the long wavelength modules .",
    "updated estimates of sensitivity are available in the current version of the som .",
    "the ssc provides a sensitivity calculator for the irs known as spec - pet that includes detector noise , source shot noise , and background shot noise . at the current time",
    "the sensitivity is limited by systematic effects , such as noise from the flatfield , fringing , and/or extraction edge effects , which are not included in the calculations of spec - pet .",
    "the observed sensitivities are approximately three times worse than would be achieved by the above responsivities and detector noise .",
    "it is anticipated that the realized sensitivities will improve as the system calibration improves .",
    "the irs currently has two modes of operation , the spectral `` staring '' and `` mapping '' modes . in both cases the target",
    "is acquired and then observed in a fixed sequence starting with sl2 ( short - low second - order ) , sl1 , sh , ll2 , ll1 , lh , skipping any unrequested slits .    the target acquisition method is selected by the observer .",
    "one may simply rely on the blind telescope pointing to point the slits to the specified position on the sky .",
    "a second option is to use the pcrs @xcite to calculate the centroid of a reference star , use the offset between the star and the science target and move the science target into the slit .",
    "a third and more accurate option is to use the irs peak - up cameras to centroid on a 16 or 22@xmath15 m image of the science target or a reference star before commencing the requested spectroscopic observations ( see  4.2 ) . using the the pcrs or irs peak - up on a reference star requires accurate coordinates for both the offset star and the science target .",
    "the irs staring is the more basic mode of operation , and it results in observing the target at the 1/3 and 2/3 positions along the slit ( its two nod positions ) , each with the integration time specified for that slit .",
    "the mapping mode steps the slit parallel and/or perpendicular to the slit according to the number and the size of the steps specified by the observer for each slit .",
    "the mapping mode does not perform the 1/3 and 2/3 nod observations that are automatically done in the staring mode .",
    "both the staring and mapping modes accept multiple target / position inputs , as long as all of the positions are within a region two - degree radius in the sky .",
    "multiple targets are specified in a `` cluster '' list by either their 1 ) absolute positions , 2 ) right ascension and declination offsets or 3 ) parallel / perpendicular slit offsets with respect to an absolute fiducial position . if using irs in spectral mapping mode with cluster inputs , parallel / perpendicular slit offsets can not be used .",
    "if the cluster specification is selected , all sources / offsets in the cluster are observed with the same slit before proceeding to the next slit . use of the cluster specification , as opposed to repeating the same observation one source at a time , reduces the observatory overhead and can lead to substantial savings in total `` wall clock '' time .",
    "the som describes the irs observing modes and the various methods of target acquisition in more detail . in the sections below , we concentrate on using the irs peak - up cameras to place a target in the desired slit , and describe how an observer can use the peak - up fields for imaging at 16 and 22 .",
    "the irs sl module contains two peak - up imaging fields .",
    "their field of view is @xmath16 , with a scale of 18 per pixel , and their bandpasses are centered at 16  and 22  for the `` blue '' and `` red '' camera respectively ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the irs peak - up mode enables the placement of a source on a spectrographic slit or series of slits more accurately than just using blind pointing of the spacecraft alone .",
    "the telescope blind pointing has a positional accuracy of @xmath17 ( 1@xmath18 rms radial ) .",
    "an on - board algorithm determines the centroid of the brightest source in the specified peak - up field and communicates the offsets required to accurately position the target in the requested slit to the spacecraft . as long as the coordinates of a target are accurate enough to place it on the peak - up imaging field and it is the brightest object in the field",
    ", the irs will accurately offset to the selected slits .",
    "the peak - up images are supplied to the observers and can also be used scientifically if desired .",
    "the allowed ranges of flux densities for blue and red peak - up point sources are f@xmath19=0.8150mjy and f@xmath20=1.4340mjy , respectively .",
    "however , to avoid excessive integration times and a higher probability of failure , we recommend a flux of at least 2mjy for the blue and 5mjy for the red .",
    "the irs peak - up algorithm has been optimized for point sources ( and indeed this mode has been the most extensively tested and verified in - orbit ) , but an `` extended source '' mode is available for sources with diameters between 5@xmath21 and 20@xmath21 ( e.g. comets ) .",
    "the allowed flux density range for extended sources , for either the blue or red mode , is f@xmath22=15340mjysr@xmath23 .",
    "the observer can specify two peak - up accuracies : `` high '' and `` medium '' . in the simplest case , when peaking up on the science target itself , the first move to a slit after peak - up insures placement to within 0@xmath94 ( 1@xmath18 rms radial ) of the slit center for high accuracy and 1@xmath90 for medium accuracy .",
    "the high accuracy value is driven by the 5% radiometric accuracy requirement for the short - high slit ( 4@xmath97 width ) .",
    "the irs section of the som provides details on how these accuracy options apply to multiple slit positioning after peak - up ( e.g. , for targets in irs cluster mode ) .    in the event that the science target can not also serve as the peak - up target ( e.g. if its flux is too low or too high ) , the `` offset peak - up '' mode gives the option of peaking - up using a nearby source .",
    "the observer is free to use any suitable source within 30@xmath24 of the science target , but the spitzer planning tool ( spot ) also provides a list of recommended candidates . note that this mode requires accurate coordinates for both the offset and science target .",
    "an irs peak - up returns the image of the peak - up target .",
    "the pcrs extends the irs peak - up capability to optical point sources with visual magnitudes ranging between @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the only mode for pcrs currently available provides pointing equivalent to the high accuracy mode of the irs .",
    "the pcrs peak - up does not produce or return an image .",
    "the peak - up fields in the short - low module provide a means of obtaining images at 16 and 22  ( 5.4 and 7.5  fwhm respectively ) . the 16  window in particular",
    "is interesting because the other cameras on spitzer do not cover this wavelength region , and because this wavelength region was used by the _ infrared space observatory _",
    "( _ iso _ ) for most of its deep extragalactic surveys .",
    "since these surveys probed the properties of galactic evolution only up to @xmath27 , irs can provide the link between these past results and the new discoveries which will be made by spitzer at @xmath28 .",
    "imaging with the irs peak - up cameras has not been fully supported for the first year of operations , but the ssc will provide the ability to obtain large mosaics in a manner similar to irac @xcite before the end of 2005 .",
    "however , an interim method called cheap ( cornell high - efficiency advanced peak - up ) has been used extensively to obtain mid - infrared images .",
    "cheap is based on an irs short - low staring observation and uses our knowledge of the offsets between the center of the peak - up windows and the short - low slits in spacecraft coordinates , along with the standard two - position nodding along the slit , to place a source target in various positions on the two peak - up windows .",
    "the user may select any combination of exposure times and cycles of the short - low to obtain an image .",
    "the data are processed by the standard ssc pipeline as though they are standard short - low spectroscopic observations .",
    "the software that combines and calibrates the produced images is already available .    as an example , taking a cheap image using a standard 60sec short - low staring exposure will produce two images at 16 and 22  with an rms noise of @xmath29 in only @xmath5720 sec of total time .",
    "it is interesting to note that the rms noise of the _ iso _   observations of the hubble deep field ( hdf ) was just @xmath30 at 15  and that the faintest source detected in the hdf at 15  was 50% brighter than the sensitivity in the above example @xcite .",
    "the use of cheap to obtain 16 and 22@xmath15 m images of a sample of high redshift ( @xmath311.5 ) submillimeter galaxies is presented by @xcite and the first 16@xmath15 m imaging of a lyman break galaxy at @xmath32=2.79 is discussed by @xcite .",
    "a number of issues should be considered in the design of spectroscopic observations using irs .",
    "these are addressed in detail in the som , but we briefly mention a few of the more important ones in this section .",
    "although the infrared background is fainter than the ground based background by a factor of 10@xmath33 , it may still be necessary to take an `` off source '' measurement of the background .",
    "the low resolution modules do this automatically in the sense that both sub - slits are exposed at the same time so the spectrum from the `` off '' slit can be subtracted from the `` on '' slit to remove the background .",
    "alternately , the low - resolution slits are long enough to do the background subtraction on the slit itself . however , the high - resolution slits are too short to subtract the background by differencing the nod positions .",
    "if the continuum level is important , off source integrations using the same module are required for the purpose of background subtraction .",
    "spot provides an estimate of the background that is helpful in planning for background subtraction . as a general rule",
    ", the observers should use the low - resolution modules to measure continuum and broadband features , and the high - resolution modules to measure unresolved lines .",
    "the peak - up system works extremely well over its range of parameters .",
    "however , the observer needs to carefully check that the flux of the peak - up candidate falls within the specified limits of the cameras and correctly enter it into spot .",
    "furthermore , as already mentioned in section 4.2 the candidate must be the brightest object within @xmath5120@xmath34 , to ensure that it will be the one selected by the peak - up algorithm .",
    "there have been several peak - up failures due to violations of one or the other of above the requirements .",
    "observing with spitzer is unlike most ground based infrared observing . on the ground",
    "the background signal overwhelms the source by many orders of magnitude .",
    "therefore , the system noise is set by the shot noise from the background . on spitzer , the noise ( n )",
    "is dominated by detector noise for small signals ( s ) , so n@xmath5constant . however , as the signal level increases the shot noise in the signal eventually dominates : n@xmath35s@xmath36 . at the highest signal levels fixed pattern noise ( flat fielding errors , etc . )",
    "are dominant and consequently n@xmath35s . at the present time",
    "it appears that the flat fielding term is 1 to 2% , effectively limiting the maximum s / n ratio to @xmath550 to 100 .",
    "similarly at very low signals the flatfield uncertainty limits our 1@xmath18 detection to @xmath50.3mjy at 16@xmath15 m for low backgrounds ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the online s /",
    "n estimator includes all but this last term .",
    "as described in detail in the som , irs observations , either in dcs or raw mode , are stored as fits files of what is called a data collection event ( dce ) .",
    "a dce contains all the data obtained by an irs module since the most recent destructive read .",
    "the irs science pipeline at the ssc treats each dce independently .",
    "the processing of dcs data , such as those collected during an irs peak - up , by the pipeline is minimal and all processing is performed on - board the spacecraft .",
    "however , for data obtained in raw mode the pipeline removes basic instrumental signatures and corrects for variations in spectral response within and between spectral orders . a number of these steps , such as corrections / checks for saturation , cosmic rays , dark current subtraction as well as linearization are performed in the cube level prior to fitting a slope to the sampled up the detector charge integration ramp .",
    "others , such as correction for drifts in the dark current , and stray light or crosstalk between the orders are applied once the slope image has been created .",
    "the irs array data supplied in fits files to the observer are organized into four categories : engineering pipeline data , basic calibrated data ( bcd ) , browse - quality data ( bqd ) , and calibration data .",
    "additional files are also available of the masks used in the pipeline processing as well as processing log and quality assurance files .",
    "the engineering pipeline data consist of the raw detector sample images , with some descriptive information in the fits file headers .",
    "the bcd files are the fundamental basis for science analysis , with the primary product being a two - dimensional slope image of each dce in units of electrons sec@xmath23 pixel@xmath23 , accompanied by a header containing the essential programmatic information and the processing , calibration , and pointing history .",
    "additional bcd data files include uncertainty images that accompany each slope image and various intermediate images that do not have all of the pipeline processing corrections applied .",
    "the bcd also include coadded image data for those observations with more than one ramp at a sky location .",
    "it is expected that the bcd files will be used by the irs observers as the standard data input for subsequent publishable science data analysis . as an example , in a standard irs staring observation in which the observer has requested 3 cycles of 30sec integrations on a science target with the sh module will result in 6 dces in raw mode .",
    "the engineering data pipeline will process the data , which will have the form of six data cubes ( 3 integration cycles at each of the two nod positions along the slit ) , each 128@xmath4128 pixels @xmath4 16 detector reads in size . the bcd pipeline will produce six 128x128 bcd slope images as well as two 128@xmath4128 co - added slope images .",
    "the calibration data include measurements of standard calibration objects and can be used with the bcd to further refine the quality of the science data .",
    "the bqd is designed to provide the observer with an early look at spectra extracted from 2-dimensional bcd images of point sources . in general , the bqd spectra are designed to convey the richness of the observed data and in some cases may be of publishable quality . to extract spectra from each individual bcd image the",
    "post - bcd pipeline first applies a search algorithm to trace the spectrum in the two dimensional 128@xmath4128 pixel images .",
    "extraction is performed using an aperture that follows the linear expansion of the point spread function ( psf ) with wavelength .",
    "all spectra are extracted as point sources and no sky background is subtracted before the extraction is made ( see discussion in  4.1 on how this may affect the extracted spectrum ) .",
    "the spectra are then photometrically calibrated ( in janskys ) to remove the effects of truncation of the psf by the slit aperture and high - order systematic residuals from flatfielding .",
    "most pipeline operations are now routine , but the need to characterize the performance of the instrument in - orbit has led to numerous modifications to the algorithms and adjustments to parameters .",
    "most important are ongoing efforts to refine the detection and mitigation of latencies and cosmic ray hits , correct for stray light between the echelle orders , and remove stray light in short - low module originating from the peak - up apertures .",
    "extraction methods and the final spectrophotometric calibration of the spectra are also very sensitive to the pixelation of psf at each wavelength , and as a result both the extraction and calibration will require some fine - tuning as a result of what has been learned from in - flight measurements",
    ". a detailed user s guide to the ssc pipeline and its products is in preparation .",
    "the irs spectroscopy modeling , analysis and reduction tool ( smart ) is an idl software package used to reduce and analyze irs data from the four modules and the two peak - up arrays .",
    "smart is designed to operate on the basic calibration data ( bcd ) delivered by the ssc pipeline and can be run both interactively and in batch mode .",
    "it provides a suite of quick - look routines that enable observers to assess the quality of their data .",
    "smart extracts spectra from either individual or coadded bcds , and these can be weighted by a pixel mask which characterizes the noise in the data .",
    "the extraction routines include column extraction of a point source scaled to the instrumental psf , fixed - aperture extraction for extended sources and a weighted gaussian extraction for point sources .",
    "several options are available to optimize the sky subtraction .",
    "the spectra from the individual modules can be combined to produce a single spectrum from 538 .",
    "spectral analysis , including line , black - body , template and zodiacal light fitting , photometry , defringing and dereddening are also available .",
    "the spectral analysis package is based on the _ iso _  spectral analysis package ( isap , * ? ? ?",
    "smart includes packages developed by the spitzer legacy teams .",
    "the c2d team provided a number of defringing tools while the feps team has contributed idp3 , an image analysis software package originally developed for the nicmos instrument of the hubble space telescope .",
    "@xcite provide more details about the smart package .",
    "it will become publically available in 2004 september .",
    "the articles in this special spitzer issue provide many examples of the quality of the spectra from the irs .",
    "in addition to the spectrum of @xmath10 cas in figure 2 , we show examples of one low - resolution spectrum and one high - resolution spectrum , both of galaxies .",
    "all data presented have been processed and extracted from individual dces using the irs pipeline at the ssc .",
    "figure 3 presents a spectrum of ngc 7714 using short - high and long - high ( 240 seconds integration each ) .",
    "@xcite describe this spectrum in more detail , but one can immediately note the many forbidden lines and dust features present .",
    "figure 4 presents the spectrum of ugc 5101 obtained using the low - resolution modules .",
    "the integration times were 12 seconds in each short - low sub - slit and 28 seconds in each long - low sub - slit , and this was sufficient to show a rich spectrum with gas , dust , and ice features .",
    "see @xcite for more information on this spectrum .",
    "the irs is a major step forward in speed and sensitivity .",
    "it clearly enables the extension of infrared spectroscopy to a very large number of extragalactic sources . the designed spectral resolution is well matched to the expected line widths from these objects .",
    "the irs also allows mid - infrared spectroscopy of objects such as brown dwarfs , individual stars in neighboring galaxies , and a wide variety of other sources previously difficult or impossible to study spectroscopically in the mid - infrared .",
    "this description of the irs gives the potential observer a brief review of its design , its capabilities , and how to use it .",
    "now it is up to the astronomical community to fully exploit what the irs can do .",
    "the design , fabrication , and testing of the irs at ball aerospace corporation was supported by a nasa contract awarded by the jet propulsion laboratory to cornell university ( jpl contract number 960803 ) .",
