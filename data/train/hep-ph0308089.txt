    "this paper is a theoretical study of multiplicity signatures in coherent production of charged - pairs of parabosons [ 1 - 3 ] of order @xmath0 in comparison with those arising in the case of ordinary bosons , @xmath1 .",
    "the investigation is partially motivated by phenomenological coherence analyses , circa 1970 , of inelastic @xmath12 pair production from fixed targets with laboratory kinetic - energies up to 27 gev by c.p . wang [ 4 ] , and by horn and silver[5 ] .",
    "the present analysis is possible because the conserved - charge boson coherent states of [ 5 , 6 ] are analogous to ones recently constructed for order @xmath0 parabosons [ 7 ] .",
    "one physical consequence of  order @xmath0 \" is that two or less such bosons can occupy a totally anti - symmetric state . appendix 1 contains a brief review of @xmath0 paraboson statistics .",
    "both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 models considered in this paper are notably `` statistical '' and crudely `` unrealistic '' in being free of kinematic and dynamical parameters associated with physically important production quantities such as the distributions of available energy / momentum , the kinematic size and other characteristics of the production region , resonances , masses and other conserved quantum numbers ( e.g. isotopic spin in the @xmath1 case [ 8 ] ) , because only the @xmath13-charge conservation constraint has been imposed . consequently , unlike what some readers would expect the situation to be from consideration of other particle - production models , in the figures the relative sizes of different aspects of the peaks , and of other structures , of the surfaces / curves can not be adjusted without additional assumptions and complications .",
    "so despite the authors efforts , an interested viewer must sometimes force oneself to `` look '' in examination of some aspects of the figures . in the @xmath1 case ,",
    "more realistic models / arguments were made [ 8 ] to investigate such issues as independent - emission and coherence in @xmath14 pair production but these analyses are by now , of course , extremely primitive versus the current very sophisticated computational treatments [ 9 , 10 ] of multi - particle production in high - energy collisions .",
    "for instance , even in electron - positron collisions a wide variety of coherence phenomena such as stage - one and stage - two spin - correlations in fermion - antifermion pair production , bose - einstein interference effects , and color - reconnection effects are used in various computational frameworks to describe and investigate particle production at lep . despite the lack of inclusion of other physics that would be required in a realistic application",
    ", we think that the focus in this paper on a comparison of these parameter - free statistical models is interesting and instructive with respect to @xmath0 versus @xmath1 parastatistics , and to the associated coherences involved in the production of conserved - charge paraboson pairs .    from the then available data , in [ 4 ]",
    "wang reported a regularity when , for various laboratory kinetic energies of the incoming primary particle , the relative frequency of events @xmath15 was plotted against the mean multiplicty @xmath10 for charged @xmath12 pairs for @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 collisions .",
    "the data set was a compilation of about 50 inelastic production experiments with incoming primary kinetic energies extending from below production threshold to @xmath21 .",
    "wang tried to fit the regularity with two poisson - type distributions . in [ 5 ] , horn and silver constructed instead a simple parameter - free statistical model and found that , ignoring fluctuations in the data due to the specific structure of the various channels , the model did agree [ 5 , 7 ] with the universal trends of the experimental regularity reported by wang .",
    "one construction of the horn - silver model is / was from the @xmath1 conserved - charge coherent states .",
    "versus the inelastic reactions multiplicity data , in [ 5 ] horn and silver argued for a statistical treatment of the gross features because ( i ) momentum conservation should be a weak constraint since the emitted pions occupy a small part of the available phase space , ( ii ) total isospin conservation on the distribution of charged pions should also be weak since neutral pions are summed over , and so ( iii ) charge conservation remains as the important constraint .",
    "they derived the @xmath15 distribution discussed below .",
    "their @xmath22 distribution , i.e. the percentage of events with ",
    "m \" @xmath14 pairs and no extra @xmath23 s , had been considered earlier by kastrup [ 11 ] .    at the present time , the only way known to construct the analogous model in the @xmath0 case is to use conserved - charge coherent states . an alternative formulation with respect to either the statistical aspects or the coherence aspects is not currently available .",
    "so we now briefly digress to discuss what are these conserved - charge coherent states and then compare them with their @xmath1 counterpart :    a charged - paraboson pair in order @xmath0 consists of one a quanta of charge ` + 1 ' and one b quanta of charge ` -1 ' .",
    "the hermitian charge operator is defined by @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the parabose number operators , see appendix 1 .",
    "although @xmath26 does not commute with @xmath27 or @xmath28 , and although the paraboson pair operators @xmath29 , since @xmath30=0,\\quad \\lbrack q , ba]=0,\\quad \\lbrack ab , ba]=0\\ ] ] the @xmath0 coherent state can be defined as simultaneous eigenstate of @xmath31 and @xmath3 : @xmath32 note that unlike in the @xmath1 case ( see below ) , here two complex numbers @xmath33 and @xmath34 arise because @xmath2 and @xmath3 are fundamentally distinct operators .",
    "consequently , in the following multiplicity considerations , two non - negative parameters occur which are the moduli of these two complex numbers , @xmath35 and @xmath36 which involve the modified bessel functions @xmath37}(u)$ ] and @xmath38}(v)$ ] are given in [ 7 ] for @xmath39 and @xmath40 ; note @xmath41=$ ] `` integer part of @xmath42 '' . for @xmath43 ,",
    "the @xmath44th - moment of the mean multiplicity for a @xmath0 charged - paraboson  pair is @xmath45 . for @xmath9",
    "fixed , the percentage of events with @xmath8 such pairs , @xmath15 , is the square of the moduli of the expansion coefficients of @xmath46 in terms of the two - mode parabose number fock states ( see [ 7 ] ) .",
    "the explicit multiplicity formulas corresponding to the figures shown in this paper can be found below in section 2 .",
    "the simpler @xmath1 conserved - charge coherent state @xmath47 satisfies @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "since @xmath2 = @xmath3 for @xmath1 , @xmath50 involves a single complex number @xmath51 , and so the horn - silver multiplicity analysis involved a single , non - negative real parameter latexmath:[$x\\equiv     because the @xmath0 construction involves two non - negative real parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 , we consider a 3d plot of @xmath55 versus the quarter plane defined by @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "this is the obvious generalization of wang s plot and it is the focus of section 2 and its figures .",
    "section 3 contains some additional multiplicity formulas which are similar in structure for @xmath58 .",
    "section 4 contains a brief discussion of some of what has / hasnt been learned from this analysis of coherent production of charged - pairs of parabosons of order @xmath0 .",
    "appendix 2 and its figures are focused on how different shaped @xmath59 charts , or coordinate patches , appear when mapped onto the two - dimensional surface .",
    "the analysis in this section is straight - forward because there are simple explicit mathematical formulas involving modified bessel functions and because  mathematica \" [ 12 ] notebooks are convenient for displaying the parametric 1-parameter @xmath1  curve \" and 2-parameter @xmath60  varying - width , folded ribbon . \"",
    "we find that a concise  curve / ribbon \" terminology is useful and appropriate for describing , for example , figs .",
    "1a , b , which are for @xmath61 , and @xmath62 . on a 2d side of the 3d display ,",
    "the @xmath60 ribbon consequently appears projected as a relatively narrow , two - dimensional region which will be denoted as a  band \" ; see fig .",
    "1b which shows the front xz side of fig .",
    "1a . in spite of their being from the more complex @xmath63 asymmetric case ,",
    "these two lead figures have been chosen in order to _ ab initio _ discuss some details and caveats .    if the reader initially finds figs .",
    "1a , b and their description too complex , the reader might go directly to figs . 2 and 3a , b which are for the simpler @xmath64 symmetric case .",
    "1a , b , and in the remaining figures in this paper , the solid line is the @xmath1 curve . in these two figures , this @xmath1 curve is also the @xmath65 line on the @xmath60 ribbon . near the peak ,",
    "the  fold \" is the bottom edge of the ribbon .",
    "as shown , the @xmath60 ribbon consists of open - circles for the non - folded @xmath66 region , and of solid - circles for the folded @xmath67 region .",
    "the upper edge of the ribbon is the @xmath68 set of points .",
    "slightly to the right of the peak , one can see from the solid - circles that each line of dots traveling leftward down the page , bends under ( or  over \" , whichever as the viewer prefers ) the fold to reach the @xmath65 line on the ribbon .    for @xmath9 odd , we assume it is a  complete fold \" . the words",
    " complete fold \" mean that one part of the @xmath69 ribbon lies exactly on top of another part , and so there is no difference in going  under \" or  over \" such a fold .",
    "due to the very limited analytic results , mental / visual care is generally advisable : ( i ) only for the cases of @xmath70 and for @xmath62 is it proven that the @xmath1 curve always lies on the @xmath0 two dimensional surface . in these two cases",
    "the proof appears un - instructive for then the parametric - solution @xmath71 ( and for @xmath70 also @xmath72 ) avoids confronting different ratios of modified bessel functions . for an arbitrary @xmath9 value , from the asymptotic limits for the modified bessel functions",
    ", it follows that as @xmath73 , the curve and as @xmath74 , the ribbon must begin at the same point : the origin for @xmath75 and @xmath76 for @xmath77 .",
    "similarly , for large parameters for arbitrary @xmath9 , the curve and ribbon will also be at the same 3d point with @xmath78 , if @xmath79 .",
    "( ii ) only for @xmath9 even is it known that there is a complete fold of the ribbon because then @xmath6 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are each @xmath64 symmetric . for @xmath9",
    "even , the fold is the line @xmath80 , c.f . the simpler figs . 2 and 3a , b .",

    "8a , b .",
    "second , the reader should be aware that the  dots \" displayed to show the two - dimensional surface correspond to specific @xmath82 parameter values and that the associated @xmath83 , @xmath84 values are equally spaced , c.f .",
    "5a below where some @xmath81 coordinate values are shown . in some figures",
    ", @xmath85 is not equal to @xmath86 .",
    "we find that a careful usage of a few un - connected  dots \" does not mislead in displaying these two - dimensional surfaces .",
    "the  dots \" should not be confused with a random generation of data points , such as in a scatter plot .",
    "note that the @xmath53 and @xmath54 parameters do not map into an orthogonal coordinate chart on the ribbon .",
    "in general , at each point on the ribbon the curvature is non - zero .",
    "third , in consideration of figs .",
    "1a , b , as well as the other figures in this paper , it should be noted that , even near the peak , the width of the ribbon is narrow versus , for instance , the half - width of the @xmath1 peak .",
    "this fact , besides the folding and the role of the @xmath53 and @xmath54 parameters , would be an important issue in attempting empirically to distinguish coherent production pairs of @xmath0 parabosons versus those of ordinary @xmath1 bosons .",
    "on the other hand , the ribbon width is indeed non - zero and to the eye there is generally a systematic above , or below , displacement of the visual center of the @xmath0  band \" from the @xmath1 curve as in figs .",

    "usually one knows the @xmath92 order from the working context , and so these superscripts can often be suppressed .    before discussing other specific @xmath8 and @xmath9 cases , we consider the parametric formulas for an arbitrary curve and ribbon",
    ".      the @xmath1 curve @xmath93 is parametrized by the real non - negative parameter @xmath94 . for @xmath9 @xmath95 , in terms of modified bessel functions , @xmath96 , @xmath97 equivalently , @xmath98 follows due to the recursion relation for @xmath99 s .",

    "it is instructive to consider the statistically - fundamental @xmath105 with an @xmath8-independent normalization constant @xmath106 because in this way one sees that it is via normalization that the modified bessel function appears in development of the simple idea of charge - conservation - constrained poisson distributions for independent @xmath107 and @xmath108 production [ 5 , 8 ] .    for multi - pion final states",

    "for this reason , and for possible more abstract theoretical / mathematical use by other readers , the following details about how different shaped @xmath145 coordinate patches appear when mapped onto the 2d surface should be of interest .",
    "the lines @xmath150 , also @xmath151 for @xmath9-odd , and @xmath80 provide useful standard references in examining what is taking place on each ribbon .",

    "the spacing between these constant-@xmath53-value points is rather small , whereas on the right of the peak , where @xmath224 , the spacing between such points is significantly greater .",
    "the points are equally spaced in @xmath54 so there are more points taken at @xmath224 than at @xmath223 .",
    "horizontal  strips \" can similarly be used to study the folded @xmath225 region .",
