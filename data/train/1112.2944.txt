    "in the galaxy formation scenario based on the cold dark matter models , galaxies build up hierarchically @xcite . in this scenario , merging and accretion play key roles over cosmic time . from high redshift to the nearby universe",

    "large disk galaxies like the milky way ( mw ) and m31 are also thought to have assembled a significant fraction of their mass through interactions with other small galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "most of these interactions change the morphology and star formation history of the galaxy .    as a typical spiral galaxy in the nearby universe @xcite",
    ", m31 provides a unique and most important opportunity for testing this scenario on external spiral galaxies due to its proximity ( 785  kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "many recent studies have suggested that m31 is a promising example , exhibiting a hint of a past merger @xcite .",
    "most observational and theoretical results concern the halo and outer disk of m31 .",
    "especially , previous photometric and spectroscopic observations suggest that merging events have played an important role in the construction and evolution of the halo of m31 ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently , in addition to the well - known 10  kpc ring seen in previous observations ( @xcite and references therein ) , the presence of a second , inner dust ring was discovered in the disk of m31 @xcite .",
    "while a detailed study of the origin of the ring structure of m31 is needed , the two off - center circular rings suggest that the disk of m31 has been distorted by a very recent passage of its satellite galaxy through the disk ( i.e. , a head - on collision with the satellite galaxy about a few tens or hundreds myr ago , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this case , such a recent event may have enhanced the efficiency of star formation in the disk of m31 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "star cluster systems can be a tracer of galaxy formation and assembly , in the sense that significant star cluster formation is typically produced by major star - forming episodes in a galaxy @xcite .",
    "more than 400 globular clusters ( gcs ) are known in m31 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is about a factor of three more than in the mw .",
    "the gc system of m31 has two subpopulations , one is a metal - rich and spatially concentrated subpopulation and the other is metal - poor and spatially extended .",
    "the metal - rich gcs show  bulge - like \" kinematics with rotation @xcite .",
    "however , unlike in the mw , the metal - poor gcs also show significant rotation @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed a thin disk population of gcs which constitutes about 27  % of the @xcite sample .",
    "subsequently , it has been shown that at least a subset of these objects are in fact young ( @xmath3 1  gyr ) , metal - rich star clusters rather than old metal - poor gcs @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the mw , a large population of young clusters with ages less than 1 - 2  gyr is found in m31 @xcite .",

    "@xcite confirmed these young clusters using _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( @xmath0 ) ultraviolet ( uv ) photometry and suggested that the existence of young clusters in the outskirts of the m31 disk is due to the occurrence of significant recent star formation in the thin - disk .",
    "more recently , two comprehensive catalogs of young clusters in m31 have been published from the spectroscopic survey of @xcite and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data of @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated ages and masses of 140 young clusters and @xcite defined 156 young clusters with blue colors of @xmath7 .",
    "most of these clusters are more massive ( between 10@xmath8 and 10@xmath9  @xmath10 ) than the galactic open clusters @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they have similar characteristics to the blue star clusters in the lmc @xcite and other massive young clusters in local group galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , no such predominant counterparts have yet been discovered in the disk of the mw , except for a handful of massive young clusters identified in the center of the mw ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the existence of massive young clusters in the outskirts of the m31 disk indicates the occurrence of significant recent star formation in the disk of m31 @xcite . assuming that merging and accretion event triggered higher - level star formation in the disk of m31 than in quiescent galactic disks , it is interesting to examine the properties of star clusters related to the m31 disk , elucidating the recent star formation history in m31 .    motivated by the opportunity to study formation and evolution of young clusters in m31 , in this paper we construct a comprehensive multi - band catalog of star clusters in m31 compiled from rbc , @xcite , and @xcite samples .",
    "in particular , we included @xmath0 uv data , since the uv flux is highly sensitive to young main - sequence stars included in the massive young clusters which radiate more uv flux than in optical passbands @xcite .",
    "we select extensive subsamples of young clusters which is complementary with previous catalogs of young clusters in m31 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "various properties ( age , mass , metallicity , kinematics , and spatial distribution ) of young clusters are compared with star - forming ( sf ) regions and ob type stars in m31 , and with the 10 kpc ring structure .",
    "this allows us to test whether most young clusters may be the possible outgrowth of a recent accretion of satellite galaxy occurred at the center of the m31 disk .    in section 2 ,",
    "we describe optical and near - infrared ( nir ) data of the m31 star clusters compiled from previous catalogs . combining additional @xmath0 uv data and other auxiliary information , we present a final merged catalog of star clusters in m31 . in section 3 , by comparing observed spectral energy distributions ( seds ) with simple stellar population models , we estimate ages and masses of star clusters and select young clusters .",
    "we present properties of young clusters in section 4 .",
    "we also discuss the relationship between young clusters and m31 disk structures in terms of possible recent star formation history in the m31 disk .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in section 5 .",

    "for example , it is not easy to detect relatively faint star clusters which are mainly projected onto the bright disk structure or bulge of m31 .",
    "furthermore , some of the star clusters exist in the halo , far away from the host galaxy @xcite , requiring wide - field surveys of the outer halo of m31 .",
    "one of the most self - consistent catalogs of star clusters in m31 is that of @xcite , in which they presented @xmath11 and @xmath12 photometry of 435 clusters and cluster candidates .",

    "we measured the flux of each source within 3  pixel ( 4.5  arcsec ) radius and applied aperture correction using isolated stars in each image .",
    "the measured fluxes were converted to the ab magnitude system with the calibration of @xcite .",
    "our uv photometry is the same as that published by @xcite .",

    "in order to estimate accurate ages and masses of the star clusters using multi - band sed fitting , we need many photometric data points covering as wide a wavelength range as possible @xcite .",
    "in particular , uv photometry with optical one produces age constraints comparable to those of spectroscopic observations @xcite .",
    "our compiled catalog includes extensive photometric data in 16 bands from fuv to nir . on the other hand ,",
    "the photometric uncertainties are also important .",
    "since the @xmath11 data are from rbc v4 , we adopt photometric uncertainties following @xcite , i.e. , @xmath330.05  mag in @xmath34 and @xmath330.08  mag in @xmath35 .",
    "we also adopt a typical error ( @xmath330.05  mag ) for the @xmath12 data from rbc v4 . @xcite present @xmath15 and @xmath16 data and their photometric uncertainties .",
    "however , most of these uncertainties are extremely small , therefore we added a 0.05  mag uncertainty in all bands to account for zero - point inconsistencies among the various datasets .",
    "the photometric uncertainties of our @xmath0 fuv and nuv data are included in table 1 .    basically , the multi - band sed fitting method is a comparison between multi - band photometry and synthetic model magnitudes of simple stellar population ( ssp ) .",
    "a ssp is defined as a single generation of coeval stars characterized by fixed parameters such as metallicity , age , and stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "synthetic ssp models are calculated on the basis of a set of evolutionary tracks of stars of different initial masses , combined with stellar spectra at different evolutionary stages . in this paper",
    ", we compare the multi - band seds of our star clusters with magnitudes constructed from progressively reddened padua ssp models ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to estimate their ages .",
    "we use a @xcite imf with lower and upper mass limits of 0.10  @xmath36 and 100  @xmath36 .",
    "after age and extinction are constrained from the sed colors , scaling the best - fit model to the observed magnitudes yields the cluster mass , since the distance is known .    since the reddening is critical for an accurate age estimation of star clusters , we explored two ways for adopting a final reddening value .",
    "first , we adopted the reddening value from our merged catalog (  @xmath37 \" ) and only derived the cluster age from sed fitting , imposing the adopted @xmath23 .",
    "the second way was to treat both age and @xmath23 as free parameters in the sed fitting analysis (  @xmath38 \" ) .",
    "the @xmath38 is important for the 145 star clusters whose reddening values are not available in the literature ( see section 2.2 ) .",
    "since the uv extinction curve of m31 is similar to that of mw @xcite , we assumed mw - type interstellar reddening ( @xmath39 = 3.1 ) ( see @xcite for a discussion of the effects of different extinction curves ) . for our sed fitting analysis , we used model grids with five different metallicities , z = 0.0004 , 0.004 , 0.008 , 0.02 ( solar metallicity ) , and 0.05 , although m31 is believed to have a higher metallicity than the mw ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . in this paper",
    ", we did not consider metallicities lower than z = 0.0004 , since we focus on the young clusters which are mostly metal - rich with [ fe / h ] @xmath31 @xmath40 ( see section 4.2 ) .",
    "we ran the sed fittings using each metallicity for all star clusters , in order to assess the effects of this parameter .",
    "we compared the @xmath38 results from sed - fitting with the literature values of @xmath23 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "there is good agreement for part of the sample ( 28  % of the whole final sample have @xmath23 in agreement within @xmath41  mag ) while other sources have larger discrepancies .",
    "the @xmath38 values tend to be lower than literature values , but the mean difference is not significant ( mean @xmath42 @xmath170.09  mag with a @xmath43 of 0.19  mag ) . the adopted extinction curve , and model details , may also affect the results . more important for our purpose",
    "is the effect of the uncertainty in @xmath23 on the derived ages .",
    "we must recall first of all that for some of the catalog magnitudes compiled and used here , no errors are reported , which prevents derivation of formal errors from the sed fitting procedure ( a constant uncertainty of some reasonable value has to be assumed for the @xmath44 photometry ) .",
    "therefore , we estimated the robustness of the sed - based results by comparison with @xmath23 from previous works .",
    "figure 6 shows how the @xmath23 uncertainty affects the derived ages . where there is agreement in the derived @xmath23 ( e.g. , within 0.1  mag , for 37  % of the clusters if we used the results from fn@xmath15 assuming z=0.02 ) , obviously ages are in good agreement . in some cases where high discrepancies are seen",
    ", these may be due to some mismatch in seds between instruments ( for example due to nearby objects ) , or to several minima being possible in the sed fitting .",
    "overall , we see that the extraction of the `` young clusters '' subsample is not affected by these uncertainties .    in our sed fitting , we separated @xmath11 data from @xmath15 data in order to keep the homogeneity of optical data .",
    "we also separated @xmath12 ( rbc v4 ) from @xmath16 @xcite data .",
    "we considered four combinations of photometric passbands for our sed fitting .",
    "we include our uv data in each case .",
    "they are : ( 1 ) fuv , nuv , and @xmath15 (  fn@xmath15 \" ) , ( 2 ) fuv , nuv , and @xmath11 (  fn@xmath11 \" ) , ( 3 ) fuv , nuv , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 (  fn@xmath45 \" ) , and ( 4 ) fuv , nuv , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 (  fn@xmath44 \" ) . in figure 4",
    ", we present a sample ( b100 ) of sed fitting results with four different band combinations",
    ". the estimated ages are similar between four different results .",
    "however , in many cases of fn@xmath44 , the photometry in @xmath12 bands shows obvious offsets from uv and optical bands , probably due to the low resolution of 2mass ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "@xmath0 resolution is also low ( @xmath46 ) , uv - bright objects are rare , compared with ir sources , and contamination is less likely , although possible .",
    "the fn@xmath45 provides a homogeneous dataset , therefore we did not consider the fn@xmath44 in our final sed fitting analysis .",
    "sed analysis requires photometric measurements in at least three passbands .",
    "we run the sed fitting for combinations of five different metallicities , two different reddening treatments , and three photometric combinations of different passbands . based on the @xmath47 minimization result , we computed the best age , or [ age , @xmath23 ] combination , and the uncertainty in the derived value from the @xmath47 contours equal to minimum @xmath49 .",
    "we also computed the probability of the solution from each run to be the most appropriate one , given by a likelihood estimator of the form @xmath50 .",
    "of the 30 different estimates of ages and masses of each star cluster from our sed fitting analysis , we select final values with highest fitting probability .",
    "the typical uncertainty in age and mass is about 33  % across the whole sample , but smaller for younger clusters : 16  % for the subsample with ages @xmath2 1  gyr , and 44  % for the older clusters .",
    "these errors are the formal uncertainties from the sed - fitting with best metallicity and extinction chosen in each case .",
    "we recall however , that for some of the photometry no errors were available and a constant uncertainty had to be assumed for the whole catalog ; in addition , the derived mass uncertainty takes into account the photometric errors and the derived [ age , @xmath23 ] : when the extinction is high , a larger uncertainty might affect the estimated mass .",
    "the scatter between age and mass values from the best sed - fitting solution ( using the chosen metallicity and reddening ) and values obtained with different assumptions , gives an indication of possible additional uncertainties .",
    "the difference between ages derived using models with solar , versus z=0.05 metallicity , is @xmath51 50  % at about 1  gyr , @xmath51 30  % at 100  myr and much less for younger ages , higher metallicity yielding younger ages .",
    "the difference in resulting age using models with z=0.08 versus solar metallicity is somewhat smaller , and between solutions with z=0.008 versus z=0.004 is much smaller .",
    "precise estimates of metallicity from spectroscopy would be relevant to eliminate these factors of uncertainty .",
    "we obtained results for 403 , 185 , and 57 objects from fn@xmath15 , fn@xmath11 , and fn@xmath45 , respectively . in most cases ,",

    "we split the star clusters into two subgroups according to their residual velocity : thin - disk kinematics and non - thin - disk ( i.e. , bulge or halo ) kinematics .",

    "consequently , we suggest that young clusters are closely correlated with ob stars and uv sf regions in their spatial distributions , although ob stars and uv sf regions show a more extended structure in the disk of m31 . on the other hand , @xcite presented 3,691 hii regions on the disk of m31 .",
    "they also found a reasonable spatial correlation between the luminous ( @xmath86 ) hii regions and young clusters ( see figure 9 of * ? ? ? * ) .      in figure 19 , we compare ages of young clusters ( middle left panel ) and uv sf regions ( bottom left panel ) against the de - projected distance from the center of m31 .",
    "the overall young clusters distribution shows a single peak around 10 - 12  kpc .",
    "in addition to this main feature , a hint of small secondary peak is seen around 13 - 14  kpc .",
    "while young clusters in various age ranges within 1  gyr contribute to the main peak , the small secondary peak might be ascribed to younger clusters with ages less than 400  myr ( see inset of the middle left panel ) . on the contrary ,",
    "uv sf regions show two distinct peaks : a highest peak at @xmath1716  kpc and a secondary peak around 11  kpc .",
    "the ages of most uv sf regions are younger than 400  myr mostly due to our uv - based selection @xcite",
    ".    if young clusters are the result of active star formation in the m31 disk due to the head - on collision by a satellite galaxy , the age range of the majority of young clusters might be relevant to establishing the epoch of that event .",
    "although the age distribution of our sample is somewhat broad , the majority of young clusters is in the age range of 100 - 400  myr .",

    "as shown in figure 19 ( middle right panel ) , most young clusters have masses between 10@xmath87 and 10@xmath88 . while there is no clear correlation between mass and radial distance , interestingly , young clusters located around 10 - 14  kpc have a wider mass range , compared with those in other regions . in this region , both",
    "high - mass ( @xmath31 10@xmath89 ) and low - mass ( @xmath2 10@xmath90 ) young clusters are found .",
    "the uv sf regions by @xcite have a mass range wider than that of the young clusters and the majority have masses between 10@xmath91 and 10@xmath92 .",
    "it is worth noting that more massive ( @xmath31 10@xmath92 ) uv sf regions are also preferentially located at galactocentric distances around 10 - 14  kpc where massive young clusters are also found .",
    "another group of massive uv sf regions is found around 5  kpc . on the contrary ,",
    "low - mass uv sf regions are more numerous towards outer regions ( @xmath31 10  kpc ) of the m31 disk , and form a peak around 16  kpc .",
    "based on the rarity of young clusters and systematically low - mass ( and younger ) uv sf regions outside 16  kpc , we suggest that the outer part of the disk of m31 has an environment insufficient to trigger formation of massive star clusters .",
    "this is also supported by the hi and co surveys which show higher gas density around the 10  kpc ring and lower in outer parts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "using @xmath84 mips images , @xcite suggested that the morphology of the dust in m31 is well represented by a composite of two logarithmic spiral arms and a 10  kpc circular star forming ring offset from the nucleus . following the approach of @xcite , in figure 20 we examine the spatial arrangement of uv sf regions and young clusters . in the upper panels , the black large circle is the 10  kpc star formation ring , offset from the center of m31 by ( 4.5  kpc , 1.0  kpc ) and with a radius of 44  arcmin ( 10  kpc ) .",

    "the uv sf regions in the outer disk ( outside 12  kpc ) present several arcs rather than spiral arms pattern .",
    "the distribution of young clusters is more distinct and simple ; most young clusters are around the 10  kpc circular ring , while two spirals trace a handful of young clusters inside the 10  kpc ring . to confirm the distribution of uv sf regions and young clusters around the 10  kpc ring , in the lower panel of figure 20 we present their spatial distribution in polar coordinates .",
    "the position angle is defined to be increasing clockwise starting from northeast ( ne ) in the upper panels of figure 20 .",
    "the most interesting feature is the wavy distribution of sf regions and young clusters fitted by a black solid curve , representing the @xmath1710  kpc ring , except for the region around 220  deg where the ring splits .",
    "this wavy line is characterized by parameters of the circle shown in the upper panels of figure 20 .",
    "this wavy feature is more distinct in the case of young clusters ( colored filled circles ) .",
    "consequently , we confirm that the distribution of young clusters and uv sf regions in the m31 disk is consistent with a circular star formation ring with radius @xmath17 10  kpc in combination with simple logarithmic spirals .",
    "another thing to be noted in figure 20 is an asymmetric number distribution of young clusters with position angle .",
    "the number ( 125 ) of young clusters in the southern disk of m31 ( from 180 to 360  degree ) is larger than that ( 57 ) of young clusters in the northern disk ( from 0 to 180  degree ) .",
    "@xcite noted that the highly extincted star clusters with @xmath93 0.4  mag are preferentially located on the northwestern ( nw ) side ( see also figure 17 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if the difference is entirely due to the reddening being higher on the nw half , the frequency and distribution of young clusters in the northern disk based on currently available catalogs remains to be updated from extensive and deeper observations in future .",
    "a prominent feature in the southern part of the m31 disk is the region of ring split . in the distribution of both @xcite uv sf regions and our young clusters , a hole that matches the observed split in the ring near m32",

    "this was discovered by @xcite from the ir - emitting dust distribution , and they suggested that the split of the ring in the form of a hole is caused by a passage of m32 through the m31 disk ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "these peaks appear to be constituted mostly of clusters younger than 400  myr .",
    "recently , based on high - resolution subaru suprime - cam images , @xcite carried out a survey of compact star clusters in the southwestern part of the m31 disk including the ring splitting region .",
    "the apparent size of these compact clusters is less than 3  arcsec and for most sample it is smaller ( @xmath2 2.5  pc ) than typical mw gcs .",

    "these star clusters are mainly selected by specifying a lower limit of half - light radius ( @xmath94  arcsec or @xmath95  pc , see @xcite for the details ) .",
    "the majority of their compact clusters are young objects , with ages less than 1  gyr ( 186 of 238 ) and a peak around 70  myr .",
    "they span a mass range of 10@xmath96 - 10@xmath97 peaking at @xmath98 .    in figure 21 , we present age and mass distribution of our young clusters ( black filled and open circles ) and 186 compact star clusters ( gray filled circles ) younger than 1  gyr from @xcite . while the overall distribution of our young clusters is consistent with that of @xcite compact star clusters , it is obvious that @xcite detected more objects in the lower mass ( @xmath2 10@xmath90 ) and younger age ( @xmath2 100  myr ) ranges .",
    "about half ( 95 ) of their sample clusters are younger than 100  myr . in their sample",
    ", there is a lack of relatively massive ( @xmath31 10@xmath1 ) compact clusters with ages 400  myr - 1  gyr .",
    "young clusters included in our compiled catalog show systematically higher mass ( see mass histogram of figure 21 ) than the cluster sample of @xcite , probably due to the brighter limit of cluster selection used in previous literature .    in figure 22",
    ", we present the spatial distribution of 186 compact star clusters ( filled circles ) with ages younger than 1  gyr from @xcite along with our young clusters ( open circles ) . the clusters are divided into two age groups : younger than 100  myr ( blue ) and 100  myr - 1  gyr ( red ) .",
    "we also overplot the distributions of dust from @xmath84 irac 8.0  @xmath85 image ( gray contours ) and uv sf regions ( orange contours ) .",
    "the distribution of clusters younger than 100  myr follows well that of dust and uv sf regions .",
    "furthermore , as noted by @xcite , two clumps of young clusters are found at ( @xmath73 , @xmath83 ) @xmath17 ( @xmath2510.2  kpc , @xmath252.2  kpc ) and ( @xmath2510.5  kpc , @xmath250.5  kpc ) . on the other hand , relatively older ( @xmath31 100  myr ) clusters are widely distributed over the area .",
    "older ( @xmath31 100  myr ) clusters are preferentially located in the gap of the ring splitting area ( e.g. , @xmath259.5  kpc @xmath2 @xmath73 @xmath2 @xmath257  kpc and @xmath252.5  kpc @xmath2 @xmath83 @xmath2 @xmath250.5  kpc ) where dust and uv sf regions lack . regarding the scenario whereby the passage of m32 through the m31 disk triggered a burst of star formation @xcite , we speculate that older ( @xmath31 100  myr ) clusters in the ring splitting hole were formed at the epoch of the first passage of m32 , while formation of younger ( @xmath2 100  myr ) clusters around the hole region might be induced by later shock propagation .",
    "we constructed a comprehensive star cluster catalog which contains 700 m31 star clusters compiled from rbc v4 @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we detected 418 and 257 clusters in @xmath0 nuv and fuv , respectively , above flux limits of 23.7 and 23.6 abmags and measured their uv magnitudes .",
    "our catalog includes photometry in up to 16 passbands ranging from fuv to nir as well as ancillary information such as reddening , metallicity , and radial velocities .",
    "our merged catalog is the most extensive and updated one of uv photometry for m31 star clusters , superseding our previous uv catalog @xcite .",
    "we estimated ages and masses of star clusters by multi - band sed fitting ; the uv photometry enables more accurate age estimation of young clusters .",
    "we also extracted a sample of 182 young clusters with ages less than 1  gyr consisting of 173 clusters with our age estimation and 9 clusters from @xcite .",
    "our estimated ages and masses of young clusters are in good agreement with previous literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we examined the properties of young clusters such as age and mass distribution , metallicity , kinematics , and spatial distribution which provide unique probes of the star formation history of the disk of m31 , and the prominent 10  kpc ring structure in particular .",
    "the mean age and mass of the young clusters are about 300  myr and 10@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the mass range of our young clusters in m31 is similar to that of massive clusters found in the lmc and is in between those of galactic young clusters and old gcs @xcite . since most low - mass ( @xmath2 10@xmath99 ) clusters are young objects",
    ", we consider they may be disrupted within a few gyrs @xcite .",
    "the [ fe / h ] values of young clusters included in our catalog , which are mostly from @xcite , are systematically lower ( by more than 1  dex ) than those derived from high - quality spectroscopic data or inferred from our sed fitting . while high precision spectroscopic observations for an extensive sample of young clusters are anticipated , we suggest that most young clusters in m31 might have moderately enhanced metallicity ( i.e. , [ fe / h ] @xmath31 @xmath251.0 ) .",
    "such a high metallicity of the m31 disk and associated young clusters is consistent with the general result that spiral s stellar disk is metal - rich @xcite , when not experiencing substantial gas infall or outflow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    by comparing radial velocities of star clusters with a cold disk model , we selected a subsystem of star clusters with thin - disk kinematics , associated with the disk of m31 .",
    "we confirm that most of the young clusters show systematic rotation around the minor axis and are kinematically associated with the thin - disk of m31 .",
    "the majority of young clusters is located between 5 and 18  kpc from the center of m31 and shows a distinct peak around 10 - 12  kpc . the distribution of young clusters is closely correlated with that of other tracers of disk structure ( ob stars , uv sf regions , and dust ) .    considering their kinematical properties and spatial distribution , young clusters",
    "are well correlated with the 10  kpc ring structure in m31 .",
    "this structure , known as the ring of fire or star - formation ring , is off - centered from the galaxy nucleus ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite discovered an inner dust ring , offset from the center of m31 , and suggested that the two rings originated from a recent passage of a satellite . by numerical simulations",
    ", @xcite inferred that the star formation ring structure results from a head - on collision through the center of the disk of m31 by a companion satellite galaxy .",
    "this event can produce density wave rings which triggered massive star formation at the peak of the wave .",
    "they postulated a recent ( about 210  myr ago ) interaction between m32 and the m31 disk .",
    "we confirm that the spatial distribution of young clusters in the m31 disk is well re - presented by a circular 10  kpc star formation ring .",
    "although the age distribution of our sample is somewhat broad , the majority of young clusters is in the age range of 100 - 400  myr , which appear to be consistent with the prediction of @xcite .",
    "therefore , we speculate that a large fraction of young clusters found in the m31 disk might have formed during the recent interaction between a satellite galaxy and the m31 disk , in which the star formation ring also originated . in particular , there is a split of the ring structure in the southern part of the m31 disk which corresponds to a gap in both ir contours and uv sf regions .",
    "young clusters also show concentration outside the ring splitting and , furthermore , most of them have systematically younger ( @xmath2 100  myr ) ages .",
    "some young clusters in this region might derive from another interaction with a satellite galaxy , related with the southern stream emerging from the southwest disk of m31 @xcite .    within the context of merger history of m31 , it is not unreasonable that the star formation ring in m31 has been shaped by a recent collision of satellite accompanied by higher star formation rate than that of the mw @xcite . due to a recent major perturbation of the m31 disk , formation of significant young stellar populations and massive young clusters",
    "is expected .",
    "low - level star formation ( e.g. , in quiescent galactic disks ) tends to produce few , if any , massive young clusters .",
    "it is worth noting that m31 appears to be representative of the typical population of local spiral galaxies showing evidence of merging in the formation and evolution history ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the mw is a rather quiescent galaxy without any major interaction over the past few billion years . in this case",
    ", the mw disk may have evolved with a secular pattern ( e.g. , smooth gas accretion or infall ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) without any violent merging event .",
    "this kind of quiescent environment of the galactic disk can support the nonexistence of the populous massive young clusters found in m31 . on the other hand , although head - on collisions between galaxies are rare ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , m31 serves as an important local template , to understand more distant collisional ring galaxies ( @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "<S> we present a comprehensive catalog of 700 confirmed star clusters in the field of m31 compiled from three major existing catalogs . </S>",
    "<S> we detect 418 and 257 star clusters in _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( @xmath0 ) near - ultraviolet ( nuv ) and far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) imaging , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> our final catalog includes photometry of star clusters in up to 16 passbands ranging from fuv to nir as well as ancillary information such as reddening , metallicity , and radial velocities . in particular , this is the most extensive and updated catalog of uv integrated photometry for m31 star clusters . </S>",
    "<S> ages and masses of star clusters are derived by fitting the multi - band photometry with model spectral energy distribution ( sed ) ; uv photometry enables more accurate age estimation of young clusters . </S>",
    "<S> our catalog includes 182 young clusters with ages less than 1  gyr . </S>",
    "<S> our estimated ages and masses of young clusters are in good agreement with previously determined values in the literature . the mean age and mass of young clusters </S>",
    "<S> are about 300  myr and 10@xmath1 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the compiled [ fe / h ] values of young clusters included in our catalog are systematically lower ( by more than 1  dex ) than those from recent high - quality spectroscopic data and our sed fitting result . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that most of the young clusters kinematics show systematic rotation around the minor axis and association with the thin disk of m31 . </S>",
    "<S> the young clusters distribution exhibits a distinct peak in the m31 disk around 10 - 12  kpc from the center and follow a spatial distributions similar to other tracers of disk structure such as ob stars , uv star - forming regions , and dust . </S>",
    "<S> some young clusters also show concentration around the ring splitting regions found in the southern part of the m31 disk and most of them have systematically younger ( @xmath2 100  myr ) ages . considering the kinematical properties and spatial distribution of young clusters </S>",
    "<S> , they might be associated with the well - known 10  kpc star - formation ring structure in the m31 disk . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we suggest that various properties of young clusters in m31 might be in line with the scenarios that a satellite galaxy had passed through the disk of m31 less than few hundred million years ago . </S>"
