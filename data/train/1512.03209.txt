    "belongs to the subclass of so - called yellow symbiotic stars .",
    "its cool component is of early k spectral class instead of m as in most other symbiotic stars .",
    "the hot component is a white dwarf with an effective temperature of 100 000 k and a luminosity of @xmath1 @xcite obtained from the iue data .",
    "however , @xcite have derived @xmath2 k from the fuse far - uv spectrum .",
    "the orbital period of the binary system is @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "a shorter period around @xmath4 days has also been detected in photometric and spectroscopic variability of @xcite .",
    "@xcite ascribed this period to the pulsations of the k giant .    by its photometric variability , can be classified as a classical symbiotic star of type .",
    "its light curve , available since 1890 @xcite , shows frequent brightenings of about @xmath5 magnitudes in the @xmath6/visual band and up to 2.3 and 3.6 magnitudes in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands , respectively .",
    "major outbursts occur in intervals of @xmath9 years ( in 1936 , 1951 , 1966 , 1980 , 1994 , 2006 ) , and are usually followed by minor scale outbursts in intervals of about one year .",
    "@xcite have distinguished between cool and hot outbursts of .",
    "major outbursts in the beginning of active phases are usually cool ones , during which the expanding pseudo - atmosphere of the white dwarf cools down and the zanstra temperature drops . in smaller scale hot outbursts , the zanstra temperature increases or remains unchanged .",
    "the outburst activity of over 120 years was studied in our recent paper @xcite , using mostly photometric observations .",
    "there are numerous other studies available , making use of optical spectroscopy as well as other methods of observations ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "however , a lot of open questions remain concerning the nature and physical mechanism of the outbursts in particular . in the present paper ,",
    "we study the variability of emission lines in the optical spectrum of during almost 14 years ( september 1997 to april 2011 ) .",
    "this time interval includes the major outburst that started in july 2006 .",
    "a brief description of the behaviour of around this event was given by @xcite .",

    "spectroscopic observations of used in the present paper have been carried out on the 1.5-metre telescope at tartu observatory , estonia .",
    "the equipment and methods of observations and their reductions are described by @xcite ( hereafter l04 ) .",
    "starting from march 2006 , a new andor newton du-970n ccd camera with @xmath10 pixels ( pixel size @xmath11 ) has been used . with this camera ,",
    "dispersions @xmath12  pix@xmath13 or @xmath14  pix@xmath13 in the red spectral region , and @xmath15  pix@xmath13 in the blue region were achieved .",
    "test measurements have shown that the change of ccd detectors has no systematic effect on the obtained results .    altogether",
    "515 spectra of , recorded between september 1997 and april 2011 , are used in the present paper : 196 in the blue ( h@xmath16 ) spectral region , 221 in the red ( h@xmath17 ) spectral region with lower dispersion , and 98 in the red region with higher dispersion .",
    "a few spectra have been sporadically recorded after april 2011 , when the star was continuously in the quiescent stage q6 ( see sect .",
    "[ sect3 ] ) , data from those spectra do not affect our analysis .",
    "reductions of the spectra were done with the help of the eso midas software package , applying the standard procedures of subtracting the bias and sky background , calibrating into the wavelength scale , and normalizing to the continuum .",
    "we focus on the strongest emission lines in the wavelength regions under study : the hydrogen balmer lines h@xmath17 ( @xmath0 6563 ) and h@xmath16 ( @xmath0 4861 ) , the neutral helium line at @xmath0 6678 , the ionized helium line at @xmath0 4686 , and the raman scattered line at @xmath0 6825 . equivalent widths ( ew ) , peak intensities relative to the continuum , and positions of these lines were measured .",
    "uncertainties of the ews were estimated from repeated test measurements of a few spectra , they range from about 3 per cent for the strongest lines to about 10 per cent for weak lines .",
    "ews may not be a good indicator of emission line variations when the underlying continuum is variable .",
    "therefore , we have calculated absolute fluxes emitted in the lines , using the same photometric data as in @xcite .",
    "in addition , data from @xcite were applied . for interstellar reddening the value @xmath18",
    "was adopted according to @xcite .",
    "interpolation of the photometric data in wavelength scale and in time brings along additional errors , and so uncertainties in the emission line absolute fluxes may reach up to 1520 for the weakest lines .",
    "in fig . [ fig1 ] we present the @xmath19 light curves of from 1990 to 2012 , consisting of the quiescent and active stages .",
    "individual events are marked , and these labels will be referred to throughout the paper .",

    "the difference between the time shift for the light and the ew curves ( around 180 days ) is not essential , because the value of the time shift for the ew curves lies indeed in the range 2100 - 2300 days , and its particular value depends only on the selection of the time interval .",
    "the correspondingly shifted @xmath8 light curves and ew variability curves of and are shown in fig .",

    "those reasonable correlations could imply some similarity of the nature of the hot components and the mechanisms of the outbursts in and .",
    "cool giants of these symbiotic stars are of rather different spectral types , k2k3 and m4m5 , respectively .",
    "available estimates of the mass of the hot component ( wd ) are similar for both stars , @xmath20 ( with a preference towards a higher value ) for ag dra @xcite , and @xmath21 for @xcite .",
    "@xcite have adopted @xmath22 for .",
    "accordingly , the physical characteristics of the outbursts could indeed be similar in both stars , provided that the mass accretion rates onto the wd are comparable .",
    "the lower mass loss rate of the k giant compared to the m giant could be compensated by the smaller separation of the components in .",
    "it has been established long ago that a white dwarf alone is not capable of ionizing the nebulae of symbiotic stars to produce the characteristic emission - line spectrum .",
    "quasi - steady thermonuclear shell burning on the surface of the wd can provide additional energy , and this phenomenon appears to be common in most of the symbiotic systems @xcite .",
    "an accretion rate of a few times @xmath23 is sufficient to produce a luminosity of @xmath24 by a thermonuclear shell burning @xcite .",
    "the classical symbiotic outbursts , recurring every few years or decades , however , do not fit well into this picture . they are by far too frequent to be nova - like thermonuclear runaways like those in symbiotic recurrent novae @xcite .",
    "even with the wd mass close to the chandrasekhar limit , the recurrence times would be tens or hundreds of years @xcite .",
    "but wds in symbiotic systems seem to have a low mass ( around @xmath25 ) in most cases @xcite .",
    "the `` combination nova '' model proposed by @xcite seems to be a promising explanation , at least to the behaviour of z and .",
    "smaller scale hot outbursts ( e.g. in 1997 ) are explained by the accretion disc instability model like in dwarf novae @xcite .",
    "the @xmath26 outburst of was similar to the major ( cool ) outbursts of . according to @xcite ,",
    "the disc instability in this case triggered enhanced thermonuclear shell burning on the wd surface , thus resembling a classical nova outburst . for the @xmath27 wd , an average accretion rate of @xmath28 would be enough to both fuel the quasi - steady nuclear burning and accumulate enough material in the disc to trigger a combination nova event on time - scales of 10 years .",
    "the major ( cool ) outbursts of occur on a similar time - scale ( @xmath9 years ) .",
    "however , there is a fundamental difficulty because we do not have a firm evidence for the presence of an accretion disc in .",
    "radio observations of have indicated bipolar outflows @xcite , but those can be explained hydrodynamically by a disc - like density condensation in the orbital plane @xcite . no evidence of collimated bipolar jets like in @xcite neither short time - scale flickering @xcite has been found in .    a `` combination nova '' model might be applicable to , provided that a trigger mechanism for thermonuclear shell flashes can be found . triggering of major ( cool ) outbursts seems to take place close to some critical threshold , as in some cases ( active stages a and c in @xcite ) there has been not enough power to ignite additional nuclear reactions required to initiate a cool outburst .",
    "our conclusions can be shortly summarized as follows :     cool and hot outbursts of can be clearly distinguished by the behaviour of the emission lines in the optical spectrum ;     the raman scattered ovi line @xmath0 6825 almost disappeared during the cool outburst confirming a drop in the hot component s temperature as was also found from the variations of other emission lines ;     emission lines of hydrogen and neutral helium did not change significantly during the cool outburst .",
    "they are correlated with the orbital motion in quiescence and become stronger in hot outbursts ;     the similarity of the outbursts of and shows that a `` combination nova '' model might explain the outbursts of .",
    "the presence of an accretion disc in the system still lacks confirmation .",
