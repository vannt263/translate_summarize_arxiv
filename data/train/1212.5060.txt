    "this work is part of the mose ( modeling eso sites ) project , a feasibility study for the turbulence prediction at two eso sites : cerro paranal ( site of the vlt ) and cerro armazones ( future site of the e - elt ) .",
    "one of the main goal of the mose project is to supply a tool for optical turbulence forecasts to support the scheduling of the scientific programs and the use of ao facilities at the vlt and at the e - elt . in a joint paper , masciadri & lascaux @xcite",
    "have presented the results of numerical simulations of 20 different summer nights ( in november and december 2007 ) with the mesoscale model meso - nh @xcite with a standard configuration using 3 imbricated domains with the innermost horizontal resolution equal to @xmath0x=0.5 km .",
    "the results are already very encouraging , especially in the free atmosphere , with a good prediction of the meteorological parameters important to the optical turbulence estimation ( temperature , wind speed ) .",
    "the main discrepancies concerning the meteorological parameters between meso - nh predictions and observations have been identified near the surface ( between 2  m and 30  m above the ground ) , for the wind speed . to overcome these specific limitations of the standard configuration ,",
    "we discuss in this study the impact of the use of a higher horizontal resolution numerical configuration .",
    "two domains with a horizontal resolution equal for both to @xmath0x=0.1 km , centered above cerro paranal and cerro armazones , have been added .",
    "it is very important to well predict meteorological parameters such as wind speed and temperature , and their temporal evolution .",
    "indeed , the intensity of the optical turbulence , characterized by the structure constant of the refractive index @xmath1 , mainly depends on their values and gradients .",
    "our team have already used so far the meso - nh model to perform some meteorological , and optical turbulence , numerical simulations , at other sites ( san pedro martir @xcite , mount graham @xcite , antarctica @xcite ) discussing its abilities in predicting meteorological and astroclimatic parameters , but with less rich data samples .",
    "two sites are investigated in this study : cerro paranal , site of the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) , and cerro armazones , future site of the eso european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) . at paranal , observations of meteorological parameters near the surface come from an automated weather station ( aws ) and a 30  m high mast including a number of sensors at different heights .",
    "both instruments are part of the vlt astronomical site monitor @xcite .",
    "absolute temperature data are available at 2  m and 30  m above the ground .",
    "wind speed data are available at 10  m and 30  m above the ground . at armazones , observations of the meteorological parameters near",
    "the ground surface come from the site testing database @xcite , more precisely from an aws and a 30  m tower ( with temperature sensors and sonic anemometers ) .",
    "data on temperature and wind speed are available at 2  m , 11  m , 20  m and 28  m above the ground . at 2  m , at armazones , temperature measurements from the aws and the sonic anemometers are both available but we consider only those from the tower ( accuracy of 0.1@xmath2 @xcite ) .",
    "those from the aws are not reliable because of some drift effects ( t. travouillon , private communication ) .",
    "wind speed observations are taken from the aws ( at 2 m ) and from the sonic anemometers of the tower ( at 11  m , 20  m and 28  m ) .",
    "the outputs are sampled at 1 minute intervals .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "the intensity of the optical turbulence is mainly driven by the gradients of some meteorological parameters ( wind speed , temperature ) that determine the vertical profiles of @xmath1 . as these vertical profiles of @xmath1 , from which derive all the astroclimatic parameters useful for astronomers ( seeing , wavefront coherence time , isoplanatic angle ... )",
    "are characterized by a maximum in the surface layer , a good knowledge and prediction of the surface meteorological parameters is mandatory to obtain good forecast of the optical turbulence at a given site . in this study",
    "we have investigated the impact of very high horizontal resolution on the prediction of meteorological parameters ( temperature and wind speed ) near the surface at two montainous sites : cerro paranal ( site of the vlt ) and cerro armazones ( future site of the e - elt ) . in the standard configuration @xcite , less demanding in computing resources , the results are already very encouraging over the entire atmosphere above the sites of interest . nevertheless , some discrepancies on the wind speed prediction near the ground were present , with low - level simulated winds lower than the obervations . the work presented in this study adressed this particular problem by testing a very high horizontal resolution configuration ( 5dom , with @xmath0x=0.1 km for the innermost domains ) , more demanding in computing resources . in this preliminary study",
    "( only 9 nights for cerro paranal and 5 nights for cerro armazones were investigated ) , we demonstrated that a very high horizontal resolution improved significatively the performance of the model in proximity of the ground .",
    "concerning the temperature , not only the prediction of the low - level temperature remained very good ( with biases inferior to 1@xmath2 at all levels at both sites , and even equal to 0@xmath2 at 2 m at cerro paranal ) , but the day to night temperature gradient inversion was more accurately reproduced .",
    "concerning the wind speed , the comparison between 5dom simulations and observations gave biases reduced by more than a half at all levels , at both sites , with respect to the standard 3dom configuration .",
    "+ meteorological data - set from the automatic weather station ( aws ) and mast at cerro armazones are from the thirty meter telescope site testing - public database server@xcite .",
    "meteorological data - set from the aws and mast at cerro paranal are from eso astronomical site monitor ( asm - doc.n .",
    "vlt - man - eso-17440 - 1773 ) .",
    "we are very greatful to the whole staff of the tmt site testing working group for providing information about their data - set as well as to marc sarazin for his constant support to this study and for providing us the eso data - set used in this study .",
    "simulations are run partially on the hpcf cluster of the european centre for medium weather forecasts ( ecmwf ) - project spitfot .",
