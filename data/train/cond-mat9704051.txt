    "the `` colossal '' magnetoresistance ( cmr ) manganites r@xmath0a@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( r= la , pr , nd ; a= ca , ba , sr , pb ) have recently attracted considerable attention due to scientific interest and potential applicability of their very large magnetoresistance ( mr ) for @xmath3@xcite .",
    "the most essential feature of their magnetic and transport behaviors is the existence of metallic conductivity and ferromagnetism .",
    "the magnetic transition at @xmath4 is closely connected with the resistivity peak at @xmath5 corresponding to an insulator - metal transition ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the correlation between ferromagnetism and metallic conductivity in r@xmath0a@xmath1mno@xmath2 was explained by zener@xcite in terms of the double exchange mechanism .",
    "there are mixed valent mn ions ( mn@xmath7 and mn@xmath8 ) as a consequence of hole doping by substituting r@xmath7 with a@xmath9 . in the double exchange model ,",
    "conduction electrons in the partially filled @xmath10 levels of the @xmath11 band are strongly coupled with the tightly bound @xmath11 electrons in the @xmath12 levels by the on - site hund s coupling , and mediate the ferromagnetic exchange interaction between the nearest neighbor @xmath13 local spins formed from three @xmath11 electrons in the core - like @xmath12 levels@xcite .",
    "transport properties have been studied within the double exchange mechanism in favor of a magnetic polaron@xcite .",
    "recently , millis _",
    "et al._@xcite reported that the effective carrier - spin interaction involved in the ordinary double exchange hamiltonian is too weak to produce the magnetic polaron effects .",
    "instead , they suggested lattice polaron effects due to a strong electron - phonon interaction as a necessary additional extension @xcite .",
    "they investigated a model of electrons , jahn - teller coupled to localized classical oscillators , within the dynamical mean field theory .",
    "et al._@xcite also examined the combined influence of the electron - phonon interaction and the double exchange on @xmath4 using the variational wave function techniques .",
    "but they could not treat the polaron transport and the lattice dynamics on an equal footing .",
    "in fact , the contribution of the lattice polaron to carrier mobility was pointed out earlier by goodenough @xcite .",
    "there are many experimental evidences suggesting importance of the electron - lattice coupling in manganese oxides@xcite . near @xmath4",
    ", dramatic changes are observed in the lattice degree of freedom - the anomalous lattice expansion beyond grneisen law@xcite , and the shift of phonon frequency @xcite , which all reflect that the lattice is closely related to the electronic and magnetic properties .",
    "however , detailed understanding of the interplay between the lattice dynamics and the electronic and magnetic properties remains to be resolved .    in this paper ,",
    "we have addressed two questions ; i ) what is the role of the electron - phonon interaction in cmr systems which are known to have the double exchange interaction , and reversely , ii ) how the double exchange interaction affects the lattice dynamics through the electron - phonon interaction . for these purposes ,",
    "we first investigate effects of both the double exchange and the electron - phonon interaction on transport and magnetic properties . employing the kubo formula , we have determined the temperature dependent resistance and the magnetoresistance , and examined the crossover from a metallic tunneling state to an insulating hopping state in the small polaron transport .",
    "second , to characterize the lattice dynamics in cmr compounds , we have considered the phonon degree of freedom in the presence of the double exchange interaction .",
    "we have studied the renormalization of the phonon frequency and the phonon damping constant .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the model of conduction electrons coupled to phonons as well as the localized ionic spins in terms of the double exchange , whereby the temperature dependent resistance and the magnetoresistance are evaluated from the kubo formula . in section iii , we examine the double exchange effects on the lattice degree of freedom . finally , conclusions follow in section iv .",
    "detailed calculational steps are given in appendix .",
    "since zener@xcite has proposed an interaction between spins of magnetic ions named `` double exchange '' , anderson and hasegawa@xcite studied this mechanism in a system of mn ions and a mobile electron with the transfer @xmath14 between two mn ions and the strong intra - atomic exchange integral @xmath15 .",
    "when @xmath15 is much larger than @xmath14 , motion of the mobile electrons in r@xmath0a@xmath1mno@xmath2 is described by the following double exchange hamiltonian , _",
    "de=_ijt_ijcos c_i^c_j , where the hopping @xmath16 connects neighboring sites , and @xmath17 is the angle between the directions of ionic spins at sites @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "an exact quantum mechanical calculation gives @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the spin of a mn ion and @xmath22 is the total spin of @xmath23 , @xmath24 and the conduction electron spin . in this study",
    ", we treat the double exchange part within the mean field theory following kubo and ohata@xcite , in which @xmath25 is replaced by its thermodynamic average @xmath26 determined by minimizing the free energy of the spin system .",
    "then the propagation of an electron can be described as if it were moving in a mean field of highly disordered configurations of ionic spins .",
    "this approximation is known to work well at finite temperature , except for the very low temperature region @xmath27k ) where the spin dynamics becomes important . within the present mean field theory ,",
    "the double exchange plays a role , through @xmath28 , of increasing the bandwidth as @xmath29 decreases below @xmath4 , accompanied by the ferromagnetic ordering ( see fig .  [ bandw](a ) ) .",
    "in addition to the double exchange , the conduction electrons are scattered by the mn - o ionic motions in the mno@xmath30 octahedra , which gives rise to a very strong electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the effective hamiltonian incorporating the electron - phonon interaction is written as , = tcos_i c_i+^c_i + _ _ q a_^a _ + _ ic_i^c_i e^i_i m_q(a_+a_-^ ) . here",
    "we adopt a model in which the single @xmath10 orbital is coupled to phonons assuming the electronically active @xmath10 band to be split , as in rder _",
    "s @xcite .",
    "the present assumption is expected to be more effective if the model were generalized to include another physics such as the on - site coulomb interaction , which might remove possible mid - gap states away from the fermi level@xcite .",
    "the dc conductivity @xmath31 can be obtained from the optical conductivity @xmath32 by taking the @xmath33 limit , and @xmath32 can be determined by using the kubo formula of the current - current correlation function , ( ) = _",
    "-^de^i j_^()j_(0 ) .",
    "since the current operator @xmath34 in narrow band systems is given by = itcos_j c_j+^c_j , @xmath31 explicitly involves the four - site correlation function , = t^2cos^2e^2 _ ^_jj^ ( ) _ -^d c_j^()c_j+ ( ) c_j^+^^c_j^. in the isotropic case , the resistivity @xmath35 corresponds to the inverse of @xmath31 , @xmath36 .    to evaluate @xmath31 ,",
    "let s consider the well - known polaron canonical transformation@xcite ; @xmath37 with @xmath38 the transformed hamiltonian @xmath39 is given by    x_j=\\exp\\left[\\sum_{\\vec{q}}e^{i\\vec{q}\\cdot\\vec{r}_j }      \\frac{m_q}{\\omega_q}(a_{\\vec{q}}-a_{-\\vec{q}}^{\\dagger})\\right ] $ ] and @xmath40 .",
    "inserting @xmath41 between each electron operator in eq.(5 ) , and using @xmath42 and @xmath43 , one gets = t^2cos^2e^2 _ ^_jj^ ( ) _ -^d c_j^()c_j+ ( ) c_j^+^^c_j^ x_j^()x_j+ ( ) x_j^+^^x_j^.    the intricate correlation function of eq.(7 ) should be evaluated under the transformed hamiltonian @xmath39 .",
    "calculation can be further simplified with an approximation replacing the first term of eq.(6 ) by @xmath44 this approximation is quite reasonable in view of that the coherent band - like motion of the polarons arises from the quantum mechanical tunneling between sites without changing the phonon numbers , which is governed by the matrix elements of @xmath45@xcite . with increasing @xmath29 , the polaron bandwidth decreases exponentially due to the term @xmath46 , ( t)= , where @xmath47 ( see fig .",
    "[ bandw](b ) ) . under the above approximation ,",
    "the mean field scheme of kubo and ohata@xcite can be generalized to include the phonon contributions which drastically reduce the magnetic transition temperature @xmath4@xcite , whereas the temperature dependent behavior of @xmath48 does not appreciably change .    with the approximate hamiltonian @xmath39 incorporating both @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the complicated four - site correlation function in eq.(7 )",
    "can be disentangled into @xmath51 .",
    "these correlation functions and @xmath31 can be evaluated in the straightforward fashion .",
    "detailed calculational procedures are provided in appendix . from eq.(a12 ) , the dc conductivity @xmath31 is given as follows , @xmath52^{1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with a renormalized polaron band , @xmath53 .",
    "explicit expressions of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 are given in appendix .",
    "keeping in mind that the auto - correlation function is most dominant for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , @xmath31 is more simply obtained in the following form = t^2(t)^2e^2 nz _ _",
    "1_2 n__1(1-n__2 ) e^(__1-__2)/2 t e^-(__1-__2)^2/4(t ) e^-(t)e^(t)(/(t))^1/2 .",
    "here @xmath59 is the number of the nearest neighbors , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the fermion and boson distribution function , respectively , and @xmath55 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 are also given by ( t)=_|u_|^2(1 + 2n_q ) , ( t)=__q^2|u_|^2[n_q(n_q+1)]^1/2 , ( t)=2_|u_|^2[n_q(n_q+1)]^1/2 .",
    "now let s investigate the qualitative behavior of @xmath35 .",
    "one can carry out the numerical calculation of eq.(10 ) , assuming the simple square density of states ( dos ) @xmath64 , ( ) = , - . here the bandwidth @xmath65 is given by @xmath66 ( @xmath67 is the bare electron bandwidth and estimated to be @xmath68 from the band structure calculation ) , and the fermi energy @xmath69 is @xmath70 with @xmath71 being the doping concentration .",
    "these treatments of dos are based on the assumption that only the lower one of the split @xmath10 bands is active .",
    "we also assume that the most relevant phonon mode is the optical mode ( @xmath72 ) which might be involved in the jahn - teller coupling .",
    "numerical results for the resistivity are provided in fig .",
    "two dashed lines represent resistivities of the polaron only model with given bandwidths of @xmath73 and @xmath74 . here",
    "@xmath75 and @xmath76 correspond , respectively , to upper and lower limits of the double exchange factor @xmath49 . in both cases , @xmath35 s exhibit peaks as a function of @xmath29 , and the larger band width @xmath75 yields a smaller @xmath35 with a peak at higher temperature .",
    "the resistivity peak as a function of @xmath29 corresponds to the crossover from a quantum tunneling of the metallic phase to a self - trapped small polaron hopping of the insulating phase .",
    "such features are characteristics of polaron systems , which are indeed observed in many oxide systems . in the high @xmath29 limit",
    ", the resistivity has a thermal activation form of @xmath77 , characteristic of the semiconducting phase@xcite . now taking the double exchange into account , the polaron bandwidth increases with decreasing @xmath29 due to @xmath49 , and accordingly the resistivity is given by the solid line ( in fig .",
    "[ res ] ) with a peak at @xmath4 connecting the two polaron resistivity curves .",
    "this figure clearly demonstrates that the semiconducting behavior above @xmath4 is attributed to self - trapped lattice small polarons , and that the rapid fall - off in the resistivity below @xmath4 is attributed to the double exchange mechanism in addition to the lattice polaron effect .",
    "thus , the combined model of the double exchange and the polaron provides a good description of the resistance anomaly observed in the experiment .",
    "the coincidence of the resistivity peak position @xmath5 with @xmath4 originates from the mean field treatment of @xmath49 which neglects the fluctuation in the hopping of conduction electrons .",
    "effects of the external magnetic field can also be taken into account in @xmath49 through the modified free energy due to the magnetic field .",
    "the behaviors of the mr s are shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ res ] . with increasing the field intensity ,",
    "the resistivity decreases and the peak position shifts to a higher @xmath29 , and so the negative mr results .",
    "these results are quite consistent with the experimental observations .",
    "the mr peak @xmath78 is located near the resistivity peak @xmath5 . in fact , @xmath78 , @xmath5 , and @xmath4 are the same in the present mean field treatment .",
    "it should be noticed that the magnitudes of the mr s in the figure are not large enough to explain the experimental cmr data quantitatively , suggesting that additional treatments might be required .",
    "one possibility is to incorporate the half - metallic nature of the ferromagnetic manganites@xcite , which is expected to suppress largely the spin - disorder scattering under the external magnetic field .",
    "as mentioned before , the phonon frequency becomes hardened as @xmath29 decreases below @xmath4@xcite .",
    "interestingly , the phonon hardenings are observed for both optical and acoustic phonons in these systems .",
    "these frequency shifts are considered to be due to the change in the electron screening as @xmath29 is lowered below @xmath4 .",
    "the hardening occurs in the metallic region ( @xmath79 ) , _ i.e. _ , in the band - type tunneling regime where rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory is valid@xcite .",
    "therefore it is expected that the change of the bandwidth due to the double exchange factor @xmath49 modifies the electron screening below @xmath4 .",
    "note that the previous approximation for the canonically transformed hamiltonian @xmath39 corresponds to neglecting the phonon frequency renormalization , which seems to be too small to cause any appreciable change in the transport properties . in the metallic regime ,",
    "the screening of the conduction electrons will be more easily described by the original hamiltonian @xmath80 of eq.(2 ) rather than the polaron hamiltonian @xmath39 of eq.(6 ) .",
    "the renormalized phonon frequency @xmath81 and the damping constants @xmath82 can be obtained from the following equation@xcite ( _ q - i_q)^2=_q^2 - 2_q|m_q|^2 f ( , _ q+i0^+ ) , _ q _ q , where the electron screening function @xmath83 is given by ( , _ q ) = _ , t_=t_e^i .",
    "the real part of both sides of eq.(15 ) yields _ q^2_q^2 - 2_q|m_q|^2 _ .",
    "it is important to note that the term @xmath84 has very weak temperature dependences ( @xmath85 , @xmath86 being the fermi level determined from @xmath87 ) .",
    "hence the @xmath29-dependence of @xmath81 comes dominantly from @xmath49 , and eq.(17 ) can be written as @xmath88 , where @xmath89 contains all the @xmath29-independent terms .",
    "an explicit calculation of @xmath89 is not available , but the order of its magnitude should be very small , @xmath90 . in fig .",
    "[ phn](a ) , @xmath29-dependent behaviors of @xmath81 are plotted with respect to the external magnetic field strength @xmath91 , and compared with the available experiment@xcite in the inset .",
    "it is seen that the frequency hardenings with decreasing @xmath29 and with increasing @xmath91 are qualitatively well explained . however , it is also apparent that some deviations exist between calculational and experimental results , particularly , near @xmath4 .",
    "these discrepancies might be ascribed to the mean field treatment of @xmath49 . including spin correlation effects in calculating @xmath49",
    "is expected to improve the agreement .",
    "it should also be noted that the phonon frequency hardening of eq.(17 ) would be valid for both acoustic and optical phonon modes consistently with the experiments , because we have assumed the general form of the electron - phonon interaction in eq.(2 ) .",
    "taking the imaginary part for both sides of eq.(15 ) , one gets the phonon damping parameter @xmath82 , 2_q_q = 2_q|m_q|^2 _ . the imaginary part of the screening function is easily calculated by considering a parabolic electron band @xmath92 , 2_q=2_q|m_q|^2 , where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are determined from the parabolic band , @xmath95 . in fig .",
    "[ phn](b ) , @xmath29-dependent behaviors of @xmath82 are presented .",
    "our results predict that the phonon damping parameter decreases with decreasing @xmath29 , implying that the phonon is more sharply defined below @xmath4 .",
    "this feature in cmr systems is quite different from conventional observations of increased phonon damping parameter below @xmath4 for magnetic or strongly correlated systems . to our knowledge ,",
    "no experimental reports are available yet on the phonon damping parameter .",
    "we think that the sound attenuation experiment will provide a better understanding of the nature of the electron - phonon interaction in cmr systems .",
    "we have extended the double exchange model to incorporate the strong electron - phonon interaction , and investigated transport and magnetic properties of cmr manganese oxides r@xmath0a@xmath1mno@xmath2 .",
    "we have found that the semiconducting behavior in manganites above @xmath4 is attributed to the effect of self - trapped lattice small polarons , and that the rapid fall - off in the resistivity below @xmath4 is attributed to the combined effect of coherent lattice polarons and the increased bandwidth via the double exchange mechanism accompanied by the ferromagnetic ordering of magnetic ions .",
    "further , we have explored effects of the double exchange on the phonon degrees of freedom . the temperature dependent hardening of the phonon mode frequency observed in experiments is well described , and the reduction of the phonon damping constant is predicted below @xmath4 .",
