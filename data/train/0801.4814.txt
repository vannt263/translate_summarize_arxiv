    "observations of the circumstellar environments of lumnious blue variables ( lbvs ) with esa s infrared space observatory ( iso ) and modern ground - based imaging devices have demonstrated how sensitive mid - infrared imaging and spectroscopy can substantially improve our knowledge of the distribution of material , the physical and chemical properties of nebular dust and gas , and therefore on the history of mass loss from the surface of the massive central star during its evolution from the main sequence .",
    "other than the bright and compact environments of most lbv nebulae , none of the lower surface brightness nebulae around ob or wolf - rayet stars could be observed with iso due mainly to instrumental sensitivity limitations .",
    "the instruments on the _ spitzer _ space telescope have since offered significant gains in sensitivity and sky coverage ; for comparison , the _ spitzer _ infrared spectrometer ( irs ; 5.3  38 @xmath0 m ) is factor of @xmath150 - 100 more sensitive than the iso short wavelength spectrograph ( sws ; 2.4 - 45.2 @xmath0 m ) at 5 @xmath0 m , depending on resolution modes of the two instruments .",
