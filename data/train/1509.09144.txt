    "coulomb breakup of nuclei away from the valley of stability has been one of the most successful probes to unravel their structure . however , it is only recently that one is venturing into medium mass nuclei like @xmath1o @xcite and @xmath2ne @xcite , especially in and around the so called  island of inversion \" .",
    "this is a very new and exciting development which has expanded the field of light exotic nuclei to the deformed medium mass region .",
    "we consider the elastic breakup of a two body composite ` deformed ' projectile @xmath3 in the coulomb field of a target @xmath4 , @xmath5 , where projectile @xmath3 breaks up into fragments @xmath6 ( charged ) and @xmath7 ( uncharged ) .",
    "the reduced transition amplitude , @xmath8 , for this reaction is given by @xcite @xmath9    the ground state wave function of the projectile @xmath10 appears in the first term ( vertex function ) , while the second term that describes the dynamics of the reaction , contains the coulomb distorted waves @xmath11 .",
    "this can be expressed in terms of the bremsstrahlung integral . @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the mass factors pertaining to the three - body jacobi coordinate system ( see fig . 1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite ) . in eq . 1",
    ", @xmath15 is an effective local momentum appropriate to the core - target relative system and @xmath16 s ( @xmath17 ) are the jacobi wave vectors of the respective particles .",
    "@xmath18 [ in eq .",
    "( [ a4.2 ] ) ] is the interaction between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , in the initial channel .",
    "we introduce an axially symmetric quadrupole - deformed potential , as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the depth of the spherical woods - saxon potential , @xmath21 is the quadrupole deformation parameter . the first part of the eq .",
    "( [ a4.3 ] ) is the spherical woods - saxon potential @xmath22 with radius @xmath23 . @xmath24 and @xmath3 being the radius and diffuseness parameters , respectively . to preserve the analyticity of our method",
    ", we calculate the radial part of the ground state wave function of the projectile using the undeformed woods - saxon potential ( radius and diffuseness parameters taken as 1.24 fm and 0.62 fm respectively , which reproduce the ground state binding energy ) .",
    "we emphasize that the deformation parameter ( @xmath21 ) has already entered into the theory via @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ a4.2 ] ) . for more details on the formalism",
    "we refer to ref . @xcite .",
    "the nucleus @xmath0 mg has a large uncertainty in its one - neutron separation energy ( @xmath26 mev @xcite ) and has controversies regarding its ground state spin - parity .",
    "recently measured large breakup cross section @xcite and reaction cross section @xcite seems to suggest a halo structure in @xmath0 mg .",
    "the nuclei in island of inversion are expected to have significant components of @xmath27 [ @xmath28 $ ] neutron intruder configurations . indeed , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been argued that the valence neutron in @xmath0mg@xmath29 is most likely to have a spin parity ( @xmath30 ) of @xmath31 that corresponds to the @xmath32 orbital . for the sake of completeness , in this work",
    "we have considered neutron removal from @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 orbitals .",

    "@xcite ) is shown by the shaded band .",

    "1(a ) , we show the results of our calculations for the pure coulomb @xmath35 in the breakup reaction of @xmath0 mg on a pb target at the beam energy of 244 mev / nucleon as a function of @xmath42 corresponding to one - neutron removal from the @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 orbitals . for @xmath41",
    "we have used the shell model values as given in ref .",
    "@xcite , which are 0.31 and 0.001 for the @xmath37mg@xmath38 , and @xmath37mg@xmath39 configurations , respectively .",
    "however , for the @xmath37mg@xmath40 configuration the sm @xmath41 is not given in this reference .",
    "therefore , we have assumed a @xmath41 of 1.0 for this case .",
    "the shaded band in this figure shows the corresponding measured cross section taken from ref .",
    "@xcite with its width representing the experimental uncertainty .",
    "we note that calculated cross sections obtained with the @xmath37mg@xmath43 configuration ( solid line in fig .  1 ) , overlap with the experimental band in the @xmath42 region of @xmath44 .",
    "theoretical cross sections for the @xmath45 case are almost identical to those of the @xmath32 case . on the other hand , for the @xmath37mg@xmath39 and @xmath37mg@xmath46 configurations",
    "there is no overlap between calculated cross sections and the data band .",
    "therefore , our results support a @xmath30 = 3/2@xmath47 ground state for @xmath0 mg with a one - neutron separation energy of @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath42 deduced in our work is closer to the evaluated value of @xmath48  @xcite , with lesser uncertainty .    nevertheless , with @xmath41 for the @xmath37mg@xmath39 configuration as extracted in ref .",
    "@xcite ( 0.40 ) , the cross section curve for this case will also overlap with the experimental data band as shown in fig .",
    "however , the extracted @xmath42 in our case is @xmath49 mev , instead of 0.40@xmath50 mev deduced in ref .",
    "in fact , with the combination of the mean values of @xmath42 and @xmath41 ( 0.40 mev and 0.40 ) for this configuration deduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , there would be no overlap between the theoretical cross section and the experimental data band in our calculations .",
    "( a ) @xmath35 as a function of the deformation parameter @xmath21 in the coulomb breakup of @xmath0 mg on a pb target at the beam energy of 244 mev / nucleon with the configuration @xmath37mg@xmath38 for @xmath0mg@xmath29 .",
    "the s@xmath36 is taken to be 0.22 mev with @xmath41 values being 0.42 ( solid line ) and 0.31 ( dashed line ) .",
    "( b ) same as in fig .",
    "2(a ) for @xmath37mg@xmath39 configuration with @xmath41 and @xmath42 of 0.40 and 0.40 mev , respectively . in both",
    "( a ) and ( b ) the experimental data ( shown by the shaded region ) are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite.,scaledwidth=50.0%,height=151 ]    in fig .",
    "2(a ) , we show our results for @xmath35 as a function of @xmath21 for the @xmath37mg@xmath38 configuration of @xmath37mg@xmath29 with @xmath41 values of 0.42 and 0.31 and taking a @xmath42 of 0.22 mev ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) in both the cases . for @xmath51 ,",
    "the @xmath35 in each case is the same as that shown in fig .  1 , which is below the experimental data . with increasing @xmath21 , the cross sections in both the cases increase , and the overlaps between calculations and the data take place in ranges @xmath52 and @xmath53 for @xmath41 of 0.42 and 0.31 , respectively",
    "we add that if for @xmath41 = 0.31 the @xmath42 as deduced in fig .",
    "1 is taken then calculated cross section would overlap with the data band at much lower values of @xmath21 .    in fig .",
    "2(b ) we show the same results for the @xmath37mg@xmath39 configuration with @xmath41 and @xmath42 values of 0.40 and 0.40 mev , respectively , ( which is the mean value of these quantities as deduced in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this case",
    ", we see that in contrast to the results in fig .",
    "2(a ) , there is no overlap between calculated cross sections and the data band for any value of @xmath21 in the range of 0@xmath541.0 .",
    "we have checked that the situation remains the same for @xmath21 @xmath55 1.0 . moreover ,",
    "the contribution of the deformation term to the cross section is substantially low for the @xmath56-wave configuration , which results in almost constant @xmath35 as a function of @xmath21 as seen in fig .",
    "therefore , in our calculation , even with deformation a @xmath56-wave configuration is ruled out for @xmath0mg@xmath29 for the @xmath41 and @xmath42 combination deduced in ref .",
    "in this paper we have studied the coulomb breakup reaction @xmath0 mg + pb @xmath57 @xmath37 mg + n + pb at the beam energy of 244 mev / nucleon , within the framework of the post form finite range distorted wave born approximation theory that is extended to include the projectile deformation effects . in this formalism",
    "the transition amplitude is factorized into two parts - one containing the dynamics of the reaction and the another the projectile structure informations such as the fragment - fragment interaction and the corresponding wave function in its ground state .",
    "analytic expressions can be written for both parts .",
    "this formalism opens up a route to perform realistic quantum mechanical calculations for the breakup of neutron - drip line nuclei in the medium mass region that can be deformed .",
    "we calculated the total one - neutron removal cross sections ( @xmath35 ) in this reaction and compared our results with the corresponding data reported in a recent publication  @xcite .",
    "our calculations seem to favor a @xmath30 = 3/2@xmath47 spin assignment to the @xmath0 mg ground state with one - neutron separation energy ( @xmath42 ) of @xmath44 mev , if the spectroscopic factor ( @xmath41 ) for this state is taken to be the corresponding shell model value of 0.31 . however , the deduced @xmath42 depends on the chosen value of @xmath41 .",
    "our study shows that @xmath42 rises steadily with increasing @xmath41 .",
    "indeed , due to the uncertainty in the @xmath41 value for the @xmath37mg(@xmath58 ) @xmath59 @xmath60 configuration for the @xmath0 mg ground state , the @xmath30 = 1/2@xmath61 spin assignment to it can not be fully excluded based on the present data .    in order to gain more insight in the ground state structure of @xmath0 mg",
    ", we studied the effect of the projectile deformation on @xmath35 .",
    "we find that for the configuration @xmath37mg(@xmath58 ) @xmath59 @xmath62 for the @xmath0 mg ground state , the calculated @xmath35 overlaps with the experimental data band in certain range ( that depends on the value of @xmath41 ) of the quadrupole deformation parameter ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "however , with the @xmath37mg(@xmath58 ) @xmath59 @xmath60 configuration , the overlap does not occur between calculated and measured @xmath35 for any reasonable combination of @xmath21 and @xmath41 values .",
    "this supports the @xmath30 = 3/2@xmath47 spin assignment for the @xmath0 mg ground state .",
    "however , for unambiguous confirmation one also needs to calculate @xcite more exclusive observables such as the core - valence neutron relative energy spectra , the energy - angle and the angular distributions of the emitted neutron and the parallel momentum distribution of the core fragment .",
    "the position of the peak as well as the magnitude of the cross section near the peak of the core - valence neutron relative energy spectra would to be dependent on the configuration of the projectile ground state as well as on its deformation .",
    "our study is expected to provide motivation for future experiments on breakup reactions of the neutron rich medium mass nuclei .",
