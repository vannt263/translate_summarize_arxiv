    "studies of multiparticle correlations have proven to be a powerful tool in exploring the underlying mechanism of particle production in high energy hadronic collisions .",
    "inclusive two - particle correlations have been found ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) to have two components : direct two - particle correlations as well as an effective `` long - range '' correlation due to event - by - event fluctuations of the overall particle multiplicity . by considering the two - particle rapidity density at fixed multiplicity",
    ", the intrinsic correlations between particles were isolated and found to be approximately gaussian , with a range of @xmath2 unit in pseudorapidity ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "thus , these correlations have been conventionally called `` short - range '' correlations .",
    "their properties have been explained by the concept of `` cluster '' emission .",
    "the simple idea that hadrons are produced in clusters , rather than individually , has had great success in describing many features of particle production @xcite . in a scenario of independent cluster emission ,",
    "clusters are formed before the final - state hadrons and are independently emitted according to a dynamically generated distribution in @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the clusters subsequently decay isotropically in their own rest frame into the observed final - state hadrons .",
    "an independent cluster emission model has been widely applied to the study of two - particle correlations @xcite , where the observed correlation strength and extent in phase space can be parameterized in terms of the cluster multiplicity , or `` size '' ( the average number of particles in a cluster ) and the decay `` width '' ( the separation of the particles in pseudorapidity ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that independent cluster emission is only a phenomenological approach which provides no insight about cluster production mechanisms . further modeling will be required to connect these studies to the underlying qcd dynamics .",
    "a related measurement , studying the forward - backward multiplicity correlations , was performed in au+au collisions at center of mass energy per nucleon pair ( @xmath6 ) of 200  gev using the phobos detector at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite .",
    "the event - by - event observable @xmath7 is constructed , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are defined to be the total multiplicity in two symmetric regions forward and backward of mid - rapidity .",
    "the variance ( @xmath10 ) , which is related to the cluster size , was measured .",
    "an effective cluster size of approximately 2 - 3 , increasing with the size of the pseudorapidity window , was observed . in heavy ion collisions at rhic",
    ", it has been predicted that the formation of a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) could modify cluster properties relative to p+p collisions @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the method used in ref .",
    "@xcite was found to have intrinsic limitations for measuring the properties of clusters emitted near mid - rapidity .",
    "this makes direct tests of these predictions difficult and suggests a need for different methods to access cluster properties directly .    in order to explore the properties of short - range correlations in more detail and to study cluster properties quantitatively ,",
    "this paper presents the two - particle angular correlations in p+p collisions at center of mass energies ( @xmath11 ) of 200 and 410  gev over a very broad acceptance in @xmath0 ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath1 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the phobos octagon detector , covering pseudorapidity @xmath14 over almost the full azimuth , is well suited to measure the correlations between particles emitted from clusters , which have been found to extend up to @xmath0 = 2 - 3 units of pseudorapidity .",
    "the observed two - dimensional ( 2-d ) correlation function shows a complex correlation structure in the hadronic final state . in this analysis , both the cluster size and its decay width",
    "are extracted from the two - particle correlations as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the energy , multiplicity and @xmath1 dependence of the cluster size and decay width are studied and compared to previous measurements as well as pythia @xcite and hijing @xcite predictions at various energies .",
    "our present study in p+p collisions will provide a useful baseline measurement for understanding the hadronization stage in a+a collisions .",
    "the data presented here for p+p collisions at @xmath15 200 and 410  gev were collected during rhic run 4 ( 2004 ) and run 5 ( 2005 ) using the large - acceptance phobos octagon multiplicity detector covering pseudorapidity @xmath14 over almost full azimuth . a full description of the phobos detector can be found in ref .",
    "single diffractive p+p events were suppressed by requiring at least one hit in each of two sets of 16 scintillator trigger counters located at distances of @xmath16 m and @xmath17 m from the nominal interaction point @xmath18 along the beam axis .",
    "they cover an acceptance of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "about 0.5 million 200  gev and 0.8 million 410  gev p+p events were selected for further analysis by requiring that the main collision vertex fell within @xmath21  cm along the beam axis .",
    "the angular coordinates ( @xmath22 ) of charged particles are measured using the energy deposited in the silicon pads of the octagon .",
    "the granularity of the octagon is determined by the sizes of the readout pads which are about @xmath23 ( @xmath24 0.2 radians ) in @xmath5 and range from 0.006 to 0.05 in @xmath4 .",
    "monte - carlo studies using the pythia event generator show that , in the low - multiplicity p+p environment , 98% of hits on adjacent pads in @xmath4 are created by single primary particles with a small angle of incidence .",
    "all such neighboring hits are merged to single hits in order to avoid fake particle pairs .",
    "noise and background hits are rejected by cutting on the deposited energy corrected for the path length through the silicon after hit merging , assuming that the charged particle originated from the main vertex .",
    "depending on @xmath4 , the merged hits with less than 50 - 60% of the energy loss expected for a minimum ionizing particle are rejected . more details of the hit reconstruction procedure can be found in ref .",
    "following an approach similar to that in ref .",
    "@xcite , the inclusive charged two - particle correlation function in two - particle ( @xmath25 ) space is defined as follows :    @xmath26    where , @xmath27 is the single charged particle density distribution and @xmath28 denotes the charged particle pair distribution . here",
    "@xmath29 is the cross section of observing @xmath30 charged particles .",
    "the above distributions obey the normalization relations : @xmath31 and @xmath32    in practice , we concentrate on the difference in azimuthal angle and pseudorapidity between two particles . the correlation function in eq .",
    "[ 2pcorr_incl_4d ] is simplified by averaging over the full acceptance @xmath33 and @xmath34 , reducing the dimensionality of the parameter space to @xmath0 and @xmath1 with a range of @xmath35 and @xmath36 :    @xmath37    the pair distribution @xmath38 ( with unit integral ) is determined by taking particle pairs from the same event , then averaging over all events .",
    "the mixed - event background , @xmath39 ( with unit integral ) , is constructed by randomly selecting single particles from two different events with similar vertex position , representing a product of two single particle distributions .",
    "the vertex bin size of 0.5  cm used in event - mixing is mainly determined by the vertex resolution of the detector in p+p collisions .",
    "since the background is found to be multiplicity independent , we use the inclusive @xmath39 in our calculations of eq .",
    "[ 2pcorr_incl ] .",
    "the track multiplicity @xmath30 is introduced to compensate for trivial dilution effects from uncorrelated particles @xcite .",
    "this stems from the fact that the number of uncorrelated pairs grows quadratically with @xmath30 , while the number of correlated pairs grows only linearly .",
    "the phobos octagon detector has a single layer of silicon , and so does not provide momentum , charge or mass information for the observed particles .",
    "thus secondary effects , such as @xmath40-electrons , @xmath41 conversions and weak decays can not be directly rejected .",
    "these will contribute to correlations unrelated to those between primary hadrons , and modify the shape of the measured correlation function .",
    "the incomplete azimuthal acceptance in some pseudorapidity regions naturally suppresses the overall correlation strength , but mc simulations show that it does not change the shape of the correlation in @xmath0 and @xmath1 . to correct for these detector effects in the data ,",
    "correlation functions are calculated for pythia events at @xmath11 = 200  gev both at the generator level for true primary charged hadrons , @xmath42 ( fig .  [ corr_2d_rawpmc]a ) and with the full geant detector simulation and reconstruction procedure , @xmath43 ( fig .  [ corr_2d_rawpmc]b ) . as will be illustrated in fig .",
    "[ corr_2d_finaldata_bothenergy ] , the actual information in @xmath44 is reflected to the full @xmath0 and @xmath1 range in order to more clearly show the shape of the correlation function .",
    "the whole correction procedure can be summarized by the following equation :    @xmath45.\\ ] ]    the overall correlation structure consists of both intrinsic and secondary correlations and these two sources of correlations are found to be largely independent of each other in mc studies , i.e.  the correlation from secondaries is mostly determined by sensor thickness , detector geometry , known cross - sections and decay kinematics .",
    "first , within a narrow vertex range ( 2 cm ) , we compare the generator level mc correlation function excluding particles outside the phobos detector acceptance , @xmath46 , to the correlation function observed after processing the same mc events with all the primary hadrons through the geant simulation , @xmath43 ( fig .",
    "[ corr_2d_rawpmc]b ) .",
    "the difference between the two correlation functions , @xmath47 ( fig .",
    "[ corr_2d_rawdata]b ) , is attributed to the effects of secondary interactions , weak decays , and the reconstruction procedure :    @xmath48    to estimate the suppression of the correlation strength due to limited acceptance , we compare @xmath42 and @xmath46 using a @xmath49 test to extract a scaling factor , @xmath50 , for each vertex bin :    @xmath51^{2 } } { \\sigma_{\\rm pri}^{\\rm mc}(\\delta \\eta , \\delta \\phi ) \\times a \\times \\sigma_{\\rm pri , acc}^{\\rm mc}(\\delta \\eta , \\delta \\phi ) } \\ , d\\delta \\eta d\\delta \\phi\\ ] ]    where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the uncertainties of the correlation function @xmath42 and @xmath46 .",
    "this scaling factor , @xmath50 , is independent of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and is found to vary between 1.3 and 1.5 over the vertex range used in this analysis .    to get the final correlation function , @xmath54",

    "[ acceptance_corr ] is used to remove the suppression due to the holes in the phobos acceptance .",
    "this procedure is done separately for each vertex bin .",
    "three different mc generators are used to estimate the systematic uncertainties to the correlation function from this correction procedure , including pythia , hijing and a modified pythia in which all intrinsic correlations have been removed by performing event mixing at the primary hadron level ( i.e.  before weak decays ) .",
    "typically the systematic error ( biggest for the peak at @xmath0=0 and @xmath1=0 ) is less than 5% .",
    "both the correlation function for the data ( fig .",
    "[ corr_2d_rawdata]a ) and for the pythia simulations ( fig .",
    "[ corr_2d_rawpmc]b ) have a sharp peak at small @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which is twice as high in the data as in the fully simulated mc events , but which is not present in the analysis using primary particles from the mc generator ( fig .",
    "[ corr_2d_rawpmc]a ) . in the full geant simulations ,",
    "the particles contributing to this peak are found to be mainly @xmath40-electrons ( 50% ) and @xmath41 conversions ( 40% ) .",
    "the width of the peak is about 0.3 in @xmath0 and @xmath56 in @xmath1 for both data and mc , indicating the same origin .",
    "however , the final data still contain a much narrower peak at the near - side of @xmath54 ( fig .",
    "[ corr_2d_rawdata]c ) .",
    "it is likely that this small angle structure results from background and detector effects which are not included in the mc simulation , although it is not possible to rule out unknown physics effects not implemented in the event generators . since the physics of the cluster - like particle production investigated in this analysis",
    "is dominated by correlations on scales of approximately one unit in @xmath0 , as will be shown later , we proceed by rejecting pairs in a small two - particle acceptance of @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( the single bin centered at @xmath0=0 and @xmath1=0 ) .",
    "studies using primary particles from mc generators and the fully simulated events show that the extracted cluster parameters , described in the next section , change by less than 0.1% due to this cut .",
    "in addition to the systematic errors related to the correction procedure , other systematic uncertainties are calculated by varying the vertex position and hit threshold cuts , and by studying the time dependence of the results within the two data sets .",
    "since the acceptance of our detector is strongly dependent on vertex position , any systematic uncertainties due to acceptance and geometrical description should manifest themselves as a dependence of the final results on vertex position .",
    "the hit threshold cuts are used to discriminate between primary particles and noise or background hits ; a variation of the thresholds allows us to test the impact of noise and background hits on the final results . for each selection of reconstruction parameters , a set of correlation functions are constructed under different conditions ( i.e.  10 different vertex positions ) , and fully corrected using the mc procedure described above .",
    "the rms of these correlation functions is calculated as an estimate of the systematic error from each particular source .",
    "the systematic errors due to the vertex position dependency , hit threshold cuts and variations in different subsets of events are added in quadrature to get the total rms for each bin in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the vertex position dependency turns out to be the dominant source of the uncertainties .",
    "the final systematic uncertainties are quoted as 90% c.l.(1.6 @xmath59 rms ) .",
