    "while the above expressions are in principle exact , the many - body self - energies must be calculated at some level of approximation . the lowest order in the interaction",
    "@xmath11 corresponds to the time - dependent - hartree - fock ( tdhf ) approximation .",
    "the many - body problem is reduced to consider hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) with @xmath33 and a renormalized level given by @xmath34    the fourier components of the local particle density @xmath35 must be evaluated self - consistently .",
    "this level of perturbation theory leads to a vanishing inelastic contribution @xmath36 and it is not suitable for the description of kondo physics .",

    "the effects of @xmath98 are vanishingly small and the description effectively reduces to tdhf . the induced @xmath61 is also very small ( @xmath99 ) . for low @xmath11 , the inelastic contribution to the current ( @xmath100 ) is negligible .",
    "therefore , within this regime , @xmath0 is qualitatively similar to the non - interacting one , shown in dotted line .",
    "as the hybridization between the dot and the side reservoirs is sizable , the resonant peak is wide and the `` adiabatic '' ( @xmath101 behavior ) is observed within a wide range of @xmath1 .",

    "first , it is clear that self - energy effects now play an important role .",
    "this is evident in the drastic changes experimented by the density of states as well as in the fact that the current departs from the behavior predicted by the tdhf approximation , which is shown in light dot - dashed line in the figure .",
    "the second feature to remark is that , although inelastic processes are negligible for low @xmath1 , as discussed in section iii.c , they become sizable as @xmath1 increases even at @xmath91 ( see dashed line of the main frame of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the third remarkable issue is the lose of the `` adiabatic '' behavior , namely , the departure from the linear dependence in @xmath1 .",
    "we identify two ingredients that contribute to this effect : ( i ) the first one is the induced pumping potential at the interacting site , which becomes sizable @xmath105 and changes significantly with @xmath1 .",
    "this feature manifests itself even at the tdhf level , in which case the range of pumping frequencies where @xmath106 becomes very narrow ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "( ii ) the other ingredient is the development of the kondo resonance . recalling that the underlying assumption for low frequency expansions like the one leading to eq .",
    "( [ pertel ] ) is that the typical width of the energy levels of the structure is @xmath108 , it can be understood that the reduction of the width of the resonant level due to the kondo effect originates a concomitant reduction of the range of @xmath1 for the `` adiabatic '' behavior to be observed .",
    "for the parameters of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , which correspond to @xmath109 , such a linear behavior is not captured even close to the lowest pumping frequency considered ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "the final issue worth of mention is the inversion in the sign of the current with respect to the non - interacting case . in general , even in the simpler case of a system without many - body interactions , the issue of the sign of the current is one of the most delicate features to predict in a problem of quantum pumping . in the case of structures with low hybridization with the contacts presenting a landscape of well separated resonances ,",
    "the issue of the sign of the current has been analyzed in detail in refs . .",
    "in those works , the origin for the sign inversion of the current has been identified to be the interference between two resonant electronic levels mixed by a high pumping frequency .",
    "in order to gain insight on the different processes involved in the present problem , let us first analyze the behavior of the sign of the current in the non - interacting limit of our setup of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in that case",
    "the dc current ( [ jdc ] ) can be also written as follows @xcite : @xmath111 where the `` transmission '' function @xmath112 depends on the green s functions of the system with @xmath33 .",

    "[ fig5 ] . unlike the function @xmath112 defined for the non - interaction system , the function @xmath121 changes as the chemical potential changes . for this reason",
    ", several plots corresponding to different values of the chemical potential , for which we have verified that the kondo resonance is developed , are shown in the figure .",

    "on general physical grounds , the symmetry of the problem in the case of identical pumping amplitudes at the two barriers indicates that @xmath134 .",
    "however , the many - body treatment adopted in the present work breaks such symmetry for high enough induced @xmath61 , even at the level of the simple self - consistent tdhf approximation , i.e. even disregarding self - energy effects",
    ". the self - consistent evaluation of higher harmonics ( we recall that we truncate at @xmath93 ) , and additional self - energy and vertex corrections that we have not taken into account are expected to restore such symmetry . in any case",
    ", our results should be interpreted as a piece of evidence on the departure from the @xmath135 behavior induced by the interactions .",
    "so far , we have focused in the case of temperature @xmath91 , where inelastic effects play an insignificant role at low @xmath1 .",

    "the elastic contribution vanishes as the kondo resonance disappears while the inelastic one increases due to the corresponding grow of @xmath139 .",
    "the latter increment translates into the inverse time @xmath140 , thus increasing the range of @xmath1 where the behavior @xmath8 holds .",
    "in fact , notice that the range of low @xmath1 where the plots of fig . [ fig4 ] look horizontal increases with increasing @xmath87 .",
    "to conclude , we have analyzed a simple model for an interacting quantum pump by means of non - equilibrium green s function techniques and within a second order self - energy approximation .",
    "we have shown that the effective time - dependent scattering center induced by the interactions generates interference effects , which should be detected in a @xmath141 experimental curve , following the pattern predicted by eq .",
