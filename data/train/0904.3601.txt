    "compared to the case of pions the electromagnetic productions of kaons are less understood .",
    "this is due to the fact that the strangeness quantum number is explicitly present in the final state of the process .",
    "although the reactions involving kaons are slightly more complicated , the additional degrees of freedom created by the strangeness can give information not available from nucleons and pions .",
    "for instance , due to the conservation of the strangeness , the production of kaons is always accompanied by the creation of hyperons , which can be used to deeply explore the structure of the nucleus since they are not blocked by the pauli principle . on the other hand",
    ", this elementary process provides an important input for the calculation of hypernuleus photo- or electroproduction . along with the fact that some @xmath0 resonances that were predicted in quark models have only noticeable branching ratios into the @xmath1 channel ,",
    "kaon photo- and electroproduction clearly have drawn many attentions for more than five decades .",
    "the earliest attempt to theoretically explain kaon photo- and electroproduction was proposed by kawaguchi and moravcsik more than 50 years ago@xcite .",
    "interestingly , all of the six possible isospin channels were already considered by utilizing only three feynman diagrams of the born terms , though hitherto no experimental data were available .",
    "the results were obviously very modest and , in fact , the cross sections for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 channels were predicted to be zero since neither nucleon anomalous magnetic moments nor resonance contributions were taken into account . since that time considerable efforts were devoted to explain the appearing experimental data , although only thom who tried to seriously fit the data to an isobar model .",
    "after that , there were a number of works using isobar model@xcite , dispersion relation@xcite , multipoles analysis@xcite , and regge approach@xcite .",
    "after the mid - seventies , the interest in this field was temporarily dormant , mainly due to the lack of experimental facilities .",
    "the interest in kaon photo- and electroproduction was revived by the constructions of modern accelerators such as those in jlab , mami , elsa , and others laboratories .",
    "the work of adelseck , bennhold , and wright started the new era of phenomenological models in @xmath4 photoproduction@xcite .",
    "this work was refined with the inclusion of more data and electroproduction process@xcite and extended to all isospin channels@xcite .",
    "a chiral quark model with less parameters has been also put forward@xcite in an attempt to recover the low energy theorem .",
    "the results of this model are modest and , in fact , the @xmath5 cross section is predicted to be larger than that for @xmath6 by a factor of approximately two , since contributions from the seagull and @xmath7-channel resonance have opposite signs .",
    "modern calculations of kaon photoproduction exploit chiral perturbation theory@xcite and coupled channels analysis@xcite . in the higher energy regions ,",
    "the regge@xcite or hybrid models@xcite ( a combination of the feynman diagrammatic technique and regge formalism ) turn out to be more appropriate .",
    "nevertheless , for practical use such as for nuclear applications and other phenomenological studies , the single channel isobaric analysis is still proven to be powerful@xcite .",
    "historically , experimental data of kaon photo- and electroproduction can be divided into two categories , old data ( published before 1980 ) and new data ( published after 1990 ) .",
    "a list of references for old data is given , e.g. , in refs.@xcite , whereas the corresponding kinematical coverage for the photoproduction is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] .",
    "surprisingly , the old data cover also forward angle regions , the case which is very difficult to achieve with the presently available technologies , as obviously shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] . as discussed in the following section ,",
    "this region is in fact very decisive for constraining the models and for nuclear applications .",
    "nevertheless , the data quality is in general poor and , as a consequence , the cross sections data do not show resonance structures .",
    "there were few data available for the recoiled @xmath8 polarization and two data points on the target asymmetry .",
    "kaon photoproduction started to become more interesting after the publication of saphir data@xcite on the @xmath4 and @xmath6 channels in 1998 , since the corresponding error bars allow for an identification of resonance structures , especially in the @xmath4 channels .",
    "further analysis of saphir data@xcite as well as the new clas data@xcite confirmed these structures .",
    "note that in both saphir and clas data sets , there are plenty of data on the recoil polarization . together with the new data from the leps@xcite and graal@xcite collaborations , these data provide a strong constraint on the proliferation of phenomenological models . in the @xmath9 channels ,",
    "new data have also appeared from saphir collaboration@xcite ( @xmath5 ) , and from the leps collaboration@xcite ( @xmath10 ) . the ability to reverse",
    "the direction of photon helicity in the spring8 has led to the measurements of the photon asymmetry @xmath11 in the @xmath4 , @xmath6 , as well as @xmath10 channels@xcite .",
    "since the polarization of the recoiled @xmath8 can be obtained without any additional apparatus , measurements of the double polarization observables @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( or @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) are possible , provided that the polarized photon beams are available .",
    "the first measurement of these observables was performed by the clas collaboration@xcite and because the available beams at jlab are circularly polarized , the corresponding observables are @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "very recently , by utilizing the linearly polarized photon the graal collaboration has been able to measure the @xmath14 and @xmath15 observables@xcite from threshold up to @xmath16 gev .",
    "the electroproduction experiments with high statistics have been also performed at jlab@xcite .",
    "it is reported that the longitudinal and transverse components of the cross section can be nicely separated@xcite , whereas the transferred polarization in the @xmath17 process has been measured@xcite .",
    "in spite of their unprecedented high statistics , the new clas@xcite and saphir@xcite data reveal a lack of mutual consistency in the forward and backward regions .",
    "this problem can be summarized by the total cross section shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tot ] , where it is obvious that fitting a phenomenological model to both data sets simultaneously results in a model which is inconsistent to all data sets . as shown by ref.@xcite",
    "this problem also hinders a reliable extraction of the resonance parameters , since the use of saphir and clas data , individually or simultaneously , leads to quite different resonance parameters .",
    "therefore , the presently available data do not allow for a firm conclusion on the extracted `` missing resonances '' .    by using four different isobar models ref.@xcite studied the statistical properties of both clas and saphir data .",
    "it is found that the saphir data are coherently shifted down with respect to the clas and leps@xcite data , especially at forward kaon angles . a global scaling factor of 15%",
    "is required to remove this discrepancy .",
    "the phenomenon also implies that the leps data are more consistent with the clas data than the saphir ones .",
    "interestingly , at forward angles both clas and leps data sets can be described reasonably well within the isobaric model without hadronic form factors .",
    "this can be understood from the energy distribution of the cross sections at this kinematics , as will be discussed in the following subsections .",
    "the statistical study recommend that a combination of clas , leps , and old for the definition of old data ] data sets in the fitting data base is the more preferred choice , while a combination of clas and saphir data should not be assumed in fixing parameters of models , especially at forward angles .    despite considerable efforts to alleviate this problem ,",
    "it is still difficult to determine which data set should be used to obtain a reliable phenomenological model .",
    "the reason is that in all analyses the experimental data are fitted by adjusting a set of free parameters , while the precise values of these parameters are not well known .",
    "furthermore , the extracted parameters are not unique and also sensitive to the number of resonances used in a model . in view of this , ref.@xcite proposed to use other quantities which can be predicted by the models and can be directly compared with the results from other measurements or model predictions .",
    "one of the possible quantities is the contribution of the @xmath18 channel to the gerasimov - drell - hearn ( gdh ) sum rule @xcite , which relates the anomalous magnetic moment of the proton @xmath19 to the total photoabsorption cross sections @xmath20 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath21 . by looking at the energy distributions of the @xmath20 obtained from models that fit to clas and saphir data shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sigtt ] , it is obvious that the two data sets lead to different contribution to @xmath19 .",
    "it is then concluded that contribution from the model that fits to the saphir data sets is more preferred@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , experimental measurement of the @xmath20 is clearly required to confirm this claim .",
    "since the saphir detector has been dismantled , measurements of the @xmath20 by the clas or mami collaboration seem to be the only choice .",
    "the beam - recoil polarization observables data , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , published by the clas collaboration@xcite recently , indicate that the @xmath8 polarization is predominantly in the direction of the spin of the incoming photon .",
    "it is interesting that recent analyses found that these data seems to be difficult to explain . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is reported that the inclusion of these data reduces the complicated structure of the total cross sections @xmath20 as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sigtt ] , which indicates that the @xmath12 and @xmath13 data select only certain important resonances , i.e. the @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 resonances .",
    "this finding corroborates the result of a recent coupled channels analysis .",
    "@xcite      the first version of saphir data on @xmath26 released in 1994 did not give any hint about resonance structures in the cross section , since the statistics was very limited@xcite .",
    "however , by collecting more statistics the second version of saphir data@xcite released in 1998 display two distinct peaks in the total cross section at @xmath27 mev and 1900 mev .",
    "more accurate data published by the saphir@xcite and clas@xcite collaborations 5 and 8 years later , respectively , confirm the existence of the two peaks ( see fig.[fig : tot ] ) . by comparing the extracted resonance widths and branching fractions with the predictions of a constituent quark model@xcite , ref.@xcite concluded that the second peak corresponds to the @xmath28 nucleon resonance that is missing from the pdg list@xcite .",
    "although many subsequent analyses used this spin 3/2 nucleon resonance in their models , there was a suggestion@xcite that this peak could come from other resonances such as @xmath29 , @xmath30 or @xmath31 .",
    "however , the possibility of using these resonances , instead of the @xmath28 , has been also discussed in ref.@xcite , but it was ruled out after comparing the extracted widths and branching fractions with the predictions of quark model .",
    "further study using a multipoles approach@xcite found that , in spite of their differences , both saphir@xcite and clas@xcite data sets indicate that the peak originates from the @xmath32 resonance with a mass between @xmath33 mev .",
    "the necessity of the @xmath32 in the analyses of @xmath4 photoproduction with a mass of around 1900 mev has been also corroborated by recent coupled channels analyses@xcite .",
    "note that in these analyses the recoil polarization data have been also taken into account .",
    "it is quite interesting , however , that a recent effective field theory analysis suggests that the peak should correspond to the @xmath30 state which is a bound state of @xmath34 with a mixture of @xmath35 and @xmath36 components@xcite .",
    "to confirm this idea , two experiments are proposed , i.e. first to exclude contributions of the spin 3/2 states and second to find an indication of the @xmath34 bound state . on the other hand",
    ", a preliminary study@xcite performed by constraining the free parameters in a multipole analysis@xcite to the pdg values indicates that the peak originates from the contributions of both @xmath29 and @xmath30 states with masses around 1920 mev . in this study",
    "it is found that the contribution of the @xmath29 state is stronger than that of the @xmath30 and the result does not depend on which data set is being used in the fitting database .      since the dominant contributions to the total cross section shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tot ] come from the forward angles data , the largest discrepancies between the clas and saphir data obviously show up at the forward angles .",
    "unfortunately , the available phenomenological models vary wildly at these kinematical regions .",
    "this situation is clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : forward ] , in which we can see that for @xmath37 our best knowledge on kaon photoproduction can not tell us about the actual values of differential cross sections .",
    "meanwhile , theoretical predictions of the hypernuclear photo- or electroproduction rely heavily on the elementary operator extracted from kaon photo- or electroproduction data at very forward angles . as an example , in the electromagnetic production of the hypertriton , the magnitude of differential cross section is only realistic for experimental measurement at @xmath38 , whereas at @xmath39 the cross section is practically zero@xcite . in view of this ,",
    "accurate and reliable experimental data as well as theoretical formulation of kaon photoproduction in the forward region are the first condition toward a reliable prediction of the hypernuclear photoproduction cross section .",
    "it has been well known that the background terms become divergent at high energies .",
    "therefore , the use of hadronic form factors to reduce the background contribution is desired .",
    "it is also known that the use of this form factor leads to the violation of gauge invariance of the amplitude . as a result",
    ", several methods have been put forward in the last decades to overcome this problem .",
    "two of the well known prescriptions are due to ohta @xcite and haberzettl @xcite . as can be seen from the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : had_ff ] , the latter is superior since it can provide a reasonable description of experimental data , i.e. producing relatively much smaller @xmath40 , using values for the leading couplings constants close to the su(3 ) values . in ohta s method",
    "this is not possible due to the absence of a hadronic form factor in the electric current contribution .",
    "since then , most of the phenomenological models include hadronic form factors in their background terms . on the other hand ,",
    "ref.@xcite proposed to use certain hyperon resonances , the @xmath41 and @xmath42 , for counterbalancing the strength of the born terms .",
    "this is achieved through a destructive interference between these @xmath43-channel resonances and the born terms , thereby reducing the strength to a realistic level .",
    "however , the method is not so convincing for the huge number of presently available experimental data and , on the other hand , the use of hadronic form factor is more flexible and simultaneously takes into account the fact that nucleons are composite objects , and not point - like .",
    "recently , ref.@xcite has demonstrated that the behavior of forward - angle cross sections as a function of the energy for models that include the hadronic form factors is far from realistic .",
    "this finding is depicted in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : had_ff ] , where the hadronic form factors drastically suppress the cross sections at @xmath44 gev .",
    "although no data are available for comparison at this kinematics , such a strong damping has not been observed in the experimental data near the forward angles . as can be seen in figs .  4 and 6 of ref.@xcite differential cross sections for",
    "@xmath45 tend to be flat up to @xmath46 gev .",
    "therefore , the concept of hadronic form factors in meson photoproduction needs to be revisited in the future .      by considering the conservation of quantum numbers ,",
    "there are six possible reaction channels for kaon photoproduction on the nucleon , three on the proton and three on the neutron . except for the @xmath18 channel , these possible reactions",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iso ] , where the calculations obtained from kaon - maid are compared with the available data .",
    "note that there are few data points available just recently for the @xmath47 differential cross section released by the leps collaboration@xcite .",
    "thus , there are no data for the neutral kaon photoproduction on the neutron , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , although from fig .",
    "[ fig : iso ] it is clear that the data can severely constrain the model , especially in the @xmath48 channel .",
    "furthermore , the investigation of the @xmath50 potentials through the @xmath51 reaction requires the information from these two channels@xcite .",
    "we note that important progress in this direction has been indicated by the newly published @xmath52 data by the tohoku s group@xcite .",
    "it is also important to note that the @xmath53 photoproduction excludes the @xmath54-channel in the born terms .",
    "thus , by comparing photoproductions of @xmath55 and @xmath53 , one can study the influence of the kaon propagator in kaon photoproduction .",
    "it is widely known that the electroproduction process can give more information not available from the photoproduction one .",
    "one of the important information is the electromagnetic structure ( form factor ) of the kaon , which is hiding in the longitudinal cross section ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "in contrast to the pion case , where the mass of pion is much smaller and therefore the @xmath54-channel can dominate the process , so that an independent extraction is possible@xcite , the extraction of kaon electromagnetic form factor requires a reliable phenomenological model .",
    "consequently , accurate measurements of @xmath56 are required for this purpose . however , as seen from the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : electro ] , the presently available data still do not allow for the extraction of this form factor . furthermore , to suppress contaminations from nucleon resonances , measurements with @xmath57 gev are recommended .",
    "the recent progress and some important issues in photo- and electroproduction of kaon on the nucleon have been briefly presented .",
    "it is quite apparent that more experimental and theoretical works are needed to settle the present problems in this field .",
    "nevertheless , with the modern concept of accelerator and spectrometer technologies available at jlab , mami , elsa , spring8 , and other laboratories , we are quite optimistic that these problems can be solved in the near future .",
