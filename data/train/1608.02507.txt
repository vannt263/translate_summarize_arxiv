    "one of the many challenges of physics is to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the phenomena produced by strong coupling quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , responsible for the binding of quarks inside hadrons and for more than 95% of the mass of the visible universe .",
    "hadrons are color singlets due to color confinement .",
    "hence , the simplest structures are @xmath6 ( quark - antiquark ) for mesons and @xmath7 ( 3-quarks ) for baryons . however , there are many other ways we could build color neutral hadrons , for example : glueballs made out of a number of gluons , multi - quark states such as tetraquarks ( @xmath8 ) or pentaquarks ( @xmath9 ) , hybrid mesons and baryons with gluonic components ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) and so on . for a recent , brief and pedagogical summary of the current status of hadron physics we refer the reader to @xcite .    in the last years",
    "we have witnessed a dramatic advancement in detection techniques and accelerator technologies from the experimental side and algorithms for first principle qcd analyses on the theoretical side @xcite .",
    "consequently , many experimental facilities throughout the world have research programs on hadron spectroscopy , among them : lhcb @xcite , cms @xcite and compass @xcite at cern ( geneve , switzerland ) , clas12 @xcite and gluex @xcite at jefferson lab ( newport news va , usa ) , besiii @xcite at the beijing electron positron collider ( beijing , china ) , kloe2 @xcite at laboratori nazionali di frascati ( frascati , italy ) , belleii @xcite at kek ( tsukuba , japan ) , the hadron experimental facility @xcite at j - parc ( tokai , japan ) , and ( hopefully ) the future panda @xcite at fair ( darmstadt , germany ) . as a result , several candidates for _ exotic _ hadrons beyond the @xmath6 and @xmath7 picture have been discovered both in the meson @xcite and baryon @xcite sectors .",
    "given the experimental and theoretical interest on hadron spectroscopy , the joint physics analysis center ( jpac ) @xcite was set up to develop theoretical and phenomenological analysis methods to support hadron physics experiments .",
    "it started out in 2013 with 8 researchers , as a joint venture between indiana university , george washington university and jefferson lab .",
    "currently it has expanded to 20 researchers distributed among the three founding institutions plus rheinischen friedrich - wilhelms universitt bonn and johannes gutenberg universitt mainz in germany , ific / csic - universidad de valencia in spain , and universidad nacional autnoma de mxico in mexico .",
    "the jpac researchers are using s - matrix theory principles , _i.e .",
    "_ analyticity , crossing symmetry and unitarity @xcite to develop scattering amplitudes for several hadron reactions of theoretical and experimental interest in doing so , we work closely with experimentalists to implement the amplitudes in the existing data - analysis software .",
    "the methods to write the amplitudes include the k - matrix @xcite and n / d parametrizations @xcite .",
    "these can be complemented with chiral symmetry constraints at low - energies @xcite or regge asymptotics @xcite if needed .",
    "the amplitudes can be analytically continued from the real axis where the experimental data _ live _ to the complex-@xmath12 plane and to the unphysical riemann sheets , which allows us to unravel the existing resonances contributing to the physical reactions .",
    "it is important to note that the amplitudes developed by jpac and the analytical continuation to the complex plane are also necessary to extract the resonances and their properties from first principle lattice gauge qcd @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we briefly summarize some of the results obtained by the group during the last two years .",
    "three - body decays play an essential role studying hadron dynamics and hadron spectroscopy .",
    "the extraction of cp violation phases often requires the amplitude analysis of three - body @xmath13 and @xmath14 decays @xcite and several candidates for non - quark model states have been observed in heavy mesons decaying into three particles @xcite .",
    "heavy - meson decays have complicated phase spaces and their analysis can be cumbersome , hence , it is better to test our ideas on amplitude - building with simpler cases , like the decay of light mesons ,",
    "_ i.e. _ @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 @xmath15 .",
    "besides , these decays are interesting _ per se _ given the current and forthcoming precision data from various collaborations @xcite . for these reasons",
    ", at jpac we have developed an intensive work on dispersive approaches for three - particle final state interaction based on the khuri - treiman equations @xcite and generalized veneziano amplitudes @xcite , this last work for @xmath16 decay , although it can also be used for light - meson decays .",
    "based on the dispersive approach we have developed amplitudes for @xmath3 @xcite , @xmath4 @xcite , and @xmath5 @xcite decays to @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath18 decay is of particular interest because it is isospin - breaking and provides insight on the light - quark mass difference @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the masses of @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath12 quarks respectively . in @xcite",
    "we performed a simultaneous global fit to the kloe-2 @xcite and wasa - at - cosy data @xcite with two real parameters and we determined @xmath25 @xcite by matching our dispersive approach to nex - to - leading order chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath26 ) near the adler zero @xcite .",
    "meson - baryon scattering is one of the main resources to study the baryon spectrum . at jpac ,",
    "we have focused on @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath1 @xcite scattering because these are common final states detected in hadron experiments . in @xcite",
    "we developed high - energy @xmath0 amplitudes using regge physics @xcite and connected them to the low - energy amplitudes ( resonance region ) from @xcite using dispersion relations and finite - energy sum rules ( fesrs ) .",
    "consequently , we built a new set of @xmath0 amplitudes that cover the whole energy range for forward scattering .",
    "in @xcite we built a coupled - channel @xmath1 scattering model in the resonance region that incorporates up to 13 channels per partial wave and fulfills unitarity , has the correct analytical properties for the amplitudes in the resonance region and has the right threshold behavior for the partial waves .",
    "we also imposed analyticity of partial waves in the complex angular momentum plane @xcite .",
    "the model was fitted to the kent state university single - energy partial waves @xcite using a genetic algorithm @xcite and minuit @xcite .",
    "we estimated the uncertainties in the parameters using bootstrap technique @xcite .",
    "once the model was fitted to the single - energy partial waves and the parameters established , we analytically continued the partial waves to the unphysical riemann sheets and found the @xmath27 and @xmath28 poles ( resonances ) that constitute the low - lying hyperon spectrum @xcite . we expect to develop forward - scattering @xmath1 amplitudes @xcite that cover the whole energy range combining high - energy @xmath1 regge amplitudes with the low - energy amplitudes in @xcite using fesr as was done in @xcite for @xmath0 scattering .",
    "the identification of baryons beyond the constituent quark model ( either hybrids with glue as an essential constituent , molecules or pentaquarks ) requires the identification of a whole flavor family , and not only the detailed study of one particular state @xcite .",
    "resonances of different angular momenta share the same regge trajectory , what gives the spectrum an organized structure @xcite .",
    "the structure of the spectrum and the shape of the trajectories provide information on the composition of the states @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we combined regge phenomenology @xcite , the information on the hyperon spectrum from @xcite , and the @xmath29(1405 ) pole positions from @xcite to gain insight on the nature of the two @xmath29(1405 ) states .",
    "we found that the higher - mass pole appears to be ( mostly ) a three - quark hyperon and the lower - mass pole either a molecule or a pentaquark @xcite .",
    "another front where jpac is producing results is meson photoproduction .",
    "in particular , we have worked on two kaon photoproduction @xcite , high - energy pion photoproduction @xcite and @xmath2 photoproduction @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "the double - regge limit for the @xmath30 reaction was computed .",
    "this reaction has been measured by clas collaboration ( currently under analysis ) and is of interest to study mesons with hidden strangeness that decay into two kaons .",
    "the double - regge production mechanism constitutes a background to the reaction that contributes to the whole dalitz plot and needs to be removed in order to isolate the mesons of interest .",
    "there are many pion photoproduction models in the literature that describe the resonance region @xcite but not recent ones for the high - energy regime .",
    "considering that clas and gluex collaborations will collect pion photoproduction data in the @xmath31 gev region we developed a high - energy neutral pion photoproduction @xcite that covers the @xmath32 gev region where the regge poles dominate the amplitudes .",
    "lhcb collaboration reported two possible candidates for pentaquarks in the @xmath33 channel @xcite , however , the existence of these states is still to be confirmed .",
    "one of the most interesting proposals to detect the narrow @xmath34 pentaquark was made by karliner and rosner in @xcite .",
    "they proposed to measure @xmath2 photoproduction from the proton .",
    "if there is a pentaquark resonance that strongly couples to the @xmath33 channel , it should be possible to detect it in the @xmath35 reaction .",
    "in @xcite we built up a full model for this reaction and analyzed the available experimental data on @xmath33 photoproduction from the proton .",
    "the resonance was introduced as a breit  wigner amplitude and",
    "the background was modeled with a pomeron exchange .",
    "we found that data allow for the existence of a pentaquark whose @xmath33 branching ratio has to be below 30% for spin - parity assignment @xmath36 and below 17% for @xmath37 at a 95% confidence level .",
    "jefferson lab has just approved an experiment to measure this reaction @xcite .",
    "we created an interactive website to make the exchange of information between jpac and other theorists and experimentalist easier @xcite .",
    "the jpac web page at indiana university @xcite hosts downloadable versions of the codes to compute the @xmath38 amplitude from @xcite , the @xmath39 amplitudes from @xcite , the @xmath0 amplitudes employing fesrs from @xcite , the @xmath1 partial waves and observables in the resonance region from @xcite and the high - energy pion photoproduction observables from @xcite .",
    "the codes can also be run on the web page and the outputs downloaded .",
    "codes to compute the generalized veneziano amplitude from @xcite and the double - regge limit for the @xmath30 reaction using the model in @xcite are available upon request . the codes for pentaquark photoproduction @xcite will be available in the near future .",
    "we are currently in the process of building up a mirror of the jpac web page with additional functionalities at universidad nacional autnoma de mxico , hosted at the web servers of instituto de ciencias nucleares @xcite .",
    "the jpac is a theoretical collaboration oriented to work with experimental collaborations and willing to cooperate with other theory groups . at present",
    "we have standing collaborations with besiii , compass , clas , gluex , kloe and lhcb .",
    "we are focused on hadron spectroscopy delivering amplitudes for three - body meson decays @xcite , meson - baryon scattering @xcite , regge phenomenology to gain insight on the internal structure of hadrons @xcite and meson photoproduction @xcite .",
    "codes for the amplitudes are available either from the jpac web page @xcite or upon request .",
    "we invite the hadron physics community to visit the website and send their comments and suggestions to the jpac members .",
    "we thank the division of particles and fields of the mexican physical society for their kind invitation to write this brief report on jpac purpose and recent activities .",
