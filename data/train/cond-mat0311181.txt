    "in the past two decades , a number of novel superconducting materials have been discovered where order parameter symmetries are different from an @xmath1-wave spin singlet , predicted by the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory of electron - phonon mediated pairing . from the initial discoveries of unconventional superconductivity in heavy - fermion compounds ,",
    "the list of examples has now grown to include the high-@xmath2 cuprate superconductors , ruthenates , ferromagnetic superconductors , and possibly organic materials . in most of these materials ,",
    "there are strong indications that the pairing is caused by the electron correlations , in contrast to conventional superconductors such as pb , nb , _ etc_. non - phononic mechanisms of pairing are believed to favor a non - trivial spin structure and orbital symmetry of the cooper pairs .",
    "for example , the order parameter in the high-@xmath2 superconductors , where the pairing is thought to be caused by the anti - ferromagnetic correlations , has the @xmath3-wave symmetry with lines of zeroes at the fermi surface .",
    "a powerful tool of studying unconventional superconducting states is symmetry analysis , which works even if the pairing mechanism is not known .",
    "mathematically , superconductivity is a consequence of the breaking of the gauge symmetry @xmath4 in the full symmetry group of the normal state : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a magnetic space group , which includes usual space group operations ( i.e. translations , rotations , inversion , _ etc _ ) and time reversal operation @xmath7 . in a non - magnetic crystal , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the space group , and @xmath10 . in a magnetic crystal",
    ", @xmath7 enters @xmath6 only in combination with other symmetry elements .",
    "the superconducting state is said to be `` unconventional '' if , in addition to the gauge symmetry , some other symmetries from @xmath11 are broken .",
    "the group - theoretical analysis of unconventional superconducting states in non - magnetic crystals was developed in refs .",
    "recently , it was extended to include the ferromagnetic case @xcite .    in almost all previous studies",
    ", it was assumed that the crystal has an inversion center , which leads to degenerate electron bands and makes it possible to classify the cooper pair states according to their spin ( or pseudospin if the spin - orbit coupling is taken into account ) .",
    "the even ( singlet ) and odd ( triplet ) components of the superconducting order parameter can then be studied separately @xcite . although this is the case in most superconductors ,",
    "there are some exceptions . early discussion of the possible loss of inversion symmetry associated with a structural phase transition in v@xmath0si , which is an a15 type superconductor , can be found in ref .",
    "later , a c15 superconductor hfv@xmath12 was found to undergo a transition from a cubic to a non - centrosymmetric body - centered orthorhombic structure @xcite .",
    "the possible existence of superconductivity was reported in ferroelectric perovskite compounds srtio@xmath0 @xcite and bapbo@xmath0-babio@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "more recently , there has been a renewed theoretical interest in this problem , mainly in the context of superconductivity in two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems , such as cu - o layers in ybco @xcite , or surface superconductivity on tamm levels @xcite . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , in the absence of inversion symmetry the order parameter becomes a mixture of spin - singlet and spin - triplet components , which leads , for instance , to the knight shift attaining a non - zero value at @xmath13 .",
    "other peculiar properties of non - centrosymmetric superconductors include a jump of magnetic induction at the surface @xcite , and the possibility of non - uniform helical superconducting phases due to the presence of first - order gradient terms in the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) functional @xcite .",
    "this work is motivated by a recent experimental discovery of superconductivity with @xmath14 in cept@xmath0si @xcite , which is the first known heavy - fermion material without inversion center .",

    "spatial inversion @xmath25 is not an element of the symmetry group .    in the absence of inversion symmetry , spin - orbit ( so )",
    "coupling plays a crucial role due to its band - splitting effect . at non - zero so coupling ,",
    "the single - particle wavefunctions are linear combinations of the eigenstates of the spin operator @xmath26 : @xmath27 .",
    "since the normal state hamiltonian @xmath28 is invariant with respect to the crystal lattice translations , the eigenfunctions are the bloch spinors @xmath29 belonging to the wave vectors @xmath30 in the brillouin zone , which can be written in the form @xmath31 the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath32 describe the band dispersion of free electrons .    in the presence of both the time - reversal and inversion symmetries the bands are two - fold degenerate at each @xmath30 .",
    "indeed , the states @xmath33 and @xmath34 correspond to the same @xmath30 , have the same energy , and are orthogonal ( in addition , these two states are degenerate with another pair of orthogonal states , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which correspond to @xmath37 ) . in this case ,",
    "@xmath38 , where @xmath39 labels the linearly independent bloch states at a given band index @xmath40 .",
    "there is a freedom in choosing the basis functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the most frequently used convention is that they should transform under rotations @xmath43 similar to the spin eigenstates @xmath44 and @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the spin - rotation matrix : for a rotation by an angle @xmath49 around some axis @xmath50 : @xmath51 $ ] ( @xmath52 are pauli matrices ) .",
    "the practical recipe for constructing the basis of the bloch states is as follows : first choose a state @xmath41 at each @xmath30 in the irreducible part of the first brillouin zone , then act on it by @xmath53 to obtain an orthogonal state @xmath42 at the same @xmath30 , and finally act on @xmath54 by the elements of the point group and use the prescription ( [ pseudospin def ] ) to obtain the pairs of the basis functions belonging to the star of @xmath30 . the single - electron states constructed in this way are referred to as the pseudospin states @xcite .",
    "it is the presence of the inversion center that makes the bands double degenerate in a non - magnetic crystal : @xmath55 at all @xmath30 .",
    "in contrast , if the crystal lacks the inversion symmetry , then the degeneracy of the single - electron bands @xmath56 is lifted everywhere , except from some points or lines of high symmetry .",
    "in particular , the bands always touch at @xmath57 ( the @xmath58 point ) , because of the kramers theorem : time - reversal symmetry means that @xmath33 and @xmath59 have the same energy . in the case of cept@xmath0si",
    ", one can show that the spin - split bands touch along the @xmath60 line ( i.e. along the [ 001 ] direction ) , and there are no other symmetry - imposed degeneracies in the bands crossing the fermi level ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : bands ] below ) . in the limit of zero so coupling ( which is not applicable to cept@xmath0si ) , but still without an inversion center , the symmetry of the system contains @xmath61 spin rotations , in addition to the space group , time reversal , and the gauge group .",
    "then , the bands at each @xmath30 are double degenerate .",
    "let us now show that the transformation properties of the single - electron wave functions in the absence of inversion center are different from those of the spin or pseudospin eigenstates , see eq .",
    "( [ pseudospin def ] ) .",
    "mathematically , the wave functions in each band transform according to irreducible co - representations of the type ii magnetic space group @xmath8 @xcite ( one should use co - representations because the time - reversal operation @xmath7 is anti - unitary ) .",
    "in addition , the co - representations must be double - valued because the states @xmath62 are spin-@xmath63 spinors , so that any rotation by @xmath64 changes their sign : @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and also @xmath67 ( the band index @xmath68 is omitted ) .",
    "the double - valuedness can be dealt with in the standard fashion by using the `` double - group '' trick @xcite : one introduces a fictitious new symmetry element @xmath69 , which commutes with all other elements and satisfies the conditions @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and also @xmath72 .",
    "the co - representations of @xmath6 can be derived from the usual representations of the unitary component , which in our case coincides with the space group @xmath9 . for each @xmath30 in the brillouin zone",
    ", the basis of an irreducible representation of @xmath9 is formed by the bloch states corresponding to the star of @xmath30 .",
    "the state @xmath73 belongs to the wave vector @xmath37 , but the irreducible representations of @xmath9 corresponding to @xmath30 and @xmath37 are inequivalent ( because of the absence of inversion symmetry ) and must therefore be regarded as belonging to a single `` physically irreducible '' representation of twice the dimension @xcite . in terms of co -",
    "representations this means that the bloch states @xmath62 and @xmath73 belong to the same two - dimensional irreducible co - representation of @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "thus , the appropriate basis of the bloch states is formed by the wave functions @xmath75 corresponding to the star of @xmath30 , and also by their time - reversed counterparts @xmath76 , which can be combined in a set of bispinors @xmath77 .",
    "all the states from this set have the same energy : @xmath78 .    since the function @xmath79 belongs to the wave vector @xmath80 , one can write @xmath81 .",
    "the undetermined phase factors come from the freedom in choosing the phases of the bloch states and realize a representation of the point group in this basis ( it is assumed that the bloch states are single - valued and continuous functions throughout the brillouin zone ) . using the commutation of @xmath82 and @xmath7 we have @xmath83|g\\bk\\rangle= \\exp[-i\\varphi_{\\bk}(g)]k|g\\bk\\rangle$ ] .",
    "the co - representation matrices in the basis of bispinor wave functions can be obtained from the relations @xmath84 [ we have taken into account that @xmath85 .",
    "note that the multiplication rules for the co - representation matrices are different from usual unitary group representations .",
    "for example , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , but @xmath88 and @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "the general symmetry arguments given above can be illustrated using an exactly - solvable three - dimensional generalization of the rashba model , which was originally proposed to describe the effects of symmetry lowering near the surface of a semiconductor @xcite and recently applied in refs .",
    "@xcite to quasi-2d non - centrosymmetric superconductors .",
    "consider a single band @xmath90 in a crystal described by the point group @xmath91 . at zero so coupling ,",
    "the band is two - fold degenerate due to spin .",
    "the absence of reflection symmetry in the @xmath92 plane implies the existence of an internal electric field in the crystal , whose average over a unit cell is non - zero . in the rashba approximation , this non - uniform field is replaced by its average , introducing a constant vector @xmath93 .",
    "when a non - zero so coupling is switched on , it can described by an additional term in the hamiltonian : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the @xmath21-axis spin projection , and the states @xmath96 are the bloch spinors at zero so coupling .",
    "diagonalization of the full single - electron hamiltonian , @xmath97 , gives two bands @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) , which satisfy the condition @xmath100 and additional symmetries from the point group .",
    "also , the bands touch along the line @xmath101 .",
    "it is easy to see that one can not use pseudospin to label these bands , because the time reversal @xmath7 transforms the bands into themselves : @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) , while the pseudospin states would be transformed into one another .    to conclude this section",
    ", it should be mentioned that the superconductivity in cept@xmath0si seems to occur in the presence of anti - ferromagnetic ( afm ) order @xcite , although no data have been reported on the structure of the magnetic phase or the magnitude of the staggered moment .",
    "although the symmetry analysis above was done assuming a paramagnetic normal state , our results can be easily generalized for an afm case . for a staggered magnetization directed along the @xmath21 axis , the only change one has to make in the symmetry group is to replace @xmath7 with @xmath104 , which combines the time reversal operation with a lattice translation .",

    ". the terms ( [ fglgrad1 ] ) , which are of the second order in @xmath203 , are present in any multi - band tetragonal superconductor with the order parameter corresponding to a one - dimensional representation of the symmetry group .",
    "however , in the absence of an inversion center , one can have additional terms in the gl functional , which satisfy all the necessary symmetry requirements but are of the first order in gradients @xcite . in our case",
    ", they can be written in the form @xmath204 where @xmath205 is a real anti - symmetric matrix , which is non - zero only if the interband pairing ( [ h2 ] ) is present .",
    "the terms ( [ fglgrad2 ] ) lead to the possibility that the superconducting state which appears immediately below @xmath2 can be non - uniform , even without external magnetic field .",
    "consider for simplicity only two bands participating in superconductivity , i.e. @xmath103 .",
    "in this case , the matrix @xmath206 in eq .",
    "( [ fglgrad2 ] ) has only one non - zero element : @xmath207 .",
    "the critical temperature for the superconducting state @xmath208 is determined by the stability condition of the quadratic terms ( both uniform and gradient ) in the gl functional towards formation of a state with non - zero @xmath209 . from eqs .",
    "( [ fgluniform],[fglgrad1],[fglgrad2 ] ) , one has the following equation for @xmath210 : @xmath211 where @xmath212 and @xmath213 , with @xmath214 and @xmath215 having the meaning of the critical temperatures for the bands 1 and 2 respectively in the absence of any interband coupling .",
    "the phase transition temperature is obtained by the maximization of @xmath210 with respect to @xmath216 .",
    "it is easy to show that the maximum critical temperature corresponds to a state with @xmath217 ( a `` helical '' state @xcite ) if the following condition is satisfied : @xmath218 where @xmath219 .",
    "however , even if this condition is violated and the phase transition occurs from the normal state to a uniform superconducting state , there remains a possibility that this uniform state becomes unstable towards the formation of a helical state at a lower temperature . to find this instability",
    ", one has to include non - linear terms in the free energy .",
    "because of a large number of the phenomenological parameters in the gl functional with the higher - order terms , the phase diagram of this system is quite rich @xcite .",
    "in particular , there exist various types of helical phases with @xmath217 , separated from one another and from the uniform phase by additional phase transitions below @xmath2 .",
    "it should be emphasized that the origin of the helical superconducting states is different from that of the loff non - uniform states @xcite . in terms of the gl functional",
    ", the loff state corresponds to the sign change of the second - order gradient term at some values of the parameters ( e.g. of the external magnetic field ) , while our helical instability occurs because of the presence of the first - order gradient terms .",
    "we have shown that the order parameter in a non - centrosymmetric superconductor with strong spin - orbit coupling has only intra - band components and is always odd with respect to @xmath162 , which is a consequence of pauli principle .",
    "this should be contrasted to the case of zero spin - orbit coupling , in which the bands are two - fold degenerate . in that limit , one can not separate the odd and even components of @xmath152 because of the lack of inversion symmetry , so the order parameter does not have a definite parity .",
    "the fermi surface of cept@xmath0si consists of three pairs of sheets , @xmath128 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 , each split by the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "our band structure calculations reveal that the states at the fermi level are predominantly of ce-4__f _ _ character .",
    "these states are affected strongly by spin - orbit coupling , which leads to the band splitting energy as high as @xmath125 mev .",
    "the splitting vanishes along the @xmath58  _ z _ and _ a _  _ m _ symmetry lines . by far",
    "the biggest contribution to the density of states at the fermi level comes from the @xmath119 sheets .",
    "although the large value of the spin - orbit band splitting excludes the superconducting states that correspond to the pairing of electrons from different sheets of the fermi surface , one can expect that the interband pair scattering will induce gaps of the same symmetry on all sheets of the fermi surface .",
    "possible gap structure of cept@xmath0si depends on the dimensionality of the order parameter .",
    "if the order parameter corresponds to a one - dimensional representation of the group @xmath91 , then the gap has line nodes where the fermi surface crosses the high - symmetry planes or the boundaries of the brillouin zone : at @xmath220 for all 1d representations ; at @xmath221 and @xmath222 for @xmath184 and @xmath185 ; at @xmath189 for @xmath184 and @xmath188 .",
    "the presence of the gap nodes would manifest itself , e.g. in a power - law behavior of thermodynamic and transport characteristics at @xmath223 .",
    "although the gap symmetries on all sheets of the fermi surface should be the same , their magnitudes may be different .",
    "the experimental data , e.g. a reduced value of the specific heat jump at @xmath2 @xcite , indicate that only some parts of the fermi surface have non - zero superconducting gaps , while others remain normal .",
    "if this is indeed the case , then the specific heat would drop as @xmath224 at low temperatures ( with the constant contribution coming from the normal sheets of the fermi surface ) , which seems to agree with the experimental data of ref .",
    "@xcite in zero field .",
    "more detailed information about the pairing symmetry can be obtained only if the precise location of the line nodes is known .",
    "the absence of inversion symmetry can also have interesting consequences for the spatial structure of the superconducting phase .",
    "we showed that , in contrast to the centrosymmetric case , the ginzburg - landau free energy can now contain additional terms which are of the first order in gradients .",
    "such terms can make the superconducting phase unstable towards the formation of a non - uniform ( helical ) state even at zero magnetic field .",
    "for the order parameters corresponding to the one - dimensional representations of @xmath91 , this possibility exists only if the interband pairing is taken into account .",
