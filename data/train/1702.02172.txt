    "rr  lyrae stars are low - mass , horizontal - branch , pulsating variables .",
    "they are divided into three main classes : fundamental mode , radial pulsators ( rrab stars ) , first overtone , radial pulsators ( rrc stars ) and double - mode pulsators , pulsating in the radial fundamental and in the radial first overtone modes simultaneously ( rrd stars ) . in the last few years",
    ", the top - quality photometry of rr  lyr stars gathered by the space telescopes ( _ most _ , _ corot _ and _ kepler _ ) and by the ground - based photometric sky surveys ( e.g. optical gravitational lensing experiment , ogle ) , revolutionized our knowledge about these important variables .",
    "they can no longer be regarded as simple , radial - mode pulsators .",
    "new classes of multi - mode rr  lyr stars , that pulsate simultaneously in radial and non - radial modes , were identified . in particular in rrc and rrd stars ,",
    "additional periodicities that fall in the @xmath6 range were detected ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",

    "as period ratios around 0.61 are the most common , following @xcite we will denote the group as rr@xmath7  and the detected additional frequencies as @xmath8 . in the recently proposed model , @xcite assigns the additional variability with the harmonics of non - radial modes of angular degrees 8 and 9 .",
    "non - radial modes themselves , were also detected in several of these stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* initially interpreted as period - doubling of the additional , @xmath8 frequencies ) .",
    "another , even more puzzling group , was revealed in the ogle photometry of rrc stars . here , additional variability is of period longer than the first overtone period ; too long to be associated with the radial fundamental mode .",
    "the period ratios tightly cluster around @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "peculiar examples of rrd stars were also discovered @xcite ; in particular , @xcite identified a new class of anomalous rrd stars , characterized by anomalous period ratios , in most cases lower than in the `` classical '' rrd stars , by usual domination of the fundamental mode and by common presence of the modulation .",
    "finally , the space photometry collected by _ kepler _ and _ corot _ revolutionized our view on the blazhko effect , a long - term quasi - periodic modulation of pulsation amplitude and/or phase ( for recent reviews see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "although the effect is known for more than a century now , its origin remains a mystery .",

    "the nearly continuous and top - quality photometry enabled a detailed study of the modulation on the cycle - to - cycle basis ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the origin of the blazhko effect or mechanisms behind the excitation of various new forms of the multiperiodic rr  lyr pulsation , remain unclear . to test the existing models ( and to propose the new ones ) , new , top - quality observations are still needed . in particular , it is important to determine how the incidence rates and properties of the various pulsation forms depend on metallicity and on population membership of the stars . in this respect ,",
    "detailed studies of globular cluster variables are crucial , but are very scarce .",
    "the only globular cluster in which dynamical properties of rr  lyr stars were studied in detail is m3 @xcite .",

    "these properties together with a low concentration make it an attractive target for studies with ground based telescopes .",
    "comprehensive ccd observations with 2.5-m du pont and 1-m swope telescopes of the las campanas observatory were performed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it was found that ngc  6362 hosts 35 rr  lyr stars , whose basic parameters were estimated by @xcite ( o01 in the following ) based on fourier decomposition of light curves .",
    "the data analyzed by o01 were collected with the swope telescope during only one observing season , between april 17 and august 22 , 1999 .",
    "@xcite had a much longer time - basis at their disposal , but they were mainly interested in eclipsing binaries , and left the pulsating stars untouched .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the rr  lyr stars of ngc  6362 .",

    "presence and properties of the blazhko effect and excitation of additional pulsation modes , both radial and non - radial , are at the centre of our interests .",
    "our paper is based on two sets of ccd images .",
    "the first one was obtained using the du pont telescope and the 2048@xmath142048 tek5 camera with a field of view of 8.84@xmath148.84 arcmin@xmath15 and a resolution of 0.259 arcsec / pixel .",
    "observations were conducted on 45 nights from april 21 , 1995 to september 26 , 2009 , always with the same filters . altogether , 1748 @xmath16-images were collected .",

    "observations were conducted on 103 nights from july 8 , 1999 to september 9 , 2009 , also keeping the same filters . for the analysis ,",
    "3200 @xmath16-images were used .",
    "since we are interested in the dynamical properties of rr  lyr stars , no transformation to the standard photometric system was made ; we use instrumental magnitudes through the paper .",
    "we refer the interested reader to the study by o01 for the colour - magnitude diagram of the cluster , mean magnitudes and colours of the discussed rr  lyr stars , and their physical properties derived from the @xmath16- and @xmath18-band two - colour photometry through the relations given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our analysis is based primarily on the swope telescope data for two reasons .",
    "first , for a given star they are typically twice as numerous as the data collected with the du pont telescope .",
    "second , data gathered with the du pont telescope are of inferior quality as compared to the data gathered with the swope telescope",
    ". specifically , dispersion of the residuals of the fourier fit to the du pont data is always higher , by at least 40 per cent . as a consequence , when merging the swope and the du pont data the noise level in the fourier transform increases , making the detection of weak , secondary periodicities more difficult .",
    "lower quality of the du pont data might be due to different reduction procedures adopted for the two telescopes : isis package of @xcite was used for the du pont data and diapl package written by w.  pych was used for the swope data .",
    "data from both telescopes were used together only to study period changes of rr  lyr variables .",
    "inclusion of du pont data allowed us to add a few additional points to the phase - change ( o  c ) diagrams .",

    "the number of observations vary from season to season .",
    "the most extensive observations were gathered in s1 ( typically @xmath19 data points ) , then in s3 ( @xmath20 data points ) and s8 ( @xmath21 data points ) .",
    "data collected in other seasons are less numerous ( between @xmath22 and @xmath23 data points ) .",
    "the data structure is nearly the same for all rr  lyr stars observed .",
    "the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] illustrate the spectral window for data displayed in the top panel .",
    "both daily and 1-yr aliases are very prominent and may become a source of confusion during the analysis .",
    "our data analysis follows the standard consecutive prewhitening technique .",
    "significant periodicities are identified with the help of the discrete fourier transform and included in the sine series of the following form :    @xmath24    which is fitted to the data with the help of non - linear least - square method .",
    "amplitudes , phases and frequencies are all adjusted during the procedure .",
    "prewhitened data are inspected for the presence of additional , lower - amplitude periodicities , which are iteratively included in eq .",
    "we accept as significant periodicities with signal - to - noise ( s / n ) above 4 ; the ratio is determined from the frequency spectrum , with the noise evaluated as a mean amplitude of the fourier transform in the @xmath25c / d range . to account for the possible season - to - season zero - point differences ,",
    "ten independent offset coefficients are determined during the procedure , by minimizing the dispersion of the fit ( the offsets are typically below @xmath26mmag ) .",
    "once the solution converges ( no new significant signals are detected ) , severe outliers are removed from the data ( 5@xmath27 clipping ) .    in eq .",
    "we include a few independent frequencies only .",
    "the sine series describing a typical solution contains pulsation frequency , @xmath28 , and its harmonics , @xmath29 ( below , we will use @xmath30 and @xmath31 for the fundamental mode and the first overtone frequency , respectively ; at the moment , there is no need to differentiate the two ) . for the single - periodic and non - modulated star ,",
    "these are the only terms in eq .",
    "[ eq ] , which reduces to a finite order fourier series . quite often , however , we detect modulation of pulsation ( the blazhko effect ) or multiperiodic pulsation ( or sometimes both ) . in the frequency spectrum ,",
    "the modulation manifests as equally spaced multiplets centred at the frequency of the radial mode and its harmonics .",
    "hence , only one independent frequency , modulation frequency , @xmath32 , is added to the solution .",
    "components of the multiplet are then described as @xmath33 .",
    "modulation period is simply @xmath34 .",
    "frequencies of additional periodicities , related to e.g. additional radial / non - radial pulsation modes are denoted as @xmath35 .",
    "linear combinations with the dominant radial pulsation frequency , typically of the form @xmath36 , are often detected and included in the solution .",
    "slow phase and/or amplitude changes may occur in rr  lyr stars ; in fact they are rather common in the rrc variables .",
    "phase changes are usually most pronounced and often of irregular nature . as a result ,",
    "the peaks detected at the radial mode frequency ( and harmonics ) are non - coherent and a residual unresolved power remains in the frequency spectrum after prewhitening .",
    "the resulting , increased noise level in the fourier transform may hamper the detection of additional , low - amplitude periodicities . to circumvent the problem ,",
    "two techniques were applied . in the first one , we simply focus on a short part of the data , either corresponding to the first season , s1 , or to the first four seasons , s1-s4 . on a shorter time",
    "scale , the phase changes are not that disruptive .",
    "the second technique we apply is a time - dependent prewhitening .",
    "the details of the method and its application to quasi - continuous _ kepler _ data are discussed in @xcite , the appendix . in @xcite the technique",
    "was applied to seasonal , ground - based data and here we follow the same approach . in a nutshell ,",
    "the data are first divided into seasons , and amplitudes and phases are determined for each season separately .",
    "then , the data are prewhitened with the sine series of the form displayed in eq .",
    "[ eq ] , except that amplitudes and phases are now season - dependent .",
    "the procedure filters out possible amplitude / phase variations on a time scale longer than the typical length of the observing season .",
    "the frequency spectrum is cleaned from the unresolved power and the overall noise level drops , enabling detection of additional low - amplitude periodicities .",
    "because of scarce data in some of the observing seasons , the technique can in most cases be applied to five seasons only ( s1 , s3 , s4 , s7 and s8 ) .    whenever these techniques appeared crucial for the detection of additional phenomena ( modulation , additional periodicities ) we explicitly state so while discussing a given star .",
    "we have analysed photometric data for 35 pulsators from ngc  6362 , all of which were identified as rr  lyr stars in the study of o01 and earlier studies of the cluster summarized there . of these",
    ", 18 were classified as rrab and 17 as rrc variables . for the majority of stars we confirm the classification of o01 , with the exception of v3 , v34 and v37 . in the first two stars , previously classified as rrab",
    ", we detect the first overtone , and now classify them as rrd variables ; in fact they are new members of the anomalous rrd class identified recently by @xcite , as we discuss in detail in section  [ ssect : anrrd ] . in addition ,",
    "v37 , classified by o01 as rrc , is discussed separately in our study ( section  [ ssect : v37 ] ) .",
    "most likely , v37 is not rr  lyr star , but a pulsating variable of different nature .",
    "the basic properties of 16 rrab and 16 rrc variables are collected in tab .",
    "[ tab : abc ] ( which also contains data on v37 in the last row ) .",
    "these include pulsation period and pulsation amplitude as well as information about additional phenomena detected in the stars ( the last column ) .",
    "the phenomena are : blazhko modulation ( ` bl ' in the last column ) , double - periodic blazhko modulation ( ` 2@xmath14bl ' ) and the presence of the additional , non - radial pulsation ( ` nr ' ) .",
    "all 11 seasons of swope data were used to derive pulsation periods and amplitudes given in tab .  [ tab : abc ] and hence , these quantities are means over the time span of the observations .",
    "this comment is particularly relevant for the rrc stars , where we often detect fast and irregular period changes ( see section  [ ssect : rrc ] ) .",
    ".basic properties of the analysed rrab and rrc variables : star s i d , type , pulsation period and fourier amplitude , i.e. @xmath37 from eq . 1 at the fundamental / first overtone frequency .",
    "all numbers are given to the last significant digit .",
    "in the last column remarks are given : ` bl '  blazhko effect detected , ` 2@xmath14bl ' ",
    "double - periodic blazhko effect detected , ` nr '  non - radial mode(s ) detected .",
    "properties of the two rrd stars are listed separately in tab .",
    "[ tab : d ] . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we stress that the reported high incidence rate of the blazhko phenomenon results not only from the top quality of the data we analyse and consequently the low detection threshold in the mmag range .",
    "in fact , modulation is easily detected because of large modulation amplitudes .",
    "the amplitude of the dominant modulation side peak in the vicinity of the radial mode frequency is at least @xmath38mmag for rrc stars and at least @xmath39mmag for rrab stars .",
    "although the detection of @xmath38mmag signals is indeed challenging in typical ground based data , identifying signals at the level of @xmath39mmag is rather routine in the data of massive sky surveys ( see e.g. analysis of ogle - iii data by * ? ? ?",
    "the relative modulation amplitudes for rrab stars range from @xmath40 to @xmath41per cent and for rrc stars from @xmath42 to @xmath43per cent .",
    "all modulation periods are below @xmath44d with the exception of the second modulation period detected in v30 , which is @xmath45d .",
    "v30 is the only rrab star in which two modulation periods were detected .",
    "two modulation periods were also detected in rrc variable , v6 , but the secondary modulation is very weak .",
    "@xcite noted , based on the analysis of the _ kepler _ sample , that the ratio between the primary and secondary modulation periods is nearly always close to a small integer number .",
    "we note that the two modulation periods in v30 and v6 are not in a resonant or close - to - resonant ratio as @xmath46 is @xmath47 for v30 and @xmath48 for v6 .    in the colour - magnitude diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd ] ) we marked the blazhko variables with thick symbols .",
    "two of the three modulated rrc stars , v6 and v10 , are among the hottest rrc stars of ngc  6362 .",
    "v36 on the other hand , in which the blazhko modulation is weak ( only one modulation side peak was detected ) , is the coolest rrc star in the sample .",
    "the majority of rrab stars show the blazhko effect ; they are scattered over the entire domain of rrab stars in the diagram .",
    "the only two rrd variables we identified in ngc  6362 show modulation of the radial modes , which is characteristic for anomalous rrd stars",
    ". incidence rate of the blazhko effect among m3 double - mode variables is 45 per cent ; 4 modulated rrd stars of m3 also have anomalous period ratios @xcite ; see next section for more details .",
    "finally , we note that in some of the blazhko variables , the phase coverage of the modulation cycle is very good , and the blazhko effect itself appears regular .",
    "it allows to visualise the light curve changes over the blazhko cycle in the form of an animation .",
    "such animations for v5 , v31 ( rrab ) and v10 ( rrc ) are available as a supplementary on - line material .",
    "data for these stars were phased with the modulation period , divided into ten phase bins , and phased with the pulsation period within each bin .",
    "[ fig : animv10 ] illustrates the light curve changes in v10 .",
    "both amplitude and phase modulation are apparent . at phases of lower pulsation amplitude ( @xmath49 )",
    "the light curve is essentially featureless .",
    "as pulsation amplitude gets higher , the shoulder ( or bump ) appears on the ascending branch , just before the maximum brightness .",
    "recently , the new class of multiperiodic rr  lyr pulsators was identified : anomalous rrd stars @xcite . in these variables ,",
    "two radial modes , fundamental and first overtone , are involved in the pulsation , but otherwise properties of these stars are anomalous , as compared to `` classical '' rrd stars . the first objects of this type were discovered in the galactic bulge @xcite and in the globular cluster m3 @xcite . only recently additional objects were detected in the ogle magellanic clouds photometry by @xcite , who proposed to call these stars anomalous rrd , based on their distinct characteristics .",
    "location of these stars in the petersen diagram does not follow the well defined progression delineated by `` classical '' rrd stars ; their period ratios are significantly different than in the classical rrd stars at the same fundamental mode period",
    ". typically , the period ratios are smaller .",
    "this is well illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : petrrd ] .",
    "contrary to `` classical '' rrd stars it is the fundamental mode that most often dominates the pulsation .",
    "finally , a long - term modulation of pulsation of one , or of both radial modes is often detected in anomalous rrd stars .",
    "@xcite also noted a somewhat peculiar light curve shape of the dominant fundamental mode variation .",
    "the two rrd stars newly detected in ngc  6362 , v3 and v34 , clearly belong the class of anomalous rrd stars , as they share the same characteristics .",
    "their period ratios are lower than expected at a given fundamental mode period . in both stars",
    "it is the fundamental mode that dominates the pulsation .",
    "finally , a modulation of the radial modes is firmly detected in both v3 and v34 .",
    "it is important to note that anomalous rrd stars are not a homogeneous group .",
    "although all reported stars share the same broad characteristics ( e.g. anomalous period ratios , modulation ) , some systematic differences can be easily pointed out while analysing stars of different stellar systems .",
    "contrary to classical rrd stars , the fundamental mode usually has a larger amplitude than the first overtone . in the magellanic clouds it is the case for 19 out of 22 stars , which is 86 per cent of the sample",
    "( see tab .  1 in * ?",
    "* ) . in m3 ,",
    "in three out of four anomalous rrd stars the fundamental mode dominates ( @xmath50 per cent ; * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly , the only star in which the first overtone dominates the pulsation ( v99 ) has a higher period ratio than the classical rrd stars . in the galactic bulge , only in 7 out of 15 stars reported by @xcite the fundamental mode dominates , which constitutes @xmath51 per cent of the sample .",
    "still , this number is higher than in the population of classical rrd stars in the same stellar system , where it is only @xmath52 per cent .",
    "further , if we exclude a few stars with larger period ratios , in @xmath53 per cent of anomalous rrd stars of the galactic bulge the fundamental mode dominates . in the only two anomalous rrd stars of ngc  6362 , the fundamental mode strongly dominates .",
    "in fact , the amplitude ratios , @xmath54 and @xmath55 per cent in v3 and v34 , respectively , are the smallest reported for anomalous rrd stars .",
    "further differences are noticed in the modulation properties of rrd stars with anomalous period ratios , most notably in the asymmetry of modulation side peaks . in the modulated stars of the magellanic clouds in all but one star , the modulation side peaks on the lower frequency side of the radial mode are higher ( see tab .  2 in * ? ? ?",
    "relevant information is also available for the galactic bulge stars , in which there is no clear tendency : side peaks on either side of the radial mode frequency can be higher ( see tab .  2 in * ? ? ?",
    "in the two rrd stars of ngc  6362 the modulation side peaks on higher frequency side of the radial mode dominate or are the only side peaks detected .",
    "a study of systematic differences between anomalous rrd stars of different stellar systems is important for testing the models explaining the origin of this peculiar form of pulsation .",
    "so far , only one mechanism was proposed .",
    "based on linear pulsation models , @xcite pointed out that anomalous rrd pulsation might be related to the parametric resonance of the form : @xmath56 . in this scenario ,",
    "a low damping rate of the fundamental mode is needed to explain its typically higher amplitude , as fundamental mode is a _ daughter mode _ , gaining energy at the cost of the first overtone .",
    "a modulation of pulsation amplitude and phase is also , in principle , possible in this resonance scenario .",
    "nevertheless , to validate the proposed mechanism , and to provide any predictions that could be compared with observations , non - linear model computations are needed .",
    "_ earlier detections .",
    "_ detection of non - radial modes was claimed in the observations of globular cluster m55 @xcite , and in ngc  6362 ( o01 ) .",
    "o01 lists three stars as showing non - radial pulsations : v6 , v10 and v37 .",
    "v37 is very peculiar object and we discussed it in detail in section  [ ssect : v37 ] .",
    "now we focus on v6 and v10 .",
    "the suspected non - radial modes were identified by o01 based on the frequency spectrum analysis , as peaks close to the radial mode frequency . in v6 and v10 two close peaks , symmetrically placed around the radial mode frequency , were detected .",
    "such peaks , forming equidistant triplet with the radial mode frequency , might also appear as due to modulation of pulsation , i.e. the blazhko effect . for these stars , the corresponding modulation periods would be @xmath57d and @xmath58d , for v6 and v10 , respectively .",
    "because at that time the known blazhko rrc stars were scarce and all blazhko rrc stars reported in the literature had longer modulation periods , o01 interpreted the additional periodicities as due to non - radial pulsation .",

    "the non - radial modes are split due to star s rotation and form a symmetric triplet with the radial mode frequency @xcite .",

    "these observations can not be explained by clock - work models , like that of @xcite .",
    "in addition , the close peaks seen in the frequency spectrum appear to be parts of multiplet structures which are a signature of genuine modulation . due to the poor quality of the observations",
    "only one or two components of the multiplet were detected in the past .",
    "several examples can be given for ngc  6362 .",
    "when results of o01 and of the present analysis are compared , we commonly detect triplets ( v7 , v18 , v30 , v31 , v32 ) , full quintuplets or components of quintuplet structure ( v1 , v5 , v29 , v6 , v10 ) or even septuplet components ( v13 ) in place of a single close peak detected in the earlier study of o01 .",

    "we note that @xmath8 peaks are also detected in the first overtone cepheids ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the distribution of period ratios of stars showing the @xmath8 peaks with and without subharmonics , both in cepheids and in rr  lyr stars , strongly supports dziembowski s model @xcite .",
    "we do not detect subharmonics in rr@xmath7  stars of ngc  6362 . in one star , v17",
    ", we detect periodicities that correspond to the three sequences in the petersen diagram ( see tab .  [ tab:61 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:61freq ] ) .",
    "the ` middle periodicity ' should correspond to the combination frequency then . in fig .",
    "[ fig:61freq ] , we indicate were the combination frequency is expected ( arrow marked with ` c ' label ) , based on the frequencies of the highest peaks corresponding to the bottom and top sequences ( marked with left - most and right - most arrows in the same panel ; @xmath70 and @xmath71 according to the dziembowski s model ) .",
    "it indeed falls very close to the location of the highest peak corresponding to the middle sequence in the petersen diagram .",
    "although the agreement is not perfect , it is satisfactory , taking into account the complex appearance of the @xmath8 peaks and consequently , intrinsic difficulty in precise determination of their frequency .",
    "we note that all other known rrc / rrd stars with periodicities corresponding to the three sequences in the petersen diagram pass this test ( dziembowski & smolec , in prep . ) .",
    "_ properties of rr@xmath7  stars in the globular clusters . _ a large fraction of rrc stars in the globular cluster m3 , @xmath72per cent ( 14 out of 37 rrc ) , are rr@xmath7  stars .",
    "in addition , in 4 out 10 rrd stars ( @xmath73per cent ) @xmath8 peaks were detected @xcite .",
    "one of these rrd stars is anomalous .",
    "the incidence rate is even higher among rrc stars of ngc  6362 as in 10 out of 16 rrc stars ( @xmath2per cent ) we detect @xmath8 peaks .",
    "it is the highest incidence rate in the published ground - based observations . in the petersen diagram ,",
    "[ fig : pet61 ] , ngc  6362 variables nicely fit the three sequences formed by the previously discovered objects , majority of which are galactic bulge stars .",
    "the only exception is v8 for which period ratio is low , @xmath74 ( tab .",
    "[ tab:61 ] ) ; still a few objects with similar period ratios were reported in the literature and are included in fig .",
    "[ fig : pet61 ] . in all but two stars",
    "we detect only a single additional periodicity that falls within the bottom sequence in the petersen diagram . in v33 two additional periodicities",
    "are detected , and they correspond to the bottom and to the top sequence in the petersen diagram . in v17",
    "three periodicities are detected that nicely fit to the three sequences delineated by the ogle galactic bulge stars .",
    "a systematic difference with m3 stars is apparent .",
    "first , rr@xmath7  stars of m3 are shifted towards longer periods .",
    "the shift is consistent with the difference of average rrc periods in both clusters , which is @xmath75d .",
    "the scatter among rr@xmath7  stars of m3 seems larger ; their mean period ratio is also slightly higher than that derived from the galactic bulge sample . in fact , the galactic bulge rr@xmath7  stars are scarce at first overtone periods characteristic for m3 rr@xmath7  stars .",
    "only six rr@xmath7  stars were identified in @xmath63  cen @xcite .",
    "four of them have first overtone periods longer than typically observed for rr@xmath7  stars of m3 and of ngc  6362 .",
    "two have shorter periods , one within the range typical for m3 stars , and the other within a range typical for ngc  6362 stars . in general , rr@xmath7  stars of @xmath63  cen are strongly scattered over the petersen diagram .     range . ]",
    "the described differences in the distribution of rr@xmath7  stars of the three globular clusters in the petersen diagram must reflect the metallicity and population differences between the three clusters . both m3 and ngc  6362 are ooi , but their mean metallicities differ , @xmath11}=-1.57 $ ] and @xmath11}=-0.95 $ ] , for m3 and ngc  6362 , respectively .",
    "also , m3 has been assigned to a young , while ngc  6362 to an old halo population @xcite ( although the isochrone fitting yields the same age for both systems * ? ? ?",
    "the metallicity difference alone can not explain the observed period shift between rr@xmath7  stars of the two clusters .",
    "@xmath63  cen , on the other hand , is a very large and atypical globular cluster .",
    "it is classified as ooii type and its mean metallicity ( @xmath10}=-1.62 $ ] ) is similar to m3 , but it is known to host diverse stellar populations and might be a remnant of the dwarf galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it explains why its rr@xmath7  stars are scattered over the petersen diagram ; long periods of its four rr@xmath7  stars are consistent with its ooii designation .    based on their analysis , @xcite pointed out two interesting properties of rr@xmath7  variables , which we can check for ngc  6362 stars .",
    "first , they noted , the rr@xmath7  stars are located in the colour - magnitude diagram ( see their fig .",
    "3 ) in the region directly adjacent to the rrd domain ( to its blue side ; we note that @xmath8 peaks were also detected in rrd stars in their study ) . in the colour magnitude - diagram plotted in our fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd ] , we marked the rr@xmath7  stars with the plus sign .",
    "it is hard to define the rrd domain in this plot , as we have only two anomalous rrd stars in our sample .",
    "however , the interface between rrab and rrc stars is clearly marked .",
    "no doubt , the rr@xmath7  stars concentrate on the blue side of this interface .",
    "we thus confirm the observation made by @xcite .",
    "second , analysing the light curves and corresponding fourier decomposition parameters for rrc stars with and without @xmath8 peaks , @xcite concluded ( see their fig .  4 ) , that light curves of rr@xmath7  stars are `` sinusoidal , with a reduced , if any , bump preceding maximum brightness '' . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fpc ] we plot the low - order fourier decomposition parameters for rrc stars and mark the rr@xmath7  stars with plus sign .",
    "contrary to @xcite , we observe that there is no difference between @xmath76 and @xmath77 of rr@xmath7  stars and other rrc stars .",
    "also , a glimpse at fig .  [ fig : lc_rrc ] indicates that the bump preceding maximum brightness is commonly present in rr@xmath7  stars of ngc  6362 ( e.g. in v23 , v27 , v15 , v21 ) .",
    "we conclude that there is no specific feature of the light curve that distinguishes the rr@xmath7  phenomenon in general .",
    "we do not detect subharmonics in rr@xmath7  stars of ngc  6362 .",
    "subharmonics were not detected in m3 either .",
    "@xcite detected @xmath8 peaks in 4 rrd variables , including one anomalous star .",
    "we find no trace of @xmath8 peaks in the only two , anomalous rrd stars of ngc  6362 .",
    "_ gravity modes in rrc stars ? _ in two rrc variables we have detected additional long - period variability ; too slow to be associated with an acoustic mode of oscillation . on the other hand ,",
    "additional periods are too short to be connected with rotation or with binarity effects .",
    "if these periodicities are intrinsic to the stars , they would correspond to non - radial , gravity mode pulsation .",
    "detection of long - period additional variability in the rrc stars was also reported in the analysis of top - quality _ kepler _ observations , see section  6 in @xcite . we stress that possible detection of gravity modes in giant - type stars represents a challenge to stellar pulsation theory @xcite .    in the case of v8 and v35 ( see section  [ ssect : notesrrc ] ) the additional variability is in the mmag regime . in no case",
    "we have detected combination frequencies with the dominant radial oscillation , so we have no proof that additional periodicities are intrinsic to these stars .",
    "contamination is likely in the dense fields of globular cluster .",
    "consequently , we refrain from any definite statements on the nature of additional long - period variabilities in the discussed stars .",
    "we have analysed top - quality photometric data gathered for 35 rr  lyr stars in the globular cluster ngc  6362 within the case project .",
    "our most important findings are the following .    *",
    "sixteen of the analysed stars are genuine rrab stars and other 16 are genuine rrc stars , in agreement with earlier studies of rr  lyr stars in ngc  6362 . *",
    "two stars previously classified as rrab , v3 and v34 , are anomalous rrd stars , members of the recently identified class of double - mode pulsators .",
    "in addition to the radial fundamental mode we detect the radial first overtone of low amplitude . period ratio of the two radial modes is significantly lower than for the majority of ` classical ' rrd stars at the same fundamental mode period . in both stars , either both radial modes are modulated ( v3 ) , or only one of the modes is modulated .",
    "previously , anomalous rrd stars were identified in the galactic bulge , the magellanic clouds and in the globular cluster m3 .",
    "* v37 , previously classified as rrc , shows beating of two close and large amplitude periodicities .",
    "the presence of combination frequencies in the flux data confirms that both are intrinsic to the star .",
    "surprisingly , lower amplitude periodicity is more nonlinear ; its characteristic shape , with short ascending branch and long descending branch , suggest that it is due to pulsation in the radial fundamental mode .",
    "the light curve corresponding to the dominant variability is more symmetric ; a weak modulation of this signal was also detected .",
    "both light curves significantly differ from the shape typical for rrc stars .",
    "its rr  lyr classification is thus tentative ; however , we can not propose other satisfactory explanation of its nature .",
    "we note that the star is a genuine proper - motion member of the cluster and its brightness is typical for horizontal branch stars in ngc  6362 . *",
    "ten out of 16 rrc stars show additional periodicities in the @xmath3 range .",
    "these double - periodic variables , abbreviated here as rr@xmath7 , are well known ; in fact , based on space observations , it is expected that this form of pulsation must be common among rrc / rrd stars .",
    "the incidence rate in ngc  6362 , @xmath2per cent , is the highest in ground - based observations published so far .",
    "properties of rr@xmath7  stars in ngc  6362 are qualitatively similar to properties of rr@xmath7  stars in the galactic bulge ; in particular their location in the petersen diagram is very similar .",
    "rr@xmath7   stars of ngc  6362 fall within the three sequences formed by the galactic bulge stars .",
    "systematic differences are noted when rr@xmath7  stars of ngc  6362 are compared with rr@xmath7  stars of other globular clusters , m3 and @xmath63  centauri .",
    "numerous populations of rr@xmath7  stars in different stellar systems are essential for testing the models which try to explain the nature of rr@xmath7  stars . *",
    "our results support the observation made by @xcite in m3 : rr@xmath7  stars tend to cluster on the cool side of the rrc domain , at the interface with rrab domain , where rrd pulsation is also expected .",
    "* incidence rate of the blazhko effect is among the highest reported in the ground - based observations .",
    "we detect modulation in 11 out of 16 rrab stars ( @xmath4per cent ) and in 3 out of 16 rrc stars ( @xmath5per cent ) .",
    "in addition , one rrc star and one rrab star are rare examples of stars in which two modulation periods are detected . * rrc stars are prone to phase instabilities .",
    "these rarely correspond to steady period increase / decrease , but in the majority of cases have complex nonlinear appearance and occur on time scales much shorter than expected due to evolution .",
    "in contrast , majority of rrab stars have stable pulsation periods over the time span of the observations .",
