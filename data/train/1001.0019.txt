    "unstable configurations are likely not to be realizable in practice , and represent an intermediate stage in the evolution of the system . nevertheless , the instability itself is of great interest , since an understanding of the mechanism behind it may help one to better grasp the physics involved . in particular , it is of interest to be able to predict which other systems display similar instabilities , or even have a deeper understanding of the physics behind the instability ( why is the system unstable ?",

    "kerr black holes are stable , and can therefore describe astrophysical objects . however , there are many instances of instabilities afflicting objects with an event horizon , such as the gregory - laflamme @xcite , the ultra - spinning @xcite or superradiant instabilities @xcite and other instabilities of higher - dimensional black holes in alternative theories @xcite(for a review see ref .",
