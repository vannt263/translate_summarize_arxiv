    "thermal , surface emission from neutron stars ( nss ) has the potential of providing invaluable information on the physical properties and evolution of nss ( equation of state at super - nuclear densities , cooling history , magnetic field , surface composition , different populations ; see , e.g. , yakovlev & pethick 2004 ; harding & lai 2006 ) . with x - ray telescope such as _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ , the last decade has seen significant observational progress , revealing the surface magnetic field geometry of isolated pulsars with phase - resolved spectroscopy , and constraining the cooling physics from thermal emission of young nss in supernova remnants ( e.g. , kaspi et al .",
    "in addition , thermal emission from seven isolated , radio - quiet nss has been studied in detail , revealing absorption features in their spectra in many cases ( see , e.g. , van kerkwijk & kaplan 2007 ; kaplan 2008 ) .",
    "it has been recognized that in addition to imaging , timing and spectroscopy , x - ray polarimetry provides a new way to study many high - energy astrophysical sources , particularly magnetic nss .",
    "recent advances in detector technology suggest that polarimetry study of x - ray sources holds great promise in the future ( e.g. , costa et al .",
    "2008 ; swank et al .",
    "2008 ) .    the surface emission from magnetized nss ( with @xmath0 g )",
    "is highly polarized ( e.g. , gnedin & sunyaev 1974 ; meszaros et al .  1988 ;",
    "pavlov & zavlin 2000 ) for the following reason . in the magnetized plasma that characterizes ns atmospheres ,",
    "x - ray photons propagate in two normal modes : the ordinary mode ( o - mode , or @xmath1-mode ) is mostly polarized parallel to the @xmath2-@xmath3 plane , while the extraordinary mode ( x - mode , or @xmath4-mode ) is mostly polarized perpendicular to the @xmath2-@xmath3 plane , where @xmath2 is the photon wave vector and @xmath3 is the external magnetic field ( e.g. , meszaros 1992 ) .",
    "this description of normal modes applies under typical conditions , when the photon energy @xmath5 is much less than the electron cyclotron energy @xmath6kev [ where @xmath7 , @xmath5 is not too close to the ion cyclotron energy @xmath8ev ( where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the charge number and mass number of the ion ) , the plasma density is not too close to the vacuum resonance ( see below ) and @xmath11 ( the angle between @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) is not close to zero . under these conditions , the x - mode opacity ( due to scattering and absorption )",
    "is greatly suppressed compared to the o - mode opacity , @xmath12 ( e.g. lodenquai et al .",
    "1974 ; meszaros 1992 ; potekhin & chabrier 2003 ) . as a result ,",
    "the x - mode photons escape from deeper , hotter layers of the ns atmosphere than the o - mode photons , and the emergent radiation is linearly polarized to a high degree ( e.g. , pavlov & zavlin 2000 ; ho & lai 2001,2003 ; van adelsberg & lai 2006 ) .",
    "measurements of x - ray polarization , particularly when phase - resolved and measured in different energy bands , could provide unique constraints on the ns magnetic field strength and geometry .",
    "it has long been predicted from quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) that in a strong magnetic field the vacuum becomes birefringent ( e.g. , schwinger 1951 ; adler 1971 ) .",
    "while this vacuum polarization effect makes the photon index of refraction deviate from unity only when @xmath13 , where @xmath14 g is the critical qed field strength , it can significantly affect the spectra of polarization signals from magnetic nss in more subtle way , at much lower field strengths ( see section 2 of lai & ho 2003a for a qualitative explanation ) . in particular , the combined effects of vacuum polarization and magnetized plasma gives rise to a `` vacuum resonance '' , at which the contributions from these two effects ( plasma and vacuum polarization ) to the dielectric tensor `` compensate '' each other ( gnedin et al .",
    "1978 ; meszaros & ventura 1979 ; pavlov & gnedin 1984 ; lai & ho 2002 ) .",
    "a photon may convert from the high - opacity mode to the low - opacity one and vice verse when it crosses the vacuum resonance region in the inhomogeneous ns atmosphere . for @xmath15 g",
    ", this vacuum resonance phenomenon tends to soften the hard spectral tail due to the non - greyness of the atmospheric opacities and suppress the width of absorption lines , while for @xmath16 g , the spectrum is unaffected ( see lai & ho 2002,2003a ; ho & lai 2003 ; van adelsberg & lai 2006 ) .    the qed - induced vacuum birefringence influences the x - ray polarization signals from magnetic nss in two different ways . ( i ) _ photon mode conversion in the ns atmosphere : _ since the mode conversion depends on photon energy and magnetic field strength , this vacuum resonance effect gives rise to a unique energy - dependent polarization signal in x - rays : for `` normal '' field strengths ( @xmath17 g ) , the plane of linear polarization at the photon energy @xmath18kev is perpendicular to that at @xmath19kev , while for `` superstrong '' field strengths ( @xmath20 g ) , the polarization planes at different energies coincide ( lai & ho 2003b ; van adelsberg & lai 2006 ) .",
    "( ii ) _ polarization mode decoupling in the magnetosphere : _ the birefringence of the magnetized qed vacuum decouples the photon polarization modes , so that as a polarized photon leaves the ns surface and propagates through the magnetosphere , its polarization direction follows the direction of the magnetic field up to a large radius ( the so - called polarization limiting radius ) .",
    "the result is that although the magnetic field orientations over the ns surface may vary widely , the polarization directions of the photon originating from different surface regions tend to align , giving rise to large observed polarization signals ( heyl & shaviv 2002 ; van adelsberg & lai 2006 ) .    in this paper",
    "we examine in detail the photon polarization evolution in the magnetized qed vacuum of a ns magnetosphere [ effect ( ii ) in the last paragraph ] .",
    "we are particularly interested in photon propagation across the _ quasi - tangential _ region ( qt region ) : as the photon travels through the magnetosphere , it may cross the region where its wave vector is aligned or nearly aligned with the magnetic field ( i.e. , @xmath11 is zero or small ) . in such a qt region ,",
    "the two photon modes ( @xmath1 and @xmath4 modes ) become ( nearly ) identical , and mode coupling may occur , thereby affecting the polarization alignment .",
    "our previous analytical ( or semi - analytical ) treatment of the alignment effect ( lai & ho 2003b ; van adelsberg & lai 2006 ) focused on the region far away from the ns surface , thus did not not include the qt region ( which typically lies within a few stellar radii ) .",
    "the numerical ray integration presented in heyl & shaviv ( 2002 ; see also heyl et al .",
    "2003 ) should in principle have included such qt region , but no systematic characterization of the qt propagation effect on the final photon polarization was attempted there . as we show in this paper , polarization evolution through the qt region is sufficiently subtle ( e.g. the effect varies on small length scales across the emission region ) that a careful examination of its effect is necessary .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the evolution of high - energy ( x - ray ) photon polarization in ns magnetospheres and to quantitatively assess the qt propagation effect .",
    "the remainder of our paper is organized as follows : section 2 summarizes the basic equations for studying photon polarization evolution in magnetized qed vacuum . in section 3",
    "we examine the general behavior of the polarization evolution across a qt region in a generic magnetic geometry . in section 4",
    "we present detailed calculations in the case of dipole magnetic field and consider emissions from both the polar cap and the other regions of the ns surface .",
    "we provide a simple prescription ( see section 4.3 ) for including the qt effect in the calculations of the observed polarization signals . in section 5",
    "we discuss the implications of our results for the x - ray polarization signals from magnetic nss and the prospect of using x - ray polarimetry to probe strong - field qed .",
    "the magnetospheres of pulsars and magnetars consist of relativistic electron - positron pairs streaming along magnetic field lines .",

    "[ fig:1d_theta_mu5_diffthetar ] ) , @xmath110 is always less that 3 .",
    "the reason is that when @xmath267 is large , the qt point lies far away from the star @xmath272 ( and it is even possible that @xmath273 for sufficiently large @xmath267 ) . in this case",
    "( small @xmath144 and emission from the region far away from the magnetic pole ) , the simple prescription we have presented in section 4.2    4.3 to account for the qt effect can not be used , and numerical ray integration from each emission point is necessary .",

    "one need to know the intensities of the two photon modes at emission , @xmath164 and @xmath163 . in the case of thermal emission , these can be obtained directly from atmosphere / surface models .",
    "as the radiation propagates through the magnetosphere , the photon mode evolves adiabatically , following the variation of the magnetic field , until the polarization limiting radius @xmath154 , at which point the polarization is frozen .",
    "thus the polarized radiation flux beyond @xmath154 is @xmath275 , and @xmath276 is not exactly zero because of the neutron star rotation and because mode recoupling does not occur instantly at @xmath154 ; see van adelsberg & lai ( 2006 ) . ] , where @xmath277 is the distance of the source , @xmath205 and @xmath278 are defined in the coordinate system such that the stellar magnetic field at @xmath154 lies in the @xmath98 plane ( with the @xmath9-axis pointing towards the observer ) .",
    "since @xmath154 is much larger than the stellar radius , the magnetic fields as `` seen '' by different photon rays are aligned and are determined by the dipole component of the stellar field , one can simply add up contributions from different surface emission areas to @xmath205 to obtain the observed polarization fluxes .",
    "note that the description of the polarization evolution in the last paragraph is valid regardless of the possible complexity of the magnetic field near the stellar surface .",
    "this opens up the possibility of constraining the _ surface _",
    "magnetic field of the neutron star using x - ray polarimetry .",
    "for example , the polarization light curve ( particularly the dependence on the rotation phase ) depends only on the dipole component of the magnetic field , while the intensity lightcurve of the same source depends on the surface magnetic field . on the other hand , the linear polarization spectrum ( i.e. , its dependence on the photon energy ) depends on the magnetic field at the emission region ( lai & ho 2003b ; van adelsberg 2006 ) ; thus it is possible that a ns with a weak dipole field ( @xmath279 g ) may exhibit x - ray polarization spectrum characteristic of a @xmath280 g ns ( see section  1 ) .",
    "the qt propagation effect studied in this paper complicates the above picture somewhat .",
    "when a photon passes through the qt region ( which typically lies within a few stellar radii ) , its polarization modes can be temporarily recoupled , and this can give rise to partial mode conversion .",
    "thus after passing through the qt point , the mode intensities change to @xmath281 and @xmath282 .",
    "the observed polarization flux is then @xmath283 .    in the most general situations , to account for the qt propagation effect , it is necessary to integrate the polarization evolution equations ( see section 2.2 ) in order to obtain the observed radiation stokes parameters .",
    "however , we show in this paper that for generic near - surface magnetic fields , the effective region where the qt effect leads to significant polarization changes covers only a small area of the neutron star surface [ see section 3 , particularly eq .",
    "( 3.22 ) ] . for a given emission model ( and the size of the emission region ) and magnetic field structure",
    ", one can use our result in section 3 to evaluate the importance of the qt effect . in the case of surface emission from around the polar cap region of a dipole magnetic field",
    ", we have quantified the effect of qt propagation in detail ( section 4 ) and provided a simple , easy - to - use prescription to account for the qt effect in determining the observed pollarizatin fluxes .",
    "our key results are presented in sections 4.2    4.3 , particularly fig .",
    "11 and equations  ( 4.32 ) ( together with fig .",
    "10 ) and ( 4.35 )    ( 4.36 ) . as discussed in section 4.3",
    ", the net effect of qt propagation is to reduce the degree of linear polarization , so that @xmath284 , with the reduction factor depending on the photon energy , magnetic field strength , geometric angles , rotation phase and the emission area .",
    "the largest reduction is about a factor of two , and occurs for a particular emission size ( @xmath220 ; see fig .",
    "11 ) . obviously , for emission from a large area of the stellar surface , the qt effect is negligible .",
    "overall , the qt effect will have a small or at most modest effect on the observed x - ray polarization signals from magnetized neutron stars .",
    "thus the the description of x - ray polarizaton signals given in section 5.1 remains largely valid . in most situations (",
    "the exceptions are discussed in section 4.4 ) , the qt effect can be accounted for in a straightforward manner using the result presented in our paper .",
