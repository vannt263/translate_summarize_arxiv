    "in the theory of wormholes the prime important issue concerns energy which turns out to be negative ( i. e. exotic matter ) to resist against gravitational collapse . this and stability related matters informed by morris and thorne @xcite were restructured later on by hochberg and visser @xcite .",
    "the 2 + 1-dimensional version of wormholes was considered first in @xcite and more recent works can be found in @xcite .",
    "nonexistence of negative energy in classical physics / einstein s general relativity persisted as a serious handicap .",
    "given this fact , and without reference to quantum theory in which negative energy has rooms at smallest scales to resolve the problem of microscopic wormholes , how can then one tackle with the large scale wormholes ? .",
    "in this study , first we restrict ourselves to thin - shell wormholes ( tsws ) which are tailored by the cut - and - paste technique of spacetimes @xcite . in our view",
    "the theorems proved in @xcite for general wormholes should be taken cautiously and mostly relaxed when the subject matter is tsws @xcite .",
    "one important point that we emphasize / exploit is that the throat need not have a circular topology .",
    "it may depend on the angular variable as well , for example .",
    "this is the case that we naturally confront in static , non - spherical spacetimes .",
    "one such example is the zipoy - voorhees ( zv)-geometry which deviates from spherical symmetry by a deformation / oblateness parameter @xcite .",
    "we employed this to show that the overall / total energy can be made positive although locally , depending on angular location it may take negative values @xcite .",
    "we construct the simplest possible tsw in @xmath0dimensions whose bulk is made of flat minkowski spacetime .",
    "such a wormhole was constructed first by visser mv0 , for the spherical throat case in @xmath9dimensions . in our case of @xmath10dimensions",
    "the only non - zero curvature is at the throat which consists of a ring , apt for the proper junction conditions . for the shape of the throat",
    "we assume an arbitrary angular dependence in order to attain ultimately a positive total energy ( i.e. normal matter ) .",
    "in other words , the throat surface is chosen as @xmath11 for an appropriate function @xmath12 for @xmath13 , we recover the circular topology considered to date . note that @xmath14 is the coordinate time measured by an external observer . as a possible choice",
    "we employ @xmath15 which represents a starfish shape .",
    "the crucial point about the path of the throat is that it must be convex rather than concave in order to attain anything but exotic matter . a circle , which is concave yields the undesired negative energy .",
    "we present various alternatives for the starfish geometrical shapes to justify our argument . the limiting case of almost zero periodic dependence on the angle brings us to that of total energy zero(=a vacuum ) on the throat , which amounts to making tsw from a vacuum .    with this much information about @xmath0dimensional tsws",
    "we extend our argument to the @xmath0dimensional general traversable wormhole which is considered to be a brane in @xmath9dimensional flat spacetime .",
    "we provide explicit examples to show that @xmath0dimensional wormholes can be fueled by a total positive energy and the null energy condition is satisfied .",
    "organization of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we study tsws with general throat shapes .",
    "@xmath0dimensional wormholes induced from @xmath9dimensional flat spacetime is considered in section iii .",
    "the paper ends with conclusion in section iv .",
    "in this section we consider a model of tsw in @xmath0dimensional flat spacetime .",
    "hence , the bulk metric is given by@xmath16following @xcite we introduce @xmath17 as two incomplete manifolds from the original bulk and then we paste them on an identical hypersurface with equation @xmath18to make upon them a complete manifold known as the tsw .",
    "let s note that , in @xcite and the other consequent papers the proper time @xmath19 is used instead of the coordinate time @xmath14 which we consider here .",
    "as one can see , the results found in terms of @xmath14 can be easily transformed to terms of @xmath20 .",
    "for instance , in the case we consider here by setting @xmath21 the results will be expressed in terms of @xmath22 this relation also shows that in the static equilibrium case @xmath23 and therefore the physical properties such as the energy density and pressures are the same .",
    "the throat is located on the shell @xmath24 and therefore @xmath4 is a general function of @xmath25 and @xmath14 but not arbitrary . as , @xmath24 is going to be the throat which connects two different spacetimes , in @xmath0dimensions it must be a closed loop .",
    "we choose @xmath26 for the bulk and @xmath27 for the hypersurface .",
    "therefore while the bulk metric is given by @xmath28the induced metric on the shell @xmath29 is obtained by using @xmath30one finds@xmath31 in which a prime and a dot stand for derivative with respect to @xmath25 and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "next , we find the extrinsic curvature tensor defined as@xmath33 in which @xmath34with@xmath35using ( 2 ) , we find@xmath36the exact form of the normal vector is found to be@xmath37@xmath38and@xmath39such that @xmath40 the bulk s line element ( 1 ) admits @xmath41 @xmath42 while the rest of christoffel symbols are zero .",
    "therefore , the extrinsic curvature tensor elements become@xmath43@xmath44@xmath45israel junction conditions @xcite read@xmath46 in which @xmath47is the energy - momentum tensor on the thin - shell , @xmath48 and @xmath49 note that @xmath50 and @xmath51 are appropriate pressure terms .",
    "combining the results found above we get@xmath52@xmath53and@xmath54furthermore , one finds@xmath55@xmath56@xmath57and@xmath58we recall that@xmath59which implies@xmath60 in which @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 considering ( 26 ) in ( 21 - 25 ) we find@xmath64 } { \\left [ \\left ( r^{\\prime 2}+r^{2}\\right ) \\left ( 1-\\dot{r}% ^{2}\\right ) + \\dot{r}^{2}r^{\\prime 2}\\right ] \\sqrt{1+\\left ( \\frac{r^{\\prime } % } { r}\\right ) ^{2}-\\dot{r}^{2}}}\\]]@xmath65 } { % \\left [ \\left ( r^{\\prime 2}+r^{2}\\right ) \\left ( 1-\\dot{r}^{2}\\right ) + \\dot{r}% ^{2}r^{\\prime 2}\\right ] \\sqrt{1+\\left ( \\frac{r^{\\prime } } { r}\\right ) ^{2}-% \\dot{r}^{2}}}\\]]@xmath66 } { \\left [ \\left ( r^{\\prime 2}+r^{2}\\right ) \\left ( 1-\\dot{r}% ^{2}\\right ) + \\dot{r}^{2}r^{\\prime 2}\\right ] \\sqrt{1+\\left ( \\frac{r^{\\prime } % } { r}\\right ) ^{2}-\\dot{r}^{2}}}\\]]and@xmath67 } { \\left [ \\left ( r^{\\prime 2}+r^{2}\\right ) \\left ( 1-\\dot{r}^{2}\\right ) + \\dot{r}^{2}r^{\\prime 2}\\right ] \\sqrt{1+\\left ( \\frac{r^{\\prime } } { r}\\right ) ^{2}-\\dot{r}^{2}}}.\\]]therefore the israel junction conditions imply@xmath68and@xmath69 in static equilibrium , one may set @xmath70 and @xmath71 which consequently yield@xmath72and@xmath73this is not surprising since the bulk spacetime is flat .",
    "therefore in the static equilibrium , the only nonzero component of the energy - momentum tensor on the throat is the energy density @xmath74 we note that the total matter supporting the wormhole is given by@xmath75let s add that , a physically acceptable energy - momentum tensor must at least satisfy the weak energy conditions which implies i ) @xmath76 and ii ) @xmath77 and the total energy to be positive and finite .",
    "therefore for the energy momentum tensor which we have found on the surface with only energy density nonzero , our task reduces naturally to find the specific case with @xmath76 and @xmath78    in the sequel we consider the various possibilities of the shape of the throat including the circular one .",
    "the first case to be checked is the circular throat i.e. , @xmath79constant .",
    "this leads to @xmath80 and clearly violates the null energy condition which states that @xmath81     with its energy density distribution @xmath82 .",
    "we see that the signature of the curvature is positive everywhere and as a result the matter is exotic everywhere.,width=340 ]     and its energy density distribution @xmath82 .",
    "this figure shows that @xmath83 is positive when the curvature is negative and vice versa . the total energy which supports the wormhole",
    ", however , is negative.,width=340 ]     and @xmath82 in terms of @xmath84 note that @xmath82 is overwhelmingly positive and so is the total energy.,width=340 ]     and @xmath82 in terms of @xmath85 in this figure @xmath82 is positive everywhere as the curvature is negative , and the total energy is positive.,width=340 ]     in terms of @xmath86 for @xmath87 and @xmath88 and @xmath89 the total exotic matter @xmath90 for each case is also given .",
    "we observe that larger @xmath91 yields smaller amount of exotic matter such that @xmath92.,width=340 ]    for a specific function of @xmath93 there are four different possibilities : i ) @xmath94 on entire domain of @xmath95 , $ ] ii ) @xmath96 or @xmath76 but the total energy @xmath97 iii ) @xmath96 or @xmath76 with the total energy @xmath98 and iv ) @xmath99 herein , @xmath100is the total energy on the throat . in what follows we present illustrative examples for all cases .",
    "we note that the specific cases given below can be easily replaced by other functions but we must keep in mind that although @xmath101 is a general function , @xmath102 must present a closed path in @xmath0dimensions .      in the first example , the throat is deformed from a perfect circle to an oval shape given by@xmath104the shape of the throat and @xmath105 are shown in fig .",
    "1a and 1b , respectively . as we observe here in fig .",
    "1b , energy density is negative everywhere for @xmath106 $ ] .",
    "this is also seen from the shape of the throat whose curvature is positive on @xmath107 .$ ] although the total exotic matter for throat of the form of a circle of radius one is @xmath108 , in the case of ( 37 ) the total exotic matter is @xmath109 in geometrical unit .",
    "this shows that a small deformation causes the total exotic matter to be less .",
    "as our second case we consider   @xmath111which admits a throat of the shape shown in fig .",
    "2a . the corresponding energy density @xmath105 is shown in fig .",
    "as one can see the energy density is positive wherever the curvature of the throat is negative and vise versa .",
    "the overall energy is negative given by @xmath112 unit",
    ".      for @xmath114the shape of the throat looks like a starfish as it is displayed in fig .",
    "the behavior of the energy density @xmath105 is depicted in fig .",
    "as it is clear @xmath105 is positive everywhere except at the neighborhood of the corners of the throat where the curvature is positive .",
    "the total energy , however , is positive i.e. , @xmath115 unit .      for this case let s consider @xmath117which is shown in fig .",
    "4a . in this case",
    "@xmath105 is positive everywhere as it is shown in fig . 4b and the total energy is positive i.e. @xmath118 unit .",
    "we should admit , however , that although @xmath119 is well defined everywhere in the range of @xmath25 i.e. , @xmath120 $ ] at five spike points in the fig .",
    "4a its derivative does not exist .",
    "this feature of @xmath121 causes the energy density to be discontinuous at the same values of @xmath122 this means that @xmath105 is not defined at those points although its limit exists and is positive and finite .",
    "4c shows that @xmath105 is positive around those critical points .      to complete our analysis we look at the case given in section b and generalize the form of @xmath121 as given by@xmath124 in which @xmath125 and @xmath126 . in fig .",
    "5 we plot @xmath121 in terms of different @xmath91 and @xmath127 the total exotic matter for each case is also calculated .",
    "we observe that increasing @xmath91 decreases the magnitude of the exotic matter .",
    "when @xmath91 goes to infinity ( i.e. an infinite oscillation ) the total energy goes to zero while at each point the energy density shows a positive or negative fluctuation .",
    "of course the assumption of infinite frequency takes us away from the domain of classical physics , probably to the quantum domain . in the latter , particle creation from a vacuum",
    "is well - known . herein , instead of particles we have formation of wormholes .",
    "the ansatz ( 41 ) shows how one can go to the vacuum case @xmath128 with @xmath129 yet we wish to abide by the classical domain with @xmath130",

    "the energy density is negative everywhere.,width=340 ]    we consider the @xmath9dimensional minkowski spacetime in the cylindrical coordinates @xmath137with the substitution @xmath138 this gives the line element@xmath139 in which @xmath140 and @xmath141 where @xmath142 is a function of @xmath143 and @xmath25",
    ". using this line element , the einstein s tensor is obtained with only one nonzero component i.e.,@xmath144einstein s equation ( @xmath145 ) reads @xmath146 in which @xmath147 is the energy momentum tensor .",
    "the latter implies that the only non - zero component of the energy - momentum tensor is @xmath148 component and therefore @xmath149the total energy which supports the wormhole is obtained by@xmath150to complete this section we recall the case of physical energy - momentum tensor and the weak energy condition which we have discussed before . here , the situation is almost the same i.e. , the only nonzero component of the energy - momentum tensor is the energy density @xmath151 therefore in order to say that our wormhole is physical , which means it is supported by normal ( non - exotic ) matter , the conditions are @xmath152 and @xmath153      to have a wormhole we observe that @xmath154 must be chosen aptly for a general wormhole structure .",
    "for instance , one may consider in the first attempt @xmath155 and following that we find@xmath156so that the form of energy density becomes@xmath157the expression ( 48 ) is comparable with the morris - thorne s static wormhole@xmath158 in which @xmath159 and @xmath160 are the red - shift and shape functions , respectively . in the specific case ( 48 )",

    "the forms of @xmath185and@xmath186suggest that at the throat @xmath187 and also @xmath188 as expected .",
    "the form of energy density in terms of @xmath189 , however , becomes@xmath190the latter implies that any periodic function of @xmath191 which satisfies @xmath192 can represent a traversable wormhole with positive energy . in the case of @xmath193 or @xmath194 ,",

    "6 - 8 we plot the wormholes with @xmath121 given in ( 37 ) , ( 38 ) , ( 39 ) , ( 40 ) and ( 41 ) , respectively .",
    "also in fig .",
    "9 , the energy density @xmath196 corresponds to the individual cases of ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) for ( 37 ) , ( 38 ) , ( 39 ) and ( 40 ) , respectively , which are given in terms of @xmath143 and @xmath25 with @xmath132we see , for instance , that in fig . 9d",
    "the energy is positive everywhere .",
    "regarding fig .",
    "9d we must admit again that for the same reason as in the tsw , @xmath121 does not admit derivative at the spike points , therefore the energy density @xmath196 is not defined at the same points . on the other hand its limits exist at these critical points and are both finite and positive .",
    "this can be seen from ( 55 ) whose both numerator and denominator become infinity near the critical points while the ratio which is the limit of @xmath197 remains finite .",
    "this is similar to the behavior of a function like @xmath198 in the neighborhood of @xmath199",
    "first of all let us admit that traversable wormholes in @xmath0dimensions were considered much earlier , namely in 1990s @xcite , and became fashionable recently @xcite .",
    "our principal aim in this study is to establish a traversable wormhole with normal ( i.e. non - exotic ) matter in @xmath10dimensions . for the tsws",
    "the strategy is to assume a closed angular path of the form @xmath24 , where for @xmath13 , we recover the circular throat topology .",
    "since this leads to exotic matter it is not attractive by our assessment .",
    "let us note that throughout our study we use the coordinate time instead of the proper time .",
    "our analysis shows that any concave - shaped @xmath200 around the origin undergoes the same fate of exotic matter .",
    "however , a convex - shaped @xmath121 seems promising in obtaining a normal matter .",
    "this is shown by explicit ansatzes whose plots suggest starfish - shaped closed curves for the throat of a @xmath0dimensional wormhole .",
    "locally , for specific angular range it may yield negative energy , but in total the energy accumulates on the positive side .",
    "this result supports our previous finding that for the non - spherical spacetimes , i.e. the zv - metrics , the throats can be non - spherical and in turn one may obtain a tsw in einstein s theory with a positive total energy @xcite .",
    "the conclusion drawn herein for @xmath0dimensions therefore can be generalized to higher dimensions .",
    "a similar construction method has been employed for the general wormholes .",
    "we have treated the @xmath0dimensional wormhole as a brane in @xmath9dimensional minkowski space and show the possibility of physical traversable wormhole .",
    "it turns out , however , that the rabbit emerges from only very special hats , not from all hats .",
    "extension of our work to @xmath9dimensional wormholes is under construction ."
