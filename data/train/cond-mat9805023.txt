    "classical brownian motion is described by the langevin equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the position of the particle , @xmath3 is the friction coefficient , and @xmath4 is a stochastic force .",
    "this equation is meaningful only in a statistical sense .",
    "the time evolution of a phase space distribution @xmath5 is obtained by solving ( [ e1 ] ) for various realizations of the stochastic potential , and then averaging over all these realizations .",
    "the stochastic potential is zero on the average and its correlations are @xmath6 typically these correlations are characterized by a ` short ' temporal scale @xmath7 and a ` microscopic ' spatial scale @xmath8 .",
    "usually , it is further assumed that higher moments are determined by gaussian statistics .",
    "the langevin description can be derived by considering a general hamiltonian of the form @xmath9 where @xmath2 and @xmath10 are the canonical variables that correspond to the distinguished degree of freedom , @xmath11 is the free motion hamiltonian , and @xmath12 are environmental degrees of freedom",
    ". the dynamical variable @xmath2 may represent the position of a large particle . in the one - dimensional version of brownian motion it may represent the position of a piston .",
    "the actual conditions for having the reduced langevin description turn out to be quite weak  @xcite .",
    "the environment should consist of at least @xmath13 degrees of freedom with _",
    "fast _ chaotic dynamics .",
    "_ fast _ implies that the classical motion is characterized by a continuous spectrum with high frequency cutoff , such that the motion of the environment can be treated adiabatically with respect to the _ slow _ motion of the particle .",
    "it is essential to assume that the following condition is fulfilled @xmath14 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 characterize the correlations of the stochastic potential which is experienced by the particle .",
    "eq.([e4 ] ) is the condition for using the white noise approximation ( wna ) .",
    "namely , the noise is characterized by its intensity @xmath15 and its temporal correlations are adequately described by the formal expression @xmath16 . without loss of generality",
    "we assume from now on the normalization @xmath17 .",
    "the correlations of the stochastic force satisfy @xmath18 in the general case ,  ( [ e6 ] ) is less informative than ( [ e2 ] ) . however , in case of a classical particle that experiences white noise , the additional information is not required at all ! it should be emphasized that this observation does not hold if  ( [ e4 ] ) is not satisfied :",
    "if @xmath7 is larger than @xmath19 , then the particle will perform a stochastic motion that depends crucially on the `` topography '' of the stochastic potential .",
    "the classical analysis further reveals  @xcite that associated with the stochastic potential there is also a dissipation effect .",
    "if the environment is characterized by either micro - canonical or canonical temperature @xmath20 , then the friction parameter will be @xmath21 thus , any generic environment , in the sense specified above , leads to the universal ohmic behavior .",
    "the motion of the particle is determined by the interplay between the friction and the noise .",
    "the friction leads to damping of the particle s velocity , while the noise pumps energy back into its motion .",
    "eventually we have diffusion with coefficient @xmath22 .",
    "if  ( [ e4 ] ) is not satisfied , then we will have diffusion even in the absence of dissipation .",
    "the latter `` non - dissipative diffusion '' is characterized by the coefficient @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the velocity of the particle .",
    "this latter type of diffusive behavior should not be confused with the generic `` dissipative diffusion '' that characterizes brownian motion .",
    "one wonders whether there is a well defined quantized version of the above langevin equation .",
    "is it possible , quantum - mechanically , to characterize a universal dynamical behavior that corresponds to classical brownian motion ? are stronger physical conditions required in order to guarantee generic behavior ? in the present paper",
    "we have no intention to give a full answer to all these questions .",
    "rather , as in previous publications  @xcite , we follow the caldeira - leggett strategy  @xcite .",
    "namely , we consider the motion of a particle under the influence of an effective ( non - chaotic ) bath that is composed of infinitely many oscillators .",
    "the proper model that corresponds ( classically ) to the langevin equation  ( [ e1 ] ) with  ( [ e2 ] ) is the dld model that has been introduced in  @xcite .",
    "dld are the initials of `` diffusion localization and dissipation '' .",
    "these three effects comes out naturally from the quantum - mechanical solution of the dld model .",
    "quantum mechanically , it is convenient to use wigner function @xmath25 in order to represent the reduced probability density matrix .",
    "we can use the feynman - vernon ( fv ) formalism  @xcite in order to find an expression for the propagator @xmath26 .",
    "this propagator is uniquely determined once the friction ( @xmath3 ) , the temperature of the bath ( @xmath20 ) and the spatial correlations @xmath27 are specified .",
    "the dependence of the propagator on the bath - temperature is via the appearance of a quantum - mechanical version of the noise kernel @xmath28 .",
    "the latter is related to the friction coefficient via a universal fluctuation - dissipation relation . at high temperatures",
    "the quantum - mechanical @xmath28 coincides with its classical expression . at the limit of zero temperature @xmath28",
    "does not vanish , rather it develops a large negative tail . in the latter case , @xmath29 , the power spectrum of the noise , reflects the zero point fluctuations ( zpf ) of the environmental modes .",
    "the zwanzig - caldeira - leggett ( zcl ) model  @xcite constitutes a special formal limit of the dld model .",
    "it is obtained by taking the limit @xmath30 .",
    "both the zcl model and the dld model will be generalized in this paper to allow the analysis of brownian motion in @xmath0-dimensions .",
    "a modified version of the the dld model incorporates the effect of long range ( power - law ) spatial correlations . on the other hand",
    ", we are not discussing the dld model in its full generality ( as in  @xcite ) , but rather restricting ourselves to the particular circumstances that correspond in the classical limit to generic brownian motion .",
    "thus , we are considering the _ ohmic _ dld model , and further assume that  ( [ e4 ] ) is satisfied .    in case of the zcl model ,",
    "the quantal propagator @xmath26 is a gaussian stochastic kernel .",
    "consequently the dynamics can be obtained by solving the langevin equation  ( [ e1 ] ) with  ( [ e6 ] ) . at low - temperatures the quantum mechanical version of @xmath28 should be used . at high temperatures",
    "@xmath28 becomes classical - like and consequently the zcl propagator coincides with its classical limit .",
    "these observations do not hold in case of the dld model  @xcite . furthermore",
    ", the distinction between the quantal dld propagator and its classical limit persists even in the limit of high temperatures .",
    "it is important to define what is the meaning of ` high temperatures ' . as in the classical case ,",
    "a relatively simple description of the dynamics is obtained if it possesses a markovian property . with a markovian property",
    "it is possible to obtain the long - time evolution by composing short - time evolution steps .",
    "it is also possible then to write down a corresponding master equation for the wigner function .",
    "the fv path - integral expression for the propagator contains the quantum - mechanical version of @xmath28 rather than the classical one . in order to have",
    "a markovian property one should argue that it is possible to use the wna , meaning to replace @xmath28 by the effective classical - like delta - function .",
    "still , in case of the dld model , the result of the path integration is not classical - like : the high - temperature markovian limit is not the same as the classical limit .",
    "it turns out that the quantum - mechanical condition for using the wna , thus having a markovian property , is more restrictive than  ( [ e4 ] ) . for ballistic - like",
    "motion we shall see that the actual condition is , in most circumstances , @xmath31 a recent derivation of the high temperature ohmic dld model which is based on a synthetic rmt hamiltonian has been reported in  @xcite .",
    "the existence of such a derivation is most encouraging since it further support the idea of having a universal description of quantal brownian motion , at least in the markovian limit .",
    "it has been speculated by the authors of the latter reference that a future extension of their formalism will lead to an agreement with the general result of  @xcite .",
    "the high temperature ohmic dld model has been discussed in  @xcite and has been further analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "the physical picture of high - temperature dynamics will be further illuminated in the present paper .",
    "loss of coherence , or dephasing , is a central issue in the analysis of quantal brownian motion .",
    "wigner s picture of the dynamics leads to the distinction between two different mechanisms for loss of coherence . in case of zcl model one should consider the ` _ spreading mechanism _ ' .",
    "this classical - like non - perturbative mechanism is very effective in smearing away the interference pattern . in case of the dld model",
    ", coherence is much better maintained , and one should consider the perturbative ` _ scattering mechanism _ ' for dephasing .    at the limit of zero temperature , the spreading mechanism is still effective in suppressing interference .",
    "one can use the langevin formalism in order to analyze the smearing of the interference pattern .",
    "it is important , however , to take into account the negative temporal - correlations of the effective noise  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the analysis of low - temperature dephasing in case of the ` scattering mechanism ' is a quite subtle issue , that constitutes a main concern of the present paper .",
    "the langevin formalism is no - longer applicable , and the lack of a markovian property enforce a semiclassical approach .",
    "the semiclassical approach has a further advantage : it is possible to go beyond the analysis of a simple ballistic - like brownian motion and to analyze other types of transport .",
    "we shall distinguish between ballistic , diffusive and chaotic motions through cavities .",
    "we shall derive various results and contributions to the dephasing rate in the various temperature regimes and depending on the physical circumstances .",
    "some of these results coincide with similar computations that are related to electrons in metal  @xcite .",
    "an important question is whether the scattering mechanism is still effective in suppressing interference at the limit of zero temperature @xcite .",
    "it turns out that our semiclassical approach , in spite of its other advantages , has a limited range of validity .",
    "it can be trusted if the kinetic energy of the particle is sufficiently large .",
    "for ballistic - like motion large energy means @xmath32 in analogy with  ( [ e8 ] ) .",
    "the latter condition can be cast into the more suggestive form @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the de - broglie wavelength of the particle .",
    "the large - energy condition is obviously satisfied in case of the zcl model ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the large energy condition may not be satisfied in case of the dld model , and consequently the semiclassical result should be modified .",
    "in particular , in case of a low - temperature thermal motion , the contribution of the zero point fluctuations ( zpf ) to the dephasing rate should be excluded .",
    "we consider a bath that consists of infinitely many oscillators whose canonical coordinates are @xmath12 .",
    "the bath hamiltonian is @xmath35 in case of the dld model the interaction of the particle with the oscillators is described by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the location of the @xmath38 oscillator , @xmath39 describes the interaction between the particle and the @xmath38 oscillator , and @xmath40 are coupling constants .",
    "it is assumed that the function @xmath41 depends only on @xmath42 .",
    "the range of the interaction will be denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "the oscillators are distributed uniformly all over space .",
    "locally , the distribution of their frequencies is ohmic .",
    "namely , @xmath43 it is useful to define the spatial auto - correlation function @xmath44 without loss of generality @xmath41 is normalized such that @xmath17 .",
    "for example , we may consider a gaussian @xmath41 for which @xmath45 the @xmath0-dimensional ft of @xmath46 will be denoted by @xmath47 .",
    "the mode - density ( after angular integration ) is @xmath48 . in general",
    ", we shall assume that @xmath49 where @xmath8 characterize the spatial scale of the correlations , and @xmath50 is a dimensionless constant . in case of the short range gaussian - type correlations  ( [ e13 ] ) , the parameter @xmath51 equals simply to the dimensionality @xmath0 .",
    "for long range power - law interaction it may be less than @xmath0 , possibly negative . in a moment",
    "we shall argue that in order to have a well defined model we must have @xmath52 .",
    "therefore only @xmath53 is meaningful .",
    "the regime @xmath54 is well defined but it requires special treatment since @xmath55 diverges .",
    "the formal limit @xmath30 corresponds to the zcl model .",
    "the zcl model describes interaction of a particle with environmental modes whose wavelength is much larger compared with the distances that are explored by the particle .",
    "consequently , the interaction with the @xmath38 field - mode is approximated by a linear function .",
    "the interaction term in the hamiltonian that _ defines _ the zcl model is of the following form ( here generalized to @xmath0-dimensions ) : @xmath56 the unit vectors @xmath57 are assumed to be distributed isotropically .",
    "the distribution of the oscillators with respect to their frequencies is assumed to be ohmic , as in  ( [ e11 ] ) with the @xmath58 omitted .",
    "the classical analysis of the @xmath0-dimensional dld model constitutes a trivial generalization of the one - dimensional dld model that has been considered in  @xcite .",
    "equation ( 3.10 ) in the latter reference should be replaced by the following expression for the friction : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the velocity of the particle . for ohmic bath @xmath61",

    "one obtains then @xmath63 . obviously , in order to obtain a finite result",
    "it is crucial to have @xmath52 .",

    "the reduced motion of the particle will be described by the langevin equation  ( [ e1 ] ) , where the noise satisfies  ( [ e2 ] ) , with @xmath64 . for the realization of a classical trajectory ,",

    "the notions perturbative and non - perturbative are used in order to suggest a connection with an earlier work  @xcite .",
    "the smearing effect can be regarded as arising from accumulation of many small - momentum scattering events .",
    "a conventional perturbative approach can not be applied in order to analyze such dephasing process , even in the limit of very faint noise .",

    "is the spreading mechanism .",
    "see detailed analysis in the next paragraph . if the environment characterized by a spatial correlation scale @xmath121 then a totally different picture emerges .",
    "now , wigner function contains a modulation on a momentum scale much finer than @xmath104 .",
    "this modulation is not affected by the friction , but its intensity decays exponentially in time .",
    "this is based on inspection of either the propagator  ( [ e22 ] ) , or the equivalent master equation  ( [ e25 ] ) . in the latter case note",
    "that the convolution with @xmath114 can be replaced by multiplication with @xmath122 .",
    "the decay rate is @xmath123 it is a universal result for the dephasing rate due to the ` scattering mechanism ' , since it does not depend on details of the quantum - mechanical state involved .",
    "however , the validity of this result is restricted to the high temperature regime , where the white noise approximation ( wna ) can be applied .",
    "for completeness we turn back to the detailed analysis of dephasing due to spreading .",
    "this mechanism leads to non - universal results , since the calculation of the dephasing time depends on actual details of the interference pattern .",
    "for concreteness we consider the simplest case of a two - slit interference experiment .",
    "the wavepacket that emerges from the two slits is assumed to be a superposition @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the momentum of the incident particle , and @xmath126 is a radial envelope function . the corresponding wigner function is @xmath127 the 1-slit wigner function is multiplied by @xmath128 , and therefore it is natural to regard the 2-slits wigner function as composed of partial - wavepackets , each characterized by a different transverse momentum . by definition",
    "the partial - wavepacket @xmath129 equals @xmath130 for @xmath131 and equals zero otherwise .",

    "the interference pattern is smeared on a momentum scale @xmath139 , and on a corresponding spatial scale @xmath140 .",
    "the interference pattern disappears once @xmath141 or equivalently @xmath142 .",
    "this leads to the following expression for the dephasing time : @xmath143 comparing with  ( [ e28 ] ) we observe that indeed the smearing mechanism is very effective in suppressing the interference pattern .",
    "the result is also non - universal since it depends on details of the interference pattern . in some other circumstances , where wigner function is characterized by a different type of interference pattern ( notably the case of `` vertical '' interference pattern ) , the dephasing time may be proportional to some fractional power of the noise intensity  @xcite . in general , in the full analysis of the smearing process , one should take into account the effect of friction . in the above example this effect has been neglected .",
    "the analysis of dephasing in case of the zcl model is easily extended to the low - temperature regime .",
    "langevin formalism is still applicable , provided the appropriate @xmath28 is being used .",

    "there is a totally different approach to analyze dephasing , that is based on the semiclassical point of view .",
    "the advantage of the semiclassical approach is the ability to pursue the study of dephasing to the low - temperature regime as well as to circumstance in which the simple ballistic - like brownian motion scenario is not applicable .",
    "specific examples that will be discussed later are the transmission via either chaotic or diffusive cavity . from now on we regard the two - slit experiment as a special case of transport problem .",

    "common wisdom  @xcite is that the applicability of the semiclassical approach is restricted to circumstances such that the energy transfer between the particle and the environment is much smaller than the particle s available energy .",
    "technically , it is equivalent to the assumption of uncoupled wave - equations  @xcite . the _ coupled _ wave - equations for the particle - oscillators system can be _ uncoupled _ provided certain conditions are satisfied",
    ". then we can treat the particle as moving with constant velocity @xmath24 and solve for the oscillators .",

    "therefore , one should anticipate problems once oscillators with @xmath206 larger than @xmath164 are involved . in the latter case",
    ", there is no justification to think of the particle as decoupled from the bath , moving with some constant velocity , capable of exciting oscillators along the way .",
    "therefore the corresponding factor @xmath167 loses its physical significance . from the above considerations it follows that a reasonable condition for the validity of our semiclassical approach is @xmath207 on physical grounds this is the condition for being able to leave a trace `` along the way '' .",

    "similar question has been raised in  @xcite .",
    "one should not take for granted that the effect of low - frequency fluctuations is completely masked by the the incoherent effect of the high frequency modes .",
    "the first obvious step is to calculate the `` statistical '' dephasing rate due to the presence of the ( effective ) disorder",

    "it is quite striking that the friction coefficient @xmath3 is not affected by quantum mechanical effects . having the boltzmann picture in mind",

    "let us consider the time evolution of a gaussian wavepacket using either the propagator  ( [ e24 ] ) or the equivalent master equation  ( [ e25 ] ) . clearly , the dissipation rate @xmath251 is the same as in the classical picture , with small transient corrections .",

    "we see that for the above _ non - thermal motion _ the dephasing time is always shorter than the damping time .",
    "the dephasing rate is linear in @xmath20 at high temperature , and saturates at low temperatures .    for _ thermal motion _",
    "the latter statement is no - longer true . at the low temperature regime",

    "whenever diffusive motion of electrons is concerned ( see appendix e ) , our expressions agree with well know results  @xcite .",
