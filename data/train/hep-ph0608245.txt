    "since the discovery of the @xmath0 meson in 1974 , charmonium has provided a useful laboratory for quantitative tests of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and , in particular , of the interplay of perturbative and non - perturbative phenomena .",
    "the factorisation formalism @xcite of nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite provides a rigorous theoretical framework for the description of heavy - quarkonium production and decay .",
    "this formalism implies a separation of short - distance coefficients , which can be calculated perturbatively as expansions in the strong - coupling constant @xmath2 , from long - distance matrix elements ( mes ) , which must be extracted from experiment .",
    "the relative importance of the latter can be estimated by means of velocity scaling rules ; _ i.e. _ , the mes are predicted to scale with a definite power of the heavy - quark ( @xmath3 ) velocity @xmath4 in the limit @xmath5 . in this way",
    ", the theoretical predictions are organised as double expansions in @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "a crucial feature of this formalism is that it takes into account the complete structure of the @xmath6 fock space , which is spanned by the states @xmath7 with definite spin @xmath8 , orbital angular momentum @xmath9 , total angular momentum @xmath10 , and colour multiplicity @xmath11 .",
    "the hierarchy of the mes predicted by the velocity scaling rules is explained for the @xmath0 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 mesons in table  [ tab:1 ] . in particular , this formalism predicts the existence of colour - octet ( co ) processes in nature .",
    "this means that @xmath6 pairs are produced at short distances in co states and subsequently evolve into physical , colour - singlet ( cs ) quarkonia by the non - perturbative emission of soft gluons . in the limit @xmath14 , the traditional cs model ( csm ) @xcite",
    "is recovered in the case of @xmath8-wave quarkonia .",
    "the greatest triumph of this formalism was that it was able to correctly describe @xcite the cross section of inclusive charmonium hadroproduction measured in @xmath15 collisions at the fermilab tevatron @xcite , which had turned out to be more than one order of magnitude in excess of the theoretical prediction based on the csm .",
    "apart from this phenomenological drawback , the csm also suffers from severe conceptual problems indicating that it is incomplete .",
    "these include the presence of logarithmic infrared singularities in the @xmath16 corrections to @xmath17-wave decays to light hadrons and in the relativistic corrections to @xmath8-wave annihilation @xcite , and the lack of a general argument for its validity in higher orders of perturbation theory .    in order to convincingly establish the phenomenological significance of the co processes , it is indispensable to identify them in other kinds of high - energy experiments as well",
    ". studies of charmonium production in @xmath1 photoproduction , @xmath1 and @xmath18 deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) , @xmath19 annihilation in the continuum , @xmath20-boson decays , @xmath21 collisions , and @xmath22-hadron decays may be found in the literature ; for reviews , see @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the polarisation of @xmath12 mesons produced directly and of @xmath0 mesons produced promptly , _",
    "i.e. _ , either directly or via the feed - down from heavier charmonia , which also provides a sensitive probe of co processes , was investigated @xcite . until recently , none of these studies was able to prove or disprove the nrqcd factorisation hypothesis .",
    "however , h1 data of @xmath23 in dis at the desy hadron electron ring accelerator ( hera ) @xcite and delphi data of @xmath24 at the cern large electron positron collider ( lep2 ) @xcite provide first independent evidence for it by agreeing with the respective nrqcd predictions @xcite .",

    "in fact , among the partonic subprocesses contributing at lo , @xmath32+\\gamma , \\label{eq : p}\\\\ e+g&\\to&e+c\\overline{c}\\left[{}^3\\!s_1^{(8)}\\right]+\\gamma , \\label{eq : g}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the latter is by far dominant because , in the relevant range of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the density of gluons in the proton is so much higher than the one of photons that the @xmath35 suppression of @xmath36\\right\\rangle$ ] relative to @xmath37\\right\\rangle$ ] ( see table  [ tab:1 ] ) is inconsequential .",
    "the emission of photons off the proton can happen either elastically or inelastically , _",
    "i.e. _ , the proton stays intact or is destroyed . in both cases ,",
    "the parton density function ( pdf ) can be evaluated in the weizscker - williams approximation @xcite .",
    "besides electromagnetic proton interaction , also diffractive scattering off the proton , via pomeron exchange , allows for cs processes .",
    "however , such events will be accumulated at the border of the phase space , at @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the inelasticity variable defined in sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] . by the same token",
    ", they can be eliminated from the experimental data set by applying an appropriate acceptance cut on @xmath39 . in this paper , we assume this to be done .    the potential of @xmath0 plus photon associated production to probe the co mechanism was already investigated for photoproduction in @xmath1 scattering @xcite . in that case , however , the bulk of the cross section , more than 2/3 for @xmath0 transverse momenta @xmath40  gev ( see table  ii of @xcite ) , is due to the cs channel @xmath41+\\gamma$ ] in resolved photoproduction .",
    "specifically , the photoproduction analogue of process  ( [ eq : g ] ) , @xmath42+\\gamma$ ] , only makes up 1/5 of the total cross section @xcite . on the other hand , the probability of a photon to appear resolved rapidly decreases with its size @xmath43 , so that the situation encountered in @xcite is subject to a dramatic change as one passes from photoproduction to dis .    in @xcite ,",
    "prompt @xmath0 plus photon associated photoproduction in @xmath21 collisions was studied in next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , and sizeable corrections to the cross section were found .",
    "since the present analysis is at an exploratory level , considering process  ( [ eq : had ] ) for the first time , we stay at lo . a nlo analysis of process  ( [ eq : had ] ) would be more involved than in the case of @xcite , due to the presence of @xmath34 as an additional mass scale , and is left for future work .",
