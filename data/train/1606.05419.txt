    "the eigenvalue problem of the biharmonic equation ( biharmonic eigenvalue problem ) is one of the fundamental model problems in linear elasticity , and can find applications in , e.g. , modelling the vibration of thin plates .",
    "there has been a long history on developing the finite element methods of the biharmonic eigenvalue problem , and many schemes have been proposed for discretization @xcite , computation of guaranteed upper and lower bounds@xcite , and adaptive method and its convergence analysis @xcite .",
    "this paper is devoted to studying the multi - level efficient method of the biharmonic eigenvalue problem .",
    "specifically , we present a discretization scheme which preserves the nested essence on nested grids , and then construct a multi - level algorithm based on the scheme .",
    "the cost of the multi - level algorithm versus the intrinsic accuracy of the scheme is asymptotically optimal .",
    "as well known , the multi - level algorithm based on nested essence has been a key tool in computational mathematics and scientific computing fields . for the eigenvalue problem ,",
    "many multi - level algorithms have been designed and implemented .",
    "for example , there are several successful methods for the poisson eigenvalue problem .",
    "the two - grid method has been proposed and analyzed by xu - zhou in @xcite .",
    "the idea of the two - grid method is related to the ideas in [ 23 , 24 ] for nonsymmetric or indefinite problems and nonlinear elliptic equations . since then , many numerical methods for solving eigenvalue problems based on the idea of the two - grid method are developed ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "a type of multi - level correction scheme is presented by lin - xie @xcite and xie @xcite .",
    "the method is a type of operator iterative method ( see , e.g , @xcite ) . besides",
    ", xie @xcite presents a multi - level correction scheme , and the guaranteed lower bounds of the eigenvalues can be obtained . the correction method for eigenvalue problems in these papers",
    "are based on a series of finite element spaces with different approximation properties related to the multi - level method ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . with the proposed methods ,",
    "the eigenvalue problem is transformed to an eigenvalue problem on the coarsest grid and a series of source problem on the fine grids .",
    "the scheme can be proved asymptotically optimal .",
    "the same strategy can be implemented on the stokes equation , and similar asymptotic optimality is constructed @xcite .",
    "these works mentioned above have indeed presented a framework of designing multi - level schemes which works well for the elliptic eigenvalue problem and stable saddle point problem , provided a series of subproblems with intrinsic nestedness .",
    "in contrast to the second order problem , the multi - level method for the biharmonic eigenvalue problem has seldom been discussed , due to the lack of nested subproblems .",
    "indeed , when we consider the primal formulation of the biharmonic problem , the high stiffness of the sobolev space @xmath0 makes it difficult to construct nested discretizations . besides spline - type elements",
    ", the rectangular bfs element @xcite is the only element which can form nested finite element spaces on nested grids ; a multi - level algorithm has been designed based on bfs element for fourth order problems on rectangular grids @xcite .",
    "moreover , elements that are able to form nested spaces are proved to be conforming ones ; therefore , people can not obtain guaranteed lower bounds of eigenvalues with these elements .",
    "one way for this situation is to loose the stiffness of the finite element spaces .",
    "mixed element method is then frequently used , and several schemes for the biharmonic eigenvalue problem with polynomials of low degree have been designed@xcite . also , some discretization schemes of mixed type for boundary value problems can be naturally utilized for the eigenvalue problem ; we refer readers to @xcite for related discussion",
    ". however , we have to remark that the order - reduced nestedness discretizations is still not straightforward .",
    "for example , the ciarlet - raviart formulation@xcite admits us to discretize the biharmonic operator with piecewise continuous linear polynomials .",
    "however , as this formulation is stable on the space pair @xmath1 @xcite , the inheritance of the _ topology _ onto the finite element space is an issue , and the finite element spaces on nested grids are not _ topologically _ nested .",
    "the same problem is encountered for some other mixed formulations which introduce direct auxiliary variables , such as @xcite .",
    "more discussion can be found in @xcite .",
    "these may explain why few multi - level scheme is discussed for the biharmonic eigenvalue problem .    in this paper",
    ", we seek to implement multi - level strategy by constructing amiable nested finite element discretization for the biharmonic eigenvalue problem .",
    "we first introduce a mixed formulation whose corresponding source problem is discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this mixed formulation is stable on sobolev spaces of zero and first orders ( cf .",
    "lemma [ eq : contiiso ] below ) .",
    "as the stiffness is loosened , polynomials of low degree are enough for its discretization , and optimal accuracy can be expected .",
    "therefore , it admits discretizations that are nested algebraically and _ topologically_. secondly , we construct a family of multi - level schemes for the mixed formulation of the eigenvalue problem .",
    "the multi - level algorithms for biharmonic eigenvalue problem possess optimal accuracy and optimal computational cost .    for the proposed algorithms , both theoretical analysis and numerical verification",
    "are given .",
    "we remark that , though the multi - level strategy is essentially the same as the one used by lin - xie @xcite , the theoretical analysis is not directly by the same virtue .",
    "actually , if we separate the  primal variables \" from  lagrangian multipliers \" , we will find the skeleton bilinear form is not coercive on the primal variables nor on the lagrangian multipliers .",
    "this makes the classical theory of the spectral approximation of the saddle - point problems ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) not directly usable in the present paper .",
    "a precise discussion can be found in remark [ rem : vsstokes ] . meanwhile , because of the saddle - point - type essence , the problem is also different from the steklov eigenvalue problem discussed in @xcite .",
    "we therefore construct different theory framework and interpret the eigenvalue problem in mixed formulation as the eigenvalue problem of a generalized symmetric operator rather than a self - adjoint one , and accomplish the theoretical analysis .",
    "the differences between our theory and the existing theory for elliptic or saddle point problems include : ( 1 ) we represent some existing results which are originally in variational formulation into operator formulation , and then present error estimation in that context ; the operator formulation can bridge the gap between the biharmonic problem and the classical theory of spectral approximation , and can avoid complicated appearance especially for the mixed formulation ; ( 2 ) we figure out some properties of generalized symmetric operators which are not necessarily self - adjoint ; and ( 3 ) in our theory , we do not try to interpret the problem as a restrained problem on primal variables or one on lagrangian multipliers , which is usually done for saddle - point problem ; this makes the algorithm construction and theoretical analysis more straightforward .",
    "the remaining of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : sa ] , we present the theory of spectral approximation of the generalized symmetric operators .",
    "some existing results are restated and re - proved , and some new results are presented . in section [ sec : mm ] , we present a mixed formulation of the biharmonic eigenvalue problem , and construct its ( single - level ) discretization schemes . a multi - level algorithm is then constructed accordingly . both the single- and multi - level algorithms are optimal in accuracy , and the multi - level one also possesses optimal computational cost .",
    "the theoretical proof is obtained under the framework discussed in section [ sec : mm ] .",
    "numerical examples are then given in section [ sec : ne ] with respect to both single- and multi - level methods .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : cr ] , some concluding remarks and further discussion are given .",
    "in this section , we present some known and new results , including    * an estimate of spectral projection operator ( lemma [ lem : proj ] ) ; * an multi - level algorithm ( algorithm [ alg : mlalg ] ) and its convergence estimate ( theorem [ thm : cmla ] ) ; * spectral approximation of generalized symmetric operator ( lemmas [ lem : listast],[lem : listastdis ] and [ lem : estgsev ] ) ; * corresponding results in variational form ( lemma [ lem : listtevvf ] , algorithm [ alg : variational ] and theorem [ thm : cmlavf ] ) .    some bibliographic comments are given around .",
