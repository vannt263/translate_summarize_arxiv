    "the cdf collaboration at the fermilab tevatron collider has reported  @xcite an @xmath0 event that does not seem to have a standard model ( sm ) interpretation .",
    "we confirm that the event is consistent with the kinematics of selectron pair production ( @xmath4 ) , with a mass @xmath5 in the range @xmath6 to @xmath7 gev , and about the expected cross section for one event in 100 @xmath8 of data . in the neutralino lsp scenario ,",
    "the selectron @xmath9 must decay mainly into the next - to - lightest neutralino @xmath10 and an electron ( @xmath11 ) , followed by @xmath10 decay to the lightest neutralino @xmath12 through the radiative channel @xmath13  @xcite ; this chain is expected to have a high probability if @xmath12 is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) and is higgsino - like while @xmath10 is gaugino - like . alternatively ,",
    "if there is a very light gravitino @xmath14  @xcite with a mass @xmath15 , then the selectron decay is interpreted as @xmath16 followed by @xmath17 . while we were writing this paper , ref .",
    "@xcite appeared .",
    "it also discusses the light gravitino scenario , but not the neutralino lsp scenario , for the cdf @xmath0 event .",
    "we determine a set of supersymmetric soft - breaking parameters , superpotential parameters , and @xmath18 values that give masses and event rates consistent with the @xmath0 event , as well as all other theoretical and phenomenological constraints , including lep11.3 data .",
    "then we calculate rates for production and decay of selectrons , charginos , neutralinos and associated processes . finding any of these",
    "would greatly strengthen the supersymmetric interpretation .",
    "we illustrate how to experimentally distinguish the two supersymmetric scenarios ( where the lsp is either @xmath12 or @xmath14 ) .",
    "when @xmath12 is the lsp , we find the soft - breaking masses @xmath19 , @xmath20 do not satisfy the gaugino mass unification condition @xmath21 , but rather @xmath22 .",
    "interestingly , the resulting models are like those that give a supersymmetric interpretation of the lep @xmath23 excess , but we will not pursue that question in detail in this paper . in the light gravitino scenario , one can maintain the gaugino mass unification relation .",
    "our main result is to establish the validity of the supersymmetric interpretation of the @xmath0 event by identifying the region of parameter space that satisfies the kinematic , cross section , and branching ratio constraints .",
    "then we provide predictions for events whose presence ( absence ) would confirm ( exclude ) the supersymmetric interpretation of the @xmath0 event .",
    "we perform our analysis in terms of a general supersymmetric lagrangian at the electroweak scale , with no unification assumptions nor significant assumptions about the unknown superpartner masses . in low energy supersymmetry , as in the standard model , masses are unknown until they are measured .",
    "some cross sections only depend on the mass of the produced particles and are thus unique , while others depend on masses of exchanged sparticles and can have a range , which we report . in some cases we show a scatter plot which is produced by allowing unknown masses ( and @xmath18 ) to take on the range of values allowed by theoretical and phenomenological constraints , and the @xmath0 event .",
    "the different sets of supersymmetric parameters ( masses and couplings ) are often referred to as `` models '' , though they all parameterize the same lagrangian .",
    "we have investigated the kinematics of this event , under the hypothesis that it can be ascribed to selectron pair production @xmath24 with a subsequent 2-body decay for each selectron : @xmath25 followed by @xmath26 . here",
    "@xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) is the lightest ( next - to - lightest ) neutral , odd r - parity , fermion .",
    "we assume exact r - parity conservation , so that @xmath27 is an absolutely stable lsp .",
    "one can then identify two possible scenarios . in the first , ``",
    "neutralino lsp '' scenario , @xmath29 are the two lightest neutralino states , @xmath30 , i.e.  mixtures of photino , zino , and higgsinos . in the second , ``",
    "light gravitino '' scenario , @xmath28 is the lightest neutralino @xmath12 , and @xmath27 is a very light gravitino @xmath14 , which can be treated as massless for all kinematical purposes . under the assumptions that each @xmath31 , @xmath28 is on mass shell and that all decays occur close to the apparent vertex , we can find some non - trivial constraints .",
    "( the latter assumption need not hold in the light gravitino scenario , as we shall see . )",
    "first , we observe that only one pairing of electron and photon  @xcite gives consistent kinematics for @xmath32 .",
    "we also find the following constraints on the unknown sparticle masses : @xmath33 ; @xmath34 , @xmath35 ] ; @xmath36 $ ] . in particular ,",
    "the event is consistent with a massless @xmath27 ( e.g. in the light gravitino scenario ) .",
    "the upper limits on @xmath37 depend weakly on a conservative upper bound on the invariant mass of the selectron pair @xmath38 following from the cross section ; this also requires that @xmath5 is not larger than roughly 130 gev .",
    "we also find that the kinematics of the event give a lower bound on @xmath38 of about 275 gev .",
    "these constraints are based on measured quantities that have experimental errors , and can be sharpened with a more detailed study of the event .",
    "further constraints arise in particular interpretations described below .",
    "( in principle , another possible origin of the @xmath0 event is chargino pair production , but dynamical and kinematical considerations tend to disfavor this process ; we will discuss this in ref .  @xcite . )",
    "in fig .  [ slepton ] , we display the cross sections for slepton production  @xcite at the tevatron ( @xmath39 ) in the mass region suggested by the kinematics .",
    "the slepton production cross sections depend only on the masses of the sleptons , so the cross sections decouple from analyses of particular scenarios ( neutralino lsp or light gravitino ) . for reference , cdf and",
    "d0 each have about @xmath40 of integrated luminosity , so the one event level is at @xmath41 .",
    "typically @xmath42 for equal mass sleptons .",
    "if the @xmath0 event is from @xmath43 production then the @xmath44 channel is definitely accessible since @xmath43 and @xmath45 are in an su(2)@xmath46 doublet and thus related by the sum rule @xmath47 , with @xmath48 ; hence @xmath49 .",
    "further , if @xmath50 and @xmath51 were measured separately , then the sum rule provides an experimental determination of @xmath18 .",
    "if the event is from @xmath52 production , then @xmath50 and @xmath51 are not determined by the event . in many unified models",
    "one finds @xmath53 , but this is not required  @xcite .",
    "although we mainly discuss selectron production in the following , if lepton family universality is at least approximately valid in supersymmetry , then our discussion also applies to @xmath54 and @xmath55 events . in particular , second and third",
    "family sleptons ( smuon , stau ) would have the same production cross sections as the selectron if the masses were the same .",
    "slepton mass degeneracy is not an unreasonable expectation , and is suggested by the lack of flavor changing neutral currents .",
    "an interesting signature of supersymmetry emerges by considering second and third family slepton production . since the leptons from slepton decay will always have the same flavor",
    ", one would expect no events with a signature @xmath56 except for the small contribution from stau production when the @xmath55 s decay leptonically",
    ". however , the rate for @xmath56 is only @xmath57 the rate for same - flavor leptons @xmath58 or @xmath59 .",
    "contrast this rate with the very small sm process @xmath60 , which has a rate for @xmath56 that is a factor of 2 _ greater _ than either @xmath58 or @xmath59 .",
    "hence , the eventual observation of a much reduced fraction of @xmath56 events over @xmath58 would strongly support a supersymmetric interpretation .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) has a particle spectrum including the sm particles plus their superpartners , with the sm gauge group su(3)@xmath61 @xmath62 su(2)@xmath46 @xmath62 u(1)@xmath63 .",
    "we generally follow the notation and conventions of ref .",
    "@xcite , including that for the sign of @xmath54 .",
    "we do not impose gaugino mass unification ( @xmath64 ) , nor scalar mass unification  we make no assumptions about high scale ( @xmath65 ) physics .",
    "in fact , we can test gaugino mass unification , as explained below .",
    "the @xmath0 does have a consistent neutralino lsp interpretation , with masses and couplings that are tightly constrained . in order to have the decay @xmath11 dominate",
    ", @xmath10 must be largely gaugino ( i.e. @xmath66 , @xmath67 rather than higgsino ) . in order to have the radiative decay @xmath13 dominate ,",
    "it is necessary to have one of @xmath12,@xmath10 be mainly gaugino and the other mainly higgsino  @xcite . since only the gaugino will couple to @xmath68 , this uniquely fixes @xmath12 to be mainly higgsino , @xmath10 to be mainly gaugino .",
    "an examination of the neutralino mass matrix  @xcite then leads to the region of parameter space @xmath69 and @xmath22 . in the limit when these relations are exact",
    ", one neutralino is a pure higgsino @xmath70 ( where @xmath71,@xmath72 are the so - called `` antisymmetric'',``symmetric '' combinations of @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) with a mass @xmath75 , and another is a pure photino with a mass @xmath76 .",
    "the other two neutralino states are zino - higgsino mixtures with masses @xmath77 .",
    "the two chargino masses are given by the same relation with @xmath78 . in order to obtain the desired hierarchy of neutralino masses such",
    "that @xmath79 , @xmath54 must be negative , and @xmath75 must be smaller than @xmath22 .",
    "also , the kinematics of the event give @xmath80 , and @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 must be sufficiently heavy to not have @xmath84 and @xmath85 pairs seen at lep1.3 .",
    "this almost fixes the allowed ranges of @xmath75 and @xmath22 .    if we try to move away from @xmath22 ( e.g. toward the sugra - mssm ) , it is still possible to have a large br(@xmath13 ) when @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) and small @xmath18  @xcite , but then @xmath88 is near @xmath82 and the kinematical properties of the event can not be satisfied ; if one increases the mass difference by increasing @xmath18 , the radiative branching ratio drops .",
    "thus it appears to be very difficult if not impossible to have a sugra - mssm interpretation of the @xmath0 event .",
    "the analytical limits discussed above point to a specific region of the supersymmetric parameter space that we have explored with complete numerical calculations .",
    "we require the combined branching ratio @xmath89 to be greater than 50% , consistent with the @xmath0 event .",
    "the inputs include @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath54 , @xmath18 to obtain the chargino and neutralino masses and mixings , in addition to the squark and slepton sector , which enter the branching ratios .",
    "apart from a possibly light stop @xmath90 , squarks do not significantly affect our analysis as long as they are heavier than about 200 gev ( which we assume ) .",
    "the higgs sector is determined by adding the pseudo - scalar mass @xmath91 to the inputs , but basically decouples for large @xmath91 .",
    "the lep1 limit on the mass of the lightest neutral higgs boson @xmath92 is sufficient to ensure the @xmath13 and not @xmath93 . for each set of supersymmetric parameters ( each allowed `` model '' ) we calculate cross sections for chargino , neutralino and chargino - neutralino pair production at lep and tevatron , as well as the branching ratios of all charginos , neutralinos , and sleptons for every allowed channel .",
    "it is instructive to separate kinematic constraints from branching ratio constraints . in particular , the combined branching ratio increases as @xmath94 , but is virtually independent of @xmath54 .",
    "there is a weak dependence on @xmath18 , for which larger values tend to increase the mass difference between @xmath19 and @xmath20 , thus reducing the total branching ratio .",
    "the final set of @xmath0 event constraints on the neutralino lsp scenario is given in table  [ parameters - table ] .",
    "@xmath43 & @xmath52 + @xmath95 & @xmath96 + @xmath97 & @xmath98 + @xmath99 & @xmath100 + @xmath101 & @xmath102 + @xmath103 & @xmath104 + @xmath105 & @xmath106 + @xmath107 & @xmath108 + @xmath109 & @xmath110 + @xmath111 & @xmath112 + @xmath113 & @xmath114 + @xmath115 & @xmath116 + @xmath117 & @xmath118 + @xmath119 & @xmath120 +    the neutralino lsp interpretation with @xmath121 , higgsino - like @xmath12 , @xmath122 and @xmath22 is entirely satisfactory .",
    "it is remarkable that this is the same region of parameter space that provides a susy interpretation of the lep reported @xmath123 excess ( @xmath23 )  @xcite ; for that interpretation to be valid ( and assuming the @xmath23 discrepancy persists ) , the lightest stop must have a mass in the range 4580 gev and the branching ratio of top into the light stop must be greater than about 0.45 . if both @xmath23 and the @xmath0 event are considered then @xmath124 .",
    "the potential for observing the indirect production of stop from top decays in such a scenario was considered in e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there are a number of processes that must occur if the neutralino lsp interpretation is valid . figs .  [ sigma_n1n3],[sigma_c1n2 ] show the cross section for the most promising associated processes @xmath125 and @xmath85 production at the tevatron , where the total branching ratio for @xmath89 was required to be greater than 50% .",
    "the @xmath125 cross section is large and gives events such as @xmath126 with a signature @xmath127 , @xmath128 with a signature @xmath129 , or @xmath130 followed by @xmath131 with signature @xmath132 .",
    "the channel @xmath133 gives typically @xmath134 followed by @xmath135 with a signature @xmath136 ( @xmath137 and @xmath138 are suppressed because the @xmath122 and @xmath12 are higgsino - like ) .",
    "the @xmath139 channel gives @xmath140 , as does @xmath141 production .",
    "since we do not assume gaugino mass unification , we can not determine the gluino mass . if gaugino mass unification were approximately valid for @xmath20 and @xmath142 ( the non - abelian gaugino masses ) , then @xmath143 .",
    "however , we can mention a few channels with gluinos that could give observable rates .",
    "probably production of @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 will be significant .",
    "the @xmath147 could decay to @xmath148 or @xmath149 or , if @xmath90 is light enough , @xmath150 .",
    "in general , cascade decays through @xmath10 will lead to a nice signature of one or more hard @xmath151 s @xmath152 multijets @xmath153 .",
    "one nice signature is @xmath154 , another is @xmath155 .",
    "similar signatures can come from production of squark plus @xmath10 , e.g. @xmath156 ; the simplest unification arguments , which need not be valid , suggest @xmath157 ( except for @xmath158 which could be very light ) .",
    "the gravitational origins of the interactions of the gravitino might naively lead to the expectation that they can be neglected in collider experiments . however , it was originally pointed out by fayet  @xcite that the @xmath159 polarization states of the gravitino behave like a goldstino in global susy , and therefore have couplings to ( gauge boson , gaugino ) and ( scalar , chiral fermion ) which are inversely proportional to the gravitino mass . in the limit @xmath160 , the gravitino is obviously kinematically accessible and has large couplings , and so can have a profound effect on collider searches for susy  @xcite .",
    "a gravitino of mass less than about 10 kev avoids certain cosmological problems  @xcite .",
    "more recently , there has been theoretical impetus for the light gravitino coming from considerations of dynamical susy breaking  @xcite .",
    "one major point in favor of the hypothesis that @xmath27 in the @xmath0 event is the light gravitino is that the kinematics with @xmath161 allows the selectron to be as light as 80 gev , with a correspondingly larger production cross section .",
    "furthermore , with the mass ordering @xmath162 or @xmath50 the branching fraction should be essentially 100% , with no other adjustment of parameters required .",
    "if the lightest neutralino is the second - lightest supersymmetric particle , it nearly always decays through the 2-body mode @xmath163 .",
    "( the 3-body decays @xmath164 can also occur , mediated by a virtual z or a virtual sfermion @xmath165 or higgs scalar , but are suppressed .",
    "if @xmath166 then the two - body decay @xmath167 might occur with @xmath168 , but in any case this is suppressed by both phase space and mixing angles if @xmath12 is gaugino - like . )",
    "if the gravitino is light enough , this means that susy signatures will often include two hard photons plus missing energy .",
    "the contribution to the neutralino decay width is given by  @xcite ( _ i g ) = 1.12 10 ^ -11 where in the notation of  @xcite @xmath169 .",
    "if this decay width is too small , @xmath12 will decay outside the detector , and the signature for any given event would be the same as in the usual mssm . in terms of its energy , the decay distance of @xmath12 is given by d = 1.76 10 ^ -3 ^-1_1 ( e^2_/m^2 _ - 1)^1/2 the maximum @xmath82 which fits the kinematic and cross - sectional criteria of the event is not much larger than 100 gev , so we find a very rough upper limit of 250 ev on the gravitino mass , by requiring @xmath170 cm .",
    "this limit is decreased by an order of magnitude for smaller @xmath82 .",
    "if @xmath171 ev for @xmath172 , the kinematic analysis described earlier is not valid in detail , since the @xmath173 decay length is significant on the scale of the cdf detector .",
    "however , within this range it is still true that the event is consistent with a light gravitino .",
    "the constraints on the allowed mssm parameter space in this scenario are essentially just those which follow from the kinematics discussed above .",
    "the light gravitino interpretation suggests several other signatures which can be searched for at the tevatron and lep-2 . if the gravitino is  superlight \" ( @xmath174 ev ) , processes with associated production of gravitinos become important . at both lep and the tevatron ,",
    "one has the possibilities of @xmath175 and @xmath176 production , leading to signatures @xmath177 and @xmath178 or @xmath179 respectively .",
    "the non - observation of @xmath177 events in @xmath180 decays at lep1 probes ( albeit in a quite mixing angle - dependent way ) values of @xmath181 up to about @xmath182 ev , for @xmath183  @xcite .",
    "( one might also have a single photon signature in the neutralino lsp scenario , from @xmath184 production , but this seems to be strongly disfavored by the mixing angle requirements . ) at hadron colliders , one can have @xmath185 @xcite production .",
    "if @xmath186 ev and squarks are very heavy , @xmath147 can decay dominantly into @xmath187 with a monojet signature , although the signal will probably be below background unless @xmath188 .",
    "another possibility is @xmath189 production with the signature @xmath127 or @xmath179 .",
    "other signals which can occur either at the tevatron or lep-2 should contain 2 energetic photons ( assuming that one takes the @xmath0 event as establishing that @xmath190 occurs within the detector at least a large fraction of the time ) .",
    "one obvious signal is @xmath191 , which will follow from @xmath192 or @xmath193 production .",
    "the signal @xmath194 can occur from either @xmath195 or @xmath196 production .",
    "the @xmath139 and @xmath44 modes are unavoidable if the @xmath0 event is due to @xmath43 pair production .",
    "it should be noted that in the light gravitino scenario , there are actually several processes that can lead to the signature @xmath197 ; besides the obvious @xmath198 and @xmath199 , one has also @xmath200 production or even @xmath201 or @xmath202 ( although it seems more difficult to reconcile these possibilities with the observed kinematics of the @xmath0 event ) . in the cases of @xmath201 and @xmath202 production , the two leptons in the signature need not be the same flavor .",
    "one also has @xmath203 from either @xmath204 or @xmath205 production .",
    "another possible discovery signature is @xmath206 following from either @xmath207 or @xmath195 production . in general",
    ", one can search for any of the usual susy signatures with an additional pair of energetic photons ( one from each @xmath12 decay ) .",
    "if @xmath208 is accessible , it can lead to the usual multijet @xmath209 signal , but with 2 energetic photons .",
    "if a stop is light , another possibility is the production of @xmath210 , followed by @xmath211 , that gives a signature @xmath212 at the tevatron , and does not seem to have a counterpart for the neutralino lsp scenario .",
    "each of the signatures listed above can occur also with only one hard photon if @xmath213 is comparable to the size of the detector , allowing one of the two decays @xmath17 to be missed .",
    "while the neutralino lsp interpretation and the light gravitino interpretation both predict signatures with 2 energetic photons and @xmath214 , the rates and kinematics will be different and so may eventually be used to distinguish them .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath181 is in the upper part of the range favored by dynamical supersymmetry breaking @xcite , it is not unlikely that the decay length @xmath213 can eventually be measured in the detector . while we were preparing this paper ,",
    "two papers  @xcite have appeared which discuss light gravitino signals inspired by dynamical supersymmetry breaking .",
    "in constraining the parameters of the supersymmetric lagrangian ( e.g. superpartner masses and couplings ) , we imposed present lep11.3 constraints and found a region of parameter space that can explain the @xmath0 event with correct kinematics and cross section .",
    "selectron pair - production is never allowed at lep1.3 , since the kinematics of the @xmath0 event forces @xmath33 .",
    "the light neutralino pair - production processes are suppressed for dynamical reasons . indeed , although it is possible that @xmath215 , invisible @xmath216 decays give a contribution to @xmath217 below the experimental sensitivity , since @xmath70 and the coupling @xmath218 is suppressed like @xmath219 when @xmath220 .",
    "furthermore , even if @xmath221 is below 130 gev , the @xmath222 pair production is strongly depleted ( to the level of a few fb ) at lep1.3 by the absence of @xmath223 and @xmath224 ( @xmath225 ) couplings in the theory .",
    "finally , @xmath226 production is either kinematically forbidden or , where allowed , it is negligible at lep1.3 , since @xmath227 pairs can only be produced by t - channel @xmath228-exchange and @xmath229 is sufficiently large to suppress this rate .",
    "the main constraints from non - observation of supersymmetric events at lep1.3 are from @xmath85 production .",
    "the @xmath230 is in general a mixture @xmath231 , with dominant `` antisymmetric''-higgsino @xmath71 component and it can be easily produced in association with @xmath232 through s - channel @xmath180-exchange .",
    "since the presence of the @xmath0 event is not compatible with high values of @xmath233 ( see table  [ parameters - table ] ) , one has to choose @xmath234 values large enough to push @xmath83 close to or above the threshold . in particular , we require @xmath235 pb at lep1.3 ( after an evaluation of the initial - state radiation effects ) , leading to a very small ( less than 10 ) total number of @xmath85 events expected in the data of an ideal lep1.3 `` hermetic '' detector .",
    "further , about 20% of these events are invisible because of the @xmath236 branching ratio . at lep1.3",
    ", @xmath85 production is kinematically forbidden for some ranges of masses , while charginos are too heavy to be detected ( see table  [ parameters - table ] ) .    in the following ,",
    "we discuss the phenomenology at two future phases of lep with energies @xmath237 , 190 gev and an expected luminosity of about 10 , 500 @xmath8 respectively . at lep190 , although selectron - pair production is out of reach , we expect clear and visible supersymmetric signals from light neutralinos and charginos .",
    "the dynamical suppression of the @xmath200 production is still effective ( giving a total rate of the order of 10 fb both at lep160 and lep190 ) and the radiative channel @xmath238  @xcite should remain well below the @xmath239 sm background for the same reason the @xmath216 channel is suppressed at lep1 .",
    "the @xmath226 production is also suppressed by @xmath229 and is always well below the visibility threshold at lep160 for the expected integrated luminosity [ @xmath240 pb ] .",
    "some interesting signals from this channel are possible at lep190 when @xmath241 gev leading to production rates for @xmath226 production through @xmath228 exchange at the level of hundreds of events , with a distinctive @xmath242 large @xmath243 signature .",
    "the most promising channels are again @xmath85 production and @xmath84 production .",
    "nevertheless , the cross section for the former is generally below 2 pb at lep160 ( because of the normal drop of the s - channel contribution when one goes away from the @xmath180 peak ) and might not be large enough for detection ; nevertheless the large integrated luminosity at lep190 should allow one to disentangle this supersymmetric signal from the background ( see fig .",
    "[ lep_sigma_n1n3 ] ) .",
    "the total cross section for @xmath244 is of the order of 11.5 pb at @xmath245 gev for the whole region of the parameter space suggested by the @xmath0 event .",
    "we checked that initial - state radiation effects can deplete the cross section at lep160 by at most 20% , and are generally not significant at lep190 .",
    "the large higgsino component of the @xmath230 makes the coupling @xmath246 generally dominant over @xmath247 and those involving sfermions , while the decay channels @xmath248 or @xmath249 ( though dynamically enhanced by a large charged higgsino component in @xmath122 ) , have in general little available phase space [ low @xmath250 .",
    "hence , the main signature will be @xmath251 , where @xmath252 refers to a pair of jets ( branching ratio about 60 - 65% ) or charged leptons ( branching ratio about 2 - 3% per family ) .",
    "this signal , of course , has to compete with a large @xmath253 sm background , but should allow a confirmation or refutation of the neutralino lsp scenario .",
    "the cross section for chargino pair production depends on the sneutrino exchange contribution , interfering destructively with the @xmath180-exchange contribution .",
    "if the @xmath0 event is a result of @xmath254 production , then the sneutrino mass is not constrained , hence the cross section is not uniquely determined by the chargino mass .",
    "we find the maximum cross section for @xmath84 production at lep160 is about 3 pb when @xmath81 is close to its minimum allowed value and @xmath51 is large .",
    "however , larger chargino masses ( above the threshold of lep160 ) are not excluded in the neutralino lsp scenario .",
    "if the @xmath0 event is from @xmath255 , then @xmath51 is fixed by @xmath256 and the sum rule given previously , with a range determined by @xmath18 .",
    "we find that @xmath84 detection is unlikely at lep160 because the cross section is always below 1.5 pb , since the sneutrino is light . at lep190 ,",
    "the cross section is always at least 0.5 pb and the chargino should be detectable with the expected integrated luminosity .",
    "for the signature one has to distinguish between two completely different cases , with the stop lighter or heavier than the chargino . in the light",
    "stop case ( @xmath257 ) one has always @xmath258 , followed by @xmath131 , with @xmath259 resulting signature . in the other case , since the @xmath122 is mainly charged higgsino , the dominant channel is @xmath260 ( about 6065% ) or @xmath261 ( 1012% for each lepton @xmath262,@xmath54,@xmath55 ) through a virtual @xmath263 ( when open , @xmath264 is also disfavored by kinematics ) .",
    "so the main signatures are @xmath265 or @xmath266 , @xmath267 .",
    "thus , lep160 might see superpartners , but the neutralino lsp interpretation of the @xmath0 event can not be excluded by non - observation . however , lep190 should detect @xmath268 and/or @xmath84 ( and probably also @xmath226 ) pairs , thus confirming or excluding the neutralino lsp scenario .",
    "we have seen that the selectron interpretation of the @xmath0 event can be made in two different supersymmetric scenarios , which ultimately have different sources of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "the generalized mssm with a neutralino lsp can accommodate the event if @xmath269 and @xmath22 ; gaugino mass unification can not be satisfied .",
    "these constraints do not apply in the light gravitino scenario .",
    "it is interesting that in the neutralino lsp scenario both the @xmath0 event and the susy interpretation of @xmath23 independently push the parameters into the same region of parameter space , as discussed in the text .",
    "it is unnecessary to emphasize the importance of the cdf @xmath0 event if it is indeed from selectron production .",
    "it is presently possible to maintain a supersymmetric interpretation even when the event is examined in detail .",
    "we will describe the details of the model building , parameter space constraints , and many aspects of collider predictions for both the neutralino lsp scenario and the light gravitino scenario in a larger paper  @xcite .",
    "our main goal here is to argue that if the interpretation is correct , then a number of other events must occur at the tevatron , and some at lep190 .",
    "if none of these are observed , it would rule out the supersymmetric interpretation of the @xmath0 event as selectron production . while some of the signatures can have backgrounds",
    ", the combination of one or more hard photons with missing energy implies the background rates are probably not large .",
    "if the confirming events are there , then most other superpartners are being produced at fermilab , and some will be produced at lep190 .",
    "luminosity at the tevatron and lep should lead to the opportunity to detect of a number of these important states .",
