    "one early consensus after the discovery of the high @xmath1 superconducting cuprates , is that the key to understanding these materials is the @xmath0 planes common to all of them .",
    "however , after two decades of intense study , there is no consensus understanding yet of the origin of superconductivity from this feature .",
    "interestingly , it was experimentally demonstrated early enough that when the parent material is doped , the mobile holes reside on the o site of this plane .",
    "this led to the suggestion that a three - band hubbard model ( @xmath2 ) in which the hole is mobile and carry a spin should be the starting point to investigate these material @xcite . in a seminal paper @xcite , zhang and",
    "rice suggested that this hole on the o site will form a singlet state with a hole on the cu site at the central of each @xmath0 plaquette to form a single - band character .",
    "this is the mapping of the @xmath2 into the single - band hubbard model ( @xmath3 ) when @xmath4 which is consistent with the anderson s proposal that a strong on - site coulomb interaction among a partially filled band of cu 3d levels should be the starting effective single - band model for the supeconducting cuprates .",
    "since then , the researchers who follow this line of thinking @xcite believe the ground states of the @xmath0 are the zhang - rice singlet ( zrs ) which are expected to become the cooper pairs of the superconducting states when liberated from the insulating host material .",
    "however , there have been opposing views on the equivalence of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 and also that the added holes do not hybridize into a zrs @xcite .",
    "these views may need some reconsideration in the wake of recent experiments @xcite and calculations @xcite which have demonstrated the existence of the zrs .",
    "meanwhile among the workers starting from the zrs , there is still no consensus on the appropriate parameters to add to the t - j model to obtain an effective hamiltonian for the superconducting cuprates @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the effects of these parameters even in first principle calculations , depend on the starting @xmath5 configuration .",
    "it follows then that a simplified determination of the possible configuration at a phenomenological level but not bias to experimental results can give useful insight into the starting structure of the @xmath0 .",
    "this is the purpose of this paper . +",
    "interestingly the zrs is obviously a two - hole state @xcite and this makes it straightforward for us to apply to the @xmath0 planes our recently developed formulation of the statistical equivalent of the hubbard ( t - u and @xmath6 ) model using a highly simplified correlated variational approach ( hscva)@xcite . the simplicity of this approach makes it easy to give useful insight on how the competition between itineracy and localization in strongly correlated systems could lead to the exciting properties in these systems in @xmath7 . in the present formulation , it will be shown how the competition between the motion of a single - hole in the the @xmath0 planes and its hybridization with the cu can lead to a @xmath3 model .",
    "in particular , the approach emphasizes the zrs as the ground states of the @xmath0 planes and that it can be propagated as a probable cooper channel in the @xmath0 structure within the t - j hamiltonian for the supeconducting cuprates .",
    "it is generally believed that the undoped superconducting cuprates is a mott insulator at half - filling ( one electron per site ) . in this state ,",
    "the system is more stable because the electron are reluctant to hop in order to avoid the price of occupying the same site ( i.e u ) .",
    "thus the starting @xmath0 is viewed as a valence state of @xmath8 and @xmath9 with a hole at the cu site .",
    "one way to induce electronic motion is to create an electronic vacancy on the o site which is often called a hole .",
    "this free hole attracts an electron of another o which in turn creates a vacancy in its place and this new vacancy will attract another electron and so on .",
    "thus by this first electron removal ( fer ) approach , the electron can hop from one o site to another , but in doing so , the hole is also hopping from one point to another and this is often referred to as the hole motion . as stated above , the formulation in @xcite assumes that the zrs is formed from the hybridization of a hole on each square of o atoms to the central cu to form the local singlet .",
    "it follows that this fer approach to investigate the propagation of a single hole in the @xmath0 plane is a natural starting point to investigate the superconducting cuprates and the zrs states are believed to be the theoretical construction of the fer states in photoemission experiments @xcite .",
    "+ in the theoretical construction here , we start from the @xmath2 scenario by assuming all four possible cu - o hybridized states in a plaquette . since only one hole is present in the fer approach , it is argued that only one of the hybridized states will be present at any given time to form an effective singlet of each plaquette .",
    "therefore this effective singlet retain the zrs nature of the @xmath0 structure in the fer approach .",
    "the non - triviality of this consideration to the formation here will be made clear below .",
    "+     cuprtates showing the @xmath0 planes ( b ) the @xmath0 plaquette as a 1d ring of o around the cu so that there is no edge effect hence have periodic boundaries ( c ) hole doping leading to propagation of the zrs in the @xmath0 planes.,title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=377 ]    following the steps in @xcite , the basis states of the @xmath0 plaquatte in a three - band configuration from fig .",
    "1b are , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , where the @xmath14 and @xmath15 represent the spins defined by @xmath16 . in numerical index ,",
    "a state can be represented in general with the first site for cu and the second site for o as @xmath17 where ( ii ) means there is a particle at the site i that can possibly be in the ( x , y ) direction .",
    "then the state @xmath10 becomes @xmath18 where i = 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , ...",
    "n is the index number of cu sites .",
    "it is worthy to note that the notation used here in the configuration of the hybridized states is for convenience of the approach and do not differ from the common ones in the literature .",
    "further more , this configuration combined with the periodicity of the @xmath0 structure implies the eigenstates of the @xmath0 plane are eigenstates of the translational operator , @xmath19 , and this gives a recipe to construct translationally invariant basis states with additional fixed quantum number , @xmath20 which will become important to extend the simple approach here in future communication .",
    "+ the @xmath0 plane is a quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) structure and therefore requires the use of the 2d kinetic operator , @xmath21 , which for a general state , @xmath17 say , yields the excited states simply by adding and subtracting one appropriately @xcite , @xmath22,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where -t is the nearest neigbour ( nn ) hopping matrix . + it has been shown @xcite that the variational ground state energy @xmath23 for the model hamiltonian h = @xmath21 ( i.e eq .",
    "1 ) will yield a matrix @xmath24=0\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the total ground state energy spectrum which can be obtained by diagonalization of eq .",
    "( 3 ) and its smallest value is the ground state energy of the systems .",
    "the @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) is the separation between the sites in a basis state written in compact form , @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the new separation of the excited state obtained and t is the number of such excited states with @xmath28 for an operation on any of the basis states .",
    "we emphasize that since the cu - o distances in the plane are the same @xcite , the separation depends only on the direction .",
    "+ it is easy to show by diagonalising eq . (",
    "3 ) for a hubbard square lattice that the ground state energy is the same as the bandwidth w = -8 ev = 2zt ( for t = -1 ) where z = 4 is the coordination number .",
    "however , eq . ( 1 )",
    "needs to be modified for the hole motion in the @xmath0 plane . for",
    "as it is obvious in fig 1b , the motion is periodic in 1d since the o sites form a ring around the cu .",
    "an immediate question is why not use the i d hopperer ?",
    "this is not possible because the basis states are 2d .",
    "thus we see right from the beginning of this formation why the quasi 2d nature of the @xmath0 plane make the bandwidth of the superconducting cuprates to be smaller than w = 2zt @xcite",
    "( 1 ) for the i d hole motion in the @xmath0 plane can be expressed as @xmath29,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 and @xmath31 and @xmath32 is for o - o hopping .",
    "+ then taking eq ( 4 ) into account in eq .",
    "( 2 ) will result to a 4 x 4 matrix in eq .",
    "( 3 ) which when diagonalisd will yield w = -2 ev .",
    "this means the bandwidth of the non - interacting case of the @xmath0 plane is @xmath33 smaller than that of a normal hubbard square .",
    "this narrow band is a key feature in the high @xmath1 superconducting cuprates because it is crucial in determining all the possible hopping and interacting parameters that will contribute to the properties of these materials and hence the model hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "+ now if we take into account the assumption made above to retain the zrs in the fer approach , eq .",
    "( 4 ) can be expressed in second quantization language as @xmath34,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the creation ( annihilation ) of a hole at the @xmath36 orbital and @xmath37 is the creation ( annihilation ) of a hole at the @xmath38 and @xmath39 orbitals , h.c .",
    "is the hermitian conjugate while @xmath40 denotes @xmath41 $ ] with r = ( x , y ) and @xmath42 .",
    "+ it is seen immediately that @xmath43 is the kinetic operator of the t - j model @xcite .",
    "+ the beauty of the hscva is that one can start the investigation by obtaining the bandwidth of the non - interacting case .",
    "thereafter one can introduce the desired interactions and monitor their effects .",
    "as stated above , the on - site coulomb interaction of of the cu holes is considered in @xcite to be very large , @xmath44 .",
    "they therefore considered only the exchange interaction between the cu and o with exchange matrix , @xmath45 .",
    "the physical implication of this interaction is that as the singlet state propagates , there is also an exchange of spins between the cu and o. thus a spin exchange distributor , @xmath46 which add and subtract one spin appropriately to the spins of the basis states will lead to new states which are just the antisymmetric states of the basis states , @xmath47 where @xmath48.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eq .",
    "( 7 ) is the xy limit of the anisotropic heisenberg exchange interaction in second quantization language @xcite , and it is the interacting part of the t - j model in the @xmath0 plane with zrs . taking eq .",
    "( 7 ) into account in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , eq .",
    "( 3 ) becomes @xmath49=0.\\ ] ] where @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 being the gutzwiller renormalization factors for the kinetic operator and superexchange interactions .",
    "the inclusion of these factors is to account for the effect of strong correlations . for in deriving eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 7 ) , the arguement in @xcite has to be invoked that since the cu on - site coulombic interaction is strong , @xmath53 , we will have projected fermions @xmath54 which do not obey the usual commutation rule for free fermions . however , taking into account the gutzwiller approximation , the renormarlized fermions becomes @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 with x denoting the level of concentration of holes . thus the effective hamiltonian is a combination of eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 7 ) with the inclusion of the renormalization factors , @xmath58",
    "to observe the role of the exchange interactions in comparison with eq .",
    "( 3 ) , eq .",
    "( 8) is diagonalized at various values of @xmath59 and @xmath45 without the strong correlations effect for now ; it is observed that the exchange interactions has a band narrowing effect @xcite .",
    "for example , the common values in the literature @xcite , @xmath59 = 0.4 ev and @xmath45 = 0.12 ev , gives w = -1.70 ev while the experimental value of about 1 ev for the @xmath0 structure @xcite can be obtained from the unrealistic value @xmath60 = 1.0 .",
    "however , the inclusion of the strong correlations effect by appropriate doping can be used to correct this defect as @xmath61 1 ev for @xmath62 for the common values ( @xmath60 = 0.3 ) and @xmath61 1 ev for @xmath63 for @xmath60 = 0.2 .",
    "this is quite encouraging as it has been earlier demostrated that the gutzwiller projected d - wave pairing state is most stable for @xmath64 @xcite which is a fair generalization since that of the cuprates is only stable up to @xmath63 generically @xcite .",
    "the only exception is the y - ba - cu - o samples which has an additional 1d cu - o chains that plays a role but is not taken into account in most calculations in 2d model .",
    "thus the emphasis here is that our formulation has shown that appropraite doping of correctly chosen @xmath0 configuration within the t - j model may lead to results in fair agreement with experiments .",
    "it is important to point out that over the years , several sophisticated techniques have been used to investigate the inclusion of additional hopping and interaction parameters beyond the t - j model to achieve the experimental value .",
    "though these studies have contributed to enhanced understanding , there is still no consensus on what parameters should constitute the effective hamiltonian to study the high @xmath1 superconducting cuprates . as stated above , the reason may be due to the starting @xmath0 configuration .",
    "the most probable @xmath0 configuration is therefore analyzed here .",
    "+ it is assumed that the hole is created at the o site @xmath65 as shown in fig .",
    "( 1c ) where the thick spin are before exchange interactions and the dotted spin are after the exchange interactions .",
    "therefore two hybridized dotted spins indicates a zrs and hence is used here as indicative of the zrs propagation . from the kinetic part of eq .",
    "( 5 ) , the hole from the @xmath65 will hop to @xmath66 position of the o site between plaquettes 1 and 2 .",
    "it can then form a zrs with the cu in plaquette 1 .",
    "but due to the non - orthogonality of the plaquettes and the equidistance of the cu - o , it can also form a triplet state with plaquette 2 @xcite . however ,",
    "this is less likely because the zrs hybridization is stronger and consequently more favoured @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the zrs hybridization in plaquette 1 leads to spontaneous exchange of spins from the interaction part of eq .",
    "therefore the effective hole seen by the cu in plaquette 2 has an opposite spin so that eq .",
    "( 9 ) become effective in forming new zrs in this plaquette , resulting in a scenario in which the effective bound state forming the zrs is propagated from one plaquette to another in the t - j model and thereby constitute a probable cooper channel . this mode of formation and propagation of the zrs",
    "is supported by the observation in @xcite that the critical @xmath1 of the superconducting cuprates depends on the number of @xmath0 planes within a short distance of each other in the structure .",
    "+ now the above description looks superficially rather too simplified to explain all the intriguing properties of the high @xmath1 in the suerconducting cuprates oweing to the present sophistication of the literature which unknowingly may have become part of the complex nature of these materials .",
    "it is therefore necessary to emphasize that the mechanism proposed here do not rule out the effects of the other parameters and the influence of electron - phonon interactions from displacement of the atoms @xcite .",
    "for example , the spontaneous spin exchange between the o and cu in one plaquette usually leads to virtual superexchange between the nn cu atoms .",
    "interestingly , such effects have been included as cu - cu exchange interactions and sometimes also as constituting additional hopping term @xmath67 in attempts to account for experimental data in several studies @xcite .",
    "thus it is hoped that the formulation here gives the underlying physics of zrs propagation in the @xmath0 planes which can lead to more accurate investigation with methods that allow unbiased treatment of necessary parameters .",
