    "in the last fifty years , the physics of disordered systems has turned out to be tremendously rich , and the field is still offering challenging and unexpected results . among those ,",
    "the manifestations of weak and strong ( anderson ) localization of coherent waves are paradigmatic examples @xcite . in practice ,",
    "anderson localization very often manifests itself as a halt of wave transport .",
    "this signature has been largely exploited in a number of experiments searching for anderson localization of classical waves in disordered media @xcite or of matter waves subjected to time - periodic @xcite and random @xcite optical potentials . at the same time , recent works @xcite pointed out that in ultracold - atom setups , the momentum distribution of a matter wave in a random potential can exhibit a highly nontrivial dynamics due to localization if it is initially launched with a nonzero mean wave - vector @xmath0 .",
    "the scenario is then the following .",
    "first , over a time scale of the order of the boltzmann transport mean free time @xmath1 , an isotropization of the distribution takes place as particles momenta are being randomized by the disorder @xcite . during this process",
    ", a narrow coherent backscattering ( cbs ) peak emerges around the direction @xmath2 .",
    "after a few @xmath1 , this peak gains a maximum visibility and sits on top of a broader isotropic , ring - shaped distribution @xcite . at a later time",
    ", a second interference peak appears in the forward direction @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the visibility of this coherent forward scattering ( cfs ) peak increases slowly , and finally reaches a maximum value at a time of the order of the heisenberg time @xmath4 , defined as the inverse of the mean spacing between the energy levels of the system ( see below for a more precise discussion ) . beyond @xmath4 ,",
    "the system no longer evolves and the asymptotic distribution has the central symmetry ( if time - reversal invariance is preserved ) , with two identical cbs and cfs peaks .",
    "experimentally , the cbs effect of ultracold atoms has been recently observed @xcite , motivating further investigations like the sensitivity of cbs to external dephasing @xcite .",
    "an observation of the cfs effect is , on the other hand , still missing . from a theoretical point of view , while the physics of cbs is today well understood ",
    "it stems from wave amplitudes travelling along the same multiple scattering sequence but in opposite directions @xcite  the mechanism of cfs is much less obvious .",
    "in fact , the building of the cfs peak relies on interference sequences where particles are scattered back and forth several times between the directions @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "while this mechanism is inefficient in a purely diffusive system , it becomes strongly enhanced when the wave gets confined in a limited region of space : wave interference can then accumulate and make the cfs peak macroscopic .",
    "the situation typically occurs in an infinite system if anderson localization comes into play ( this was the scenario originally considered in @xcite ) , but also , as discussed in the present paper , when the wave is trapped within a limited region of space of size smaller than the localization length . in this respect ,",
    "a full characterization of the cfs effect is required in order to unambiguously attribute its appearance to anderson localization .    in this paper , we present a detailed study of the momentum distribution of a matter wave launched in a random potential , bringing special attention to the cfs effect to which we propose a systematic numerical analysis combined with theoretical predictions .",
    "we consider a random potential of speckle type , routinely used in current experiments with ultracold atoms @xcite , and focus on the two - dimensional ( 2d ) geometry for which the cfs peak clearly distinguishes itself from the isotropic part of the momentum distribution @xcite ( we refer the reader to @xcite for the one - dimensional and quasi one - dimensional cases ) .",
    "the main concepts discussed in the paper as well as the theoretical framework are introduced in sec .",

    "[ sectionl ] , we analyze the building up of the cfs peak for a matter wave scattered diffusively in a limited volume of size much smaller than the localization length of the problem , @xmath5 . then , in sec .",
    "[ sectionxi ] , we address the more difficult but more interesting case @xmath6 where the cfs peak is triggered by the confinement of the matter wave stemming from anderson localization . this configuration is typically the one of experiments , where an atomic wave packet is initially prepared and evolves in the presence of the disorder , without any confining box .",
    "this experimental scenario , studied in sec .",
    "[ feasibility ] , has however two additional ingredients : ( i ) the matter wave has a broad energy distribution for which both localized and diffusive atoms coexist and ( ii ) the initial state has a finite spatial width , affecting the shape and height of the cfs peak .",
    "despite these complications , we show that , in the absence of an artificial confining box , the diffusive components studied in sec .  [ sectionl ] do not contribute to the cfs signal , and that the latter can be observed and used as a `` smoking gun '' of anderson localization . in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] , we finally summarize our results and discuss some open questions .",
    "in order to introduce the physics discussed in the paper , let us first consider a simple numerical experiment .",
    "we start from a plane matter wave @xmath7 and propagate it with the evolution operator @xmath8 , where @xmath9 with @xmath10 a 2d random potential ( from here on we set @xmath11 ) . following recent experiments on ultracold atoms ,",

    "this potential is numerically generated in a standard way , by convoluting a circular gaussian random field with a cutoff function that simulates the diffusive plate used in experiments @xcite .",
    "as soon as the random potential is turned on , @xmath0 is no longer a good quantum number and the system starts to evolve .",
    "the time propagation is achieved on a 2d grid of size @xmath15 with periodic boundary conditions along @xmath16 and @xmath17 , by using an iterative method based on the expansion of the evolution operator in combinations of chebyshev polynomials of the hamiltonian @xcite . in the simulations , a cell of surface @xmath18",
    "is discretized in typically 8 - 10 steps along both @xmath16 and @xmath17 . after the evolution ,",
