    "neutrino masses , baryogenesis , dark matter and the acoustic peaks in the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation require an extension of the standard model of particle physics . the supersymmetric standard model with right - handed neutrinos and spontaneously broken @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 , the difference of baryon and lepton number , provides a minimal framework which can account for all these phenomena @xcite .",
    "@xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 breaking at the grand unification ( gut ) scale leads to an elegant explanation of the small neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism and explains baryogenesis via leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle is an excellent candidate for dark matter @xcite and the spontaneous breaking of @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 requires an extended scalar sector , which automatically yields hybrid inflation @xcite , explaining the inhomogeneities of the cmb .",
    "recently , we have suggested that the decay of a false vacuum of unbroken @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 symmetry generates the initial conditions of the hot early universe : nonthermal and thermal processes produce an abundance of heavy neutrinos whose decays generate primordial entropy , baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis and gravitino dark matter from scatterings in the thermal bath @xcite . in this context , tachyonic preheating after hybrid inflation  @xcite sets the stage for a matter dominated phase whose evolution is described by boltzmann equations , finally resulting in a radiation dominated phase .",
    "it is remarkable that the initial conditions of this radiation dominated phase are not free parameters but are determined by the parameters of a lagrangian , which in principle can be measured by particle physics experiments and astrophysical observations .",
    "our work is closely related to previous studies of thermal leptogenesis @xcite and nonthermal leptogenesis via inflaton decay @xcite , where the inflaton lifetime determines the reheating temperature . in supersymmetric models with global @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 symmetry",
    "the scalar superpartner @xmath5 of the lightest heavy majorana neutrino @xmath6 can play the role of the inflaton in chaotic @xcite or hybrid @xcite inflation models .",
    "one of the main motivations for nonthermal leptogenesis has been that the ` gravitino problem ' for heavy unstable gravitinos @xcite can be avoided by means of a low reheating temperature . in the following",
    "we shall assume that the gravitino is the lightest superparticle .",
    "gravitino dark matter can then be thermally produced at a reheating temperature compatible with leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "the present work is an extension of ref .",
    "we discuss in detail the effect of all supersymmetric degrees of freedom on the reheating process and restrict the parameters of the lagrangian such that they are compatible with hybrid inflation and the production of cosmic strings during spontaneous symmetry breaking .",

    "the consistency of hybrid inflation , leptogenesis and gravitino dark matter entails an interesting connection between the lightest neutrino mass @xmath7 and the gravitino mass @xmath8 .",
    "as we shall see , the final results for baryon asymmetry and dark matter are rather insensitive to the effects of superparticles and details of the reheating process . due to the restrictions on the parameter space",
    "compared to ref .  @xcite the lower bound on the gravitino mass increases to about @xmath4 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec_2 ]",
    "we briefly recall field content and superpotential of our model , in particular the froggatt - nielsen flavour structure on which our analysis is based .",
    "we then discuss the time - dependent masses of all particles during the spontaneous breaking of @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 symmetry in the supersymmetric abelian higgs model , the restrictions of hybrid inflation and cosmic strings on the parameters , and the particle abundances produced during tachyonic preheating .",
    "section  [ sec_tools ] deals with the time evolution after preheating and the required set of boltzmann equations for all particles and superparticles .",
    "the detailed description of the reheating process is given in section  [ sec : example ] with emphasis on the various contributions to the abundance of @xmath6 neutrinos , the lightest of the heavy majorana neutrinos , whose decays eventually generate entropy and baryon asymmetry .",

    "@xcite , we find that the fraction of energy stored in cosmic strings directly after the phase transition increases strongly with the coupling parameter @xmath23 . this is due to the higher energy density per cosmic string as well as the shorter average distance between two strings .",

    ".   implies @xmath116 and a factor of proportionality of about 5 .",
    "this is still consistent with the froggatt - nielsen model , since three @xmath41 factors enter in the calculation of @xmath18 .",

    "the chosen range easily covers the expected values for @xmath54 in this setup , cf .",
    "@xcite for a recent analysis .",
    "the production and decay of cosmic strings can in principle have a large influence on the state of the universe just after the phase transition . however , as we will argue in the following , for our purposes it is not necessary to treat these processes in detail , as long as we restrict ourselves to the parameter space in eq .  .",
    "according to eq .  , it is possible to have as much as @xmath119 cosmic strings per hubble volume for large values of the coupling parameter @xmath23 . for the maximal value of the coupling constant , @xmath102 , roughly half of the total energy density just after the phase transition is stored in cosmic strings .",
    "however , since in this case the relaxation time of the cosmic strings , @xmath120 , is much smaller than a hubble time , the major component of this energy has been converted back into higgs and gauge degrees of freedom before the processes which we describe by means of boltzmann equations , cf .",
    "section  [ sec_mssm ] , become relevant .",
    "since the exact mechanism of energy loss of cosmic strings is not yet fully understood , we will in the following omit the effects from cosmic strings , keeping in mind that at the very most , they will convert about half of the initial energy density of the higgs bosons into particles of the higgs and gauge multiplets .",
    "typically the effects from cosmic strings are much less important , e.g. for @xmath121 their relative energy contribution is at the level of at most @xmath122 . due to supersymmetry",
    ", the extra higgsinos produced will decay into the same supermultiplet as the higgs bosons would have , thus inducing no significant change in the following discussion .",
    "the extra gauge particles will decay predominantly into radiation , which is quickly diluted at this early stage of the matter dominated phase governed by the nonrelativistic higgs bosons .",
    "thus it can be expected that our setup is insensitive to a modification of the contribution from cosmic strings to the initial conditions of the following reheating phase .",
    "we also confirmed this in a numerical study .",
    "considering the case of extremal string production , we shifted half of the energy initially stored in the higgs bosons at the end of preheating into the gauge degrees of freedom and calculated the resulting entropy , baryon asymmetry and gravitino dark matter .",
    "we find no deviations from the results presented in section  [ sec : example ] above the percent level .",
    "let us now consider the production of particles coupled to the higgs field . as the value of the inflaton field decreases , the scalar potential develops a tachyonic instability in the direction of the higgs field .",
    "quantum fluctuations of the higgs field @xmath123 with wave number @xmath124 begin to grow exponentially , while its average value remains zero .",
    "the strong population of the long wavelength higgs modes leads to a large abundance of nonrelativistic higgs bosons .",
    "other particles coupled to the higgs field are nonperturbatively produced due to the rapid change of their effective masses  @xcite .",

    "according to ref .",

    "just as the higgs bosons themselves , these particles are produced with very low momentum , i.e.  nonrelativistically .",
    "a deviation from this mechanism is found for the imaginary component @xmath72 of the complex field @xmath131 , since fixing the gauge to unitary gauge yields a constant contribution to its mass . neglecting the expansion of the universe , the mode equation for @xmath72 reads @xmath132 we can absorb the constant mass contribution in the momentum @xmath133 . in the language of ref .",

    ", we extended the summation over the final states to include the lepton number conserving processes .",
    "these can be grouped in pairs of @xmath209 conjugates and hence , due to @xmath209 invariance , yield a vanishing contribution in total . in the third line , we exploit the unitarity of the @xmath598 matrix , i.e.  that the summation over all possible final states yields 1 .",
    "since however in eq .",
    "the sum runs only over all possible two - particle final states , we obtain corrections caused by neglecting multi - particle final states . for",
    "off - shell intermediate states these corrections are of @xmath605 @xcite , however close to the resonance pole they are enhanced to @xmath606  @xcite .    concluding , we find that the @xmath9-violating contributions of the @xmath208 scattering processes involved in the production of the lepton asymmetry vanish , with corrections of @xmath596 . hence the on- and off - shell contributions cancel each other and we can use the usual ` recipe ' of replacing the @xmath9-violating contributions of the off - shell ( s)neutrino decays by the negative of the respective on - shell contributions , i.e.@xmath607 where @xmath457 is a flavour index .",
    "note that looking at this line of argument closely , this argument holds separately for neutrinos and sneutrinos because of distinct sets of initial and final states , but the summation over flavour and lepton / slepton is unavoidable .",
    "apart from the definition of the reheating temperature employed in this work , cf .",
    ", there are alternative ways to define the reheating temperature . for instance",
    ", we could use the temperature at the beginning ( @xmath305 ) or the end of reheating ( @xmath306 ) or the temperature when half of the total available energy has been transferred to radiation ( @xmath309 for the parameter example discussed in section  [ sec : example ] ) . in either case , although the respective value for @xmath265 may significantly vary , thanks to the temperature plateau during reheating the resulting reheating temperature would not change much . for the parameter point investigated in section  [ sec",
    ": example ] , we find @xmath608 our definition of the reheating temperature may hence be regarded as a compromise between several more extreme approaches .",
    "but more important than that , it picks up on a physical feature that other definitions would miss . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tempasymm ] we observe that the temperature declines less during the first part of reheating , @xmath609 , than during the second part , @xmath610 .",
    "the stage of @xmath6 reheating evidently splits up into two phases , during the first of which the temperature is basically constant , whereas during the second one the temperature slightly decreases .",
    "the reason for this substructure in the temperature plateau is the following .",
    "as soon as the @xmath288 neutrinos decay more efficiently their comoving number density starts to grow slower than @xmath611 .",
    "this diminishes the production rate of radiation . according to eq .",
    ", a constant temperature can then no longer be maintained .",
    "the advantage of our definition for @xmath315 now is that we read it off the curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : tempasymm ] at exactly that value of the scale factor at which the transition between these two phases of @xmath6 reheating takes place .",
    "our definition thus yields a temperature that is both representative as it mediates between several more extreme values and especially singled out as it is associated with a prominent feature in the temperature curve .    for completeness , we should however mention that for other parameter choices this picture may change",
    ". if the higgs decay rate @xmath299 is , for instance , larger than the neutrino decay rate @xmath317 , which can for example be achieved by going to lower values of the @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 scale , the scaling behaviour of the @xmath288 number density changes when the neutrino production efficiency begins to cease and not when the decays of the neutrinos themselves set in .",
    "the slight kink in the temperature plateau is then located at @xmath309 which is in this case before the decay of the @xmath288 has become fully efficient .",
    "but the definition of the reheating temperature in eq .   remains reasonable nonetheless .",
    "after all , if @xmath612 , the bulk of the total energy is first almost entirely accumulated in @xmath288 neutrinos before it is passed on to radiation .",
    "the energy in radiation thus receives its major contribution just when these neutrinos decay with a sufficient efficiency .",
    "the characteristic temperature at the time when this happens is then again obtained from eq .  .",
    "further details on the reheating temperature in regions in parameter space in which @xmath612 can be found in ref .",

    "<S> if @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 is broken at the grand unification scale , the false vacuum phase yields hybrid inflation , ending in tachyonic preheating . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 breaking higgs field and thermal processes produce an abundance of heavy neutrinos whose decays generate entropy , baryon asymmetry and gravitino dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> we study the phase transition for the full supersymmetric abelian higgs model . </S>",
    "<S> for the subsequent reheating process we give a detailed time - resolved description of all particle abundances . </S>",
    "<S> the competition of cosmic expansion and entropy production leads to an intermediate period of constant ` reheating ' temperature , during which baryon asymmetry and dark matter are produced . </S>",
    "<S> consistency of hybrid inflation , leptogenesis and gravitino dark matter implies relations between neutrino parameters and superparticle masses . in particular , for a gluino mass of @xmath3 , we find a lower bound on the gravitino mass of @xmath4 .    </S>",
