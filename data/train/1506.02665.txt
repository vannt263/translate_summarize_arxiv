    "the ejecta from supernova ( sn ) explosions enrich the interstellar medium of the galaxy with heavy elements over thousands of cubic parsecs .",
    "identification of the ejecta products of sne is most easily done via analysis of the x - ray emission from young to middle - aged supernova remnants ( snrs ) , after the reverse shock has propagated back into the ejecta and heated it to x - ray emitting temperatures .",
    "one of the biggest open questions in sn research is what types of stellar progenitor systems lead to what types of sne and snrs . in only a handful of cases",
    "have astronomers directly observed the pre - sn star in archival images , and this situation is unlikely to change in the near future .",
    "the fundamental problem is that sne are plentiful but distant and point - like , while snrs are local and resolvable but limited in number .",
    "snr g284.3@xmath11.8 ( also known as msh 10 - 53 ; hereafter g284 ) has been identified through radio @xcite , optical @xcite , and x - ray @xcite observations , and is perhaps @xmath13  years old @xcite with a distance of 5.4@xmath14 kpc @xcite .",

    "we extracted spectra for j1018 from the two _ chandra _ observations .",
    "the spectra suffer from moderate pile - up ( 3,294 and 1,498 counts in the @xmath31 aperture correspond to 0.24 and 0.17 counts per frame in obsid 14657 and 16560 , respectively ) . to correct for pile - up",

    "we also investigate the spatial morphology of j1018 in the acis - i images and compare the surface brightness radial profile with a modeled psf and pile - up parameter @xmath32 . ]",
    "( figure  [ surfb ] ) .",
    "overall , the observed profile matches the simulated psf .",
    "there appears to be a mismatch between the simulated profile and the observed profile at @xmath48 , but this is likely due to an inacurate pile - up modeling in marx .",
    "in addition , the psf model is not very reliable at small distances due to the presence of the asymmetric psf anomaly around @xmath49 , which is not simulated by marx . including the pile - up correction in the marx 5.1 simulation does not change the profile substantially beyond @xmath50 , which is expected for moderate pileup .",
    "analyzing the high - resolution images of j1018 , we found an enhancement ( 24 photons in 0.58 kev within the ellipse shown in figure  1 , for the merged image ) located @xmath51 away from the best - fit centroid of the source at a position angle ( pa ) of @xmath52 ( counted east of north ) .",
    "the enhancement , visible in both observations , has @xmath53 significance estimated from comparison with the background ( which includes psf wings ) measured in the @xmath54 annulus for the merged image .",
    "the expected enhancement due to the known mirror artifact has a very similar pa , but is located significantly closer to the source center ( @xmath55 ) and is unlikely the cause of the enhancement . its appearance is similar to the fast - moving extended feature we recently discovered in the vicinity of b125963 @xmath0-ray binary ( pavlov et al .",
    "deeper followup _ chandra _ observations are needed to study this extended emission and its tentative connection to j1018 .",
    "although the optical counterpart of j1018 has been found and the binary nature of this system is firmly established , it remains unknown whether the compact object is a neutron star ( ns ) or a black hole ( bh ) .",
    "we use the known binary properties ( orbital period and mass of the donor star ) to place constraints on the compact object . while there is still some uncertainty about the exact range of masses of progenitors that end their lives as nss and those that become bhs",
    ", most models predict that , for solar or lower metallicities , the transition between nss and bhs occurs for stars with initial masses somewhere in the range of @xmath56  m@xmath57 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for metallicities much larger than solar , stellar evolution models predict that massive stars develop substantial winds , which cause enough mass loss that the end product is a ns rather than a bh @xcite . for our simulation we assume solar metallicity as the system is in the galactic disk . we first use the single star evolution ( sse ) code @xcite to study the evolution of stars with solar metallicity",
    "we find that stars with initial mass of  20 m@xmath57 and higher would end up as bhs , in agreement with the above .",
    "if j1018 started and evolved as a detached system ( no mass transfer ever happens ) , the progenitor star must have burned its hydrogen faster than the @xmath58 star and hence it should have been even more massive .",
    "therefore , in this scenario the compact object should be a bh .",
    "however , the lack of mass transfer would require a much larger than the currently observed ( @xmath59  d ) initial orbital period , which could only increase ( since the binary is assumed wide and there is no interaction to cause spiraling in ) after the progenitor explodes as supernova .",
    "thus we conclude that the system must have started as a tight binary and undergone mass transfer .    however , evolution of massive stars in tight binaries is more complicated because mass transfer can proceed from one star to the other , rendering the sse code inapplicable .",
    "therefore , we used binary stellar evolution ( bse ) models @xcite .",
    "we ran a grid of 80,000 simulations with the following parameters : @xmath60  m@xmath57 ( current donor star ) ,",
    "@xmath61  m@xmath57 ( sn / compact object progenitor with initial mass always greater than m1 ) , binary period @xmath62  d , eccentricity @xmath63 .",
    "we find 115 systems that end up with @xmath64  d , and @xmath65  m@xmath57 right after the sn explosion of star 2 .",
    "a large fraction of these simulated binaries are disrupted immediately after the sn , but we are not interested in such systems .",
    "our findings show that in order to reproduce the observed binary parameters we need the following initial conditions : @xmath66  m@xmath57 , @xmath67  m@xmath57 , @xmath68  d. the simulations resulted in a heavy ( @xmath69 ) ns as the compact object in 95% of the cases , while the o6v donor star gained mass ( from @xmath70  m@xmath57 to 31  m@xmath57 ) via mass transfer .",
    "note that the systems that match the above criteria have high eccentricity ( @xmath71 ) , while @xcite claim ( based on the tev observations ) that the eccentricity of j1018 should be closer to 0 .",
    "the northern region analyzed in @xcite roughly corresponds to our `` north '' region .",
    "we extend their analysis , supplementing it with additional _ chandra _ and deeper _ xmm - newton _ data ( their analysis used a 20 ks _ xmm _ observation ) , while expanding the analysis to our `` west '' region as well .",
    "while we do not show it here , we have also found that the northern filament , identifiable in radio , h@xmath72 , and x - rays , is present in the wise 22 @xmath73 m ir data .",
    "ir emission from the forward shock in snrs is common , even in more evolved snrs @xcite , and generally results from dust heated in the post - shock environment .",
    "we extracted spectra from the north region using only the mos 2 and _ chandra _ observations , since this region falls on one of the dead mos 1 chips .",
    "for the west region , data from mos 1 , mos 2 , and _",
    "chandra _ are used .",
    "after background subtraction , slight residuals remained in the mos 1 & 2 spectra from instrumental lines of al and si k@xmath72 at 1.49 and 1.75 kev , respectively .",
    "we excised small regions around both of these lines ( 1.45 - 1.53 kev and 1.71 - 1.79 kev ) from the mos 1 & 2 spectra , but kept those excised regions in the _ chandra _ spectra .",
    "for each region , we perform joint fits to all available data , with all parameters tied together .",
    "the column density , is taken from the fits to the x - ray spectrum of the point source , and is frozen in the fits to 8@xmath74 @xmath35 , the same value as @xcite used .",
    "we binned the data to a minimum of 50 counts per spectral bin for all snr datasets .",
    "we show the spectra from the north and west regions in figure  [ spectra ] .",
    "we fit these spectra with an absorbed plane shock model with variable abundances ( ` phabs*vpshock ` ) , assuming cosmic abundances from @xcite .",
    "the temperature and ionization timescale ( @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 ) were allowed to float freely , as were abundances of ne , mg , and fe .",
    "si was free as well , but was tied together with s due to the poor statistics of the s line .",
    "we kept o frozen at the solar value for two reasons : with the fairly high absorption towards the remnant , o lines are only barely visible , if present at all , and we wanted the abundances of the other elements to be normalized to some fiducial value ( the abundance of o ) .",
    "for the north region , we find normal cosmic abundances for ne and mg , with subsolar abundances for si ( @xmath79s ) and fe .",
    "subsolar abundances are often seen in the x - ray spectra of middle - aged snrs such as the cygnus loop @xcite .",
    "the relatively long ionization timescale and lower temperature leads us to concur with the analysis of @xcite that this emission is dominated by shocked ism .",
    "the ionization timescale is fit as @xmath80  @xmath81  s , but is unbound on the upper end ( lower - bound of 1.9 @xmath82 ) .",
    "an ionization timescale this long makes the spectrum almost indistinguishable from a plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium , again , not unexpected for the shocked ism from an older remnant .",
    "the spectra of the west region show an entirely different emission profile .",
    "they are relatively well - fit ( reduced @xmath83 of 1.4 for 184 d.o.f . ) by the same absorbed plane - shock model with variable abundances with the parameters shown in table  [ params ] . immediately obvious",
    "is the strong mg line at 1.35 kev .",
    "ne and fe are both consistent within errors with solar abundances , while si ( and s ) may be slightly overabundant .",
    "however , the overabundance of mg is about a factor of 4.5 higher with respect to o. this overabundance , combined with the higher temperature ( @xmath84 kev ) and much lower ionization timescale ( @xmath85 @xmath81 s ) implies that the emission in this region is dominated by mg - rich ejecta , heated by the reverse shock .",
    "this conclusion is not sensitive to the choice of model ; a regular nei model with variable abundances ( model ` vnei ` in xspec ) returns similar values .",
    "the spectral fits for this region are similar to those reported in @xcite for the lmc remnant n49b .",
    "their analysis is similar to ours , albeit with lmc abundances , different from those in the galaxy .",
    "they find an enrichment of mg and si ( though their si abundance is higher than ours ) , while ne and fe are not enhanced .",
    "they measure a mg / o ratio of 4.2 from a small portion in the interior of n49b , within errors of our measurement of 4.5 in g284 .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , the high mg / o ratio is surprising , as nucleosynthetic models predict that significant quantities of mg produced in core - collapse sne should be accompanied by significant quantities of o @xcite .",
    "while examples of significant o without mg are plentiful , it is unexpected to find significant mg without o.    as @xcite show , deriving a total mass of mg ejected by the sn from x - ray spectral analysis is very difficult , with estimates varying by more than an order of magnitude depending on the assumptions made .",
    "such an estimate is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "nonetheless , the high mg abundances in the ejecta suggest a substantial amount was synthesized in the explosion . in the nucleosynthesis models of @xcite",
    ", significant amounts of mg are only produced in massive progenitors of @xmath12 @xmath7 .",
    "while the northern region of g284 is dominated by shocked ism , we have shown that the ejecta - dominated western region is significantly overabundant in mg . along with n49b in the lmc , this makes only the second known remnant with mg - rich ejecta .",
    "models of nucleosynthesis in ccsn progenitors produce significant amounts of mg relative to other products , like si and fe , only in the explosions of massive stars ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "we find no statistically significant extended emission in the radial profile for @xmath87 from the binary j1018 at the center of g284 , though we do see a slight excess of photons a few arcseconds southeast of the source .",
    "the spectral parameters of j1018 are about the same in the two observations shifted by 0.25 in binary phase , but the flux difference is significant , @xmath88@xmath89 .",
    "our binary evolution calculations support the idea that the progenitor for this sn had an initial mass of @xmath90 25 @xmath7 .",
    "mass transfer prior to the explosion from the progenitor to the current donor star increased that star s mass to @xmath91 .",
    "our simulations imply that the compact object in the binary is a heavy , @xmath92 , ns .    with its large size and low surface brightness , g284 would benefit from a deep study with an x - ray telescope with both large effective area and field of view . a long observation with the pn instrument on _ xmm - newton _ in full frame mode or the soft x - ray imager ( sxi ) on the upcoming _ astro - h",
