    "for the determination of @xmath1 through the exclusive decay @xmath4 , the theoretical calculation of the form factor @xmath5 , especially in the zero recoil limit , is necessary .",
    "previously this has been done using the zero - recoil sum rule @xcite or the heavy quark expansion of the form factor @xcite . both of these calculations , however , need to introduce an assumption or a theoretical model to deal with hadronic effects away from the infinite quark mass limit . in this talk",
    ", we present a lattice calculation of the form factor @xmath6 , which can be used for a model independent determination of @xmath1 , including deviations from the heavy quark limit .",
    "the differential decay rate of @xmath0 is proportional to the square of @xmath8 @xmath9 and @xmath10 are form factors defined through @xmath11,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in the heavy quark mass limit ,",
    "@xmath15 vanishes , and @xmath16 agrees with the universal form factor @xmath17 ( the isgur - wise function ) , which is normalized in the zero recoil limit @xmath18 @xcite .    the @xmath19 expansion may be used to describe the deviation from the heavy quark limit . at zero recoil ,",
    "the expansion becomes @xmath20 the absence of the @xmath21 term in the expansion of @xmath2 , which is a part of the luke s theorem @xcite , is a consequence of the symmetry under the exchange of @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( see eq.([eq : definition_of_the_form_factors ] ) ) , and this particular form of the expansion is also restricted by the symmetry ( anti - symmetry for @xmath3 ) .",
    "our task is to determine the coefficients @xmath24 and @xmath25 , for which there has been no model independent calculation .",
    "the vector current @xmath26 appearing in eq.([eq : definition_of_the_form_factors ] ) must be related to the lattice counterpart @xmath27 using the perturbative relation @xmath28 .",
    "this is true even for the equal mass ( @xmath29 ) case , because the lattice ( local ) vector current is not conserved . without a two - loop calculation ,",
    "this perturbative matching could in principle be a source of large systematic uncertainty of @xmath30 , which is too large to obtain the precision we seek for the form factor ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the statistical error in the lattice calculation would also be a problem , if we employed the usual method to extract the matrix element from three - point correlator .    to reduce these errors , we define a ratio at zero recoil @xmath32^{cont }    \\nonumber \\\\    & \\!\\",

    "the one - loop calculation is discussed in a separate talk @xcite .    to calculate the hadronic amplitude ,",
    "we define @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a three - point correlator , whose initial and final states are fixed at @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively and the vector current is moved to find a plateau .",
    "our calculation is done on a 12@xmath4024 lattice at @xmath41 .",
    "the fermilab action @xcite is used for heavy quark with @xmath42 .",
    "figure [ fig : r^b->d ] shows a nice plateau for the ratio @xmath43 . even with only 200 configurations the statistical error is remarkably small ( @xmath44 ) , because of the cancellation of statistical fluctuations in the ratio .",
    "fitting the plot with a constant we obtain @xmath45 for each combination of initial and final heavy quark masses . to fix the parameter in the @xmath19 expansion , we choose six values of the heavy quark mass covering the physical @xmath23 and @xmath22 , and fit the results with the form @xmath46 where the @xmath47 term is required to explain the data .",
    "figure [ fig : h+_heavy_mass_coeff ] shows the quantity @xmath48 , from which we extract the coefficients @xmath24 and @xmath49 .",

    "@xcite derived a bound @xmath54 using the zero - recoil sum rule . and @xmath55 .",
    "] our result is consistent with this bound within errors .",

    "we introduce a finite ( but small ) @xmath56 meson momentum @xmath57 and define a ratio @xmath58,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we use the definition of the form factors and expand in small @xmath59 .",
    "it is more convenient to define a double ratio @xmath60.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the property of elastic scattering @xmath61 is used for the denominator .",
    "figure [ fig : r_bdoverdd ] shows the corresponding ratio @xmath62 on the lattice for two different values of the @xmath56 meson momentum . as in the calculation of @xmath2 , the plateau is very clear and we can extract @xmath63 from this plot . the small correction proportional to @xmath59 may be eliminated by extrapolating to the @xmath64 limit .",
    "we also observe an antisymmetric property @xmath65 .",
    "the heavy quark mass dependence can be obtained with a similar strategy .",
    "we fit our data with @xmath66 and obtain @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which correspond to @xmath69 and @xmath70 in physical units .",
    "the results with physical mass parameter are @xmath71 where @xmath2 includes the one - loop correction + 0.025(6 ) @xcite .",
    "errors arise from statistics , mass parameter determination , and our estimate for higher order perturbative correction in the order given . using ( [ eq : decay_rate ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath72",
    "using a ratio in which a large cancellation of statistical and systematic errors takes place , we have calculated the @xmath0 form factors very precisely , which may lead to a better determination of @xmath1 . in the error bar given above , however , we have not yet included the discretization error and the effect of quenching .",
    "it is our hope that the bulk of these errors also cancels in the ratio .",
    "we leave these important issues for future study .",
