    "in the early seventies , @xcite proposed the _ endochronic theory of visco - plasticity _ , which postulates the existence of an _ intrinsic time _ governing the rate - independent evolution of stress and strains in materials , whereas the newtonian time is exploited to model the viscous behavior ; see also @xcite . in the case of plasticity without viscous effects , the resulting constitutive laws are characterized by the absence of an elastic domain and the corresponding hysteresis loops are typically smooth and open .",
    "the flow rules of these models were not originally formulated in terms of pseudo - potentials , which made the direct comparison of this class of models with classical plasticity theories difficult @xcite . however , it was recently proven by @xcite that endochronic models do admit a representation based on pseudo - potentials and on the normality assumption , provided that pseudo - potentials be endowed with an additional dependence on state variables .",
    "this proof , given for the case of plastically incompressible models , showed the strong relationship between the endochronic theory and the generalized plasticity @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that the non - linear kinematic hardening model , that is associated , but is not in a generalized sense , admits a representation in terms of a pseudo - potential .",
    "recently , the same authors extended this analysis to other models , like the mrz model @xcite and the non - associated drucker - prager model @xcite ; see also @xcite , @xcite . in summary , this thermodynamically well - posed approach can be used for a very large class of existing _ classical _ or _ non - classical _ plasticity models .",
    "actually , a similar approach is used in geotechnical engineering , see e.g. @xcite , where pseudo - potentials have an additional dependence on the so - called _ true stresses _ , distinguished from the _ generalized stresses_.",
    "the standard endochronic theory was modified by several authors through the introduction of a damage variable . using the strain equivalence postulate , @xcite proposed an endochronic model with isotropic damage , while @xcite discussed an endochronic model with anisotropic damage , in the larger theoretical framework of fracture mechanics .",
    "later , a different approach based on the postulate of energy equivalence was used , among others , by @xcite and @xcite .    in the aforementioned works ,",
    "the thermodynamic formulation of flow rules is not based on the notions of pseudo - potentials and loading surfaces , as it is typical for other classical plasticity models with or without damage .",
    "hence , in this paper , a simple endochronic model of plasticity with isotropic damage similar to that discussed by @xcite is presented : no generalization is introduced with respect to the previously cited models , but a new approach is suggested for their description . in detail , the postulate of strain equivalence is adopted ; the helmholtz energy is assumed to have a regular quadratic term and an additional singular term ; the tools of the convex analysis such as indicator functions and sub - differentials @xcite are used to define the flow rules starting from well - suited pseudo - potentials .",
    "this presentation leads to the proper definition of the plasticity loading surface for an endochronic model with damage and is a direct extension of the results concerning the endochronic model without damage already discussed in @xcite .",
    "only plastically incompressible models are considered here , since they permit to explain the main ideas , without introducing a too complex formalism .",
    "the extension to the general case is possible , but it is omitted for simplicity .",
    "the proposed analysis has an intrinsic interest , since it allows an easier comparison between endochronic models with damage and classical plasticity models with damage .",
    "nonetheless , in the authors opinion , another important reason justifies the interest towards this class of models : they represent the suitable theoretical basis for the analysis of the thermodynamic admissibility of the bouc - wen models with strength and stiffness degradation ; see among others @xcite .",
    "this was one of the main motivation at the origin of the present study and the related developments about degrading bouc - wen models are presented in a companion paper @xcite .",
    "after the introduction , the endochronic theory is presented in the second section : in the first part , standard endochronic models are described , while the second part concerns the definition of the flow rules of the extended endochronic theory , characterized by an additional scalar variable endowed with damage .",
    "the thermodynamic framework , with the definition of the suited pseudo - potentials , is discussed in the following section and is supplemented by numerical examples .",
    "then , a brief discussion about stability and uniqueness is made and the concluding remarks are given , where the topics dealt with in the companion paper @xcite are pointed out .",
    "the endochronic theory was first formulated by @xcite , who suggested the use of a positive scalar variable @xmath0 , called the _ intrinsic time scale _ , in the definition of constitutive plasticity models .",
    "the evolution laws are described by convolution integrals involving past values of the strain @xmath1 and suitable scalar functions @xmath2 depending on @xmath0 , called _",
    "memory kernels_. when the memory kernel is exponential , the integral expressions can be rewritten as simple differential equations , the flow rules ; in the case of an isotropic endochronic model without hardening or softening , called here nd - ec model ( see figure [ scheme_endo ] ) , fulfilling the plastic incompressibility assumption , they read : @xmath3 where @xmath4 ( notice that @xmath5 different from zero is needed to have a non elastic behavior ) ; the superposed dot indicates the time derivative ; @xmath6 is the small strain tensor ; @xmath7 is the cauchy stress tensor ; @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the trace and deviatoric operators ; @xmath10 is the bulk modulus while @xmath11 is the shear modulus .",
    "the simplest choice for the _ intrinsic time scale _ flow indicated in ( [ endoformulgen ] ) is @xmath12 .",
    "it is interesting to note that relationships ( [ endoformulgen ] ) are equivalent to @xmath13where the trace of the plastic strain flow @xmath14 is zero , consistently with the assumption of plastic incompressibility .",
    "@xmath15 is the elasticity fourth - order tensor for isotropic materials ; @xmath16 is the second - order identity tensor ; @xmath17 is the fourth - order identity tensor and @xmath18 represents the tensor product .",
    "an endochronic model with isotropic hardening or softening with plastically incompressible flow is defined as follows : @xmath19where @xmath20 is called the _ hardening - softening function _ @xcite .",
    "as stated by its name , the function @xmath21 introduces isotropic hardening ( or softening ) , which distinguishes this model ( d - ec ) from the basic ones presented in the previous section and indicated as nd - ec ( see figure [ scheme_endo ] ) . in the classical endochronic formulations , @xmath22 is a function of @xmath23 , where @xmath23 is the _ intrinsic time measure_. a standard choice is @xmath24 according to @xcite .",
    "another more general definition , leading to a cyclic behavior similar to that of the prandtl - reuss model @xcite when the positive parameter @xmath25 is large enough , reads @xmath26 with @xmath27 $ ] in order to ensure the non - negativity of @xmath28 ; @xmath29 is the signum function .",
    "an important difference between ( [ zetan ] ) and the standard definition @xmath30 is related to the product @xmath31 , entailing @xmath32 when the deviatoric strain increment is orthogonal to the stress .",
    "however , @xmath28 can be different from zero during unloading , i.e. when @xmath33 .",
    "( [ zetan ] ) shows that @xmath34 affects the difference between the loading and unloading values of the intrinsic time increment at a given stress @xmath35 . in particular , when @xmath36 these increments are zero during unloading , while @xmath34 close to ( and greater than ) @xmath37 leads to relatively small increments during loading , while @xmath28 is relatively large during unloading .",
    "the influence of @xmath25 on the endochronic model behavior is discussed in the last section , with reference to the strain accumulation and the stress relaxation effects . according to ( [ endoformul1 ] ) and ( [ zetan ] ) and assuming @xmath38 , the norm of the tensor @xmath39",
    "is bounded as follows : @xmath40 for @xmath41 , provided that @xmath42 .",
    "this inequality proves that a limit strength value exists and only concerns the deviatoric part of the stress @xmath7 , consistently with the plastic incompressibility requirement .",
    "( [ sigmau ] ) also shows that this bounding stress depends on the parameters @xmath43 @xmath44 and @xmath25 .",
    "the expression ( [ endoformul1 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath45 from the last relationship in ( [ endoformulgen1 ] ) , it appears that the parameters @xmath46  and @xmath25 introduced in ( [ zetan ] ) affect the amplitude of the plastic strain flow , while the direction is always that of @xmath47",
    ".    a larger class of endochronic models can be defined by the following relationships @xmath48where @xmath49 is a scalar variable introducing isotropic damage . the plasticity model with damage defined by ( [ endogen1 ] )",
    "is named here the _ extended endochronic model _ and it belongs to the class of dd - ec models , as indicated in figure [ scheme_endo ] .",
    "note that the stress is defined by introducing the factor @xmath50 , consistently with the definition of _ effective stress _ and the _ principle of strain equivalence _ @xcite .",
    "moreover , it can be observed that the relationships ( [ endogen1 ] ) are equivalent to @xmath51which can be compared with ( [ endoformul1 ] ) .    a possible choice for @xmath28 is given by @xmath52 which represents a direct generalization of ( [ zetan ] ) : the last factor depending on @xmath49 and @xmath25 is introduced in order to have an intrinsic time depending on the effective stress instead of the actual one , consistently with the strain equivalence postulate .",
    "an elastic with damage model can be defined by assuming @xmath32 . in the authors knowledge ,",
    "the notions of pseudo - potential and loading surface were never applied to the extended endochronic theory ; therefore , these aspects are analyzed in detail in the next section .",
    "the aim of this section is to define the helmholtz free energy and the pseudo - potential leading to the flow rules ( [ endogen1 ] ) or , equivalently , ( [ sigdam ] ) . under the assumption of isothermal and small transformations ,",
    "the helmholtz free energy density is chosen as follows : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the vector of state variables ; @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath49 were previously defined ; @xmath57 is a scalar internal variable associated with isotropic hardening . for all the state variables , an initial zero value is assumed .",
    "the choice of @xmath23 to indicate an internal variable might seem misleading , since the symbol @xmath23 was also used in ( [ endoformul1])-([sigdam ] ) to define the _ intrinsic time measure_. however , as it will be seen hereafter , this choice is the proper one , as for endochronic models , @xmath23 has simultaneously both meanings ; @xmath58 is the regular part of the helmholtz energy ; @xmath59 is the indicator function of the closed set @xmath60 : by definition , an indicator function is equal to @xmath61 inside @xmath60 and equal to @xmath62 outside @xcite ; the set @xmath60 indicates the admissibility domain for the state variables @xmath63 and should be introduced every time some conditions on state variables are to be imposed : for instance , it is equal to the interval @xmath64 $ ] in order to impose the admissible values for the damage variable @xcite .",
    "once @xmath65 is known , the _ non - dissipative _ thermodynamic forces @xmath66 are defined as the gradient of @xmath67 : @xmath68 while the _ non - dissipative reaction forces _ @xmath69 are given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the _ sub - differential _",
    "operator @xcite .",
    "if the constraints imposed by @xmath60 are fulfilled , the indicator function @xmath59 is zero and @xmath72 .",
    "this entails the identity of the time - derivatives , viz .",
    "@xmath73 . in other words , one has @xmath74 for every instant @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "due to the assumptions of isothermal and small transformations , the expression of the second principle reads : @xmath76([2ndprinc ] ) states that the _ intrinsic _ ( or _ mechanical _ ) _ dissipation _ @xmath77 has to be non - negative . introducing the _ dissipative _ thermodynamic forces @xmath78 as @xmath79 and substituting ( [ statethermoforce ] ) in ( [ 2ndprinc ] ) ,",
    "one obtains : @xmath80    in order to fulfill ( [ 2ndprinc1 ] ) , the flows of the state variables @xmath81 and @xmath82 have to be suitably correlated with the _ dissipative _ thermodynamic forces @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , some additional _ complementarity rules _ need to be defined : usually , a scalar non - negative function called _ pseudo - potential _",
    "@xmath85is introduced and the dissipative forces @xmath86 are derived imposing the so - called _ generalized normality assumption _ on it .",
    "equivalently , one can define the flow rules @xmath87 by imposing the generalized normality assumption on the _ dual _ pseudo - potential @xmath88 , which is the legendre - fenchel transform of @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "this last method will be explicitly exploited herein .",
    "the generic flow @xmath90 is noted with `` prime '' , while the actual flow at the present state is noted with @xmath87 . as a matter of fact",
    ", the pseudo - potential is assumed to vary with the present value of state variables @xmath63 and with some additional parameters collected in the vector @xmath91 .",
    "these parameters may be any quantity related to the past history of the material @xcite .",
    "for instance , one may have @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the dissipated energy per unit volume at the point @xmath94 of the body volume and @xmath95 is the maximum ( from @xmath96 to the present state @xmath97 ) of the strain norm at the same point .",
    "observe that the parameters collected in @xmath98 could also be _ non - local _ , like @xmath99 , i.e. the energy dissipated in a given volume @xmath100 around the point @xmath94  of body volume .",
    "when no viscous effect occurs , the case of plasticity with damage is recovered .",
    "this corresponds to choose a pseudo - potential @xmath89 independent from @xmath101 , entailing @xmath102 ; for a detailed derivation of these relationships , see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "moreover , `` plastic flow may occur without damage and damage may occur without appreciable macroscopic plastic flow '' @xcite .",
    "therefore , ( [ 2ndprinc1 ] ) with @xmath103 `` must be split in two independent inequalities '' : @xmath104 the two scalar quantities @xmath105 and @xmath106 respectively define the rate of energy per unit volume dissipated by plasticity - related phenomena and by damage phenomena ; see figure [ fig_dissen ] .",
    "their sum @xmath107 is the rate of the total dissipated energy per unit volume and coincides with the intrinsic dissipation @xmath108 .",
    "the restrictions imposed by these two inequalities are more severe than the original unique inequality of clausius - duhem ( [ 2ndprinc1 ] ) .",
    "however , they are usually adopted as basic thermodynamic criterion for the formulation of plasticity models with damage @xcite .",
    "this assumption will be adopted hereafter .",
    "taking into account ( [ doubleineq ] ) , the pseudo - potential is supposed to split into two pseudo - potentials @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively related to damage and plastic flow : @xmath111 in the following sections , the helmholtz free energy , the pseudo - potentials @xmath109 and @xmath112 , as well as their legendre - fenchel transforms @xcite , are formulated for the endochronic model with damage ( [ endogen1 ] ) .      according to ( [ pot0 ] ) , for the dd - ec models",
    "one has the following helmholtz free energy : @xmath113 in this paper , two cases are considered : @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are positive parameters ; @xmath117 collects all state variables except @xmath49 and @xmath118 is a non - negative function called _ source of damage_. the first two conditions on @xmath49 impose the minimum and the maximum values for this variable . as it will be seen , the third condition in ( [ h1 ] ) is strictly related to the definition of the damage limit surface .",
    "the second case is characterized by a different assumption : @xmath119 where only the two basic inequalities on @xmath49 are retained .    making use of ( [ statethermoforce ] ) , ( [ helm ] ) , ( [ h1 ] ) and of the pseudo - potential ( [ phi d ] ) , i.e. the definition 1 of @xmath120 given in the following section , it is possible to prove that the assumption @xmath121 is admissible .",
    "the same holds for the model defined by ( [ helm]),([h2 ] ) and ( [ pseudodammod ] ) ( definition 2 of @xmath122 ) . for brevity , the details of this proof ,",
    "are omitted . as a result ,",
    "the non - dissipative thermodynamic forces fulfill the following relationships : @xmath123 moreover using ( [ nondissthermforces ] ) and supposing @xmath124 , the energy dissipation rate reads @xmath125 taking the time - derivative of ( [ nondissthermforces])@xmath126 and recalling that no viscous effect is considered ( @xmath127 ) , one obtains @xmath128 where @xmath129 is an elastic strain flow at constant damage and @xmath130 is an elastic strain flow at constant stress .",
    "it follows that @xmath131 .",
    "note that in general the endochronic theory may present non - zero energy rates @xmath132 and @xmath106 also during unloading phases ; see figure fig_dissenb in this respect .",
    "the formalism of the loading function @xmath133 , as well as the pseudo - potential @xmath134 , can be used to express the damage evolution @xcite .",
    "we present herein a well - known damage evolution rule by using both pseudo - potentials @xmath135 and its dual @xmath136 .",
    "then , a discussion is done about a novel pseudo - potential leading to a damage evolution where @xmath82 may be different from 0 also during unloading phases . in detail , the main difference between the two cases is related to the role of the damage limit surface .",
    "standard damage evolution rules , viz .",
    "definition 1 , are characterized by the possibility for the actual state point to be inside the damage domain delimited by this limit surface ; in this situation and in particular during unloading phases , damage increments are null .",
    "conversely , in the damage evolution which we propose here , i.e. definition 2 , the present state point is forced to be always on the damage limit surface also during unloading phases .",
    "let us begin with the following pseudo - potential , associated with the helmholtz free energy ( [ helm])-([h1 ] ) : @xmath138 \\text { } \\dot{d}% ^{\\prime } + \\mathbb{i}_{\\mathbb{d}_{d}}\\left ( \\dot{d}^{\\prime } \\right ) \\label{phi d}\\ ] ] and @xmath139 the pseudo - potential @xmath120 is the sum of a _",
    "part , proportional to @xmath140 and of the indicator function @xmath141 .",
    "the term multiplying @xmath140 in the regular part of @xmath120 is always non - negative , by virtue of the third condition defining @xmath60 in ( [ h1 ] ) .",
    "the regular part of @xmath120 , considered for the actual flow @xmath142 , represents the rate of dissipated energy @xmath106 .",
    "( [ phi d])-([effectivedd ] ) allow a large number of standard damage evolution rules to be represented , according to the specific definition of @xmath143 .",
    "an interesting example is @xmath144^{+}\\right ) ^{2}\\right )   \\label{fredam}\\ ] ] where @xmath145 is the lam constant . for a scalar @xmath146 , @xmath147 ^{+}:=\\left\\langle x\\right\\rangle $ ] , where @xmath148 are the mccauley brackets .",
    "the positive part @xmath149 of the tensor @xmath150 is obtained after diagonalisation .",
    "other definitions for @xmath151 can be adopted ; see , among others , @xcite and @xcite .    in order to derive the damage flow ,",
    "it is convenient to consider the legendre - fenchel transform of @xmath135 , which reads : @xmath152 \\\\ = \\mathbb{i}_{\\mathbb{e}_{d}}\\left ( y^{d^{\\prime } } ; \\mathbf{v } ; \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\rho$}\\right ) \\end{array } \\label{phi d star}\\ ] ] where @xmath153 is the damage loading domain and the corresponding loading function is : @xmath154 by using the normality assumption , the relevant damage flow rule reads @xmath155 at the actual state , it holds @xmath156 , and therefore : @xmath157 which is the damage limit surface , but also is one of the conditions defining the set @xmath60 .",
    "it becomes evident that the positive constant @xmath116 is the initial damage threshold .",
    "the kuhn - tucker conditions state that @xmath158 implies no damage increment , while @xmath159 corresponds to a damage increment which can be computed by enforcing the consistency condition : @xmath160 leading to the explicit expression of the damage flow @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the heaviside function .",
    "the presence of the heaviside function in the damage flow definition indicates that damage increments are zero during unloading phases .",
    "note that ( [ damageflowgen ] ) entails that the limit condition @xmath163 is never reached .",
    "figure [ fig_damfremel11 ] illustrates some loading - unloading cycles of an elastic with damage model ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the uniaxial stress is considered , viz .",
    "all the components of the cauchy tensor are supposed to be null , except @xmath164 .",
    "the parameter values represent a hypothetical material for which the young modulus @xmath165 @xmath166 and the poisson ratio @xmath167 are close to those of concrete ; damage is defined by ( [ h1 ] ) and ( [ fredam ] ) , with @xmath168 and @xmath169 @xmath170 ; see also the numerical examples in @xcite .",
    "together with the stress - strain and damage evolution of this model , figure [ fig_damfremel11 ] depicts the evolution of @xmath171 , i.e. the actual value of @xmath172 , and of the quantity @xmath173 , defining the upper limit of @xmath174 according to ( [ fd ] ) . when these two curves are superposed , the damage increases .",
    "unfortunately , a definition of @xmath82 of the type ( [ damageflowgen ] ) , deriving from the pseudo - potential ( [ phi d ] ) and the condition ( [ h1 ] ) , is not able to represent the case of damage increasing during both loading and unloading phases , owing to the condition @xmath175 .",
    "we recall that the case of damage increasing during unloading may occur in bouc - wen models with stiffness degradation @xcite .",
    "a damage pseudo - potential , simpler than ( [ phi d ] ) , is more suited : @xmath176 \\text { } \\dot{d}^{\\prime } + \\mathbb{i}_{\\mathbb{d}_{d}}\\left ( \\dot{d}^{\\prime } \\right ) \\label{pseudodammod}\\]]with @xmath177 still provided by ( [ effectivedd ] ) and with the conditions on the damage state variable defined in ( [ h2 ] ) . as already observed , it is possible to prove that the assumption @xmath178 is admissible also for this definition 2 of the damage pseudo - potential .",
    "the dual pseudo - potential becomes @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the corresponding damage loading domain , with the damage loading function @xmath181 at the actual state , @xmath156 and therefore @xmath182 at every instant .",
    "therefore , the relationships ( [ dam1kuhntuck ] ) reduce to @xmath183 , with @xmath184 .",
    "moreover , @xmath185 can no longer be computed by the consistency condition , fulfilled as an identity at every instant .",
    "hence , it must be rather defined by an additional condition . any definition ensuring rate - independence , consistent with ( [ h2 ] ) and fulfilling @xmath186",
    "is admissible , even though is characterized by non - zero damage increments during unloading phases .      the usual method to define associated plastic flows",
    "is based on the notion of _ loading function _",
    ", indicated here by @xmath187 , as well as on the normality assumption . another equivalent formalism is based on the use of the dual pseudo - potential @xmath188 @xcite . a third way to formulate plasticity models",
    "is based on the pseudo - potential @xmath110 , legendre - fenchel conjugate of @xmath189 @xcite .",
    "the advantage of using the formalism based on @xmath187 ( or @xmath190 ) is essentially simplicity .",
    "moreover , when a non - associated flow is to be defined , the simple introduction of a second function @xmath191 called plastic potential matches this purpose . nonetheless , for some non - classical plasticity theories , like endochronic theory and generalized plasticity @xcite , it is not straightforward to provide a proper definition of the loading function @xmath187 .",
    "it was proved by @xcite that for these plasticity theories ( without damage ) a way to define the loading function is to start from the definition of the pseudo - potential @xmath112 , to compute the dual potential @xmath192 and then to derive @xmath187 .",
    "an important point is the additional dependence of @xmath193 , and therefore of @xmath194 and the loading function too , on the _ state variables_. this dependence is only optional for standard plasticity theories but is essential both for the endochronic theory and the generalized plasticity .",
    "moreover , we notice that some models with non - associated flow also admit a representation based on the definition of a suited pseudo - potential @xmath110 , depending on state variables .",
    "the example of a non - associated drucker - prager model can be found in @xcite ; in particular , it is shown that a suited pseudo - potential @xmath110 leads to a _ modified _ loading function which plays both roles of the traditional loading function and of the plastic potential .",
    "for the endochronic models with damage , the plasticity pseudo - potential is defined as follows : @xmath195where @xmath196 is the indicator function of the convex set @xmath197(see figure [ fig_domains]a ) .",
    "the first equality in @xmath198 imposes the plastic incompressibility of the flow .",
    "moreover , since @xmath49 is supposed to be less or equal to one and @xmath199 , the hardening - softening function , is positive by assumption , the second condition in @xmath198 ensures the positivity of @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , the standard properties of @xmath110 , viz .",
    "non - negativity , convexity and positive homogeneity of order 1 , are matched .",
    "the third condition in @xmath198 gives the plastic flow and is consistent with ( endogen1 ) .",
    "it can be proven that when @xmath200 and @xmath201 , i.e. when the actual flows are considered , the first term of the sum in ( [ phi p ] ) represents the rate of energy @xmath105 dissipated by the plastic flow , defined in ( [ doubleineq ] ) for the general case .",
    "note that the pseudo - potential has an additional dependence on the state variables _ and _ on the past - history dependent parameters collected in @xmath98 .",
    "the dual dissipation potential @xmath202 is obtained by the legendre - fenchel transformation of @xmath110 @xcite . since @xmath203 is positively homogeneous of order 1",
    ", then @xmath202 is an indicator function : @xmath204the indicator function @xmath205 is associated with the convex set @xmath206 ( see figure [ fig_domains]b ) with @xmath207the function @xmath187 is the _ loading function _ for an endochronic model with plastic incompressibility and with isotropic damage .",
    "it is associated with the loading domain @xmath208 .",
    "if the past - history parameter @xmath98 is a scalar equal to @xmath209 , the plastic dissipated energy , then a _ work - hardening _ behavior is defined , in the sense that the loading function evolves with the plastic dissipated energy . a different approach to define work - hardening plasticity models",
    "was proposed by @xcite .",
    "the generalized normality conditions imposed on @xmath210 leads to : @xmath211 where the last three inequalities are the kuhn - tucker conditions .",
    "the plastic flow defined in ( [ endogen1 ] ) is retrieved .",
    "note that the derivatives are taken with respect to the generic variables @xmath212 and @xmath213 , but they are computed at the present state @xmath214 and @xmath215 . in summary , the usual notions of plastic multiplier and loading surface have been defined for an endochronic model with damage .",
    "this kind of thermodynamic formulation for endochronic models is quite innovative and has been first presented in @xcite , for the case of no damage . as was pointed out in that paper , an important property characterizing endochronic models is the fact that at the actual state , the loading function @xmath187 is always zero : for this reason , the consistency condition @xmath216 is always fulfilled as an identity and can not be used to compute the plastic multiplier @xmath217 .",
    "this is also true in this case , where the actual state is @xmath218 as a result , the kuhn - tucker conditions reduce to @xmath219 , where @xmath220 is the flow of the internal variable associated with @xmath221 and , using the language of the endochronic theory , is also the flow of the intrinsic time measure ; it can be freely defined , provided that it is non - negative and that rate - independence is guaranteed . as already observed ,",
    "the standard choice is @xmath222 .",
    "figure [ fig_damfremel - pl11 ] illustrates an example of uniaxial behavior of an endochronic plasticity model with damage .",
    "the parameters of the elastic phase and of damage ( definition 1 ) are the same as those of figure [ fig_damfremel11 ] .",

    "it is well - known that standard endochronic models violate the drucker s postulate and the ilyushin s postulate , see e.g. @xcite . as a result , inelastic strains may continuously increase if a cyclic stress of constant and arbitrarily small amplitude is imposed around a given static stress ( figure [ fig_drucker]a ) .",

    "the strain accumulation entails a violation of a lyapunov - type stability condition . for this reason ,",
    "endochronic theory have been repeatedly criticized in the past years .",
    "however , @xcite showed that endochronic models do fulfil some weaker physically motivated stability conditions",
    ". moreover , there are materials that are stable in the drucker s sense and others that are not . hence , for these materials , a proper model can not fulfil the postulate of drucker .",
    "all the aspects concerning this subject have been explored in detail in the previously cited references @xcite for endochronic models without damage . a detailed analysis for the case of models with damage would deserve further studies , but this is beyond the purposes of this paper .",
    "figures fig_druckera and [ fig_ilyushin]a simply show the influence of the parameter @xmath25 on the strain accumulation and the stress relaxation for an endochronic model without damage .",
    "when @xmath25 tends to infinity , a plastic behavior of prandtl - reuss type is retrieved , where neither strain accumulation nor stress relaxation occur .",
    "figures [ fig_drucker]b and fig_ilyushinb concern models with damage .",
    "another important topic concerning plasticity and/or damage models is the loss of uniqueness due to strain - softening ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "an exhaustive treatment of this subject for endochronic models with damage requires further analyses .",
    "however , for illustrative purposes , a simple analytical study of a uniaxial model is presented hereafter .",
    "let @xmath245 , @xmath246 and @xmath247 be the stress , the total strain and the plastic strain in the axial direction , respectively .",
    "then , the uniaxial behavior can be represented by the following law : @xmath248 , where @xmath249 is the young modulus .",
    "the incremental form reads @xmath250where the intrinsic time increment is @xmath251and the damage increment writes @xmath252with @xmath253 and @xmath254 .",
    "assume @xmath255 and @xmath256 ( loading ) ; the case @xmath257 , @xmath258 is analogous .",
    "then , the condition to avoid strain - softening is @xmath259the generic damage increment when @xmath260 is given by @xmath261moreover , from ( [ dsig0 ] ) one has @xmath262 .$ ] hence , the condition ( [ dsig>0 ] ) assumes the following form@xmath263the first factor is always positive provided that @xmath264 .",
    "this can be proven using the definition of @xmath265 given in ( [ dzeta ] ) with @xmath266 and observing that the non - negativity of the first factor in ( [ productsoft ] ) is equivalent to the condition @xmath267 , stating that the effective stress is always less or equal than the bounding axial stress @xmath268 , modified by the hardening function @xmath21 . if @xmath264 , this inequality is always strictly fulfilled .",
    "hence , strain - softening can be avoided if @xmath269 .",
    "the same result can be obtained using the tensor expressions ( endogen1 ) , ( [ zetandam ] ) , ( [ fredam ] ) and ( [ damageflowgen ] ) and imposing that all the stress components are zero except @xmath270 .",
    "this proof is omitted for brevity .",
    "the same condition on @xmath115 has been found for the case of elasticity with damage @xcite . note that @xmath271 induces strain - softening also when there is no damage .",
    "the analysis of the unloading case is not necessary , since at a given stress - strain state with @xmath272 , the unloading stiffness is always greater than the loading one .",
    "a more complex analysis , not considered here , is needed for the multi - axial case , where the fourth - order tensor of tangential moduli for the endochronic model with damage should be computed .",
    "if strain - softening is avoided , the uniaxial behavior in what concerns the strain accumulation and the stress relaxation is analogous to that of standard endochronic models .",
    "an extended endochronic theory with a scalar damage variable was developed , based on the postulate of strain equivalence and by using pseudo - potentials depending on state variables and on parameters related to the past history of the material .",
    "the relevant loading surfaces , for damage and for plasticity , were defined .",
    "two different damage pseudo - potentials were discussed and a formalization of the conditions on state variables affecting the definition of damage was provided , by an additional indicator function in the helmholtz free energy . in a companion paper @xcite , a link between this extended endochronic theory and the bouc - wen type models with both strength and stiffness degradation is established .",
