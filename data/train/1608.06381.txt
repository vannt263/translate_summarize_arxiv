    "for super - high temperature structural materials , refractory transition - metal silicides are amply investigated so far , which can effectively improve the performance of such as gas turbine engine in power generation systems .",
    "particularly , mosi@xmath7 with c11@xmath1 structure has been highly focused on , since it exhibits high melting temperature , high oxidation resistance , and low - temperature plastic deformability.@xcite however , in order to apply mosi@xmath7 to industrial applications , modification is still required since it exhibits poor fracture toughness , and poor creep strength at high temperatures.@xcite in order to modify these drawbacks , extensive works have been performed to form duplex composite with mosi@xmath7.@xcite mo@xmath8si@xmath9 with d8@xmath2 structure can be a promising candidate since mosi@xmath7/mo@xmath8si@xmath9 composite exhibits high eutectic temperature with script lamellar microstructures : the recent study confirms that the eutectic mosi@xmath7/mo@xmath8si@xmath9 composite can significantly modify the creep strength of the mosi@xmath7 much effectively than other mosi@xmath7-based composits previously reported , while low - temperature fracture toughness should be still further modified.@xcite    for modification of the fracture toughness , introducing additional elements to effectively change the interface cohesion has been performed : they find that additional elements with low solubility in both mosi@xmath7 and mo@xmath4si@xmath5 , including ni and co , exhibit pronounced segregation to mosi@xmath3/mo@xmath4si@xmath5 interface , and also find that introducing these elements successfully refine the microscopic structure of script lamellar.@xcite although these results strongly indicate that interface segregation of additional elements can effectively control its microscopic structure , it has not been theoretically confirmed ( i ) energetically stable contact in atomic scale between mosi@xmath3 and mo@xmath4si@xmath5 without additional elements , or ( ii ) whether the segregated interfaces are thermodynamically stable . with these considerations , the present study address these two important points by using cluster expansion@xcite technique based on first - principles calculations .",
    "the previous experimental study confirm that the interface mainly composed of the so - called `` terrace '' and `` ledge '' part , where we here focus on the stable contact for terrace without additional elements , and then quantitatively estimate temperature dependence of segregation profile near interface for additional elements of ni and co.",
    "let us first describe how to find energetically most stable contact , where crystal structures of mosi@xmath3 with c11@xmath10 and mo@xmath4si@xmath5 with d8@xmath2 structure are shown in fig .  1 .     ( c11@xmath11 ) and mo@xmath4si@xmath5 ( d8@xmath2 ) with their lattice plane of ( 001 ) and ( 110 ) described by green planes , where dark and bright spheres respectively represents mo and si atom .",
    "]    the previous experimental study reveals that the terrace part of the interface corresponding to the contact between c11@xmath10 ( 001 ) and d8@xmath2 ( 110 ) plane , where c11@xmath10 [ 110 ] and [ 1@xmath120 ] are respectively parallel to d8@xmath2 [ 1@xmath120 ] and [ 001 ] direction . from fig .",
    "1 , it is clearly seen that there can be multiple number of possible symmetry - nonequivalent contacts . in the first - principles calculation",
    ", we therefore construct all possible symmetry - nonequivalent contacts in order to find energetically most stable interface without additional elements . since considered lattice misfit between @xmath13 for mosi@xmath3 with c11@xmath1 and @xmath14 for mo@xmath4si@xmath5 with d8@xmath2 is sufficiently small ( i.e. , @xmath15% ) , we here construct coherent interface structure where the lattice parameter is kept fixed at that for mosi@xmath3 with c11@xmath1 . the interface slab for first - principles calculation is composed of 18-layer c11@xmath1 ( 001 ) , 24-layer d8@xmath2 ( 110 ) plane and 19 @xmath16 vacuum region , which leads to 116 mo atoms and 120 si atoms in the slab .",
    "we consider the energetic stability for the interface slabs based on interface energy.@xmath17@xcite we performed the first - principles calculation using a dft code , the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp)@xcite based on the projector augmented wave method,@xcite to obtain total energy for the interface slabs .",
    "generalized gradient approximation perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( gga - pbe)@xcite was employed to treat the exchange - correlation functional . plane - wave cutoff energy of 400 ev was used throughout the calculations .",
    "geometry optimization was performed until the residual forces became less than 1 mev /  .",
    "brillouin - zone integration was performed on the basis of the monkhorst - pack scheme@xcite with a @xmath18 k - point mesh .",
    "we describe here our model to address interface segregation behavior of additional elements . for segregation , we employ energetically most stable interface obtained by the above procedure . in order to compare our first - principle calculation with previous experimental reports , we choose two additional elements of ni and co , which both exhibits strong interface segregation.@xcite then we define corresponding interface segregation energy for additional element @xmath0 ( @xmath0=ni or co ) as @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes dft energy of the interface slab where one mo atom in the middlemost layer in d8@xmath2 region is replaced by @xmath0 , and @xmath21 denotes dft energy where one mo atom in the other layer @xmath22 in d8@xmath2 or c11@xmath1 is replaced by @xmath0 .",
    "we employ the same calculation condition for first - principles as that for finding stable interface structure described above .",
    "we first show in fig .  2 interface energy @xmath17 for possible contact between c11@xmath11 ( 001 ) and d8@xmath2 ( 110 ) plane ( left - hand figure ) , and interface structure having lowest energy ( right - hand figure ) .",
    "we can clearly see that interface energy for possible contacts all have positive interface energy , and they are typically around 0.1 - 0.3 ev / @xmath6 .",
    "these values of interface energy is slightly higher than those for interface between c11@xmath1 and c40 of mosi@xmath3 confirmd by our previous dft study,@xcite which naturally comes from the deviation in geometric differences : for the latter case , main difference comes from their stacking sequence , while in the present system , this does not hold true .",
    "c11@xmath1 ( 001 ) and mo@xmath4si@xmath5 d8@xmath2 ( 110 ) plane .",
    "right : interface structure having lowest interface energy , where dark and bright spheres denotes mo and si atom , respectively . ]    from fig .  2 , we can qualitatively see that energetically stable interface structure appears to have coherent contact with each other , having interface energy of 0.08 ev / @xmath6 .",
    "next , using the most stable interface shown in fig .  2 , we estimated segregation energy for additive elements @xmath0 ( @xmath0=ni or co ) to address energetically favorable site for additional elements .",
    "figure  3 shows segregation energy for the three additive elements in terms of distance from interface .",
    "we can clearly see that segregation energy shows qualitatively similar tendencies : ( i ) they all exhibit minimum value at distance from interface of around 1  , indicating that ni and co are all expected to exhibit strong segregation to interface , and ( ii ) segregation energy for mosi@xmath3 region is around 1 ev higher than that for mo@xmath4si@xmath5 region : these ( i ) and ( ii ) both qualitatively agree with the previous experimental result@xcite where composition of ni or co for mo@xmath4si@xmath5 region is around 0.5 % higher than that for mosi@xmath3 region .",
    "therefore , the present approach based on segregation energy for additive elements defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : seg ] ) can reasonably capture the characteristics of the measured interface segregation .    to quantitatively determine the temperature - dependence of segregation profile at the interface , we combine cluster expansion ( ce ) technique with monte carlo ( mc ) statistical simulation to include statistical ensemble .",
    "we have demonstrated the predictive power of the present combination of ce and mc based on dft calculation in the segregation profile for alloy nanoparticles and surfaces.@xcite briefly , ce provides orthonormal expansion of internal energy in terms of atomic configurations , where their basis functions are described by a pseudospin variable , @xmath23 , taking + 1 ( -1 ) when @xmath24 site is occupied by mo ( ni or co ) atom . in the ce ,",
    "configurational energy is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 represents linear average over all lattice points , and coefficient , @xmath27 , is called effective cluster interaction ( eci ) for cluster @xmath28 consisting of lattice points .",
    "to apply the ce expansion , we employed the following relationship between segregation energy in eq .",
    "( [ eq : seg ] ) and eci:@xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes eci for point cluster at interface layer @xmath22 . using the above relationship , segregation profile for ni and co can be quantitatively estimated by applying the ecis to mc simulation under grand - canonical ensemble . in the mc simulation ,",
    "an interface slab of @xmath31 in - plane expansion of the interface with 28 layer is used in the calculation .",
    "we confirm that the size of the used mc simulation box is sufficient for ensemble average : we search chemical potential giving dilute ni or co composition of 0.5 % in d8@xmath2 bulk region , since the measured ni or co composition for this region is around this value.@xcite    under these conditions , we show in fig .  4 the resultant interface segregation profile for ni and co at @xmath32 k , in terms of distance from interface .",
    "we can clearly see the strong segregation at interface both for ni and co , which agrees with previous experimental result .",
    "k for ni and co in terms of distance from interface , predicted by monte carlo statistical simulation . ]    furthermore , ni composition at interface is much higher ( more than twice ) than co composition at interface .",
    "these results successfully capture the relative interface segregation for ni and co by previous measurement.@xcite meanwhile , we find quantitative difference in absolute magnitude of composition at interface : our simulation predicts ni and co composition at interface of 9.1 and 4.5 % , while previous experiment reports lower value of @xmath33 and @xmath34 % , respectively .",
    "we believe this deviation between our theoretical and previous experimental results mainly comes from the fact that while our simulation can predict composition for additive elements at individual atomic layer ( order of  ) , experimental composition is averaged over much wider region of order of nano meter : considering these facts , our thermodynamic simulation successfully predict interface segregation for ni and co , indicating that segregated interface between c11@xmath1 ( 001 ) and d8@xmath2 ( 110 ) plane is thermodynamically stable , which can be reasonablly attributed to differences in segregation energy shown in fig .  3 for energetically most stable interface .",
    "segregation behavior of additive elements of ni and cr for mosi@xmath3/mo@xmath4si@xmath5 interface is quantitatively investigated based on first - principles calculation .",
    "we focus on segregation profile for interface structure having lowest interface energy , where corresponding segregation energy is considered for monte carlo statistical simulation under grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "we find that strong interface segregation and its magnitude relationship for ni and cr can be reasonablly attributed to differences in segregation energy of individual atomic layer for most stable interface : these facts indicate that previously measured segregated interface can be thermodynamically stable .",
