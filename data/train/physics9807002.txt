    "we have also evaluated @xmath24 by means of the pot sums ( [ thetascl ] ) . as seen in the inset of fig .",
    "1 , the quantal values of @xmath24 agree very well with ones obtained from the semiclassical expression .",
    "semiclassics permits a simple interpretation of the sss .",
    "the shortest po s enclosing magnetic flux are the triangle and square .",

    "although they make the peaks higher the beat pattern is not much changed up to @xmath49 .",
    "the upper and lower envelops of the full calculation are not very different from the ones of the truncated calculation .",
    "this demonstrates that the beat pattern is basically generated by the triangle and the square .",
    "for @xmath50 , the full calculation has a beat minimum where the truncated one has a maximum , indicating that the interference with the longer orbits becomes important .",
    "the relation between the shell contributions to the zero field free energy , @xmath44 , and to the susceptibility , @xmath24 , is understood by comparing the two pot sums ( [ thetascl ] ) .",
    "the terms are identical up to the factor @xmath51 in @xmath24 , which suppresses the orbits @xmath52 and gives the long orbits a higher weight .",
    "if only few orbits with similar values of @xmath53 contribute , @xmath54 .",
    "the simple scaling is also expected to hold for shapes not too different from the sphere and can be used to relate the ss in the susceptibility and free energy .    in the 3d case",
    "the diameter orbit is suppressed by a factor @xmath55 as compared to the planar orbits , because it has a lower degeneracy .",
    "this makes its contribution to @xmath44 insignificant for large @xmath0 .",
    "the two sums @xmath44 and @xmath24 become similar , because the leading terms are the triangle and square .",
    "in fact , for @xmath56 we find @xmath54 with @xmath57 in ( [ scaling ] ) ( where @xmath58 is the fermi gas energy ) . for the lower temperature @xmath59 , shown in figs . 1 and 2 , we find a ratio @xmath60 with @xmath61 at the sss maxima ( @xmath62 and 17 ) .",
    "the sss minima are less pronounced for @xmath24 than for @xmath44 . there",
    "the triangle and square cancel each other .",
    "the main contribution comes from longer orbits , which are much more important for @xmath24 than for @xmath44 , preventing @xmath24 from becoming as small as @xmath44 .",
    "this interpretation is also supported by fig .",
    "the difference between the full and truncated calculations , which represents the contribution of the longer orbits , is just an up - shift of the upper envelop .",
    "-1 cm    the sss is clearly developed for the temperature of @xmath59 , shown in fig .",
    "1 . for @xmath63",
    "we find very pronounced ss with an amplitude of a few thousand lu , but little sss .",
    "the averaged susceptibility stays around 1500 lu with small peaks ( 400 lu high ) at @xmath64 and 13 . due to a weak temperature damping in the pot sum",
    "many orbits contribute to the sum , destroying the simple beat pattern .",
    "this is at variance with a distinct sss pattern in @xmath44 persisting to @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "the reason is the factor @xmath66 which suppresses the orbits with high @xmath31 .",
    "for @xmath67 there is sss , but the amplitude of the basic shell oscillations remains below 5 lu for @xmath68 , becoming small compared with the lu for larger @xmath0 .",
    "hence , the intermediate temperature seems to be optimal for the observation of the sss .",
    "experimentally , the average susceptibility of an ensemble of clusters with a distribution in @xmath0 will be measured .",
    "let us consider a gaussian distribution in @xmath69 of width @xmath70 , which corresponds to about one oscillation . as shown in fig.1 , _ averaging the susceptibility damps out only the basic shell oscillations , whereas the sss remains as a modulation of the strongly paramagnetic susceptibility .",
    "_ hence , it is expected that the sss can be observed with a moderate mass selection of the clusters that would not allow to resolve the basic ss ( @xmath71 for @xmath72 in fig .",
    "1 ) .    the qse of the susceptibility survives the averaging only for the canonical ensemble @xcite .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "1 compares the canonical with grand canonical ensemble ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "though the positions of the extrema are similar , the shape of peaks is rather different . for the grand canonical ensemble",
    "the negative and positive values are equally probable and , as the result , averaging with respect to @xmath0 quenches @xmath24 . for the canonical ensemble ,",
    "the positive values are more frequent and the qse survives the averaging with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "the preference of @xmath74 for the canonical ensemble is evident from pot sum ( [ thetascl ] ) : the shell correction to the level density @xmath75 , which is given by setting the factor @xmath76 , oscillates in phase with @xmath24 , i. e. more @xmath0 values correspond to a paramagnetic than to a diamagnetic susceptibility and the average with respect to the particle number is positive .",
    "let us discuss this correlation in more detail , because it is crucial for the measurability of the sss .",
    "3 illustrates that the typical inverted parabolas appear already for the lowest orbits .",
    "it is sufficient to consider only one term in ( [ thetascl ] ) , say the triangle . for the grand canonical ensemble , the wave number @xmath77 is constant ( @xmath78 is the fermi gas value ) .",
    "the orbit length is @xmath79 .",
    "the susceptibility is proportional to @xmath80 ( for simplicity the phase @xmath81 is left away ) , which averages to zero .",
    "the particle number expectation value as given by ( [ partnum ] ) contains a term proportional to @xmath82 that makes it oscillating around @xmath0 .",
    "thus , for the canonical ensemble , the wave number @xmath83 can not be constant .",
    "it must contain an oscillating term @xmath84 in order to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ partnum ] ) . in order to understand qualitatively its consequences for the susceptibility we use an argument from refs .",

    "( [ partnum ] ) gives @xmath86 .",
    "the susceptibility is proportional to .",
    "the second term is proportional to @xmath87 which averages to 1/2 .",
    "hence , the total averaged susceptibility is positive .",
    "since the interference between the triangular and quadratic orbits in both @xmath24 and @xmath75 is about the same , the sss modulates paramagnetic term also after averaging .",
    "the oscillations of @xmath84 narrow the minima and broaden the maxima of the susceptibility . in our calculations , @xmath85 is treated exactly . as seen in figs . 1 and 3 , due to the higher orders in @xmath85",
    "the minima are narrowed to cusps and the maxima take the shape of parabolas .",
    "real clusters deviate from the perfect spherical cavity : the surface has a finite thickness of the order of the screening length .",
    "the discrete ionic back ground implies a certain surface roughness of the order of the interatomic distance .",
    "there may be impurities or other imperfections distributed over the volume .",
    "the ss in a spherical potential with a realistic surface thickness ( the one of sodium ) has been studied in ref .",
    "the sss in the binding energies is clearly developed .",
    "the beat minima are somwhat shifted as compared to the cavity .",
    "the shift has been be traced back to small changes of the action of the pot due to the modified `` reflection '' by the finite potential at the surface . since the expressions ( [ thetascl ] ) hold also for the more realistic potentials if the appropriate action @xmath88 is inserted , a similar shift of the sss pattern can be infered for the susceptibility .",
    "the consequences of the surface roughness for the shell structure of the ground state energy have been studied in ref .",
    "the energy is given by the pot sum ( [ thetascl ] ) , where each term contains an additional damping factor @xmath89 .",
    "assuming that the rough surface is randomly displaced relative to the ideal one , the damping factor is @xmath90 where a gaussian displacement distribution with the width @xmath91 is used .",
    "it has a simple interpretation .",
    "the number of reflection on the surface is @xmath31 . for each reflection",
    "the rough surface scatters a certain fraction of the particles away from the pot .",
    "the arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite can be immediately taken over to the zero field susceptibility .",
    "the damping factor arises from the reflections on the irregular surface .",
    "a weak magnetic field does not change the reflections on the surface and the damping factor ( [ rough ] ) appears also in the susceptibility .",
    "hence , the long orbits ( large number of reflections @xmath31 ) are strongly suppressed by the surface roughness . in ref",
    ". @xcite it is shown that a roughness @xmath92 reduces the amplitude of the ss to about 1/2 of the one of the ideal cavity .",
    "the sss is found to be nearly the same as for the ideal cavity .",
    "for the susceptibility one expects that the surface roughness strongly reduces the contributions of the long orbits , such that the sss pattern of fig . 1 approaches the one of fig .",
    "3 with a reduced amplitude . in particular , for very low temperature the surface roughness is expected to enhance the sss , because it efficiently damps the long orbits .    impurities or other imperfections that are homogeneously distributed over the volume will also scatter the particles away from the pot .",
    "the situation is analogous to the propagation of a wave in an absorbing medium , which has been considered in ref .",
    "the scattering results in a damping factor of the form @xmath93 , where @xmath94 measures the amount of scattering per unit length and corresponds to the mean free path of the electrons due to the imperfections .",
    "this kind of damping is equivalent with an increase of the temperature , because the temperature damping factor in ( [ thetascl ] ) @xmath95 .",
    "the consequences of a temperature increase are discussed above .",
    "in ref . @xcite the susceptibility has been measured for three ensembles of clusters with the average size of @xmath96 , 2 and 1.5 and a large spread in size .",
    "a paramagnetic enhancement of 5 , 2 and 1.5 is found , respectively .",
    "the decrease of the enhancement with @xmath0 , which ref .",
    "@xcite mentions as an unexplained phenomenon , can be seen in fig . 1 .",
    "to identify the sss , experiments with more points in @xmath0 and a mass resolution better than 30% are needed .",
    "an alternative experiment would be the measurement of the deflection of a cold cluster beam in an inhomogeneous magnetic field , which provides directly the susceptibility . to reach the necessary sensitivity of such",
    "a stern - gerlach apparatus seems to be possible @xcite .",
    "it is favourable for this kind of experiment that only a moderate mass selection is needed to observe sss , what permits larger intensities .",
    "measuring the susceptibility could shed new light on the electronic structure of small metal clusters .",
    "solid icosahedral shapes have been suggested for sodium clusters with @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "our sphere model should be a rough first approximation for @xmath98 . in this range",
    "the shell energies @xmath99 for the spherical and icosahedral cavity are similar @xcite and , as discussed above , the same can be expected for the susceptibilities .",
    "a more pronounced paramagnetic sss is expected if shape of the cold clusters comes close to a rough sphere",
    ". the picture changes , if the clusters were liquid or would keep keep the same shape as in the liquid state when freezing at low @xmath11 .",
    "then magic clusters are spherical and strongly diamagnetic , whereas the non magical ones are deformed and weakly diamagnetic @xcite .",
    "thus , the averaged susceptibility would be diamagnetic , still showing a sss .",
    "4 shows the susceptibility for a half sphere with @xmath100 .",
    "the results are very similar to the full sphere .",
    "the main difference is a shift of the basic shell oscillations by half a period .",
    "the averaged susceptibility is almost indistinguishable from fig .",
    "cluster deposited on an insulating surface may take shapes close to half spheres @xcite",
    "the susceptibility of the 2d electron gas confined to a circular potential well with @xmath101 is shown in fig .",
    "5 . an effective mass of @xmath102 @xcite , appropriate for gaas , is assumed .",
    "the lu is @xmath103 .",
    "the 2d case is similar to the 3d - case , the main difference consisting in an increase of the qse with @xmath0 ( the values in fig .",
    "5 are divided by @xmath0 ) . at the temperature",
    "@xmath104 a distinct sss is seen .",
    "for @xmath105 the averaged susceptibility @xmath106 lu showing shallow oscillations with an amplitude of @xmath107 lu , which loosely correlate with the sss in fig .",
    "a sss beat pattern for a circular dot has been first calculated in @xcite .",
    "however , it is argued there and also in @xcite that when averaging over the ensemble of dots used as experimental probe , uncertainties in the shape and size will completely wipe out the shell structure , the only remaining qse being a paramagnetic enhancement that varies smoothly with @xmath0 . in contrast ,",
    "5 shows that averaging with a gaussian of width @xmath108 ( corresponding to a 10% spread in @xmath0 for @xmath72 ) destroys only the basic ss , whereas the sss remains visible .",
    "nowadays it is possible to manufacture probes with a large number of circular quantum dots , specifying the radius and the gate voltage with a 5% accuracy @xcite .",
    "changing the number of electrons in the dots by means of the gate voltage seems to be a possibility to measure the sss of the susceptibility .",
    "the imperfections in manufacturing circular dots will have similar effects as discussed above for the metal clusters .",
    "the discussion of the 3d case can directly be applied to the 2d case .",
    "thus , the sss pattern is expected to survive if the surface roughness @xmath109 .",
    "-1 cm    fig .",
    "6 demonstrates that , at variance with the 3d case , @xmath110 significantly differs from @xmath111 . for 2d case , the diameter orbit is not suppressed in @xmath44 .",
    "the interference of the diameter , triangle and square results in slower basic and faster beat oscillations as compared to @xmath24 , for which the diameter is missing . averaging with respect to @xmath112 filters out the slow oscillation due to the interference between triangle and square , which mainly modulates @xmath110 .",
    "the ss of the free energy should show up as a modulation of the capacitance of the dot .",
    "it is given by @xmath113 , which also determines the abundances of heavy clusters @xcite .",
    "the susceptibility of electrons confined in two or three dimensions by a spherical potential oscillates as function of their number .",
    "this shell structure is modulated by slow oscillations , the super shell structure , which only develops at sufficiently high temperatures .",
    "measurements that average out the shell structure may still reveal the super shell structure .",
    "the free energy of electrons confined in three dimensions , shows the analogous super shell pattern , which is observed in the abundances of metal clusters .",
    "however , for the two dimensional potential the shell structure of the free energy differs considerably from the one of the susceptibility .",
