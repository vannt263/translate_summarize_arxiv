    "@xmath5 , we can construct a stein filling as an allowable lefschetz fibration over @xmath6 with fiber @xmath7 , with vanishing cycles corresponding to @xmath5 .",
    "( we say that a lefschetz fibration is allowable if all vanishing cycles are homologically non - trivial in their fibers . )",
    "conversely , if @xmath8 is a stein manifold whose boundary is @xmath1 , then @xmath8 has a structure of an allowable lefschetz fibration @xcite .",
    "the boundary @xmath9 has an open book decomposition whose monodromy is a product of positive dehn twists around curves corresponding to the vanishing cycles ; this open book is compatible with the contact structure @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "thus , stein fillings of @xmath1 correspond to positive factorizations of monodromies of compatible open books .",
    "however , to detect non - fillability or to classify all stein fillings , one would have to consider _ all _ possible open books compatible with @xmath10 .",
    "the situation is much simpler for contact structures compatible with planar open books , thanks to the following recent result of chris wendl .",
    "[ wendl ] suppose that @xmath11 admits a planar open book decomposition .",
    "then every strong symplectic filling @xmath12 of @xmath11 is symplectic deformation equivalent to a blow - up of an allowable lefschetz fibration compatible with the given open book for @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , wendl s theorem implies that every stein filling of @xmath1 is diffeomorphic ( and even symplectic deformation equivalent ) to an allowable lefschetz fibration compatible with the given planar open book ; to classify fillings or to prove non - fillability , it suffices to study positive factorizations of the _ given _ monodromy .",
    "even so , enumerating positive factorizations for a given element of the mapping class is in general a very hard question .",
    "however , we are able to analyze certain simple monodromies by means of elementary calculations in the abelianization of the mapping class group of the planar surface . in this paper , we give two applications : first , we complete the classification of fillings for tight lens spaces @xmath0 , second , we study the fillability question for certain tight seifert fibered spaces .    every virtually overtwisted contact structure on @xmath0",
    "has a unique stein filling ( up to symplectic deformation ) , which is also its unique weak symplectic filling ( up to symplectic deformation and blow - up ) .",
    "[ main ]    for @xmath13 , every tight contact structure on @xmath0 has a unique stein filling ( up to symplectic deformation ) , which is also its unique weak symplectic filling ( up to symplectic deformation and blow - up ) .",
    "the above corollary combines theorem [ main ] together with earlier results , giving a complete description of fillings for tight @xmath0 .",
    "( note that fillings for @xmath14 are also understood due to @xcite and our theorem . )",
    "recall that eliashberg established uniqueness of a symplectic filling ( up to deformation and blow - up ) for the standard contact structure on @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "mcduff proved that standard contact structures on @xmath0 all have unique filling except for @xmath14 , which has two fillings , up to blow - up and diffeomorphism @xcite .",
    "hind showed that in mcduff s theorem , the stein filling of @xmath16 is in fact unique up to stein homotopy @xcite .",
    "lisca extended these results to obtain a classification ( again up to blow - up and diffeomorphism ) of symplectic fillings for arbitrary lens spaces @xmath17 equipped with standard contact structures @xcite .",
    "( by the standard contact structure on a lens space we mean the quotient of @xmath18 by the action of the cyclic group .",
    "all of the above results for the standard contact structure obviously extend to its conjugate , thus covering the two universally tight contact structures on @xmath17 . )",
    "theorem [ main ] extends classification of fillings in another direction , by a different technique .",

    "our second application concerns fillability of contact structures on seifert fibered spaces @xmath19 .",
    "( we use this notation for the space given by the surgery diagram of figure [ seifert ] ; here and throughout the paper , @xmath20 are rational numbers between 0 and 1 . )",
    "tight contact structures on such manifolds were studied by ghiggini  lisca  stipsicz @xcite and lisca  stipsicz @xcite ; when @xmath21 , a complete classification of tight contact structures on @xmath19 was obtained in @xcite ( in particular , each of these spaces is known to carry a tight contact structure ) .",
    "tightness of some of these contact structures was established by means of the heegaard floer theory ; it was shown in @xcite that one of the tight structures on @xmath22 is non - fillable .",
    "( recall that , in contrast , all tight contact structures on @xmath23 are fillable , see @xcite , cf @xcite ) .",

    "@xmath33 ) . then the space @xmath19 carries tight , symplectically non - fillable contact structures if @xmath34 ; otherwise all tight structures on @xmath19 are stein fillable .",
    "it is instructive to compare our method to other proofs of non - fillability .",
    "previous techniques ( see e.g. @xcite ) are all based on some version of gauge theory and the donaldson thorem , as follows",
    ". first one shows , using seiberg - witten or heegaard floer theory , that all symplectic fillings of a given contact structure must be negative - definite ; then the filling is completed to a closed negative - definite 4-manifold , so that by the donaldson theorem the intersection form of the filling embeds into a standard diagonalizable form over the integers .",
    "finally , existence of such an embedding must be ruled out ; often , this is possible because the first chern class of a stein filling can be understood in terms of the contact structure .",
    "we note that this method is in principle applicable to planar open books , because by @xcite every symplectic filling of a contact structure @xmath10 supported by a planar open book must be negative - definite , and have the intersection form that embeds into a standard diagonalizable form over the integers ; moreover , if @xmath35 , then @xmath36 of every stein filling of @xmath10 must be 0 .",
    "however , the analysis of possible embeddings of the intersection form can typically be done only in a very limited number of cases .",
    "our analysis of the monodromy factorizations , at least on the level of the abelianization , appears be a lot easier to do , and works in many situations .",
    "we are grateful to john etnyre for some helpful conversations , to dan margalit and chris wendl for helpful correspondence , and to paolo lisca and andrs stipsicz for their comments on a preliminary version of this paper .",
    "by honda s classification of tight contact structures on lens spaces @xcite , all tight contact structures on @xmath0 arise as surgeries on legendrian unknot with @xmath37 , i.e. the standard legendrian unknot stabilized @xmath38 times .",
    "more precisely , there are @xmath38 tight contact structures @xmath39 on @xmath0 , distinct up to isotopy ; the contact structure @xmath40 is the result of legendrian surgery on the stabilized unknot with @xmath41 cusps on the left and @xmath42 cusps on the right .",
    "legendrian surgery yields a stein filling for @xmath40 which is diffeomorphic to the union of @xmath43 and the 2-handle corresponding to the surgery .",
    "our job is to prove that every stein filling for a virtually overtwisted contact structure on @xmath44 is diffeomorphic to the one described above , and that the stein structure is unique , at least up to symplectic deformation . in our notation ,",
    "the virtually overtwisted contact structures are @xmath45 ; indeed , by @xcite , the two universally tight contact structures are given by surgeries on the unknot that has all of the stabilizations on the right or on the left , and the virtually overtwisted contact structures correspond to unknots stabilized on both sides .",
    "we construct planar open books for @xmath46 as follows .",
    "the standard legendrian unknot with @xmath47 can be represented as the core circle of a page of the open book decomposition of @xmath18 with annular pages ; to place the stabilized unknot on a page of an open book for @xmath18 , we stabilize the open book and modify the knot as described in @xcite , see figure [ stab ] .        in this setup , the page framing matches the thurston  bennequin framing of the legendrian unknot ; performing a positive dehn twist on the curve representing the unknot , we obtain an open book decomposition corresponding to the result of legendrian surgery .",
    "the resulting open book for @xmath46 is shown on figure [ lens - monodr ] : the page of the open book is a disk with @xmath48 holes , and the monodromy @xmath49 is the product of positive dehn twists @xmath50 around each of the holes except the @xmath41-th , and the positive dehn twists around the curves @xmath51 and @xmath52 . here",
    "the order of dehn twists is unimportant , because for a general open book it only matters up to cyclic permutation , and here the boundary twists commute with all other dehn twists .",
    "however , it is convenient to fix notation now :    throughout the paper , we adhere to braid notation for products of dehn twists : in the expression @xmath53 , @xmath54 is performed first .",
    "we first show that any positive factorization of @xmath55 consists of dehn twists enclosing the same holes .",
    "( in a disk with holes , every simple closed curve separates , and we say that a collection of holes is enclosed by a curve if the holes lie in the component not containing the outer boundary of the disk . abusing the language , we will often talk about holes enclosed by dehn twists . )",

    "( note : the conventions in @xcite are opposite ours and those used by most 4-manifold or symplectic topologists ; they use left - handed dehn twists as the positive generators of the presentation . )",
    "consider a round disk with punctures arranged at the vertices of a regular @xmath68-gon contained in the disk ; let the holes be small neighborhoods of the punctures , and denote by @xmath69 the resulting disk with @xmath68 holes .",
    "we say that a simple closed curve in @xmath69 is convex if it is isotopic to the boundary of the convex hull of some of the holes ; a dehn twist around a convex curve is said to be convex .",
    "by @xcite , the mapping class group has a presentation with generators given by all ( distinct ) convex dehn twists , and relations of the following two types .",
    "the first type states that dehn twists around disjoint curves commute .",
    "the second type consists of all possible lantern relations ; a lantern relation is the relation of the sort @xmath70 . here",
    "@xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 are disjoint collections of holes , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , etc , are convex dehn twists around the curves enclosing the corresponding sets of holes , and the collections @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 are such that the cyclic clockwise ordering of all the holes in @xmath76 , induced from their convex position on the disk , is compatible with the ordering where we list all holes from @xmath71 in their cyclic order , then all holes from @xmath72 , then all holes from @xmath73 .",
    "each collection @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 may contain one or more holes ; the ordering condition ensures that the dehn twists are performed around curves arranged as in the usual lantern relation .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "first , observe that although the set of holes enclosed by a simple closed @xmath77 does not determine @xmath77 up to isotopy , it determines , up to conjugacy , the class of the dehn twist @xmath78 in @xmath79 .",
    "( if @xmath77 , @xmath80 enclose the same holes , the conjugacy between @xmath78 and @xmath81 is given by the diffeomorphism @xmath82 that takes @xmath77 to @xmath80 . )",
    "consequently , the collection of holes enclosed by @xmath77 uniquely determines the image of @xmath78 in the homology @xmath83",
    ".    it will be helpful to decompose all dehn twists as follows : given a dehn twist @xmath78 around a convex curve @xmath77 that encloses @xmath84 holes , we apply the lantern relation repeatedly to write @xmath78 as a composition of dehn twists around ( convex ) curves enclosing all possible pairs of holes among the given @xmath84 , together with some dehn twists around single holes .",
    "each pair of holes will contribute exactly one positive convex dehn twist into this decomposition ; each hole will have @xmath85 negative dehn twists around it .",
    "similarly , we can decompose an arbitrary dehn twist in the same fashion ; however , the dehn twists enclosing pairs of holes will no longer have to be convex .",
    "we will refer to dehn twists around a pair of holes as `` pairwise '' dehn twists , and to dehn twists around single holes as boundary twists .",
    "( the dehn twist around the outer boundary component of the disk _ will not _ be referred to as a boundary twist . )",
    "now we can decompose an arbitary element @xmath86 : write it as a product of dehn twists , and decompose each of them as above .",
    "( we will not be recording the order of dehn twists in the monodromy . )",
    "let @xmath87 be the multiplicity of the positive dehn twist containing only the @xmath88-th and @xmath89-th holes in the decomposition of @xmath3 ; similarly , @xmath90 be the multiplicity of the positive dehn twist @xmath91 around the @xmath88-th hole .",
    "the collection of integers @xmath92 is well - defined for @xmath86 : because the multiplicities @xmath92 are invariant under lantern relations , they do not depend on the factorization of @xmath3 . moreover , the collection @xmath93 uniquely determines the image of @xmath3 in @xmath83 .",
    "let @xmath55 be the monodromy of the open book for @xmath46 pictured in figure [ lens - monodr ] .",
    "assume that @xmath55 is factored into a product of some positive dehn twists .",
    "pick the @xmath41-th hole , which is enclosed by both curves @xmath51 and @xmath52 in figure [ lens - monodr ] , and consider the dehn twists around it in the new factorization of @xmath55 .",
    "we consider only those dehn twists that enclose at least two holes ; suppose there are @xmath94 of them , and write @xmath95 for the number of holes they enclose .",
    "now , we compute the multiplicities of the pairwise and boundary twists for @xmath55 that involve the @xmath41-th hole . the dehn twists @xmath96 contribute @xmath97 positive pairwise dehn twists involving @xmath41-th hole ( @xmath98 for every @xmath99 ) and @xmath100 negative boundary twists around it .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath94 positive dehn twists contribute @xmath101 positive pairwise dehn twists involving the @xmath41-th hole , and @xmath102 negative boundary dehn twists .",
    "as the new factorization of @xmath55 may have some positive boundary twists @xmath103 that we havent yet taken into account , @xmath104    two cases are then possible :    \\(i ) @xmath105 , and the new positive factorization of @xmath55 has no boundary twists around the @xmath41-th hole , or    \\(ii ) @xmath106 , and there is exactly one positive boundary twist @xmath103 around the @xmath41-th hole .    to rule out the second case , notice that since @xmath107 for every @xmath99 , the unique positive dehn twist in the decomposition of @xmath55 would have to enclose all @xmath68 holes .",
    "but then we would have @xmath108 , which contradicts the original definition of @xmath55 from figure  [ lens - monodr ] .",
    "the first case then tells us that the new positive decomposition of @xmath55 has exactly two twists enclosing more than one hole each ; there may also be some positive boundary twists .",
    "examining the multiplicities @xmath109 , @xmath110 again , we see that one dehn twist must be around a curve that encloses the holes @xmath111 , the other around a curve that encloses the holes @xmath112 ; denote the first curve by @xmath66 , the second by @xmath67 .",

    "all of these contact structures can be represented by planar open books ; using wendl s theorem , we can prove that a contact structure is non - fillable ( in the strong symplectic sense ) by showing that its monodromy admits no positive factorization in the mapping class group of a disk with holes .",
