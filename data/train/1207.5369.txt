    "many interesting quantum phenomena have been found in condensed matter physics when electrons have a spin - orbit coupling , such as the spin hall effect and the topological insulator @xcite .",
    "ultracold atom systems are now regarded as simulation platforms to study condensed matter physics @xcite , therefore it is important to realize spin - orbit couplings in these systems .",
    "it has been shown theoretically that abelian and non - abelian gauge potentials can be simulated for ultracold atoms via their interaction with laser fields , and non - abelian gauge potentials can be used to generate spin - orbit couplings @xcite .",
    "a general spin - orbit coupling for ultracold atoms has not yet been realized experimentally , however some experimental progress towards this direction have been made @xcite .",
    "theoretical schemes to simulate spin - orbit couplings for ultracold atoms are usually proposed with atom - field interaction in the so called tripod configuration , where two dark states are used to form the effective spin space @xcite .",
    "these schemes have a drawback that the two dark states are not the lowest energy dressed states , hence atom - atom interactions can induce collisional decay .",
    "some authors also consider the simulation of spin - orbit coupling with atom - field interaction in the @xmath0 configuration , where two lowest energy dressed states are used to form the effective spin space @xcite .",
    "recently several experiments have realized the special spin - orbit coupling @xmath1 for ultracold atoms via raman process @xcite , which is a scheme of @xmath0 configuration with rabi frequencies much smaller than the detuning .",
    "some other kinds of methods are also proposed to simulate spin - orbit couplings in ultracold atom systems @xcite .",
    "although many interesting features of ultracold atoms have been theoretically found when they have a general spin - orbit coupling such as the rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit couplings , currently we can only experimentally achieve the special spin - orbit coupling @xmath1 for ultracold atoms via raman process .",
    "since raman process is a scheme of @xmath0 configuration with rabi frequencies much smaller than the detuning , it is natural to ask whether more general spin - orbit couplings can be simulated in @xmath0 configuration when rabi frequencies are not much smaller than the detuning .",
    "we find the answer is no at least in our concerned @xmath0 configuration .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "we first give an analytical expression of the simulated non - abelian gauge potentials in our concerned @xmath0 configuration , which can help us to design spin - orbit coupling simulation schemes based on those proposed in the tripod configuration .",
    "we then consider a spin - orbit coupling simulation scheme where two plane waves are used in the @xmath0 configuration .",
    "we find the simulated spin - orbit coupling can only be of a form similar to @xmath1 due to the non - degeneracy of the two lowest energy dressed states .",
    "we also analyze how the relative magnitude of the two lasers affect the simulated spin - orbit coupling hamiltonian in this scheme .",

    "the three eigenstates of @xmath14 are @xmath15 with the corresponding eigenvalues being @xmath16 the full quantum state of the atom can be written in the form @xmath17 .",
    "due to the position dependence of the dressed states @xmath18 , when we substitute the full quantum state @xmath19 into the schr@xmath20dinger equation with @xmath21 given in eq .",
    "( [ x1 ] ) , we can find that the column vector of wave functions @xmath22 satisfies the schr@xmath20dinger equation with hamiltonian @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are @xmath26 matrices : @xmath27 we note that @xmath24 and @xmath7 give contribution to the off - diagonal elements and @xmath28 give contribution to the diagonal elements of @xmath29 .",
    "since @xmath30 and @xmath13 , there are @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "now we discuss the condition when the off - diagonal elements of @xmath29 connecting @xmath33 to @xmath34 and @xmath35 to @xmath34 can be neglected , so that it can be used to simulate the movement of a particle with spin-1/2 .",
    "note that @xmath36 usually has a magnitude of momentum @xmath37 of the applied laser fields , therefore the off - diagonal elements of @xmath29 connecting @xmath33 to @xmath34 and @xmath35 to @xmath34 can be neglected when @xmath38 , @xmath39 and atoms move very slowly ( i.e. , @xmath40 ) .",
    "if these conditions are satisfied the wave functions @xmath41 will be approximately decoupled from @xmath34 and evolute under the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath42 here @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath43 are @xmath44 matrices , the elements of @xmath24 and @xmath25 are described in eq .",
