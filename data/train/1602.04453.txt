    "a new bosonic state with a mass around @xmath1 , which was discovered at the lhc a few years ago , can provide a window into new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the signal strengths associated with this particle are currently consistent with the sm higgs boson .",
    "however further exploration of this resonance can lead to new exciting discoveries .",
    "physics beyond the sm may change the higgs decay rates to sm particles and give rise to new decay modes . here",
    "we consider the decays of the sm - like higgs boson into a pair of pseudoscalar states within @xmath2 extensions of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "in particular we focus on the @xmath3 inspired susy models which are based on the low  energy sm gauge group together with an extra @xmath4 gauge symmetry defined by : @xmath5 gauge @xmath6and @xmath7 symmetries can originate from the breakings @xmath8 @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "different aspects of the phenomenology of these @xmath3 inspired supersymmetric ( susy ) models have been extensively studied in @xcite .",
    "these susy models imply that just below the scale @xmath11 the gauge symmetry in the @xmath3 grand unified theory ( gut ) is broken down to @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a matter parity . to ensure anomaly cancellation , gauge coupling unification and the appropriate breakdown of the gauge symmetry at low energies the matter content of the susy models under consideration involves three @xmath14 representations of the @xmath3 , two @xmath15 doublets @xmath16 and @xmath17 from extra @xmath18 and @xmath19 , two sm singlets @xmath20 and @xmath21 that carry non ",
    "zero @xmath0 charges and stem from another pair of @xmath22 and @xmath23 as well as a sm singlet @xmath24 that does not participate in gauge interactions . thus these models involve extra matter beyond the mssm . in particular , they include three pairs of @xmath15doublets ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) that have the quantum numbers of higgs doublets , and three pairs of colour triplets of exotic quarks",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 with electric charges @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively . to suppress flavour changing neutral currents as well as the most dangerous baryon and lepton number violating operators one can impose a discrete @xmath31 symmetry , under which all superfields except one pair of @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( say @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath24 are odd .",
    "the conservation of @xmath36 and @xmath31 symmetries implies that these models contain at least two states which are absolutely stable and can contribute to the dark matter density .",
    "one of these states is a lightest susy particle ( lsp ) whereas another one is the lightest ordinary neutralino . using the method proposed in @xcite",
    "it was argued that there is a theoretical upper bound on the mass of the lsp @xcite . in the simplest phenomenologically viable scenarios",
    "the lsp has a mass around @xmath37 or even smaller forming hot dark matter in the universe .",
    "the presence of such very light neutral fermions in the particle spectrum may have interesting implications for neutrino physics ( see , for example @xcite ) . in these scenarios",
    "the lightest ordinary neutralino can account for all or some of the observed dark matter density .",
    "the higgs sector of the susy models under consideration contains two higgs doublets @xmath38 and @xmath39 as well as @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath24 .",
    "the scalar components of the superfields @xmath20 and @xmath21 acquire large vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) that break the @xmath0 gauge symmetry inducing the masses of exotic particles and the @xmath40 boson .",
    "the interaction of @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath24 is determined by the following terms in the superpotential that can be written as @xmath41 when   the   couplings   @xmath42 ,   @xmath43 and @xmath44 are rather small these models possess   an   approximate global @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "this symmetry is spontaneously broken by the vevs of @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath24 leading to the presence of a light pseudoscalar state in the particle spectrum .",
    "our analysis indicates that the couplings of this state to the sm particles are always small .",
    "therefore even if this pseudoscalar is substantially lighter than @xmath45 it could escape detection at former and present collider experiments .",
    "moreover this state can be so light that it gives rise to the decays of the sm - like higgs boson into a pair of these pseudoscalar states .",
    "the branching ratio of such decays depends rather strongly on the values of the couplings that explicitly violate the global @xmath2 symmetry .    to simplify our analysis we set @xmath46 as well as @xmath47 and examine the dependence of the branching ratio of the exotic higgs decays on @xmath42 . for @xmath48 the pseudoscalar higgs boson with a mass of @xmath49",
    "can be obtained without fine - tuning but the branching ratio of the sm - like higgs decays into a pair of such particles is smaller than @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "thus it will be rather difficult to observe such decays at the lhc . if @xmath51 a fine tuning of at least @xmath52 is required to get the lightest cp - odd higgs state with mass of @xmath49",
    ". however the branching ratio of the corresponding exotic higgs decays can be larger than @xmath52 in this case @xcite .",
    "after being produced from such decays the lightest pseudoscalars decay into a pair of @xmath53-quarks or @xmath54-leptons resulting in four fermion final states .",
    "this work was supported by the university of adelaide and the australian research council through the arc center of excellence in particle physics at the terascale ."
