    "this article could well have been entitled  dual wavelet sets \" , but we felt that the three - way tiling property was the important feature to emphasize in the title .",
    "it concerns measurable sets which are simultaneously dilation - translation and dilation - reflection wavelet sets , whose existence was shown in @xcite , and whose classification has hardly begun .",
    "this represents follow - up research to the article @xcite and - in a different way - is related to the article @xcite .    in the article @xcite , section 7 , the authors show that if @xmath5 is an expansive matrix and @xmath6 and @xmath7 an affine weyl group , then there exists a measurable set @xmath8 of finite measure such that @xmath9 and @xmath10 both form measurable tilings of @xmath11 , and moreover such two - way tiling sets always exist if @xmath2 is expansive .",
    "these were called @xmath12-_dilation - reflection wavelet sets_. on the other hand , it is well known that if @xmath13 is a full rank lattice , i.e. , a co - compact discrete subgroup of @xmath11 , then a measurable set @xmath14 is a @xmath15-_dilation - translation wavelet set _ , in the usual sense , if and only if @xmath16 and @xmath17 both form measurable tilings of @xmath11 . it was shown in @xcite that @xmath15-dilation - translation wavelet sets always exist .",
    "so theorem 7.4 of @xcite completely generalizes corollary 1 of @xcite to the case where an arbitrary affine weyl group replaces the arbitrary translation group in the theorem .    in chapter 8 of @xcite",
    ", the authors noted that two examples given of dilation - reflection wavelet sets were actually `` three - way tiling sets '' in the sense that they tiled @xmath1 under three groups : dilation , reflection , and translation .",
    "in other words , they were both dilation - translation wavelet sets in the traditional sense and also dilation - reflection wavelet sets , for the same dilation group but with a reflection group ( i.e. , an affine weyl group ) replacing the usual translation group .",
    "in fact these sets were known dyadic wavelet sets in the plane : the so - called  wedding cake set \" and  four - corners set \" given in @xcite not only did they tile the plane under dilation by @xmath18 and translation by @xmath19 along the @xmath20 coordinate axes , but they also tiled the plane under an affine weyl group whose corresponding foldable figure was a square .",
    "questions were then raised as to whether three - way - tilers were rare or common .",
    "our results in the present paper indicate that they are more common than we expected .",
    "however , the dependence of the full rank lattice ( the translation group ) on the foldable figure ( and hence the affine weyl group ) can not be completely removed .",
    "a simple restriction is that a cell for the lattice must have the same lebesgue measure as that of the foldable figure . the question is whether this is the only restriction or whether it is also necessary that the intersection of the lattice with the affine weyl group is also a full rank lattice .",
    "we will prove that given any foldable figure @xmath21 in the plane containing the origin @xmath22 in its interior , and given any expansive dilation matrix @xmath2 , there is a full rank lattice @xmath13 which depends on @xmath21 but not on @xmath2 , such that a measurable set @xmath8 exists , which tiles @xmath1 under each of the groups @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath7 , where the latter is the affine weyl group determined by the reflections about the bounding hyperplanes of @xmath21 .    by applying proposition 8.1 from @xcite ( see proposition 3.1 below ) , the proof reduces to showing that given such a @xmath21 , there is a full rank lattice @xmath7 which has a lattice cell congruent to @xmath21 under the action of @xmath7 ( see definition of congruence below ) , such that the intersection of @xmath13 with the affine weyl group @xmath25 is itself a full rank lattice .",
    "in this section we give a short exposition of wavelets and wavelet sets .",
    "we also discuss some relations to finite coxeter groups and affine weyl groups .",
    "standard reference for wavelet sets are the articles @xcite and for the connection with finite and affine weyl groups @xcite .",
    "the @xmath26-dimensional fourier transform on @xmath27 is defined by @xmath28 for all @xmath29 . here",
    "@xmath30 is the product lebesgue measure on @xmath11 and @xmath31 is the standard inner product .",
    "the fourier transform extends to a unitary isomorphism of @xmath27 onto itself .",
    "for @xmath32 the inverse of the fourier transform is given by @xmath33    let @xmath2 be an expansive @xmath34 real matrix ( i.e. , all eigenvalues of @xmath2 have absolute value @xmath35 ) .",
    "( see ( @xcite , remark 2.1 for six equivalent definitions of congruence . )",
    "let @xmath36 be a full rank lattice in @xmath37 .",
    "equivalently , there exists a basis ( not - necessarily orthogonal ) @xmath38 for @xmath11 such that @xmath36 is the group of translations by vectors from the group @xmath39 . for convenience ,",
    "let @xmath36 also denote this set of vectors , i.e. , we identify @xmath36 and the subset of @xmath11 given by @xmath40 . by a _",

    "it is obvious that if @xmath56 and @xmath53 are @xmath48-congruent , then @xmath56 is a @xmath51- measurable @xmath48-tile of @xmath49 ( i.e. , a fundamental domain for @xmath48 ) if and only if @xmath53 is a @xmath51-measurable @xmath48-tile for @xmath49 .",

    "so for such a group , all @xmath48-tiles ( if any exist ) must have the same measure . for a group which does not consist of measure - preserving transformations , such as a dilation group on @xmath11 , @xmath48-congruence can change measures of sets , and @xmath48-tiles can have widely differing measures .    a theorem from @xcite states that a measurable subset @xmath8 of @xmath11 is a dilation-@xmath2 , translation-@xmath36 , wavelet set if and only if @xmath8 tiles @xmath11 under both the dilation group @xmath59 and the translation group @xmath60 which is also a full rank lattice , _ the dual lattice _ of @xmath36 .",
    "this was first proven for the case @xmath61 in @xcite , and extended to @xmath11 in @xcite together with a proof that such wavelet sets always exist for expansive dilations .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that , under the fourier transform the translation by @xmath62 is transformed into modulation by @xmath63 .",
    "it was first proved by fuglede in @xcite , see below , that a measurable set @xmath8 tiles @xmath11 under @xmath64 if and only if @xmath65 forms an orthonormal basis for @xmath66 , which , together with the tiling property under @xmath67 is needed to construct an orthonormal basis for @xmath68 .",

    "several people worked on this conjecture and derived important results and validated the conjecture for some special cases , see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "however , in 2003 , tao @xcite showed that the conjecture is false in dimension @xmath73 and higher if the lattice hypothesis is dropped .",
    "the other direction was disproved by kolountzakis and matolcsi in @xcite . but even now , after the spectral - tiling conjecture has been proven to fail in higher dimensions , it is still interesting and important to understand better the connection between spectral properties and tiling in particular , because of the connection to wavelet sets .      in order to proceed ,",

    "where @xmath182 , we abbreviate @xmath180 to @xmath183 .    in the above definition , the reason @xmath179 is prescribed is that in order to apply the methods of @xcite for two - way tilers , it is simplest to assume that the dilation fixed point be contained in the interior of the model for abstract translation tiler , namely the foldable figure @xmath21 in this case .",
    "( it is not a necessary restriction , but on the other hand some kind of restriction such as this is necessary .",
    "it is a sufficient restriction to make the apparatus work . ) then , to make the dilation by @xmath2 _",
    "compatable _ with the action of the reflection group ( i.e. , so that @xmath179 is a fixed point for the dilation transformation group ) the usual dilation by @xmath2 is replaced with the affine dilation mapping @xmath184 . in practice , in proofs in particular , we frequently perform an initial translation of the system so that @xmath182 , and dilations thus correspond to the usual dilation group . on the other hand , in reflection group",
    "theory one usually performs an initial translation of a geometric problem so that the orgin @xmath22 lies at a _",
    "vertex _ of the foldable figure , hence not an interior point .",
    "hence , in particular in the analysis of the _ root systems _ ( see below ) , this is the assumption made . a simple translation of the system then yields the general case .",
    "thus , basically , in order to apply our theory ( in its present form ) , we either need to assume up - front that @xmath22 is an interior point of @xmath21 and use the usual dilation group @xmath185 , or we need to fix a designated point @xmath179 in the interior of @xmath21 and use the affine dilation group generated by @xmath186 .    as a foldable figure @xmath21 supports an orthonormal basis for @xmath187 of fractal surface functions , similar to the way a dilation - translation wavelet set @xmath8 supports an orthonormal basis of exponential functions , and if we compose these fractal surface functions with the reflection group congruence operations we obtain an orthonormal basis of fractal - surface - induced functions on the dilation - reflection wavelet set @xmath8 .",
    "since @xmath8 tiles @xmath11 under dilation by @xmath2 , by the dilations by powers of @xmath2 to these functions we obtain a fractal surface induced orthonormal basis of @xmath188 .",
    "so in a function - theoretic sense as well as in a set theoretic sense ( i.e. , tiling properties ) , the dilation - reflection wavelet sets are natural generalizations of the dilation - translation wavelet sets : they are both affiliated with orthonormal bases of @xmath188 .",
    "the main result of @xcite is :    [ 100 ] there exist @xmath180-wavelet sets for every choice of @xmath177 , @xmath179 , and @xmath2 .      in @xcite the connection between weyl groups ( of finite reflection groups )",
    "was looked at from a slightly different point of view .",
    "most of the examples of wavelet sets tend to be fractal like and symmetric around @xmath22 .",
    "the first aim was to construct wavelet functions that have some directional properties in the frequency domain .",
    "the direction is given by a fundamental domain @xmath21 for the weyl group , which is also a convex cone , i.e. , @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "the wavelets are again given by the inverse fourier transform of the normalized indicator function of a measurable subset @xmath46 .",
    "assuming that @xmath191 , and @xmath192 , then it was shown , that one can find a set @xmath193 , such that @xmath46 tiles @xmath21 under @xmath194 and tiles @xmath11 under @xmath64 , i.e , @xmath46 is a @xmath195-subspace wavelet set .",
    "the weyl group is then used to rotate the frequency domain to cover all of @xmath11 .",
    "the construction was still fractal , but the result is not symmetric around @xmath22 anymore .",
    "a natural question one asks when working with wavelets is whether they are related with any multiresolution analysis or multiwavelets .",
    "it was shown that it is possible to construct subspace multiwavelets using the weyl group .",
    "in particular , the wavelets are still directional in the frequency domain .",
    "in fact , the support of the fourier transform is supported in cones which are fundamental domains for the action of a weyl group on the euclidian space . finally , the relation between those constructions and sampling theory were discussed .",
    "any square - integrable function can be written as a sum of its projections on subspaces , where each subspace contains only signals supported in the frequency domain in the cones mentioned above .",
    "each projection can then be sampled using a version of the whittaker - shannon - kotelnikov sampling theorem .",
    "the following proposition was proven in @xcite , which covers the cases of the four - corners and wedding - cake sets , as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "we will give a less general version than we gave in @xcite because it suffices for our purposes in this article .",
    "[ proposition 8.1 in @xcite ] suppose that @xmath21 is any foldable figure which is a fundamental domain for both a translation group @xmath36 and the affine weyl group @xmath3 for @xmath21 , and which contains @xmath22 in its interior .",
    "if the intersection group @xmath196 of @xmath36 and @xmath3 contains a full rank lattice , then for any expansive matrix @xmath2 there exist sets @xmath8 which are simultaneously dilation @xmath2-translation @xmath36 and dilation @xmath2-reflection @xmath3 wavelet sets .",
    "the version of the above proposition that was stated in @xcite only required that the intersection group @xmath196 in the hypothesis be large enough so that the prescribed dilation group @xmath67 together with @xmath196 form an abstract dilation - translation pair in the sense of @xcite .",

    "we quote a problem that the authors of @xcite pose at the end of section 8 .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to provide some examples that settle a part of this problem affirmatively , indicating that three - way - tilers could be common .",

    "but we know of no other general restriction that we can prove .    attempting to address this situation ,",
