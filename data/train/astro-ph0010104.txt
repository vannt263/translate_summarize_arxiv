    "according to general relativity , light from distant objects such as quasars is affected by the large - scale distribution of the intervening masses , and , consequently , these act as gravitational lenses .",
    "a gravitational lens enlarges the solid angle of the source and conserves its surface brightness .",
    "so at the same time it brings to view faint objects ( magnification bias ) and dilutes their population density . these two antagonistic effects can generate either correlation or anti - correlation between the angular distribution of background and foreground objects ( see e.g. schneider , ehlers & falco 1992 ) .",
    "several studies have explored the correlation between qso s and galaxies at various wavelengths .",
    "for example , bartelmann & schneider ( 1994 ) found a statistically significant correlation between 1jy sources and iras galaxies for quasars at high redshifts . also , bentez & martnez - gonzlez ( 1997 ) reported statistically significant correlations between cosmos / ukst galaxies and pks radio quasars , and bentez , sanz & martnez - gonzlez ( 2001 ) found positive correlations using radio - loud quasars from the 1jy and half - jansky samples .",
    "these results were obtained for small angles on the sky ( of the order of 10 arcmin ) .",
    "recently , williams & irwin ( 1998 ) investigated the correlation between qso s from the lbqs catalog and galaxies from the apm survey and detected a significant positive angular correlation , ranging from scales of 10 arcmin to over a degree . for a more extended review of observational data",

    "an analytical theory of the galaxy - qso correlation due to weak gravitational lensing was introduced by bartelmann ( 1995 ) , dolag & bartelmann ( 1997 ) , hereafter b95 and db97 , and sanz , martnez - gonzlez & bentez ( 1997 ) , having as base the work by kaiser ( 1992 ) .",
    "we will review the theory briefly in section 2 .",
    "the predicted correlations between galaxies and qso s agree reasonably well with some observations for angles below 10 arcmin .",
    "however , williams & irwin ( 1998 ) claim that for larger angular scales theory and observations differ by one order of magnitude for standard cosmological models such as cold dark matter ( @xmath0 ) and cold dark matter with a cosmological constant ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "although this conclusion has to be tested with future observations , it is of importance to investigate the predictions of the galaxy - qso correlation for a large class of cosmologies . the effect of bias , matter content and current expansion rate has to be investigated in detail",
    "this will be the aim of this paper , where we keep the assumption that the weak lensing approximation is valid .",
    "effects of higher order terms are not investigate here .",
    "these contributions where estimated recently by williams ( 2000 ) , and were shown to increase the amplitude by less than 10 per cent for nearby large - scale coherent structures .",
    "our investigations show that the observations of correlations between qsos and galaxies on large angular scales can provide independent information relevant to structure formation understanding , and are somewhat sensitive to the values of a set of cosmological parameters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the theoretical formalism used",
    ". in section 3 we present the cosmological models we consider in our investigation and study their predictions .",
    "the models include mixed dark matter and quintessence models , as well as isocurvature and cosmic string based models of structure formation .",
    "we analyze in detail the effect of several cosmological parameters on the galaxy - qso correlation in a flat universe with cosmological constant and initial adiabatic fluctuations .",
    "we discuss our findings and some observational data in section 4 .",
    "in this section we review the theory of the correlation between galaxies and qsos based on weak gravitational lensing .",
    "we follow closely bartelmann ( 1995 ) and dolag & bartelmann ( 1997 ) . however , we extend the theory by allowing for a scale- and time - dependent bias , and by using an improved mass power spectrum ( e.g. by taking into account the baryon density and properly evolving non - linear density fields ) .",
    "we define the angular correlation function @xmath2 between galaxies and high - redshift qso s as @xmath3 \\left [ \\frac { n_g ( \\vec{\\theta}+ \\vec{\\phi})}{\\bar{n}_g } -1 \\right ]    \\right >   \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the qso and galaxy densities ( a bar over a quantity indicates its mean value ) , and @xmath6 represents the average over @xmath7 and the direction of @xmath8 ( but not its modulus ) . assuming weak gravitational lensing ( i.e. that the magnification field contrast @xmath9 is small , @xmath10 ) , and a brightness distribution of the cumulative quasar number density as a function of flux @xmath11 of the form @xmath12",

    "the magnification fluctuations @xmath9 derive from the inhomogeneities in the mass distribution , since these create a gravitational potential topography which deflects light , and therefore generates a shear field .",
    "the calculation of this shear field ( which assumes a statistically homogeneous and isotropic density field and a newtonian weak field approximation for gravity ) , and the results involving the power spectra of projections of three - dimensional fields , obtained by kaiser ( 1992 ) , allows one to derive the expression [ equation ( 12 ) of db97 generalized for a scale and time dependent bias factor @xmath15 ( bentez & sanz 1999 ) ] @xmath16   \\ , ,   \\label{main}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the comoving distance which here parameterizes time ( @xmath18 represents a redshift @xmath19 ) , and @xmath20 is the wavenumber of the density contrast in a plane wave expansion ; @xmath21 is the matter density parameter ; @xmath22 is the time evolved mass power spectrum ; @xmath23 is the zeroth - order bessel function of first kind ; and @xmath24 is the curvature - dependent radial distance ( @xmath25 for a flat universe ) .",

    "we further consider a scale- and time - dependent bias factor , which we assume can be written as @xmath75 .",
    "the scale - dependent part of the bias is defined as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is an empirical galaxy power spectrum . we use ( unless indicated ) the spectrum obtained from the apm survey ( gaztaaga & baugh 1998 ) . the time - dependent part of the bias can be modeled as ( tegmark & peebles 1998 ) @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the linear bias factor today ( equation [ [ lbias ] ] ) , @xmath80 is the dimensionless correlation coefficient between the distributions of mass and galaxies , and @xmath81 ( equation [ [ growth ] ] ) .",
    "however , we found that the time dependence is negligible ( even considering a galaxy population at a higher redshift and a strong time dependence of the bias the effect is very small ) , so for simplicity one can neglect it .",

    "it is a multiplicative factor of the whole expression in equation ( [ main ] ) , it determines the general geometric scaling of the problem through the scale factor , and it also enters in the mass power spectrum ( and consequently in the bias , too ) through the shape parameter , the growth function , and normalization .",
    "we investigate the dependence of the galaxy - qso correlation on the matter content of a flat universe in fig .",
    "[ flatv - m ] . as would be expected , a higher matter content generates more power of the mass spectrum on small scales , which results in a higher correlation between galaxies and qso s ( mainly at small angles ) .",

    "the same conclusion is valid if we normalize the @xmath100 spectra to the cluster abundance , which also depends on @xmath101 according to wang & steinhardt ( 1998 ) .",
    "note that , because the larger scale structures are the most affected by the coefficient of the quintessence equation of state , the effect on the correlation is more dramatic at large angles .",

    "a normalization to the cluster abundance requires @xmath105 [ see avelino , wu & shellard ( 2000 ) ; a somewhat smaller normalization was obtained by van de bruck ( 1999 ) ] .",
    "both scenarios are in serious trouble if considered as the only mechanism responsible for structure formation .",
    "however , hybrid models are still allowed and maybe even favored by the first results from the boomerang data ( bernardis et al .",

    "our results for these two alternative models for structure formation are compared with the adiabatic case in fig .",
    "[ alternative ] . both predict a steeper slope for @xmath88 than adiabatic fluctuations .",
    "this is because their power spectra have more power on smaller scales relative to large ones than the adiabatic spectrum .",

    "can be roughly characterized by an amplitude and a slope . the amplitude is closely related to the normalization of the mass power spectrum , and the slope to its shape .",
    "more power on small scales ( large @xmath20 ) implies a steeper slope . this is a reflection of the fact that the amount of small scale structure is responsible for the galaxy - qso correlation on small angles and larger structures are responsible for the correlation on larger angles .",
    "this simplicity of behavior results in a relatively large degeneracy of @xmath88 as a function of the cosmological parameters and models analyzed . in brief , a higher value of @xmath92 , @xmath44 , or @xmath97 has nearly the same effect on @xmath88 as a lower value of @xmath93 , or @xmath57 .",
    "this effect is a higher correlation on small angles .",
    "roughly , this represents a steeper slope for @xmath88 , which can be also achieved by shifting @xmath101 closer to zero , or by introducing an isocurvature or cosmic string component .",
    "the main lesson given by the use of different theoretical mass power spectra is that the galaxy - qso correlation at different angles contains information about the amount of structure at different scales .",
    "our calculations fully incorporate galaxy biasing .",
    "this requires the use of an empirical galaxy power spectrum .",

    "we show the effect of this alternative choice at fig .",

    "[ observations ] some points obtained from observations .",
    "a direct comparison among the different data sets is not possible , because they were obtained from different qso and galaxy populations .",
    "for the same reason a strict comparison between these observational points and the theoretical predictions shown is not possible .",
    "that would require an individual calculation for each of the data sets , which would take in account the different redshift distributions for qsos and galaxies , and also the particular power spectrum of the foreground population ( galaxies or galaxy groups ) .",
    "this would be necessary because when selection criteria are applied to a foreground object catalog the effective power spectrum of the resulting subset is possibly different from the spectrum of the whole population .",
    "a rigorous analysis of the data would also require considerations about observational particularities such as the possible effects of dust and systematics .",
    "that is not our aim here .",

    "<S> we use weak gravitational lensing theory to calculate this angular correlation , updating previous calculations and presenting new results exploring the dependence of the correlation on the large - scale structure . </S>",
    "<S> we study the dependence of the predictions on a variety of cosmological models , such as cold dark matter models , mixed dark matter models , and models based on quintessence . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the dependence on the assumptions made about the nature of the primordial fluctuation spectrum : adiabatic , isocurvature and power spectra motivated by the cosmic string scenario are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> special attention is paid to the issue of galaxy biasing , which is fully incorporated . </S>",
    "<S> we show that different mass power spectra imply distinct predictions for the angular correlation , and therefore the angular correlation provides an extra source of information about cosmological parameters and mechanisms of structure formation . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results with observational data and discuss their potential uses . in particular , it is suggested that the observational determination of the galaxy - qso correlation may be used to give an independent measurement of the mass power spectrum </S>",
