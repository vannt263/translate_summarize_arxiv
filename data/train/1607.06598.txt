    "laser scattering involving stimulated brillouin scattering ( sbs ) , i.e. , the coupling of a large amplitude light wave into a scattered light wave plus an ion acoustic wave ( iaw ) , @xcite play an important role in the successful ignition goal of inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) @xcite .",
    "many methods have been used to reduce the sbs @xcite scattering level , such as increasing the landau damping of ion - acoustic waves@xcite and the saturation of ion - acoustic wave @xcite .",

    "multiple ion species are contained in the laser fusion program .",
    "the presence of multiple ion species can add additional branches to the iaw dispersion relation and change the total landau damping significantly , which may provide the possibility of controlling sbs by increasing the linear damping of the iaw.@xcite when the external driving electric field is on , the trapping of particles will reduce landau damping , if the time of the driver is long enough , the landau damping will be nearly zero.@xcite at the same time , the dispersion of the small amplitude nonlinear iaw will be altered .",
    "the linear kinetic theory of ion acoustic waves in two ion species plasmas was researched by e. a. williams et al . in detail.@xcite there , @xmath5 was taken , the linear frequency of the iaw was thought to be the resonance frequency of the iaw . in this paper",

    "when the wave amplitude was small enough , the solutions in the limit @xmath9 corresponded to the infinitesimal amplitude bernstein - greene - kruskal ( bgk ) modes@xcite , which was consistent to that found by holloway and dorning.@xcite their results were for the electron plasma waves while in this paper the resonance condition is applied to iaws in multi species plasmas especially for the infinitesimal amplitude bgk modes . in this paper ,",

    "when @xmath2 increases , the linear landau damping of the fast mode will increase obviously in the region of @xmath10 .",
    "however , this result is for the linear situation .",
    "when the driving electric field is on , the distribution of the particles will keep flat at the phase velocity of the iaw , thus turning off the linear landau damping . as a result , the deviation between the frequency calculated by the linear dispersion relation and that by the dispersion relation with no damping becomes larger with @xmath2 increasing .",
