    "the ability to manipulate liquids on microfluidic chips is essential to the functionality of micro total analysis systems  @xcite and recently there has been quite some interest in utilizing ac electrical surface potentials for pumping , manipulating , and mixing electrolytes . for an overview of electro - hydrodynamics and ac electro - osmosis we refer to refs .  and references therein .",
    "in this paper we consider the rc model in ref .   of an electrolyte confined by an insulating surface with an applied external potential of the general form @xmath7 here , @xmath8 is the driving frequency and @xmath9 is a dimensionless function representing the amplitude variations along the surface . for simplicity",
    "we consider a binary electrolyte with permeability @xmath10 , viscosity @xmath11 , and conductivity @xmath12 . assuming a low pclet number we may neglect convection so that the electrodynamics can formally be solved independently of the hydrodynamics . on the other hand the hydrodynamics of course still depends on the electrodynamics through the body force which effectively may be taken into account through a finite slip velocity , see e.g. refs .   and references therein .",
    "for the electrodynamics we follow ajdari  @xcite with the surface and the debye layer each represented by a capacitive element while the bulk - liquid is represented by an ohmic element .",
    "the model applies to the situation where spatial variations along the surface are slow on the length scale of the debye screening length @xmath13 , the driving frequency is small compared to the debye frequency @xmath14 , and the electrostatic energy is small compared to the thermal energy @xmath15 , i.e. the debye ",
    "hckel approximation is valid .",
    "as shown by many , the model may be justified in detail starting from a non - equilibrium electro - hydrodynamic continuum description . for more details",
    "we refer to refs .   as well as   and references therein .    in the bulk of the liquid",
    "there is charge neutrality and the electrical potential @xmath16 thus fulfills the laplace equation @xmath17 subject to the relation between surface charge @xmath18 and the potential drop across the capacitive element @xmath19 as well as a continuity equation @xmath20 relating the change in surface charge to the electrical ohmic current @xmath21 . above",
    ", @xmath22 is a series capacitance with @xmath23 being the intrinsic surface capacitance and @xmath24 being the debye layer capacitance .",
    "we formally solve this problem by introducing the inverse fourier transform @xmath25 of @xmath9 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : vext ] ) , @xmath26 from the solution of the spatially harmonic problem  @xcite we may write the general solutions for the potential and the surface charge as @xmath27 and @xmath28 above , we have introduced the frequency dependent effective length scale @xmath29 given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the capacitance ratio and @xmath32 is the debye frequency .",
    "the slip velocity is given by  @xcite @xmath33_{x=0},\\ ] ] where it is implicit that real values of @xmath18 and @xmath16 must be taken . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : phi ] ) and ( [ eq : sigmad ] ) we now formally get @xmath34 and for the time - averaged slip - velocity @xmath35 we use that @xmath36 as well as @xmath37 so that @xmath38 eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vs ] ) and ( [ eq : vs_t ] ) are our general results for the surface - potential induced hydrodynamics .",
    "velocity and pressure fields may be obtained by solving the navier  stokes equation without body - forces subject to a slip - velocity condition .    before turning our attention to specific potentials",
    "we may already extract some general properties of the model . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : vs_t ] ) it is clear that @xmath39 is a spatially dependent function of finite magnitude .",
    "this in turn also means that the external potential can induce a finite time - averaged velocity field in the fluid .",
    "however , it is also clear that the induced net flow rate will be zero since @xmath39 has no spatial dc - component , as may be seen by substituting the general expression for @xmath25 .",
    "spatial asymmetry in the applied potential is thus not a sufficient condition to achieve pumping and as also indicated in ref .",
    ", asymmetry in the surface capacitance is required .",
    "formal studies of the model for @xmath40 will be an interesting subject for future studies , but here we will follow the lines were @xmath23 is constant along the surface . the case of @xmath41",
    "was first studied in ref .  .",
    "the fourier transform is then a simple sum of two dirac delta functions , @xmath42 , and substituting into eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vs ] ) or ( [ eq : vs_t ] ) we easily arrive at results fully consistent with those reported previously .",
    "in order to draw some general conclusions about the frequency dynamics of the hydrodynamics , apart from the frequency doubling @xcite , we imagine that the surface potential has a characteristic length scale @xmath43 . since we have made an rc description of the electro - hydrodynamics it follows quite naturally that the system will have a resonance behavior at a frequency comparable to the inverse rc time of the system . above resonance",
    "the system has an asymptotic power - law frequency response as we will illustrate below for a surface potential of even symmetry . in that case @xmath25",
    "is a real and even function of @xmath44 , so that eq .",
    "( [ eq : vs_t ] ) with @xmath45 becomes @xmath46 where we have introduced a characteristic resonance frequency  @xmath47 as well as a characteristic flow velocity @xmath48 , @xmath49 since @xmath50[\\omega^2+(s')^2]}\\\\&=(s - s ' )     \\omega^{-2}+{\\cal     o}\\left(\\omega^{-4}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we expect with @xmath51 that @xmath52 likewise , for surface potentials of odd symmetry we arrive at the same conclusion . making a similar expansion for",
    "the below - resonance asymptote one might speculate that @xmath53 with a power @xmath54 .",
    "however , with such an expansion the integrals are in general no longer convergent which in turn indicates that the power @xmath2 is below 2 depending on the actual surface potential under consideration . in the following",
    "we will illustrate this by the aid of two explicit examples .",
    "recently , a circulating flow was observed experimentally using two adjacent electrodes and an ac field @xcite and in ref .",
    "@xcite the problem was studied theoretically by assuming that the two electrodes are infinitely close corresponding to a step - like model potential .",
    "however , such a potential is somewhat unphysical since the electric field diverges and instead one should take the electrode gap into account  @xcite . in the following we model such an electrode configuration with a smooth external potential of the form @xmath55 which incorporates the built - in electrode gap in terms of the length scale @xmath43 .",
    "fourier transforming and substituting into eq .",
    "( [ eq : vs_t ] ) we get @xmath56 where the resonance frequency is given by @xmath57 . in order to study the maximal value of @xmath39 as a function of frequency we note",
    "that when @xmath39 is maximal so is its slope at @xmath58 .",
    "if we define @xmath59 we get @xmath60 where we have introduced @xmath61 .",

    "the plot confirms eq .",
    "( [ eq : aboveresonance ] ) and suggests a linear dependence @xmath63 for the below - resonance frequency response .",
    "this may also confirmed by an asymptotic analysis by first noting that @xmath64 .",

    "we similarly note that @xmath69 so that @xmath70 . when collecting terms we thus get a @xmath8-dependence to lowest order .      as a second example we consider single - electrode driven electro - hydrodynamics and as a model potential we use @xmath71 to mimic the potential of a single electrode with a characteristic width @xmath43 .",
    "fourier transforming and substituting into eq .",
    "( [ eq : vs_t ] ) we get @xmath72 where in this case @xmath73 is the resonance frequency . in analogy with the previous example we get @xmath74 panel ( c ) in fig .",

    "we note that @xmath77 and @xmath78 where @xmath79 is catalan s constant . for @xmath80",
    "it follows that @xmath81 ^ 2 \\simeq -2\\omega \\int_0^\\infty ds\\ , s/[\\omega^2 +     s^2]^2= - \\omega^{-1}$ ] so that @xmath82 .",
    "there will thus be a logarithmic correction @xmath83 to the @xmath84 dependence .",
    "in this work we have used a fourier transform approach to make a general analysis of the frequency dynamics of ac - induced electro - hydrodynamics within the rc model of ref .  .",
    "in the case with a spatially constant intrinsic surface capacitance we generally prove that the net flow rate is zero .",
    "a finite net flow rate will require a spatially inhomogeneous capacitance so that the charge and electrical field dynamics are mutually out of phase .    for the frequency dynamics",
    "we observe a resonance behavior at a frequency corresponding to the inverse rc time of the system and different surface potentials share the common feature that the resonance frequency is inversely proportional to the characteristic length scale of the surface potential . above resonance",
    "we in general find a @xmath0 power law for surface potentials with either even or odd symmetry .",
    "below resonance we likewise find a power - law dependence @xmath1 with @xmath2 being positive and dependent of the properties of the surface potential . as two examples",
    "we have compared @xmath3 ( odd symmetry ) and @xmath4 ( even symmetry ) surface potential .",
    "unexpectedly , we qualitatively find the same slip velocity , while the frequency dynamics is very different for the below - resonance frequency response where power law asymptotics with @xmath5 and @xmath76 , respectively , are found .",
    "our study illustrates how the frequency dynamics carries strong fingerprints of the driving surface potential and we believe that detailed analysis of the frequency dynamics would be a way to extract more information from experimental data .",
    "recent related work  @xcite also suggests the possibility for a strong frequency dependence in ac electroosmosis also in the flow topology .",
