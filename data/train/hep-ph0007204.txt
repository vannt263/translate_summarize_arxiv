    "charm ii and ccfr collaborations observed production of @xmath5-pairs in @xmath6-scattering data sample and soon more precise data will be available @xcite .",
    "the data are well described by the standard model through the diagram shown in fig.1 , where local 4-fermion interaction represents @xmath7- and @xmath8-exchanges .",
    "if one assumes that @xmath9 has nonzero magnetic moment another mechanism of @xmath5 production shown in fig.2 comes into play .",
    "the two mechanisms of @xmath10-production do not interfere , so one should simply add probabilities , compare them with experimental data and get in this way the bound on @xmath11 .",
    "looking at the diagram in fig.2 we observe that substituting an electrically charged particle instead of neutrino one obtains the reaction of the lepton pair production in the collision of two charged particles .",
    "this reaction is well studied in the literature .",
    "the first paper was published in 1934 by l.d.landau and e.m.lifshitz @xcite , who observed that the cross section of @xmath12 pair production in the collision of two nuclei grows with the energy of colliding nuclei @xmath13 as @xmath14 . in 60 s ,",
    "when a physical program for @xmath12-colliders was prepared , the particle production by fusion diagrams was investigated in detail ; for a review see @xcite .",
    "in particular , subleading terms were calculated .",
    "however as far as we know , the case when one of the colliding particles is neutral and emits photon by nonzero magnetic moment was not studied in literature .",
    "so in this paper the corresponding cross section is calculated for the first time .",
    "we observe that it increases with the energy as @xmath15 , i.e. even faster than in the case of a charged particle .",
    "the calculation of the cross section consists of two parts . in section 2 formulas for the spectrum and for the total cross section of @xmath5 pair production in the reaction @xmath16",
    "are presented in a leading logarithmic approximation .",
    "section 3 contains the precise formulas which describe @xmath17 reaction . in section 4 with the help of the equivalent photon ( weiszacker - williams ) approximation the spectrum of the muon pairs obtained in section 2",
    "is converted into that in reaction @xmath18 and the total cross section of this reaction in the leading approximation is determined . in section 5 the numerical estimates",
    "are compared with the experimental data . in conclusions",
    "we qualitatively compare the cases of photoproduction on the charged and neutral particles and , in particular , demonstrate how @xmath19 dependence in a magnetic case converts to @xmath20 dependence in an electric case .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath5-pair photoproduction on neutrino is described by two diagrams shown in fig.3 .",
    "the photon emission by neutrino is described by the following vertex : @xmath21    it is convenient to use the recursion relation for three final particles phase space : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the sum of the muon momenta @xmath24 ( all momenta are defined in fig.3 ) , and to perform the integration of the square of the amplitude just in the order , shown in ( [ 2 ] ) . leaving precise formulas for the next section , here we trace the derivation of the cross section in the leading logarithmic approximation . after the integration over the direction of @xmath25-meson momenta which is conveniently performed in the center of mass system of two muons",
    "we come to the following double differential cross section : @xmath26 \\;\\ ; , \\label{3}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is virtuality of the photon and @xmath28 . integrating eq.([3 ] )",
    "over @xmath29 in the domain @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , we obtain : @xmath33    finally , integrating eq.([4 ] ) over @xmath34 in the domain @xmath35 we get with the double logarithmic accuracy : @xmath36    let us note that the log factor in eq.([4 ] ) @xmath37 comes from the integration over directions of muon momenta and corresponds to @xmath38 part of the diagram ( lower block in fig.3 ) , while the second log in eq.([5 ] ) comes from the integration over the mass of @xmath39-pair @xmath34 .",
    "in this section precise formulas which describe the process @xmath40 shown in fig.3 will be presented .",
    "we start from the double differential cross section @xmath41 , where @xmath42 equals the minus square of the momentum of a virtual photon and @xmath43 is the invariant mass of @xmath5-pair .",
    "let us define the following variables : @xmath44 is the mandelstam variable ; @xmath28 is @xmath25-meson velocity in the @xmath5 pair center of mass system ( for brevity instead of @xmath45 we will write @xmath46 ) ; finally @xmath47 is the angle between the momenta of the initial neutrino and photon in the coordinate system where the center of mass of the produced @xmath5-pair is at rest ( and where the integration of their phase space is straightforward ) : @xmath48    after all these preliminaries we can present the double differential cross section : @xmath49- \\nonumber \\\\ & -&\\frac{s(s - q^2)}{(q^2 + q^2)}(1+\\cos\\gamma ) +   \\label{16 } \\\\ & + & \\left .",

    "using these experimental data and approximate formula ( [ 8 ] ) we are able to get restriction on the magnetic moment of a neutrino . at 90% c.l .",
    "we obtain the following bounds on the muon neutrino magnetic moment : @xmath89 from charm ii experimental data , and @xmath90 from ccfr experimental data , which are approximately two orders of magnitude weaker than the bound on @xmath11 obtained from @xmath4-scattering data @xcite .",
    "as it was noted in @xcite the neutrino magnetic moment can depend on @xmath29 in such a way , that it increases for small @xmath91 and can reach at most @xmath92 .",
    "however , from ( [ 3 ] ) we see that the contribution of small @xmath29 into @xmath93 is suppressed as @xmath94 that is why the production of muon pairs do not allow to study @xmath11 at small @xmath29 .",
    "our main result is the observation of rapid increase with the energy of the cross section of the charged lepton pair production in @xmath1-collisions in the case of nonzero neutrino magnetic moment , @xmath95 . here",
    "we will show how this dependence changes to the famous @xmath96 dependence in the case of two charged particles collision @xcite . unlike the magnetic moment case the vertex of the photon emission by a charged particle does not contain the photon momentum @xmath97 .",
    "that is why the factor @xmath98 in the spectrum described by eq.([3 ] ) converts into @xmath52 . the logarithmic factor in ( [ 3 ] )",
    "@xmath99 remains , since it comes from the @xmath100 blocks of the diagrams shown in fig.3 which are universal .",
    "the integral over @xmath29 starts to diverge in the infrared .",
    "when @xmath101 is emitted by a massless neutrino , the values of @xmath29 can reach zero .",
    "however , for the massive electron @xmath29 minimum is above zero : @xmath102        comparing with the analogous spectrum in the magnetic case given by eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) we see that now one extra log persists . however integrating over @xmath34",
    "we get : @xmath104 and comparing with eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) we note that one log has gone : the double @xmath105 behavior changes to one log .",
    "the last step is the conversion of the cross section of @xmath106 reaction into that of @xmath107 with the help of the equivalent photon ( weiszacker - williams ) approximation : @xmath108 where @xmath109 . in this way",
    "we come to the well - known @xmath110 dependence of the cross section of the lepton pair production in the collision of two charged particles @xcite .    finally , let us note that @xmath111 behavior of the cross section of the reaction @xmath112 is well known in the literature .",
    "in particular , it takes place in the @xmath113 bosons production in the reaction @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "the reason for such a behavior is the absence of power decrease with energy of the @xmath115 cross section ; this behaves like a constant unlike that of @xmath116 cross section which behaves like @xmath117 .",
    "it is evident that the mechanism of the @xmath111 behavior studied in our paper is completely different and arises from the photon emission by a neutrino magnetic moment .",
