    "one of the main sources of gravitational waves for the planned space - borne laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) are quasi - monochromatic galactic binary systems .",
    "the lisa detector is composed of three spacecraft which form an equatorial triangle and will work in the frequency range @xmath3 .",
    "the center of mass of the constellation traces out a circular orbit around the sun at a distance of 1 au and lies about @xmath4 behind the earth .",
    "the three spacecraft cartwheel in retrograde motion as they move around the sun with a period of one year .",
    "this motion induces amplitude , frequency and phase modulations in the gravitational wave signal@xcite .",
    "the amplitude modulation is caused by the antenna pattern being moved across the sky . with the three arms , lisa acts like a pair of two - arm detectors .",
    "the constellation is set up such that the arm lengths of the detector are equal with an angle of @xmath5 between each detector arm .",
    "this is equivalent to the response of two @xmath6 interferometers rotated by an angle of @xmath7 radians with respect to each other . because lisa can be thought of as two separate detectors , measuring different polarizations of the gw , the phase modulations are cause by combinations of the polarizations .",
    "finally , the frequency or doppler modulations are caused by the motion of the detector with respect to the source .",
    "the noise in the lisa detector is complicated by the inclusion of a transfer function at high frequencies . due to this",
    ", we will work , in this study , in the low frequency approximation ( lfa ) . in the lfa we can set the transfer function due to the arm length of the detector equal to unity for @xmath8 hz .    in order to detect galactic binaries",
    "one can employ the method of matched filtering  @xcite .",
    "briefly , the method works as follows : firstly , one creates a set of waveforms , or templates as they are called , that depend on a number of parameters of the source and its location and orientation relative to the detector .",
    "these templates are then cross - correlated with the detector output weighted by the inverse of the noise spectral density . if a signal , whose parameters are close to one of the template waveforms , is actually present in the detector output then the cross - correlation builds up , with the dominant contribution coming from frequencies where the noise spectral density is low .",
    "thus , in the presence of a sufficiently strong signal the correlation will be much larger than the rms correlation in the absence of any signal . how large should it be before we can be confident about the presence of a signal depends on the combination of the number of sources and the false alarm probability .",
    "the effectiveness of matched filtering depends on how well the phase evolution of the waveform is known .",
    "even tiny instantaneous differences , as low as one part in @xmath9 in the phase of the true signal that might be present in the detector output and the template that is used to dig it out could lead to a cumulative difference of several radians since one integrates over several hundreds to several thousands of cycles .    using a geometric method  @xcite , we can treat the parameters of the systems as a set of basis coordinates .",
    "we can then define a scalar product and metric tensor in this vector space .",
    "having done this we can show that we only need to carry out our search over a lower dimensional sub - space .",
    "the search for galactic binaries will then involve the placement of a grid of templates in this sub - space .",
    "the strain of the gravitational wave with both polarizations is h(t ) = + , where the two polarizations are given by h_+(t ) = a_0(1+^2)((t)-_0 ) , h_(t ) = -2a_0((t)-_0 ) , where @xmath10 is a constant initial amplitude , @xmath11 the angle of inclination of the source , and @xmath12 is a constant initial phase .",
    "the phase of the gravitational wave , @xmath13 , for a circular orbit is defined by ( t ) = 2f_0 t + t^2 + 2(f_0+t)r()(2f_mt- ) , where @xmath14 is the quasi - monochromatic frequency and @xmath15 is its first time derivative given by @xmath16 here , @xmath17 , is the chirp mass , and , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the total mass and reduced mass ratio .",
    "( @xmath20 ) define the location of the source , @xmath21 is the modulation frequency and @xmath22 is the number of seconds in a year , and @xmath23 is the light travel time for 1 au ( @xmath24 500 secs ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath25 and @xmath26 are defined in the lfa by  @xcite f^+(t ; , , , ) = , f^(t ; , , , ) = , where @xmath27 is the polarization angle of the wave and @xmath28 or @xmath29 defines the two - arm combination of lisa from which the strain is coming .",
    "the detector pattern functions are given by d^+(t ) = d^(t ) = , where @xmath30 is the orbital phase of the center of mass of the constellation .",
    "the set of @xmath31 parameters which define the system can also be thought of as defining an @xmath31 dimensional manifold .",
    "this template manifold shares the properties of a hilbert space . on this manifold",
    "is it possible to define a scalar product of the two time series waveforms @xmath32 and @xmath33 as @xmath34 where the tilde denotes the fourier transform @xmath35 of the time series waveform @xmath32 , a * denotes complex conjugate and the _ c_.c . denotes a complex conjugate term .",
    "the quantity @xmath36 represents the two - sided noise spectral density of the detector , which is given by  @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the position and acceleration noise respectively . as we are searching for monochromatic binaries",
    ", we can greatly simplify the calculation of the inner product . in this case , the noise at the quasi - monochromatic frequency can be treated as a constant and taken outside the integral .",
    "then , due to parseval s theorem , we can calculate the scalar product in the time domain .",
    "this simplifies equation  ( [ eq : sp ] ) to @xmath40 where @xmath22 is the period of integration ( which in this study we will assume to be @xmath22 = 1 year ) .",
    "if we consider unnormalized waveforms , we can write the metric tensor on this manifold in the form @xmath41 the first term on the right hand side is recognized as being the fisher information matrix .",
    "the extra term on the right hand side arises from the fact that we have not pre - normalized the waveforms .",
    "the number of templates needed to carry out a gravitational wave search is simply the proper volume of the parameter space , divided by the proper volume of the template . assuming a d - dimensional hyper - cubic template , the number of templates is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the determinant of the metric tensor , @xmath44 is the parameter set which defines the manifold and @xmath45 is the proper volume of the template .",
    "while the galactic binaries are defined by an 8-d parameter set , we only need to search over four intrinsic parameters .",
    "the reason for this will be explained in the next section . in order to do this",
    ", we project from the initial 8-d space to the 4-d search sub - space using the recursive projection @xmath46 which carries out a projection onto the sub - space orthogonal to the @xmath47-dimension .",
    "it can be shown that this projection onto orthogonal sub - spaces is equivalent to maximizing over the projected parameter  @xcite .",
    "using the fact that the proper distance between two templates is related to a pre - determined threshold , called a minimum match , @xmath48,via @xmath49 we can now write the proper volume of the template in @xmath50 dimensional space as @xmath51",
    "for numerical purposes it simplifies things if we use the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 . for quasi - monochromatic binaries ,",
    "the initial parameter space is defined by the set @xmath54 .",
    "the first four of these parameters are kinematic or extrinsic parameters .",
    "the four parameters @xmath55 are dynamical parameters dependent on the astrophysical system in question and are called intrinsic parameters ( the parameters @xmath56 are considered intrinsic due to the motion of the detector with respect to the source ) .    instead of having to search over the full 8-d search space , we only need to search of the sub - set of intrinsic parameters @xmath57 .",
    "this is due to the fact that we can use the f - statistic to find the optimal values of the four extrinsic parameters .",
    "this is done as follows .",
    "we first write the strain of the gravitational wave in the form @xmath58 we then define four constants @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the signal , and find a solution for the @xmath61 s in the form @xmath62 where @xmath63 if we now substitute the above into the expression for the reduced log - likelihood , i.e. @xmath64 we obtain the f - statistic  @xcite @xmath65 which automatically maximizes the log - likelihood over the extrinsic parameters and reduces the search space to the sub - space of intrinsic parameters .    in calculating the number of templates needed , we take different limits of the parameter @xmath66 , we set a maximum value of @xmath67 corresponding to a maximum chirp mass of @xmath68 ( giving us a distribution of sample values of @xmath67 for each value of @xmath66 ) and use these as a bounding box for a monte carlo integration to calculate the proper volume of the search manifold . as",
    "the boundary of our search space is quite regular , we can approximate the proper volume of the search space as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the volume of the search space , @xmath71 is the value of the metric determinant at a particular point , and @xmath72 is the total number of points used .",
    "we can see from figure  ( [ fig : pvsq ] ) that choosing a maximum value of @xmath73 for each @xmath66 provides us with a range of values to sample over during the monte carlo integration . at the same time as carrying out the monte carlo integration",
    ", we also compare the proper distance in the @xmath67-dimension for each value of @xmath66 , i.e. @xmath74 with the proper distance between two templates in the @xmath67-dimension , @xmath75 , as defined by equation  [ eqn : tempdist ] .",
    "it is only when @xmath76 that we need to take this parameter into account and increase the dimensionality of the initial search manifold from 7-d to 8-d .",
    "increasing the dimensionality of the search manifold infers a corresponding increase in the dimensionality of the sub - manifold of intrinsic parameters from 3-d to 4-d .",
    "this increase happens at @xmath77 and we now have @xmath78 .",
    "this transition point is indicated by the dashed line in figure  ( [ fig : pvsq ] ) .    in figure  ( [ fig : lisatemplates ] )",
    "we have plotted the cumulative number of templates , @xmath79 , needed to carry out a matched filtering search for individual quasi - monochromatic galactic binaries up to a particular choice of @xmath14 .",
    "we have assumed a minimal match in this case of @xmath80 .",
    "we can see from the plot that at a frequency of @xmath81 hz , there is a point of inflection and a sudden increase in the growth of template number .",
    "it is because of the increase in dimensionality that we have the sudden increase in the growth of template number .",
    "we should also point out that the position of the change of dimensionality is dependent on our choice of @xmath48 .",
    "a higher choice of @xmath48 will push the point corresponding to the change in dimensionality to the left on our graph .    in terms of how the number of templates scales against frequency ,",
    "this increase in dimensionality causes a big change .",
    "below @xmath82 , the number of templates scales as @xmath1 . after the change in dimensionality ,",
    "this changes to @xmath2 .",
    "in this study we have calculated the number of templates needed to carry out the search for individual quasi - monochromatic galactic binaries with the lisa interferometer . using the standard geometric method ,",
    "we have treated the waveform parameters as the basis coordinates in an 8-d space . as most of the parameters are extrinsic to the system",
    ", we only need to carry out the search on a 4-d sub - manifold .",
    "we find that below a frequency of @xmath83 hz , the proper distance between two templates in the @xmath15 direction is greater than the proper coordinate distance in that direction . as a consequence , below this frequency we can completely ignore the parameter defining this direction and our initial search space reduces to 7-d .",
    "it is only above @xmath82 that the proper coordinate distance in that direction becomes equal to or greater than the proper distance between two templates .",
    "we then have an increase in the dimensionality of the search space from 7-d to 8-d .",
    "it is because of this increase in dimensionality that we have the increase in the scaling law from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
