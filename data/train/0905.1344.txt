    "many solutions to the hierarchy problem require new particles whose loop corrections to the higgs mass - squared cancel the quadratically divergent standard model ( sm ) loop corrections .",
    "the masses of the new particles ( especially the particle or particles which cancel the sm top loop ) should be sufficiently small that the higgs mass can be naturally below the tev scale .",
    "on the other hand , if the new particles have masses below @xmath7 then lep observables will be strongly affected if they are exchanged at tree level or can be singly produced .",
    "both these latter possibilities are automatically removed if there is a symmetry under which the new particles are odd and the sm particles are even . in particular",
    ", the new particles can then only contribute to the electroweak observables at the loop level , and new particles with masses of order a few hundreds of gev can be compatible with the data .",
    "in such scenarios the lightest of the new particles is automatically stable and it should be neutral for consistency with bounds on new charged stable matter .",
    "typically , it is also weakly interacting .",
    "such a weakly interaction massive stable particle ( wimp ) will be invisible , leading to `` missing energy '' in particle detectors .",
    "this scenario is also highly desirable since such a wimp can readily provide the dark matter known to be present in the universe .",
    "almost all the models with dark matter candidates also contain additional particles that are charged not only under the new symmetry but also carry sm `` charges , '' most often including color . at a collider , these new particles must ( and will ) be pair - produced , and since they are heavier than the dark matter particle , they will cascade decay down to it . in many cases",
    ", this cascade radiates sm particles in a series of @xmath8 , @xmath9 decays , in which @xmath10 and @xmath11 are new physics particles while @xmath12 is a sm particle .",
    "( in some cases , phase space restrictions force one of the new particles off - shell and @xmath13 , @xmath14 decays are relevant . )",
    "since the final step in the chain will yield a dark matter particle , the typical collider signals for such a scenario will be jets and/or leptons plus missing energy .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is the most popular model of this type . in susy",
    ", the new symmetry is termed matter parity ( sometimes called @xmath15-parity ) .",
    "its conservation implies that the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is stable . in most supersymmetric models",
    "the lsp is the lightest neutralino , which is a good dark matter candidate .",
    "it appears at the end of every supersymmetric particle decay chain and escapes the detector .",
    "all supersymmetric particles are produced in pairs , resulting in at least two missing particles in each event .",
    "other theories of tev scale physics with dark matter candidates have been recently proposed .",
    "they have experimental signatures very similar to susy : _",
    "i.e. _ multi leptons and/or jets plus missing energy .",
    "for instance , universal extra dimensions ( ueds )  @xcite , little higgs theories with @xmath16-parity ( lht )  @xcite , and warped extra dimensions with a @xmath17 parity  @xcite belong to this category of models .",
    "clearly , being able to reconstruct events with missing energy is an important first step to distinguish various scenarios and establish the underlying theory .",
    "in addition , studies  @xcite suggest that the mass of the dark matter particle , and the masses of any other particles with which it can coannihilate , need to be determined to within a few gev in order to be able to compute the dark matter density in the context of a given model .",
    "a very important question is then whether or not the lhc can achieve such accuracy or will it be necessary to wait for threshold scan data from the ilc .",
    "the goal of this paper will be to provide details regarding the kinematic techniques developed in refs .",
    "@xcite that provide the needed accuracy using just lhc data . for the case of 3 visible particles per decay chain , the focus of this paper",
    ", we also show that the kinematic technique gives masses for the bsm particles that are completely insensitive to the particular model by comparing a susy case to a ued case where the decaying bsm and final invisible bsm particles in the two cases have the same masses .",
    "this implies that it is unnecessary to determine the overall mass scale of the bsm particles using model - dependent information , such as total cross sections . indeed , to fully test a potential model",
    ", it is _ necessary _ to first determine the masses of the produced particles just based on kinematic information .",
    "once the masses are known , there are many chain decay configurations for which it will be possible to determine the four - momenta of all the particles on an event - by - event basis .",
    "the four - momenta can then be employed in computing the matrix element squared for different possible spin assignments . in this way , a spin determination may be possible which , in combination with cross section information , can be used to distinguish different models .    in recent years",
    "there have been numerous studies in the context of susy - like theories of how to measure the super - partner masses just based on kinematic information  . in some cases",
    "the procedures employ a single long decay chain of super - particles , usually requiring 3 or more visible particles in the decay chain in order to have enough invariant mass combinations of the visible particles to achieve sensitivity to the absolute mass scale , as opposed to simply mass differences .",
    "squark decay , fig .",
    "[ fig : chain_decay ] , is an example of one such chain .     a decay chain in susy .",
    "]    our approach has been to pursue alternative procedures that employ events in which a pair of identical ( particle and antiparticle , _",
    "e.g. _ squark plus anti - squark ) bsm particles is produced and both decay in the same manner .",
    "in such an event , information from both decay chains in the event can be included at once . in our first paper @xcite",
    ", we tackled the difficult case where we assumed that only two particles appeared in each chain decay , _",
    "e.g. _ making use only of the leptons appearing in fig .",
    "[ fig : chain_decay ] . in this case",
    ", kinematic constraints alone can not give a discrete solution for the unknown masses .",
    "nonetheless , the space of the allowed solutions does contain enough information about the new particle masses and they can be extracted using a statistical procedure  @xcite",
    ". the mass determination can be further improved by combining with other kinematic variables such as @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "however , these kind of analyzes usually require large statistics in order to achieve a reasonable precision . in this paper , we provide details on the case where 3 visible particles are present in each chain decay . in this case , a single pair of events provides enough information to yield a discrete set of possible masses .",
    "therefore , very few events are needed for a rough determination of the masses , in contrast to the statistical methods which rely on the availability of a large number of events .    the general topology on which we focus is then that of fig .",
    "[ fig : topology ] .",
    "the event topology we consider . ]    after including combinatorics and resolution , we will achieve root - mean - square ( rms ) accuracies on the three underlying masses in the decay chain of order a few gev ( depending upon the number of available events ) with a systematic shift that can be easily corrected for .",

    "@xcite , but is included in the present article for completeness and to simplify some of the discussions .",
    "to begin , it is useful to perform a general counting of observables and constraints for various different configurations .",
    "we consider first the counting when only one decay chain in the event is considered at a time .",
    "we then show the increase in constraints possible if both decay chains in each event are considered at once .",
    "we begin with the chain decay @xmath23 , where the 4-momenta of the sm - particles @xmath24 and @xmath25 are directly measured . for each event , there are four unknowns due to the unobserved 4-momentum of the @xmath4 . in addition , we have the three unknown masses ( the same for every event ) @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "these are subject to @xmath29 constraints coming from requiring that the @xmath22 , @xmath21 , and @xmath4 be on their mass - shell .",
    "thus , after @xmath30 events we have @xmath31 free parameters .",
    "no matter how many events we examine , we will not be able to obtain a discrete solution ( or set of solutions ) for @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .    next ,",
    "consider a decay chain with three observable sm particles : @xmath32 . in this case , the number of unknowns after @xmath30 events is @xmath33 and the number of constraints is @xmath34 ( the @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath4 masses , which are the same for every event ) .",
    "after @xmath30 events we then have @xmath35 free parameters , which basically correspond to the 4 unknown masses of the decaying particles . in this case , each event will determine a region in the @xmath36 mass space and , as more events are accumulated , in an ideal world the region of mass space consistent with all events would become more and more restricted , but it will never reach a discrete point ( or a set of discrete points ) with any number of events . to pin down the actual mass point , one needs to use additional information by examining the end points of certain kinematic distributions .",
    "if one considers ( as in @xcite ) a chain with four fully measured sm - particles , @xmath37 , then we have 5 on - shell particles , and after @xmath30 events , we end up with @xmath38 unknowns and @xmath39 constraints .",
    "the number of free parameters is then @xmath40 , implying that ( up to discrete ambiguities associated with a high order polynomial and ignoring combinatorics and resolution ) @xmath41 events would be sufficient to solve for the resonance masses .",
    "however , combinatorics and resolution effects will considerably complicate the situation , as already apparent from the study of @xcite , where they assume that @xmath27 , @xmath26 and @xmath28 are known , leaving , in principle , @xmath42 unknowns and @xmath39 constraints after @xmath30 events , implying that only @xmath43 events would be needed to solve for the remaining @xmath44 masses , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . after including combinatorics and resolution , ref .",
    "@xcite needed many more than 2 events in order to get a mass determination .",
    "the general counting procedure is apparent .",
    "if the decay chain has @xmath47 on - shell decaying particles and a final invisible particle , then after @xmath30 events there will be @xmath34 unknowns associated with the 4-momenta of the invisible particle .",
    "there will also be @xmath48 unknowns corresponding to the unknown masses of all the bsm particles .",
    "these unknowns will be subject to @xmath49 constraints from the requirement that all the bsm particles have the same on - shell masses in each event",
    ". the number of unknowns after @xmath30 signal events will then be n_u = n_a+4n - n_an = n_a+(4-n_a)n . for @xmath50 , a discrete solution or set of solutions",
    "is not possible regardless of how many events are available .",
    "the actual masses may still be obtained by combining additional information from the kinematic distributions for @xmath51 (  the squark decay case of fig .",
    "[ fig : chain_decay ] ) . for @xmath52 (  the susy @xmath53 decay chain )",
    "@xmath41 events will give a discrete set of solutions for the masses .",
    "still longer decay chains would require fewer events to obtain a set of discrete possibilities for the bsm particle masses .",
    "an example of a longer decay chain with @xmath54 ( implying that 3 events would give a discrete set of solutions for the masses ) would be gqqqqqqz qqzlqqzll , [ longchain ] where the @xmath20 would be observed in one of its visible decay modes . by considering the full event at once through inclusion of information from both decay chains , one need not resort to such long decay chains in order to get to the point of having a discrete set of solutions for the masses .",
    "when considering the whole event at once , the constraint counting proceeds differently . assuming that there are two invisible particles present in the final state , the number of unknowns associated with their 4-momenta in all @xmath30 events is @xmath55 . requiring that the sum of the invisible transverse momenta equal minus the sum of the visible transverse momenta imposes @xmath56 constraints on these unknowns .",
    "in addition , let us suppose that the topology is such that @xmath57 masses are unknown ( @xmath57 includes the unknown masses of the invisible particles , which we do not require to be the same at this point in our counting ) .",
    "each event will also be subject to a number @xmath48 of on - shell mass constraints , including the requirement that the two invisible particles have masses equal to their on - shell ( unknown ) values .",
    "then , after @xmath30 events there are @xmath49 constraints .",
    "thus , the number of unknowns before imposing constraints is @xmath58 and the number of constraints is @xmath49 , leaving n_u = n_b+(6-n_a)n unknowns .",
    "if we consider an event with @xmath59 on - shell decays and require that there be no unknowns , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath60 , after @xmath61 events , we find n_s .",
    "of course , in general @xmath62 . for symmetric chains , @xmath63 . for chains in which only the final missing particles are assumed to have the same mass , @xmath64 .",
    "the particular case we focus on in this paper , fig .",
    "[ fig : topology ] , corresponds @xmath65 and @xmath66 . in this case",
    ", @xmath67 events will lead to @xmath68 , implying a discrete set of solutions for the unknown masses of @xmath69 .",
    "were we to consider the case of two identical chains with only 2 visible particles in each and unknown masses for @xmath70 , one would have @xmath54 and @xmath71 , leading to @xmath72 ( corresponding to the unknown @xmath70 masses ) .",
    "this is the case considered in @xcite ; a discrete set of solutions will never emerge with any finite number of signal events .",
    "additional information from kinematic distributions is needed to pin down the masses .",
    "conversely , if one goes to symmetric longer decay chains ( such as that of eq .",
    "( [ longchain ] ) ) with @xmath73 and @xmath74 , then just one event will be sufficient to give a discrete set of mass solutions .",
    "the general problem with longer decay chains is that they are less likely to occur and harder to identify even if they occur , as the visible particles may be lost or hard to isolate .",
    "the shortest decay chains that can give rise to discrete solutions , , the topology of fig .",
    "[ fig : topology ] , with @xmath65 and @xmath66 yielding @xmath67 , is likely to be the optimal configuration for the mass determination .",
    "extension to more missing particles , or quadratic constraints is straightforward , but increases the order of the equations to be solved , requiring more advanced polynomial solvers .",
    "it also requires that more masses be specified .",
    "for example , let us assume some definite topology for which each event contains 3 ` missing ' particles . if we do not presume any mass equalities among the total number , @xmath48 , of decaying resonances and missing particles , then the number of unknowns after @xmath30 events is @xmath75 , where the @xmath76 is the transverse momentum constraint setting the visible transverse momentum equal to minus the invisible transverse momentum in each event and the @xmath77 just corresponds to the 4 unknown components of each of the 3 invisible particles 4-momenta .",
    "the number of mass - shell constraints is ( by definition ) @xmath49 .",
    "if the topology is such that @xmath78 on - shell masses can be reconstructed from the visible momenta and the invisible momenta and if only @xmath57 of the @xmath48 masses are independent , then the number of unknowns after @xmath30 events is @xmath79 and the number of constraints is @xmath49 .",
    "again neglecting possible relations among these masses and requiring the final number of unknowns , @xmath80 , to be 0 or negative in order to have fewer unknowns than constraints after @xmath81 events , one finds that n_s events would lead to a certain set of discrete mass solutions",
    ". if all the invisible particles are the same then @xmath82 .",
    "we have classified many possible decay chains which fall into a category such that a small handful of events could give an essentially unique mass spectrum in the absence of combinatorial and experimental resolution effects .",
    "however , generically speaking one wishes to keep the chains as short as possible while consistent with a small number of events being sufficient to yield a discrete spectrum of mass solutions .",
    "this is because ( a )  shorter chains are easier to isolate on an event - by - event basis and ( b )  combinatorial and resolution smearing of the solutions may be lessened .",
    "the topology on which we focus in this paper is that given in fig .",
    "[ fig : topology ] .",
    "as sketched in the previous section , this is an ideal topology for precise mass reconstruction .",
    "assuming @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and denoting the 4-momenta for particles @xmath87 with @xmath88 , we have @xmath89 we assume further that the only invisible particles are particles @xmath90 and @xmath44 , and thus have two more constraints , @xmath91 there are 8 unknowns in eqs .",
    "( [ mass_shell ] ) through ( [ misspt ] ) , namely , the 4-momenta @xmath92 and @xmath93 of the missing particles .",
    "therefore the system is underconstrained and we can not solve the equations .",
    "this situation changes if we add a second event with the same decay chains . denoting the 4-momenta in the second events as @xmath94 @xmath95",
    ", we have 8 more unknowns , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , but 10 more equations , @xmath98 altogether , we have 16 unknowns and 16 equations . the system can be solved numerically and we obtain discrete solutions for @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 and thus the masses @xmath28 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath46 .",
    "note that the equations always have 8 complex solutions , but we will keep only the real and positive - energy ones which we simply call `` solutions '' in the rest of the paper .",
    "thus , up to a certain number of discrete ambiguities we can determine the @xmath69 masses by pairing any two signal events .",
    "even a few pairs of events are typically sufficient to eliminate the discrete ambiguities due to higher order equations .",
    "however , effects such as wrong combinations and solutions , initial and final state radiation , experimental resolutions , and background events will add complications , which we address in sec .  [",
    "sec : applications ] .    the equations ( [ mass_shell ] ) through ( [ misspt2 ] ) can be easily reduced to 3 quadratic equations plus 13 linear equations , @xmath99 where all but the first line are linear equations because @xmath100 and @xmath101 are all visible measured momenta . in general , the above equation system has 8 complex solutions , each of which could be real .",
    "this can be shown by calculating the grbner basis @xcite , in which the system is transformed to an 8th order univariate equation plus 15 linear equations .",
    "since the other 15 equations are linear , it is straightforward to solve for the other 15 variables once the 8th order equation is solved .",
    "commercial software such as mathematica uses this method .",
    "however , it consumes an intolerably long time for a single or small number of pcs",
    ". we take a simpler and faster approach which is described in detail in the appendices . in our method , instead of ending up with an 8th order equation , we obtain a 9th order univariate polynomial equation and therefore introduce a fake solution in addition to the true solutions . the 9th order univariate polynomial equation is numerically solved using algorithm toms/493 @xcite .",
    "the fake solution can be easily eliminated by substituting back all solutions in the original equations .",

    "for example , one could try to group objects into two hemispheres @xcite and assume that the objects in the same hemisphere come from the same decay chain .",
    "however , this only works well when the initial particles are substantially boosted , while the squarks in our case are produced mostly close to the threshold without large boosts . for small boosts ,",
    "the quark and @xmath105 from squark decay actually belong to two opposite hemispheres instead of the same one .",
    "the directions of the subsequent @xmath105 and @xmath190 decay products are even more random .",
    "we have applied the hemisphere method on a set of ideal events from squark pair production , each containing 2 quarks and 4 leptons according to the decay chain in fig .",
    "[ fig : chain_decay ] . even without any complications from extra jets , experimental smearing and so forth , only about 12% of the events have the decay chains correctly identified ( this does not account for the ambiguity of the two leptons in the same decay chain ) .",
    "one could explore the effectiveness of imposing a cut which accepts only events with substantial thrust or small circularity before separating each event into two hemispheres .",
    "it is not clear to us that the gain from decreasing the combinatorics problem would outweigh the reduced statistics associated with the fact that such a cut would remove a large fraction of the available events .",
    "however , we _ have _ shown that when a two - particle mass edge ( such as the dilepton mass edge in the examples we have considered ) can be identified , it is very useful to impose a cut whereby only solutions that give a dilepton mass within roughly @xmath191 of the edge location are retained . by applying this cut before proceeding with the rest of our analysis procedure the mass peak biases are essentially eliminated and the errors on the central mass values are very similar .",
    "in addition , we have shown that this cut is capable of essentially eliminating contamination of the mass determinations for the susy signal of interest by events coming from some other susy signal that does not share the same dilepton edge location .",
    "presumably any other recognizable kinematic edge could be exploited in similar fashion , but dilepton mass edges will typically be least impacted by detector momentum smearing .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have proposed a kinematic technique for mass determination in events with two invisible dark matter particles .",
    "the technique seeks constraints on the mass space from measured momenta . in sec .",
    "[ sec : counting ] , we have given general constraint counting and discuss the corresponding strategies for both the single decay chain case and the double decay chain case . in the former , one only uses the information from one of the two decay chains in each event ; in the latter , one uses information associated with both decay chains .",
    "the constraints include the mass - shell constraints for the dark matter particle as well as all intermediate particles . in the double decay chain case",
    ", we obtain extra constraints from the measured missing transverse momenta . in both cases ,",
    "more constraints are available when the decay chain is longer . in certain instances (",
    "this includes the single decay chain case with 3 visible particles per chain and the double identical decay chain case with 2 visible particles per chain ) , we obtain discrete solutions for the missing momenta by using trial masses for the unknown particles . requiring that we obtain physical solutions for the momenta ,",
    "the consistent mass region becomes more restricted when more events are included .",
    "the actual masses are obtained by studying the kinematic distributions of the consistent region .",
    "this is the strategy we adopted in refs .",
    "when the decay chains present in each event are longer , it is possible to obtain discrete solutions for the momenta ( and therefore the masses ) by combining the constraints from a few different events , _ without _ assuming any trial masses .",
    "this occurs when there are 4 or more visible particles per decay chain for the single chain case , or 3 or more visible particles per decay chain for the double chain case . in this article",
    ", we have focused on the double identical chain case with the number of visible particles per chain fixed to 3 .    in our case ,",
    "the constraints can be solved for discrete solutions of the unknown masses when two events are combined . however , because the system of equations contains quadratic equations , wrong solutions are introduced . nonetheless ,",
    "if the visible momenta could be measured without errors , it would take only three events to obtain the correct masses .",
    "this is because the wrong solutions would be different for the three different possible event pairings whereas the correct solution remains the same for every event pair .",
    "this remains true even when wrong combinations are included .",
    "however , in practice the non - zero experimental resolutions imply that the correct solution distribution becomes smeared which then overlaps with the distribution coming from wrong solutions , wrong combinations and background events . despite this",
    ", we have shown that when two of the visible particles in a decay chain are leptons , we obtain good precision ( @xmath192 a few gev ) if a few hundred events are available .",
    "we have developed methods to reduce the number of wrong combinations and backgrounds .",
    "the resulting mass solution distributions are clearly peaked around the input masses with small systematic errors which can be eliminated either by comparing with monte carlo distributions around the estimated masses or by imposing an initial dilepton edge mass cut on the accepted solutions .",
    "an important assumption for doing this comparison is that the distributions are only sensitive to the masses instead of the underlying theories .",
    "we have shown that this is indeed the case by comparing two distinct theories with different spin structure , mssm and ued .",
    "we have set the spectra of the two models to be the same and examined the mass distributions , which show little difference .",
    "correspondingly , the systematic errors introduced by model dependence are much smaller than the statistical errors .",
    "finally , we comment on possible improvements of our method . given",
    "the precision of the purely kinematic results and availability of spin determination techniques @xcite it would certainly be possible to figure out the underlying theory / spins and then apply model - dependent techniques to refine the mass determinations .",
    "for example , one could adopt a likelihood method similar to the one used in the top mass measurement with dilepton events at tevatron @xcite . in this method , a probability density , as a function of all unknown masses , is defined for each event by convoluting matrix elements and detector resolution functions .",
    "one then obtains the joint probability by taking the product of the probability densities from all events .",
    "the best - fit masses are given by the values that maximize the joint probability .",
    "compared with top quark mass measurement , the event topology considered in this paper is more complicated since that more final state particles are involved .",
    "one also needs to scan a four dimensional instead of one dimensional mass space to minimize the probability function .",
    "therefore , another benefit of the purely kinematic method is that it significantly simplify the computation by reducing the candidate mass space to a very small region",
    ".    we could also consider simplified likelihood methods using the detector resolution functions , but without the knowledge of the matrix element .",
    "one such method is based on the same constraints , eqs .",
    "( [ mass_shell ] ) through ( [ misspt ] ) , which can be viewed as a generalization of the method discussed in this paper : for each event , we can eliminate the 4-momenta of the two missing particles by using eqs .",
    "( [ mass_shell])-([misspt ] ) .",
    "we are then left with two equations in the form @xmath193 where @xmath194 and @xmath195 are functions of the masses and all visible momenta , @xmath196 .",
    "if we require that the equalities hold exactly , then each event defines a 2-dimensional surface in a 4-dimensional mass space .",
    "the 2-dimensional surfaces of two different events intersect at discrete points , which are nothing but the mass solutions .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that in the mass space , for each event we assign a non - zero probability density for points on the surface and a zero probability density for points off the surface .",
    "then by combining two events , the joint probability is non - zero only at discrete points .",
    "obviously , a more sophisticated method is to assign a maximum probability density for points on the surface , and smaller but non - zero probability densities for points away from the surface .",
    "this can be done by calculating the @xmath197 distribution for each point in the mass space , @xmath198 where @xmath199 and a similar formula holds for @xmath200 . here , we have assumed gaussian distributions for the invisible momenta @xmath196 with errors given by @xmath201 , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : error ] ) can be complicated by correlations among the visible momenta .",
    "we then sum the @xmath197 over all events and obtain the masses when the total @xmath197 is minimized . in practice , @xmath194 and @xmath195 are very complicated functions of the visible momenta , which may result in large roundoff errors .",
    "as in the matrix element method , one also needs to efficiently minimize the @xmath197 over a 4-dimensional space .",
    "therefore , it deserves further studies to determine whether this approach can improve the precision of the mass measurement over the simple method discussed in this paper .    in closing",

    "the idea is to reduce the system to a univariate polynomial equation whose coefficients are ( fixed ) functions of the original visible momenta .",

    "<S> we discuss kinematic methods for determining the masses of the particles in events at a hadron collider in which a pair of identical particles is produced with each decaying via a series of on - shell intermediate beyond - the - sm ( bsm ) particles to visible sm particles and an invisible particle ( schematically , @xmath0 with @xmath1 where @xmath2 are visible sm particles or groups of sm particles , @xmath3 are on - shell bsm particles and @xmath4 is invisible ) . </S>",
    "<S> this topology arises in many models including susy processes such as squark and gluino pair production and decay . </S>",
    "<S> we present the detailed procedure for the case of @xmath5 and demonstrate that the masses obtained from the kinematic procedure are independent of the model by comparing susy to ued .    </S>",
