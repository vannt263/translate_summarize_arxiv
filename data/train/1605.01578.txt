    "domination in graphs is a widely researched branch of graph theory , both from a theoretical and algorithmic point of view . in part",
    ", it is due to its applications to several fields where graphs are used to model the relationships between a finite number of objects . in this way , for instance , some concepts from domination in graphs appear in problems involving finding sets of representatives , as well as in facility location problems or in problems in monitoring communication , in electrical networks or in network routing .    the starting point of this work is a question concerning the design of networks on a finite set of nodes @xmath1 whose dominating sets satisfy specific properties .",
    "thus , in this paper we focus our attention on the collection @xmath4 of all the _ inclusionwise minimal vertex dominating sets _ of a graph @xmath2 .",
    "specifically , we are looking for graphs @xmath2 whose collection of vertex dominating sets @xmath4 is equal or close to a given collection @xmath5 of subsets of nodes @xmath6 .",
    "this problem is related to the closed neighborhood realization problem ( see  @xcite ) , that was first proposed by ss under the name of star system problem ( see  @xcite ) , and has been studied by different authors ( see  @xcite ) .",

    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "first , in section  [ sec general ] we recall the properties of vertex dominating sets of graphs that we will use throughout the paper ( subsection  [ domgrafs ] ) ; we present the basic definitions on hypergraphs and domination hypergraphs ( subsection  [ domhypgrafs ] ) ; and we characterize the uniform hypergraphs of maximum size that are domination hypergraphs ( subsection  [ subuniform ] ) .",
