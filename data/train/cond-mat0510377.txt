    "the discovery@xcite in 1986 of high critical - temperature ( high-@xmath15 ) superconductivity in cuprate oxides has revived intensive and extensive studies on strong electron correlations because it occurs in the vicinity of the mott - hubbard metal - insulator ( m - i ) transition or crossover .",
    "when no electrons or _ holes _ are doped , cuprates are insulators ; they exhibit antiferromagnetism at low temperatures .",
    "when enough electrons or holes are doped , they become metals ; they exhibit superconductivity at low temperatures .",
    "the m - i transition or crossover and the transition between antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases as a function of doping concentrations are asymmetric between electron - doped and hole - doped cuprates @xcite ; the insulating phase is much wider in electron - doped ones than it is in hole - doped ones , and the nel temperature is relatively higher in electron - doped ones than it is in hole - doped ones .",
    "it is plausible that a relevant theory can explain not only high-@xmath15 superconductivity but also the asymmetry of the m - i transition or crossover and that of the nel temperature .    in 1963 ,",
    "three distinguished theories on electron correlations in a single - band model , which is now called the hubbard model , were published by kanamori , @xcite hubbard , @xcite and gutzwiller . @xcite two theories among them are related with the m - i transition or crossover . according to hubbard s theory , @xcite the band splits into two subbands called the lower and upper hubbard bands . according to gutzwiller s theory , @xcite with the help of the fermi - liquid theory , @xcite a narrow band of quasiparticle appears on the chemical potential ; we call them gutzwiller s band and gutzwiller s quasiparticles",
    ". the combination of the two theories implies that the density of states must be of a three - peak structure , gutzwiller s band between the lower and upper hubbard bands .",
    "this speculation was confirmed in a previous paper .",
    "@xcite the mott - hubbard splitting occurs in both metallic and insulating phases as long as the onsite repulsion @xmath16 is large enough , and gutzwiller s band is responsible for metallic behaviors .",
    "then , we can argue that a metal in the vicinity of the m - i transition can become an insulator only when a gap opens in gutzwiller s band or that it can behave as a _ bad _  metal or an insulator when lifetime widths of gutzwiller s quasiparticles are larger than their bandwidth .    not only hubbard s @xcite and gutzwiller s @xcite theories but also the previous theory@xcite are within the single - site approximation ( ssa ) .",
    "this fact implies that local electron correlations must be responsible for the three - peak structure .",
    "local electron correlations are rigorously considered in ssa that includes all the single - site terms ; such an ssa is rigorous for _ paramagnetic phases with no order parameter _ in infinite dimensions .",
    "@xcite it is reduced to solving the anderson model , @xcite which is one of the simplest effective hamiltonians for the kondo problem .",
    "this approximation is often called the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) . @xcite the kondo problem has been almost settled or almost completely clarified @xcite .",
    "the kondo temperature @xmath2 or @xmath3 is defined as an energy scale of local quantum spin fluctuations , with @xmath4 the boltzmann constant .",
    "gutzwiller s band between the lower and upper hubbard bands corresponds to the so called kondo peak between two sub - peaks ; its bandwidth @xmath5 is about @xmath17 .",
    "one of the most essential physics involved in the kondo problem is that a magnetic moment is quenched by local quantum spin fluctuations so that the ground state is a singlet @xcite or a normal fermi liquid .",
    "@xcite a strongly correlated electron liquid on a lattice is a normal fermi liquid at @xmath18 , where magnetic moments are quantum - mechanically quenched , while it is a nondegenerate fermi liquid at @xmath19 , where magnetic moments are thermally quenched .",
    "local - moment magnetism occurs at @xmath19 , and itinerant - electron one occurs at @xmath20 ; superconductivity can only occur at @xmath21 .",
    "the m - i transition or crossover is related with the crossover between local - moment magnetism and itinerant - electron magnetism .",
    "the coherence of quasiparticles is destroyed by not only thermal fluctuations but also disorder .",
    "when @xmath22 or @xmath23 , with @xmath7 the quasiparticle lifetime width , quasiparticles are never well - defined ; the liquid behaves as a bad metal or an insulator .",
    "when @xmath24 and @xmath25 , on the other hand , they are well - defined ; the liquid behaves as a metal .",
    "disorder can also play a significant role in the m - i transition or crossover .",
    "kondo - lattice theories @xcite have been developed so far mainly in order to elucidate strong electron correlations in typical or canonical kondo lattices of lanthanide and actinide alloys , which are also called dense kondo systems or heavy - fermion systems . in these canonical kondo lattices ,",
    "almost localized @xmath26 or @xmath27 electrons and itinerant conduction electrons coexist and conduction electrons can play an important role not only in the quenching of magnetic moments of almost localized electrons but also in the appearance of an intersite exchange interaction mediated by conduction electrons such as the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) exchange interaction @xcite and the opening of the so called hybridization gaps or pseudogaps . in this paper , we are interested in electron correlations in non - canonical kondo lattices such as transition - metal alloys in the vicinity of the m - i transition or crossover , where the coexistence of almost localized electrons and conduction electrons is absent or it plays no essential role even if it is present .    a kondo - lattice theory developed in this paper is a _ perturbation _ theory starting from a starting or an _ unperturbed _ state constructed in a _ non - perturbative _ method , that is , ssa or dmft ; intersite terms are perturbatively considered in terms of intersite exchange interactions .",
    "this perturbation is nothing but @xmath28 expansion , with @xmath29 being spatial dimensionality .",
    "@xcite it has already been applied to typical issues on electron correlations in non - canonical kondo lattices such as the mott - hubbard m - i transition , @xcite the curie - weiss law of itinerant - electron magnets , @xcite itinerant - electron antiferromagnetism @xcite and ferromagnetism , @xcite and related issues to high-@xmath30 superconductivity , @xcite and so on .",
    "early papers @xcite on a mechanism of @xmath31-wave high-@xmath15 superconductivity can also be regarded within the framework of the kondo - lattice theory .",
    "the interplay between correlations and disorder in a paramagnetic phase is investigated for the hubbard model with the just half filling .",
