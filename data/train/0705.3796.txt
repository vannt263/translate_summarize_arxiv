    "on february 23 , 1987 a supernova , designated sn  1987a , exploded in the lmc .",
    "it has since evolved from a supernova ( sn ) dominated by the emission from the radioactive decay of @xmath0co ( @xmath1  d ) , @xmath2co ( @xmath3  d ) , and @xmath4ti ( @xmath5  yr ) in the ejecta to a supernova remnant ( snr ) whose emission is dominated by the interaction of its blast wave with the immediate surrounding medium .",
    "the circumstellar medium exhibits a complex structure , with the closest and densest feature being an inner equatorial ring ( er ) ( e.g. burrows et al .",
    "1995 ; mccray 2007 , figure 1 ) .",
    "ongoing observations of the sn with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) have revealed spectacular images of `` hot spots '' strung along the er like beads on a necklace , with new `` hot spots '' continuing to appear as the blast wave propagates into the ring ( pun et al .",
    "these `` hot spots '' appear to be fingerlike protrusions , the first er material to be hit by the blast wave ( mccray 2007 ; figure 2 ) .",

    "2004 ) show an overall similar morphology , characterized by similar mean radii and surface brightness distribution .",
    "a multiwavelength comparison of the morphological changes of the er is presented in mccray ( 2007 ; figure 6 ) .",
    "the x - ray emission is thermal emission from the very hot plasma , shock heated to temperatures in excess of @xmath7 k by advancing and reflected shocks generated by the sn blast wave ( park et al . 2007 ;",
    "this volume ) .",
    "the optical emission arises from the gas that is shocked by the blast wave transmitted through the dense knots in the er ( kirshner et al . 2007 ; this volume ; pun et al . 2007 ; this volume ) , and the radio emission is synchrotron radiation from shock - accelerated electrons .",
    "the mid - ir emission comprises line and continuum emission .",
    "the lines originate from the optically bright dense knots , whereas the continuum , which dominates the spectrum , is thermal emission from collisionally - heated dust that is immersed in the x - ray emitting plasma .",
    "this dust was formed in the quiescent outflow of the progenitor star before it exploded .    the interaction of the sn blast wave with the er is causing rapid changes in the morphology and the radiative outputs from the snr across all wavelength regions on a dynamical time scale of about a year . here",
    "we report on the recent ir evolution of snr1987a , and what we can learn from the comparison of the ir and x - ray fluxes on the physical condition of the x - ray emitting plasma and gas - grain interaction in the shocked gas .",
    "the morphological similarity between the x - ray and mid - ir images of sn  1987a suggest that the ir emission arises from dust that is collisionally heated by the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "simple arguments , presented below , show that under certain conditions the ir luminosity and spectrum of a dusty plasma can be used as a diagnostic for the physical conditions of the gas and details of the gas - grain interactions .",
    "details of the arguments can be found in dwek ( 1987 ) and dwek & arendt ( 1992 ) .",
    "we will assume that the dust is primarily heated by electronic collisions with the ambient gas .",
    "the collisional heating rate , @xmath8 of a dust grain of radius @xmath9 embedded in a hot plasma with electron density , @xmath10 and gas temperature , @xmath11 is given by : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the thermal velocity of the electrons , and @xmath14 is the average energy deposited by electronic collisions in the dust . if most electrons are stopped in the dust then @xmath14 is , on average , equal to the thermal energy of the electrons , that is , @xmath15 . on the other hand , if most incident electrons penetrate the grains , then @xmath16 where the electron stopping power in the solid is defined as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the mass density of a grain .",
    "at the energies of interest here the electronic stopping power has an energy dependence of @xmath19 ( iskef et al .",
    "the functional dependence of the grain heating rate on gas density and temperature is then given by :    @xmath20    the radiative cooling rate , @xmath21 , of the dust grain with temperature @xmath22 by ir emission is given by : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , and @xmath25 is the planck - averaged value of the dust emissivity , @xmath26 , where the value of emissivity index , @xmath27 , is @xmath28 .    in equilibrium , @xmath29 , and the dust temperature dependence on plasma density and temperature can be written as : @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "these simple arguments show that when the gas temperature is sufficiently high , and the grain size sufficiently small so that most electrons penetrate the grain , the dust temperature depends only on plasma density .",
    "m  silicate grains as a function of electron density and temperature . above temperatures of @xmath32",
    "k the grains become transparent to the incident electrons , and the dust temperature is only a function of electron density .",
    "we note here that a similar figure ( figure 15 in bouchet et al .",
    "2006 ) was mislabeled , and actually corresponds to contour levels of silicate dust temperature for grain radius of @xmath33  @xmath6m.,width=480 ]    figure [ tempeq ] depicts contour levels of the dust temperature as a function of electron density and temperature for 0.01  @xmath6 m  silicate grains .",
    "the figure shows that above temperatures of @xmath34  k most of the dust particles penetrate the grains and the dust temperature is essentially determined by the electron density . under these conditions ,",
    "the ir spectrum from the collisionally - heated grains becomes an excellent diagnostic of the density of the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ specvol ]      an upper limit on the @xmath35 flux ratio can be obtained by comparing the observed ir flux from snr  1987a to the observed x - ray flux in the 0.20 - 4.0  kev band .",
    "the total ir flux on day 6190 was @xmath36  erg  @xmath37  s@xmath38",
    "( bouchet et al . 2007 ) , comparable to the 0.20 - 4.0  kev x - ray flux of @xmath39  erg  @xmath37  s@xmath38 , giving an @xmath35 value @xmath40 .",
    "the low value of the @xmath35 flux ratio , compared to the expected one of @xmath41 , suggests that the dust is severly depleted compared to standard dust - to - gas mass ratio in the lmc , either because the dust condensation efficiency in the wind of the pre - sn star was very low , or that the dust is being destroyed in the hot x - ray gas .",
    "recent _ spitzer _ observations taken on september 8 , 2006 ( day 7137 since the explosion ) shows that the ir flux has increased by a factor of 2 since day 6190 ( see figure [ specvol ] ) .",
    "the figure shows that the dust composition and temperature remained unchanged during the two observing periods .",
    "these observations provide strong constraints on the interaction of the sn blast wave with the equatorial ring , suggesting that the density of the x - ray emitting gas remained essentially unchanged at @xmath42  @xmath43  between these two epochs .    in comparison ,",
    "the x - rays from the er have increased by a factor of 3 , during the same period ( park et al .",
    "this volume ) .",
    "if grains were not destroyed , we would expect the ir intensity to increase by a similar factor . _ the smaller increase in the ir , e.g. the decline in the @xmath35 ratio , is a strong indicator that we are for the first time witnessing the actual destruction of dust in a shock on a dynamical timescale !",
    "_ grain destruction becomes important on time scales of @xmath441 yr , if the initial radii of the silicate dust grains are smaller than @xmath44 50   ( bouchet et al .",
    "the rapid changes that have been observed in the optical ( _ hubble _ ) , x - ray ( _ chandra _ ) , and mid - ir ( gemini south ) morphology are all manifestations of the interaction of the sn blast wave with the complex structure of the er . the infrared observations provide important complementary information on the evolution of the interaction of the sn blast wave with the er that can not be obtained at any other wavelength . in particular , the mid - ir images have established that the ir emission originates from the interaction of the sn blast wave with the circumstellar material . _",
    "spitzer _ spectral observations on day 6190 after the explosion revealed that the radiating dust consists of silicate dust grains radiating at a temperature of @xmath45  k. subsequent observations on day 7137 revealed that the ir flux increased by a factor of @xmath46 , maintaining the same dust composition and temperature .",
    "these observations constrain the plasma density to be about @xmath42  @xmath43 , and to remain roughly constant during the two epochs of ir observations .",
    "comparison with the x - ray observations over the similar period show that the dust is severely depleted in the x - ray emitting gas , compared to standard lmc abundances , and that the dust is being destroyed on an evolutionary time scale ( @xmath47  yr ) in the shocked gas .",
