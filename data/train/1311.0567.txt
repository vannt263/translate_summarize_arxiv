    "+ [ toc ]    strong electron correlation effects remain a highly relevant topic in the physics and chemistry of carbon - based materials .",
    "extensive experimentation has confirmed strong electron correlation effects in quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) carbon - based systems such as linear @xmath0-conjugated polymers , single - walled carbon nanotubes , graphene nanoribbons , etc .",
    "historically , the study of the excited state ordering in finite polyenes @xcite provided the most convincing evidence for strong electron correlation effects in quasi-1d @xmath0-conjugated systems , and formed the basis of correlated - electron theories in the long chain polyacetylenes and polydiacetylenes . @xcite the early calculations @xcite were within the semiempirical pariser@xmath1parr@xmath1pople ( ppp ) @xmath0-electron model hamiltonian,@xcite within which eigenstates of even polyenes with c@xmath4 point group symmetry have even and odd spatial as well as charge - conjugation symmetries ( ccss ) , and allowed one - photon ( two - photon ) transitions from the @xmath5a@xmath6 ground state are to @xmath7b@xmath8 ( @xmath7a@xmath6 ) states with opposite ( same ) symmetries ( the superscript @xmath9 indicates singlet spin state and the `` plus '' and `` minus '' superscripts refer to ccs ) .",
    "the occurrence of the lowest two - photon state , the 2@xmath7a@xmath6 , _ below _ the one - photon 1@xmath7b@xmath8 in polyenes @xcite is opposite to that expected within the one - electron hckel and mean - field hartree@xmath1fock ( hf ) theories and is a consequence of strong short - range electron@xmath1electron ( e@xmath1e ) interactions within the ppp model.@xcite subsequent to these early model calculations , considerable effort has gone into developing more sophisticated quantum chemical correlated _ ab initio _ approaches to polyene spectra .",
    "quantum chemical approaches that are now able to reproduce the correct one - photon versus two - photon state ordering for short linear polyenes ( usually up to octatetraene ) include the complete active space second order perturbation theory ( caspt2 ) and third - order coupled cluster theory , @xcite and the extended algebraic diagrammatic construction ( adc(2)-x ) method .",
    "@xcite correct excited state ordering is also found within a density functional theory - based multiple reference configuration interaction ( dft - mrci ) approach .",
    "@xcite ccs characteristic of the ppp model is absent within the latter approaches ; however , the violation of ccs is weak .",
    "@xcite importantly , the quantum chemical approaches do find the double excitation character of the 2@xmath7a@xmath10 .",
    "theoretical works have also found reversed excited state ordering in long acenes from pentacene onward , within the ppp model , @xcite a semi - empirical dft - mrci method @xcite and the adc(2)-x approach .",
    "@xcite acenes can be considered as coupled polyene chains and are also quasi-1d .",
    "in contrast to the quasi-1d systems , there have been few , if any , systematic studies of electron correlation effects in two - dimensional ( 2d ) molecules . in this work",
    "we take the first step toward addressing electron correlation effects in 2d molecules by conducting a systematic study of excited states ordering in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) . by performing meticulous experimental and computational analyses of the one- and two - photon excited states for the three pah molecules shown in figure  [ f1]a@xmath1c ,",
    "we find reversed excited state ordering within these 2d molecules in clear contradiction to the description of one - electron theory .",
    "these correlation effects are found to be overall weaker compared to quasi-1d carbon - based systems , due to the larger one - electron bandwidth in 2d .",
    "possible extension of our study to larger molecules can also shed light on electron correlation effects in graphene as a genuine 2d carbon - based system in the thermodynamic limit . within",
    "the hckel tight - binding @xmath0-electron theory graphene is a semimetal , with linear energy versus momentum relationship near the dirac point where the filled valence and empty conduction bands meet .",
    "although many experimental observations appear to be in agreement with this description , @xcite the neglect of the repulsive e@xmath1e interaction between the @xmath0-electrons is increasingly being questioned .",
    "@xcite    h@xmath11 ) ( b ) hexa - peri - hexabenzocoronene , hereafter hbc ( c@xmath12h@xmath13 ) , and ( d ) circumcoronene ( c@xmath14h@xmath13).,width=192 ]",
    "quantum chemical approaches can correctly describe low - lying two - photon states of double excitation character only for relatively small molecules .",
    "@xcite the two larger pah molecules of interest here , namely , hbc and circumcoronene , lie outside the scope of these calculations",
    ". moreover , while we are principally interested in the relative energies of the lowest one- and two - photon states , we will in the following compare experimental and calculated two - photon absorption ( tpa ) spectra over a broad frequency range , which requires that we are able to calculate the energies and wave functions of the higher energy two - photon states .",
    "these requirements restrict us to perform our calculations within the semiempirical ppp hamiltonian , @xcite which is written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 creates a @xmath0-electron of spin @xmath17 on carbon atom @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the number of electrons of spin @xmath17 on atom @xmath18 , and @xmath20 .",
    "the one - electron hopping integral @xmath21 is between nearest neighbor carbon atoms @xmath18 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the hubbard repulsion between two electrons occupying the same atomic @xmath24 orbital , and @xmath25 is the long - range intersite coulomb interaction . we choose standard @xmath26 ev , @xcite and obtain @xmath25 from the parametrization , @xcite @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the distance in @xmath29 between carbon atoms @xmath18 and @xmath22 and @xmath30 is an effective dielectric constant .",
    "we fix carbon@xmath1carbon ( c@xmath1c ) bond lengths to @xmath31 @xmath29 and all bond angles to 120@xmath32 .",
    "the actual bond lengths and angles may deviate slightly from these mean values , but given the aromatic nature of the molecules , we expect these deviations and their effects on the energies of the one- and two - photon states to be small .",
    "this is shown explicitly for coronene ( see appendix ) , the only molecule for which the experimental bond lengths are available in the literature .",
    "we choose @xmath33 ev and @xmath34 based on the excellent fits obtained previously with these parameters for the excited states of poly@xmath1paraphenylenevinylene , @xcite polyacenes , @xcite and single - walled carbon nanotubes .",
    "@xcite    the molecules in figure  [ f1 ] belong to the @xmath2 point group and possess inversion , reflection , 6-fold rotational , and cc symmetries . since @xmath2 is not abelian , in the following we adopt the abelian @xmath35 point group symmetry to partition excited states into distinct one- and two - photon classes .",
    "the ground state is in the @xmath7a@xmath6 subspace for all the molecules of figure  [ f1]a@xmath1c .",
    "dipole selection rules dictate that one - photon ( linear ) absorption ( tpa ) occur only to @xmath7b@xmath36 and @xmath7b@xmath37 ( @xmath7a@xmath6 and @xmath7b@xmath38 ) states with spatial and cc symmetries opposite to ( the same as ) that of the ground state .",
    "in addition pahs also have @xmath7b@xmath39 and @xmath7b@xmath40 states forbidden in both one- and two - photon processes .",
    "our calculations were done using the multiple reference singles and doubles configuration interaction ( mrsdci ) @xcite .",
    "the mrsdci retains the dominant single , double , triple , and quadruple excitations for each targeted state @xcite , with the number of configurations systematically increased until numerical convergence is reached . while excitonic effects due to the correlation between a single electron@xmath1hole pair in optically allowed states have been treated very successfully for graphene @xcite and other carbon nanostructures @xcite within the gw - bethe salpeter technique , application of this first - principles approach to investigate the lowest two - photon eigenstates has not yet been possible . for example , the lowest two - photon states that occur below the optical gap in trans - polyacetylene @xcite is missed within the gw - bethe salpeter approach , @xcite even though the latter gives accurate description of the optical exciton .",
    "thus , the inclusion of ci with multiple electron@xmath1hole excitations is a necessary requirement for obtaining two - photon states below the lowest one - photon optical state .",
    "@xcite the semiempirical approach taken by us can not be easily extended to the thermodynamic limit ( except in one dimension , where the density matrix renormalization group approach can be used @xcite ) , but this disadvantage is offset by the ability to include high order correlation effects , involving triply and quadruply excited configurations with respect to the restricted hartree@xmath1fock ( rhf ) reference state .",
    "next , we describe the procedure involved in performing various levels of ci calculations presented in this work .",
    "the initial step of our ci studies involves determination of the self - consistent rhf solutions of the ppp hamiltonian ( see eq  [ ppp_ham ] ) .",
    "the basis functions of the many - body calculations are configurations with all possible electron occupancies of the hf molecular orbitals ( mos ) .",
    "a full ci calculation involves construction of the hamiltonian matrix with all possible excitations from the hf ground state , and this is the procedure we have followed in the text for octatetraene and decapentaene . for select few cases , quadruple - ci ( qci ) , which incorporates all excitations up to quadruples from the hf ground state , is also possible . with a large number of electrons , as in the present case ,",
    "one then encounters the following problem . on one hand ,",
    "straightforward high - order ci such as the qci is beyond today s computational capability . on the other hand , lower order ci such as double - ci",
    "does not give the correct excited state ordering for large molecules .",
    "it is precisely for such large systems that the mrsdci is used .",
    "@xcite we have previously performed calculations as large as the ones reported here for quasi-1d molecules and oligomers .",
    "@xcite    the mrsdci is performed in two steps . at the first step ,",
    "a few ( @xmath41 ) singly and doubly excited reference configurations that best describe the excited states in the targeted symmetry subspace are selected on the basis of a trial double - ci calculation .",
    "the second step involves the mrsdci calculation , in which the hamiltonian matrix consists of single and double excitations with respect to the original @xmath41 configurations themselves .",
    "the total number of configurations @xmath42 therefore includes also the subset of the dominant triple and quadruple excitations .",
    "the new set of @xmath42 configurations are now examined , single and double excitations from the hf ground states that contribute significantly to the eigenstates within the targeted symmetry subspace are identified , and these are included to augment the new reference space , following which the mrsdci is performed again .",
    "this iterative approach is continued , with updating of @xmath41 and @xmath42 at every step , until convergence to some tolerance determined by the size of the system is reached .",

    "the calculated one - photon energies of the 1@xmath7b@xmath36 and 1@xmath7b@xmath37 give excellent fits to the experimental transition energies of these states in both coronene and hbc .",
    "for the first time , two - photon states below the lowest optically allowed one - photon state are demonstrated in 2d pahs , in complete contradiction to the predictions of the one - electron hckel model .",
    "theoretical determination of subgap two - photon states can be achieved only by taking into account electron correlation effects that are an order higher than the 1e@xmath11h excitonic interactions.@xcite .",
    "our theoretical and experimental works , taken together , indicate that while the consequences of e@xmath1e interactions in the pahs are weaker than in polyenes , these effects are nevertheless significant .",
    "in particular , correlation effects in pahs appear to be stronger than in the phenyl group - containing @xmath0-conjugated quasi-1d polymers poly-(paraphenylene ) and poly-(paraphenylenevinylene ) , in which the 2@xmath7a@xmath6 occurs _ above _ the 1@xmath7b@xmath8 state .",
    "@xcite    in the future we are planning to perform similar theoretical as well as experimental investigations of pah molecules larger than the ones considered here .",
    "such analyses can potentially open up an effective means to determine the effective short - range hubbard @xmath23 in graphene , which as we pointed out in the introduction , remains controversial .",
    "@xmath29 assigned to all c@xmath1c bonds .",
    "( b ) actual bond lengths of coronene , from ref  .",
    "note that @xmath2 symmetry is maintained .",
    "( c ) ground state linear absorption corresponding to ( a ) and ( b ) , performed using the single - ci approximation.,width=336 ]",
    "in our theoretical analyses of e@xmath1e correlation effects , we have used idealized geometries with uniform c@xmath1c bond lengths of @xmath31 @xmath29 and hopping integrals @xmath26 ev . in reality , the c@xmath1c bonds deviate from this idealized length , and these deviations can in principle influence our overall results .",
    "deviations from the idealized geometry are , however , expected to be small for the aromatic molecules in question .",
    "the experimental bond lengths are available only for coronene . here",
    "we demonstrate explicitly for this case that the expected changes in energies due to geometry modifications are negligible , and in no way affects our main conclusion .    in figure  [ f4]a ,",
    "b we have shown the coronene molecule with its idealized uniform bond lengths , and with the actual bond lengths , @xcite respectively . we calculated all hopping integrals from the known bond length@xmath1hopping integral relationship , @xmath147 , @xcite where @xmath148 is the c@xmath1c bond length in  .",
    "the calculated hopping integrals in descending order are @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 ev , respectively .",
    "the @xmath25 were calculated as defined in eq [ ppp_ham ] within the text .",
    "figure  [ f4]c shows the ground state linear absorption within the single - ci for the geometries of figure  [ f4]a , b .",
    "deviation from equal bond lengths blue shifts the main absorption band very weakly ( the energy of the optical state is slightly smaller than what is obtained within the mrsdci , but this is of no concern here ) .",
    "as mentioned above , experimental bond lengths are currently not available for hbc . based on our results for coronene , we believe , however , that it is safe to assume that any deviations in energies due to weak distortions from idealized geometries will not affect our overall qualitative conclusion about the reversed excited state ordering , which can not be obtained without explicit inclusion of strong e@xmath1e interactions , and which is the core theme of our work .",
