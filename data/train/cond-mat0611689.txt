    "the advent of optical lattice confinement of ultracold atomic gases oplat , jaksch , greiner , paredes opens the possibility of observing a vast array of phenomena in quantum condensed systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , optical lattice systems may turn out to be the ideal tools for the analog simulation of various strongly correlated interacting lattice models ( e.g. hubbard model @xcite , kitaev model @xcite ) studied in solid state physics .",
    "the great advantage of optical lattices as analog simulators of strongly correlated hamiltonians lies in the ability of optical lattices to accurately implement lattice models without impurities , defects , lattice phonons and other complications which can obscure the observation of quantum degenerate phenomena in the solid state .    in this context",
    "optical lattices can support a variety of interacting spin models which to date have been only approximately or indirectly observed in nature or remain as rather deep but unobserved mathematical constructs .",
    "three exciting possibilities are currently the subject of active study lewenstein .",
    "the first ( and the most direct ) envisions simulation of conventional condensed matter spin lattice models in optical lattices .",
    "quantum magnetism arising from strong correlation leads to many - body spin ground states that can be characterized by spin order parameters .",
    "spin order can , in some cases , show long range behavior arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking , e.g. ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism .",
    "such long range spin ordering phenomena are reasonably well understood in most cases .",
    "recent work also relates conventional spin order parameters to entanglement measures which yield scaling behavior near quantum phase transitions entang1,entang2 .",
    "the second possibility , simulation of topological spin states , arises from the surprising fact that optical lattices can also ( at least in principle ) host more complicated spin models previously thought to be academic .",
    "the ground states of these models do not fall within the conventional landau paradigm , i.e. there is no spontaneously broken symmetry , but show topological ordering and , as a result , display nontrivial short range behavior in spin correlation functions .",
    "examples include the chiral spin liquid model @xcite and the kitaev model kitaev , duan , zoller , zhang1 . and finally , optical lattices are also particularly well suited to realize coherent and collective spin dynamics because dissipation can be kept to suitably low levels @xcite .    while optical lattices offer the possibility of realizing all three of the above examples one glaring question remains",
    "once a suitable spin hamiltonian is realized , how do we observe the vast array of predicted phenomena in spin - optical lattices ?",
    "to date time of flight measurements have proven to yield detailed information related to two types of important correlation functions of many - body ground states of particles trapped in optical lattices .",
    "the first , a first order correlation function ( the momentum distribution ) , indicates ordering in one - point correlation functions @xcite .",
    "the second is a second order correlation function ( the noise distribution ) which indicates ordering in two - point density - density correlators @xcite .",
    "the former can , for example , detect long range phase coherence while , as we will see below , the latter is best suited to probe long range order in two - point correlation functions , e.g. the lattice spin - spin correlation function .",
    "we note that recent proposals suggest that time of flight imaging can in principle be used to extract other correlation functions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a technique to observe equal time @xmath0-spin correlation functions characterizing _ both _ long and short range spin ordering useful in studying all three classes of spin lattice phenomena mentioned above .",
    "our proposal utilizes realistic experimental techniques involving focused lasers , microwave pulsing and fluorescence detection to effectively measure a general @xmath0-spin correlation function defined by : @xmath1where @xmath2 is the many - body wavefunction of the atomic ensemble , @xmath3 is a set of sites , and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) are pauli spin operators at sites @xmath6 with the notation @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10",

    "can vary adiabatically as a function of time , @xmath16 , while the dimensionless parameters @xmath17 are kept fixed .",
    "for example , @xmath18 represents the usual two - body heisenberg model .",
    "several proposals now exist for simulating two - body heisenberg models lewenstein , duan . in the following we , as an example , consider optical lattice implementations of the heisenberg @xmath19 model : @xmath20 ,   \\label{ham2}\\]]where @xmath21 denotes nearest neighbors and @xmath22 and @xmath15 are model parameters that can be adjusted by , for example , varying the intensity of lattice laser beams @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we show that , in practice , short range spin correlations are difficult to detect in noise correlation measurements .",
    "section iii lays out a general procedure for detecting @xmath0-spin correlations with local probes . an experimental scheme for realizing such a procedure is proposed and a quantitative feasibility analysis is presented .",
    "section iv is devoted to an investigation of the time - dependence of correlation functions using the technique .",
    "in particular , we show how the technique can be used to engineer and probe spin wave dynamics .",
    "we conclude in section v.",
    "we first discuss the measurement of spin - spin correlation functions by analyzing spatial noise correlations ( two point density - density correlations , i.e. @xmath23 in time of flight images from atoms confined to an optical lattice modeled by the @xmath19 hamiltonian .",
    "the ground states of this and a variety of spin models can be characterized by the spin - spin correlation function between different sites .",
    "for instance , the spin - spin correlation function in a one dimensional @xmath19 spin chain ( with @xmath24 ) , shows power - law decay @xmath25 in the critical regime ( @xmath26 ) , where @xmath27 . in principle",
    "this correlation function can be probed by spatial noise correlation in time of flight .",
    "we argue that , in practice , short range correlations ( e.g. @xmath28 in the @xmath29 model ) are difficult to detect in time of flight noise correlation measurements . to see this note that the noise correlation signal is proportional to @xcite : @xmath30where",
    "@xmath31 is the lattice wave vector which gets mapped into coordinates @xmath32 and @xmath33 in time of flight on the detection screen , and @xmath34 is the lattice spacing .",
    "including normalization the noise correlation signal is proportional to @xmath35 for systems with long range order ( e.g. anti - ferromagnetic order giving @xmath36 in the above @xmath19 model ) but shows a much weaker scaling for short range correlations . in fact",
    "the _ ratio _ between correlators in a ground state with @xmath28 ( short range power law order ) and @xmath36 ( long range anti - ferromagnetic order ) scales as @xmath35 making the state with power law correlations relatively difficult to detect in large systems . to illustrate this we compare the calculated noise correlation amplitude , @xmath37 , in fig .",

    "we see that the correlation amplitude for short range ( power - law ) order is extremely small in comparison to long range anti - ferromagnetic order for large @xmath42 .     model .",
    "the solid ( dashed ) line corresponds to a ground state with @xmath43,@xmath44long - range ( @xmath45 , short - range ) spin correlator .",
    "the amplitudes are normalized by the maximum for anti - ferromagnetic order ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the number of atoms in panel a ( b ) is @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) . ]",
    "the small correlation signal originates from the fact that the noise correlation method is in practice a conditional probability measuring collective properties of the whole system , while short range spin correlations describe local properties and are therefore best detected via local operations . in the following",
    "we propose a local probe technique to measure local correlations thus providing an experimental scheme which compliments the time of flight@xmath46noise correlation technique , best suited for detecting long range order .",
    "we find that general @xmath0-spin correlators , @xmath47 , can be related to the stokes parameters broadly defined in terms of the local reduced density matrix @xmath48 on sites @xmath49 , where the trace is taken on all sites except the set @xmath50 .",

    ", we transfer atoms at both sites @xmath224 and @xmath228 to the state @xmath243 and use the same resonant laser to detect the joint probability for atoms at @xmath241 .",
    "the fluorescence signal has three levels , which correspond to both atoms @xmath246 , one atom @xmath247 , and no atoms at state @xmath241 .",
    "a combination of these measurement results gives the spin - spin correlator @xmath248 .",
    "we find that a relation between general spin correlation functions and observable state occupation probabilities in optical lattices allows for quantitative measurements of a variety of spin correlators with the help of local probes , specifically focused lasers and microwave pulsing .",
    "our proposal includes a realistic and practical quantitative analysis suggesting that @xmath0-spin correlations can be probed with an error @xmath181 , which is sufficient to measure both long and short range spin correlation functions .",
    "our work establishes a practical and workable method for detecting @xmath0-spin correlations for cold atoms in one , two or three dimensional optical lattices .",
