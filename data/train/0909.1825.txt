    "in magnetic materials the local magnetic moments ( lmm ) are generally due to the d- and f- electrons .",

    "p - orbitals in 3d - metals are less localized or even delocalized ( _ delocalized region ( dr ) _ ) . thus , there are regions of high spin density ( sd ) in the lr near the nucleus and low sd further away in the dr . despite the inhomogeneity of sd in magnetic materials",
    ", it is frequently described within the quasispin approximation @xcite , according to which the direction of the sd around each atom is taken constant within atomic sphere ( as ) or polyhedron .",
    "this approach works better for the systems with strong spin - exchange coupling because the strong exchange between spins ensures that the sd direction stays almost uniform . yet , for some systems it is essential to consider detailed distribution of magnetization axis as this may reveal additional important features of the magnetic configurations @xcite overlooked within the _ rigid spin approximation _ ( rsa ) . in this paper",
    "we examine the sd distribution of the systems with frustrated magnetization , in particular mn@xmath0an antiperovskites , using fully unconstrained sd functional without any assumption on the uniformity of sd around each atom .",
    "many interesting phenomena in magnetic materials are due to the interplay of magnetic and structural degrees of freedom because the sd is sensitive to mechanical deformations such as compression , in - plane biaxial strain , etc . in particular , such phenomena based on magneto - mechanical coupling have been reported for the mn - based antiperovskites , - for example piezomagnetic effect @xcite , a giant magnetoresistance of more than 10% in pulsed magnetic fields",
    "@xcite , invar effect ( or even negative thermal expansion ) @xcite .",
    "while the sd evolves under mechanical stress , the rsa assumes that its direction is changing uniformly inside of the as .",
    "yet , it is not obvious that in the excited states the spin moments in lr and dr rotate to the same angle .",

    "[ ground - state ] the magnetic moment of the mn1 atom in the basal plane ( formed by atoms of mn and ga ) preserves its direction but its magnitude decreases / increses under compressive / tensile strain .",
    "lmms of the mn2 atoms in the mn@xmath7n plane change both their direction and magnitude , - they rotate towards the [ 110 ] direction when the compressive strain is applied in such a way that they become almost opposite to the lmm of mn1 atom at large strains .",

    "rotate in direction opposite to the one at the compressive strain and the mn2 moments become more anti - aligned .",
    "the magnitude of the lmms generally decreases with the compressive strain and increases with the tensile strain .",
    "thus , mn@xmath8an ( a = ga , zn ) antiperovskite acquires a net magnetization under biaxial strain as a result of the rotation of lmms and change in their magnitude .",

    "particularly , in the lr ( approximately inside r@xmath130.7 sphere ) spin axis direction is more or less uniform .",
    "however , in the dr of low sd ( approximately 0.7@xmath13r@xmath131.4 ) the direction is changing substantially ( by about 30 degrees ) .",
    "even more dramatic effect can be observed under strain , where regions of sd inside as rotate in opposite directions . to better visualize the non - uniformity of sd we plot the vector product of the magnetizations in the ground state and under strain ( * m*(equilibrium)@xmath14**m**(strain ) ) in the ( 111)-plane ( see figure  [ ga - zn - magn - dens ] ) .",

    "as one can see the angle @xmath17 under tensile strain for the sd distribution in the lr is lower than the @xmath17 for the ground state in the same region .",
