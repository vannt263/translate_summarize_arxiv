    "very roughly , here is what we do :    first , properties of @xmath7 are established that combined with results of brion @xcite imply a bound on the degrees in @xmath31 that generalises `` deodhar s inequality '' for degrees in ordinary bruhat graphs of weyl groups .",

    "after a preliminary version of this article was circulated , mcgovern @xcite has applied our results in order to deduce a criterion for ( rational ) smoothness in the case @xmath45 , @xmath8 in terms of pattern avoidance among fixed point free involutions .",
    "moreover , he proved that in this case the rationally singular loci in fact coincide with the singular loci .",
    "_    closures of symmetric orbits are interesting objects in their own right , but another important reason to study their singularities is their impact on representation theory .",
