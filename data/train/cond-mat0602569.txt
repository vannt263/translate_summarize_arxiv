    "orders are often very loosely classified into two types :    ( * i * ) _ global symmetry breaking orders_. in many systems ( e.g. ferromagnets ) , there is an invariance of the basic interactions with respect to global symmetry operations ( e.g.rotations in the case of ferromagnets ) simultaneously performed on all of the fields in the system . at sufficiently low temperatures ( or high coupling ) , such symmetries may often be `` spontaneously '' broken .",
