    "these smbhs will form a smbh binary and finally merge due to emission of gravitational wave @xcite . in the process ,",

    "effects of the smbh binary on a nuclear gas disk are not studied yet and it may be very important for star formation in the galactic center .    since the gravitational potential of a smbh binary has non - axisymmetric component , we expect that gas motion in a nuclear gas disk is strongly influenced by a smbh binary .",

    "duration time of the star bursts is less than @xmath61 yr .",

    "therefore , much gas ca nt be accumulated into the regions around smbhs by the gravity of smbhs and gas disks are hardly formed around smbhs in model 1 .",
    "the massive gas disks and the active star formation around smbhs are the typical features of elliptical orbit case of smbhs .",

    "after several orbital rotations of smbhs , gas disks are also formed around smbhs as in model 2 and 3 as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ result4 ] .",
    "however , after about @xmath69 yr , the gas disks around smbhs are destroyed as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ result4 ] .",
    "this is induced by the strong tidal force due to another smbh , when smbhs are close each other .",
    "the tidal force also affects the orbital angular momentum of each smbh and it may be important for coalescence of smbhs . when the tidal force destroys the disks around smbhs , the destroyed part of gas disks gains the angular momentums from smbhs .",
    "as the result , each smbh loses its orbital angular momentum . in the other models the angular momentums",
    "are not decreased as much as model 4 .",
    "this may be due to the fact that the destruction of disks around smbhs by the tidal force do nt occur in these models .",
    "since large part of orbital angular momentum of smbhs decreases with time , the violent irregular motions of smbhs appear in model 4 . in the early stage ,",
    "smbhs move in their original elliptical orbits similar to the other models as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ orbit ] .",
    "after about @xmath70 yr , since smbhs lose its angular momentum by the tidal interaction , the motions of smbhs begin to deviate from their original elliptical orbits . due to the deviation ,",
    "position of each smbh becomes asymmetry to the galactic center .",
    "thus , after about @xmath71 yr , each angular momentum of smbhs is exchanged with each other by the gravitational force of another smbh , since the force is not directed to the galactic center and is dominant near the galactic center . as the result , after about @xmath69 yr , large irregular motions of smbhs are induced as shown in the right panel of fig .",

    "we have shown that in the all cases , the smbh binary has large influence on gas motion in the gas disk .",
    "the smbh binary induces some resonances on gas motion in a nuclear gas disk . due to these resonances ,",
    "various dense gas structures are formed in the nuclear gas disk and gaseous spiral arms are formed near the vicinity of outer lindblad resonance . in these dense gas regions , star formation becomes very active . in the high eccentric orbit cases of the smbh binary , gaseous narrow filaments and",
    "dense clump structures are developed well , and active star formation occurs in these regions .",
    "these features can be strong evidence of existence of a smbh binary .",
    "it is very interesting to compare these features with very high - resolution observations of galaxies which are proposed to have a smbh binary .",
    "dense gas structures and distribution of star formation cites will inform us dynamical state of the smbh binary .",
    "it should be noticed that these features are not appeared in the case of which the smbh mass is smaller than about @xmath18 @xmath16 in our model .",
    "we note that when we compare whole sfr of ultra luminous infrared galaxies , the sfrs induced by the smbh binary are not high . however , the sfr is as high as nuclear star bursts in nearby star burst galaxies .    in our simulations ,",

    "since active star formation occurs in very compact regions in the highly eccentric elliptical orbit cases , we expect that these newly formed stars concentrate in compact massive star clusters .",
    "if these star clusters interact gravitationally with the smbh binary , the interaction may induce losing of orbital angular momentum of smbhs due to the unstableness of three body problem in which smbhs and the star cluster interact with each other and ejection of the star cluster occurs .",
    "if these star clusters are massive enough , this process may be very effective and the binary can evolve to a more tightly binding state .",
    "this process may have an important role in merging process of smbhs .",
    "@xcite studied the effect of hydrodynamic drag force by dense gas on evolution of a smbh binary by numerical simulations .",
    "they have shown that after smbhs gradually fall into the galactic central dense gas region by the dynamical friction , effect of hydrodynamical drag becomes very effective in the central region .",
    "they suggested that finally smbhs can be close enough to merge by the hydrodynamic effect . in their simulations , they do nt consider effects of radiative cooling and star formations on gas . by the effect of radiative cooling , many dense clump structures will be formed and those distribution is more complicated .",
    "the dense clumps may interact with smbhs and play an important role in the coalesce of smbhs .",
    "moreover , active star formation will occur in the clumps and gas mass will decrease in the galactic central region . after the active star formation , it is not clear that in the galactic center gas remains enough for hydrodynamic interaction with smbhs or not .",
    "it is needed to make simulations of evolution of a smbh binary in more realistic model .    in our simulations",

    "<S> we study influence of a galactic central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) binary on gas dynamics and star formation activity in a nuclear gas disk by making three - dimensional tree+sph simulations . due to orbital motions of smbhs , </S>",
    "<S> there are various resonances between gas motion and the smbh binary motion . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that these resonances create some characteristic structures of gas in the nuclear gas disk , for examples , gas elongated or filament structures , formation of gaseous spiral arms , and small gas disks around smbhs . in these gaseous dense regions , </S>",
    "<S> active star formations are induced . as the result </S>",
    "<S> , many star burst regions are formed in the nuclear region . </S>"
