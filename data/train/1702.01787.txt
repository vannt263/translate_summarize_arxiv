    "in the last few years , a substantial amount of experimental and theoretical efforts have been devoted worldwide to investigate the strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions of temperature and/or baryon chemical potential . while at low baryon chemical potential and high temperature lattice quantum chromo dynamics ( lqcd ) data seem to indicate a smooth crossover from hadronic to quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase @xcite , at high baryon chemical potential and low temperature the system is expected to have a first - order phase transition @xcite .",
    "this first order phase transition line at high baryon chemical potential and low temperature should end at a critical end point ( cep ) , a second - order phase transition point as one moves towards the high temperature and low baryon chemical potential region , in the qcd phase diagram .",
    "heavy ion collisions provide a unique tool to create and study strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions of temperature and/or baryon chemical potential .",
    "one of the primary goals of heavy - ion collision experiments is to map qcd phase diagram in terms of temperature and baryon chemical potential . at present",
    ", the properties of qcd matter at high temperature and almost zero baryon chemical potential are being investigated using ultra relativistic heavy ion collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , cern and relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) .",
    "the beam energy scan ( bes ) program of rhic is currently investigating the location of the cep .",
    "the hades experiment at gsi , darmstadt is investigating medium of very large baryon chemical potential .",
    "the region of large baryon chemical potential will also be explored by the na61-shine experiment at cern - sps . in future ,",
    "the compressed baryonic matter ( cbm ) experiment at the facility for antiproton and ion research ( fair ) at gsi and the nuclotron - based ion collider facility ( nica ) at jinr , dubna will also study nuclear matter at large baryon chemical potential .",
    "lqcd provides the most direct approach to study the qcd matter at high temperature .",
    "however , at finite chemical potential , lqcd faces the well - known sign problem . on the other hand , the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model @xcite , which is used in this present work , provide a simpler alternative to study strongly interacting matter at finite temperature and chemical potential .",
    "the hrg model is quite successful in describing the bulk properties of hadronic matter in thermal and chemical equilibrium @xcite .",
    "this model is also successful in describing the ratios of hadron yields , at chemical freeze - out , created in central heavy ion collisions from sis up to rhic energies  @xcite . in a heavy ion collision experiment ,",
    "the chemical freeze - out is defined as the stage in the evolution of the thermal system when inelastic collisions among the particles cease and the particle ratios become fixed . at various center - of - mass energies @xmath0 , particle yields or ratios are generally analysed phenomenologically using hrg model @xcite to determine the chemical freeze - out parameters .",
    "relations of chemical freeze - out temperature and baryon chemical potential with @xmath0 establish the chemical freeze - out line @xcite in the qcd phase diagram .",
    "the main result of these investigations is that the chemical freeze - out temperature increases sharply from sis up to sps energies and reaches , for higher collision energies , at constant values near @xmath3 mev while baryon chemical potential decreases sharply as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "chemical freeze - out is the earliest stage in the evolution of the hadronic phase which can be determined phenomenologically from the experiment data .",
    "therefore , the chemical freeze - out line is very much important in the qcd phase diagram .",
    "there are several universal chemical freeze - out descriptions in the existing literature which can approximately describe the chemical freeze - out line in the qcd phase diagram .",
    "those universal chemical freeze - out descriptions are independent of @xmath0 and they are related to the bulk thermodynamic properties of the system . finding out the universal conditions of chemical freeze - out parameters have been the subject of various studies .",
    "our aim in the present work is twofold .",
    "first , we would like to study some basic bulk thermodynamic properties like pressure , energy density and specific heat of the matter in the hrg and an excluded volume hrg model .",
    "second , we would like to find out universal conditions of chemical freeze - out descriptions from those thermodynamic quantities .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "first , the ideal hrg model and an excluded volume hrg model are briefly discussed .",
    "then the region of applicability of non - interacting hrg model and its interacting version i.e. , evhrg model have been discussed using the lqcd data of pressure and energy density .",
    "thereafter , results of specific heat have bean presented .",
    "finally , two new universal chemical freeze - out descriptions bases on pressure and specific heat respectively have been proposed .",
    "in the hrg model , the thermal system consists of all the hadrons and resonances .",
    "there are varieties of hrg models in the existing literature",
    ". different versions of this model and some of the recent works using these models may be found in refs .",
    "the partition function of a hadron resonance gas in the grand canonical ensemble can be written as @xmath4 where the sum is over all the particles .",

    "the upper and lower sign corresponds to baryons and mesons respectively . in this present work ,",
    "all the hadrons and resonances listed in the particle data book up to a mass of 3 gev @xcite have been incorporated .",
    "it is assumed that the hadronic matter is in thermal and chemical equilibrium .",
    "therefore non - equilibrium phenomena like decays of particles have been ignored in this present work .",
    "the partition function is the basic quantity from which one can calculate various thermodynamic quantities of the thermal system . the pressure @xmath16 , the energy density @xmath17 of the thermal system and the number density @xmath18 of i - th particle can be calculated using the standard definitions ,    @xmath19 ,   \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath20\\pm1}e_i , \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath21\\pm1}. \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in case of heavy - ion collision experiments , the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath22 of hrg model corresponds to those at chemical freeze - out which are believed to depend on initial conditions of the collision .",

    "for central au + au or pb + pb collisions @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are respectively proton numbers and neutron numbers of the colliding nuclei .",
    "in the ideal hrg model particles are point - like .",
    "although attractive interactions between hadrons are incorporated through the presence of resonances , repulsive interactions are ignored completely in this framework . however , the repulsive interactions are also needed , especially at very high temperature and/ or large baryonic chemical potential , to catch the basic qualitative features of strong interactions where the ideal gas assumption becomes inadequate . in the evhrg model ,",
    "hadronic phase is modelled by a gas of interacting particles , where the geometrical sizes of the particles are explicitly incorporated as the excluded volume correction to approximate the short - range van der waals type repulsive interaction .    in evhrg model pressure",

    ", one can get the pressure .",
    "the pressure @xmath35 is suppressed compared to the ideal gas pressure @xmath16 because of the smaller value of effective chemical potential .",

    "the difference of the evhrg model , as compared to hrg , is governed by the radius parameter .",

    "figure [ fig : inv_chi2_dof_t170 ] shows that @xmath51 is maximum for @xmath56 .",
    "hence the excluded volume effect can be ignored at the lower temperature ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "a similar comment was also there in the ref .",

    "it can be seen that there is almost no effect of interaction till @xmath58 mev both in pressure and energy density .",
    "the reason for this is that the effective degree of freedom of the system does not increase much up to this temperature and therefore correction due to excluded volume is small .",
    "beyond @xmath59 mev a substantial change in these quantities has been observed .",
    "it can be seen from this figure that at large @xmath9 normalised pressure as well as normalised energy density are suppressed compared to the ideal hrg if we take non - zero hardcore radii of the particles .",
