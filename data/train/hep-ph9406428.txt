    "<S> _    a very exciting potential application of photon - photon collisions at a 100 - 200  gev linear collider is the intermediate mass higgs boson production in photon fusion reaction @xcite @xmath5 in addition , new interesting method was proposed @xcite to measure the parity of the higgs states in linearly polarized photon - photon collisions . </S>",
    "<S> it provides an opportunity to investigate non - trivial assignment of the quantum numbers for higgs particles in extended models such as supersymmetric theories which include both scalar @xmath6 and pseudoscalar @xmath7 states @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> extracting the intermediate mass higgs signal in photon - photon collisions is a hard task since large number of @xmath3 background events must be rejected @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial assumption is that these large backgrounds can be actively suppressed by exploiting the polarization dependence of the cross sections . far above the threshold , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath8 cross section is dominated by initial photons in the @xmath9 helicity state . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account that the higgs signal comes from the @xmath10 channel , polarized collisions can be used to enhance the signal while simultaneously suppressing the background @xcite ( see also detailed discussion in these proceedings @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> but the question remains how do qcd radiative corrections influence these conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> while it is known that far above the threshold the magnitude of these corrections is moderate for unpolarized collisions @xcite , one can expect that their effects will be especially large for @xmath11 production in @xmath10 helicity state , where the tree level contribution is suppressed as @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> we present here the results of the one - loop calculation of the qcd corrections to @xmath3 quark pair production in polarized photon - photon collisions retaining the full dependence on the quark masses . </S>",
    "<S> the total cross section calculated up to the order @xmath13 is given by the sum of tree - level @xmath8 contribution , the interference term between one - loop and the tree level contributions , and tree level contribution from quark pair production accompanied by gluon emission @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the first two contributions lead to two parton final states converting mainly into two jets , while the third one leads to three parton production converting both into two- and three - jet final states . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that three parton final states with collinear and/or soft gluon will appear experimentally as two jets . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , only the sum of the cross sections of @xmath11 production and @xmath15 with soft or collinear gluon is free from infrared divergences and has no singularities in the limit @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> so , as usual , we consider the three parton state to represent two - jet final state if the invariant mass of two partons is sufficiently small @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the invariant mass squared of two partons @xmath19 and @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the total c.m.s . </S>",

    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 shows total ( _ i.e. _ two - jet plus three - jet ) and two - jet ( @xmath22 ) cross sections for @xmath3 pair production in polarized monochromatic @xmath4 collisions . while the qcd corrections for @xmath9 photon helicities are quite small , those for @xmath10 enhance @xmath23 production by an order of magnitude or even larger . for @xmath1 production </S>",
    "<S> the situation is more complicated : the corrected total cross section is smaller than the tree level @xmath24 cross section for @xmath25  gev and larger for larger energies . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is more pronounced for two - jet production . for small values of @xmath26 </S>",
    "<S> the two - jet differential cross section is even negative in some regions of the phase space . </S>",
    "<S> this means that for @xmath1 production at @xmath2  gev all three contributions ( lowest order , virtual and gluon emission ) are of the same order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> this is unlike the case of @xmath23 production , where the gluon emission contribution dominates . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the approach of @xcite , where only one contribution from radiative processes @xmath27 is taken into account in the limit @xmath28 , @xmath29 ( for @xmath10 and @xmath30 the cross section is given by this only contribution ) , may be relevant for @xmath23 production , but is definitely not applicable for @xmath1 production .    fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 shows the events rates of signal and background two - jet final states in photon - photon collisions . </S>",
    "<S> we make here the same assumptions as in @xcite , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ we choose the broad photon - photon luminosity spectrum resulting from polarized linac and laser in the @xmath31 direction , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , parameter @xmath34 and geometric factor @xmath35 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also assume the linac beam energy to be equal to 125  gev and integrated effective luminosity of 10  fb@xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> such a choice is preferable when trying to cover the entire intermediate higgs mass region . </S>",
    "<S> we ignore here backgrounds from @xmath37 and @xmath38 processes @xcite , which are essential for @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the backgrounds coming from the resolved photon contributions @xmath40 are also shown . while resolved photon contributions make almost impossible to observe the intermediate mass higgs signal at 500  gev linear collider @xcite , these backgrounds are much less significant at 250  gev due to a steeply falling gluon spectrum ( see also @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> qcd corrections to higgs decay into @xmath1 @xcite are also taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> we use a cut of @xmath41 in the laboratory frame and not in c.m . </S>",
    "<S> frame as in @xcite . cut in the laboratory frame gives slightly better statistical significance of the higgs signal . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we assume 5% @xmath23-to-@xmath1 misidentification probability . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the combined background ( _ i.e. _ @xmath42 ) is represented by dotted line and can be compared with the signal denoted by solid line .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  3 presents the statistical significance of the higgs boson signal estimated from tree level as well as one - loop calculations including the resolved photon contributions . </S>",
    "<S> this plot assumes 90% @xmath1-tagging efficiency for the @xmath1 final states and the resolution for reconstructing the invariant mass of a two - jet events to be gaussian with @xmath43 . from this figure </S>",
    "<S> one can conclude that it is advantageous to select two - jet final states and to impose the angular cut in the laboratory frame . </S>",
    "<S> the account of qcd corrections reduces the statistical significance of higgs signal almost by a factor of two in comparison to tree - level result . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless the intermediate mass higgs boson can be observed in @xmath4 collisions at least at the level of 5@xmath44 in the mass interval from 80 to 160  gev . </S>",
    "<S> our estimates here should be considered as a first - order determination of the influence of qcd radiative corrections on the statistical error in the measurement of the two - photon higgs width . a more detailed analyses including full detector simulation is certainly needed .    </S>",
