    "the parikh - wilczek model @xcite gives us an intuitive description of black hole evaporation , that is , hawking radiation @xcite from the schwarzschild black hole is described by a tunneling process across the black hole horizon @xcite .",
    "the semiclassical hawking temperature is derived by evaluating semiclassical emission rate , and it can be written in terms of the difference of entropies before and after the emissions . in the case of a radiation from black hole , which we denote a quanta as @xmath1 and the black hole mass as @xmath2 ,",
    "the tunneling rate is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the change in the black hole entropy during the emission process @xmath5 in @xcite , after quantum correction to surface gravity is included , the logarithmic correction to the bekenstein - hawking area law for a sufficiently large black hole mass @xmath2 is derived as @xmath6 here @xmath7 is a model dependent dimensionless parameter , and the sign of @xmath7 could be either positive or negative depending on with which spin particles are included in the loop calculation .    in this letter , after reviewing mutual information in the framework of the parikh - wilczek model , we discuss its generalization to n - partite information .",
    "we show that a behavior of n - partite information , positive ( negative ) for even ( odd ) @xmath0 , agrees with the holographic computation .",
    "we also show that , in the case of ads schwarzschild black hole , the quantity of total mutual information can be a reference index for the hawking - page phase transition .",
    "thanks to the nonthermal spectrum in the parikh - wilczek model , one expects some kind of entanglement or correlation between two successive emissions .",
    "there is no clear picture of which microstates responsible for black hole entropy , not to mention entanglement among them .",
    "however , it is the academical guess to imagine such entanglement is via quantum gravity and its quantity could be accumulated and classically described by some extensive macroscopic quantity , such as black hole mass and entropy @xcite .",
    "entropy loss for a black hole of mass @xmath2 due to a radiation of a mass quantum @xmath8 reads @xmath9    since conservation of entropy is one essential feature in the parikh - wilczek tunneling model , the entanglement between the black hole and the radiation , if any , should be able to identify in ( [ eqn : entropy_change ] ) .",
    "the first two terms are _ classical _ for its survival after quantum correction is removed for @xmath10 . in particular",
    ", we would like to call the first term as the _ classical correlation _ between the black hole and the emission quanta , which is proportional to total newton s gravitational force flux between two massive objects .",
    "the second term is seemed as the _ self correlation _ , which measures the maximum entropy a radiation could carry as if it collapsed into a small black hole .",
    "this leaves us the last term as a candidate for the desired quantum entanglement .",
    "though there is only single emitted quantum involved , this term actually represents the entanglement between the black hole and one emission , denoting as @xmath11}_{i } = 8\\pi \\alpha \\ln(1-\\frac{\\omega_i}{m}).\\ ] ] the entanglement is negative in generic and becomes @xmath12 at the zero temperature limit @xmath13 .",
    "then the bipartite information among two emitted quanta @xmath8 and @xmath14 can be defined by the conventional way : @xmath15}_{ij}\\equiv i^{[1]}_{i } + i^{[1]}_{j } - i^{[1]}_{(ij ) } =   8\\pi \\alpha \\ln{\\frac{(m-\\omega_i)(m-\\omega_j)}{m(m-\\omega_i-\\omega_j)}}.\\ ] ]    since the bipartite information is expected to be positive definite , this suggests @xmath16 is also suggested in several discussions , such as effects of loop corrections @xcite and a black hole remnant @xcite ] . on the other hand , if we define another quantity , denoting as _ mutual information _ , to measure how does the entropy change for an emission @xmath14 depend on whether an earlier emission @xmath8 happens or not , that is @xmath17}_{ij } \\equiv s_e(m,\\omega_j \\big|\\omega_i)-s_e(m,\\omega_j)= 8\\pi \\omega_i\\omega_j + i^{[2]}_{ij},\\ ] ] where @xmath18 for the tunneling model @xcite .",
    "we see that @xmath19}$ ] exactly captures the quantum part of this mutual information .",
    "the difference is the classical correlation among two emitted quanta .",
    "we remark that if it were for thermal hawking radiation , one expects two emissions are totally independent event or mass loss due to previous emission can be ignored . to see this",
    ", we could first rescale @xmath20 and equations ( [ eqn : bipartite_quantum ] ) and ( [ eqn : mutualinfo ] ) become @xmath21}_{ij } = 8 \\pi \\alpha \\ln{\\frac{m^2-\\epsilon(\\omega_i+\\omega_j)m+\\epsilon^2 \\omega_i\\omega_j}{m^2-\\epsilon(\\omega_i+\\omega_j)m } } , \\nonumber\\\\ & & e^{[2]}_{ij } = 8\\pi \\epsilon^2 \\omega_i\\omega_j + i^{[2]}_{ij}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is easy to see that both quantities vanish if we only keep terms up to linear order @xmath22 , even the quantum correction coefficient @xmath23 .",
    "it is straightforward to compute entanglement for @xmath0 quanta of radiations . for instance , the tripartite information can be expressed in terms of bipartite information : @xmath24}_{ijk}\\equiv i^{[2]}_{ij}+i^{[2]}_{ik}-i^{[2]}_{i(jk)}=8\\pi \\alpha \\ln{\\frac{(m-\\omega_i)(m-\\omega_j)(m-\\omega_k)(m-\\omega_i-\\omega_j-\\omega_k)}{m(m-\\omega_i-\\omega_j)(m-\\omega_i-\\omega_k)(m-\\omega_j-\\omega_k)}}.\\ ] ] it can be shown explicitly that the subadditive inequality @xmath25}_{ijk}<0 $ ] is satisfied for @xmath26 .",
    "it worths to mention that one obtains the same result for @xmath25}$ ] by using the definition ( [ eqn : mutualinfo ] ) for bipartite information .",
    "in fact , the term associated with classical correlation always vanishes in the @xmath27}$ ] for any @xmath28 .",
    "we believe that this is because the law of newton s gravitational force is designed for pairs of massive objects , and there does not exist force formula for three or more objects .",
    "after all , the @xmath0-partite information can be computed iteratively from @xmath29-partite : @xmath30}_{i_1i_2\\cdots i_{n-1 } } & & = i^{[n-1]}_{i_1i_2\\cdots i_{n-2}i_{n-1}}+i^{[n-1]}_{i_1i_2\\cdots i_{n-2}i_{n}}-i^{[n-1]}_{i_1i_2\\cdots ( i_{n-1 } i_{n})}\\nonumber\\\\ & & = 8\\pi\\alpha \\ln{\\frac { { \\displaystyle \\prod_{p } } ( m-\\omega_{i_p } ) { \\displaystyle \\prod_{p < s < t } } ( m-\\omega_{i_p}-\\omega_{i_s}-\\omega_{i_t})\\cdots}{m { \\displaystyle \\prod_{p",

    ", we prove that the @xmath0-partite information is always positive for even @xmath0 and negative for odd @xmath0 .",
    "the alternative sign is in agreement with recent computation in holographic spatial partite @xcite .",
    "here we define another quantity which is a generalization of mutual information , denoting as total bipartite information , defined by @xmath33}_{i_1 i_2\\cdots i_n }   \\equiv \\sum_{k=1}^n   i^{[1]}_{i_k } - i^{[1]}_{i_1 i_2 \\cdots i_n   } , \\ ] ] or equivalently , this quantity can be described by summing up all bipartite information among @xmath0 emissions : @xmath34}_{i_1 i_2\\cdots i_n }   = i^{[2]}_{i_1i_2 } + i^{[2]}_{(i_1i_2 ) i_3 } + i^{[2]}_{(i_1 i_2 i_3 ) i_4 } + \\cdots + i^{[2]}_{(i_1 i_2 \\cdots i_{n-1 } ) i_n }   =   8 \\pi   \\ln \\frac { { \\displaystyle \\prod_p } ( m-\\omega_{i_p})}{m^{n-1}(m- { \\displaystyle \\sum_p } \\omega_{i_p})}.\\ ] ] it turns out that @xmath35 } $ ] grows with number of emissions @xmath0 since the bipartite information in is positive definite . in the appendix [ app2 ] , we prove that this function is a decreasing function with increasing black hole mass @xmath2 .",
    "since we know that @xmath0 increases or @xmath2 becomes less at later time in the process of hawking radiation , this monotonically - growing quantity could be interpreted as quantum entanglement entropy , which plays a similar role as in the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "we remark that the entanglement entropy @xmath35}$ ] could serve as a quantity running with rg flow in @xmath36-dimension since @xmath37}}{\\partial \\beta } = m\\frac{\\partial j^{[n]}}{\\partial m } < 0,\\ ] ] where uv ( ir ) regime refers to the limit @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "one can also define the total mutual information to include the classical correlation among @xmath0 emissions : @xmath40}_{i_1 i_2 \\cdots i_n } \\equiv e^{[2]}_{i_1i_2 } + e^{[2]}_{(i_1i_2)i_3 } + e^{[2]}_{(i_1 i_2 i_3 ) i_4 } + \\cdots + e^{[2]}_{(i_1 i_2 \\cdots i_{n-1 } ) i_n } = \\sum_{p < s } 8\\pi \\omega_{i_p } \\omega_{i_s } + j^{[n]}_{i_1 i_2 \\cdots i_n}.\\ ] ] this quantity also grows with @xmath0 thanks to increasing pairwise correlation .",
    "however we shall see in the next section that it does not always behave in this way .",
    "a schwarzschild black hole has a negative specific heat in the asymptotic flat spacetime so it can not help but radiate till the last bit .",
    "however , a black hole in the asymptotic ads behaves differently while the ads boundary acts like a reflecting wall .",
    "a small black hole still behaves similarly as in the flat spacetime , however a large black hole would reach thermal equilibrium with its own radiation reflected from the boundary wall .",
    "the phase transition happening in between these two limits is called the hawking - page phase transition @xcite .",

    "though the definition of ( [ eqn : one_partite ] ) comes quite naturally from the tunneling model of hawking radiation , it would be more satisfying to understand it from the aspect of black hole microstates or some effective theory .",
    "with that being said , we recall that for a two - dimensional conformal field theory quench system , the late time behavior of the entanglement entropy between two separated half regions grows like @xcite @xmath72 for central charge @xmath48 and some uv cutoff @xmath73 . here",
