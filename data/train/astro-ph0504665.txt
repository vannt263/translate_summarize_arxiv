    "we have fitted the near - infrared ( @xmath35 ) photometry from the literature with a blackbody function modified by a line - of - sight extinction curve : @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the planck function , @xmath38 is the frequency - dependent extinction ( r=3.1 assumed , * ? ? ? * ) , and @xmath39 is the solid angle .    a temperature range of @xmath40 k in steps of 100 k and an extinction range of @xmath41 mag in steps of 0.05 mag were tested .",

    "results of the fitting are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the sed for svs20-n is reasonably well fit with a @xmath43 k blackbody screened by an extinction of @xmath44 mag ( @xmath45 ) with a luminosity of l@xmath46 0.9 l@xmath47  similar to the values for other low - mass young stellar objects ( e.g. , iras 04016 + 2610 : @xmath48 , * ? ? ?",
    "the sed modeling for svs20-s is less constrained .",
    "the reduced chi - square for the fits are never better than @xmath49 , regardless of the combination of temperature and extinction .",
    "there is a broad localized minimum for the temperature range @xmath50 k with corresponding extinctions of @xmath51 mag .",

    "models with higher extinction do not have localized minima ; the reduced chi - squares asymptotically approach @xmath53 .",
    "figure 4 displays the dependence of the model chi - square as a function of temperature for four different extinction levels .",
    "we conservatively estimate that the central protostar for svs20-s is a 10,000 k blackbody , screened by @xmath54 mag of extinction  suggesting a luminosity of l@xmath55 l@xmath47 , which is comparable to estimates made by @xcite .",
    "the extinguished single - temperature blackbody fits to the near - infrared seds represent estimates of the total visual extinction of the central protostar by the surrounding circumstellar disk and the molecular envelope .",
    "if a common envelope contributes @xmath2114 magnitudes of extinction @xcite , then the circumstellar material immediately surrounding each protostar extinguishes the central protostar by @xmath56 magnitudes .",
    "the modelling reduced chi - squares of @xmath57 are likely the result of the single - temperature assumption , as evidenced by the extinguished blackbody models predicting too little 10  continuum emission ( see fig .",
    "the observed mid - infrared spectrum of svs20-s exhibits an emission feature with the peak of the emission occurring near 11.3 @xmath17 m . in more evolved sources such as haebe stars ,",
    "the emission peak at 11.3  is indicative of crystalline silicate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as amorphous olivine particles ( @xmath58 m in size ) emit a feature peaking near 9.7 @xmath17 m @xcite . as amorphous silicate grains grow in size , the emission feature broadens and becomes flat - topped @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite correlate the strength of the silicate emission feature with the ratio of the 11.3 @xmath17 m to the 9.8 @xmath17 m flux densities .",
    "a ratio of @xmath59 suggests emission from crystalline silicates @xcite .",
    "@xcite extend this technique by correlating the @xmath60 and the @xmath61 ratios .",
    "they find that the ratios are linearly correlated , and that sources with crystalline silicate emission possess lower ratios than those sources with only amorphous silicate emission .    for the observed svs20-s spectrum ,",
    "we have calculated the @xmath62 and the @xmath61 ratios from the continuum - normalized spectrum ( figure 5 ) .",
    "we measured ratios of @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "these ratios place svs20-s in the same region of the @xmath65 $ ] color - color diagram as the more evolved t tauri star hen 3 - 600a and the haebe star hd179218 , both of which have crystalline silicate emission ( see figure 11 in * ? ? ?",
    ". however , these ratios for svs20-s , while similar to those observed in more evolved pre - main sequence stars with known crystalline grain emission , do not take into account that svs20-s , unlike the more evolved t tauri and haebe stars , has a significant amount ( @xmath66 mag ) of foreground absorption from the surrounding envelope ( see  3.3 ) .    for svs20-n , the observed mid - infrared spectrum , in contrast to svs20-s , is dominated by an absorption feature centered at 9.7 @xmath17 m .",
    "the mid - infrared spectrum of svs20-n resembles other low - mass embedded class i young stellar objects such as iras  04239 + 2436 @xcite , or iras  04108 + 2803b @xcite , where the amorphous silicate absorption at 9.7 @xmath17 m is clearly present but shallow ( @xmath67 below the continuum level ) .",
    "we have calculated the optical depth of the absorption based upon the estimated continuum level ( fig 2 ) : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the observed flux density and @xmath70 is the flux density of the continuum .",
    "the optical depth for svs20-n as a function of wavelength is presented in figure 5 .",
    "assuming @xmath71 @xcite , the peak optical depth of @xmath0 corresponds to a line - of - sight visual extinction of only @xmath72 mag .",
    "the extinction derived from the silicate optical depth is nearly 10 magnitudes lower than the envelope extinction implied by the 3.1  ice feature @xcite .",
    "the lower observed optical depth implies that the mid - infrared spectrum of svs20-n contains silicate emission that is filling in partially ( @xmath73 ) the line - of - sight absorption from the surrounding envelope .",
    "in addition , there is a decrease in the optical depth near 11.3 indicating that some of the emission may be from crystalline silicate emission . in the following section ,",
    "the effect of the envelope absorption on the innate mid - infrared emission from svs20-s and svs20-n is discussed .      to probe the effects of the line - of - sight absorption by the surrounding common molecular envelope on the observed mid - infrared spectra",
    ", we developed a model of the expected extinction by the dust grains contained within the common envelope .",
    "indices of refraction of amorphous olivine @xcite were used with mie theory to calculate the wavelength - dependent extinction coefficients for particles 0.15 micron in diameter . based upon the 3.1  ice feature @xcite",
    ", we assumed that the peak line - of - sight extinction produced by the envelope is a@xmath74 mag for both svs20-s and svsv20-n .",
    "the envelope dust was assumed to be cool ( @xmath75 k ) enough to produce no substantial mid - infrared emission of its own @xcite .",
    "the mid - infrared spectra corrected for the envelope extinction @xmath76 $ ] are presented in figure 6 .",
    "these spectra represent the expected mid - infrared emission of the protostars , after the removal of the surrounding common envelope extinction .",
    "the protostellar mid - infrared emission is dominated by the emission of amorphous silicates , which , in both protostars , peaks at @xmath77 .",
    "the silicate emission above the continuum from svs20-s is four times the strength of the silicate emission from svs20-n .",
    "this is likely a direct result of the different temperatures and luminosities of the central objects (  3.1 ) , where svs20-s is three times hotter and 20 times more luminous than svs20-n .",
    "after the extinction correction , the @xmath31  spectral indices for svs20-s and svs20-n , respectively , are @xmath78 and @xmath79 , suggesting that while the binary is still deeply embedded , the components of svs20 may be evolving towards class ii young stellar objects .",
    "if we apply the flux density ratios developed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , we find for svs20-s , that @xmath80 , and for svs20-n , that @xmath81 .",
    "these new ratios are significantly larger than those derived prior to the correction of the line - of - sight extinction , and taken by themselves place svs20-s and svs20-n among t tauri and haebe stars with no detectable crystalline emission .",
    "however , while the spectra for both svs20-s and svs20-n are dominated by amorphous olivine emission , it is evident from fig . 6",
    "that there is also additional emission near 11.3 producing a shoulder on the broader olivine emission feature . to study this feature in more detail ,",
    "we have fitted a local continuum to the spectra between @xmath82 .",
    "the continuum levels for the mid - infrared emission underlying the observed features are estimated via a quadratic interpolation of the flux density levels near the endpoints : @xmath83\\ \\&\\ \\left [ 11.8 - 12.1\\ \\mu\\rm{m}\\right ] $ ] .",
    "the continuum - subtracted spectra are displayed in the bottom panel of figure 6 .",
    "the emission in this local region from svs20-s remains four times the strength of the emission from svs20-n , but both sources show clear peaks near @xmath84  and @xmath85 .",
    "the peak centered near 11.3  tentatively is associated with forsterite mg@xmath86sio@xmath87 @xcite .",
    "this forsterite peak is always accompanied by an additional narrrow peak at 10  which is evident in both sources ( top , fig .",
    "the narrower peak at @xmath85  tentatively is associated with with enstatite mgsio@xmath88 @xcite .",
    "enstatite is also associated with broader peaks near @xmath89  and 10.5 .",
    "evidence for emission from these features in excess of the amorphous silicate emission can also be seen in both sources ( top , fig .",
    "6 ) . finally , as mentioned in  2 , there is no resolved extended mid - infrared emission indicating that all of the silciate emission ( amorphous and crystalline ) is contained within @xmath90 au of the central protostars .",
    "thus , both svs20-s and svs20-n appear to have begun processing and annealing the dust grains within their local environments .",
    "we have presented spatially resolved mid - infrared ( @xmath91 m ) spectra of the class i / flat - spectrum protostellar binary serpens svs20-(s , n ) .",
    "we summarize our results as follows :    \\(1 ) although svs20-s and svs20-n have similar broadband spectral energy distributions , our simple models suggest that the temperatures and luminosities of the two central objects are quite different .",
    "the central protostellar source in svs20-s has a effective temperature of t@xmath92 k and a luminosity of l@xmath93 l@xmath47 , while the central protostar in svs20-n has an effective temperature of t@xmath94 k and a luminosity of only l@xmath95 l@xmath47 .",
    "\\(2 ) the observed mid - infrared spectra of the binary components also differ . the spectrum of svs20-s exhibits strong silicate emission , while that of svs20-n is dominated by shallow amorphous silicate absorption .",
    "after correction for the line - of - sight common envelope extinction , the mid - infrared emission of the protostars for the two objects are dominated by amorphous silicate emission , although the emission feature from svs20-s is four times the strength of the emission feature from svs20-n . in addition to the amorphous silicate emission , _ both",
    "_ svs20-s and svs20-n show evidence for the presence of emission from crystalline silicate in the form of forsterite and enstatite .",
    "\\(3 ) the different luminosities of the two components may be responsible for the different amounts of crystalline silicate emission observed in each component .",
    "the lower luminosity of svs20-n may have resulted in longer processing times for the circumstellar material , although the apparent presence of crystalline emission indicates that , even for lower mass young stellar objects , crystallinization occurs relatively early in the star formation process .    in order to understand more fully the binary system svs20 , modelling of the complete spectral energy distribution coupled with accretion processes and mineralogy",
    "will be the subject of a future paper .",
    "the differences in the spectra clearly indicate a different level of dust processing between the two protostars .",
    "the presence of crystalline silicates in such a young binary protostellar system indicates that the grain growth and processing found in more evolved pre - main sequence stars , in debris disks around main sequence stars , and in comets in our own solar system begins at a much younger evolutionary stage while accretion is still ongoing .",
