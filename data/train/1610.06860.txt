    "electrophysiology studies record the electrical activity produced by neurons .",
    "they allow the study of the association between sensory stimuli and neural response in any part of the brain .",
    "neurons produce sudden changes in their membrane potential known as ` spikes ' , that can be recorded using microelectrodes .",
    "the analysis of the frequency of spike discharges provides insights on how the neurons and the nervous system work .",
    "visual receptive fields ( rfs ) are small areas of the visual field that a particular visual neuron ` sees ' .",
    "reverse cross - correlation is a receptive field mapping technique used for studying how visual neurons process signals from different positions in their receptive field . from the neuron responses",
    "( spikes ) we can infer the spatio - temporal properties of the rfs ( i.e. , when and where a sensory stimulus produces a response ) .",
    "a detailed explanation on how the reverse cross - correlation technique was used in the experiments analyzed here can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "schematically , the subject ( a monkey ) was viewing two monitors ( one for each eye ) with a fixation target . within a square area",
    "a bright or dark spot was flashed at different positions in a pseudorandom manner .",
    "neuron spikes were recorded while the stimulus was delivered . when a spike was produced , the stimulus position at several pre - spike times was read . as a result ,",
    "a set of numerical matrices ( one for each pre - spike time ) containing the number ( counts ) of times the stimulus was at that given position when a spike occurred is obtained .",
    "the graphical representation of each of these matrices is called receptive field map ( rfmap ) , and can be regarded as a representation of the firing rate of the neuron .",
    "for each neuron , the reverse cross - correlation technique provides a dataset consisting of a series of @xmath0 matrices of dimension @xmath1 , each matrix corresponding to the different pre - spike times considered ( between @xmath2 to @xmath3 milliseconds ) .",
    "we adopted a poisson model which expresses the neuron response ( i.e. , number of spikes ) as a smooth function of both space and time @xmath4\\right ) = log\\left(n_{rc}\\lambda_{rct}\\right ) = log\\left(n_{rc}\\right ) + f\\left(r , c , t\\right ) , \\label{mx : poissonmodel}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 indicates the row of the matrix , @xmath6 the column ( @xmath7 ) , and @xmath8 the pre - spike time ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "@xmath10 denotes the number of stimulus presentations on each particular grid position of the square area ( the offset ) and @xmath11 is the intensity parameter ( or firing rate ) .",
    "the smooth function @xmath12 was represented by the tensor product of three univariate b - spline basis @xcite , i.e. , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the kronecker product .    in order to avoid over - fitting",
    ", the previous model can be estimated by penalized - likelihood methods @xcite . in the absence of locally adaptive smoothness ,",
    "the anisotropic penalty matrix is defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the smoothing parameters , and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) are difference matrices of possibly different order @xmath21 .    in adaptive p - spline smoothing ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) each @xmath22 in ( [ mx:2dpenalty ] ) is replaced by a vector of smoothing parameters @xmath23 , where each component is associated with one coefficient difference ( along the @xmath24-direction ) . however",
    ", this approach would imply as many smoothing parameters as coefficient differences , which could lead to under - smoothing and unstable computations . to reduce the dimension",
    ", @xmath23 is modelled by means of b - splines , i.e. , @xmath25 where @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) are b - spline regression matrices , with less columns than rows to ensure that the dimension is in fact reduced .",
    "the _ adaptive _ penalty matrix in three dimensions can be then expressed as @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the column @xmath30 of @xmath31 .",
    "estimation of the three - dimensional p - spline model for poisson data ( [ mx : poissonmodel ] ) subject to the adaptive penalty defined in ( [ mx:3dap ] ) can be based on its mixed - model representation .",
    "restricted maximum likelihood ( reml ) estimates of the variance components ( or smoothing parameters ) are obtained by means of the _ separation of overlapping penalties _ ( sop ) algorithm , recently proposed by @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the reformulation of model ( [ mx : poissonmodel ] ) as a mixed model does not gives rise to a diagonal precision matrix , and thus , some of the computational advantages of sop are lost .",
    "nevertheless , even in this case , the algorithm provides reasonable computing times .",
    "besides , generalized linear array models ( glam , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be used to compute the inner products involved in the mixed model equations as well as the penalty matrices given in ( [ mx:3dap ] ) , thus improving the speed of the estimation algorithm .",
    "for illustration purposes , we show the results for a single visual neuron from area v1 ( primary visual cortical area ) . model ( [ mx : poissonmodel ] ) was estimated with and without assuming locally adaptive smoothness by means of the sop algorithm and glam . in both cases , we used second - order differences ( @xmath32 ) and marginal b - splines bases of dimension @xmath33 . for the adaptive approach",
    ", we chose @xmath34 ( i , j = 1,2,3 ) , yielding a total of @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) smoothing parameters ( or variance components ) .",
    "animation [ mx : fap0 ] and figure [ mx : fap1 ] show the observed and estimated series of smooth rfmaps for several pre - spike times using both approaches .",
    "as it can be seen , both analyses show a central area of high values that represents the visual rf of the neuron , which is in concordance with the raw data . however , there are two major differences : whereas the non adaptive approach seems to indicate that the time between sensory stimulus and response spans from @xmath37 to @xmath38 ms , the adaptive method reduces this time span from @xmath39 to @xmath38 ms .",
    "also the adaptive approach shows a sharper increase and a larger estimate of the firing rate than the non - adaptive approach ( see also figure [ mx : fap2 ] ) . in terms of computational effort , in the absence of adaptive smoothness the algorithm needed about @xmath40 seconds , whereas the complexity afforded by the adaptive approach increased the computing time to @xmath41 seconds .",
