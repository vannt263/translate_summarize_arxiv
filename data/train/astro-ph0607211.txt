    "the discoveries of extrasolar giant planets and brown dwarfs in 1995 have opened up exciting new fields in astrophysics .",
    "these enable model atmospheres to be directly tested against observations for atmospheric temperatures and pressures at which a large number of molecules that had not been considered before in stellar astrophysics reside .",
    "moreover , many of the extrasolar planets , including the first to be discovered , are much closer to their parent star than mercury is to the sun so the atmospheric conditions of these planets are totally unlike any previously investigated . in such situations , many of these molecules are subjected to a large ultraviolet flux from the parent star .",
    "the absorption of radiation by molecules is generally much more complicated than by atoms .",
    "since many of the molecules in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and extrasolar giant planets had not been studied in detail in an astrophysical context before 1995 , their properties are still poorly known .",
    "even those that had been investigated , had not been for the temperatures ( 100 - 3000 k ) and pressures ( 10@xmath7 - 100 atmospheres ) found in the atmospheres of such objects .",
    "moreover , an additional factor of considerable importance is the formation of grains . in this paper",
    ", we address the spectroscopy and opacities of the molecules and atoms central to an understanding of substellar objects .",
    "such opacities are required for models of their spectra and evolution .",
    "another consequence of the emergence of this young field is the extension of the spectral classification system beyond late - type m - dwarf stars to include two new spectroscopic classes at lower temperatures , l and t dwarfs .",
    "the criteria for these new classes depend upon the strengths of atomic and molecular spectral lines , which in turn are governed by absorption cross sections and the abundances of various species .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the methods used to calculate opacities from extant line lists or by directly calculating the energy levels .",
    "the absorption due to spectral lines is the most important source of opacity , as well as the most difficult to calculate , and this is considered in  [ lines ] . after dealing with the background theory for calculating line strengths and broadening , and how to handle a frequency grid that samples the lines , we review the chemical species used for calculating substellar atmospheres .",
    "these are grouped together when they share important similarities , such as being metal hydrides or absorbing in the same general part of the spectrum .",
    "table 1 lists the species considered in this work and gives the sections where the species are discussed in detail , including several condensates addressed with the mie theory .    in  [ hitran ]",
    ", we discuss the species with data obtained from the hitran ( rothman et al .",

    "1999 , 2003 , 2005 ) databases , together with other sources .",
    "the spectral range covered is the visible and infrared .",
    "the molecules considered in detail are @xmath1 ( partridge & schwenke 1997 ; barber et al .",

    "2003a ) , and @xmath14 ( leininger & jeung 1995 ) , which all have similar properties .",
    "as much as possible , the most extensive and up - to - date spectroscopic data available are considered . in the case of @xmath5 and @xmath6 ,",
    "tables of precomputed opacities can be used , so calculations are restricted to interpolating in the ranges of temperature and pressure in the tables , but since these species have low abundances , they are relatively unimportant .",
    "ultraviolet opacities are important when a planet is irradiated by the star it orbits , and in  [ uvopac ] we discuss these opacities for atomic hydrogen ( menzel 1969 ; bethe & salpeter 1957 ; carson 1988a ) , atomic iron ( kurucz 1995 ) , and the molecules @xmath0 , @xmath3 , @xmath15 , @xmath1 ( kurucz 1993 ) , and @xmath5 ( lee , wang & suto 1987 ) . the available data vary considerably , and this dictates the methods used to calculate the opacities .",
    "the absorption of the alkali elements in monatomic form : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 using the vienna atomic line data , ( vald - piskunov 1994 ) is considered in ",
    "the line strengths and widths are all calculated in a uniform way , except for the wings of the resonance lines of @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( burrows & volobuyev 2003 ; allard et al .",
    "2003 ; zhu , babb , & dalgarno 2006 ) , for which a separate treatment should be applied .",
    "in addition to lines , the absorption due to the underlying continuum is calculated , as discussed in  [ continuous ] .",
    "rosseland and other harmonic mean opacities are divergent if the absorption drops to zero at any point in the frequency region considered , and a realistic truncation of the wings of spectra lines is required .",
    "the four processes discussed are free - free , bound - free , collision - induced absorption in the gas phase , and grain absorption by condensed phases .    for the temperatures and pressures of interest , free - free opacity sources are the least important ,",
    "so are only briefly covered in ",
    "[ freefree ] , since they can make at most a minor contribution at the upper end of the temperature range of interest .",
    "we discuss a number of free - free opacity sources , but in practice the only ones of even minor importance are @xmath21 ( carson 1988a ) , @xmath22 ( wishart 1979 ) , @xmath23 ( bell , berrington & croskery 1982 ) , and @xmath24 ( bell 1980 ) .",
    "we adopt the convention of including the free electron in the net charge of the whole system undergoing photon absorption , so here @xmath21 refers to an electron moving in the field of a proton , and @xmath22 refers to an electron moving in the field of a neutral hydrogen atom , and likewise for the other species .    of considerably greater importance is bound - free absorption , as discussed in ",
    "[ boundfree ] .",
    "we calculate the contribution due to @xmath25 with gaunt factors from carson ( 1988a ) , its negative ion @xmath26 ( wishart 1979 ; bell & berrington 1987 ) , and the atomic species @xmath17 ( cunto & mendoza 1992 ; cunto et al . 1993 ) , @xmath18 ( verner & yakovlev 1995 ) , and @xmath27 ( kurucz 1995 ) .",
    "the ion @xmath26 is important only when there is a supply of free electrons , and this is the case only when the species with the lowest ionization potentials , namely the alkali elements , become ionized .    at high pressures , collision - induced absorption , as discussed in  [ ciaopac ] , can be very important in the infrared . in an astrophysical mixture for the temperatures of interest to us here ,",
    "the two most important contributions are due to @xmath28 ( borysow et al .",
    "1985 ; zheng & borysow 1995a ; zheng & borysow 1995b ; borysow & frommhold 1990 ; lenzuni , chernoff , & salpeter 1991 ; guillot et al .",

    "although the contribution to the opacity due to @xmath30 collisions is much weaker , @xmath2 is an important molecule and the data are available .",
    "the detailed discussion of opacity calculations is completed in  [ grainopac ] by calculating mie scattering due to grains formed by the condensation of species out of the gas phase ( van de hulst 1957 ; sudarsky 2002 ) .",
    "both the real and imaginary components of the refractive indices are needed and used .",
    "once all the individual opacity sources have been calculated , they must be weighted by abundances and combined into monochromatic opacities or suitable mean opacities , as discussed in  [ total ] .",
    "for the abundances calculated in  [ atmosabun ] , suitable thermodynamic data are required , and methods of handling them are discussed . once the abundances are used to derive the total monochromatic opacity , rosseland and planck mean opacities can be calculated , if desired .",
    "the sources of opacities of greatest interest are bound - bound transitions of atoms and molecules , and are the main focus of this paper .",
    "these involve the greatest computational efforts , and often influence most strongly the computation of model atmospheres of brown dwarfs and giant planets .",
    "such transitions involve the absorption of a photon by an atom or molecule in the ground state , or a discrete initial excited state , to a more excited state , giving rise to a set of spectral lines , whose frequencies , strengths , and widths have to be calculated .    for some atoms , notably the alkali elements , there are only a few strong lines and a relatively modest number of weak lines that need to be considered . for other elements , such as iron ,",
    "there are a large number of lines . for molecules",
    "the number of lines that need to be considered can be very large indeed , often numbered in the millions , hundreds of millions , or billions , which require a significant amount of computing in order to calculate the opacity .",
    "all the gaseous species down to @xmath14 in table 1 contribute line absorption , with the exception of the @xmath26 ion , which has no lines , and @xmath31 which has no lines of importance in the spectral regions of interest .",
    "the calculation of the line strengths for each line of each species depends on the data available for the species being considered , so different methods have to be used , as discussed in  [ hitran ] ,  [ oxides ] ,  [ hydrides ] ,  [ uvopac ] , and  [ vald ] . in order to reduce the chances of errors with input data in different forms , it is recommended to convert , if necessary , all the line strengths into the same uniform system , with the best being integrated line strengths in @xmath32s@xmath33 species@xmath33 .",
    "these depend only on the temperature .",
    "the lines should then be broadened to a suitable profile which is dependent on the pressure , then the monochromatic absorption in @xmath32species@xmath33 across the profile should be computed , with the contributions from any overlapping profiles being summed .",
    "the monochromatic absorption for each species so obtained depends on the temperature and pressure .",
    "the total monochromatic opacity of the gas is obtained by summing up the individual contributions weighted by the abundances as number densities in @xmath34 for each of the species , yielding the total monochromatic volume opacity in @xmath32@xmath34 , i.e. cm@xmath33 ; however , the total monochromatic mass opacity in @xmath32g@xmath33 is usually the required result , and is obtained by dividing the volume opacity by the gas mass density .",

    ".    however , much of the data available are not expressed in the form of oscillator strengths and statistical weights , collectively given as @xmath49-values , but in other forms that must be converted to the required lines strengths ( see  [ hitran ] ) .",
    "the general expression for calculating the partition function is given by    @xmath50    where the summation is performed over the first @xmath51 levels , whose contributions are required at the highest temperatures of interest .",

    "formally the partition function is divergent , but for the pressures of interest , the higher levels that can cause this problem are not populated .",
    "however , because molecules contain a large number of energy levels , directly summing the levels is usually impractical and other methods should be used , depending on the data . for diatomic molecules ,",
    "a good approximation is to assume that the rotational , vibrational , and electronic contributions to the partition function can be separately evaluated for each electronic state , then combined by summing their products weighted by the boltzmann factor of each electronic state .",

    "as with the atoms , levels above about 20,000 cm@xmath33 contribute less than 1% to the partition function and , therefore , can be neglected .",

    "all states other than @xmath64 states contribute an additional factor of two .",

    "( [ molpart ] ) using the methods outlined above .",
    "expressions for calculating the partition functions of polyatomic molecules are in general very much more complicated , but with the available data in  [ hitran ] , only the partition functions of @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath4 are required . of these , that of @xmath2 is easily calculated by evaluating a formula , as given in  [ hitran ] . unlike the other molecules considered",

    "transitions between two given vibrational levels make up a band , which in turn is resolved into individual rotational lines that have to be calculated separately .",
    "if the @xmath49 values of these rotational lines are available , then eq . ( [ oscil ] ) can be used as above , but if they are not , the line strengths can still be calculated , provided an oscillator strength is available for either the band system , or the particular band being calculated",

    "note that the franck - condon factors are defined only for transitions between different electronic states , express the relative contributions to the band strengths due to the vibrational wavefunctions of the participating levels , and are normalized such that they sum to unity from a given @xmath81 to all possible values of @xmath82 , ( likewise , for the reverse transitions , assuming that the electronic oscillator strength is a constant over the system ) .",
    "in general , this will be a function of the frequencies of the band origins , and can be accounted for by using r - centroids , as first introduced by fraser ( 1954 ) , and subsequently used , by , for example , nicholls & jarmain ( 1956 ) , nicholls ( 1965 ) , and sharp ( 1984 ) .",
    "when such data are not readily available , and the variation of the electronic component of the oscillator strength over the band system is unknown , it could only be obtained by experiment or detailed quantum mechanical calculations .",
    "both of these are beyond the scope of our work , and the simplest assumption is to assume it is constant .",
    "this is justified by schadee ( 1967 ) , who provides a number of figures and expressions that show the variation of the electronic component of the band oscillor strength as a function of wavelength for one or more band systems of each of the molecules @xmath83 ,",
    "@xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 . with the exception of the red system of @xmath84 ( @xmath90 ) and possibly the schumann - runge system of @xmath89 ( @xmath91 ) ,",
    "these associated oscillator strengths vary by not much more than a factor of three at worst across the bands ; even the exceptions still vary by less than an order of magnitude . for polyatomic molecules",
    "a similar , though considerably more complicated , theory is in general involved , but data in forms suitable for direct opacity calculations are often available , as discussed in  [ hitran ] .",
    "many elements have several isotopes which can have a significant abundance .",
    "for example , the dominant isotope of titanium , @xmath92 , makes up about 74% of all isotopes of titanium , with four other isotopes making up the balance .",
    "the isotopic shifts of atomic lines are negligible , but are significant for molecules , and have to be considered for calculating line positions , though not for calculating partition functions ( see below ) .",
    "many datasets included line strengths and positions of isotopically substituted molecules , so no additional provisions have to be made .",
    "however , for those diatomic molecules which involve elements with significant fractions of minor isotopic species , and for which only data on the most abundant isotopic form are available , the isotopically shifted lines can be calculated .",
    "this can only be performed if the data for each transition include the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers of the participating states .    if @xmath93 and @xmath94 are , respectively , the reduced masses of the main isotopic version and an isotopically substituted version of the molecule , then given from herzberg ( 1950 )    @xmath95    the isotopic shifts of the harmonic , anharmonic and second - order anharmonic vibrational constants are , respectively , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , the rigid and non - rigid rotational constants are , respectively , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , and the first- and second - order vibration - rotation coupling constants are , respectively , @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the shifts of higher order constants , even when available , are neglected .",
    "this is because they make only a small correction to the energy levels . for multiplet states , various spin - orbit and spin - spin coupling constants ,",
    "again if they are available , are also neglected , and it is assumed that the levels are shifted by only the effects already mentioned .",
    "this is a higher order effect beyond the scope of this work , and is expected to have a small influence . with the isotopically shifted constants , together with the vibrational and rotational quantum number , the positions of the shifted energy levels can be calculated , and , thus , also the positions of the lines in the spectrum .",
    "the line strength are obtained by just multiplying the strength from eq.([stren ] ) by the fractional abundance of the isotope of the element .",
    "this is applied also to the main isotopic version of the molecule , if more than one are considered . in nearly all cases the main isotopic form of a molecule is more than an order of magnitude more abundant than the next most abundant isotopic form , so abundance effect dominates in the line strengths over other isotopic effects .",
    "the effects due to isotopically - shifted partition functions are generally only a few percent , and so are neglected .",
    "the line strengths will also be influenced by the changed wavefunctions due to the shifted energy levels of the participating states , but this is also expected to be small , as the isotopic shifts of energy levels are small compared to the depth of a typical internuclear potential well , whose shape is to a high order independent of the nuclear masses .",
    "even if the necessary data are available , calculating such wavefunctions is beyond the scope of this work and would provide at best a very marginal improvement in accuracy . in the case of homonuclear",
    "diatomic molecules , the line strengths also depend on the nuclear spins , and alternate between levels with even and odd parities ( herzberg 1950 ) . for nuclei with zero spin",
    ", alternate levels are missing .",
    "when one of the atoms is replaced by an isotope , the molecule becomes heteronuclear and this symmetry is lost .",
    "if both atoms are replaced by another isotope causing the molecule to be homonuclear again , the line strengths alternate with parity depending on the nuclear spins .",
    "thus , in the case of homonuclear molecules these effects have to be accounted for .",
    "the only homonuclear molecule considered in the opacity calculations in this work is @xmath0 , but deuterium is not discussed due to its low abundance . in the case of polyatomic molecules , the shifts are considerably more complicated to calculate , and most of the data on these molecules already include the isotopes . in situations where",
    "no isotopic data are given , no data on the levels involved in the transitions are given either .",
    "once the integrated line strength for a particular transition being considered has been obtained , including any isotopic versions of a molecule , its contribution to the monochromatic absorption has to be calculated .",
    "this requires the line to be broadened into a suitable profile , and the calculation of the absorption across each profile is the most intensive part of any calculation .    with the exception of the resonance lines of sodium and potassium ,",
    "a lorentzian profile should be used for all the broadening calculations . because of the generally high pressures and low temperatures , lorentzian broadening dominates over gaussian doppler broadening , so not employing general voigt profiles is justified , particularly when there are large uncertainties with broadening .",
    "accordingly , the monochromatic absorption in @xmath32species@xmath33 can be calculated using    @xmath103    where as before @xmath36 is the integrated line strength , @xmath104 is the normalization correction factor , @xmath105 is the velocity of light , @xmath106 is the lorentzian full - width at half - maximum in cm@xmath33 , and @xmath107 is the frequency of the line center in cm@xmath33 . if the profile is calculated out to large distances in the wings from the line center , then the normalization correction factor is unity . however , a major problem in calculating profiles is to know how to treat the far wings .",
    "if the wings are simply extrapolated out to large values of @xmath108 , the absorption is unrealistically large , and an excessive amount of computing time is used .",
    "as the absorption generally drops off in the far wings at a rate larger than a simple lorentzian profile , a suitable treatment in the absence of a detailed theory would be to cut off the profile at some distance @xmath109 from the line center , given by a simple presciption of the form @xmath110 cm@xmath33 , where @xmath111 is the total gas pressure in atmospheres .",
    "the @xmath112 function ensures that the lines do not become unrealistically broad .    because the profile is truncated at a distance @xmath109 from @xmath107 , in order to ensure that the total strength of the profile is conserved , the normalization correction factor @xmath104 in eq .",
    "( [ loren ] ) is greater than unity , and is given by    @xmath113    however , another problem occurs when the profiles are much narrower than the grid intervals , i.e. when @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the grid interval in cm@xmath33 , which is likely to happen at low pressures when the lines are very narrow . on average",
    ", most profiles will fall between grid points and only the far wings will be sampled , or even missed completely because of the truncation discussed above , so such profiles will be undersampled or not sampled at all . in these cases ,",
    "the line centers should be moved to the nearest grid point , but this will overcompensate and cause the lines to be overestimated in strength .",
    "this is because the profile is effectively replaced by a triangle whose apex is the profile s peak , which has a larger area than the original profile . in this case",
    ", the integrated strength causes the profile to appear to be too strong , so the normalization factor must reduce the total strength . after taking account of the small absorption in the two grid points immediately adjacent to the grid point at the center of the profile , the normalization factor used in eq .",
    "( [ loren ] ) is given by    @xmath116\\ , , \\label{corrbig}\\ ] ]    where in this case @xmath104 is less than unity and the criterion that @xmath117 is satisfied .",
    "in these cases , truncating the wings is done simply to avoid unnecessary computation , and the truncation is performed sufficiently far out in the wings so as not to affect eq .",
    "( [ corrbig ] ) , and if necessary may exceed the distance @xmath109 using the criterion based on the total gas pressure mentioned above . in the limit of very small widths , the contributions made by the two grid points adjacent to the profile s center become negligible , and the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ corrbig ] ) reduces to @xmath118 .",
    "the isotopic shifts of the energy levels of atoms are negligibly small ( typically , one part in ten thousand ) , and can be ignored . for the molecules ,",
    "the isotopic shifts can be significant , and can affect both the partition function and the spectral lines .",
    "however , the effect on the partition function is relatively small for the molecules of interest , as previously mentioned , and most molecules are dominated by one major isotope , so calculations can be simplified considerably by using only the partition function of the most abundant isotope for all isotopic forms . in the case of spectral lines",
    "the isotope effects need to be considered , and separate sets of shifted lines should be calculated for each isotopic version .",
    "many sources of line data already incorporate the isotopically shifted lines with their fractional abundances included with the line strengths , but when such data are not available , the isotopic shifts have to be specifically calculated ( see eq . [ rho ] ) .    in calculating models of brown dwarfs and extrasolar giant planets ,",
    "the monochromatic opacities produced by the species known to be important sources of absorption are required at the temperature and pressure at each level in the model . for an object relatively remote from its parent star where stellar irradiation is unimportant",
    ", the majority of the radiation is in the infrared , where molecules such as @xmath2 and @xmath1 have strong vibration - rotation ( and in the case of the latter also pure rotation ) absorption , but are relatively transparent in the visible and the near ultraviolet parts of the spectrum .",
    "this is because these molecules have stable closed electron shells , and only highly excited electronic states exist above the ground state . at the temperatures of interest the population of these levels is negligibly small , and transitions from the ground state to these excited states",
    "lie further in the ultraviolet , where the flux is neglibibly small , so ultraviolet opacities are unimportant . in the case of a substellar object orbiting close to its parent star , it can be irradiated at short wavelengths , which can affect its modeling , so ultraviolet opacities are required .    for those opacity sources that do not require much processing time",
    ", they can be calculated  on the fly \" as required .",
    "this includes all calculations of processes that produce continuous absorption , such as bound - free processes , those where the data can be obtained in the form of a smoothed absorption of a band system , and where a relatively small number of spectral lines have to be individually computed .    for those atomic and molecular species for which data are available containing millions of spectral lines",
    "that have to be individually computed , the processing time per thermodynamic point can be too long , of the order of 30 minutes on a modern computer with a processor speed of about 2 ghz , for them to be calculated on the fly .",
    "in these cases a good option is to generate a large number of files containing pre - computed monochromatic opacities for each species for a range of temperatures and pressures .",
    "then , interpolation can be performed at the time the opacities are required . a good choice would be to consider 50 logarithmic steps in temperature from 50 k to 3000 k , and 50 logarithmic steps in pressure from @xmath119 to @xmath120 atmospheres .",
    "each table would consist of monochromatic opacities in @xmath32 species@xmath33 over a range of wavenumbers .",
    "for those opacities important in the infrared , a suitable tabulation could be from 100 cm@xmath33 to 30,000 cm@xmath33 in steps of 1 cm@xmath33 ( 100 @xmath93 m to 0.33 @xmath93 m , respectively ) , which would include the visible part of the spectrum when data are available .",
    "for those that are important sources in the visible and ultraviolet parts of the spectrum , but not the infrared , the tabulation would cover a suitable range appropriate for the species ( see the discussion in section  [ uvopac ] ) , but starting from at least 10,000 cm@xmath33 ( 1 @xmath93 m ) in steps of 2 cm@xmath33 .",
    "the suggested tabulation intervals in temperature , pressure , and wavenumber represent realistic compromises to render the data as accurately as possible with a manageable amount of processing time and memory , and interpolations in temperature and pressure should be accurate to one part in 10@xmath121 or better . because opacities are usually confined to specific spectral regions , often with large sections of zero absorption on either side in the spectral range of interest , in many cases considerable disk space and processing time can be saved by noting the blank regions and not storing the zero data in these regions .",
    "this is particularly the case between the last non - zero grid point and 30,000 cm@xmath33 for the relevant infrared opacities .",
    "further savings can be made by not calculating and storing opacities of refractory species , such as @xmath8 , below 1000 k , as their abundances would be too small to be of any relevance . in such cases",
    "very short dummy files can be generated , and when the opacities are obtained by interpolation , zero values are handled very quickly without having to read in any data .",

    "specifically , this can be written as    @xmath122    where @xmath123 is the tabulated line strength in cm species@xmath33 in hitran or geisa format , and @xmath124 is the hitran or geisa reference temperature of 296 k. thus , @xmath125 is the partition function at that temperature .",
    "the term after the partition functions is the boltzmann factor , after taking account of the boltzmann factor at 296 k , and the last term is the stimulated emission correction factor , which has to allow for the correction factor at 296 k. isotopes , when relevant , are accounted for by their fractional abunadances already being included in @xmath123 , so no separate treatment is required .",
    "some of the datasets give the transition moment or the einstein a coefficient in addition to @xmath123 , but this is unnecessary , except as a check on the data .",

    "this can be very efficient , and not much would be gained in computing time by using larger temperature intervals at the expense of fewer temperature points covered . as the temperature decreases , the first appearance or disappearance of a condensed phase should be noted , in order to follow the condensation sequence with decreasing temperature . when a phase disappears with decreasing temperature",

    "in some cases at low temperatures it is possible for the code to converge to solutions where the element abundances or net charge neutrality are not valid , i.e. eq . ( [ balance ] ) does not balance .",
