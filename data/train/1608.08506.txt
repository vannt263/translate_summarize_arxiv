    "karl popper , _ the world of parenides _  for me , both philosophy and science lose all their attraction when they give up that pursuit [ of knowledge and understanding of the world ]  when they become specialisms and cease to see , and to wonder at , the riddles of our world .",
    "specialization maybe a great temptation for the scientist . for the philosopher",
    "it is the mortal sin . \"",
    "while the atomic theory of materials , proposed in the @xmath0 centurty bc by epicurus , leucippus and democritus @xcite has been embraced and experimentally verified , the question of the atomization ( i.e. , discretization ) of space - time ( s - t ) has received far less attention @xcite . even though the number of people who have studied s - t discretization is less",
    ", the group includes eminent philosopher - scientists such as ren descartes , isaac newton , gottfreid leibniz , george berkeley , david hilbert , werner heisnenberg , john a. wheeler and others - as excellently documented by amit hagar in @xcite . according to its proponents , a discrete s - t would entail space and time being built up from indivisible units , with space arrayed in a grid of unit cells of equal size ( or arrayed in an aperiodic tiling , such as penrose tiling @xcite ) , and time progressing in indivisible equal steps , as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : fig1 ] .",
    "it is widely believed however , that discrete s - t suffers from the following problems @xcite :    1 .",
    "[ problem1 ] lorentz contraction : the ostensibly smallest possible unit of length ( i.e. , @xmath1 ) in one inertial reference frame is lorentz contracted to yet smaller lengths in moving reference frames . 2 .   [ problem2 ]",
    "isotopy : discrete space will introduce preferred directions in space ; the motion of particles would be dependent on the direction of travel , even in matter - free space .",
    "3 .   [ problem3 ] causality : forces and acceleration on both sides of the incompressible fundamental spatial unit cell are experienced perfectly simultaneously ( i.e. , no time delay ) . this seemingly violates the postulates of special relativity ( sr ) and causality .",
    "4 .   [ problem4 ] nonconservation of energy and momentum : particles would be able to gain or lose momentum in units of @xmath2 .",
    "[ problem5 ] weyl tiles : in 1949 , hermann weyl claimed that if space is discrete , the length of the side of _ any size _",
    "square must be equal to its diagonal .",
    "this non - adherence to pythagoras s theorem is not observed , hence space must not be discrete @xcite .",
    "[ problem6 ]  jerkiness \" of motion @xcite : motion of a particle in discrete s - t occurs through discrete jumps from one grid point to the next - something thought to be unphysical @xcite .",
    "each single spatial jump ( of length @xmath1 ) occurs over one fundamental duration of time ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this jump is followed by several @xmath3s of duration where no jump occurs , and then followed by the next jump . during the jump ,",
    "the particle is presumably traveling at the speed of light @xmath4 .",
    "besides these problems , a discretized s - t must not predict any behavior that is at odds with what has already been physically measured .",
    "all current physical theories are built upon the continuous - space model and have been fantastically successful in describing practically all observed physical phenomena , from the structure of the atom to the motion of planets and stars . however , there are a few physical phenomena that are unexplained by conventional continuous - space - based physics , as well as some lingering philosophical issues :    1 .",

    "[ problem9 ] constancy of the speed of light : velocity is determined by measurements of position and temporal duration .",
    "why is it then , that a particular velocity , namely @xmath5 ( @xmath6 m / s ) , is elevated to the status of a sacrosanct constant of nature and not its foundational quantities of spatial and temporal intervals ? 4 .",
    "[ problem10 ] absolute versus nonabsolute space : does any aspect of space exist independent of matter ? 5 .",
    "[ problem11 ] time : is the time used by scientists ( namely ,  measured time \" ) the only time , or does a separate  time \" exist , namely henri s bergson s  real \" or  psychological \" time @xcite ?",
    "a few preliminary notes on problems [ problem7]-[problem11 ] are warranted at this point . concerning problem [ problem7 ] , despite many decades of work ,",
    "the unification of quantum mechanics ( qm ) and gravity remains unresolved , as well as explanations of inertial anomalies of some astronomical bodies .",
    "all approaches being studied ( e.g. , string theory , m - brane theory ) use continuous s - t and absolute or pseudo - absolute s - t .",
    "this is seen by qm s use of space and time differentials , general relativity s ( gr ) assumption of the existence of s - t even in the absence of all particles @xcite , and the fact that gr allows absolute rotations ( of the whole universe ) @xcite .",
    "we do not presume to unify qm with gr in this work , but we do show that there may be straightforward explanations for the inertial and gravitational anomalies of astronomical bodies ( see section [ sec : leopoldcrystal ] ) .",
    "issues [ problem8]-[problem11 ] pertain to space , time , measurement , and the quantization of measurables .",
    "concerning space , time and other measurables , most scientists and philosophers believe that the infinitesimally small or infinitesimally large do not exist in nature @xcite , whether it be of energy , momentum , spin or any other measurable quantity .",
    "however , beliefs and opinions have no place in science .",
    "thus the discretization of s - t needs to either be demonstrated using existing postulates and theories , or form a new , more fundamental set of postulates from which existing accepted postulates of physics can be derived , or are mere consequences . in this work",
    "we do both .    in this paper",
    ", we take popper s advice to heart ; we do not specialize and use tools from just one narrow philosophical or scientific field to address the nature of discrete s - t , but draw from humanity s rich tool - chest of knowledge that includes epistemology , quantum mechanics , special and general relativity , solid - state physics and mathematics . the rest of this paper is organized in seven sections .",
    "section [ sec : mach ] provides an outline of a deductive proof of s - t discretization , starting from existing and widely accepted scientific and philosophical theories .",
    "one reason for only an outline of a proof is that exact values of the space and time quantums are not necessary in addressing the main focuses of this paper : pythagoras s theorem , lorentz transformations and motion in discrete s - t , philosophical implications concerning time and duration , and the inertial anomalies of massive particles .",
    "goethe provides inspiration for the second reason when he stated ",
    "the greatest art in theoretical and practical life consists in changing the problem into a postulate ; that way one succeeds \" @xcite .",
    "thus , after developing the proof , we elevate s - t discretization to the status of a postulate . along with two postulates used in the proof , the complete set of postulates",
    "are :    1 .",
    "[ postulate1 ] logical positivism ( lp ) is the correct philosophy pertaining to the nature of existence and reality , and physical probes are required to perform a measurement ( championed by david hume , george berkeley , albert einstein and others @xcite ) .",
    "2 .   [ postulate2 ] space and time are non - absolute ( the foundation of mach s principle @xcite ) .",
    "3 .   [ postulate3 ] space and time are quantized , or discretized ( first considered by paramides and zeno @xcite and later more explicitly by mainonides @xcite ) .",
    "the proof in section [ sec : mach ] makes the more conservative assumptions of postulate [ postulate1 ] and [ postulate2 ] only , and then uses these to demonstrate the validity of postulate [ postulate3 ] .",
    "we do so because it is enlightening and useful ( for later parts of this paper ) to work through this demonstration that describes concepts of measurement , distance , the nature of reality , and the consistency of s - t quantization with , and its naissance from qm , gr and lp . in section [ sec : pointmap ] , a description is given of how continuous space is an artificial mathematical construct in which to more easily obtain solutions to physical problems , and how to map coordinates of continuous space to coordinates of discrete space .",
    "then in section [ sec : weyl ] , a new solution is developed to the weyl - tile argument that historically has been the unassailable argument against discrete space . in section [ sec : potpourri ] , resolutions are given for problems [ problem2 ] , [ problem3 ] , [ problem6 ] , [ problem8 ] , [ problem9 ] .",
    "section [ sec : lorentz ] contains a discussion on how to calculate @xmath7 assuming discretized s - t , and this model s impact on time dilation and length contraction .",
    "also in this section is a discussion of how discrete s - t allows for particles with nonzero rest mass to temporarily travel at the speed of light .",
    "section [ sec : time ] contains a discussion of light - clocks with the conclusion that light - clocks with different  tick - tock \" rates experience different amounts of time dilation and other irregularities , but in ways that ensure agreement amongst sets of light - clocks .",
    "thus , as henri bergson suspected , einstein s ideal light - clock is not as ideal as once thought @xcite .",
    "while bergson may have been right in that regard , it is ironic that we find that the scientists measured time is more in line with what bergson had in mind for his  psychological \" or real  time \" , and that the only candidate for bergson s immutable time is the atom of time itself ( a duration on the order of @xmath8 s ) that has little or no impact on the daily lives or perceptions of humans . in section [ sec : leopoldcrystal ]",
    ", descriptions are given of physical effects that can be measured and used to verify and quantify properties of discrete s - t .",
    "these effects include the the possibility of an inertial mass @xmath9 of an object ( how a particle accelerates due to an applied force ) that is different than the gravitational mass @xmath10 ( how much gravity a particle produces ) , with @xmath9 even being _ negative _ under certain circumstances .",
    "martin heidegger , _ being and time _  in this way , that [ the question of being ] which the ancient philosophers found continually disturbing as obscure and hidden has taken on a clarity and self - evidence that if anyone continues to ask about it he is charged with an error of method . \"    philosophers have debated for thousands of years about the acquisition of knowledge , measurement and being , and the nature and proof of existence . as we shall see in this work , these issues are not just abstract philosophical concepts devoid of any physical consequences , but play a central role in our argument for a discretized s - t , with this discretization leading to measurable effects on the motion of massive particles .",
    "even though heidegger was discussing the question of being from an ontological perspective in his statement , as opposed to the epistemological perspective taken in this work , we both agree that contemporary scientists should not eschew philosophy , but embrace it and integrate its concepts within their scientific works and theories .",
    "the philosophical school of thought called empiricism , and is off - shoot logical positivism ( lp ) , connect measurement to existence (  what can not be measured , _ ipso facto _ , does not exist \" @xcite ) .",
    "this measurement - being definition can be misinterpreted to mean that whatever can not be measured with existing technology does not exist",
    ". however , the proper interpretation of lp is : whatever can _ never _ be measured by _ any _ observer , regardless of how advanced one s technology , does not exist .",
    "this is the view taken in this paper .",
    "note that the results of this section are themselves not entirely new ; it is generally known that the quantums of space and time are on the order of the planck length ( @xmath11 m ) and planck time ( @xmath12 s ) respectively .",
    "however , a clear step - by - step demonstration of this seems to be lacking in the literature .    to calculate the shortest distance of space",
    ", we first have to review how one measures distances .",
    "einstein instructed us that two probe - particles and a light - pulse ( that serves as a signal - particle ) are needed when measuring a distance in space ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) @xcite . because any larger distance will be built up from multiples of the fundamental length ( i.e. , the quantum of spatial distance ( @xmath1 ) ) , it is adequate to focus on what is the measurable _ minimum _ separation of these probe - particles , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "far into the future , technology may have advanced to such a degree that probe - particles can be made to be as precise and compact as nature allows .",
    "such probes may be elementary particles with the same mass @xmath13 but perform different functions .",
    "one probe ( @xmath14 ) emits and receives a signal - particle ( @xmath15 ) ( e.g. , a photon ) , with @xmath15 also being as spatially compact as possible .",
    "a separate and distinct probe ( @xmath16 ) reflects @xmath15 .",
    "the questions then are : how small can one make the probes ( and therefore how precisely can their positions be determined ) , and what is the minimum separation between their two centers ?",
    "this minimum separation will then be @xmath1 - a quantity called a  hodon \" by silberstein @xcite .            to estimate this minimum separation ,",
    "one requires that the probe - particles remain distinct ( i.e. , non - overlapping ) .",
    "if both probe - particles have the same mass @xmath13 , then the minimum required separation is given by the compton wavelength ( @xmath17 ) of the particles , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] . as for how small the probes can be : they have be of a size such that they are able to perform their assigned roles . hence , @xmath14 needs to be able to emit some type of signal - particle , therefore it must have a radius at least as large as the schwartzchild radius @xmath18 otherwise the particle would be a black hole from which no particle can escape .",
    "this emitted signal - particle must be reflected by @xmath16 ; this sets the minimum radius of @xmath16 to @xmath19 as well .",
    "equating @xmath20 and @xmath21 yields the mass of the probes and the minimum separation of the probes :    @xmath22    with @xmath23 kg and @xmath24 m as the planck mass and planck length respectively @xcite .    to determine the value of the quantum of time ( @xmath3 ) , usually called a chronon , assume that we have an elementary particle ( e.g. , @xmath14 of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] or [ fig : fig3 ] ) serving as part of a perfect  clock \" , with this particle emitting photons at perfectly regular intervals .",
    "these photons are received by another receiver - particle ( @xmath16 ) and analyzed . here",
    "; it is a receiver of @xmath15 as opposed to being a reflector of @xmath15 ] assume that the position of @xmath14 is known as precisely as qm allows , namely within a spherical volume of diameter @xmath20 .",
    "we use the time intervals between successive photons incident upon @xmath16 to define a unit of time ( i.e. , @xmath26 ) .",
    "however , due to the uncertainty in where within @xmath14 the photon is emitted ( namely anywhere within the clock s spherical volume ) , each  tick \" at the receiver can arrive either sooner or later than it ideally should ( in comparison to the case where @xmath14 is infinitely small ) , by an amount of time @xmath27 , where @xmath5 is the speed of light . to minimize this uncertainty , one would choose an emitter - particle with as small of @xmath20 as possible while having the photons still able to escape the clock .",
    "this leads to @xmath14 having a radius of @xmath28 , and the smallest measurable duration in time as :    @xmath29    one can argue that the values of the quantums of length and time may be somewhat different upon a more careful analysis of the processes of signal - particle emission , reflection and detection .",
    "for example , one may say that conservation of momentum would require @xmath14 and @xmath16 to be more massive than @xmath15 , such that @xmath15 can catch up to @xmath14 ( @xmath14 may experience recoil upon emission of @xmath15 ) on its return trip .",
    "also , the act of reflection and detection of @xmath15 may not be instantaneous with the arrival of @xmath15 , but may each require an additional @xmath30 of duration ; this would make the @xmath3 be @xmath31 instead of @xmath30 .",
    "however , whatever the value of @xmath3 is ultimately determined to be , the ratio @xmath32 must be @xmath5 . and ,",
    "as was said before , exact values of the quantums of space and time are not needed for the main focuses of this paper , what is needed is only a demonstration that minimums exist for these entities .    as was said in the introduction ,",
    "now that a deductive argument has been developed to justify discrete s - t , we make the significant step of elevating @xmath1 and @xmath3 to the status of fundamental constants of nature , rather than derived quantities .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , we only need to know how to treat space between pairs of particles , and this is clearly described in fig . [",
    "fig : fig3 ] .",
    "we then use this information to counter the weyl - tile argument against discrete space , derive a modified pythagoras theorem , and discuss all other matters in this paper .",
    "however , before moving on to these issues , a short discussion on the issue of mapping points from continuous space to discrete space is interesting , even if it is not entirely necessary for the rest of this work .    after showing that points in space have a nonzero size , one can follow two different paths .",
    "one path involves divorcing ourselves completely of the current prevailing view of space and time as the  arena \" in which particles interact ,  space is not a stage , which might be either empty or full , onto which things come and go \" @xcite .",
    "instead , one should view s - t as nothing more than a collection of spatial ( temporal ) separations between particles ( events ) , which themselves are just more quantum mechanical parameters within a system s wavefunction @xmath33 . and",
    "just like other quantum mechanical parameters ( e.g. , energy , spin , momentum ) , a system makes spatial transitions by a raising or lowering of this quantum parameter by a hodon .",
    "similarly for time , but presumably a system can only experience a raising ( not a lowering ) of the time parameter by a chronon .",
    "this viewpoint is gaining increased interest by the research community due to its elegance and simplicity @xcite , however this concept involves an extreme reevaluation of space and time , and many problems with this concept remain unresolved .",
    "another , more conservative path is to view continuous space as a  dual \" space of discrete space , with continuous space being a convenient but artificial space in which to solve problems .",
    "once solutions are obtained in this dual space , one must map these solutions to real space ( i.e. , discrete space ) .",
    "for example , in the field of crystallography , one typically performs calculations in reciprocal space ( the dual space of coordinate space ) to determine the allowed directions of x - ray scattering by a crystal @xcite .",
    "even though this viewpoint has some attractive aspects , it also has some problems .",
    "one of them is that there is not a _ single _ unambiguous mapping from continuous space to discrete space .",
    "there are different mappings for each pair of particles ; there are as many continuous - to - discrete space mappings as there are particle - pairs in the universe . once again",
    ", we do not have to subscribe to either of these viewpoints ; only the information in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] is necessary .",
    "in 1949 hermann weyl introduced what has come to be viewed as the definitive argument against discrete s - t @xcite .",
    "weyl s argument uses a construction ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) in which space is defined _ a priori _  namely , an absolute space laid out in a grid for all particles to reside within , and on which all measurements made .",
    "distances in this model are required to be some integer multiple of @xmath1 ; _ no fractional values of @xmath1 are allowed_. weyl maintained that the distance ( @xmath34 ) from the center of one tile ( tile a in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) to the center of the next tile ( tile b ) along the triangle s side , and the distance ( @xmath35 ) from the center of tile a to the center of tile c along the triangle s diagonal are equal : @xmath36 .",
    "if the concept of absolute space and weyl s conception of distances in discrete space are accepted , then the length of the side is equal to the length of the diagonal for a square of * any * size .",
    "weyl then states that because all measurements to date have yielded a length for the diagonal of a square to be a factor of @xmath37 longer than the length of the square s side , space can not be discrete .",
    "weyl s argument is unassailable , provided that his assumption of absolute space is valid .",
    "however , such an assumption is wrong , and mach s concept of non - absolute ( na ) space provides a refutation to weyl s argument and a path forwards towards a modified pythagoras s theorem .    ; _ no fractional values of @xmath1 are allowed_. thus the length of the diagonal is equal to the length of the side of the square , regardless of the size of the square . ]    , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the distance along the diagonal is equal to the lengths of the triangle s base and height .",
    "this is because only one jump of @xmath1 is needed along the diagonal for the sphere defining @xmath15 to partially overlap the sphere centered about @xmath39 , and therefore be at the same position in discrete space . ]",
    ", @xmath15 needs 4 jumps of @xmath1 along the diagonal such that its defining sphere overlaps the sphere defining point c. thus the length of the hypotenuse relative to the length of the sides is @xmath40 . ]",
    "our counter - argument starts by rejecting the first step in weyl s construction where he assumed absolute space and we instead assume na - space . in na - space ,",
    "a particle can jump in _ any _ direction as long as the magnitude of the jump is @xmath1 .",
    "we then construct a system to measure the distances of a square s side and diagonal .",
    "the system is composed of three particles @xmath14 , @xmath16 , @xmath41 at positions @xmath42 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 respectively , with @xmath14 , @xmath16 and @xmath41 able to emit , reflect or receive of a signal - particle @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ) .",
    "the particles @xmath14 , @xmath16 , @xmath41 , and @xmath15 all have diameters equal to @xmath1 .",
    "we first construct the smaller right triangle shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] such that the time ( duration ) between emission ( at @xmath42 ) @xmath43 reflection ( at @xmath38 ) @xmath43 reception ( at @xmath42 ) of @xmath15 is @xmath44 .",
    "by @xmath16 is instantaneous . ]",
    "( note that @xmath15 is only shown along the segment @xmath45 , but signal - particles also traverse the segments @xmath46 and @xmath47 when the measurement of these segments are performed . )",
    "this time duration corresponds to a length for the path @xmath34 of @xmath1 , the smallest length that is possible to measure .",
    "additionally , the system is constructed such that a similar measurement yields a length of @xmath1 for the path @xmath48 .",
    "thus the system is an isosceles right triangle with @xmath49 .",
    "however the length of the diagonal @xmath35 is _ not _ @xmath50 . a signal - particle emitted by @xmath14 ( centered about _ a _ ) towards @xmath41 ( centered about _",
    "makes its first discrete jump of @xmath1 and _ already _ , the sphere that specifies the position of @xmath15 overlaps with the sphere defining the position @xmath39 .",
    "hence , @xmath15 has _ arrived _ at @xmath39 , will be instantaneously reflected by @xmath41 , and will propagate back to @xmath14 ; a process that takes the same duration @xmath44 as compared with @xmath15 traveling the path @xmath14",
    "@xmath43 @xmath16 @xmath43 @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the lengths of the sides , all being @xmath1 , and thus pythagoras s theorem is violated .",

    "[ fig : fig6 ] , with @xmath54 as an integer denoting the jump number .",
    "when @xmath52 is within the sphere that defines the point c , then @xmath15 has arrived at position @xmath39 and interacted with @xmath55 .",
    "for the larger triangle with sides of length @xmath56 , @xmath57 jumps of @xmath15 are necessary for this to occur .",

    "figure [ fig : fig7 ] shows a plot of the lengths ( relative to @xmath1 ) of hypotenuses versus the lengths of the sides of isosceles right triangles .",

    "already , we see that this model contains several attractive properties :    1 .",
    "[ advantage 1 ] it fully embraces the concept of na - space , and maintains isotropy .",
    "[ advantage 2 ] measurements of lengths are performed in ways accepted by science and adhering to the tenets of lp .",
    "[ advantage 3 ] a single equation applies to all size scales and accommodates both pythagoras s theorem for any practical distance , and the requirement of discretized space ( i.e. , distances as integer multiples of @xmath1 ) .",
    "this result is quite simple , and in hindsight obvious .",
    "however , the results were obtained in a logical , step - by - step way that provides a strong foundation on which to base discussions of : motion in discrete space , modification of the lorentz transformations , time versus duration , and inertial anomalies of massive particles .",
    "note that alternative distance formulas ( i.e. , metrics ) have been proposed in the past .",
    "herman minkowski was proposed and studied several different metrics in the early @xmath71 century , the most well known of which is the taxicab ( or manhattan ) geometry @xcite .",
    "in fact , hermann weyl s tile argument is an example of the use of the chebyshev distance formula @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that bendegem proposed a solution to the weyl tile argument that has similarities to the solution described in this paper @xcite . in his work",
    ", he assumed that points and lines have finite extensions .",
    "he then postulated that the lengths of the triangle s sides and hypotenuse are given by the number of squares contained in the rectangle formed by the length to be measured and the finite  width of the line segment \" @xcite .",
    "he certainly was on a similar track compared to what is done in this paper , but  and this is not to imply that there is any deficiency in his excellent work  he did not couch the argument in the language of qm , gr and lp .",
    "in qm , one can construct a system such that it has one value ( from within a set of @xmath72 discrete or continuous values ) for a particular  measurable \" ( e.g. , energy , angular momentum , linear momentum , and position ) . such states are called eigenstates of that measurable , and can be expressed by the wave function @xmath73 ( i.e. , the eigenfunction ) , with @xmath74 . when operating on @xmath73 with the quantum mechanical operator associated with the measurable , the result is product of a value of the measurable ( i.e. , the eigenvalue ) and @xmath73 . a system can undergo a transition from one eigenstate to another , either spontaneously or in response to external stimuli .",
    "for example , niels bohr accurately described the spectrum of light emitted from a hydrogen atom by assuming that angular momentum ( @xmath75 ) is quantized in multiples of @xmath76 , such that an electron in a hydrogen atom can only make transitions from an initial eigenstate with @xmath77 to a final eigenstate with @xmath78 with @xmath79 with @xmath63 being a positive or negative integer .",
    "standard techniques have been developed that provide the probability that such quantum mechanical transitions occur over a certain period of time @xcite .",

    "similar phenomena ( e.g. , negative effective mass @xmath211 ) occur for a crystal with constituent particles all with this mass , compared to the case when @xmath207 ; therefore , we refer the reader to @xcite for a more detailed discussion of a gc of this type .",
    "instead , let us consider an interesting case where the constituent crystal particles are higgs bosons ( @xmath212 kg ) , configured in a cubic lattice with lattice constant @xmath213 .",
    "first , let us estimate the mass of elementary particles that would  feel \" the effects of the crystal as they travel within it .",
    "to do so , one would equate the kinetic energy term and the dominant potential energy term in eq . :",
    "@xmath214    the effects of the crystal most often manifest themselves at the bz boundary at @xmath215 . using this value of @xmath189 in eq .",
    ", one arrives at the following approximation for the mass ( @xmath186 ) of a particle that will interact strongly with the gc :    @xmath216    with @xmath217 and @xmath218 , eq .",
    "yields a value of 10.62 kg . ) will obliterate the crystal around the particle s trajectory . ]",
    "the band diagram and @xmath9 as functions of @xmath189 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig13 ] and [ fig : fig14 ] respectively .",
    "it is seen that @xmath9 can be significantly different than the gravitational mass @xmath186 , with it even being negative for various ranges of momenta .",
    "a negative @xmath9 would predict that a particle would accelerate in the opposite direction of the external force . in the case of the universe ,",
    "the cumulative gravitational force ( due to all planets , stars and galaxies ) is in a direction towards the  center \" of the universe .",
    "particles with a negative value of @xmath9 will be observed to be accelerating in the opposite direction , that is , away from the center of the universe  these particles will be  pushed \" by the  pull \" of gravity .",
    "this effect can be easily detected and measured using the latest telescopes .    instead of higgs bosons composing the crystal",
    ", we can investigate other candidate particles .",
    "for example , we could use either of the two commonly stated values for the vacuum energy density , namely @xmath219 j/@xmath220 @xcite and @xmath221",
    "j/@xmath220 @xcite , and calculate the corresponding mass @xmath180 ( via @xmath222 with @xmath223 ) of each constituent crystal particle assuming a lattice constant of @xmath1 . for @xmath224 , we obtain @xmath225 kg , and using this value in eq .",
    "we obtain @xmath226 kg . in this case",
    ", @xmath186 is approximately the mass of the entire universe ( as stated in @xcite ) , thus no particle with a realistic mass would ever feel the effects of this crystal . for @xmath221 j/@xmath220 , we obtain @xmath227 kg and @xmath228 kg ; particles of this mass scale are realistic , are described in @xcite , and can produce measurable physical effects .",
    "another interesting result of these calculations is that it predicts that black holes ( bhs ) are more complicated than widely believed .",
    "any current textbook on gr or astronomy states that bhs have only three properties : total mass , spin , and electric charge .",
    "however , the results in this paper predict that the distribution of the mass within the event horizon is very important in determining the bh s motion in response to external gravitational forces . consider two cases : case 1 with a 10.62 kg bh where all this mass is concentrated into the  singularity \" ( of volume @xmath229 ) ; and case 2 where the 10.62 kg mass is composed of a uniform distribution of particles over the bh s volume of @xmath230 , with @xmath231 m being nine orders of magnitude greater than @xmath1 . for case 1 ,",
    "@xmath9 may vary dramatically , as already described ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig14 ] ) . for case 2",
    "however , @xmath9 will always be equal to each constituent particle s gravitational mass because each particle that composes the bh has too little mass to  feel \" the effects of the gc .",
    "thus , by studying the inertial properties of a bh ( i.e. , how it responds to an external force ) , one can glean some knowledge of its internal structure .     kg traveling within a cubic gc composed of higgs bosons ( one per unit cell ) with lattice constant @xmath232 .",
    "nonparabolicity of the bands occur , which is indicative of a @xmath9 that varies with momentum @xmath189 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig14 ] .",
    "* inset : * one unit cell of reciprocal space showing the crystal directions . ]",
    "( blue line ) as a function of momentum @xmath189 of a particle ( with gravitational mass @xmath233 kg ) traveling within the gc of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig12 ] .",
    "the red dotted line is @xmath186 and the vertical dotted lines are bz boundaries .",
    "it is seen that away from the @xmath234-point , @xmath9 differs significantly from @xmath186 , with @xmath9 being much greater than @xmath186 , near zero , or even negative . ]",
    "in this work , the discretization of space and time was studied , along with its affects on mathematical and physical theories .",
    "first , using well accepted concepts within quantum mechanics and general relativity , and adhering to the tenets of logical positivism , the quantums of space and time were derived .",
    "next , using mach s principle of strict non - absolute space , a method was developed to map points from continuous space to discrete space . using these results , and again using concepts from quantum mechanics and mach s principle , a modified pythagoras s theorem ( leopold s theorem )",
    "was deduced .",
    "leopold s theorem agrees with the pythagoras s theorem at large size scales but differs from it at the planck scale , in such a way that it preserves the concept and requirements of discrete space - time .",
    "particle motion in discrete space - time was then described , and it was shown that the constancy of the speed of light is a consequence of the immutability of the quantums of space and time , and non - absolute space .",
    "these results were then used in the theory of special relativity to calculate a modified @xmath7 function that is a function of both speed and measurement duration .",
    "such results significantly alter time dilation and length contraction , as well as allowing particles ( even with nonzero rest mass ) to temporarily travel at the speed of light .",
    "the issue of the existence and nature of a  real \" immutable time was studied in the context of both logical positivism and the modified laws of special relativity developed in this work .",
    "it was seen that the only candidate for an immutable time was a single quantum of time , the chronon , and a single tick of a bergson clock .",
    "in contrast , scientists measured time preserves and contains within it the chronon , but it also is the  lived \" , the experienced , the psychological time important for practically all particle interactions and human experiences . finally , it was shown how the discretization of space imposes order on wheeler s quantum foam , turning it into a universe - wide gravity crystal that can affect the inertial properties of dense , high momentum particles such as black holes . by studying the inertial properties of black holes , some aspects of the mass - distribution within their event horizons can be gleaned .",
    "this work was spawned from more traditional metamaterial research performed at the national science foundation industry / university cooperative research center for metamaterials ( cfm ) ( iip-1068028 ) .",
    "my aim in @xcite was to order wheeler s foam and to treat it as a universe - wide metamaterial with a negative gravitational permeability , similar to what is done with optical metamaterials with their negative values for the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability .",
    "but during the course of doing so , i came across weyl s tile argument ; countering this argument was the initial focus of this work .",
    "i therefore acknowledge the cfm for providing the stimulus to extend the concepts and techniques of metamaterials and solid - state physics to gravity crystals and to a reassessment of pythagoras s theorem .",
    "of all the reference materials , two were the most significant in this work , and i feel compelled to acknowledge them : the engrossing books by amit hagar @xcite and jimena canales @xcite .",
    "finally , i would like to acknowledge leopold crouse for his insightful discussions on issues concerning motion in discrete space - time",
    ". he immediately alerted me to the relativistic velocity - dependent increase in mass , and that this would preclude the staccato nature of motion necessary in discrete space - time .",
    "these discussions ultimately led to one of the most important results in this work , namely , that @xmath7 is dependent on temporal duration .",
