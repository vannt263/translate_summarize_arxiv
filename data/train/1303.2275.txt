    "when electrons in a crystal band are driven by an external time - independent electric field , they move periodically across the brillouin zone , creating characteristic bloch oscillations . the frequency of the oscillations , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the unit cell size , coincides with the energy separation between neighboring states localized on a wannier - stark ladder @xcite .",
    "the effect has been observed for electrons / holes in semiconducting superlattices@xcite , for atoms trapped in a periodic optical potential@xcite , and for light propagating in a periodic array of waveguides , with gradient of the temperature or of the refraction index working as an effective electric field@xcite .",
    "combining the effects of a strong , time - periodic driving field , with the nonlinearity of the bloch oscillations leads to higher harmonic generation of the driving frequency@xcite .",
    "this effect has recently been observed in bulk zno crystals strongly driven by a few - cycle pulsed infrared laser@xcite .",
    "the application of the infrared field in short , 100-femtosecond , pulses was necessary to ensure that the absorbed energy could be transferred to the lattice and dissipated .    in this work , we suggest that frequency multiplication due to periodically - driven bloch oscillations could also be observed in a steady - state setting , e.g. , a periodically modulated nanowire ( or an array of such nanowires ) continuously driven by high - amplitude terahertz radiation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nanowire ] ) . in the weak - scattering limit , the quantum efficiency of frequency tripling for such a system can be as high as 93% .    for a nanowire in mechanical contact with an insulating , optically transparent substrate",
    ", a quasi - equilibrium electron distribution will be reached as the power absorbed from the driving field will be continuously dissipated into phonon modes .",
    "this distribution can be quite different from the initial , equilibrium fermi distribution .",
    "in particular , at the driving field amplitude which is optimal for third harmonic generation , the distribution can be both broadened and inverted .",
    "the inversion of the distribution occurs once the driving field amplitude exceeds the dynamical localization threshold@xcite .    in our analytic derivation , we combine the floquet quasi - energy description with the keldysh green s function technique to obtain the semiclassical master equation for a one - dimensional band of strongly and rapidly driven electrons in the presence of weak scattering by phonons .",
    "we solve these equations numerically to find the electron distribution function for a cosine energy band at a given driving field frequency ( fixed at @xmath2thz ) and the field amplitude chosen to suppress the generation of the principal harmonic .",
    "this electron distribution is used as an input for calculating the time - dependent current and the intensity radiated at different harmonics of the driving field frequency .",
    "we use these results to find the optimal dimensions of a periodically modulated inas / inp nanowire , which would yield the most efficient frequency tripling of @xmath3thz radiation .",
    "we consider a single - band one - dimensional metallic wire driven by a harmonic electric field with the amplitude @xmath4 and frequency @xmath5 , and coupled to substrate phonons , @xmath6 where the electron , electron - phonon , and phonon hamiltonians are , respectively @xmath7 here @xmath8 @xmath9 is the annihilation ( creation ) operator for an electron with one - dimensional momentum @xmath10 and energy @xmath11 . to apply our results to a periodically modulated nanowire , we assume a tight - binding model with the electronic spectrum , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the hopping matrix element and @xmath1 is the period of the potential along the chain .",
    "the electric field is incorporated into the hamiltonian through the vector potential @xmath14 with @xmath15 representing the vector potential of the driving field .",

    "the factors @xmath20 are the matrix elements for electron - phonon scattering .",
    "we ignore the effects of disorder or electron - electron interactions , and consider lattice phonons in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath21 .",
    "we do not include directly the scattering by phonon modes of the nanowire , assuming that they are strongly hybridized with those of the substrate , with the corresponding effects incorporated in the matrix elements @xmath22 .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling is considered to be weak , meaning that the phonon scattering time is long compared to the period @xmath23 of the driving field .",
    "the dynamics of the strongly - driven electrons with the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham - electron ] ) is characterized by non - monotonous phases @xmath24 the phase accumulated over a period , @xmath25 , can be expressed in terms of the average particle energy with the momentum @xmath10 , @xmath26 clearly , this energy can be also identified as the floquet energy of a single - electron state . while eq .",
    "( [ eq : average - energy ] ) does not include the usual additive uncertainty @xmath27 , this particular choice has the advantage that in the weak - field limit , @xmath28 , @xmath29 recovers the zero - field spectrum @xmath11 .",
    "the average energy  ( [ eq : average - energy ] ) also coincides with that introduced in the theory of dynamical localization@xcite .",
    "dynamical localization occurs when the effective band becomes flat , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "the corresponding condition is most easily obtained in the special case of tight - binding model with the spectrum  ( [ eq : tight - binding ] ) , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the zeroth order bessel function . with the driving field amplitude increasing from zero the bandwidth",
    "is gradually reduced ; it switches sign at the roots of the bessel function , @xmath33 .",
    "the first time this happens corresponds to the electric field @xmath34 , where @xmath35 .",
    "we obtain the instantaneous current by averaging the canonical velocity operator @xmath36 over the electron distribution function @xmath37 , @xmath38 where we assumed the tight - binding spectrum  ( [ eq : tight - binding ] ) and used the definitions @xmath39    in the limit of weak scattering , the distribution function @xmath40 is time- independent and always symmetric , @xmath41 .",

    "the fourier components of the current are obtained directly , @xmath44 where the summation is over the odd harmonics @xmath45 . by choosing @xmath46 , the first harmonic",

    "previously , related approaches have been used , e.g. , for describing ionization of atoms@xcite and the high - order harmonic generation@xcite in the field of ultrashort laser pulses . here , instead of solving the corresponding equations numerically , we take the limit of weak electron - phonon coupling and",
    "analytically derive the semiclassical master equation for electron distribution function averaged over the period of the driving field , see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : qke ] ) and ( [ eq : rates ] ) .",
    "the same master equation can also be derived from the formalism by konstantinov and perel@xcite with the help of an appropriate resummation of the perturbation series@xcite . in the interaction representation with respect to the time - dependent hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ham - electron ] )",
    ", the electron operators acquire time - dependence @xmath52 with quasiperiodic phases  ( [ eq : phases ] ) .",
    "we separate these phases by defining the `` lower - case '' gfs @xmath53 where the `` upper - case '' @xmath54 is any of the conventional gfs introduced in the keldysh formalism .",
    "these phases introduce rapid oscillations in the self - energy , making the direct wigner transformation difficult .",
    "we notice , however , that in the limit of weak electron - phonon coupling , the gfs ( [ eq : gf ] ) are expected to change only weakly when both time arguments are incremented by the driving period @xmath55 .",
    "this implies that in the following decomposition , @xmath56 @xmath57 is the `` fast '' time , while @xmath58 is the `` slow '' time when it appears as an argument of thus defined floquet components @xmath59 of the gf . the dyson equations for thus defined keldysh @xmath60 and retarded @xmath61 gfs@xcite have the form @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the collision integrals originating from the corresponding self - energy functions .",
    "the collision integrals being relatively small , both @xmath60 and @xmath61 are dominated by the @xmath65 components@xcite .    to derive the semiclassical master equation , we write the equations for the @xmath65 components of the `` lesser '' @xmath66 and `` greater '' @xmath67 gfs@xcite , perform the wigner transformation replacing the fast time variable @xmath68 by the frequency @xmath69 , and use a version of the kadanoff - baym approximation@xcite @xmath70 for the corresponding spectral function , @xmath71=2\\ , \\im g^r_{k,0}(\\omega , t)$ ] , where @xmath72 is the non - equilibrium electron distribution function averaged over the period .",

    "a periodically modulated inas / inp nanowire with the period @xmath89 nm , and the driving field frequency @xmath2thz , the emission of the first harmonic is suppressed with the dimensionless vector potential amplitude @xmath137 , which gives the electric field amplitude @xmath138v / m , corresponding to the energy flux of about @xmath139mwt/@xmath140 . at this kind of power , many effects could lead to eventual run - away overheating of the system , e.g. , direct absorption by the substrate , or even a relatively weak disorder scattering in the nanowire .",
