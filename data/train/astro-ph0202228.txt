    "discovering the process by which the dense , gravitationally bound galaxies formed in the universe from an initially almost uniform gas , and understanding the way their constituent populations of stars were born is a key goal of modern physical cosmology .",
    "a wide range of well understood physical processes are involved ; including general relativity , gas dynamics and cooling physics , nuclear reactions and radiative transfer .",
    "however , the range of possible initial conditions and the non - linear nature of most of the events , starting with the collapse of primordial density perturbations , ensure that these intimately connected processes can generate a very wide range of possible scenarios and outcomes .",
    "galaxy formation can be studied by attempting to reproduce the observed universe via analytical models and numerical simulations .",
    "the information required to constrain these models is provided by both forensic studies of the current constituents of the universe , including stellar ages , chemical abundances and the sizes and shapes of galaxies , and by direct observations of the galaxy formation process taking place in the young universe at great distances .",
    "direct observations exploit both the light emitted by distant galaxies , and the signature of absorption due to intervening structures along the line of sight , and began almost 50 years ago using sensitive optical and radio telescopes .",
    "astronomers must now use all available frequencies of radiation to probe the properties of the universe , from the lowest energy radio waves to the highest - energy @xmath0-rays .",
    "it is vital to combine the complementary information that can be determined about the constituents of the universe at different wavelengths in order to make progress in our understanding .",
    "this review discusses the results of a new type of direct observation of the galaxy formation process , made possible by the development of powerful new radiation detectors sensitive to wavelengths in the range 200@xmath1 m to about 1 mm : the submillimeter ( submm ) waveband .",
    "the detection of submm radiation from distant galaxies is one of the most recent developments in observational cosmology , and has finally brought this region of the electromagnetic spectrum into use for making cosmological observations not directly connected with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ; partridge and peebles ,  1967 ) . with the possible exception of the hardest x - ray wavebands , studies of distant galaxies in the submm waveband remained elusive for the longest period .",
    "we will also discuss some observations at the mid- and far - infrared(ir ) wavebands that bound the submm waveband at short wavelengths , usually defined as the wavelength ranges from about 540 and 40200@xmath1 m , respectively .",
    "the most significant reason for the late flowering of submm cosmology is the technical challenge of building sensitive receivers that work efficiently at the boundary between radio - type coherent and optical - like incoherent detection techniques .",
    "in addition , atmospheric emission and absorption permits sensitive submm observations from only high mountain sites , and only in specific atmospheric windows .",
    "the zenith opacity from the best sites in the clearest submm atmospheric window at 850@xmath1 m is typically about 0.1 .",
    "furthermore , the long wavelength of submm radiation limits spatial resolution unless very large filled or synthetic apertures are available .",
    "the largest single apertures available at present are in the 1030 m class , providing spatial resolution of order 10arcsec .",
    "this resolution is much coarser than the sub - arcsec resolution of optical and near - ir observations .",
    "the appearance of the same region of sky at optical and submm wavelengths is compared in fig.[fig : a1835 ] to illustrate this point : the multicolor optical image was obtained using the hale 5-m telescope at mt .",
    "palomar , while the 850-@xmath1 m submm image was obtained using the 15-m james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) on mauna kea .",
    "interferometers can dramatically enhance the resolution of images , but so far have only operated at longer mm wavelengths .",
    "the commissioning of the 8-element sub - millimeter array ( sma ; ho , 2000 ) on mauna kea in hawaii with baselines of up to about 500 m , the first dedicated submm - wave interferometer , will provide images with subarcsecond resolution .",
    "the much larger 64-element atacama large millimeter array ( alma ; wootten , 2001 ) will be in service at the end of decade .",
    "a key development was the commissioning of the submillimetre common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) camera at the jcmt in 1997 ( holland et al . ,  1999 ) .",
    "scuba images the sky in the atmospheric windows at both 450 and 850@xmath1 m in a 2.5-arcmin - wide field , using hexagonal close - packed arrays of 91 and 37 bolometer detectors at the respective wavelengths .",
    "scuba provided a dramatic leap forward from the pre - existing single - pixel or one - dimensional array instruments available .",
    "the combination of field of view and sensitivity was sufficient to enable the first searches for submm - wave emission from previously unknown distant galaxies .",
    "the max - planck millimetre bolometer array ( mambo ; kreysa et al . ,",
    "1998 ) is a 1.25-mm camera with similar capabilities to scuba , which operates during the winter from the institut de radio astronomie millimtrique ( iram ) 30-m telescope on pico veleta in spain . a similar device  the sest imaging bolometer array ( simba)designed at onsala in sweden is soon to begin operation on the 15-m swedish  eso submillimetre telescope ( sest ) in chile , providing a sensitive submm imaging capability in the south .",
    "the capability of mm and submm - wave observatories is not standing still : a number of larger , more sensitive mm- and submm - wave cameras are under construction , including the sharc - ii ( dowell et al . ,   2001 ) , bolocam ( glenn et al . ,  1998 ) and scuba - ii instruments .. the next - generation scuba - ii camera for the jcmt is under development at the united kingdom astronomy technology centre ( ukatc ) .",
    "see http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/jacpublic/jcmt/continuum_ observing / scuba-2/home.html . ]",
    "bolometer technology continues to advance .",
    "the advent of extremely stable superconducting bolometers that require no bias current and can be read out using multiplexed cold electronics , should ultimately allow the construction of very large submm detector arrays of order @xmath2 elements ( for example benford et al . ,  2000 ) .",
    "scuba - ii is likely to be the first instrument to exploit this technology , providing a @xmath3-arcmin@xmath4 field of view at the resolution limit of the jcmt .",
    "the first extragalactic submm / mm surveys using scuba and mambo revealed a population of very luminous high - redshift galaxies , which as a population , were responsible for the release of a significant fraction of the energy generated by all galaxies over the history of the universe ( blain et al .",
    ",  1999b ) .",
    "almost 200 of these galaxies are now known ( smail et al . ,  1997 ; barger et al . ,  1998 ; hughes et al .",

    "there is strong evidence that almost all of these galaxies are at redshifts greater than unity , and that the median redshift of the population is likely to be of order 23 ( smail et al . ,  2000 , 2002 ) .",
    "however , only a handful of these objects have certain redshifts and well - determined properties at other wavelengths ( frayer et al . ,  1998 , 1999 ; ivison et al . ,   1998 , 2001 ;",
    "kneib et al . ,",
    "the results of these mm / submm surveys provide complementary information to deep surveys for galaxies made in the radio ( richards , 2000 ) , far - ir ( puget et al . ,  1999 ) , mid - ir ( elbaz et al . ,   1999 ) and optical ( steidel et al . ,  1999 ) wavebands .",
    "submm observations are a vital component of the search for a coherent picture of the formation and evolution of galaxies , which draws on data from all wavebands where the distant universe can be observed .    in this review ,",
    "we describe the key features of the submm emission processes in galaxies .",
    "we summarize the current , developing state of submm - wave observations of distant galaxies , including the results of both blank - field surveys , and targeted observations of known high - redshift galaxies , including radio - galaxies , optically - selected quasars / qsos , x - ray detected active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and optically - selected lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) .",
    "submm - wave surveys are not immune to selection effects , and we discuss their strengths and weaknesses .",
    "we describe the properties of the class of submm - luminous galaxies , and discuss the key results that are required to make significant progress in understanding them .",
    "we consider the relationship between the submm - selected galaxies and other populations of high - redshift galaxies , and describe models that can account for the properties of submm - selected galaxies .",
    "we introduce the unusually significant effects of the magnification of distant submm - selected galaxies due to gravitational lensing ( schneider et al . ,  1992 ) .",
    "finally , we recap the key developments that are keenly awaited in the field , and describe some of the exciting science that will be possible in the next decade using future instruments .    the cosmological parameter values assumed are generally listed where they appear .",
    "we usually adopt a flat world model with a hubble constant @xmath5kms@xmath6mpc@xmath6 , a density parameter in matter @xmath7 and a cosmological constant @xmath8 .",
    "there are two major sources of submm radiation from galaxies : thermal continuum emission from dust grains , the solid phase of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and line emission from atomic and molecular transitions in the interstellar gas .",
    "the ladder of carbon monoxide ( co ) rotational transitions , spaced every 115ghz , is the most important source of molecular line emission , but there is a rich zoo of other emitting molecules in the denser phases of the ism .",
    "submm surveys for distant galaxies have so far been made using cameras that detect only continuum dust emission , and so this will be the main focus of this review .",
    "however , the search for line emission is already important , and its study will become increasingly significant .",
    "the spectral resolution provided by line observations reveals much more about the physical and chemical conditions in the ism , for studies of kinematics , metallicity and excitation conditions .",
    "molecular lines can also be used to obtain a very accurate spectroscopic redshift for the ism in high - redshift galaxies with prior optical redshifts ( for example frayer et al . ,  1998 ) .",
    "searches for redshifts at cm and ( sub)mm wavelengths using co lines will be possible using future telescopes .    the best studied regions of the universe in the submm waveband are giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) in the milky way , in which ongoing star formation is taking place ( hollenbach and tielens , 1997 ) .",
    "gmcs are perhaps very low - luminosity archetypes for distant dusty galaxies , although these galaxies have far - ir luminosities that are up to 4 orders of magnitude greater than that of the whole milky way .",
    "detailed , resolved submm - wave images and spectra only exist for low - redshift galaxies ( for example regan et al . ,  2001 ; sakamoto et al . ,   1999 ) , and it is often necessary to use them as templates to interpret the properties of more distant galaxies .",
    "a very important class of well - studied galaxies similar in luminosity , and perhaps in physical properties , to high - redshift submm galaxies are the ultraluminous ir galaxies ( ulirgs ) discovered in the _ infrared astronomy satellite ( iras ) _ all - sky survey in the mid 1980 s ( see the review by sanders and mirabel , 1996 ) .",
    "ulirgs are usually defined as having a bolometric luminosity , integrated over all wavelengths at which dust emission dominates the sed ( from about 1mm8@xmath1 m ) , in excess of @xmath9l@xmath10 .",
    "= @xmath11w ] they are amongst the most luminous of all galaxies , but number less than 0.1% of galaxies in the local universe . due to their selection by _ iras",
    "_ , they are typically at relatively low redshifts , less than about 0.3 . the first _ iras_-detected high - redshift ulirg was identified by rowan - robinson et al .",
    "( 1991 ) at @xmath12 .",
    "the current record redshift for a galaxy detected by _ iras _ is @xmath13 for apm08279 + 5255 ( irwin et al . ,  1998 ) .",
    "both these galaxies appear to be extremely luminous ; however , their luminosities are boosted by at least a factor of ten due to gravitational lensing by foreground galaxies .",
    "a compilation of the properties of some of the most extreme ulirgs is given by rowan - robinson ( 2000 ) .",
    "the ir spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of some low - redshift ulirgs and a compilation of results for the more sparsely sampled seds of high - redshift dusty galaxies are illustrated in fig.[fig : sed ] .",
    "about 99% of the energy released by galaxies in the submm and far - ir wavebands is produced by thermal emission from dust grains ; the remainder comes from fine - structure atomic and molecular rotational line emission .",
    "however , the source of the energy to power this emission by heating dust is often unclear . any intense source of optical / ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation , either young high - mass stars or an accretion disk surrounding an agn , would heat dust grains .",
    "because dust emits a featureless modified blackbody spectrum , submm continuum observations can reveal little information about the physical conditions within the source .",
    "regions of intense dust emission are very optically thick , and so little information can be obtained by observing optical or uv radiation .    in typical spiral galaxies , with relatively low far - ir luminosities of several 10@xmath14l@xmath10 ( for example alton et al . ,  2000 , 2001 )",
    ", the dust emission is known to be significantly extended , on the same scale as the 10-kpc stellar disk.m ] the emission is certainly associated with molecular gas rich star - forming regions distributed throughout the galaxy ( regan et al . ,  2001 ) , in which dust is heated by the hot , young ob stars .    in intermediate luminosity galaxies , such as the interacting pair of spiral galaxies",
    "ngc4038/4039 ` the antennae ' ( mirabel et al . ,  1998 ; wilson et al . ,  2000 ) , the most intense knots of star - formation activity , from which most of the luminosity of the system emerges , are not coincident with either nucleus of the merging galaxies , but occur in a deeply dust - enshrouded overlap region of the ism of the galaxies .",
    "this provides a strong argument that almost all of the energy in this system is being generated by star formation rather than an agn .    in more luminous ulirgs",
    "that are at sufficiently low redshift for their internal structure to be resolved , the great majority of the dust emission arises in a much smaller , sub - kpc region ( downes and solomon , 1998 ; sakamoto et al . ,  1999 ) within a merging system of galaxies .",
    "it is plausible that a significant fraction of the energy could be derived from an agn surrounded by a very great column density of gas and dust that imposes many tens of magnitudes of extinction on the emission from the agn in the optical and uv wavebands , and which remains optically thick even at near - ir wavelengths .",
    "alternatively , an ongoing centrally condensed burst of star - formation activity , fueled by gas funneled into the center of the potential well of a pair of interacting galaxies by a bar instability ( mihos , 2000 ) is an equally plausible power source .",
    "if the geometry of absorbing and scattering material is known or assumed , then radiative transfer models can be used to predict the sed of a galaxy , which should differ depending on whether the source of heating is a very small agn with a very hard uv sed , or a more extended , softer - spectrum nuclear star - forming region ( for example granato et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "note that the results are expected to be very sensitive to the assumed geometry ( witt et al . ,",
    "1992 ) . in merging galaxies",
    "this geometry is highly unlikely to be spherical or cylindrical , and is uncertain for the high - redshift galaxies of interest here . in the case of agn heating ,",
    "the sed would be is expected to peak at shorter wavelengths and the mid - ir sed would be expected to be flatter as compared with a more extended star - formation power source .",
    "both these features would correspond to a greater fraction of hot dust expected in agns ( see fig.[fig : sed ] ) , and is seen clearly in the seds of low - redshift _ iras_-detected qsos ( sanders and mirabel , 1996 ) .",
    "an alternative route to probing energy sources in these galaxies is provided by near- and mid - ir spectroscopy . at these longer wavelengths ,",
    "the optical depth to the nucleus is less than in the optical / uv , and so the effects of the more intense , harder uv radiation field expected in the environs of an agn can be observed directly .",
    "these include the excitation of characteristic highly - ionized lines , and the destruction of relatively fragile polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules ( rigopoulou et al .",
    ",  1999 ; laurent et al . ,  2000 ; tran et al . ,  2001 ) , leading to the suppression of their distinctive emission and absorption features .",
    "mid - ir spectroscopic observations with the successor to _ iras _ , the _ infrared space observatory ( iso ) _ in the mid 1990 s indicated that most of the energy from low - redshift ulirgs is likely generated by star - formation activity rather than agn accretion",
    ". however , the fraction of ulirgs containing agn appears to increase at the highest luminosities ( sanders , 1999 ) .",
    "this could be important at high redshifts , where the typical luminosity of dust - enshrouded galaxies is greater than in the local universe .",
    "in addition , there may be duty - cycle effects present to make an agn accrete , and perhaps to be visible , for only a fraction of the duration of a ulirg phase in the evolution of the galaxy ( kormendy and sanders , 1988 ; sanders et al .",
    ",  1988 ; archibald et al . ,  2002 ) .",
    "x - ray observations also offer a way to investigate the power source , as all but the densest , most gas - rich galaxies , with particle column densities greater than @xmath15@xmath16 are transparent to hard ( @xmath17kev ) xrays .",
    "ultra - high - resolution radio observations provide a route to probing the innermost regions of ulirgs ( smith et al . ,  1998 ; carilli and taylor , 2000 ) .",
    "by detected the diffuse emission and multiple point - like radio sources , expected from multiple supernova remnants , rather than a single point - like core and accompanying jet structures expected from an agn , these observations suggest that high - mass star formation contributes at least a significant part of the luminosity of the ulirgs arp220 and mrk273 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the observed correlation between the inferred mass of the black holes in the centers of galaxies and the stellar velocity dispersion of the surrounding galactic bulges , in which most of the stars in the universe reside ( fukugita et al . , 1999 ) , might inform this discussion ( magorrian et al .",
    ",  1998 ; ferrarese and merritt , 2000 ; gebhardt et al . ,  2000 ) .",
    "the mass of the bulge appears to exceed that of the black hole by a factor of about 200 .",
    "when hydrogen is processed in stellar nucleosynthesis , the mass  energy conversion efficiency is about @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the fraction of hydrogen burned in high - mass stars .",
    "when mass is accreted onto a black hole , the mass  energy conversion efficiency is expected to be about 0.1@xmath20 , with @xmath21 with the definition above .",
    "if accretion and nucleosynthesis were to generate the same amount of energy during the formation of a galaxy , then the ratio of mass contained in both processed stars and stellar remnants to that of a supermassive black hole is expected to be about 0.1@xmath22 . for @xmath23 and @xmath24 ,",
    "this ratio is about 36 . as a mass ratio of about 200",
    "is observed , this implies that a greater amount of energy , by a factor of about 6 , is generated by high - mass star - formation activity than by gravitational accretion .",
    "if the bulge - to - black - hole mass ratio is in fact greater than 200 , then either the factor by which star formation dominates will exceed 6 , or the accretion must have been more than 10% efficient ; that is @xmath25 .",
    "if low - efficiency accretion dominates the process of the build up of mass in the central black hole , then less than 1 part in 7 of the luminosity generated during galaxy formation will be attributed to accretion as compared with high - mass star formation .",
    "a greater amount of energy generated by star formation as compared with accretion processes appears to be favored by these circumstantial arguments .",
    "the dust emission process is thermal , with dust grains emitting a modified blackbody spectrum .",
    "grains of interstellar dust , distributed throughout the ism of a galaxy , are heated to temperatures between about 20 and 200k , depending on the spectrum and intensity of the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) , and the size and optical properties of the grains .",
    "higher dust temperatures can be produced close to a powerful source of radiation , with dust subliming at temperatures of order 2000k .",
    "very small grains can be heated far above their equilibrium temperatures by absorbing hard - uv photons ( see draine and li , 2001 ) .",
    "lower dust temperatures , always exceeding the cmb temperature , are possible in opaque regions of the ism that are shielded from intense heating , in the intergalactic medium or in regions with an intrinsically weak isrf .",
    "unless dust is heated by the isrf in addition to the cmb the galaxy will not be detectable .",
    "we now consider the properties of the dust emission that are relevant to observations of high - redshift galaxies .      the minimum parameters necessary to describe the emission from dust grains are a temperature @xmath26 and a form of the emissivity function @xmath27 . in any galaxy",
    "there will be a distribution of dust temperatures , reflecting the different nature and environment of each grain .",
    "it is useful to use @xmath26 to describe the coolest grains that contribute significantly to the energy output of a galaxy when discussing submm observations . in most cases ,",
    "spatially and spectrally resolved images of galaxies are not available , and so it is reasonable to assume a volume - averaged description of the emissivity function as a function of frequency @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "values of @xmath30 in the range 12 are usually assumed .",
    "scattering theory predicts that @xmath31 at low frequencies , while a value @xmath32 at high frequencies matches the general trend of the interstellar extinction curve that describes the properties of absorption of optical and uv radiation by the ism ( see calzetti et al . ,",
    "2000 and section2 of the review by franceschini , 2002 ) .    the simplest form of the emission spectrum / sed , @xmath33 is given by assuming that @xmath34 , in which @xmath35 is the planck function ( @xmath36 in the rayleigh  jeans limit , in units of wm@xmath37hz@xmath6sr@xmath6 ) .",
    "this assumes that the emitting source is optically thin .",
    "for fitting spectra of galaxies found in deep submm surveys , we assume the simple @xmath38 function to describe the sed .",
    "dunne et al .  ( 2000 ) and dunne and eales ( 2001 ) also use this functional form to fit the observed submm spectra of low - redshift galaxies . at the expense of adding another parameter to describe the sed",
    ", there is some physical motivation for a sed that includes an optical depth term , @xmath39 b_\\nu,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the frequency - dependent optical depth of the cloud , and is a multiple of @xmath27 .",
    "this equation tends to the simpler @xmath38 function at long wavelengths , and is assumed by , for example , benford et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , omont et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , priddey and mcmahon ( 2001 ) and isaak et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , whose submm data for high - redshift agns tends to correspond to rest - frame frequencies that are relatively close to the peak of the sed .",
    "the extra parameter required to relate @xmath40 and @xmath27 can be defined as the frequency at which @xmath41 and the cloud becomes optically thick .",
    "if the opacity near a wavelength of 100@xmath1 m is large , then the form of the peak of the sed tends to that of a blackbody spectrum .",
    "this suppresses the emission near to the sed peak relative to the emission in the rayleigh ",
    "jeans regime , and so this functional form provides a good fit to a set of submm and far - ir data with a higher value of @xmath26 as compared with the @xmath38 function , usually by about 1020% .",
    "however , because most observed seds for high - redshift galaxies have fewer than four data points ( see fig.[fig : sed ] ) , the difference is unlikely to be very significant .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the mid - ir sed can be smoothly interpolated from a modified blackbody function at low frequencies to a power - law @xmath42 in the mid - ir waveband on the high - frequency side of the spectral peak , in order to prevent the high - frequency sed from falling exponentially with a wien spectrum .",
    "hotter components of dust , emitting at shorter wavelengths , and ultimately stellar emission in the near - ir waveband , are certain to be present to reduce the steepness of the sed in the wien regime . that an exponential wien spectrum is inappropriate can be seen from the well - defined power - law mid - ir seds of arp220 and mrk231 shown in fig.[fig : sed ] .",
    "it is not always necessary to relate the sed @xmath33 and luminosity @xmath43 of a galaxy to the mass of dust @xmath44 that it contains ; this can of worms can remain closed by normalizing @xmath33 in a self - consistent way .",
    "however , if a dust mass is required , perhaps in order to estimate the metal content of the ism , and so provide information about the integrated star - formation activity in the galaxy at earlier times ( hughes et al .",
    ", 1997 ; omont et al . ,  2001 ) , then it is conventional to define a frequency - dependent mass - absorption coefficient @xmath45 ( draine and lee , 1984 ; with units of m@xmath4kg@xmath6 ) , which is proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath45 is the ` effective area ' for blackbody emission by a certain mass of dust , @xmath46 values of @xmath45 at a conventional frequency of around 1 mm are in the range 0.040.15m@xmath4kg@xmath6 ( hughes , 1996 ) .",
    "recent comparisons of optical extinction and submm emission from partially resolved edge - on spiral galaxies have tended to give values of 0.050.4m@xmath4kg@xmath6 ( see fig .",

    "note that there is at least a factor of 3 uncertainty in these conversion factors .",
    "an alternative dimensionless function @xmath47 ( hildebrand , 1983 ) is sometimes used , which includes information about the mass / volume and surface area of a typical grain . if grains are assumed to be spherical ( a big if ) , with bulk density @xmath48 , radius @xmath49 , and an emissive cross section @xmath50 , then @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 is the effective emissivity function describing the energy flux from unit area of the dust grain surface .",
    "however , dust grains are more likely to be irregular in shape , possibly colloidal or in the form of whiskers . in that case",
    ", the emissivity per unit mass would be increased , and the dust mass associated with a fixed luminosity would be overestimated .",
    "this geometrical uncertainty will inevitably result in uncertainty about the mass of dust .",
    "hence , dust masses quoted in papers must be treated with caution , and may be best used as a comparative measure to distinguish galaxies . in general , we will avoid quoting dust masses , as this is unlikely to provide a reliable physical measure of the properties of galaxies until detailed resolved images are available , which is likely to require observations with the alma interferometer .",
    "this will be a recurring theme : observations with excellent sensitivity and spatial resolution using a large interferometer will resolve many of the questions raised throughout the paper .    working from submm data ,",
    "it is also difficult to assess the dust mass of a galaxy , even subject to the caveats above , without knowing its dust temperature . in the rayleigh ",

    "if @xmath26 is uncertain to within a factor , then @xmath44 is uncertain to within the same factor .",
    "the dust mass is at least easier to estimate from a single long - wavelength observation than the luminosity @xmath43 .",
    "as @xmath54 , or equivalently @xmath55 , an uncertainty in @xmath26 corresponds to a proportionally much larger uncertainty in the inferred value of @xmath43 .",

    "if it can operate at frequencies of several 10 s of ghz , then the ska is also likely to be an efficient detector of low - excitation high - redshift co lines ( carilli and blain , 2002 ) .",
    "an interesting feature of the co line emission from low - redshift galaxies is that lines can lie in the passbands of continuum instruments , and could contribute to the continuum flux inferred . for low - redshift galaxies , the 345-ghz co(@xmath64 )",

    "the passband of the current scuba 850-@xmath1 m ( 353-ghz ) filter is about 120@xmath1 m ( 50ghz ) wide , and so about 15% of the measured continuum flux density of a low - redshift galaxy in the 850-@xmath1 m channel is likely to be from the co line .",
    "the high - frequency scuba passband in the 450-@xmath1 m atmospheric window is 75ghz wide , while the equivalent width of the co(@xmath65 ) transition is 3.3ghz .",
    "hence , a smaller 5% contribution to the continuum flux density from the line is expected at 450@xmath1 m .",
    "the co(@xmath66 ) line has an expected equivalent width of 9.2ghz , while the wide mambo passband has half - power points at 210 and 290ghz .",
    "contamination of the flux densities detected by mambo by about 10% may thus be expected .",
    "the largest of these correction factors is comparable to the calibration uncertainty in submm - wave observations , and could be relevant to the detailed interpretation of low - redshift observations .",
    "for example , the presence of the co(@xmath64 ) line in the 850-@xmath1 m window would shift the inferred continuum emissivity spectral index @xmath30 in the slugs survey from 1.3 to 1.52 . at high redshifts ,",
    "any corrections are likely to be less significant , both because the relatively bright co(@xmath64 ) line redshifts out of the 850-@xmath1 m passband , and the equivalent width of lines in frequency space decreases as @xmath67 .",
    "although the contribution to measured submm - wave flux densities from line emission could be significant at the level of order 10% , only a small fraction of the bolometric luminosity from galaxies is detected in the submm waveband .",
    "more than 99% of the bolometric luminosity still appears in the continuum , predominantly at shorter far - ir wavelengths .      the detectable flux density at an observed frequency @xmath28 from a galaxy with bolometric luminosity @xmath43 at redshift @xmath68 with an intrinsic sed @xmath33 , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the luminosity distance to redshift @xmath68 ( for example peebles , 1993 ) .",
    "the key feature that makes submm - wave observations of distant galaxies interesting is the ability to sample the sed of a target galaxy at wavelengths for which the sed is a strongly increasing function of frequency ( fig.[fig : sed ] ) .",
    "this ensures that distant galaxies are observed at a rest - frame wavelength closer to the peak of their sed .",
    "there is thus a strong , negative k correction , which leads to high - redshift galaxies being relatively easy to detect at submm wavelengths as compared with their low - redshift counterparts .",
    "this effect is illustrated in fig.[fig : svzcolor ] for the template sed from blain et al .",
    "( 1999b ) shown in fig.[fig : sed ] .",
    "the strong k - correction effect applies at wavelengths longer than about 250@xmath1 m . at these wavelengths the flux density from galaxies at @xmath71 ceases to decline with the inverse square of distance , but instead remains approximately constant with increasing redshift .",
    "a window is thus opened to the detection of all galaxies with similar seds at redshifts up to @xmath7220 .",
    "the effect is more pronounced at longer wavelengths : in the mm waveband more distant galaxies are expected to produce greater flux densities than their more proximate counterparts .",
    "note that both the radio and optical flux - density  redshift relations decline steeply with increasing redshift , and so high - redshift galaxies are not selected preferentially in those wavebands .",
    "the advantage that faint radio and optical galaxy surveys have over submm surveys comes from the complementary probe of astrophysical signatures , and the combination of greater fields of view and finer angular resolution .",
    "a submm telescope that is sufficiently sensitive to detect a certain class of galaxy at redshift @xmath73 , can detect any similar galaxies out to a redshift @xmath74 ( blain and longair , 1993a ) .",
    "note , however , that surveys to exploit this unusual k correction are not immune to selection effects .",
    "the k correction can also only be exploited at redshifts for which sufficient heavy elements are present in the ism of the target galaxy to form enough dust to reprocess optical radiation . nor does the k correction effect overcome cosmological surface brightness dimming for progressively more distant submm galaxies : the normal @xmath75 reduction in surface brightness still applies ; however , it is not expected to become significant until redshifts in excess of about 5 . because submm - wave telescopes do not yet resolve distant galaxies",

    "it may provide an opportunity to estimate redshifts for the most distant submm - selected galaxies when they can be resolved using alma .",
    "0.5 cm      deep submm - wave observations image the high - redshift universe with very little contamination from low - redshift galaxies , and can potentially find a population of galaxies that is quite different to those detected in conventional deep optical surveys , and which could be undetectable in these surveys .",
    "the complementarity of submm and optical observations is illustrated by the very limited overlap between galaxies detected in the deep submm  optical image shown in fig.[fig : a1835 ] .",

    "the relatively minor effects of different assumed cosmological models are also shown . changing the dust temperature has the greatest effect .",
    "the inferred luminosity of a dusty galaxy for a fixed observed submm flux density goes up by a factor of 10 if the dust temperature is doubled , at all but the very highest redshifts .",
    "there is thus a significant potential bias in submm surveys against the detection of galaxies with hotter dust temperatures for a given bolometric luminosity .",
    "this effect was noted by eales et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , when investigating the evolution of galaxies in the context of the results of deep scuba surveys .",
    "they suggested that the submm galaxies may be cooler than the temperatures of about 60k usually assumed , and so their significance as a population of strongly evolving high - redshift galaxies may have been overestimated .",
    "as discussed in section2.3 , a cooler dust temperature of 40k is compatible with observations of the seds of individual submm galaxies with confirmed redshifts detected in submm surveys ( ivison et al .",

    "2002 ) should be reliable .",
    "however , until a large sample of submm galaxies with redshifts and multi - waveband seds is available , the possibility that a cold or hot population of high - redshift dusty galaxies could be missing from or misidentified in submm surveys can not be ruled out ( eales et al . ,  1999",

    "this image provides a realistic impression of the appearance of deep optical and submm images of the sky .",
    "note that the only relatively low - redshift or cluster member galaxy that contributes any submm - wave flux is the central cd galaxy : the other cluster galaxies are either quiescent , neither forming stars nor heating dust , or are insufficiently luminous to be detectable at 850@xmath1 m using scuba .",
    "background galaxies at much greater redshift , which have faint optical counterparts as compared with the cluster member galaxies , dominate the image .",
    "this is a direct visual demonstration of the strong bias towards the detection of distant galaxies in submm - wave surveys that was illustrated in fig.[fig : svzcolor ] .",

    "there is also likely to be a bias ( at all redshifts ) towards both detecting agns , in which radio flux densities are boosted above the level expected from the standard radio  far - ir correlation , and the exclusion of a small population of low - redshift submm galaxies , which would be too bright in the radio and @xmath88band to be included in the survey . the rare , and perhaps especially interesting , submm galaxies at the lowest and highest redshifts are thus likely to be missing from radio pre - selected surveys , as are the distant submm galaxies with brighter optical magnitudes that are likely to be easiest to follow - up and investigate .",
    "the size of these selection effects is difficult to quantify at present .",

    ", the depth of the radio images used to make the comparison could be improved by a factor of several ; it is possible , but we suspect unlikely , that all submm sources have radio counterparts lurking just below existing detection thresholds .",

    "this is perfectly acceptable for gathering a list of high - redshift galaxies for further study ; however , for statistical analysis of a large sample of many tens of submm galaxies , the uncertainty introduced in the derived properties of the population due to incompleteness is expected to dominate the poisson uncertainty , and so limit the accuracy of the inferences that can be made .",
    "once the bright counts of distant 850-@xmath1 m galaxies are known from direct , hopefully unbiased , large - area scuba imaging surveys ( fox et al . ,  2002 ; scott et al . ,  2002 ) and matched with very deep radio images ( ivison et al . ,  2002 ) , then the value of this shortcut for compiling a large sample of submm galaxies can be assessed .",
    "the same strategy would be very valuable for wide - field mambo 1.2-mm surveys ( dannerbauer et al . ,  2002 ) .",
    "at present , some care needs to be taken in the interpretation of faint radio pre - selected surveys .      by virtue of their uniform selection function with redshift , it is impossible to even indicate the redshift of submm galaxies from single - wavelength submm flux densities alone .",
    "the relatively poor positional accuracy of submm images also makes it very difficult to identify an unambiguous optical counterpart for spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail when the properties of individual galaxies are described in section 3 . here",
    "we discuss some general features of the prospects for determining their redshifts from submm , far - ir and radio observations .",
    "the submm  far - ir sed of dusty galaxies is thermal , and so redshifting a fixed template sed affects the observed colors in exactly the same way as changing the dust temperature .",
    "this means that even when multi - frequency far - ir data is available , the redshift will be uncertain , unless there is information about the intrinsic dust temperature of the source .",
    "this effect is related to the selection effect in favor of cold galaxies illustrated in fig.[fig : sel ] .",
    "the expected colors of dusty galaxies , as a function of @xmath92 , the parameter that can be constrained in light of this degeneracy , is shown in fig.[fig : photz ] .",
    "colors in a variety of observing bands in both submm atmospheric windows and for the observing bands of the mips instrument on the _ space infrared telescope facility ( sirtf ) _ satellite are included .",
    "it is vital to stress that without knowledge of the dust temperature , it is impossible to determine a redshift from any combination of multicolor broadband far - ir / submm data .",
    "the degeneracy between @xmath26 and @xmath68 is lifted partially by combining information derived from radio observations , if @xmath93k .",
    "it may also become clear that there is a universal temperature  luminosity relation that extends to high redshifts , and can be exploited to determine redshift information using a far - ir  submm color  magnitude relation . in the absence of such a universal relation ,",
    "far - ir and submm colors can only be used to fix the parameter @xmath92 reliably .      in fig.[fig : svzcolor ] , an estimate of the flux density of radio emission of a template dusty galaxy was shown as a function of redshift .",
    "we now investigate the radio properties of submm galaxies , which provide useful information about their sed and redshift .",
    "there is an excellent observed correlation between the radio and far - ir ( 60- and 100-@xmath1 m ) flux densities of low - redshift galaxies over 4 orders of magnitude in luminosity , reviewed by condon ( 1992 ) and recently investigated out to @xmath94 by yun et al .",
    "if this correlation is assumed to hold to high redshifts , then submm - selected galaxies should be detectable in the deepest 10-@xmath1jy - rms 1.4-ghz vla radio images out to redshifts of order 3 .",
    "note that as a result of this correlation , optical spectroscopy of faint non - agn radio galaxies alone can be used to trace the evolution of star - formation activity to redshifts @xmath95 , beyond which spectroscopic redshifts are hard to determine ( haarsma et al .",
    ",  2000 ) .",
    "the far - ir  radio correlation is thought to be due to a match between the rate at which the optical / uv radiation from young stars is absorbed by dust on a local scale in star - forming regions of galaxies , and re - emitted as thermal far - ir radiation , and the radio luminosity from the same regions ( harwit and pacini , 1975 ) .",
    "the radio luminosity is due to both free  free emission in hii regions , and more importantly at frequencies less than about 10ghz , to the synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons accelerated in supernova shocks .",
    "if an agn is present , then it is likely that its accretion disk will provide an additional source of uv photons to heat dust , and both the disk and outflows will generate shocks to accelerate relativistic electrons .",
    "there is little reason to expect these effects to be proportional , unlike uv heating by massive stars and particle acceleration by supernova shocks in star - forming regions .",
    "radio - quiet qsos tend to lie on the radio - loud side of the far - ir  radio correlation , while radio - loud agn can lie up to three orders of magnitude away .",
    "carilli and yun ( 1999 , 2000 ) demonstrated that the radio  submm color is a useful redshift indicator , assuming that dusty galaxies have simple synchrotron seds in the radio waveband and thermal dust spectra in the submm and far - ir wavebands .",
    "the radio  submm color was also considered in the interpretation of the redshifts of galaxies detected in the submm surveys by hughes et al .  ( 1998 ) , lilly et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and eales et al .",
    "the carilli ",
    "yun redshift indicator is subject to a degeneracy between dust temperature and redshift , at dust temperatures less than about 60k : see fig.[fig : cy ] in which its form is shown for a variety of seds .",
    "hot , distant galaxies are difficult to distinguish from cool , low - redshift ones ( blain , 1999a , b ) . despite this degeneracy , the carilli ",
    "yun redshift indicator is very useful , especially for investigating optically faint submm galaxies for which almost no other information is available ( smail et al . ,  2000 ) .",
    "agn , which are expected to be radio - loud as compared with the standard far - ir  radio correlation , lead to conservatively low carilli  yun estimated redshifts .    at the highest redshifts ,",
    "two additional factors arise to modify the relation expected .",
    "first , synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons is likely to be suppressed .",
    "the intensity of synchrotron emission depends on only the energy density in the interstellar magnetic field , while the total cooling rate of the electrons depends on the sum of the energy densities in the interstellar magnetic field , for synchrotron losses , and in the isrf , for inverse compton scattering losses .",
    "the tight low - redshift far - ir  radio correlation implies that these energy densities are proportional over a very wide range of galaxy properties ( vlk , 1988 ) .",
    "however , above some critical redshift , the energy density in the cmb will always rise to dominate the isrf , upsetting this balance .",
    "inverse - compton electron cooling will then dominate and the amount of synchrotron emission will decline .",
    "note , however , that free  free emission does not suffer this suppression at high redshifts , and so should remain detectable out to any practical redshift .",
    "the almost flat sed of free  free emission ensures a more favorable k correction for high - redshift galaxies than expected for a pure synchrotron emission spectrum .",
    "the free  free emission spectrum cuts off only at photon energies greater than the thermal energy of emitting electrons in hii regions . in the absence of free  free optical depth effects , for @xmath2k",
    "this corresponds to optical frequencies ( yun and carilli , 2002 ) . in fig.[fig : svz_highz ] we show the effects of cmb suppression of synchrotron emission , for a ratio of energy densities in the magnetic field and the isrf of 0.33 , which is reasonable for m82 and the milky way ( hummell , 1986 ) .",
    "we assume a galaxy sed template that lies on the standard far - ir  radio correlation at @xmath96 ( condon , 1992 ) .",
    "secondly , again most significant at high redshifts , a minimum dust temperature is imposed by the rising cmb temperature : dust must be hotter than the cmb . given that observed dust temperatures in ultraluminous galaxies seem to lie in the range 40100k , then this may become an important factor at redshifts @xmath97 , if an early generation of stars generates the heavy elements required to form dust prior to these redshifts .",
    "for cooler milky - way - like seds , this effect would be important at @xmath98 .",
    "an increase in dust temperature due to cmb heating at high redshifts shifts the peak of the dust sed to higher frequencies , counteracting the beneficial k correction illustrated in fig.[fig : svzcolor ] . as a result",
    ", there is a firm upper limit to the redshift at which submm continuum radiation can be exploited to image the most distant galaxies efficiently , even if these galaxies do contain dust .",
    "this is illustrated by the flux density  redshift relations at 230 , 90 and 30ghz shown in fig.[fig : svz_highz ] : at redshifts greater than about 15 all three curves have the same form .",
    "both of these factors were included in the derivation of the curves in fig.[fig : cy ] , which should thus provide an accurate guide to the usefulness of the carilli ",
    "yun redshift indicator out to the highest redshifts .",
    "note that the indicator becomes of little use for the most distant galaxies , for which an almost constant radio : submm flux ratio of about @xmath99 is expected .",
    "in addition , the hottest dusty galaxies may be more likely to contain agn , and thus to lie on the radio - loud side of the far - ir  radio correlation .",
    "this effect could make the interpretation of fig.[fig : cy ] for determining redshifts ambiguous , even if @xmath100k .",
    "however , it should always guarantee a conservative estimate of the redshift for any observed galaxy .",
    "foreground absorption is not a problem for very high - redshift sources of any radio , submm or far - ir radiation .",
    "it is thus likely that the most sensitive future instruments at submm and radio wavelengths , alma and the ska will both be able to detect ` first light ' galaxies .",
    "note , however , that a mask of foreground structure may be significant for radio observations ( waxman and loeb , 2000 ) . a practical limit to the capability of determining the history of very early star formation from an ` ska deep field ' could also be set by the low , cosmologically - dimmed surface brightness of galaxies at the highest redshifts , and their potentially overlapping emission regions .",
    "the importance of both of these factors is expected to depend critically on the unknown physical sizes of the first galaxies .",
    "alma will probably be limited to observe galaxies out to a maximum redshift set by the requirement that sufficient metals have been generated to form obscuring dust at that early epoch . to compare what might be possible in the near - ir waveband",
    ", the emission from a @xmath101-k blackbody stellar photosphere at 5@xmath1 m is shown in fig.[fig : svz_highz ] , cutoff at the redshift beyond which absorption by redshifted lyman-@xmath56 becomes important in the band .",
    "this indicates the potential for probing the earliest galaxies using a near - ir camera on the _ next generation space telescope ( ngst)_. free - free emission and redshifted near - ir stellar emission may thus be the best routes to the detection of the first galaxies at redshifts greater than 10 , if they exist .",
    "well over 100 submm - selected galaxies are now known ( see fig.[fig : count1 ] ) , although their redshifts and detailed astrophysical properties are very largely uncertain .",
    "the key information available about their properties comes from observations of discrete galaxies made using the scuba and mambo bolometer array cameras at wavelengths of 450 , 850 and 1200@xmath1 m .",

    "the deepest counts at 850 and 15@xmath1 m come from surveys made in fields magnified by gravitational lensing clusters .",
    "surface brightness conservation in the lensing process ensures that the mean background intensity in the direction of a lens should be the same as that in a blank field .    from the properties of the counts and backgrounds alone , without any details of the individual galaxies involved , it is possible to infer important details about the population of distant dust - enshrouded galaxies .    the significant surface density of the faint scuba and mambo galaxies , when coupled to plausible seds ( blain et al . ,  1999b ; trentham et al . ,  1999",

    ", this could be accounted for by the use of this unduly restrictive limit on the intensity of the submm background spectrum . once submm count data became available after scuba was commissioned , it was possible to take either a more empirical or a more theoretical view of the consequences for dusty galaxy evolution .    on the empirical side , forms of evolution of the low - redshift luminosity function of dusty galaxies ( saunders et al . ,  1990 ; soifer and neugebauer , 1991 ) that were required to fit the count and background data could be determined ( malkan and stecker , 1998 , 2001 ; blain et al .",

    "less than about unity , this is done by requiring that the predicted counts of low - redshift _ iras _ and moderate - redshift _ iso _ galaxies are in reasonable agreement with observations . at greater redshifts , where the form of evolution is constrained by submm count and background data , there is significant degeneracy in the models : strong evolution could proceed all the way out to a relatively low cutoff redshift ( @xmath1473 ) , or the strong evolution could terminate at a lower redshift @xmath85 , followed by a tail of either non - evolving or declining luminosity density out to greater redshifts ( @xmath148 ) ( see fig.9 of blain et al .",

    "this degeneracy occurs because the far - ir background radiation ( like almost all backgrounds ) is generated predominantly at @xmath85 , while submm galaxies can contribute to the counts equally at almost any redshift @xmath149",

    "the form of evolution that is consistent with the latest observational constraints and radio - derived redshift information for submm - selected galaxies ( smail et al . ,  2002 ) is shown by the thick solid and dashed lines in fig.[fig : madau ] .    note that the assumptions that underlie these derivations are not yet all verified by observations .",
    "it is unclear whether all high - redshift dusty galaxies detected in submm surveys have similar seds .",
    "it is possible that the properties of the dust grains in galaxies evolve with redshift , leading to a systematic modification to the temperature or emissivity index .",
    "it is reasonable to expect the dust - to - gas ratio in the highest redshift galaxies to be lower than in low - redshift galaxies , as less enrichment has taken place .",
    "however , note that enrichment proceeds very rapidly once intense star formation activity is underway .",
    "even the very first regions of intense star formation could thus be readily visible in the submm , despite the global metallicity being extremely low . while it seems unlikely , based on a handful of observations ( fig.[fig : sed ] ) , it is certainly possible that a population of dusty galaxies with a significantly different sed is missing from current calculations ( blain and phillips , 2002 ) .    a more theoretically - motivated approach , based on making assumptions about the astrophysical processes at work in galaxy evolution and then predicting the observational consequences , has rightly become popular in recent years .",
    "these ` semi - analytic ' models , which were generally developed to explain optical and near - ir observations , take a representative set of dark - matter halos that evolve and merge over cosmic time , from the results of n - body simulations , and determine their star - formation histories and appearance using a set of recipes for star - formation and feedback ( white and frenk , 1991 ; kauffmann and white , 1993 ; cole et al . ,  1994 , 2000 ;",

    ", 1998 ) , or breaking away from their traditional reliance on a universal initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "as more information becomes available , then the full capabilities of the semi - analytic models can hopefully be applied to address dusty galaxy evolution .    in a blend of these approaches , assuming that the scuba galaxies are all associated with merging galaxies ( ivison et al . ,  1998a , 2001 ; figs.[fig : blob ] and",

    "the observed background spectrum can only be reproduced for strong evolution of the total luminosity density out to redshift @xmath105 , by a factor of about 20 ( see fig.[fig : madau ] ) .",
    "in addition , the lifetime of the luminous phase associated with mergers , and thus the mass - to - light ratio also had to be reduced by a large factor at high redshift in order to reproduce the observed submm counts .",
    "the physical reason for this change must be an increased efficiency of star formation during starburst activity or of agn fueling at increasing redshifts ; both make sense in light of the greater gas densities expected at high redshifts .",
    "the model has the advantage of being able to reproduce the faint optical counts , if blue lbgs are also associated with merging galaxies .",
    "the submm galaxies release about four times more energy in total than the lbgs , and do so over a period of time during a merger that is about ten times shorter .",
    "it is likely that the total baryonic mass and geometry of the merging galaxies also play important roles in determining the details of star - formation activity or agn fueling during a merger .",
    "when reviewing the predictions and results of any model , note that it is easy to produce a model that can account for the far - ir  submm background radiation intensity ; more difficult to account for the submm counts ; and more difficult again to reproduce a plausible redshift distribution .",

    "however , when estimating a total luminosity density from 15-@xmath1 m data , it is vital that the correct sed is used to extrapolate to longer wavelengths , as it is easy to overestimate the amount of luminosity associated with a 15-@xmath1 m source by assuming a mid - ir sed that is too steep .",

    "is more difficult than extrapolating submm observations to fix the position of the peak of the sed that lies at shorter wavelengths .",

    "the significant changes in the count slope are particularly unusual , and not found in any other waveband . as a result , the magnification bias can be large , increasing the number of detectable bright galaxies ( blain , 1996 , 1997 ) , and providing a way to investigate very faint counts by comparing lensed and unlensed fields ; for example in the innermost regions of clusters of galaxies ( blain , 2002 ) .    that a significant magnification bias can be exploited using relatively weak lensing by clusters of galaxies can be seen by comparing the number of 1020-mjy 850-@xmath1 m galaxies detected in the scuba lens survey ( smail et al . ,  1997 , 2002 ) , and in the larger field of the unlensed 8-mjy survey ( scott et al . ,  2002 ) .",
    "the ratio is about 3:1 , showing a clear positive magnification bias , and indicating that if the 850-@xmath1 m counts at flux densities greater than 10mjy are represented by a power - law , then the index @xmath163 .",
    "the key advantage of observing background galaxies that are gravitationally lensed by foreground mass concentrations in the submm waveband is that the k correction ( fig.[fig : svzcolor ] ) acts to brighten the distant background lensed galaxy as compared with the lens .",
    "this is already very familiar from surveys of lensed radio agn ( rusin , 2001 ) , and is illustrated clearly in fig.[fig : a1835 ] , in which only the central cd galaxy in the lensing cluster shows any significant submm emission .    in scuba cluster lens surveys , both the image separations , and",
    "the extent of the high - magnification regions are of order 1arcmin , a scale which is well matched both to the 15-arcsec resolution of the jcmt and to the 2.5-arcmin field of view of scuba .",
    "the magnification ensures that a significantly greater fraction of the submm - wave background radiation intensity is thus resolved into detectable galaxies in surveys in the fields of gravitational lensing clusters than in even the deepest blank - field surveys ( blain et al .",
    ",  1999a ) .",
    "however , for background sources lensed by galaxies rather than clusters , the relevant image separations and the extent of the high - magnification region are only of order 1arcsec , and so can not be resolved using any single - antenna telescope .",
    "high - resolution submm observations are required to disentangle lensed and unlensed galaxies ; this capability will be provided by alma ( blain , 2002 ) , while pilot studies of should be possible using the carma , sma and iram pdbi interferometers .",
    "the most luminous lensed sources can already be resolved into multiple images using the iram mm - wave interferometer ( alloin et al . ,  1997 ) .",
    "the only caveat for exploiting galaxy - scale lensing is that the source size must be small as compared with the area of sky behind the lens that is strongly magnified .",
    "the intense far - ir and submm emission from low - redshift ulirgs is typically very compact ( several hundred pc across ; downes and solomon , 1998 ) , and would easily meet this condition ; however , there are indications that the dust emission from at least some luminous high - redshift submm galaxies could extend over scales greater than 10-kpc ( papadopoulos et al . ,  2001 ; chapman et al .",
    ",  2001a ; lutz et al . ,  2001 ; isaak et al . ,  2002 ; ivison et al . ,",
    "the whole area of sky covered by these galaxies would not then be lensed efficiently by an intervening galaxy , although bright knots of emission within them could still be magnified by large factors .",
    "this concern about lensing efficiency and the angular size of distant submm galaxies does not apply to lensing by much larger clusters of galaxies , which will always be effective .",
    "larger area surveys for brighter samples of luminous dusty galaxies using the array of forthcoming ground - based , air- and space - borne instruments , including bolocam , blast , sofia , scuba - ii , _ sirtf _ , _ herschel _ and _ planck surveyor _ ( see table[table : space ] ) , should be subject to an enhanced magnification bias .",
    "high - resolution follow - up observations using alma should then yield a large sample of strongly magnified high - redshift lensed systems to complement the systematically selected class sample of gravitational lensed agn identified at radio wavelengths ( rusin , 2001 ) .",
    "these surveys will not be subject to any extinction bias due to absorption by dust in the lensing galaxies , and should yield a very complete and reliable catalog of up to several thousand lenses ( blain , 1998 ) .",
    "during the last 4 years , the first steps have been taken towards investigating the universe using direct submm - wave surveys .",
    "the technologies of the class of detectors that made these initial surveys possible are still developing rapidly .",
    "many instrumentation projects are underway , which will allow us to increase the sizes of samples of distant submm galaxies , and to study known examples in more detail ; some of their key features are outlined in tables[table : ground][table : instrument ] .",
    "a key technology under development is for bolometers with superconducting temperature - sensitive elements , including transition - edge sensors ( tess ) .",
    "these are much more stable than the semiconducting thermistors used in existing systems , and so can be read out using multiplexed , and therefore much simpler , cold electronics .",
    "another advantage of tes devices is that they require no bias current , and so need fewer heat - conducting , difficult - to - assemble connections to each device .",
    "the prototype fabry  perot spectroscopic device fibre , which uses tes bolometers ( benford et al . ,  2001 ) , was tested successfully at the cso in may 2001 .",
    "tes devices offer the prospect of increasing the size of the arrays of detector elements in mm / submm - wave cameras from of order 100 to of order 10@xmath168 , providing much larger fields of view .",
    "filled - array detector devices using conventional semiconducting bolometers are being demonstrated in the sharc - ii and hawc cameras for the cso and sofia , while the scuba - ii camera has a goal of at least a @xmath3arcmin field of view ",
    "about 25 times greater than the field of view of scuba  is under development in edinburgh and is expected to integrate large arrays and superconducting bolometers .",
    "scuba - ii will supplement its much wider field of view with an enhanced point source sensitivity : the same galaxies should be detectable about 8 and 4 times faster using scuba - ii as compared with scuba at wavelengths of 850 and 450@xmath1 m respectively : see table[table : ground ] .",
    "a 10-m telescope operating at 850-@xmath1 m with a @xmath169-element detector would have a square field of view about 1deg on a side , at a nyquist - sampled plate scale : much larger than the 5-arcmin@xmath4 fields of view of scuba and mambo .",
    "with such large fields of view , it is not unreasonable to survey most of the sky down to the confusion limit of a 1030-m telescope in an observing campaign lasting for several years .    by combining large numbers of bolometer detectors with dispersive mm - wave optics ( glenn , 2001 ) ,",
    "it should be possible to obtain low - resolution mm - wave spectra of galaxies over a very wide band , perhaps 100ghz , to search for co and atomic fine - structure line emission from high - redshift submm galaxies detected in continuum surveys , while simultaneously carrying out unbiased surveys for line - emitting galaxies within the field of view ( blain et al .",
    ",   2000b ) .",
    "development of several such systems is underway .",
    "phase - sensitive heterodyne submm detectors are already very efficient ; however , only small numbers of these detectors can currently be fabricated into an array .",
    "their strength is in very high resolution submm - wave spectroscopy , and as sensitive coherent detectors in existing mm - wave interferometers .",
    "they will be fitted to the forthcoming sma and carma , and will be be exploited to the full with the large collecting area of the alma array .",
    "sensitive arrays of mid- and far - ir detectors should soon be flying , both in space aboard _",
    "sirtf _ and _ astro - f _ , and in the upper atmosphere , on balloons such as blast , and aboard sofia .",
    "limits to the continuum flux densities of the most luminous high - redshift galaxies derived using these facilities , measured close to the peak of their sed ( see fig.[fig : sed ] ) , will provide valuable information about their properties .",
    "spectrographs , both aboard these facilities and on ground - based telescopes , will provide detections of and sensitive limits to the line radiation from the same objects , providing redshift information and astrophysical diagnostics .      at present , a wide range of submm - wave telescopes are available .",
    "single - antenna telescopes include the 10.4-m cso on mauna kea , the 10-m heinrich hertz telescope ( hht ) on mount graham , the 15-m jcmt on mauna kea , the 15-m sest at la silla in chile , the 30-m iram telescope in spain , and the 45-m antenna at nobeyama in japan .",
    "the large millimeter telescope ( lmt ) , a 50-m mm - wave telescope is under construction on a 5000-m peak near puebla in mexico , and it is hoped that the 100-m green bank telescope ( gbt ) in west virginia can operate at 90ghz/3 mm during the winter .",
    "new single - antenna telescopes with large survey cameras have been proposed for the excellent submm observing sites at the south pole and the alma site in chile .",
    "planck surveyor _ cmb imaging mission will generate an all - sky map in the submm at a resolution of 5arcmin , and the 3.5-m _ herschel _ space telescope will carry out pointed submm imaging and spectroscopic observations of known galaxies , and carry out deep confusion - limited cosmological surveys over fields several hundred square degrees in size .",
    "cameras exploiting the 2.5-m telescope aboard sofia and blast and other dedicated ultra - long - duration balloon instruments will allow far - ir and submm - wave observations from the upper atmosphere .",
    "existing mm - wave interferometers include the @xmath170-m iram pdbi , the @xmath171-m ovro mma , the @xmath172-m bima array at hat creek in california and the @xmath173-m nobeyama millimeter array .",
    "the 8 @xmath174 6-m sma is under construction on mauna kea , the first imaging submm - wave interferometer , while it is planned to combine 9 of the bima antennas with the ovro mma at a high site in the inyo mountains east of owens valley in california to form carma .",
    "the international 64 @xmath174 12-m alma submm interferometer array in chile will provide a tremendous increase in the capability of submm - wave spectral line and continuum imaging , providing 10- to 30-@xmath1arcsec resolution , and detailed images of even the most distant galaxies .",
    "the most luminous submm galaxies so far discovered , with 850-@xmath1 m flux densities of about 25mjy , could be detected at a 10-@xmath130 significance by alma in about a second .",
    "its excellent sensitivity and wide 8-ghz instantaneous bandwidth will allow a significant fraction of the galaxies detected in deep surveys to be detected simultaneously in the continuum and co rotation lines , providing direct and exact redshifts .",
    "as the redshifted ladder of co lines are separated by @xmath175ghz , about 25% of galaxies at @xmath176 will have a co line lying within the 8-ghz - wide alma band ( blain et al .",
    ",  2000b ) .",
    "the enhanced capabilities of this array of new facilities is illustrated in fig.[fig : rate ] .",
    "the rate at which galaxies can be detected is likely to grow dramatically from a few per day at present to many hundreds per hour .",
    "note that the various instruments operate at different wavelengths , and so each is most sensitive to galaxies at different redshifts and with different luminosities .",
    "however , sample sizes are certain to increase dramatically , especially when the @xmath17710@xmath178 galaxies that will be detected in the _ planck surveyor _ all - sky survey are taken into account .",
    "multiwavelength follow - up observations of all these new submm galaxies are likely to remain a time - consuming challenge .",
    "however , the likely availability of 30-m - aperture ground - based optical / near - ir telescopes in the next decades , and the extremely deep imaging capability of _ ngst _ , should help us to study a complete sample of submm galaxies down to luminosities that are only a fraction of @xmath120 .",

    "the most sensitive follow - up observations are required in the near - ir , radio and optical wavebands to identify and study them ( frayer et al . ,  2000 ; ivison et al . ,  2001 ) , that is very faint detection thresholds of order 10@xmath1jy at 1.4-ghz , @xmath203 and @xmath204 respectively .",

    "typical examples of the submm population can be detected in imaging - mode scuba observations in about 10h of integration .",
    "however , at least 2h of near - ir observations at the 10-m keck telescope and about 24h of integration at the vla are then required in order to find likely counterparts to typical submm galaxies .",
    "the advantage of the vla radio observations over those at optical and near - ir wavelengths is the very large field of view , which allows many galaxies to be detected simultaneously .",
    "the very brightest optical counterparts to submm galaxies can be identified spectroscopically in about 7h of integration using 4-m class telescopes ( ivison et al . ,  1998 ) and",
    "higher - quality spectra can be obtained in a comparable time using 8-m class telescopes ( see the results of a 5-h integration using the uves spectrograph at the european southern observatory ( eso ) vlt by vernet and cimatti , 2001 ) . in all cases , identifying a plausible counterpart , where possible , is only a first step ; finding a redshift for these typically faint , red galaxies is much more challenging . in this context , the unusual sensitivity of submm surveys to the most distant galaxies is almost a drawback , making it very hard to detect a complete sample of submm galaxies at other wavelengths .    key questions for understanding submm galaxies in the future include :    what are the properties of typical submm galaxies in other wavebands , and what is their relationship to other high - redshift galaxy samples ? the submm - selected galaxies appear to a diverse mixture of types , including bright merging systems ( ivison et al . ,   1998a , 2000a , 2001 ) , optical qsos ( kraiberg knudsen et al . ,",

    "note that some of this apparent diversity is sure to be due to the very wide redshift distribution of the submm galaxies .    what is the redshift distribution of the submm galaxies ?",
    "models of the evolution of submm galaxies that do not grossly violate basic observational constraints on the source counts and cosmic background radiation are easy to generate . however , it is vital to predict a plausible redshift distribution , with only a small fraction at redshifts less than unity , and a probable median redshift of at least 23 .",
    "it is easy to generate a redshift distribution that is biased too high .",
    "the observational determination of a redshift distribution for a well - defined sample of submm galaxies remains a crucial goal .",
    "this will be easy with alma . in the meantime , concerted and time - consuming campaigns of optical and near - ir spectroscopy will pay off gradually , while observations of cm - wave megamasers and the development of wide - band mm- and cm - wave spectrometers may offer alternative routes .",
    "the forthcoming ( sub)mm interferometers carma and sma , and developments of the iram pdbi will also provide accurate positions and some co redshifts for submm galaxies .",
    "what are the details of the astrophysics responsible for the luminosity of the submm galaxies ?",
    "this is very important , as the submm galaxies appear to be signposts to some of the most luminous and violent phases of galaxy evolution , and could be associated with the formation of the bulk of galactic bulges , elliptical galaxies and supermassive black holes ( lilly et al .",
    ",  1999 ; dunlop , 2001 ) .",
    "whether these galaxies are formed in a single event , or as a series of lesser bursts , is a key question for our understanding of the process of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "detailed comparisons of the luminosity derived from dust continuum emission , the dynamical mass inferred from molecular line profiles , the evolved stellar mass inferred from near - ir observations , and the spatial extent of the activity from various high - resolution observations will all be important for disentangling the complex astrophysics of these systems .    when can submm instruments be used to resolve and study high - redshift galaxies in detail ?",
    "this is already practical given enough observing time at the ovro mma and the iram pdbi .",
    "the carma and sma interferometers will soon have important roles to play in these studies . in about 10 years , alma will provide the first real chance to detect and study galaxies rapidly and in great detail using submm observations alone .",
    "luminosities , redshifts , dynamical masses and metallicities could all be determined without needing to resort to radio , optical and near - ir observations as a matter of course . however , because alma has a relatively small field of view , the most efficient survey strategy may be to detect large numbers of galaxies using wide - field mm / submm cameras like bolocam , scuba - ii and their successors on single - antenna 1050-m aperture survey telescopes , and the _ herschel _ and _ planck surveyor _ space missions , and then use alma to provide detailed images and spectra of all the detected galaxies .    what is the fundamental limit to making submm observations of distant galaxies ?",
    "submm observations rely on the presence of metals , in the form of molecular gas or dust grains in order to detect galaxies . while submm radiation is able to travel unattenuated across the universe from prior to the epoch of reionization , it is possible that a large fraction of pre - reionization ` first - light ' sources are insufficiently dusty and metal rich to be detectable as continuum sources .",
    "low - metallicity galaxies should be detectable by fine - structure c and o far - ir line emission , however",
    ". it would be tremendously exciting to see the birth of the first metal - enriched dusty systems with alma , and so perhaps to determine directly the redshift limit for submm surveys .",
    "of course , even if this were possible , alma would still have a long and fruitful career studying the detailed astrophysics of galaxies out to and beyond redshift 5 , while the search for the most primitive galaxies in the second and third decades of the century is taken up by space - based mid - ir interferometers and the ska radio telescope ( see fig.[fig : svz_highz ] ) .",
    "submm observations of the distant universe are a new tool for probing the earliest and most dramatic stages of the evolution of galaxies . over the years to come , the capabilities of submm - wave observatories , and our understanding of the universe in this new window , should continue to advance dramatically .",
