    "the space of all @xmath0 hermitian matrices @xmath1 with probability density function @xmath6 is known as the _ gaussian unitary ensemble _ ( or gue)@xcite . here and henceforth the variance is chosen to ensure that asymptotically for @xmath7 , the limiting mean density of the gue eigenvalues is given by the wigner semicircle law @xmath8 supported in the interval @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "the characteristic polynomial @xmath10 of the matrix @xmath1 constitutes one of the most basic quantities of interest , encoding all eigenvalues of @xmath1 through the roots of @xmath11 .",
    "as one varies the argument @xmath12 over an interval containing many eigenvalues for a given realization of the ensemble , the value of the polynomial @xmath13 shows huge variations by the orders of magnitude for large @xmath14 , see figure [ fig : guerealizationn50 ] for @xmath15 and figure [ fig : n3000gueres ] for @xmath16 .     for @xmath15 .",
    "the global maximum is marked with a red circle . ]",
    "the purpose of this article is to describe the statistical properties of the _ highest peak _ displayed by the modulus of the gue polynomial @xmath17 , namely the probability density for the maximum value attained by @xmath17 over the interval @xmath18 $ ] on the real line as @xmath3 .",
    "our main result is the following    [ pred ] consider the random variable @xmath19}\\bigg\\{2\\log|p_{n}(x)|-2\\mathbb{e}(\\log|p_{n}(x)|)\\bigg\\ } \\label{maxrv}\\ ] ] then in the limit @xmath3 we have @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a continuous random variable characterized by the two - sided laplace transform of its probability density : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 stand for the euler gamma - function and the barnes digamma - function , correspondingly .",
    "the normalization @xmath25 can be evaluated explicitly as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the glaisher - kinkelin constant @xmath28 .",
    "the product form of the laplace transform offers an interesting interpretation of the above results .",
    "noting that @xmath29 is the moment generating function of a standard gumbel random variable @xmath30 , we can write @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an independent random variable with two - sided laplace transform @xmath33 in the end of the paper we provide convincing numerical evidence that this laplace transform does indeed define a unique random variable @xmath32 .",
    "this immediately implies that the probability density of @xmath21 is the convolution of a gumbel random variable with @xmath32 .",
    "such a convolution structure is expected to appear universally when studying the extreme value statistics of logarithmically correlated gaussian fields , see the discussion around and after eq .",
    "( [ lcdef ] ) .    in recent years",
    ", much interest has accumulated regarding the statistical behaviour of characteristic polynomials of various random matrices as a function of the spectral variable @xmath12 . to a large extent",
    "this interest was stimulated by the established paradigm that many statistical properties of the riemann zeta function along the critical line , that is @xmath34 , can be understood by comparison with analogous properties of the characteristic polynomials of random matrices @xcite .",
    "for invariant ensembles @xcite of self - adjoint matrices with real eigenvalues , statistical characteristics of @xmath11 depend very essentially on the choice of scale spanned by the real variable @xmath12 . from that end",
    "it is conventional to say that @xmath12 spans the _ local _ ( or _ microscopic _ ) scale if one considers intervals containing in the limit @xmath7 typically only a finite number of eigenvalues ( the corresponding scale for gue in ( [ guedensity ] ) is of the order of @xmath35 ) . at such scales , standard objects of interest",
    "are correlation functions containing products and ratios of characteristic polynomials , which show determinantal / pfaffian structures @xcite for hermitian / real symmetric matrices and tend to universal limits at the local scale .",
    "similar structures arise for properly defined characteristic polynomials @xmath36 of circular ensembles ( like cue , coe , and cse)@xcite of unitary random matrices @xmath37 uniformly distributed with respect to the haar measure on @xmath38 ( and other classical groups ) @xcite , whose properties on the local scale are indistinguishable from their hermitian counterparts .    next , when @xmath12 spans an interval containing in the limit @xmath7 typically of order of @xmath14 eigenvalues one speaks of the _ global _ ( or _ macroscopic _ ) scale behaviour .",
    "at such a scale properties of @xmath13 display both universal and non - universal features , the latter depending on the ensemble chosen .",
    "the study of characteristic polynomials at such a scale was initiated in @xcite where it was shown that the function @xmath39 , with @xmath37 belonging to the cue , converges ( in an appropriate sense ) to a random gaussian fourier series of the form @xmath40 where the coefficients @xmath41 are independent standard complex gaussian random variables , i.e. @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the covariance structure associated with such a process is given by @xmath45 as long as @xmath46 .",
    "such a ( generalized ) random function @xmath47 is a representative of random processes known in the literature under the name of _",
    "1/f noises _ , see @xcite for background discussion and further references .",
    "recently the study of the global scale behaviour was extended to the gue polynomial @xmath13 in @xcite by using earlier insights from @xcite and @xcite . that work revealed again a structure analogous to that of ( [ 1/f ] ) , though different in detail .",
    "namely , it was shown that the natural limit of @xmath48 is given by the random chebyshev - fourier series @xmath49 with @xmath50 being chebyshev polynomials and real @xmath51 being independent standard gaussians .",
    "a quick computation shows that the covariance structure associated with the generalized process @xmath52 is given by an integral operator with kernel @xmath53 as long as @xmath54 .",
    "such a limiting process @xmath52 is an example of an aperiodic @xmath55-noise .",
    "finally , one can consider an intermediate , or _",
    "spectral scales , with intervals typically containing in the limit @xmath7 the number of eigenvalues growing with @xmath14 , but representing still a vanishingly small fraction of the total number @xmath14 of all eigenvalues .",
    "the properties of the characteristic polynomials at such scales were again addressed in @xcite where it was shown that for the gue , that object gives rise to a particular ( singular ) instance of the so - called fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) @xcite with the hurst index @xmath56 , again characterized by correlations logarithmic in the spectral parameter .",
    "the discussion above serves , in particular , the purpose of pointing to an intimate connection between gaussian random processes with logarithmic correlations and the modulus of characteristic polynomials at global and mesoscopic scales .",
    "the relation is important as logarithmically correlated gaussian ( lcg ) random processes and fields attract growing attention in mathematical physics and probability and play an important role in problems of quantum gravity , turbulence , and financial mathematics , see e.g. @xcite . in particular , the periodic @xmath55 noise ( [ 1/f ] ) emerged in constructions of conformally invariant planar random curves @xcite . among other things ,",
    "the statistics of the global maximum of lcg fields attracted considerable attention , see @xcite and references therein . particularly relevant in the present context",
    "are the results of ding , roy and zeitouni @xcite on the maxima of regularized lattice versions of lcg fields which we discuss informally below .",
    "let @xmath57 be the @xmath58dimensional box of side length @xmath14 with the left bottom corner located at the origin .",
    "a suitably normalized version of the logarithmically correlated gaussian field is a collection of gaussian variables @xmath59 with variance @xmath60 and covariance structure @xmath61 where @xmath62 and both @xmath63 and @xmath64 are continuous bounded functions far enough from the boundary of @xmath65 .",
    "now set @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the limiting law of @xmath68 is then expected , after an appropriate shift and rescaling , to be given by the _",
    "gumbel distribution with random shift _ : @xmath69 where the distribution of the random shift variable @xmath70 depends on details of the behaviour of covariance ( [ lcdef ] ) for @xmath71 and @xmath72 , see the detailed discussion in @xcite .",
    "the random variable @xmath73 is related to the so called _ derivative martingale _ associated with the lcg fields @xcite whose distribution is however not known .",
    "recently it has been shown that the recentering term @xmath74 in also holds for a randomized model of the riemann zeta function @xcite , proved by revealing a special branching structure within the associated logarithmic correlations .",
    "we see that our conjecture [ pred ] for the maximum of characteristic polynomial of large gue matrices fully agrees with the predicted structure of the maximum of lcg in dimension @xmath75 .",
    "note that the expression ( [ lcmax ] ) implies that the double - sided laplace transform of the density @xmath76 for the ( shifted ) maximum @xmath21 is related to the density @xmath77 of the random variable @xmath70 as @xmath78 which is in turn equivalent to the gumbel convolution in eq.([uprime ] ) .",
    "in fact our formula ( [ uprimelaplace ] ) provides the explicit form of the distribution for the derivative martingale of our model , thus going considerably beyond the considerations of @xcite .    from a quite different perspective , processes similar to ( [ 1/f ] ) and ( [ 1/fch ] ) appeared in the context of statistical mechanics of disordered systems when studying extreme values of random multifractal landscapes supporting spinglass - like thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "the latter link is especially important in the context of the present paper .",
    "the idea that it is beneficial to look at @xmath79 as a disordered landscape consisting of many peaks and dips , and to think of an associated statistical mechanics problem was put forward in @xcite .",
    "it allowed to get quite non - trivial analytical insights into statistics of the maximal value of the cue polynomial sampled over the full circle @xmath80 $ ] , or over its mesoscopic sub - intervals .",
    "this was further used to conjecture the associated properties of the modulus of the riemann zeta - function along the critical line , see some recent advances inpired by that line of research in @xcite .",
    "some relations between between cue characteristic polynomials and logarithmically correlated processes ( in the form of the so - called `` multiplicative chaos '' measures introduced by kahane , see @xcite for a review ) was recently rigorously verified in @xcite .",
    "the case of gue polynomials however remained outstanding .",
    "it is our objective in this paper to provide two separate means of supporting conjecture [ pred ] .",
    "first , we will provide careful and explicit , albeit in part heuristic , analytical arguments .",
    "although our technique is inspired by the approach of @xcite it contains new nontrivial features necessary to overcome challenges arising from the non - uniform eigenvalue density @xmath81 , reflecting absence of translational invariance for the gue at the global spectral scale ( note e.g. the non - trivial recentering in ) .",
    "all this makes actual calculation for the gue much more involved in comparison to the cue and the limiting random variable @xmath82 above appears to be more complicated than its cue counterpart .",
    "secondly , we will test our conjecture with numerical experiments for matrices of size @xmath16 and around @xmath83 realizations .",
    "this is especially important as part of our analysis is based on very plausible but as yet not fully rigorous considerations .",
    "finally , is natural to expect that the same distribution should be shared by the maximum modulus of characteristic polynomials for hermitian random matrices with independent entries taken from the so - called wigner ensembles , see @xcite .    before giving the detail of our procedure in the next section we need to quote the following fundamental asymptotic result obtained by krasovsky @xcite which will be central for our considerations : @xmath84 \\label{krasov}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 and @xmath24 is the barnes g - function . differentiating with respect to @xmath86",
    ", we deduce that @xmath87 where we used that @xmath88 .",
    "the most salient feature of the asymptotics is the product of differences on the second line , which when rewritten in the form @xmath89 , \\label{kracovstruct}\\ ] ] can be looked at as evidence of the limiting gaussian process ( [ 1/fch ] ) with logarithmic covariance ( [ covop ] ) in the background .",
    "we will however stress that naively replacing the ( shifted ) @xmath90 with the corresponding @xmath55 noise ( [ 1/fch ] ) is not a valid approximation as the factors @xmath91 in ( [ krasov ] ) do play an essential role in determining the extreme value statistics of @xmath92 .",
    "let us finally note that had we suppressed the factors @xmath93 the faithful description of @xmath90 would be that of the regularized lcg process with covariance ( [ covop ] ) , the position - dependent variance @xmath94 and the position - dependent mean @xmath95 .    *",

    "we acknowledge support from epsrc grant ep / j002763/1 `` '' .",
    "following the ideas of @xcite we recast the problem of computing the value of the global maximum of @xmath17 ( with an appropriate shift by the mean value ) as a statistical mechanics problem characterized by the partition function @xmath96 with the `` potential '' @xmath97 , inverse temperature @xmath98 and @xmath99-independent non - negative parameter @xmath100 . specifically",
    ", if we define the associated `` free energy '' as @xmath101 , then @xmath102.\\ ] ]    note that if compared to a similar partition function for the cue case the main new feature in is the factor @xmath103 .",
    "although naively the presence of such a factor may seem irrelevant when taking the limit @xmath104 , we will actually see that it plays a very important role in supporting our procedure of extracting the free energy for @xmath99 exceeding some critical value .",
    "now we aim to compute the integer moments of the partition function defined in : @xmath105 in the limit @xmath7 the leading asymptotics of the above integral can be extracted by replacing the factor @xmath106 with its asymptotics from . in this way one obtains @xmath107^{k}}\\prod_{j=1}^{k}(1-x_{j}^{2})^{\\frac{\\beta^{2}+q}{2}}\\prod_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq k}(2|x_{j}-x_{i}|)^{-2\\beta^{2}}\\,dx_{1}\\ldots dx_{k}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after changing variables @xmath108 the integral above assumes the form @xmath109^{k}}\\prod_{j=1}^{k}y_{j}^{\\frac{\\beta^{2}+q}{2}}(1-y_{j})^{\\frac{\\beta^{2}+q}{2}}\\prod_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq k}|y_{i}-y_{j}|^{-2\\beta^{2}}\\,dy_{1}\\ldots dy_{k}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath110 with the quantity @xmath111 being the well - known selberg integral @xcite : @xmath112^{k}}\\prod_{j=1}^{m}x_{j}^{a}(1-x_{j})^{b}\\prod_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq k}|x_{i}-x_{j}|^{-2\\gamma}\\,dx_{1}\\ldots dx_{k}\\\\ & = \\prod_{j=1}^{k}\\frac{\\gamma(a+1-(j-1)\\gamma)\\gamma(b+1-(j-1)\\gamma)\\gamma(1-j\\gamma)}{\\gamma(a+b+2-(k+j-2)\\gamma)\\gamma(1-\\gamma)}\\\\ & = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^{k}(1-\\gamma)}\\tilde{s}_{k}(a , b,-\\gamma)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is easy to see that the found expression for the partition function moments @xmath113 in ( [ momselb],[mompart ] ) is well - defined for any @xmath114 and for an _ integer _",
    "@xmath115 satisfying @xmath116 . to understand how to deal with the case @xmath117 , we recall that krasovsky s asymptotic formula ( [ krasov ] ) is valid only when all of the differences @xmath118 remain _ finite _ when @xmath7 , and should be replaced by a different expression when @xmath119",
    ". one can check that the divergence of the integral for @xmath120 is due precisely to the fact that these near degeneracies become important . relying on our experience with the corresponding situation for the cue @xcite case",
    "suggests that taking into account the correct short - scale cutoff cures the formal divergence , but changes the asymptotics of the moments @xmath113 with @xmath14 : namely , these become of the order of @xmath121 for @xmath122 whereas they are of the order of @xmath123 for @xmath124 . such a change of behaviour will lead to a log - normal ( far ) tail in the distribution .",
    "note that for the cue case , the above behaviour conjectured in @xcite was validated by recent rigorous calculation @xcite . there is no doubt that the same mechanism is operational in present case as well and will be validated by extending the theory of @xcite from toeplitz to hankel case",
    "actually , as argued in @xcite the moments with @xmath122 play only a secondary role when addressing the question of extreme value statistics which is controlled exclusively by moments with @xmath125 .",
    "our next goal is to use the latter integer moments for restoring the associated part of the probability density @xmath126 for the partition function .",
    "this will be achieved if we manage to find the distribution for a random variable @xmath127 whose positive integer moments are given by @xmath128 such a task actually requires finding a way to continue analytically those moments to _ complex _ @xmath115 .",
    "below we will arrive at the required continuation by exploiting a relatively simple heuristic procedure suggested in @xcite .",
    "note that in a series of insightful papers @xcite ostrovsky developed a rigorous mathematical procedure of the required continuation which provides an _ aposteriori _ justification of the results obtained via the heuristic approach .",
    "one starts with finding a recursion satisfied by @xmath129 for integer @xmath115 which is suitable for the continuation . by writing @xmath130 one sees immediately that @xmath131 it is convenient to introduce the moments @xmath132 of the random variable @xmath133 defined for any complex @xmath134 as @xmath135 .",
    "we then have @xmath136 and after identifying @xmath137 the recursion ( [ rec1 ] ) takes the form @xmath138 which is now assumed to be valid for any complex @xmath134 . it is convenient to further use the duplication formula for the gamma function : @xmath139 to get rid of the argument @xmath140 in the denominator . indeed , we have @xmath141 so that ( [ rec2 ] ) assumes the form @xmath142 recalling that according to ( [ zreduced ] ) in our particular case @xmath143 we now use the parameterisation @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath99-independent constants @xmath146 . after this",
    "we finally arrive at @xmath147 to determine the function @xmath132 which satisfies ( [ rec4 ] ) for any complex @xmath134 we follow @xcite and introduce a variant of the barnes function @xmath148 which for any @xmath149 is defined by : @xmath150 where @xmath151 .",
    "this function satisfies the so - called self - duality relation @xmath152 and further posesses a shift property that is central for our studies @xmath153 one can check that @xmath148 for @xmath154 coincides with the standard barnes function @xmath155 which is a unique solution of the recursion @xmath156 satisfying @xmath157 . similarly to the standard barnes function the general barnes @xmath148 has no poles and only zeroes located at @xmath158 , @xmath159 .",
    "a detailed discussion of properties of functions closely related to @xmath148 can be found in @xcite .",
    "let us now define a function @xmath160 of the complex argument @xmath134 by @xmath161 where @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "then a straightforward computation which relies on the identity following from ( [ gt1 ] ) @xmath164 shows that the ratio @xmath165 reproduces the right - hand side of ( [ rec4 ] ) from which we conclude @xmath166 which finally implies that @xmath167 where @xmath168 .",
    "together with , and the fact that @xmath169 , we obtain for @xmath170 : @xmath171      the pair ( [ momg])-([compmom ] ) solves the problem of finding the complex moments @xmath172 of the random variable @xmath127 for any complex @xmath134 , and @xmath170 .",
    "knowledge of such moments can be used to restore the probability distribution of @xmath127 , hence of the partition function @xmath173 , and of its logarithm ( the free energy ) for large @xmath174 .",
    "our goal is however to study the limit of the latter as @xmath175 and one therefore should have a way of extracting information on the distribution for @xmath176 . in doing this",
    "we rely on the _ freezing transition scenario _ for logarithmically correlated random landscapes .",
    "the background idea of such scenario goes back to @xcite and was further advanced and clarified in the series of works @xcite . in brief , this scenario predicts a phase transition at the critical value @xmath154 and amounts to the following principle :    _ thermodynamic quantities which for @xmath170 are * self - dual * functions of the inverse temperature @xmath99 , i.e. functions that remain invariant under the transformation @xmath177 , retain for all @xmath176 the value they acquired at the point of self - duality @xmath178 .",
    "_    although such a scenario is not yet proven mathematically in full generality and has the status of a conjecture supported by physical arguments and available numerics , recently a few nontrivial aspects of freezing were verified within rigorous probabilistic analysis , see e.g. @xcite for efforts in this direction .    within that scenario ,",
    "one of the main outcomes of the analysis performed in @xcite is that the self - dual object associated with the distribution of the partition function for logarithmically correlated landscapes is expected to be the appropriately defined laplace transform : @xmath179\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath180 is a typical scale of the partition function which is extracted from the asymptotic for the integer moments and in our case can be chosen as @xmath181^{2}}{g(2\\beta+1)\\gamma(1-\\beta^{2})}\\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^{q}.\\ ] ] moreover , defining the probability density @xmath182 by @xmath183 one can show that the double - sided laplace transform for such a probability density is related to the complex moments @xmath184 of the scaled partition function via the following relation ( see eq.(26 ) of @xcite ) @xmath185 actually , as shown in @xcite the freezing scenario implies that the variable @xmath21 whose probability density is given by @xmath186 is precisely the fluctuating part of the height of the global minimum of the random potential which is our main object of interest .",
    "note however that the scale @xmath187 diverges when approaching the critical point @xmath154 , and that the associated free energy @xmath188 is self - dual only in the leading order , given by @xmath189 .",
    "the latter term after freezing at @xmath154 yields the leading @xmath190 term in our conjecture eq.([predeq ] ) for the maximum , whereas the logarithmically divergent term @xmath191 after careful re - interpretation results in the second term @xmath192 , see @xcite for the detailed explanation of that mechanism .",
    "the procedure leaves however a certain arbitrariness in the terms of the order of unity in the mean free energy , hence in the overall shift of the position of the maximum .",
    "let us stress however that apart from such a shift , the shape of the distribution function recovered in the framework of the freezing paradigm is completely fixed by the procedure .    our strategy therefore will be to check if self - duality holds for the right - hand side combination in ( [ denmin ] ) when we substitute our expression for the moments . before we proceed , it will be helpful to further expand our expression .",
