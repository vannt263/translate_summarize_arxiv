    "there is considerable interest in measuring the evolution of the galaxy cluster mass function with redshift . in principle",
    ", such a measurement can test structure formation and constrain the cosmic expansion history .",
    "one of the observational challenges in such an undertaking is to identify all clusters in a particular volume ; the other is to reliably infer cluster mass from observable cluster properties , over a range of cluster redshifts .",
    "recent optical surveys , such as the red - sequence cluster survey ( rcs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and the sloan digital sky survey ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have found large numbers of clusters at moderate to high redshift , with @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . at the high redshift extent , where spectroscopic information can be difficult to obtain on a survey scale , various optical properties , such as richness or optical luminosity ,",
    "can be taken to be mass proxies , and have been shown to be strongly correlated with observables understood to be related to cluster mass , such as galaxy velocity dispersion and x - ray temperature ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to use optical richness ( or any other optical property ) as a mass proxy , understanding the evolution of the mass - richness relation is critical to extracting cosmological information , since any evolution in the relation must be separated from the evolution of the mass function . in particular , some care must be taken when attempting to extend the mass / observable relation to high redshift as many of these relations are computed using local data .",
    "previous work has shown that optically - selected , high - redshift clusters at a fixed optical richness are typically lower in temperature and underluminous in x - rays when compared to local clusters @xcite .",
    "since these clusters generally follow the local luminosity - temperature relationship , the low temperatures and luminosities are interpreted as an indication that the cluster galaxies are not in virial equilibrium with the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "however , it is important to account for the significant scatter in the relation between optical richness and x - ray luminosity , as an eddington - like bias will scatter points of lower than expected x - ray luminosity into an optically - selected sample ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . observing these high redshift clusters is thus an avenue to study how clusters approach equilibrium .",
    "rcs043938 - 2904.7  is part of a larger sample of high redshift , high richness rcs clusters selected for x - ray follow up observations .",
    "x - ray properties of the sample as a whole are described in a forthcoming paper by @xcite . here",
    "we present _ chandra _ x - ray observations and optical spectroscopy of this apparently rich , x - ray underluminous object . in ",

    "chandra _ pipeline .    the first observation of rcs043938 - 2904.7  ( obsid 3577 ) had a highly variable background and the second observation was kindly provided by the director of the _ chandra _ x - ray center to compensate .",
    "this second observation ( obsid 4438 ) had a low background and was analyzed by standard lightcurve methods to select the acceptable background rate intervals , keeping 28.7 ks of the total 28.8 ks .",
    "more care had to be taken with obsid 3577 because standard lightcurve methods eliminated more than three - quarters of the data as unusable .    in order to maximize the useful portion of the data",
    ", we took the following approach .",
    "we binned the data into 100-second segments and sorted them from lowest number of counts to highest number of counts .",
    "we assume that the cluster flux is constant in time .",
    "this means that the signal - to - noise ratio is highest in the bin with the least number of counts and lowest in the bin with the most counts .",
    "suppose then that there are @xmath14 signal counts in each bin and @xmath15 total counts in the first @xmath16 bins .",
    "since @xmath15 monotonically increases with @xmath16 , we want to find the lowest value of @xmath16 for which @xmath17 or equivalently , @xmath18 meaning that adding the data in the @xmath19 bin will reduce the total signal - to - noise ratio in our filtered data set .",
    "this determined the time intervals we included in our final data set independent of the source count rate . in total , 64.6 ks of the total 76.2 ks of data ( 85% ) from obsid 3577 were kept .",
    "these data were combined with the second observation ( obsid 4438 ) using the ciao script ` merge_all ` for a total good - data exposure time of 93.3 ks .",
    "the same script was used to create an exposure map and exposure - corrected image .",
    "the x - ray data were then filtered to the energy range of 0.3 - 7 kev and point sources were identified and removed using ` w`avdetect .",
    "pulse - height spectra and associated response files were created from a 100 pixel ( 49.2@xmath20 ) radius circular region around the x - ray centroid .",
    "background spectra were obtained from another 100 pixel radius circular region over 400 pixels ( 196.8@xmath20 ) away from the cluster center , though still from the same merged image .",
    "care was taken to choose the background region in a location where the two observations overlapped .",

    "the border between these sub - regions was chosen so that the annulus and the circle each contain roughly the same number of source counts .",
    "results are consistent with the isothermal assumption but provide no additional constraint .",
    "we extrapolated the mass profile to obtain @xmath26 , the radius at which the spherically - averaged cluster density is @xmath27 times the critical density at the cluster redshift , and @xmath28 , the cluster mass within @xmath26 .",
    "we evaluate these parameters for @xmath29200 , 500 and 2500 .",
    "we detect cluster emission above background to a radius of approximately @xmath30 , meaning that we see cluster emission from the majority of the area inside the aperture used for obtaining the spectral data ( @xmath31 versus the spectral aperture of 49.2@xmath20 ) .",

    ", in preparation .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , rcs043938 - 2904.7  displays a clear double peak in the redshift histogram at @xmath63 .",
    "figure [ veldisfig ] shows a redshift histogram centered on the mean redshift of the two components , @xmath12 . only galaxies within a radius of 5 arcminutes , corresponding to a projected distance of @xmath64 mpc ,",
    "are considered .",
    "fitting a double - gaussian to the peaks yields central locations of the two peaks which are insensitive to the redshift quality class under consideration .",
    "the separation of the two peaks in the mean rest frame ranges from 3000  to 3250  depending on the redshift quality chosen .",
    "the difference between the two cases is comparable with the redshift uncertainty on a single measurement ( @xmath65 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    with the new spectroscopy",
    ", there are now enough redshifts to attempt to measure approximate velocity dispersions for the two components .",
    "using all galaxies of redshift quality 4 or better gives : @xmath66  for the @xmath0=0.9435 component and @xmath67  for the @xmath0=0.9681 component , where the errors are based on jackknife uncertainties as in @xcite .",
    "such velocity dispersions would correspond to masses of @xmath68 m@xmath69 and @xmath70 m@xmath69 respectively @xcite .",
    "however , velocity dispersion estimates based on so few points may be biased and the formal uncertainties are large enough that the values are consistent with both components having equal velocity dispersions .",
    "we note that both peaks in the velocity histogram contain approximately equal numbers of galaxies and use this , coupled with the velocity dispersion uncertainties , to adopt the conservative assumption that both systems have approximately equal masses .",
    "refined mass estimates from dynamics will require more redshifts and such work is ongoing .",
    "figure [ rgbfig ] shows the spatial distribution of these galaxies on the sky in a composite r , i and k band image , overlaid with x - ray contours .",
    "contours begin @xmath71 , assuming poisson statistics , above the average number of counts per pixel in the entire image ( which is essentially the background ) , and are spaced in 0.25@xmath72 intervals .",
    "figure [ contourfig ] shows the same x - ray contours along with rcs galaxy overdensity contours , starting at 2@xmath72 and spaced in 0.25@xmath72 increments , as well as the positions of galaxies with measured spectroscopic redshifts , including field galaxies and galaxies from each of the two redshift peaks .",
    "the two redshift peaks overlap in position on the sky and thus it is not possible to say for certain which system is responsible for the x - ray emission measured , or whether both systems contribute , though the latter seems most likely . from figures",
    "[ rgbfig ] and [ contourfig ] it can be seen that the peak of the x - ray emission is nearly coincident with the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) of the @xmath0=0.94 cluster , and that the emission is elongated in the direction of the @xmath0=0.96 cluster s bcg .",
    "this adds further support to the idea that the observed x - ray emission is likely due to a combination of emission from each of the two systems .",
    "figure [ mbfig ] , as noted above , shows  plotted against m@xmath73 for our rcs043938 - 2904.7  and a selection of other rcs clusters .",
    "rcs043938 - 2904.7  lies well outside the region bounded by the 1-@xmath72 scatter , appearing significantly richer than its x - ray mass would suggest .",
    "this is not surprising given that the spectroscopy discussed above suggests that rcs043938 - 2904.7  is an extended structure containing two comparable , less rich systems .",
    "since these systems lie so close together in redshift that their red sequences overlap , the red - sequence  measurement is the sum of that of both these systems . a more reasonable estimate of the true richness associated with the measured mass x - ray mass , in light of the double - peaked velocity distribution , would be to halve the measured .",
    "doing so brings the x - ray mass and the richness mass into agreement , within the large scatter .",
    "rcs043938 - 2904.7  has an inferred x - ray mass which is one to two orders of magnitude lower than the mass indicated by its red - sequence richness , assuming that the x - ray emission is from a single , spherical , isothermal gas distribution and that the richness is associated with a single cluster ( @xmath74 m@xmath69 versus @xmath75 dex m@xmath69 ) .",
    "this is a significant discrepancy for two reasons .",
    "first , as mentioned before , richness is well correlated on average with other observable properties .",
    "secondly , clusters with masses above @xmath76 m@xmath69 are quite rare , especially at @xmath77 .",
    "this means that if the richness mass estimate of rcs043938 - 2904.7  were truly indicative of its size , it would be among the largest overdensities in the observable universe , while also being very underluminous .",
    "yet the x - ray properties , which suggest a much less massive object , are consistent with the expected @xmath28@xmath3 and @xmath2@xmath3 relations , meaning that the temperature of the plasma is consistent with its observed distribution",
    ". one possible interpretation of these results is that the red - sequence galaxies used to measure the optical richness and the x - ray emitting gas trace different volumes .",
    "specifically , while the x - ray luminous plasma is confined within one or more deep gravitational potential wells , the galaxy population may occupy a more extended region which is not yet dynamically relaxed .",
    "the existence of such a structure in rcs043938 - 2904.7  is supported by its two - peaked radial velocity distribution .",
    "merging and dynamically active clusters are expected and observed to be increasingly common at higher redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus any cluster sample will include an increasing fraction of dynamically young systems at higher redshift .",
    "furthermore , n - body simulations indicate that a significant fraction of cluster samples selected using broadband color discrimination will be systems whose galaxy members are not predominantly associated with a single , large potential well , but rather are spread amongst a number of smaller , but still physically associated , dark matter halos distributed along the line - of - sight @xcite .",
    "simulations of the rcs technique on mock catalogs tuned to reproduce observables such as the observed galaxy color distribution and the two - point correlation function show that we expect false - positive cluster detections to occur at a frequency of @xmath15% in the rcs @xcite .",
    "this agrees with initial results based on a small number of clusters @xcite .",
    "since the red - sequence galaxies used in the rcs richness measurements form very early ( @xmath78 ) in high density regions , overdensities of red - sequence galaxies can be associated with very large structures which may not be relaxed during the observed epoch .",
    "the x - ray luminous plasma , on the other hand , will be confined to one or more gravitational potential wells whose size is limited by the collapse timescale . in the hierarchical collapse paradigm of a @xmath7cdm universe , the large , virialized wells seen in local clusters do not develop until long after the galaxies have formed . in this scenario , for any evolving cluster , there is likely to be an epoch at which the apparent richness overestimates the virialized mass .",
    "moreover , the misinterpretation of the x - ray emission from a complex , dynamically young cluster as a single , virialized structure can lead to an overestimate of the inferred gas mass fraction and an underestimate of the total mass , which can be seen as follows .",
    "let us consider two models for the x - ray emission seen in rcs043938 - 2904.7 .",
    "our one - component model ( model i ) is the set of assumptions used in our x - ray analysis thus far : x - ray emission is from a single , spherically - symmetric distribution of gas in hydrostatic equilibrium with a gravitational potential which is well - described by a @xmath21-model . the two - component model ( model ii )",
    "assumes that there are two nominally identical ( i.e.  with the same values of @xmath21 , @xmath79 and @xmath3 ) , virialized gas distributions , separated along the line of sight , and that each of the two gas distributions is responsible for half of the measured x - ray flux .",
    "each component is assumed to obey the local @xmath28@xmath3 and @xmath2@xmath3 relation .    because it assumes the flux is halved between the two components , the luminosity inferred per cluster in model ii is half that of model i. the luminosity scales as the square of the gas mass , so",
    "since the spatial distribution is the same for each cluster , the inferred gas mass and thus also the electron density will be reduced by a factor of @xmath80 in each of the clusters relative to model i. since our total mass estimate for each cluster depends only on the temperature of the x - ray emitting gas and its distribution in the plane of the sky , each of the two components in model ii will have the same total mass as the single component in model i. this means that the inferred gas mass fraction will be a factor of @xmath80 lower using model ii versus model i. the total mass , total gas mass and gas mass fraction results using each of the two models can be found in table [ masstable ] .",
    "similarly , @xmath16 identical components along the line of sight would reduce the inferred gas mass per component and the overall gas mass fraction by a factor of @xmath81 in addition to reducing the luminosity per component by a factor of @xmath16 . in principle , luminosity measurements and the @xmath2@xmath3 relation constrain the number of components allowed , but our luminosity errors are too large to distinguish between model i and model ii .",
    "@xcite , using a suite of hydrodynamic cluster simulations , found that during merger events the icm spectral fit temperature will underestimate the mass - weighted icm temperature by @xmath82 , because the cool , denser inflowing gas will dominate the emission over the gas already heated by the merger .",
    "this means that for a dynamically young system , such as rcs043938 - 2904.7 , where even the most virialized components are likely to have undergone recent mergers , x - ray mass estimates for those clusters may still be below the virialized masses by several tens of percent . in a recent detailed study of the cluster cl 0024 + 17",
    ", @xcite found a similar underestimation of the true mass distribution due to the assumption of a single virialized mass structure rather than two components extended along the line of sight and in a state of ongoing dynamic interaction .    in summary , the assumption of spherical symmetry and virial equilibrium for a cluster system containing extended line - of - sight structure and dynamic evolution can lead to overestimation of the gas mass fraction and underestimation of the total mass .",
    "the baryon mass fraction in relaxed galaxy clusters is expected to be a universal quantity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that the comparison of cluster gas mass fractions inferred by assuming spherical symmetry to canonical cluster values might be used to infer the presence of line - of - sight structure . as noted by @xcite , the cosmological baryon mass ratio , @xmath83 ,",
    "provides an upper limit to the total gas mass fraction .",
    "this ratio from the wmap three - year data results is @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "galaxy cluster samples at high redshift are expected to have lower cluster gas mass fractions than local samples ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. , ) .",
    "also , a positive correlation between temperature and gas mass fraction has been observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that a high - redshift cluster with a low x - ray temperature , such as rcs043938 - 2904.7 , ought to have a correspondingly low gas mass fraction .",
    "instead , we observe a very high gas mass fraction assuming that it is a single , spherical matter distribution , especially measured within a large radius . at @xmath30 ,",
    "we find @xmath85 .",
    "we observe cluster emission to approximately this radius , so this gas mass fraction estimate is unlikely to have the extrapolation errors that the measurement at @xmath49 might . assuming that model ii is more appropriate for the physical state of rcs043938 - 2904.7  lowers the gas mass fraction towards what is expected .",
    "would this pair of clusters be physically associated ? as an order - of - magnitude argument , we note that the richness mass ( @xmath11@xmath86 m@xmath69 ) is roughly equal to that of a sphere of radius @xmath113 mpc with the cosmic density of @xmath87 .",
    "optical spectroscopy shows that the redshift separation of the two components in rcs043938 - 2904.7  is @xmath88 , or a physical separation of about 12 mpc in the hubble flow .",
    "this rough agreement supports the conclusion that rcs043938 - 2904.7   is an incompletely - virialized system which is still approaching equilibrium , and that the galaxy distribution traces unvirialized matter extended along the line - of - sight , as well as the virialized matter traced by the x - ray gas .",
    "the free - fall collapse time for the two components given by the richness mass is approximately equal to the lookback time , indicating that this cluster would be nearly virialized by about the present epoch .",
    "additional observations are required to determine the physical state of rcs043938 - 2904.7 . due to the low number of source photons from this cluster , there are large errors in the x - ray luminosity and temperature",
    ". improvements on both would increase the precision of the x - ray mass estimates and the gas mass fractions .",
    "an independent mass estimate , such as might be obtained from weak lensing , could also help distinguish which mass estimate ( richness or x - ray ) is more appropriate , as well as giving additional insight into the distribution of matter",
    ". a weak lensing measurement , though difficult , would be particularly interesting for this system if it could trace the spatial distribution of cluster mass perpendicular to the line of sight , possibly revealing more substructure .",
    "additional spectroscopy , currently underway , will help to further constrain line - of - sight substructure .",

    "spectroscopy of rcs043938 - 2904.7  shows a two - peaked velocity distribution , suggesting substructure along the line - of - sight .",
    "assuming that there is a single , virialized mass distribution in rcs043938 - 2904.7  results in gas mass fraction measurements which are higher than others in the rcs , which may also indicate line - of - sight structure .",
    "accounting for the substructure with a two - component model for the mass distribution brings the richness mass into agreement with the x - ray mass and the gas mass fractions into agreement with expected values .",
    "weak lensing measurements , additional x - ray observations and additional spectroscopy would be useful in further constraining both the total amount of mass in the system and its distribution .",
