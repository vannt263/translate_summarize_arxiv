    "this is always true for the envelopes of maxima , however , the envelope of minima are affected by the fine structure of the bump and its phase shift along the light curve and changing shapes .",
    "these variations in the shock are associated to the blazhko modulation such a way that a displacement of the shock forming region occurs over the blazhko cycle .",
    "this induces an earlier or later occurrence of the bump in the light curves ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if these variations are strong enough , the envelope curve of minima could be different from our simple modulated ones .",
    "( ii ) we showed that am with extremely high modulation depth ( @xmath361 ) might be an explanation for the strange light curve shape of v445lyrae observed by _",
    "kepler_. ( iii ) when the am function depends on more than one frequency , ( in a parallel or cascade modulation ) we can generate envelope curves with different observed phenomena such as beating effect , alternating maxima , long - term , periodic amplitude changes .",
    "* _ fourier spectra of am cases _ can be easily classified ( see also table  [ sema ] ) . for a periodic modulation the signal represented by a finite fourier sum",
    "the spectrum of the synthetic light curve shows the modulation frequency , multiplets around the pulsation frequency and its harmonics , as well .",
    "the order of multiplets ( the number of peaks on one side ) is the same as the used number of terms for describing the modulation function . as a special case , the sinusoidal modulation results in triplet structures and the appearance of @xmath39 only . for a multiperiodic parallel modulation ,",
    "the spectrum consists of a sum of the frequencies of each component modulation , while in the case of modulated modulation ( am cascade ) spectra includes additional peaks at the all possible linear combination frequencies , as well . *   for all am cases the fourier _ amplitude of the side frequencies _ are proportional to the given harmonics amplitude , therefore , the numbers and the side peak amplitude ratios compared to the central frequencies are the same for all orders of harmonics .",
    "pure am results in symmetrical multiplets : side frequencies of the same order have the same amplitudes .",
    "*   the _ variation of the mean brightness _ through the blazhko cycle is a consequence of the am modulation .",
    "the effect appears even for the simplest sinusoidal modulation function , and is closely related to the appearance of the modulation frequency itself in the fourier spectrum . * pure _ fm light curves _ have no amplitude changes but significant phase variations .",
    "their fourier spectra show multiplet structure around the pulsation frequency and its harmonics even for the simplest sinusoidal modulation .",
    "as opposed to am the detectable number of side peaks is increasing with the increasing harmonic orders .",
    "the modulation frequencies ( and their harmonics ) are absent in the spectra .",
    "the side peaks structure can be symmetrical ( for sinusoidal modulation ) or asymmetrical ( most of the non - sinusoidal cases ) .",
    "the non - sinusoidal fm can be characterized by the classical o@xmath0c tool .",
    "the multifrequency fm spectra include all possible linear combination frequencies in the parallel case .",
    "*   the _ fourier amplitude ratio of the side peaks vs. harmonic orders _ are determined by the bessel functions of the first kind ( for the sinusoidal case ) or their product ( for the non - sinusoidal case ) . as a consequence , these relationships are generally non - strictly decreasing with the increasing harmonic orders .",
    "therefore , we can find larger amplitudes for the higher - order side peaks than for the lower - orders ones for comparing the same order of side peaks around different harmonics and different order of side peaks around a given harmonic .",
    "the latter can be true also for the amplitude of the side peaks and the central peaks ( the harmonics ) amplitude .",
    "*   the simultaneous am and fm show all the above mentioned effects .",
    "the side peaks amplitudes in the fourier spectra of the combined modulations are generally asymmetrical already for sinusoidal am and fm .",
    "the asymmetry can totally remove side peak(s ) in one side .",
    "the strength of asymmetry depends on the initial phase difference of the am and fm modulation functions .",
    "this phase difference determines both the inclination and direction of motion of the loop in the maximum brightness vs. maximum phase diagram . *   in the case of the pure sinusoidal am and fm ( and with very special parameters for non - sinusoidal and combined cases as well ) , there are well - defined phases where the modulated and non - modulated light curves are identical .",
    "however , we have pointed out that , when a star shows general combined modulation ( even a sinusoidal one ) , its light curve is always different from any monoperiodic ( non - modulated ) stars . *   we showed that our modulation description presented here needs much ( typically 310 times ) less parameters for fitting a light curve than the classical solution , where all detected frequencies have their own independent amplitude and phase . the prize to pay for",
    "the relatively small number of parameters is the more complicated fitting formulae .",
    "our approach fits the light curves only once , instead of the traditional successive prewhitening process , and unaffected by most aliasing problems .",
    "it is equally important to list those observed features that do not follow this picture .",
    "one of these effects is the _ phase lag _ , a difference between the blazhko phases of maxima of maxima and minima of minima of the modulated light curves .",
    "these phase lags can be several pulsation cycles long . in our study , however , all envelopes are highly symmetrical : their maxima and minima are practically at the same blazhko phases .",
    "if we see the well - sampled observed light curves ( e.g. _ corot _ or _ kepler _ data ) showing this phase lag , we can realise that the effect builds up from the systematic motions and changing the shape of the bump caused by the hydrodynamical shock in the rrlyrae atmospheres .",
    "an additional unsolved problem is the _ distribution of the side peaks asymmetry_. the large surveys ( ogle , macho ) found that the spectra of blazhko rrlyrae stars more frequently contain asymmetrical side frequency patterns , where the higher frequency side peaks have the higher amplitude than vice versa ( e.g. 74 vs. 26 per - cents for lmc by @xcite ) .",
    "all formulae suggest 50 - 50 per - cents of probabilities , if the distribution of the relative phases between am and fm is uniform .",
    "the detected asymmetrical distribution might have deeper physical origin .",
    "our description does not explain the _ additional frequencies _ such as half - integer frequencies belonging to period doubling , temporary overtone frequencies and further exotic frequencies in the fourier spectra , recently discovered from the space data @xcite .",
    "their connection with the physics of blazhko effect is poorly understood and their modelling is out of the scope of this paper .    the main result of this analysis is the demonstration that the modulation paradigm gives successfully accounts for most of the observed properties of blazhko rrlyrae light curves . moreover ,",
    "this work may help to distinguish between those features that have deeper physical origin from those ones which appear simply due to the modulation .",

    "<S> we present an analytical formalism for the description of blazhko rrlyrae light curves in which employ a treatment for the amplitude and frequency modulations in a manner similar to the theory of electronic signal transmitting . </S>",
    "<S> we assume monoperiodic rr lyrae light curves as carrier waves and modulate their amplitude ( am ) , frequency ( fm ) , phase ( pm ) , and as a general case we discuss simultaneous am and fm . </S>",
    "<S> the main advantages of this handling are the following : ( i ) the mathematical formalism naturally explains numerous light curve characteristics found in blazhko rrlyrae stars such as mean brightness variations , complicated envelope curves , non - sinusoidal frequency variations . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) our description also explains properties of the fourier spectra such as apparent higher - order multiplets , amplitude distribution of the side peaks , the appearance of the modulation frequency itself and its harmonics . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , comparing to the traditional method , our light curve solutions reduce the number of necessary parameters . </S>",
    "<S> this formalism can be applied to any type of modulated light curves , not just for blazhko rrlyrae stars .    </S>",
