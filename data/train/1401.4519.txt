    "in collisionless space environment , wave - particle interactions can dominate over fluid or collisional processes , resulting in , e.g. , temperature anisotropy , which is a common phenomenon that has been observed in the solar corona and solar wind for a long time @xcite .",

    "it is not clear if high - frequency alfvn / ion - cyclotron waves can be produced in sufficient quantities to explain the levels of proton heating that are observed . according to observations ,",
    "it is unlikely that the cascade of both non - compressive mhd fluctuations and compressive magnetosonic waves are a significant source of high - frequency ion - cyclotron fluctuations in the near - earth solar wind@xcite .",
    "dissipation of low - frequency alfvn turbulence , rather than high frequency ion - cyclotron waves , offers an alternative explanation for perpendicular ion heating in the solar wind , indicating heating occurs at @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the frequency of the alfvn waves and @xmath13 denotes the gyrofrequency for ion species labeled _ i _ ) .",
    "many viable theories requiring the dissipation of waves through low frequency alfvn wave - particle interaction have been proposed , such as stochastic heating@xcite , nonresonant wave - particle scattering@xcite , parametric instabilities@xcite and superadiabatic acceleration@xcite .",
    "results from simulations showed a reasonable agreement with those obtained from analytical theories . among various proposed models ,",

    "therefore , nonresonant wave - particle scattering may also be important in some circumstances .    meanwhile , the shape of velocity distribution functions ( vdfs ) due to wave activity has been widely discussed recently@xcite .",
    "the deformation of vdfs with respect to a maxwellian shape caused by the presence of wave field forces ( or their spectra ) may mimic genuine heating .",
    "the wave field forces would lead to a velocity spread after appropriately averaging over the wave effects , which results in an effective non - thermal broadening of the vdfs similar to real heating process @xcite .",
    "therefore , this process has been named as `` pseudoheating '' and the corresponding temperature as `` apparent temperature '' @xcite .",
    "the characteristics of wave effect on the vfds are reversible and non - dissipative .",
    "thus , it does not represent the genuine heating and the correlated particle motion is nonthermal .",
    "interestingly , pseudoheating can mimic the perpendicular heating as described above , especially when the wave amplitude is large@xcite . in the case of finite amplitude low - frequency alfvve wave",
    ", both nonresonant wave - particle scattering and pseudoheating could happen within one ion gyroperiod , thus distinguishing pseudoheating from real heating is important @xcite .",

    "in other words , it requires the coupling between the test particle model and the alfvn turbulence mhd model .",
    "one possible explanation for the down loop structure is that for cpaws , the non - resonant heating finishes in a short time scale that is on the order of one ion cyclotron period , thus the alfvn waves damp before they have a chance to propagate upward in the low latitude closed field regions .",
    "in summary , the analytic solutions of non - resonant heating , especially for a spectrum of lpaws , are presented .",
    "the heating is dominant in the direction perpendicular to the background magnetic field . the perpendicular heating , @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the perpendicular temperature of species @xmath4 before and after genuine heating , respectively ) , in the spectrum of cpaws is about a factor of two stronger than that of lpaws .",
    "the analytic solutions reproduce the preferential perpendicular heating of solar wind minor heavy ions to a certain degree , in good agreement with the test @xmath10-particle simulation results .",
