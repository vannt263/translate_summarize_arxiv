    "one of the most attractive solutions to the strong cp problem is to introduce a spontaneously broken peccei - quinn symmetry @xcite . this solution originally predicted a pseudo - goldstone boson , the so - called peccei - quinn - weinberg - wilczek axion @xcite , which is ruled out phenomenologically .",
    "the subsequently devised invisible axion @xcite is also constrained to a narrow band on the axion decay constant @xmath0 .",
    "some astrophysical arguments , e.g. those associated with the axion emission from helium burning red giants or the supernova sn1987a @xcite , imply that @xmath0 is far above the weak scale .",
    "a natural possibility is then that @xmath0 is around the grand unification scale or the planck scale . as is well known , however , the coherent axion oscillation in the early universe gives rise to relic axions whose mass density @xmath1 ( in the unit of the critical energy density ) at present is given by @xcite _ a=(a / f_a)^2(f_a/410 ^ 12 gev)^1.18 , where @xmath2 is the axion misalignment at the epoch of the qcd phase transition .",
    "clearly it is most natural to assume that the axion misalignment is of order @xmath0 . requring the axion mass density",
    "not significantly exceed the critical density , this leads to the upper bound @xmath3 gev which is far below the grand unification scale or the planck scale .    one way to raise up",
    "the cosmological upper bound on @xmath0 is to have an entropy production after the qcd phase transition @xcite .",
    "however it has been argued that , due to constraints from the nucleosynthesis , one can not reach above few times @xmath4 gev by this late time entropy production @xcite .",
    "recently another interesting way to raise up the axion bound was suggested by dvali @xcite .",
    "the idea is to suppress the axion misalignment @xmath2 by assuming a period of stronger qcd in the early universe during which the qcd coupling constant takes a value larger than the present one .",
    "clearly this would be possible only when the qcd coupling constant is determined by a dynamical degree of freedom in the theory , e.g. a dilaton field @xmath5 whose vacuum expectation value ( vev ) gives @xmath6 .",
    "if the dilaton takes a value smaller than the present one , the qcd at that time would be stronger , leading to the corresponding scale @xmath7 _ far bigger _ than the present value of order @xmath8 gev .",
    "then there is a possibility that a large effective axion mass is induced in the early universe , driving the axion field toward the minimum of the effective potential .",
    "if the minimum of the early axion potential coincides with the minimum of the present axion potential , @xmath2 would be dynamically suppressed , allowing the upper bound of @xmath0 larger than @xmath9 gev .",

    "we stress that the second condition in eq .",
    "( 2 ) for the early minimum to coincide with the present one should be satisfied _ without _ fine tuning of some field values which would be _ chaotic _ in the early universe .",
    "such fine tuning is certainly nothing better than the simpler fine tuning of the chaotic axion field @xmath23 to @xmath15 at the epoch of qcd phase transition .    in this paper , we wish to examine whether the axion misalgnment can be relaxed by a stronger qcd in the early universe in supersymmetric models . to start with , we assume that the dilaton dynamics in the model allows a period in the early universe",
    "during which qcd becomes stronger .",
    "the reason for limiting the analysis to supersymmetric models is clear : the most natural playground of the dilaton field is supersymmetric model .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we provide a discussion of the axion potential in the early universe by distinguishing the two cases , one in which @xmath7 is smaller than the size of soft supersymmetry breaking parameter @xmath24 and the other opposite case that the qcd becomes so strong that @xmath25 .",
    "we discuss the second case in somewhat detail since the axion potential in this case has not been considered in the previous literature .",
    "as we will see , the axion potential in the second case dramatically differs from the well known axion potential in the first case .",
    "based on this analysis , in section 3 we examine whether the two conditions given in eq .",
    "( 2 ) can be simultaneously met .",
    "taking into account the dilaton potential energy , we will argue that it is very _",
    "unlikely _ to have a cosmological scenario in which both of these two conditions are satisfied .",
    "we thus conclude in section 4 that a stronger qcd in the early universe is _ not _ useful for raising the cosmological upper bound of the axion decay constant @xmath0 .",
    "in this section , we present a somewhat detailed discussion of the axion potential in the early universe . in the early universe , field variables would take chaotic values if their effective masses are smaller than the expansion rate @xmath26 . in order to satisfy eq .",
    "( 2 ) without fine tuning , one needs to keep the axion vev _ not _ shifted by such chaotic fields . if not , the axion vev in the early universe would become chaotic and thus not coincide with the present axion vev in general .",
    "we will thus assume that field variables which apparently affect the axion vev are _ not _ chaotic , _ but _ quickly settle into the minimum of their effective potential in the early universe .",
    "of course , one still needs to confirm that these fields settled at the minimum leads to an early axion vev almost the same as the present one as given in eq .",
    "( 2 ) .    to compute the axion potential in the early universe , it is convenient to distinguish the following two cases : @xmath27    let us first consider the case that @xmath28 . in this case , if there is no light quark whose current mass is less than @xmath7 , the axion potential is given by v_a_qcd^4 ( a / f_a-_in ) , where @xmath29 denotes the qcd vacuum angle _ in the early universe_. the presence of light quarks suppresses the axion potential as v_am_q_qcd^3 ( a / f_a-_in ) , where @xmath30 @xmath31 is the current mass of the _ lightest _ quark .    of course , it depends upon the higgs vevs in the early universe whether there exists a light quark with @xmath32 .",
    "in fact , the higgs vevs in the early universe can dramatically differ from the present ones . to be explicit ,",
    "let us consider the minimal supersymmetric standard model . in this model ,",
    "the higgs potential for the neutral components takes the form m_1 ^ 2|h_u|^2+m_2 ^ 2|h_d|^2+(bh_uh_d+h.c . ) + ( g_2 ^",
    "2+g_1 ^ 2)(|h_u|^2-|h_d|^2)^2 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote the two higgs doublets in the model . in generic supersymmetric models ,",
    "soft parameters are determined by the vevs of fields triggering spontaneous susy breaking . as a result ,",
    "soft parameters in the early universe may take values which differ from the present ones .",
    "in particular , both the sign and magnitude of @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the early unverse can differ from the present ones due to an additional susy breaking by nonzero energy density .",
    "this change of @xmath35 and @xmath36 does not alter @xmath37 and thus _ not _ lead to a change of the early axion vev .",
    "however it can dramatically change @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "for instance , if both @xmath35 and @xmath36 are positive and large enough , the higgs vevs do vanish .",
    "then all quarks become massless and the axion potential vanishes up to a tiny contribution from small instantons . in the opposite case that both @xmath35 and @xmath36 are negative , the higgs vevs slide down toward the flat direction @xmath40 . in this case",
    ", we would not have any light quark and the axion potential is given by ( 4 ) .",
    "finally for @xmath35 and @xmath36 leading to the higgs vevs similar to the present ones , the axion potential is given by ( 5 ) with the up quark mass @xmath41 mev .    in the above ,",
    "we have ignored a possible finite temperature effect on the axion potential . at high temperature @xmath42 , the axion potentials eq .",
    "( 4 ) and eq.(5 ) are _ not _ valid anymore . however ,",
    "compared to the low temperature result , the high temperature axion potential is suppressed by more powers of the light quark masses and also by @xmath43 @xcite . since what we wish to obtain is a bigger axion potential for a given value of @xmath7 , we will not consider such a high temperature case anymore .    in the above discussion , the higgs fields were assumed to stay at the minimum of the potential .",
    "it has been argued that in generic supergravity models a nonzero energy density @xmath44 in the early universe affects soft parameters as @xmath45 where @xmath26 is the hubble expansion rate and @xmath46 is a dimensionless constant @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath46 may be small due to small couplings or to loop suppression . if @xmath46 is small enough , it is possible that @xmath47 .",
    "such a large @xmath26 may result in chaotic higgs values in the early universe .",
    "however , in supersymmetric models with two higgs doublets @xmath33 and @xmath34 , chaotic higgs fields lead to a chaotic axion vev which differs from the present axion vev in general . furthermore , for @xmath48 , we have @xmath49 ( note that we have been discussing the case @xmath50 . ) and thus the first condition of eq .",
    "( 2 ) can _ not _ be satisfied also .",
    "we thus assume that @xmath51 and thus the higgs fields quickly settle into their vevs .",
    "let us now consider the opposite limit that the qcd becomes so strong that @xmath25 .",
    "then the axion potential is induced by nonperturbative supersymmetric qcd effects .",
    "recent progress in understanding the dynamics of supersymmetric gauge theories @xcite allows us to estimate the axion potential even in this case .",
    "as is well known , the axion potential is severely affected by gauge invariant condensates which break chiral symmetries in the theory .",
    "these condensates can be used to tie together fermion zero modes of the instanton amplitudes generating the axion potential .",
    "phase degrees of freedom of such condensates then mix with the axion field as the @xmath52 mixes with the axion in normal qcd @xcite .",
    "we thus study first what kind of chiral symmetry breaking condensates are formed in the supersymmetric qcd with the superpotential w=_u h_uqu^c+_d h_dqd^c , where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 denote @xmath56 doublet quarks and singlet antiquarks , respectively . here",
    ", the generation indices and gauge group indices are omitted for simplicity .",
    "it has been argued that , for a vanishing superpotential , the quantum moduli space of degenerate vacua for supersymmetric @xmath57 gauge theory with @xmath58 quark flavors is the same as the classical one @xcite .",
    "such a vacuum degeneracy is lifted in fact by the yukawa terms in the superpotential and also by soft breaking terms @xcite . as was observed recently ,",
    "the infrared behavior of gauge invariant operators in supersymmetric @xmath59 gauge theory with @xmath60 quark flavors can be studied by the dual @xmath61 theory with @xmath60 dual quarks @xcite .",
    "the superpotential of the dual model contains w_d=_qcd(_u h_ut_u+_d h_d t_d)+ t_uq_du_d^c+t_dq_dd_d^c , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 denote the meson superfields with dimension one at the ultraviolet , while @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 are the dual quark and anti - quark superfields .",
    "once the supersymmetry of the original model is broken by soft parameters much less than @xmath7 , the dual model will contain soft terms @xcite _ soft^(d)=aw_d+m_i^2|_i|^2 , where @xmath67 denotes generic scalar fields in the dual model and the soft parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 are again much less than @xmath7 .",
    "a nice feature of the dual theory is that it becomes weaker as the original qcd becomes stronger , allowing a classical approximation to be valid .",
    "the classical effective potential of the dual model can be readily computed from the superpotential ( 8) and the soft terms ( 9 ) .",
    "it is then easy to see that , for @xmath7 large enough compared to @xmath24 , the higgs fields @xmath70 and the linear combinations @xmath71 and @xmath72 of mesons have _ positive _ mass squared of order @xmath73 , and thus have _ vanishing _ vev s .",
    "for the original squarks having _ positive _ soft mass squared , it is expected that both the mesons and the dual squarks also have positive soft mass squared .",
    "note that the mesons are the bound states of the original squarks and anti - squarks , while the dual squarks can be obtained by dissociating the scalar baryons ( containing @xmath74 original squarks ) into @xmath75 pieces . with positive",
    "soft mass squared , the vevs of the dual squarks and the entire mesons _ vanish _ also .",
    "the above results on the vevs can be summarized as @xmath76 @xmath77 t^n_f/(n_f - n_c)=0 , where @xmath78 denotes the scalar components of the meson superfields @xmath79 with the auxiliary components @xmath80 .",
    "thus all of the squark condensates @xmath81 , the quark condensates @xmath82 , and the gluino condensate @xmath83 do vanish .",
    "note that the vanishing of the gluino condensate is essentially due to the vanishing higgs vev leading to the massless quarks .",
    "although the above chiral invariant vacuum configurations were derived based on the classical potential at zero temperature , it is rather easy to see neither quantum corrections ( due to the weak dual gauge interactions ) nor finite temperature effects does shift these chiral invariant configurations .",
    "so far , we have argued that the mesons and the dual squarks have vanishing vevs for @xmath25 . again if the expansion rate @xmath26 is large enough so that @xmath84 , the mesons and dual squarks would have chaotic values although their effective potential is minimal at zero values . note that the dual squarks and the mesons ( except for @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) have masses of order @xmath24 .",
    "chaotic values of the mesons and the dual squarks correspond to chaotic condensates of the quarks , squarks , and gluino .",
    "clearly the axion vev determined by such chaotic condensates will be _ chaotic _ also , and thus does _ not _ coincide in general with the present axion vev .",
    "thus to avoid a chaotic axion vev , we assume that @xmath85 and the mesons and the dual squarks quickly settle into the minimum of their effective potential .    in the case that there is _ no _ condensate , the axion potential is given by the qcd instanton amplitudes whose fermion zero modes are tied together by the interactions which break the chiral symmetries explicitly @xcite . to proceed ,",
    "let us consider the minimal supersymmetric standard model having the superpotential w=_uh_uqu^c+_dh_dqd^c+h_uh_d , and the soft terms _",
    "soft= m_1/2+a(_u h_u^c + _ d h_d^c)+bh_uh_d + m_i^2 |_i|^2+h.c . , where @xmath86 denotes generic scalar fields in the model .",
    "in order to compute the instanton - induced axion potential , we first note that the model is invariant under g_mssm= su(3)_qsu(3)_u^csu(3)_d^c u(1)_au(1)_xu(1)_r , where the fields and parameters transform as @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 under @xmath92 , and the quantum numbers of @xmath93 are given in table 1 .",
    "as is well known , the soft supersymmetry breaking can be described within superspace formalism by introducing spurion superfields : @xmath94",
    "@xmath95 @xmath96 where the auxiliary components of the spurion superfields represent soft breaking , while the scalar components denote supersymmetric couplings : the complex gauge coupling @xmath97 , the yukawa couplings @xmath98 , and the @xmath21 parameter .",
    "note that the factor @xmath99 in @xmath100 is introduced for a proper normalization of the gluino mass @xmath20 .",
    "obviously @xmath101 s are real superfields while @xmath100 and @xmath102 s are chiral .    after integrating out the gauge and matter superfields , the axion effective lagrangian can be read off from the effective lagrangian of the spurions by identifying the dimensionless axion superfield @xmath103 as the fluctuation of @xmath100 , i.e. by the identification yy+a .",
    "the effective lagrangian of spurions can be written as d^2d^2| k_eff(y , y^ * , z , z^ * , ) + d^2 w_eff(y , z)+h.c . , where the effective kahler potential @xmath104 is a real function of spurion superfields ( and also of their supercovariant derivatives ) while the effective superpotential @xmath105 is a holomorphic function of chiral spurions .    since the matter and gauge fields are integrated over a unique ground state preserving chiral symmetries , the above effective lagrangian does _ not _",
    "have any branch cut associated with the multiplicity of ground states .",
    "note that in the case with nonvanishing gaugino condensate @xmath106 , the corresponding effective lagrangian contains terms depending upon @xmath107 and thus has @xmath108 branches associated with the @xmath108 degenerate vacua which are related to each other by the @xmath109 shift of @xmath17 @xcite . in our case with a unique chiral invariant vaccum ,",
    "the effective lagrangian is a single valued function of @xmath110 , and thus is manifestly periodic under the @xmath109 shift of @xmath17 .",
    "instantons would induce a term in @xmath105 as e^-ny ( z ) , where @xmath111 is a positive integer corresponding to the instanton winding number .",
    "it is , however , easy to see that the selection rules of @xmath112 does not allow any holomorphic @xmath113 which is finite at @xmath114 .",
    "this implies that the axion potential does _ not _ appear through @xmath105 , _ but _ through @xmath104 .",
    "again the selection rules of @xmath112 implies that at the leading order the instanton - induced kahler potential takes the form ( for @xmath115 ) : k_effe^-y det(z_uz_d ) z_^*^3 f()+ h.c . , where @xmath116 is an arbitrary function of the real superfields @xmath101 .",
    "to obtain the axion potential from the superspace integration of @xmath104 , we need at least either a single insertion of @xmath117 or the simultaneous insertions of @xmath118 and @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath116 denote the auxiliary components of spurions . in other words ,",
    "supersymmetry ( together with the selection rules of @xmath112 ) implies that the axion potential is suppressed at least by the two powers of @xmath121 .",
    "note that here we consider instantons whose scale , i.e. the inverse of the instanton size @xmath122 , is in the range between @xmath24 ( or @xmath21 ) and the messenger scale @xmath123 above which soft breaking is _ not _ operative anymore . in the popular hidden sector models in which supersymmetry breaking is transmitted by supergravity interactions @xcite , the messenger scale @xmath124 , while it can be much lower in visible sector models @xcite .",
    "obviously instantons with @xmath125 ( if exist ) do not contribute to the axion potential due to the restored susy .",
    "as we will see , instantons which give dominant contributions have size @xmath126 and thus belong to the above category for @xmath127 .",
    "at any rate , from the k@xmath128hler potential of eq .",
    "( 17 ) , we readily find the susy suppression factor ^2=\\{m_i^2 , ab^ * , 16 ^ 2 m_1/2 b^ * } , where the factor @xmath99 in front of @xmath20 indicates that instanton graphs using @xmath20 to tie together gluino zero modes contain one less loop compared to those using other soft parameters .    with the above observation , one can write the axion potential in the case @xmath25 as v_a = e^ia / f_a ^*^3 det(_u_d ) + h.c .",
    "where @xmath129 is suppressed by @xmath130 ^ 2 $ ] and also by some powers of the loop factor @xmath131 .",

    "we already noted that the higgs masses are of order @xmath7 .",

    "although @xmath139 $ ] is roughly a constant since the beta function is small enough to approach to the fixed point @xcite , @xmath132 is suppressed by the large higgs masses .",
    "the above arguments imply that the dominant contribution is from instantons with size @xmath126 .",

    "we have computed the axion potential for the mssm with @xmath141 .",
    "in fact , the mssm can be considered as a rather special case since it contains a supersymmetric dimensionful parameter @xmath21 . to see what happens in models without such a parameter ,",

    "we examine whether the axion misalignment can be relaxed to a small value by a stronger qcd in the early universe . to proceed ,",
    "let us note that in generic supergravity models some low energy parameters other than @xmath7 are determined also by the vevs of some fields . in the early universe , such parameters may take values which differ from the present ones .",
    "however , in order for the early axion vev to coincide with the present vev , one should require that complex parameters which affect the axion vev have almost the same values as the present ones .",
    "for the mssm , ( _ eff)_mssm= _ qcd+arg(det(_u_d))+ 3arg(m_1/2)-3arg(b ) , while for the nssm we have ( _ eff)_nssm=_qcd+arg(det(_u_d ) ) + 3arg(m_1/2)-2arg(a)-arg(_1 ^ 3_2^ * ) .",

    "in which this susy breaking is transmitted by supergravity interactions , we have @xmath156 and @xmath157 , while the soft breaking in the supersymmteric standard model sector is radiatively generated as @xmath158 where @xmath111 is a model - dependent positive integer .",
    "this implies that @xmath154 is of order @xmath159 for visible sector models when the dilaton potential energy directly induced by the susy breaking dynamics is parameterized as eq .",

    "that the dilaton potential is _ not _ induced directly by the susy breaking dynamics , once susy is broken , it is generated in general by higher order loop effects .",

    "such loop effects are quadratic in both the mass splitting in supermultiplets and the messenger scale @xmath123 which corresponds to the cutoff scale , and thus can be written as eq . ( 27 ) .",

    "this implies that , due to radiative effects , @xmath154 _ can not _ be significantly smaller than @xmath160 in the hidden sector models . in visible sector models ,",
    "things are a bit more complicated .",
    "typical visible sector models include a so - called messenger sector which contains a vector - like quark and lepton superfields @xcite . by the aid of messegner @xmath161 gauge interaction , the susy breaking dynamics",
    "gives rise to a mass splitting @xmath162 in the messenger sector .",
    "subsequent radiative effects of the standard model gauge interactions then lead to the mass splitting @xmath163 in the supersymetric standard model sector .",
    "since @xmath162 is independent of the qcd coupling at leading order , loops of the messenger sector particles will induce a qcd coupling - dependent vacuum energy density again at two loop order .",
    "the corresponding dilaton potential energy is of order @xmath164 which is of order @xmath165 .",
    "thus in visible sector models , again due to radiative effects , @xmath154 _ can not _ be significantly smaller than order unity .    with the dilaton potential energy given in eq .",
    "( 27 ) in the early universe , the hubble expansion rate is given by hc^1/2 m_soft m_m m_pl^-1 , where @xmath166 gev .",
    "let us now examine whether the two conditions of eq .",
    "( 2 ) for the relaxation of the axion misalignment can be satisfied .",
    "we consider first the case that @xmath167 without any light quark .",
    "one can easily confirm that , as long as the complex parameters contributing to @xmath15 are unchanged , the axion vev determined by the early axion potential eq .",
    "( 4 ) , i.e. @xmath168 , coincides with @xmath15 . in the previous section ,",
    "we have noted that all quark masses would become larger than @xmath7 if both of the higgs soft masses @xmath35 and @xmath36 of eq .",
    "( 6 ) receives a significantly large _ negative _ contribution from the energy density in the early universe .",
    "this would make the higgs vevs slide down toward the flat direction @xmath169 .",
    "( note that a large positive contribution leads to vanishing higgs vevs .",
    ") however , as was noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , such a negative contribution arises usually through supergravity interactions of the form @xmath170 where @xmath171 is an inflaton - like field yielding an energy density of order @xmath172 . for",
    "the above operators significantly alter the higgs soft mass , one needs @xmath26 to be comparable to @xmath24 . obviously then",
    ", we obtain @xmath49 since @xmath173 in this case .",
    "let us consider the next case that @xmath7 is still less than @xmath24 but now there exists a light quark .",
    "the axion potential in this case is given by eq .",
    "( 5 ) . using this axion potential and eq . ( 28 ) , we then find 5 c^- 1/2 ( ) ( ) ( ) ^1/2 ( ) ^3/2()^1/2 , where all numbers in the brackets denote the energy scales in gev unit .",
    "the messenger scale @xmath123 can be as low as @xmath174 gev in the visible sector models for susy breaking .",
    "however , in other type of models including the popular hidden sector models , @xmath123 is typically much bigger than @xmath174 gev .",
    "as was mentioned , complex parameters contributing to @xmath15 in the early universe are required to have the values which are the same as the present one in order for the early axion vev ( @xmath168 ) to coincide with the present vev ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "real soft scalar masses @xmath175 escape from this requirement .",
    "they might be significantly bigger than the present values of order @xmath176 gev due to contributions from the radiation or other forms of energy density . note that if the early universe does not carry quantum numbers which are carried by some complex parameters , a nonzero energy density in such an early universe would enhance @xmath175 without affecting those complex parameters .",
    "however , if the enhanced soft mass - squared of higgs fields are significantly bigger than the unaffected @xmath177 gev , it makes the higgs vevs to vanish .",
    "this leads to @xmath178 and thus dramatically suppresses the axion potential .",
    "taking into account the points discussed above , it is easy to note that , for a given value of @xmath0 , the ratio @xmath179 becomes maximal for @xmath7 comparable to @xmath24 which is of order @xmath176 gev",
    ". then @xmath13 would be large enough to push the axion field toward the minimum if @xmath0 is in the range : @xmath180 gev .",
    "clearly in the hidden sector models with @xmath124 , this range of @xmath0 does not overlap with the interesting range @xmath181 gev .",
    "in visible sector models , the messenger scale @xmath123 corresponds to the scale of dynamical susy breaking and thus may be as low as @xmath174 gev .",
    "however as we have discussed , @xmath154 is at least of order unity in visible sector models and thus the axion mass is _ not _ large enough to relax the axion misalignment for @xmath181 gev .",
    "so far , we have argued that raising @xmath7 up to the order of @xmath24 or below ( while keeping the complex parameters that contribute to @xmath15 unchanged ) is not useful for relaxing the axion misalignment when @xmath181 gev .",
    "one might expect that raising @xmath7 further up to far above @xmath24 can leads to an axion mass @xmath182 .",
    "however , the axion potentials eq .",
    "( 21 ) and eq .",
    "( 24 ) computed in the previous section indicate that the axion mass is highly suppressed for @xmath25 .",
    "this is mainly because the higgs vevs and the condensates of the quarks , squarks , and the gluinos do _ not _ become of order @xmath7 , but they all _ vanish _ when @xmath25 . as a result ,",
    "instanton amplitudes for the axion potential are suppressed by the powers of small yukawa couplings and also of the small mass parameters @xmath21 and @xmath24 .",
    "before discussing the size of the axion mass , let us briefly discuss the axion vev . as can be noticed , the axion vev determined by the axion potentials eq .",
    "( 21 ) and eq .",
    "( 24 ) differ from the @xmath15 of eq .",
    "( 25 ) and eq .",
    "( 26 ) even when all complex parameters contributing @xmath15 in the early universe have the same values as the present one .",
    "in such a case , the misalignment angle @xmath183 for the mssm is given by ( ) _ mssm = n_1 arg(m_1/2a^*)+n_2 arg(m_1/2b^ * ) , where @xmath184 and @xmath185 are appropriate integers of order unity .",
    "similarly for the nssm , we have ( ) _ nssm = n arg(m_1/2a^ * ) for an integer @xmath108 of order unity . although can be nonzero , the above misalgnment angle is severely constrained by the neutron electric dipole moment @xcite as 10 ^ -2~10 ^ -3",
    "this would be small enough to raise the cosmological bound on @xmath0 up to the grand unification scale or the planck scale .",
    "however as we mentioned , the axion mass becomes too small to relax down the axion misalignment to a small value of order @xmath186 .    again using the axion potentials eq .",
    "( 21 ) and eq .",
    "( 24 ) , we find @xmath187 ( ) _ nssm10 ^ -5 c^-1/2 ( _ 1 ^ 3_2)^1/2 ( ) ( ) ( ) ^1/2 ( ) ^1/2 , where again the numbers in the brakets denote energy scales in gev unit .",
    "the above results obviously indicate that @xmath49 .",
    "although only two models are explicitly considered for the case @xmath25 , the huge suppression of the axion potential seems to be quite generic . in particular , adding more colored particles leads to a further suppression , and thus not helpful at all .",
    "we thus conclude that the axion misalignment _ can not _ be relaxed down to a small value even when @xmath25 . in summary",
    ", the analysis made in this section indicates that a stronger qcd in the early universe is not useful for relaxing the axion misalignment .",
    "in this paper , we have examined whether the axion misalignment can be relaxed down to a small value by a stronger qcd in the early universe .",
    "this would allow the axion scale to be of order the grand unification scale or the planck scale without any cosmological difficulty .",
    "we discussed in somewhat detail the axion potentials in the early universe , in particular for the case that @xmath25 .",
    "taking into account the dilaton potential energy associated with a stronger qcd , our analysis indicates that the two conditions @xmath182 and @xmath188 ( up to a small misalignment of order @xmath16 ) _ can not _ be satisfied simultaneously .",
