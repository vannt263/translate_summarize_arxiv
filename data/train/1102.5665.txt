    "the non - gaussian nature of asset returns has been established for many years from many perspectives . from the point of view of statistical moment studies ,",
    "fama @xcite and mandelbrot @xcite demonstrated the excess kurtosis of asset returns in the 1960s .",
    "studies published in 2003 @xcite focused on tail analysis , claiming that the tails of return distribution functions exhibit power - law behaviour , often with inverse _ cubic _ decay . maximum likelihood analysis has also been pursued .",
    "fergusson and platen @xcite exhibited the importance of student - t characteristics in _ daily log - returns _ of major indices . in the follow studies we will use the student t as a _ model _ of asset returns , in",
    "that it can simultaneously reproduce excess kurtosis , power - law tails and be at or close to the mle distributional estimate in a variety of situations .",
    "this is not to argue that this distribution is a universal panacea .",
    "rather , it serves three other purposes .",
    "first , its manifestly greater likelihood in matching observed returns suggest that it is useful model for exploring risk characteristics and asset allocation in its own right .",
    "second , it serves as a useful semi - analytical benchmark for more general computational models of optimization , to ensure their quality on an otherwise hard - to - obtain problem .",
    "var / cvar optimization has been pioneered by rockafeller and uryasev @xcite , and general risk measure optimization by shaw @xcite .",
    "finally , the reduction of var and cvar optimization to an essentially closed - form problem description , with an objective function that may be explicitly differentiated , opens the problem up to implementation on a wide variety of off - the - shelf optimizers .",
    "all of these studies and many others not cited here are attempting to bring greater diversity for choices of risk function to the pioneering work by markowitz and collaborators , e.g. @xcite , and to build in explicit management of a variety of asset return distributions by functions beyond those that may be expressed simply in terms of the first two moments .",
    "the purpose of this note is not to engage in the already vigorous debate about var and cvar as risk measures .",
    "there is a serious conceptual difficulty in estimating the probability of extreme events when there is so little data available .",
    "however , the view taken here is that several statistical studies over many decades based on the data that _ is _ available point to the student t as a sensible model , and one that is many orders of magnitude more likely than a gaussian model . in this sense",
    "the estimate of tail probabilities on such a basis is doing the _",
    "best one can given the data _ , and is certainly more scientific than clinging to a gaussian prescription and further indulging the pretence that unpredictable `` tsunami''-type events generate all the more extreme events .",
    "a @xmath0 event is roughly @xmath1 times more likely in a @xmath2 model ( as found in @xcite ) than it is in a gaussian .",
    "there certainly are isolated severe shocks but the routine is also highly non - normal and capable of extreme movements .",
    "let @xmath3 denote the pdf of the standard zero - mean and unit - variance normal distribution , and let @xmath4 denote the corresponding cdf with @xmath5 .",
    "the gaussian quantile function @xmath6 is the function satisfying the condition @xmath7 for all @xmath8 .",
    "this function is not available in simple closed - form , nor is its applied mathematics counterpart the inverse error function .",
    "however , its properties are well understood through the development of many numerical approximations @xcite and more recently through its characterization as the solution of the non - linear ode @xcite @xmath9 with boundary conditions @xmath10 .    in the case of a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath11 and variance @xmath12 ,",
    "the quantile function of that distribution is then @xmath13 and the corresponding `` value at risk '' , or var , is just the negative of the quantile , usually expressed in terms of a percentage number @xmath14 .",
    "that is @xmath15 in what follows we will work in terms of the @xmath16-parametrization , with the function @xmath17 so for example , the 2.5% var is given by @xmath18 and other choices of percentile lead to different weightings of the standard deviation .",
    "the cvar is a related entity , giving the _ average _ in a tail bounded by the corresponding var level . in general , for a density function @xmath19 linked to a random variable @xmath20 , we would need to work out @xmath21 = \\frac{1}{u } \\int_{-\\infty}^{q_g(u ) } x f(x ) dx\\ .\\ ] ] in the case @xmath22 , the integration may be done trivially , because @xmath23 , so that for a standard normal distribution @xmath21 = -\\frac{1}{u } \\phi(q_g(u))\\ ] ] and applying a scaling and translation to get the general case gives us , for the _ loss _ , @xmath24 in the case of a gaussian system , there is no substantive difference between the var and cvar measures : both take the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 in the case of var and @xmath27 in the case of @xmath28 .",
    "and the numerical values are very similar .",
    ".@xmath29-multipliers for gaussian var and cvar [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     but in the tails , for the values of @xmath30 suggested by both the power - law tails and mle estimation , there is serious danger of movements of more than @xmath31 , peaking at a @xmath32 average loss in events happening less than once every 40 years .      the generation of such quantiles in major modelling environments _ ought _ to be a matter of routine , but the excel program still continues to exhibit some awkwardness , even within excel 2011 .",
    "i itemized the problems with the older tinv function in a supplement to @xcite , still available at    http://www.mth.kcl.ac.uk/~shaww/web_page/papers/tsupp/tinv.pdf .    in more recent versions of excel",
    ", there is the better and new function t.inv which at least makes _ some _ direct computations of the quantiles in the left tail more clearly accessible .",
    "if you try , for example , t.inv(u,n ) and normalize to unit variance you will get answers corresponding to those in table above . however , non - integer degrees of freedom are just not managed .",
    "if you set @xmath33 you will get the results for @xmath34 . to be quite clear ,",
    "microsoft s online documenation for t.inv makes it clear that only integer degrees of freedom are managed .",
    "associated with the variable    .... deg_freedom ....    there is the following remark in the online documentation for excel 2011 mac edition : `` if this argument contains a decimal value , this function ignores the numbers to the right side of the decimal point . ''",
    "so far as i can determine , quantiles for strictly integer degrees of freedom are computed well and deep into the tail .",
    "this is of course sufficient within the use of the t as a small sample statistic , where the degrees of freedom is an integer , but does not go far enough for our purposes , where non - integer degrees of freedom are commonplace .",
    "the functions @xmath35 for @xmath36 and @xmath37 characterize the loss function for the standardized zero - mean unit - variance case of gaussian / t and var / cvar .",
    "it it is important to do the unit - variance normalization for the t as otherwise in making comparisons one is not working on a like - with - like basis .",
    "a comparison of the @xmath38-functions isolates the effect of the distributional choice on the loss .",
    "there may of course be additional effects due to a shift in the mean and an explosion in the variance , but we can now assess the effect on our perception of risk of changing the distribution alone to one that is much more realistic . at the same time we can parametrize the effect by the variable @xmath16 , which gives us the event frequency .    in figure 1",
    "we show a screen shot from a dynamic visualization of the var and cvar as a function of the power - law in the tails , modelled as a t distribution .",
    "the blue curves are gaussian , green a t with @xmath39 , and red a t with @xmath40 .",
    "there are two curves of each colour , with the upper curve being the cvar .",
    "the loss is given in multiples of the standard deviation , so the curves are our @xmath38-functions .",
    "the horizontal axis gives the logarithmic frequency .",
    "note that in the most extreme case we can get to @xmath41 events on sensible time - scales , whereas in a gaussian model even a @xmath42 event needs around 100 centuries .",
    "( red ) , @xmath2 ( green ) : cvar ( upper ) & var ( lower ) ]",
    "the var and cvar in any of these models is given by a risk function of the form @xmath43 all that has changed by the introduction of the student t model is the setting of a new scale for the @xmath29-weighting , which can now be dramatically higher when one worries about lower - frequency events .",
    "the values for some cases of interest can just be read off table 2 . by way of illustration , here are some sample problems :    * problem 1 * optimize gaussian var at at one in 40 day level : minimize @xmath44    * problem 2 * optimize gaussian cvar at one in 40 year level : minimize @xmath45 note how in problems 1 and 2 the simultaneous switch to cvar and switching days to years has only doubled the @xmath29-weighting . on the other hand ...    * problem 3 * optimize student t cvar at one in 40 year level , with a cubic tail model : minimize @xmath46 so it is intuitively clear that these problems are intuitively driving us to increase the risk - aversion . once we have the var and cvar optimizations in this form , they may be fed to a wide variety of simple optimizers to find the optimal weights .",
    "it is self - evident that the impact of the remodelling of the input distribution is to drive the risk - optimal solution closer to one of pure minimum variance as @xmath38 becomes larger , but all the points are on the same efficient frontier .",
    "this may easily be illustrated using any simple optimizer . with values of @xmath16 in the form @xmath47 , with @xmath48 in the range",
    "@xmath49 $ ] in steps of a half , a simple 3d test problem was optimized first under gaussian var and then under student t cvar with @xmath34 .",
    "the optima are shown in the figure in blue for gaussian var and red for t cvar , and an obvious pattern is obtained with return ( vertical ) plotted against variance ( horizontal ) .",
    "the covariance matrix and expected returns are the same in both cases .",
    "a _ mathematica _",
    "notebook with the calculation details is available on request , but figure 2 tells the obvious story .",
    "these results have also been compared with the random portfolio optimization method described in @xcite and good agreement has been found with a sample of portfolio returns of size @xmath50 for larger @xmath16 - values .",
    "in this paper we have given analytical formulae for the var and cvar of a system where the returns are characterized by a student t distribution .",
    "the risks of a given loss measured in standard deviations are massively bigger than in the gaussian case and may be computed simply . a switch from var",
    "to cvar is in practice vacuous if the system remains gaussian , but may make a large difference with power - law tails in the returns .",
    "the problem of optimizing var and cvar is reduced to a trivial moment - based optimization and the outcome is to make a simple enhancement of the weighting of the variance component .",
    "optima in a fat - tailed world are explicitly driven towards the pure minimum variance configuration .",
    "none of these results should be used to infer that better investigation of tail statistics need not be done . here",
    "maximum - likelihood estimates of historical distributions are being extrapolated into statements about tails , and all the usual caveats apply .",
    "we might ask whether this kind of analysis can be done fore more general distributions ? for systems with finite variance , we can always apply a scaling and translation of the quantile function such that , for the var of a portfolio , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a function of other parameters @xmath53 beyond the mean and variance , and satisfies @xmath54 the problem in general is that @xmath53 will themselves be functions of the weights . in the case of the student t in standard multivariate form we have homogenity of the system in that the same value of",
    "the single extra parameter @xmath30 applies to all the assets and to any portfolio built from them by linear combination .",
    "this is what allows us to work with such a system using simple analytics .",
    "similar constructions could be done with any conditionally gaussian form with a homogeneous randomization of the variance .",
    "the determination of @xmath30 is something that is probably best done , at least initially , by maximum likelihood estimation .",
    "the temptation to use a simple kurtosis model should be resisted .",
    "this is for the simple reason that the total kurtosis is given by @xmath55 and is undefined for @xmath56 , which is a domain of considerable interest given the data studies .",
    "finally we note that is likely that other risk functions will admit a similar decomposition to simple mean - s.d .",
