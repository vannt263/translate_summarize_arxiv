    "the idea that massive galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) may be formed within dwarf galaxies is not new ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , theoretical considerations and new observations demonstrated that massive gcs like @xmath1 cen or m  54 probably had their origin in dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) , which are currently either lost or still surrounding the cluster ( @xcite ) .",
    "this idea was extended by @xcite to practically @xmath2 gcs , sketching a scenario which unifies the view of gcs and dsphs .",
    "the ancestral progenitors of both kinds of systems started as cosmological fragments , but the evolution of dsphs proceeded undisturbed in near isolation from the distant main galaxy . on the contrary , strong interaction with the galactic main body triggered a chain of events in the so called @xmath3 of current gcs , whose final products are the systems we are seeing ( see @xcite for a detailed description ) .",
    "the same mechanism may also work within a single dsph , as in the case of fornax or sagittarius .",
    "this scenario , although not entirely new ( e.g. , @xcite ) , may explain several characteristics of gcs , including the multiple stellar generations , found in @xmath2 objects investigated so far ( @xcite and @xcite for a review ) .",
    "it is currently well assessed that the second - generation stars ( presently constituting the bulk of the cluster population ) should have formed from the ejecta of only a fraction of the first - generation ( primordial ) stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to account for the present chemical composition , a precursor baryonic mass about 20 - 50 times larger than the current mass of the gcs",
    "is required @xcite . however , the proposed scenario is still qualitative ; for instance , it is not obvious that only @xmath4 gc should be the final output of an individual precursor .",
    "examples of binary and multiple clusters are frequently observed in the large magellanic cloud ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "to clarify these issues , we added ngc  1851 to our ongoing flames survey studying the na - o anticorrelation in gcs @xcite .",
    "ngc  1851 has a bimodal horizontal branch ( hb ) and several other peculiarities .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) shows a double subgiant branch ( sgb ; @xcite ) .",
    "two distinct red giant branch ( rgb ) sequences were discovered by @xcite with ca@xmath5 photometry , and confirmed by @xcite using broad - band filters . in @xcite",
    "we challenged the hypothesis advanced by @xcite of ca variations in gcs , ascribed to a possible pollution by core - collapse sn  ii .",
    "however , the case of ngc  1851 was left open , since we had not yet adequate data .",
    "a photometric approach alone is probably not enough to understand the complex nature of multiple populations in gcs .",
    "the most striking photometric feature in ngc  1851 , the split sgb , has been explained in terms either of an age / metallicity / helium effect or a different total cno content between the two populations ( e.g. , @xcite ) . a mix of two or more factors can not be excluded . furthermore , the spatial distribution of these sub - populations is still controversial ( @xcite ) .",
    "only a precise chemical tagging allows the accurate separation of different stellar generations , and helps providing a first relative ranking in age between them .",
    "the only existing abundance analysis from high resolution spectroscopy in this gc is the one by @xcite , on eight rgb stars .",
    "that analysis ( complemented by @xcite ) showed a number of additional interesting features : a possible small metallicity spread , correlations between abundances of p - capture elements and elements produced in @xmath6processes , and possibly a variable value of the total c+n+o sum .",
    "however , these data are only available for a frustrating small number of stars .    in this letter",
    "we partially fill this gap , presenting the results on the chemical composition of more than 120 red giants .",
    "we think that our results support the hypothesis that ngc  1851 formed starting from two clusters ( likely born within a single dsph ) , an idea already circulating in the literature for gcs with composite cmds , in particular for ngc  1851 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these two clusters have slightly different metallicity , and later underwent a merger , leaving however detectable traces of that past event .",
    "the flames spectra ( giraffe and uves ) of 124 rgb members of ngc  1851 were obtained in april , august , and september 2009 .",
    "the stellar parameters were determined using the same techniques described , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "a full description of the analysis will be presented elsewhere ( carretta et al . , in preparation ) ; here we only show abundances of some interesting species : fe , na , o , ca , a few @xmath6process elements , such as ba , la , ce , and the @xmath7process element eu . details of our abundance analysis trace as closely as possible the homogeneous procedures adopted for other gcs ( @xcite and references therein ) ( from @xmath8 and the @xcite calibration ) and @xmath9 magnitudes , much more reliably measured than colors , leading to very small internal errors in the atmospheric parameters , hence in the derived abundances . ]",
    "our first result _ is that there is a small but real spread in metallicity _ in ngc  1851 .",
    "we find an average [ fe / h]i @xmath10 ( @xmath11 dex ) from 13 stars with uves spectra .",
    "the analysis of the giraffe spectra yields [ fe / h]i @xmath12 ( @xmath13 dex , 121 stars ) , after correcting the equivalent widths to the system defined by the higher resolution uves spectra ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observed dispersions in [ fe / h]i for uves spectra are statistically significant when compared to internal errors in [ fe / h ] , which are estimated to be 0.017 dex ( internal errors for giraffe spectra , 0.060 dex , are too large to be used in this context )  relation between t@xmath14 and the @xmath9 magnitude along the rgb , which tends to decrease real abundance spreads .",
    "finally , the reddening is very low ( @xmath15=0.02 , * ? ? ? * ) and not differential . ] .",
    "there are additional ways to show that the spread in [ fe / h ] is real .",
    "first , @xcite also found some range in [ fe / h ] , although they did not expand on this due to the small size of their sample .",
    "second , in fig .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] we compare the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) in ngc  1851 with the mdfs of m  4 and m  5 , gcs of similar metallicity analyzed through an identical procedure ( @xcite ) .",
    "the metallicity spread in ngc  1851 is clearly larger .",
    "the mdf of m  4 would reproduce the one of ngc  1851 if we split it into two equal components with a difference in metallicity of 0.06 - 0.08 dex ; the same is obtained for m  5 .",
    "finally , we also find a spread in [ ca / h ] , similar to the one in [ fe / h ] , confirming photometric results by @xcite and @xcite .    for the sake of the following discussion",
    "we arbitrarily assume that ngc  1851 is made of a metal - poor ( mp ) and a metal - rich ( mr ) component . since there is no obvious gap between these components",
    ", we simply assume that stars with [ fe / h ] larger than the average -1.16 dex belong to the mr component , the others to the mp one .",
    "[ f : fig2 ] shows the rgb accordingly divided .",
    "if we fit the rgb with a line and compute the residuals in color between the individual stars and the line , the mr stars have average @xmath16 color redder by 0.02@xmath170.008 mag than the mp ones , in very good agreement with what is expected ( @xcite ) from the difference in metallicity .",
    "one of our most striking results is shown in the right panel of fig.1 : _ these two metallicity components have a clearly different spatial distribution _ , with the mp one being more concentrated than the mr component .",
    "all our stars are in the external regions , at more than 2 half - mass radii ( fig .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] ) , where the relaxation time is very long so that mass segregation between the two components can not be responsible , since the mass difference implied by the different metallicity and age ( see sect .",
    "6 ) is about 0.04 m@xmath18 .",
    "our new result , statistically very robust , is fully independent from any claimed radial distribution of sgb stars .",
    "we find the familiar na - o anticorrelation also in ngc  1851 .",
    "interestingly , this signature remains visible even considering the mr and mp populations separately . in fig .",
    "[ f : fig3 ] we show the na - o anticorrelation for both components , together with the run of the [ o / na ] ratios as a function of the metallicity .",
    "we use [ na / h ] and [ o / h ] to account for the well known metallicity - dependence of na as a function of the metal - abundance for stars of the primordial ( p ) component ( see the definition of primordial , intermediate i , and extreme e populations in @xcite ) .",
    "the na - o anticorrelation is slightly different for the mr and mp components , but in both cases the extension is quite modest , more similar to that in m  4 than in ngc  2808 .",
    "this suggests only a modest spread in he in ngc  1851 because a high y fraction seems to be associated only to very long tails of very o - poor stars , not present in this gc .",
    "our finding from a chemical approach confirms the claims by @xcite , based on the absence of a tilt along the hb and the lack of a splitting in the ms .",
    "in addition , we observe a slight change of the mean value of o and na abundances at the level of the bump on the rgb .",
    "we already showed @xcite that this variation is expected from theoretical models , which predict a change in the bump luminosity with he content @xcite , i.e. with elements involved in p - capture reactions .",
    "the presence of a mix of first and second generation stars results in a concentration of na - poor / he - poor stars just before the bump accompanied by an accumulation of na - rich / he - rich stars just above the bump level .",
    "this accounts for the observed abundance changes at the bump without resurrecting the internal mixing scenario for o and na ( e.g. @xcite ) and then overcoming the unpalatable requirement of basic stellar structure differences between field and gc stars .",
    "for ngc  1851 , where we hypothesize two distinct clusters ( see below ) , we expect a further smearing of the bump in the rgb luminosity function ( carretta et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "in fig .  [ f : fig4 ] , we use the strmgren @xmath19 cmd to test where stars of different components and populations are located on the rgb . this plane is optimally suited to separate first and second generation stars , probably because of n ( enhanced in o - depleted , second generation stars ) via the formation of nh , cn and their relevance on the @xmath20 ( or the johnson @xmath21 ) , see @xcite .",
    "stars of the first generation ( p , @xcite ) in ngc  1851 lie along a narrow strip to the blue of the rgb ( fig .",
    "[ f : fig4 ] , bottom panel ) , as expected from their unprocessed chemical abundances . on the contrary ,",
    "the second generation stars are spread out to the red , as in ngc  6752 ( @xcite ) : the i stars are in the middle and the extreme e component , with the lowest o abundances , is located at the reddest edge .",
    "this segregation is followed also within each metallicity component , and it is  orthogonal \" to the separation of mr and mp stars ( fig .  [",
    "f : fig4 ] , top panel ) , which are well intermingled across all the rgb in this color .",
    "the same holds if we separate the rgb stars using the average value for ca ( [ ca / h]@xmath22 ) : stars with low and high ca are spread across the entire rgb ( fig .",
    "[ f : fig4 ] , middle panel ) .",
    "therefore the spread of ca does not track the abundances of p - capture elements . a k - s test on the cumulative distributions of [ ca / h ] for stars of the first and second generations in ngc  1851 indicates that they are indistinguishable .",
    "instead , the ca abundances closely track those of fe",
    ". the cumulative distribution of [ ca / h ] values for the mr and mp components on the rgb are definitively different . moreover ,",
    "also the radial distributions of ca - rich and ca - poor stars confirm the close correspondence with metallicity : the ca - poor giants are more concentrated , while ca - rich stars show a tendency toward more external regions .",
    "is there a comprehensive scenario able to account for all the evidence found here and in previous works in ngc  1851 ?",
    "in our view , the answer is affirmative if we consider ngc  1851 as the result of a chain of events that started with two distinct clusters .",
    "several suggestions of duplicity come from the bimodal distribution of hb stars , the double sgb , and hints of double sequences on the rgb . up to now",
    ", the main objection was the absence of a metallicity spread , owing to the lack of precise abundances for a statistically significant number of stars .",
    "this limitation has finally been overcome by our study .    as a tentative working hypothesis we can think of two different clusters , born in a much larger system , perhaps a dsph .",
    "being distinct , each one might have formed with a slightly different metallicity and with a different level of @xmath0elements .",
    "each object is rightfully a gc , since each component show the na - o anticorrelation , the classical signature of the processes ending in a gc ( @xcite ) . after a while",
    ", the two clusters underwent a merger , likely because both were dragged to the center of the dsph by dynamical friction ( see @xcite ) and the result is ngc  1851 .",
    "finally , the dsph merged with the milky way .",
    "we think that this is the simplest scenario , that with a minimum of hypothesis may account for many observational constraints .",
    "the two mr and mp components do not show any significant difference in kinematics , the velocity dispersion being the same for both components",
    ". a comprehensive dynamical model would be very welcome , although we do not know when the merging occurred .",
    "we will rely on the observed chemistry .",
    "the observables include : a double sgb , where the faint sgb ( fsgb ) includes 45% of the stars and the bright sgb ( bsgb ) the remaining 55% ( @xcite ) , and with controversial evidence of different concentration ; the mr and mp components on the rgb , with a clear difference in radial concentration ; a bimodal distribution on the hb , with @xmath23 of the stars on the bhb and @xmath24 on the rhb ( @xcite ) ; the observed luminosity of hb stars and the moderate extension of the na - o anticorrelation in both the mr and mp rgb components , which both suggests small he abundance variations .",
    "\\(i ) a single gc with two populations having a different total cno abundance ( but a similar he abundance ) .",
    "this may explain the sgb but fails to reproduce the number ratios on the hb ( if the same efficiency for mass loss on the rgb is assumed for both sub - populations ) , because the minor fsgb component should be associated with the major rhb one .",
    "\\(ii ) a single gc with two populations having a different he and total cno abundance . in this scenario",
    "there is much more he in cno - rich than in cno normal stars .",
    "the cno effect dominates on the sgb , and he effect on the hb .",
    "however , in this scenario the bhb should also be brighter than the rhb , which is not observed ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "\\(iii ) a merging of two gcs differing in age ( although this does not exclude _ a priori _ a difference in the total cno ) . in this scenario , one of the gc ( including some 55 - 60% of the stars ) would be responsible for the bright , younger ( possibly less concentrated ) sgb , of the mr ( less concentrated ) rgb , and of the younger rhb",
    ". the other gc ( including some 40 - 45% of the stars ) would be responsible of the faint , older ( possibly more concentrated ) sgb , of the mp ( more concentrated ) rgb , and of the older bhb . in this case",
    ", the two sgbs can be fitted by isochrones differing in age by @xmath25 gyr , if the same cno content is assumed for both gcs , and the difference in fe is as derived from the mp and mr rgb components .",
    "should the solution ( iii ) be the right one , the age difference that we need ( @xmath26  gyr ) is not unlikely if the clusters were born in a dsph ( see e.g. , the case of the fornax dsph gcs , @xcite ) . as a consistency check , we explored lee s diagram hb - type vs [ fe / h ] ( see e.g. , fig . 9 in @xcite)using the average values of metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath27 ( @xmath28 dex ) and [ fe / h]@xmath29 ( @xmath28 dex ) for the mp and mp components , respectively .",
    "if we tentatively adopt for the two components the hb type of ngc  288 ( 0.98 ) and ngc  362 ( -0.87 ) , the diagram shows that the mr component may easily be about 1 - 1.5 gyr younger then the mp one .",
    "an additional constraint comes from the ratio between the abundances of @xmath6 and @xmath7process elements .",
    "[ f : fig5 ] shows the [ ba / eu ] ratio as a function of metallicity for the 13 stars with uves spectra .",
    "this ratio is close to that expected from a pure-@xmath30 component for mp stars , while it indicates a larger contribution by @xmath31 process for the mr ones .",
    "the trend with [ fe / h ] is even cleaner when using the average from ba , la , and ce .",
    "it suggests a larger contribution of polluters of smaller masses for the mr component , which fits well with the proposed age difference .    to conclude",
    ", we note that @xcite reported the existence of a distinct metal - poor main sequence around the gcs ngc  1851 and ngc  1904 , which they interpreted as a very low surface brightness stellar system .",
    "this is maybe consistent with the structure identified by @xcite in the form of a halo of main - sequence stars surrounding ngc  1851 up to a distance of 250 pc .",
    "both these observations suggest the existence of a residual structure that might be what is left by the destruction of the ancestral dwarf where the progenitor of ngc  1851 originated .",
    "a really clear - cut test for the presence of two distinct gcs is to probe the na - o anticorrelation among hb stars .",
    "if the merger hypothesis is correct , each one of the hb populations ( coming from individual gcs ) should present the na - o anticorrelation , as we find in the mr and mp components of the rgb . on the contrary , for a single proto - cluster scenario",
    ", we should expect the rhb stars be almost all o - rich , with the o - poor stars only confined to the bhb .",
    "specific proposals of observations aimed to perform this test have been already submitted .                                                                                             value .",
