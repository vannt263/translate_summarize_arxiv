    "systems in the vicinity of a critical point show scale invariance  @xcite .",
    "quantities like the susceptibility obey a homogeneity property , which is characterized by critical exponents and scaling functions . within the framewrk of renormalization group theory",
    "it can be shown that this scaling property is closely related to the existence of a fixed point of the renormalization group transformation . in the simplest case the critical behavior of a particular problem",
    "is dominated by just one fixed point .",
    "quite frequently , however , one encounters physical systems which can exhibit different scaling behavior in different asymptotic regimes . in those cases it becomes important to study the crossover from one type of critical behavior to another .",
    "examples for such crossover problems are bicritical and tricritical points ( in general multicritical points ) , magnetic systems with anisotropic interactions such as anisotropies in the exchange interaction as well as dipolar interaction , finite size problems , and in general any problem which is characterized by some length scales in addition to the correlation length @xmath0 .",
    "the theoretical investigations of those crossover phenomena started with a scaling theory by riedel and wegner  @xcite , and the extended scaling hypothesis of pfeuty , fisher and jasnow  @xcite .",
    "nelson has presented the first renormalization - group formalism for calculating the crossover scaling functions associated with such situations , the so called trajectory integral method  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will present a field theoretic version of nelson s trajectory integral method and exemplify the method by several problems from various fields of critical phenomena .",
    "the method is based on the work by amit and goldschmidt  @xcite who proposed a `` generalized minimal subtraction method '' , which has subsequently been applied to various crossover problems  @xcite .",
    "recently the method has been extended to deal with situations , where the crossover is accompanied by a change in the upper critical dimension  @xcite .    in many crossover problems",
    "one encounters a situation where besides the correlation length @xmath0 there is a second length scale , characterized by the anisotropy scale @xmath1 . out of many examples we would like to discuss three quite characteristic cases .",

    "all these phenomena have in common the characteristic that the anisotropy scale appears in the harmonic part of the effective functional of the model , and that asymptotically there is a change in the upper critical dimension ( usually a reduction ) .",
    "hence there are not only different critical points complicating the renormalization group analysis , but in addition those fixed points are characterized by different upper critical dimensions .",
    "the latter invalidates conventional methods such as @xmath9-expansion since there is no fixed upper critical dimension to expand around . on the contrary",
    "the crossover may be even viewed as a continuous variation of the upper critical dimension .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section we introduce an extended minimal subtraction procedure which is capable of describing crossover phenomena from one fixed point to another accompanied by a change in the upper critical dimension . in section 3",
    "we exemplify the method for the three models mentioned above .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section 4 and give an outlook concerning the broad applicability of the method .",
    "crossover phenomena are characterized by the presence of at least one additional relevant length scale @xmath1 besides the correlation length @xmath10 .",
    "frequently it is given by an anisotropy or `` mass '' parameter describing the variation from one scaling region to another , or in renormalization group language , from a primary fixed point to a secondary fixed point .",
    "we have listed some examples in the introduction . in order to describe this crossover from one critical behavior to another riedel and wegner  @xcite",
    "have formulated a scaling theory , and later pfeuty , fisher and jasnow  @xcite proposed an extended scaling hypothesis for crossover systems .",
    "let @xmath11 be the reduced temperature and @xmath1 be the scaling field characterizing the additional length scale in the problem , then the crossover scaling ansatz , e.g. for the susceptibility , reads @xmath12 near the multicritical point @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 is the susceptibility exponent _ at _ the primary fixed point , while @xmath8 is the crossover exponent . in order to describe the change of the critical indices induced by the crossover from the primary to the secondary fixed point",
    ", one assumes that the crossover scaling function @xmath15 becomes singular at @xmath16 @xmath17 as @xmath18 approaches criticality for fixed @xmath1 .",
    "as is obvious from the above description of the phenomenological crossover scaling theory , it has the disadvantage that the crossover in the critical indices is incorporated in the crossover scaling function in a rather singular way",
    ". it would be much more convenient to have a formulation of the crossover problem , where the crossover of the exponents is incorporated in the power law prefactor @xmath19 by @xmath14 becoming an effective exponent depending on the crossover scaling variable @xmath20 .",
    "this would leave us with a regular scaling function @xmath21 .",
    "as will become clear later the field theoretic method proposed in this section , will satisfy the latter requirement .    the first quantitative theory for crossover scaling functions based on the renormalization group theory",
    "was given by nelson  @xcite .",
    "he introduced a formalism which expresses the free energy as a trajectory integral along the renormalization group flow lines .",
    "the method proposed below will be similar in spirit to this trajectory integral method , but will have considerable technical advantages due to the explicit separation of singular and regular terms in the crossover scaling function .",
    "now we describe a field theoretic method for the analysis of crossover phenomena .",
    "the technical difficulty one encounters here is that both the ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) singularities will differ in the two distinct scaling regimes",
    ". early work on formulating crossover phenomena in terms of field theoretic methods , tried to parallel the formulation using phenomenological scaling theories . in this `` traditional '' approach to crossover problems",
    ", one would compute the critical exponents at one of the stable fixed points ; all the crossover features would then be contained in the accompanying scaling function as corrections to this scaling behavior .",
    "however , in general a calculation to high order in the perturbation expansion would be required in order to achieve a satisfactory description of the entire crossover region . of course , using an ( @xmath22 ) expansion with respect to either of the fixed points renders the other one completely inaccessible , if their upper critical dimensions do not coincide .",
    "therefore amit and goldschmidt s idea  @xcite to incorporate the crossover features already in the exponent functions has proven much more successful than treating the problem on the basis of scaling functions .",
    "the essential prescription one has to bear in mind is that the renormalization constants are not solely functions of the anharmonic coupling , but necessarily also of the additional `` mass '' or anisotropy parameter @xmath23 describing the interplay between the two different scaling regimes  @xcite . for a consistent treatment of the entire crossover region , one",
    "thus has to assure that the uv singularities are absorbed into the z factors for any arbitrary value of @xmath23 , including @xmath24 .",
    "this is not a trivial prescription , as usual the @xmath25 poles will be altered in the different scaling regimes .",
    "for the situation that we have in mind , even the value of the upper critical dimension is bound to change as the crossover takes place , in contrast to previously studied cases @xcite .",
    "however , we shall demonstrate that with the above stated so - called `` generalized subtraction scheme '' this change in the upper critical dimension may be incorporated into the usual formalism without any drastic changes , provided one refrains from any @xmath9 expansion about @xmath26 .",
    "the perturbation series is then an expansion with respect to the effective coupling @xmath27 to be introduced later , which is not an a - priori small parameter , and the perturbation expansion is uncontrolled in this sense .",
    "if higher orders of the perturbation expansion were known , one could substantially refine the theory by a borel resummation procedure .",
    "for a more detailed discussion of the question in which cases one may dispense with a @xmath28 expansion , we refer to work of schloms and dohm @xcite .",
    "we remark that the somewhat misleading term `` generalized minimal subtraction scheme '' stems from the fact that in the framework of an @xmath9 expansion this corresponds to adding logarithms of @xmath23 , which are finite in the limit @xmath29 , to the @xmath30 factors .",
    "this is the procedure proposed in the original work by amit and goldschmidt  @xcite .",
    "but it works only if the upper critical dimension of the primary and secondary fixed point are equal .",
    "otherwise the method by amit and goldschmidt has to be extended .",
    "there are several ways to implement the requirement that the vertex functions become finite in both limits @xmath31 and @xmath24 after reparameterizing the theory using renormalization factors .",
    "we will explicitly use two of them .",
    "firstly , for the uniaxial dipolar ferromagnet , discussed in section 3.1 , we will use the prescription of amit and goldschmidt , extended in the following way . upon performing an @xmath9-expansion around the upper critical dimension of the primary fixed point ,",
    "one gets to one loop order renormalization factors of the structure @xmath32 .",
    "we reexponentiate those logarithms of @xmath1 such as to map the result one would obtain by doing an expansion of the model for @xmath24 around the upper critical dimension of the secondary fixed point .",
    "this prescription allows for an analytic treatment of the flow equations .",
    "secondly , we will determine the renormalization factors by requiring that it contains all the singularities for both limits @xmath33 and @xmath34 , but without performing any expansion around any of the critical dimensions .",
    "a ( minor ) price to be paid is that for the flow equations and related quantities only numerical solutions are accessible , and merely the limiting cases of @xmath35 and @xmath24 , respectively , allow for an analytical investigation .",
    "the latter method is quite close to the method of normalization conditions  @xcite , but is minimal in that it contains just the poles in @xmath36 for both limits @xmath35 and @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath9 refers to the distance to the upper critical dimension of the primary and secondary fixed point , respectively .",
    "although the following discussion of the flow equations can be presented more generally , it is convenient to have the specific set of effective free energy functionals and actions in mind , which we have presented in the introduction .",
    "therefore , we assume that all of wilson s flow functions characterizing the crossover in the fixed points and the corresponding critical exponents depend only on two parameters , @xmath37 .",
    "the renormalization group equations relate the values of an arbitrary vertex function at one point in parameter space to a transformed point . conceptually the renormalization group equations are obtained by observing that all bare vertex functions @xmath38",
    "are independent of the arbitrary renormalization scale @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a set of parameters characterizing the effective free energy functional under consideration , and @xmath42 indicates that all derivatives have to be taken at fixed values of the bare parameters .",
    "the quantity @xmath1 is the second length scale of the problem besides the correlation length @xmath0 , and @xmath43 is the coupling constant of the nonlinearity .",
    "wilson s flow functions are defined by @xmath44 where @xmath45 stands for the parameters @xmath41 , the anisotropy scale @xmath1 and the coupling constant @xmath43 .",
    "furthermore we introduce the @xmath46-function for the renormalization of the vertex function @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "then one derives the following partial differential equation @xmath50                                 \\gamma ( \\mu,{\\bf a},g , u;{\\bf q } ) = 0   \\label{9}\\ ] ] for the renormalized vertex function . as a consequence of the generalized renormalization scheme , all the flow functions are functions of the coupling constant @xmath43 as well as the anisotropy scale @xmath1",
    "this leads to renormalization group trajectories in a two - dimensional parameter space , the @xmath51-plane . within this plane",
    "there are usually several fixed points , where two of them are of particular importance .",
    "these are the primary fixed point @xmath52 located at @xmath53 and the secondary fixed point @xmath54 located at @xmath55 .",
    "the primary fixed point turns out to be infrared stable for @xmath53 only , whereas all the renormalization group flow tends to the secondary fixed point @xmath54 if the anisotropy scale @xmath1 is nonzero .",
    "the renormalization group flow within wilson s elimination procedure is generated by the introduction of a spatial rescaling factor @xmath56 . in the present field",
    "theoretic framework , a renormalization group trajectory is given in terms of the characteristics of the callan - symanzik equation , eq.([9 ] ) .",
    "the characteristics are defined as the solution of the following first order differential equations @xmath57 with the initial conditions @xmath58 , namely @xmath59 .",
    "if we denote the engineering dimension of the vertex function @xmath47 by @xmath60 and define the dimensionless ( renormalized ) vertex function @xmath61 by @xmath62 the solution of eq.([9 ] ) reads @xmath63 here we have introduced an effective anharmonic coupling @xmath27 , which is some combination of the nonlinearity @xmath43 and the anisotropy scale @xmath1 , where the detailed form depends on the particular problem one is considering .",
    "the introduction of this effective coupling constant is necessitated by the fact that one should work with coupling constants whose fixed point values are finite in both limits , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the representation ( [ 13 ] ) of the vertex function in terms of the characteristics of the parameters and coupling constants constitutes an explicit expression for the desired crossover scaling function .",
    "compared to the trajectory integral method of nelson  @xcite the above formalism has the advantage that the singular and the regular part of the crossover scaling functions are explicitly separated .",
    "this is simply a consequence of the field theoretic renormalization procedure .      in this subsection",
    "we give a qualitative discussion of the renormalization group flow in the @xmath66-plane , where @xmath67 and @xmath27 are appropriately defined effective coupling constants , which are finite in the isotropic ( @xmath53 ) and anisotropic ( @xmath55 ) limit .",
    "usually the topology of the flow diagram is determined by the presence of four fixed points , the primary and the secondary fixed points , and two gaussian fixed points with @xmath68 at @xmath53 and @xmath55 .",
    "the primary fixed point is infrared stable only if the anisotropy parameter equals zero .",
    "otherwise the only infrared stable fixed point is the secondary fixed point .",
    "all other fixed points are unstable .",
    "the flow diagram is separated into two regions by a separatrix , which is given by the trajectory originating from the primary fixed point and terminating in the secondary fixed point .",
    "this renormalization group trajectory describes the universal crossover from primary to secondary critical behavior .",
    "the flow diagram can be investigated quantitatively upon solving the flow equation of the running coupling @xmath69 @xmath70 where the @xmath71 function is defined by @xmath72 . in the flow equations above",
    ", the parameter @xmath73 may be considered as describing the effect of a scaling transformation upon the system . roughly speaking @xmath74 corresponds to the wilson rescaling factor @xmath56 .",
    "obviously , the theory becomes scale - invariant when a fixed - point @xmath75 , to be obtained as a zero of the @xmath71 function , @xmath76 , is approached .",
    "the properties of the vertex function in the vicinity of the fixed point will yield the correct asymptotic behavior , if the latter is infrared - stable . upon defining the fixed point values of the flow functions by @xmath77 , also called the anomalous dimensions of the parameters @xmath78 , we find @xmath79 using the matching condition @xmath80 , one arrives at the following scaling form @xmath81 where we have specialized to the simple case that the set of parameters @xmath82 reduces to just one parameter , namely the reduced temperature @xmath11 .",
    "we defined two independent critical exponents according to @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the crossover exponent @xmath8 can be read off from the homogeneity relation for the vertex function upon using the matching condition @xmath85 @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "note that all of the above exponents correspond to the exponents at the secondary , and asymptotically stable , fixed point . if one could neglect the variation of the scaling functions on the flow of the parameters on the right hand side of eq.([13 ] ) , the effective exponents of the problems would simply be given by equations like @xmath83 , where the fixed point values of the wilson flow functions are replaced by their values along the renormalization group trajectory .",

    "it has the advantage of being capable of describing quite complicated crossover scenarios .",
