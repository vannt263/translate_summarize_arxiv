    "understanding time evolution of an open quantum system of many interacting particles is of primary importance in fundamental problems of quantum physics , such as decoherence @xcite and closely related quantum measurement problem @xcite , quantum computation @xcite , or the problem of computation of _ non - equilibrium steady states _ ( ness ) in quantum statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "even though application of the methods of hamiltonian dynamical systems and ergodic theory to quantum systems out of equilibrium gives many promising results @xcite , the field of open quantum systems is still lacking non - trivial explicitly solvable models , as compared to studies of closed ( isolated ) quantum systems where we know a large body of the so - called _ completely integrable _ systems @xcite .",
    "examples of explicitly solvable models of master equations for open quantum systems are limited to quite restricted models of a single particle , single spin or harmonic oscillators ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we show that the generator of the master equation of a general quadratic system of @xmath0 interacting fermions which are coupled to a general set of markovian baths , specified in terms of lindblad operators which are linear in the fermionic variables - the so called quantum liouville super - operator ( or liouvillean ) - can be explicitly diagonalized in terms of @xmath4 _ normal master modes _ , i.e. anticommuting super - operators which act on the fock space of density operators .",
    "this can be understood as a complex ( non - canonical ) version of the bogoliubov transformation @xcite lifted on the operator space , and has very powerful consequences : ( i ) the ness of the master equation can be understood as the ` ground state ' normal mode of the liouvillean , whereas the long time relaxation rate is given by the eigenmode closest to the real axis .",
    "( ii ) the covariance matrix of ness can be computed explicitly in terms of the eigenvectors of @xmath5 antisymmetric complex matrix .",
    "it can be used to completely express physical observables in ness , such as particle / spin densities , currents , etc .",
    "we demonstrate the power of this novel method by applying it to the problem of heat and spin transport far from equilibrium in nearest neighbor heisenberg xy spin @xmath3 chains subject to a transverse magnetic field . as a result",
    "we reproduce _ ballistic transport _ in the _ integrable _ spatially homogeneous case ( see e.g. @xcite for related recent studies of quantum thermal conductivity in one dimension ) , and predict _ ideally insulating _ behaviour ( at all temperatures ) in a disordered case of spatially random interactions / field . apart from obtaining numerical results which go by far beyond what was so far accessible by direct numerical solution of the many - particle lindblad equation , either directly or by means of quantum trajectories @xcite",
    ", we also obtain two notable analytical results in the spatially homogeneous ( non - disordered ) case : ( i ) we compute the spectral gap of the liouvillean i.e. the rate of of relaxation to the ness and show that it scales with the inverse cube of the chain length .",
    "( ii ) we construct _ evanescent _ normal master modes of the liouvillean , for long chains , by which we explain quantitatively the exponential falloff of energy density or temperature profiles near the bath contacts .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sect : method ] we shall outline a general method for the diagonalization of the liouvillean super - operator for finite quadratic open fermi systems and an explicit construction of ness . in section [ sect : trivia ] we illustrate the method by working out a simple example of a single fermion or a two level quantum system in a bath . in section [",
    "sect : nontrivia ] we demonstrate the usefulness of the new method by applying it to quantum transport in xy spin chains . in section [",
    "sect : conc ] we discuss possible alternative applications and generalizations of the method and reach some conclusions .",
    "the general master equation governing time evolution of the density matrix @xmath6 of an open quantum system , preserving trace and positivity of @xmath7 , can be written in the lindblad form @xcite as ( we set @xmath8 ) @xmath9 + \\sum_{\\mu } \\left(2 l_\\mu \\rho l_\\mu^\\dagger - \\{l_\\mu^\\dagger l_\\mu,\\rho\\ } \\right ) \\label{eq : lind}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is a hermitian operator ( hamiltonian ) , @xmath11:=xy - yx$ ] , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are arbitrary operators representing couplings to different baths ( at possibly different values of thermodynamic potentials ) .",

    "will designate a vector ( column ) of appropriate scalar valued or operator valued symbols @xmath22 .",
    "two notable examples , to which our formalism is immediately applicable , are : ( i ) canonical fermions @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 or ( ii ) spins @xmath3 with canonical pauli operators @xmath26 , @xmath24 , @xmath27    here we are not concerned with physical criteria for the validity of the so - called markovian approximation under which eq .",
    "( [ eq : lind ] ) is derived , so we shall make no assumptions on the smallness of the bath coupling constants @xmath28 .",
    "we merely consider the lindblad equation ( [ eq : lind ] ) as a possible parametrization of an important subset of _ markovian _ completely positive quantum channels and demonstrate its complete solvability for quadratic systems .",
    "note that generalization of our formalism to _ explicitly time dependent _ hamiltonians @xmath29 and lindblad operators @xmath30 , generating more general and possibly non - markovian open system dynamics , is straightforward .",
    "see e.g. @xcite for a discussion of _",
    "we begin by associating a hilbert space structure @xmath31 to a linear @xmath32 dimensional space @xmath33 of operators , with a canonical basis @xmath34 with @xmath35 _ orthonormal _ with respect to an inner product @xmath36 the form of the canonical basis of the operator space @xmath33 suggests that it is just a usual fock space with an unusual physical interpretation . namely we can define the following set of @xmath4 adjoint _ annihilation linear maps _ @xmath37 over @xmath33 @xmath38 and derive the actions of their hermitian adjoints - the _ creation linear maps _",
    "@xmath39 , @xmath40 : @xmath41 straightforward inspection then shows that they satisfy the canonical anticommutation relations @xmath42 the key is now to realize that the quantum liouville map @xmath43 defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lind],[eq : hamil],[eq : lindb ] ) can be written as a quadratic form in _ adjoint fermi maps _",
    "@xmath44 ( or for short , _ a - fermions _ ) .",
    "of physical operators , including density operators , in a sense of gns construction although here _ all _ spaces will be _ finite _ dimensional .",
    "symbols with a _ hat _ shall designate _ linear maps _ over the operator space @xmath33 .",
    "for instance , we note a key distinction between _ physical fermions _ @xmath23 ( [ eq : physfermi ] ) and a - fermions @xmath37 ( [ eq : defanih ] ) . ]",
    "+   + first , we consider the unitary part of liouvillean @xmath45 \\label{eq : exprunitary}\\ ] ] since @xmath33 is a lie algebra , one defines the _ adjoint representation _ of a lie derivative for an arbitrary @xmath46 back on @xmath33 as , @xmath47 \\rangle}}$ ] .",
    "it is now straightforward to compute the action of a lie derivative of a product of two majorana operators on an arbitrary basis element @xmath48 extending this relation by linearity to an arbitrary element of @xmath33 , it follows that for an arbitrary quadratic hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamil ] ) its lie derivative has a very similar quadratic form in a - fermi maps @xmath49 it is worth stressing here that for an arbitrary ( complex ) matrix @xmath19 , @xmath50 ( [ eq : unitary ] ) conserves the total number of a - fermions @xmath51 , namely @xmath52 = 0 $ ] .",
    "+   + second , we consider the action of the lindblad maps @xmath53 where we write @xmath54 .",
    "again we proceed by computing the actions of @xmath55 on elements of the canonical basis of operator fock space @xmath33 . in order to do so , it is crucial to observe that the question whether @xmath15 commutes or anticommutes with @xmath56 depends on the number of a - fermions @xmath57 in @xmath34 , namely @xmath58 , and hence @xmath59 { { \\vert p_{{{\\underline{\\alpha } } } } \\rangle } } \\label{eq : ljk1}\\ ] ] observing that @xmath60 one derives from ( [ eq : ljk1 ] ) the general expression for @xmath55 @xmath61 obviously , the maps @xmath55 , and hence also the total lindblad part of liouvillean @xmath62 , do not conserve the number of a - fermions .",
    "but they conserve its _ parity _ i.e. the product of any two creation / annihilation a - fermi maps commutes with the parity operation @xmath63 , with respect to which the operator space can be decomposed into a direct sum @xmath64 , and even / odd operator spaces are orthogonally projected as @xmath65 .",
    "thus the positive parity subspace @xmath66 is a linear space spanned by @xmath34 with _ even _ @xmath67 .",
    "all the maps @xmath55 now act separately on @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "for example , the maps defined on even parity subspace are indeed quadratic in a - fermions @xmath70 in this paper we shall focus on physical observables which are products of an _ even _ number of majorana fermions ",
    "operators @xmath15  so we shall in the following discuss only liouville dynamics on the subspace @xmath66 . the extension to the dynamics of _ odd",
    "_ observables should be straightforward .",
    "putting the results ( [ eq : exprunitary],[eq : unitary],[eq : exprlindb],[eq : lindbpart ] ) together we arrive at the final compact quadratic representation of the liouvillean @xmath71 @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a complex hermitian matrix parametrizing the lindblad operators @xmath74      next we want to show that the representation ( [ eq : liouv1 ] ) allows us to reduce it further by a linear transformation of the set of maps @xmath75 to _ normal master modes _ ( nmm ) in terms of which the complete spectrum of the liouvillean , as well as its eigenvectors , can be explicitly constructed ; in particular the zero - mode eigenvector which is just the physically relevant ness .",
    "in fact we proceed in analogy to lieb _",
    "_ @xcite and define @xmath76 adjoint hermitian majorana maps @xmath77 , @xmath78 : @xmath79 satisfying the anti - commutation relations @xmath80 in terms of which the liouvillean ( [ eq : liouv1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is an antisymmetric complex @xmath5 matrix with entries @xmath83 @xmath84 is an identity map over @xmath33 and @xmath85 is a scalar @xmath86 obviously , the _ bi - linear _ liouvillean ( [ eq : liouv2 ] ) can not be brought to a normal form with a linear _ canonical _ transformation since the matrix @xmath82  which shall in the following be referred to as a _ shape matrix _ of liouvillean  is not anti - hermitian like in hamiltonian systems .",
    "so we should proceed in more general terms .",
    "we first recall few facts about complex antisymmetric matrices of even dimension . if @xmath87 is a _ right _",
    "eigenvector @xmath88 with complex eigenvalue @xmath89 , then @xmath87 is also a _ left _ eigenvector with eigenvalue @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "hence eigenvalues always come in pairs @xmath92 .",
    "let as assume that @xmath82 can be _ diagonalized _ ) guarantees diagonalizability of any such @xmath82 .",

    "rapidities_. it is easy to check that we can always choose and normalize @xmath98 such that the proof of this statement is a trivial consequence of antisymmetry @xmath99 , whereas in case of degeneracies it can be shown that one can always choose appropriate linear combinations of eigenvectors . ]",
    "@xmath100 let @xmath101 be @xmath5 matrix whose @xmath102th row is given by @xmath98 , @xmath103 .",
    "( [ eq : eigv],[eq : norm ] ) rewrite as @xmath104 expressing @xmath105 in terms of ( [ eq : vvj ] ) and plugging the result into eq .",
    "( [ eq : avvd ] ) we arrive at a very convenient canonical form of a generic complex antisymmetric matrix @xmath82 @xmath106    now we apply decomposition ( [ eq : canform ] ) to the liouvillean ( [ eq : liouv2 ] ) @xmath107 let us define the nmm maps @xmath108 or @xmath109 we note that due to ( [ eq : clifa],[eq : norm ] ) nmm maps satisfy _ almost - canonical _ anti - commutation relations @xmath110 namely @xmath111 could be interpreted as annihilation map and @xmath112 as a creation map of @xmath113th nmm , but we should note that @xmath112 is in general _ not _ the hermitian adjoint of @xmath111 @xcite . in terms of nmm",
    "the liouvillean ( [ eq : liouv4 ] ) now achieves a very convenient normal form @xmath114 where @xmath115 .",
    "we shall later show that the constant @xmath116 is in fact equal to @xmath117 .",
    "the liouvillean can always be represented in terms of a large but finite @xmath118 matrix .",
    "we shall now outline the procedure of complete construction of its spectrum in terms of nmm which are easy to calculate in terms of diagonalization of @xmath1 matrix @xmath82 as described in the previous subsection .",
    "we proceed by constructing the liouvillean ` vacuum ' . from the representation ( [ eq : liouv1 ] ) it follows immediately that @xmath119 is left - annihilated by @xmath120 , @xmath121 , or equivalently @xmath122 .",
    "so we have just shown that @xmath117 is always an eigenvalue of @xmath120 , hence there should also exist the corresponding right eigenvector @xmath123 , normalized as @xmath124 , which represents physical ness , i.e. stationary solutions of the lindblad equation ( [ eq : lind ] ) @xmath125 let us define nmm number maps as @xmath126 . from eqs .",
    "( [ acar ] ) it follows that @xmath127 satisfy a projection property @xmath128 , so they are diagonalizable since no nontrivial jordan block could satisfy the projection property .",
    "furthermore , @xmath127 are mutually commuting @xmath129=0 $ ] , so they can be simultaneously diagonalized and there should exist a vacuum state on which all @xmath127 have value 0 .",
    "it follows from the stability of completely positive evolution ( [ eq : lind ] ) that all eigenvalues @xmath130 of @xmath120 should obey @xmath131 , and since by assumption @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath123 should be the left and right vacua which are simultaneously annihilated by nmm maps @xmath134 and hence also @xmath135 .",
    "thus we have also shown that the nmm representation ( [ eq : liouv3 ] ) is only consistent",
    "if @xmath136 so we find an interesting sum rule for rapidities @xmath137    the complete excitation spectrum and the corresponding left / right eigenvectors of the liouvillean are given in terms of a sequence of @xmath4 binary integers ( nmm occupation numbers ) @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 namely @xmath141 where by construction , left and right eigenvectors satisfy the bi - orthonormality relation @xmath142 .",
    "given a _ physical observable _",
    "@xmath143 and an _ arbitrary _ initial state with a density operator @xmath144 , the time dependent expectation value of @xmath145 can be written in terms of the spectral resolution of the liouvillean , @xmath146 namely @xmath147 = \\sum_{{{\\underline{\\nu } } } } \\exp(t\\lambda_{{{\\underline{\\nu}}}}){{\\langle \\theta^{\\rm l}_{{{\\underline{\\nu } } } } \\vert}}\\rho_0 x{{\\vert \\theta^{\\rm r}_{{{\\underline{\\nu } } } } \\rangle } } \\label{eq : timedeptexp}\\ ] ] we remind the reader that @xmath120 correctly represents physical liouvillean only on the subspace @xmath66 of operators with _ even _ number of a - fermions .",
    "however , since the dynamics is closed on @xmath66 and test physical observable @xmath145 also belongs to @xmath66 it follows that the component of @xmath148 from @xmath149 does not contribute to the expectation value @xmath150 .",
    "given the exact and explicit constructions developed in this section we can now make the following rigorous and useful conclusions , assuming throughout that liouvillean shape matrix @xmath82 is diagonalizable : +   + * theorem 1 : * ness of lindblad equation ( [ eq : lind ] ) is _ unique _ if and only if the rapidity spectrum @xmath151 does not contain @xmath117 , in our ordering convention , if @xmath152 .",
    "in the opposite case , if we have @xmath153 vanishing rapidities , then we have a @xmath154 dimensional convex set of non - equilibrium steady states which can be spanned with @xmath155 .",
    "+   + * theorem 2 : * an arbitrary initial state with a density operator @xmath144 converges with time to ness if and only if all rapidities have _ strictly positive _ real parts , @xmath156 .",
    "then , the rate of exponential relaxation to ness is given by the _ spectral gap _ @xmath157 of the liouvillean which equals @xmath158 .",
    "+   + * theorem 3 : * assume that the rapidity spectrum does not contain 0 , i.e. @xmath159 . then the expectation value of any quadratic observable @xmath160 in a ( unique ) ness can be explicitly computed as @xmath161    the statements of theorems 1 and 2 simply follow from exact and explicit spectral decomposition ( [ eq : eval],[eq : evec],[eq : propag ] ) .",
    "the proof of theorem 3 is also straightforward : the first expression ( [ eq : pairwise ] ) follows from the definition of the annihilation maps ( [ eq : defanih ] ) and the explicit representation of the density operator of ness , @xmath162 , in the canonical basis @xmath56 .",
    "the second , very useful equality ( [ eq : pairwise2 ] ) is then obtained by expressing @xmath163 thru ( [ eq : aexpr ] ) in terms of nmm maps ( [ eq : bexpr ] ) and using the annihilation relations ( [ eq : anihb ] ) .    the quadratic correlator of theorem 3 covers many physically interesting observables such as densities or currents .",
    "however if one needs expectation values of more general observables , e.g. an expectation value of a high order monomial @xmath164 , then one may use a _ wick theorem _ and rewrite it as a sum of products of pair - wise contractions ( [ eq : pairwise ] ) .",
    "in order to illustrate the method and demonstrate convenience of the results derived in the previous section we first work out a simple example of a single fermion @xmath165 ( or equivalently , an arbitrary qubit , a two - level quantum system ) , in a thermal bath . we take the most general single fermion hamiltonian @xmath166 and the following bath operators ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath167 where the ratio of coupling constants determine the bath temperature @xmath168 , @xmath169 . leaving out the details of a straightforward calculation , simply following the steps of the previous section , we arrive at the following shape matrix of the liouvillean ( [ eq : liouv2 ] ) @xmath170 where @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "further , we compute nmm rapidities @xmath173 and the eigenvector matrix @xmath174 then , using theorem 3 we compute the expectation value of occupation number @xmath175 which is what we expect in canonical equilibrium .",
    "here we work out a physically more interesting example , namely we construct ness for the magnetic and heat transport of a heisenberg xy spin @xmath3 chain , with arbitrary  either homogeneous or positionally dependent ( e.g. disordered )  nearest neighbour interaction @xmath176 which is coupled to _ two _ thermal / magnetic baths _ at the ends _ of the chain , generated by two pairs of canonical lindblad operators @xcite ( similar to ( [ eq : canlind ] ) ) @xmath177 where @xmath178 and @xmath179 are positive coupling constants related to bath temperatures / magnetizations , for example if spins were non - interacting the bath temperatures @xmath180 would be given with @xmath181 .    applying the inverse of jordan - wigner transformation ( [ eq : jordan ] ) , @xmath182 , @xmath183 , we rewrite ( [ eq : hamsc],[eq : bathsc ] ) in terms of majorana fermions @xmath184 where @xmath185 is a casimir operator which commutes with all the elements of the clifford algebra generated by @xmath15 and squares to unity @xmath186 .",
    "therefore , @xmath187 _ does not affect _ the action of bath operators ( [ eq : exprlindb ] ) where @xmath13 enter quadratically , so we find @xmath188 leading to the bath shape matrix ( [ eq : canbath ] ) identical to the single fermion case ( [ eq : canlind ] )",
    ". again , carefully following the steps of section [ sect : method ] , we derive the liouvillean in the form ( [ eq : liouv2 ] ) with @xmath5 shape matrix , which we write in a _ block tridiagonal _ form in terms of @xmath189 matrices as @xmath190 and @xmath191 , where @xmath192 , @xmath193 ( in terms of ( [ eq : canbath ] ) ) , with @xmath194 , and @xmath195 we are not able to perform a complete diagonalization of the antisymmetric matrix @xmath82 ( [ eq : biga ] ) of the general xy model analytically . for example , even in the spatially homogeneous case @xmath196 it is not possible to proceed like in the classical harmonic oscillator chain where the corresponding matrix is a sum of a toeplitz and a bordered matrix @xcite .",
    "namely , in our case @xmath82 is a sum of a _ block toeplitz _ and _ block bordered _ matrix and its explicit exact diagonalization remains an open problem .",
    "however , we stress that even relying on numerical diagonalization of @xmath82 yielding a set of rapidities @xmath97 and properly normalized eigenvector matrix @xmath101 , represents a dramatic progress with respect to previously existing numerical methods which needed diagonalization of matrices which were exponentially large in @xmath0",
    ". we shall later derive some exact theoretical and analytical results , explaining results of exact numerical computations , in the special case of a _ homogeneous _ transverse ising chain ( subsection [ sect : ti ] ) , and the case of a _ disordered _ xy chain ( subsection [ sect : disord ] ) for which we shall relate nmm to the problem of anderson localization in one dimension ,    let us continue by discussing transport observables in the spin chain whose expectation values in ness are easy to calculate . note that the bulk hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamsc ] ) can be written in terms of the two - body _ energy density _",

    "[ fig : disprofile ] ]    with the picture of localization of nmm in mind , the effect of the couplings to the heat baths at the chain s ends on quantum transport can be predicted by theoretical arguments ( see @xcite for a review of related studies ) : the spectral gap of the liouvillean should be exponentially small @xmath316 where @xmath317 is the localization length of nmm which is expected to be proportional to the square of inverse disorder strength .",

    "the method can be considered as a simple alternative to the solution of quantum langevin equations @xcite .    however , the method should easily be applicable to variety of other physical situations , for example if all fermions are coupled to the baths one could make a solvable model of genuine quantum diffusion , a many - body generalization of the tight - binding model @xcite .",
    "we also expect the method to be applicable to the redfield type of master equations ( see e.g. @xcite ) - which do not conserve positivity for a short initial ( slippage ) time interval - provided only the system part of the hamiltonian is _ quadratic _ and system - bath couplings are _ linear _ in fermionic variables .",
