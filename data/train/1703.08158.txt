    "the experimental data used in this paper were collected by the forward looking radar of the us  army research laboratory @xcite . that radar was built for detection and possible identification of shallow explosive - like targets .",
    "since targets are three dimensional objects , one needs to measure a three dimensional information about each target .",
    "however , the radar measures only one time dependent curve for each target , see figure 5 .",
    "therefore , one can hope to reconstruct only a very limited information about each target .",
    "so , we reconstruct only an estimate of the dielectric constant of each target . for each target ,",
    "our estimate likely provides a sort of an average of values of its spatially distributed dielectric constant .",
    "but even this information can be potentially very useful for engineers .",
    "indeed , currently the radar community is relying only on the energy information of radar images , see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "estimates of dielectric constants of targets , if taken alone , can not improve the current false alarm rate .",
    "however , these estimates can be potentially used as an additional piece of information .",
    "being combined with the currently used energy information , this piece of the information might result in the future in new classification algorithms , which might improve the current false alarm rate .",
    "an inverse medium scattering problem ( imsp ) is often also called a coefficient inverse problem ( cip ) .",
    "imsps / cips are both ill - posed and highly nonlinear .",
    "therefore , an important question to address in a numerical treatment of such a problem is : _ how to reach a sufficiently small neighborhood of the exact coefficient without any advanced knowledge of this neighborhood ? _ the size of this neighborhood should depend only on the level of noise in the data and on approximation errors .",
    "we call a numerical method , which has a rigorous guarantee of achieving this goal , _ globally convergent method _ ( gcm ) .    in this paper",
    "we develop analytically a new globally convergent method for a 1-d inverse medium scattering problem ( imsp ) with the data generated by multiple frequencies .",
    "in addition to the analytical study , we test this method numerically using both computationally simulated and the above mentioned experimental data .    first , we derive a nonlinear integro - differential equation in which the unknown coefficient is not present .",
    "_ element _ of this paper is the method of the solution of this equation .",
    "this method is based on the construction of a weighted least squares cost functional .",
    "the key point of this functional is the presence of the carleman weight function ( cwf ) in it .",
    "this is the function , which is involved in the carleman estimate for the underlying differential operator .",
    "we prove that , given a closed ball of an arbitrary radius @xmath1 with the center at @xmath2 in an appropriate hilbert space , one can choose the parameter @xmath3 of the cwf in such a way that this functional becomes strictly convex on that ball .",
    "the existence of the unique minimizer on that closed ball as well as convergence of minimizers to the exact solution when the level of noise in the data tends to zero are proven .",
    "in addition ,  it is proven that the gradient projection method reaches a sufficiently small neighborhood of the exact coefficient if its starting point is an arbitrary point of that ball .",
    "the size of that neighborhood is proportional to the level of noise in the data .",
    "therefore , since restrictions on @xmath4 are not imposed in our method , then this is a _ globally convergent _ numerical method .",
    "we note that in the conventional case of a non convex cost functional a gradient - like method converges to the exact solution only if its starting point is located in a sufficiently small neighborhood of this solution : this is due to the phenomenon of multiple local minima and ravines of such functionals .    unlike previously developed globally convergent numerical methods of the first type for cips ( see this section below ) , the convergence analysis for the technique of the current paper does not impose a smallness condition on the interval @xmath5 of the variations of the wave numbers @xmath6 .",
    "the majority of currently known numerical methods of solutions of nonlinear ill - posed problems use the nonlinear optimization . in other words ,",
    "a least squares cost functional is minimized in each problem , see , e.g. chavent , engl , gonch1,gonch2 . however , the major problem with these functionals is that they are usually non convex .",
    "figure 1 of the paper scales presents a numerical example of multiple local minima and ravines of non - convex least squares cost functionals for some cips .",
    "hence , convergence of the optimization process of such a functional to the exact solution can be guaranteed only if a good approximation for that solution is known in advance .",
    "however , such an approximation is rarely available in applications .",
    "this prompts the development of globally convergent numerical methods for cips , see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the first author with coauthors has proposed two types of gcm for cips with single measurement data .",
    "the gcm of the first type is reasonable to call the tail functions method `` . this development has started from the work @xcite and has been continued since then , see , e.g. @xcite and references cited therein . in this case",
    ", on each step of an iterative process one solves the dirichlet boundary value problem for a certain linear elliptic pde , which depends on that iterative step .",
    "the solution of this pde allows one to update the unknown coefficient first and then to update a certain function , which is called the tail function '' . the convergence theorems for this method impose a smallness condition on the interval of the variation of either the parameter @xmath7 of the laplace transform of the solution of a hyperbolic equation or of the wave number @xmath8 in the helmholtz equation .",
    "recall that the method of this paper does not impose the latter assumption .",
    "in this paper we present a new version of the gcm of the second type . in any version of the gcm of the second type",
    "a weighted cost functional with a cwf in it is constructed .",
    "the same properties of the global strict convexity and the global convergence of the gradient projection method hold as the ones indicated above .",
    "the gcm of the second type was initiated in klib95,klib97,kt with a recently renewed interest in @xcite .",
    "the idea of any version of the gcm of the second type has direct roots in the method of @xcite , which is based on carleman estimates and which was originally designed in @xcite only for proofs of uniqueness theorems for cips , also see the recent survey in @xcite .    another version of the gcm with a cwf in it was recently developed in bau1 for a cip for the hyperbolic equation @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the unknown coefficient .",
    "this gcm was tested numerically in @xcite . in bau1,bau2 non - vanishing conditions",
    "are imposed : it is assumed that either @xmath11 or @xmath12 or @xmath13 in the entire domain of interest .",
    "similar assumptions are imposed in @xcite for the gcm of the second type . on the other hand , we consider in the current paper ,",
    "so as in @xcite , the fundamental solution of the corresponding pde .",
    "the differences between the fundamental solutions of those pdes and solutions satisfying non - vanishing conditions cause quite significant differences between klib95,klib97,kt , ktsiap and @xcite of corresponding versions of the gcm of the second type .",
    "recently , the idea of the gcm of the second type was extended to the case of ill - posed cauchy problems for quasilinear pdes , see the theory in klquasi and some extensions and numerical examples in bakklkosh , klkosh .",
    "cips of wave propagation are a part of a bigger subfield , inverse scattering problems ( isps ) .",
    "isps attract a significant attention of the scientific community . in this",
    "regard we refer to some direct methods which successfully reconstruct positions , sizes and shapes of scatterers without iterations @xcite .",
    "we also refer to @xcite for some other isps in the frequency domain . in addition",
    ", we cite some other numerical methods for isps considered in @xcite .    as to the cips with multiple measurement , i.e. the dirichlet - to - neumann map data , we mention recent works @xcite and references cited therein , where reconstruction procedures are developed , which do not require a priori knowledge of a small neighborhood of the exact coefficient .    in section 2 we state our inverse problem .",

    "we prove the main property of this functional : its global strict convexity . in section 5",
    "we prove the global convergence of the gradient projection method of the minimization of this functional .",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> a new numerical method is proposed for a 1-d inverse medium scattering problem with multi - frequency data . </S>",
    "<S> this method is based on the construction of a weighted cost functional . </S>",
    "<S> the weight is a carleman weight function ( cwf ) . in other words , this is the function , which is present in the carleman estimate for the undelying differential operator . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of the cwf makes this functional strictly convex on any a priori chosen ball with the center at @xmath0 in an appropriate hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> convergence of the gradient minimization method to the exact solution starting from any point of that ball is proven . </S>",
    "<S> computational results for both computationally simulated and experimental data show a good accuracy of this method .    * </S>",
    "<S> key words * : global convergence , coefficient inverse problem , multi - frequency data , carleman weight function    * 2010 mathematics subject classification : * 35r30 . </S>"
