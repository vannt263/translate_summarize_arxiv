    "excess emission at infrared wavelengths has been frequently used to identify those stars that have circumstellar disks . @xcite",
    "have shown that disk surveys that utilize 1 - 2.5  @xmath0 m photometry exclusively are usually incomplete , and only by inclusion of longer wavelength photometry can a more complete disk sample be achieved .",
    "such samples , once obtained , allow unbiased measurements of the fraction of sources with circumstellar disks in a young stellar cluster .",
    "combined with spectroscopically - derived stellar ages , cluster disk fractions may provide insight into the average disk lifetime @xcite .",
    "surveying multiple and more distant clusters with ground - based @xmath5band imaging is impractical however , as atmospheric emission severely limits sensitivity .    using the infrared array camera ( irac ) onboard the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite , we can efficiently observe at 3 - 8  @xmath0 m with dramatically improved sensitivity , enabling us to obtain a significant census of the yso population in young stellar clusters .",
    "specifically , the 4.5  @xmath0 m channel on irac has optimal sensitivity to both photospheric and disk emission .",
    "when combined with ground - based @xmath6 imaging , these new data allow unbiased measurements of the disk fractions of young stellar clusters at distances as large as 1  kpc , increasing the number of clusters that can be studied this way significantly . in this paper , we present just such a young stellar object ( yso ) census for the star forming region ngc  7129 to demonstrate the capabilities of irac/_spitzer_.    located at a distance of 1  kpc @xcite , ngc  7129 is a region of bright reflection nebulosity at optical wavelengths , illuminated by the be stars bd+@xmath7 and bd+@xmath8 .",
    "these two intermediate mass stars are part of a cluster of low mass stars @xcite which occupies a cavity west of a kidney - shaped molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "the cavity is sharply defined in both co and submillimeter emission @xcite , and the cavity wall is seen as a nebulous filament detected at both optical and near ir wavelengths .",
    "a third massive member , lkh@xmath9  234 , lies to the east of the main cluster on the edge of the cavity .",
    "an optical jet pointing southwest into the cavity has been associated with it @xcite or one of its companions @xcite and may be the counter - jet to a red - shifted molecular outflow lobe detected to the northeast .",
    "three arcminutes to the south of the cluster lies firs2 , a deeply embedded intermediate - mass protostellar object located at the primary peak in @xmath10co emission @xcite and associated with a multipolar molecular outflow @xcite .",
    "there are several known herbig - haro objects in and around the region , many of which are associated with sites of outflow activity @xcite .",
    "for information on the irac instrument , see @xcite .",
    "the irac/_spitzer _ observations were taken as part of the spitzer young stellar cluster survey .",
    "the observations are described in detail by @xcite .    near  ir observations of the region in the @xmath11  ( 1.2  @xmath0 m ) , @xmath12  ( 1.6  @xmath0 m ) , and @xmath13  ( 2.2  @xmath0 m ) wavebands were obtained by the authors on june  15 ,  2001 using the flamingos instrument @xcite on the 6.5 meter mmt telescope .",
    "a 2  @xmath14  2 position raster was used to make a @xmath15 mosaic .",
    "five dithered mosaics were obtained in each band , for a total exposure time of 75  seconds at @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "the data were processed using custom idl routines developed by the authors for ground - based near  ir data reduction which include modules for linearization , flat - field creation and application , background frame creation and subtraction , distortion measurement and correction , and mosaicking .",
    "point source detection and aperture photometry of all point sources were carried out using photvis version 1.09 , an idl gui - based photometry visualization tool developed by gutermuth .",
    "photvis utilizes daophot modules ported to idl as part of the idl astronomy user s library @xcite .",
    "detections were visually inspected and those that were identified as structured nebulosity were considered non - stellar and rejected .",
    "radii of the apertures and inner and outer limits of the sky annuli were 1@xmath3 , 2@xmath3 , and 3.2@xmath3 respectively for the near  ir data and 2.4@xmath3 , 2.4@xmath3 , and 7.2@xmath3 respectively for the irac data .",
    "flamingos photometry was calibrated by minimizing residuals to corresponding 2mass detections , using only those objects with @xmath16 @xmath17 0.6 mag to minimize color differences in the 2mass and flamingos filter sets .",
    "photometry for stars that were non - linear or saturated in the flamingos data were replaced with the appropriate 2mass measurements in the final analysis .",
    "irac photometry was calibrated using large aperture measurements of several standard stars from observations obtained in flight .",
    "an additional correction was derived and applied for each channel to correct for the smaller apertures used in this study .",
    "the four - color composite irac image is shown in figure  [ image ] .",
    "we note two different types of extended emission .",
    "the brightest and most extended nebulosity is the reflection nebula , which is most prominent in the 8.0  @xmath0 m ( red ) band .",
    "this band includes the 7.7  @xmath0 m emission feature commonly attributed to pahs . in addition ,",
    "4.5  @xmath0m - bright ( green ) structured shocks and knots associated with outflow activity are easily discernible at two sites located south and east of the cavity .",
    "the preponderance of outflow activity outside the cluster core suggests that current star formation activity is ongoing in the molecular cloud .    centered in the reflection nebulosity is the cluster of stars most apparent in the near  ir @xcite . using our @xmath13band star counts , we determined the location of the peak local stellar surface density , and measured the radial stellar surface density profile centered on this point .",
    "we measured the half - width at half maximum density from this profile to be approximately 0.17  pc , and defined the boundary of the cluster core as a circle centered on the stellar density peak with a radius of three times this distance , or 0.5  pc @xcite .",
    "to identify the population of young , forming stars with ir excess ( circumstellar disks ) we use an @xmath1 $ ]  vs.  @xmath2 color - color diagram for all stars detected at @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 with photometric uncertainties of less than 0.1  magnitudes and 4.5  @xmath0 m ( fig .",
    "[ all]b ) with photometric uncertainties of less than 0.25  magnitudesm band error estimates . ] .",
    "we interpret those that exhibit colors inconsistent with reddened dwarf or giant stars as stars with circumstellar disks .",
    "we used the reddening law of @xcite for this analysis , interpolated to take into account the filter response of the 4.5  @xmath0 m channel of irac .",
    "we have restricted this study to only those objects with dereddened @xmath11band magnitudes less than 16.5 , equivalent to the luminosity of a 1  myr old 0.06  m@xmath18 or a 3  myr old 0.08  m@xmath18 star @xcite at the adopted distance .",
    "an age of 3  myr was chosen as a conservative upper limit for the age of the cluster core population , although it is clear from the presence of protostellar objects reported in this paper and the companion studies that there are much younger stars present in the molecular cloud .",
    "the positions of those objects with ir excess are plotted as green diamonds in figure  [ image ] .",
    "we find 84 objects with disks out of a total of 405 objects that are detected in all four bands within the above constraints . of these",
    ", 42 out of the 87 that are located within the cluster core boundary have disks .",
    "note that the cluster core has a significantly higher density of objects with disks compared with the rest of the field even though the 4.5  @xmath0 m sensitivity is significantly reduced because of the bright nebulosity in the cavity .",
    "nevertheless , the total number of stars with disks detected both inside and outside the cluster core boundary is similar .",
    "most of this peripheral star formation appears to be located in parts of the molecular cloud north , east , and south of lkh@xmath9  234 .",
    "there are also several stars with ir excess near the western edge of the reflection nebula",
    ". these may be young stars with disks from the core that have emerged from the molecular cloud , or they could be background galaxies , planetary nebulae , or agb stars .",
    "the irac colors and the number of these potential contaminating objects are currently not well characterized , but given the small number of ir excess sources detected away from the molecular cloud , these contaminants are not expected to alter the deduced disk frequency significantly .    for comparison ,",
    "red points are also plotted in figure  [ image ] to mark those ysos detected and classified using only the four irac bands @xcite , and white points mark those ysos detected and classified using the irac and mips combined colors @xcite .",
    "these methods complement each other well , as the longer wavelengths suffer from loss of sensitivity in the bright central nebulosity , whereas the near ir data in this study can not detect sources in the heavily extinguished regions of the molecular cloud .",
    "it is clear in all these studies that in addition to the dense cluster core there is an extended population of young stars predominantly located in the eastern molecular cloud .      to achieve an unbiased sample of stars in the ngc  7129 cluster for measurement of the fraction of stars with disks ,",
    "we first restrict our sample to objects detected at @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 wavelengths within the cluster core boundary .",
    "we then plot our sample on a @xmath2  vs.  @xmath11 color - magnitude diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ frac1 ] ) , marking the stars which are also detected at 4.5  @xmath0 m .",
    "since stars with disks are substantially more luminous at 4.5  @xmath0 m , the disk fraction can be overestimated if we select sources on the basis of the irac photometry . by basing our sample selection on the dereddened @xmath11band magnitude , which is dominated by the emission from the stellar photosphere @xcite",
    ", we avoid this bias .",
    "furthermore , by adopting a modest maximum extinction , we are sampling all stars above the magnitude limit within the spatial volume defined by our cluster core boundary and the extinction limit .",
    "we choose a dereddened @xmath11 magnitude upper limit of 15.5 , corresponding to the luminosity of a 1  myr old 0.1  m@xmath18 star or a 3  myr old 0.2  m@xmath18 star @xcite at the adopted distance , and an extinction upper limit of a@xmath19  6  mag ( a@xmath20  1.7  mag ) .",
    "these limits are chosen such that 90% of the stars in the sample have corresponding 4.5  @xmath0 m detections , with the non - detections evenly distributed on the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "we also take the same sample from nearby control fields on the edge of our mosaic . from this",
    "we estimate 20% of the stars in the final cluster core sample are field stars .",
    "those stars that remain in our final sample are plotted on the @xmath1 $ ]  vs.  @xmath2 color - color diagram in figure  [ frac2 ] .",
    "all stars to the right and below the reddening vector originating at the m5 dwarf colors are considered to have excess emission at 4.5  @xmath0 m and therefore circumstellar disks . of the 62 stars in the final sample ,",
    "32 have disks .",
    "if 20% of the sample of 62 stars are in fact background stars , then only 50 are probable cluster members , yielding a high estimated disk fraction of 64% .",
    "if we reject all those objects within 1 sigma of the m5 reddening vector as before , the total number of objects with disks drops to 27 , for a total of 54%  @xmath4  14% .",
    "the statistical uncertainty is derived assuming poisson counting statistics for the number of stars with excesses , the total number of stars in the cluster core , and the number of stars in our control fields used for determining background contamination .",
    "as demonstrated clearly in figure  [ all ] , combining the longer wavelength irac data with the near  ir data is a more robust method for the detection of circumstellar disks than @xmath6-based methods allow .",
    "the photospheres of both ordinary stars and young stars are characterized well by @xmath11 and @xmath12 bands , but detecting the warm inner disks at @xmath21band is uncertain because of the relative weakness of disk emission compared to that from photospheres at 2.2  @xmath0 m .",
    "the spectral energy distributions of protostellar disks dominate photospheric seds at wavelengths longer than 2.2  @xmath0 m , allowing easier detection if adequate sensitivity can be achieved , as has been done with irac/_spitzer_. for disk fraction studies specifically , the 4.5  @xmath0 m channel of irac has the ideal combination of sensitivity to both photospheric and disk emission needed for unbiased sampling of the entire stellar population , both with and without disks .",
    "we measure a disk fraction of 54% for the cluster core of ngc  7129 .",
    "when compared to other long wavelength ( @xmath22 ) measurements , we note that the disk fraction in ngc  7129 is significantly lower than 80% reported for the trapezium cluster by @xcite and 86% in ngc 2024 as reported by @xcite .",
    "both of these clusters are considered to be very young ( @xmath17  1  myr ) .",
    "however , our result is fairly close to that found for the 2.3  myr cluster ic  348 , which has a disk fraction of 65% @xcite , and the 3.2  myr cluster ngc  2264 which has 52% @xcite .",
    "future work will be focused on measuring the age of the ngc  7129 cluster core to compare with the disk lifetime study presented in @xcite .    while this study concentrated on the cluster core , the significant number of young stars and protostellar objects outside the core is evidence of active extended star formation in this region .",
    "star counts using our @xmath13band photometry in the cluster core and in our control fields suggest there are approximately 80 cluster members down to @xmath23  16  mag .",
    "this sensitivity allows us to reach unattenuated 1 - 3  myr old objects down to 0.055  m@xmath18 @xcite . in the periphery of the cluster we estimate the number of stars with disks at 62 , through a combination of those reported here and the ysos reported in the companion papers @xcite .",
    "most of those ysos that are missed in this study are either outside the coverage of the near  ir data or are highly embedded and thus missing @xmath11band detections .",
    "clearly , the extended cluster population contains a roughly equal number of stars as the high density cluster core , and thus comprises a significant portion of the total stellar content in ngc  7129 .",
    "the bright nebulosity extending from the northeast boundary of the reflection nebula is coincident with a complex of herbig - haro objects , several molecular hydrogen knots , and a co outflow ; these data indicate that the nebulosity is probably heated by shocks , and not by radiation from nearby stars .",
    "although the nebulosity is evident in all four irac bands , it shows a distinctly different color and structure than the reflection nebula , and is particularly prominent in the 4.5  @xmath0 m band .",
    "since this band contains the co fundamental and several h@xmath24 lines , the emission in the 4.5  @xmath0 m band probably has a large component from shock heated molecular gas .",
    "it is still not known whether this region contains one or multiple outflows , nor is it known which sources are driving the outflow .",
    "irac and mips imaging of ngc  7129 have shown four protostellar ( class i ) and two pre - main sequence stars with disks ( class ii ) within the nebulosity ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* this work ) . given the complex shape of the emission , and the presence of multiple protostellar objects , we find it likely that this nebulosity contains the combined emission from several outflows .",
    "several distinct outflow arcs traced by 4.5  @xmath0m - bright knots appear to be associated with firs2 .",
    "the object itself is elongated perpendicular to the extended outflow arcs , suggesting another outflow axis which is resolved as distinct emission knots in our @xmath13band image .",
    "the observed multipolar nature of this outflow system , in general agreement with the the outflow analysis of @xcite , lends support to the claim by @xcite that firs2 is a multiple protostellar system .",
    "we note at least one other obvious outflow arc that does not seem to be associated directly with firs2 .",
    "future work will involve numerical modeling of these resolved outflows to investigate their influence on the star forming environment of the natal molecular cloud .",
    "this work is based on observations made with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology under nasa contract 1407 .",
