    "antiferromagnetic spin systems on fully frustrated lattices show many unusual behaviors in magnetic and thermal properties@xcite .",
    "one of the main ingredients is that their unit cell allows for a continuous degree of freedom and that the connectivity ( corner sharing ) allows for an extensive number of these degrees of freedom in the classical ground state .",
    "more subtle phenomena appear when looking at quantum models on these lattices as quantum fluctuations may induce very unsusual ground states . in particular , wether the quantum ground state on fully frustrated lattices may not break the lattice symmetry nor the spin group symmetry is still a highly debated question .",
    "a lot of work has been done to answer this question in the framework of the proposition of anderson@xcite , looking first at resonating valence bond states .",
    "one of the most studied candidates is the quantum @xmath4=1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet on the kagom lattice . using various methods@xcite",
    ", it has been shown that the low temperature physics should be dominated by short range rvb states which produce a continuum of singlet states between the @xmath5 ground state and the first excited @xmath6 state .",
    "a still controversial question is the presence of a very low temperature peak in the specific heat , much below the one corresponding to the onset of short range correlations , that could be ascribed to a high density of singlet states in the singlet - triplet spin gap .",
    "associated to this low temperature peak is the missing ( or not ) entropy that would characterize an ordered or a disordered ground state .",
    "the experimental relevance of the model is extremely fragile as , in real compounds , many other parameters may drive the physics to very different universality classes , described through inclusion of next nearest neighbor interactions@xcite , disorder@xcite , antisymmetric interactions@xcite , etc ... nevertheless , in many cases , the heisenberg antiferromagnet is a good starting point as it is generally believed that many properties of realistic systems come from deviations from the heisenberg limit .",
    "examples are the layered oxide srcr@xmath7ga@xmath8o@xmath9@xcite ( @xmath10 ) or the organic pseudo-@xmath6 compound m-mpynn.bf@xmath11@xcite .    in this paper , the properties of the heisenberg @xmath4=1/2 kagom antiferromagnet are addressed by using a spin green s functions technique .",
    "one of the advantages of the method is that it is well suited for magnetic systems with no long range order as it uses a decoupling scheme based on short ranged spin correlations .",
    "this method was previously introduced by kondo and yamagi@xcite in the context of the one - dimensional heisenberg model as a theory of spin - waves in absence of long - range order .",
    "more recently , it has been used to address different problems@xcite and can be extended to include magnetic phases@xcite . here , the formalism is used to compute thermodynamic and magnetic quantities at all temperatures , like the internal energy , specific heat , entropy , magnetic susceptibility and structure factor .",
    "correlation functions are also computed at all temperatures and for various separation distances . in the next section ,",
