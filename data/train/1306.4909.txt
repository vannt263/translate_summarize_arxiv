    "diffraction is ubiquitous in any branch of physics that involves waves , including optics , acoustics , and quantum mechanics . for many applications , diffraction is a limitation and several techniques have been proposed for its control",
    ". non - diffracting beam ( ndb ) is the common term used in classical optics to refer to a solution of the wave equation that propagates along a given axis preserving its transverse intensity pattern .",
    "the best known ndb is the bessel beam introduced by durnin et al . in 1987  @xcite .",
    "bessel beams were followed by the discovery of other nondiffracting solutions including mathieu beams , parabolic beams , x - waves , and airy beams  @xcite .",
    "ideal ndbs have an infinite extent and energy , and thus they are not physically realizable . in view of this , high - quality apodized versions of ideal ndb s have been experimentally generated using annular masks , axicons , laser cavities , holograms and light modulators  @xcite .    in the process of spontaneous parametric downconversion ( spdc )",
    "@xcite , individual photons from a pump beam which illuminates a second - order nonlinear crystal may be annihilated with a small probability , each annihilation event leading to the emission of a signal and idler photon pair .",
    "the detection of the idler photon of a given pair may `` herald '' the existence of a single photon in the signal mode ; this is then known as a heralded single photon source .",
    "spdc is remarkable in that the photon pair properties can be widely engineered to fit particular needs  @xcite . for a sufficiently short crystal",
    ", the two - photon state depends solely on the pump , with the resulting spectral ( spatial ) entanglement highly dependent on the pump spectral  @xcite ( transverse @xmath0-vector  @xcite ) amplitude ; these degrees of freedom are in fact linked , e.g. the spatial pump properties may influence the photon - pair spectral properties  @xcite .",
    "past works which exploit spdc together with transversely structured beams , of which ndb s are a sub - category , include the generation of entangled states in modes , e.g. gauss - laguerre , with orbital angular momentum  @xcite . in many of these experiments , the signal and idler fields are projected onto specific transverse @xmath0-vector amplitudes using phase holograms or other optical elements . in this paper",
    "we exploit the fact that for a sufficiently - short crystal , the spatial pump beam properties can be _ directly _ mapped to the two - photon state  @xcite , and in particular to the heralded single - photon ; this is accomplished without the need for projecting , post - generation , the heralded single photon into particular @xmath0-vector distributions  @xcite .",
    "specifically , in our work we directly map the non - diffracting behavior of a bessel - gauss ( bg ) pump beam to the single - photon amplitude of the heralded signal photons .",
    "thus , we take the well understood non - diffracting properties of bg beams into the quantum optics realm .",
    "the ability to control the transverse spatial intensity pattern at the single photon level , while also achieving non - diffracting behavior , is notable .",
    "applications could be found in the area of free - space quantum communications , where the ability of an ndb to maintain its form despite the presence of obstacles  @xcite and/or despite propagation through a turbulent medium  @xcite .",
    "would be particularly useful .",
    "applications could likewise be found in the controlled interaction of single photons with atoms and/or ions in the linear arrangement of an ion trap or an optical lattice .",
    "our main objective in this paper is the generation of non - diffracting single - photon wavepackets . for this purpose , we take advantage of the well - developed field of classical ndb s .",
    "we rely on the process of spdc to generate signal and idler photon pairs in a bulk second - order crystal pumped by a bg beam of frequency @xmath1 .",
    "we detect an idler photon on the fourier plane defined by an @xmath2-@xmath2 optical system following the crystal , which heralds a conjugate signal - photon wavepacket . under ideal conditions the quantum state of the signal photons , conditioned by the detection of an idler photon of frequency @xmath3 and transverse wavevector @xmath4 ,",
    "may be written as follows    @xmath5 of the pump , and where @xmath6 is a single - photon fock state of frequency @xmath7 and transverse wavevector @xmath8 .    here",
    ", ideal conditions refers first to the use of a sufficiently short crystal and second to the use of a conditioning idler - mode detector with sufficiently small transverse dimensions .",
    "indeed , in general the single - photon amplitude in eq .",
    "( [ e : state ] ) should be multiplied by a sinc function factor , determined by crystal properties such as crystal length and poynting vector walk - off ; for a sufficiently short crystal , the width of this factor is much larger than that of the function @xmath9 , so that the former may be disregarded  @xcite .",
    "if the idler detector has a non - zero transverse extent , the signal - mode single - photon state becomes a statistical mixture of states of the form in eq .",
    "( [ e : state ] ) integrated over all @xmath10 values within the angular acceptance of the idler detector .",
    "equation  ( [ e : state ] ) already contains the main physical mechanism which we exploit in this paper : the signal - mode , single - photon amplitude corresponds to the angular amplitude of the pump mode , except displaced in transverse momentum space .",
    "thus , our experiment ( to be described in detail below ) has been designed so that , ideally , the detection of a single idler photon heralds a single signal - mode photon with a transverse amplitude which corresponds to a direct mapping of the pump transverse amplitude .",
    "note that for a plane - wave pump , with @xmath11 , the above mechanism implies that the signal - mode conditional angular spectrum is likewise a delta function @xmath12 . in this paper",
    "our pump beam has a non - zero transverse - momentum width .",
    "in particular , it has a bg transverse amplitude which is mapped to the conditionally - prepared single photons . because bg beams exhibit a non - diffracting character , this behavior",
    "will likewise be presented by the signal - mode single photons conditioned by the detection of an idler photon .",
    "a bg beam is a conical coherent superposition of gaussian beams , each with a radius at the beamwaist parameter @xmath13 , and with a cone opening half - angle @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is transverse wavenumber and @xmath16 is the pump wavenumber . for a bg pump , the function @xmath17",
    "may then be written as    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is a normalization constant and @xmath20 is a zeroth order modified bessel function of the first kind . when viewed in the transverse position @xmath21 domain , the transverse amplitude as",
    "a function of the propagation distance @xmath22 becomes    @xmath23    in terms of @xmath24 with @xmath25 the rayleigh range of the pump , the zeroth - order bessel function @xmath26 and a normalization constant @xmath27 .",
    "a measure of the propagation distance over which the single - photon transverse intensity pattern remains unchanged is given by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the signal wavenumber .",
    "we have prepared a bg beam to be used as pump in a second - order nonlinear crystal , which generates photon pairs through the spdc process . figure  [ fig : setup ]",
    "shows our experimental setup .",
    "a beam from a diode laser , centered at @xmath30 nm with @xmath31mw power is sent through a telescope ( t1 ) with magnification @xmath32 to obtain an approximately gaussian beam with an approximate radius at the beamwaist of @xmath33 mm .",
    "this magnified beam is transmitted through an axicon ( a ) , i.e. a conical lens , with a @xmath34 apex angle , which maps the incoming beam into a high - quality bg beam . as a final preparation step , this beam",
    "is magnified @xmath35 with a telescope ( t2 ) consisting of appropriately separated lenses with focal lengths @xmath36 cm and @xmath37 cm .",

    "[ fig : pump](a ) . the much larger width of the signal - mode angular spectrum annulus , compared to that of the pump ( leading to @xmath55 m vs @xmath56 m for the pump ) , is a consequence of the considerable idler - mode fiber tip width of @xmath50 m ; the observed annulus is given by the incoherent addition of the contributions for each @xmath57 within the angular acceptance of the idler detector .",
    "in addition , the width of the observed annulus is enlarged due to the convolution of the actual annulus with the angular aperture of the ( signal - mode ) scanning fiber tip .",
    "note that the @xmath15 value that could be inferred from the radius of the the most intense region of the annulus in fig .",

    "fig : setup ] ) ; the larger lens diameter is intended to minimize signal - mode @xmath0-vector clipping by the lens aperture . for this measurement , we retain the fixed conditioning idler detector on fp1 and we place the signal - mode fiber tip with a @xmath62 m diameter , rather than @xmath50 m as for fp1 , and scan its transverse position while monitoring signal - idler coincidence counts .",
    "the resulting data , i.e coincidence counts between idler photons collected on fp1 and signal photons collected on fp2 as a function of the position of the signal - mode fiber tip ; see fig .",
