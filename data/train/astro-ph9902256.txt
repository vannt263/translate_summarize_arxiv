    "the observations performed by the heao1 , rosat and asca satellites have allowed a good description of the x  ray background spectrum over a wide energy range from 0.1 to @xmath0 kev .",
    "the intensity above @xmath1 kev has an extragalactic origin , resulting from the summed emission of unresolved sources over all cosmic epochs .",
    "the recent rosat deep survey in the lockman hole has shown that in the soft 0.52.0 kev band nearly @xmath2 of the xrb is already resolved into discrete sources at a limiting flux of @xmath3 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 ( hasinger et al .",
    "the resolved fraction in the 210 kev band is much lower : from a medium sensitivity survey with the asca gis about @xmath6 of the xrb measured by heao1 ( gruber 1992 ) has been resolved at a limiting flux of @xmath7 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 ( cagnoni , della ceca & maccacaro 1998 ) . while nearly @xmath8 of the rosat sources have been optically identified as active galactic nuclei ( agn ; schmidt et al .",
    "1998 ) , the optical counterparts of the asca sample are not fully available yet .",
    "on the other hand it is well known that the 220 kev xrb spectrum , well approximated by a flat power law with energy spectral index @xmath9 , can not be simply reproduced by the emission of quasars and sey 1 galaxies , which have steeper ( @xmath10 ) hard x ",
    "ray spectra ( comastri et al . 1992 ; nandra & pounds 1994 ) .",
    "this apparent contradiction , known as the `` spectral paradox '' ( boldt 1987 ) , has been circumvented by setti & woltjer ( 1989 ) who demonstrated that the main characteristics of the xrb could be reproduced by summing the contributions from unabsorbed ( type 1 ) and absorbed ( type 2 ) agn according to the population ratios predicted by the unification models ( antonucci & miller 1985 ; barthel 1989 ) .",
    "comastri et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have since worked out a detailed model which provides a good fit to the xrb in the broad 3100 kev band and is consistent with all known x ",
    "ray properties of agn classes ( see also madau et al .",
    "other agn models of the xrb do not meet observed constraints on the x  ray spectra and/or source counts ( see setti & comastri 1996 for a review ) .",
    "however , it has been pointed out ( matt & fabian 1994 ) that strong iron features , such as the line at @xmath11 kev and related absorption edge commonly found in seyferts spectra ( nandra & pounds 1994 ) , may lead agn synthesis models to predict a detectable feature in the xrb spectrum at a few kev . since recent asca observations",
    "( gendreau et al .",
    "1995 ) have shown that the 1.710 kev xrb spectral shape is rather smooth and featureless , apart from a narrow bump at @xmath12 kev due to the gold edge in the instrumental response , di matteo & fabian ( 1997 ) have proposed that a new and as yet undetected population of advection  dominated sources with flat x  ray spectra is required to fit the xrb spectrum .    in order to further investigate whether the iron structure in the xrb spectral profile should have been detected ,",
    "we have reconsidered the agn synthesis model of the xrb described by comastri et al .",
    "( 1995 ) adding the iron lines to the input spectra .    throughout this paper the values",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 have been assumed .",
    "the x  ray spectra of seyfert galaxies commonly show radiation excesses in the 57 kev band with respect to a power law continuum .",
    "these are usually interpreted as k@xmath15 iron emission lines from regions reprocessing the nuclear radiation .",
    "the iron line properties strongly depend on the geometry and dynamics of the reprocessing medium . from the energy of the line peak @xmath16 , the width @xmath17 and the equivalent width @xmath18it is possible to identify the emission line regions . in most cases",
    "it is found that @xmath19 kev , in agreement with fluorescence emission from iron in the ionization range fe i  fe xvi , which is thought to be distributed into a cold ( @xmath20 k ) accretion disc as well as into a surrounding molecular dusty torus .",
    "since the disc and torus components may contribute differently to the observed properties , the profiles and intensities of the iron lines are expected to be complex , depending also on the inclination with respect to the line of sight .",
    "the properties of the iron line emitted by a cold accretion disc have been calculated in a number of papers ( george & fabian 1991 ; matt et al .",
    "1991 ) . when relativistic effects are considered ( matt et al .",
    "1992 ) , the calculated line profile is broad ( @xmath21 kev ) , asymmetric and double horned , with a doppler boosted blue horn . the line equivalent width is predicted to be at most @xmath22 ev .",
    "broad asymmetric line profiles have been detected by asca in several sey 1 galaxies ( tanaka et al .",
    "1995 ; mushotzky et al .",
    "1995 ; nandra et al .",
    "1997a ) in agreement with relativistic disc models .",
    "ghisellini , haardt & matt ( 1994 ) have performed a quantitative analysis of the fluorescence line emission from a specific torus configuration under the assumption that the disc and the torus are coplanar . in the case of type 1 agn ,",
    "viewed along lines of sight free from obscuration , the iron line emitted by a dense torus ( @xmath23 @xmath4 ) may contribute substantially to the overall line strength ( up to @xmath24 ev ) . on the other hand , since in type 2 agn the radiation from the central source is intercepted by the torus , the equivalent width of the torus iron line may become very large ( up to a few kev ) for tori that are optically thick to compton scattering ( equatorial @xmath25 a few @xmath26 @xmath4 ) .",
    "it is important to note that the iron line emitted by the torus should have roughly a narrow ( @xmath27 kev ) gaussian profile . the iron line equivalent widths and profiles of several sey 2s are in good agreement with the torus picture ( smith & done 1996 ; weaver et al .",
    "very strong iron lines associated to flat reflection continua are found in a dozen of type 2 objects , most likely compton thick agn ( maiolino et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) .    in a few objects ,",
    "mainly sey 2 galaxies , the iron emission is due to a combination of neutral k@xmath15 at 6.4 kev plus lines from highly ionized iron ( fe xxv , fe xxvi ) at 6.68 kev and 6.96 kev ( ueno et al . 1994 ; turner et al .",
    "1997a , b ) .",
    "these lines are thought to be produced in a ` warm mirror ' ( matt , brandt & fabian 1996 ) , which may also be responsible for the scattering of the broad optical lines observed in polarized light in type 2 objects .",
    "the iron lines ( as well as the reflection humps above @xmath28 kev ) are not a common feature of the quasars spectra ( lawson & turner 1997 ) .",
    "iwasawa & taniguchi ( 1993 ) have suggested that an ` x  ray baldwin effect ' may hold , whereby the equivalent width of the lines decreases with increasing luminosity .",
    "this has been confirmed by nandra et al .",
    "( 1997b ) , who also find a change in the line profile with luminosity and propose a model where the accretion disc becomes more ionized as a function of the accretion rate .    in order to estimate the mean properties of the iron line we have collected literature data based on asca and ginga measurements .",

    "the data are the same as given by gendreau et al .",

    "it should be noted that the model does not reproduce the data below @xmath238 kev , because in this spectral region the contribution of sources other than agn is expected ( comastri el al .",
    "clearly , the additional flux provided by the iron line is below present uncertainties in the xrb measurements and the dispersion of the data does not allow yet to detect the predicted iron feature .",
    "it should also be noted that the relatively deep gold edge in the instrumental response at @xmath239 kev , which introduces calibration uncertainties around this energy , is very close to the energy where the maximum deviations due to the iron line are expected",
    ". therefore the narrow bump in the observed xrb spectrum around 2 kev has an instrumental origin and is not produced by the iron line .",
    "the main conclusion of this work is that the predicted contribution of the fluorescence iron lines to the xrb in the 1.5  7 kev energy interval is @xmath240 with a peak intensity @xmath241 at @xmath238 kev .",

    "( 1995 ) , this result should essentially hold for those synthesis models of the xrb that are based on the agn unifications schemes .",
    "this estimated contribution of the iron lines is still undetectable within the dispersion of the best available data .",
    "indeed , the uncertainties in the power law fit of the xrb spectrum observed by asca are of the order of @xmath242 ( gendreau et al .",
    "1995 ) . in order to reproduce an iron excess of more than @xmath242 a mean equivalent width of @xmath243 ev for the sources with @xmath244 @xmath4 should have been adopted , which is inconsistent with the observed average values .    since in our calculations",
    "we have assigned to all sey nuclei an iron line equivalent width of 390 ev , corresponding to the maximum average value quoted in table  2 , and since not all observed nuclei show detectable iron lines , we are confident that our result may represent a rather stringent upper limit to any iron line contribution to the xrb",
    ". therefore , the present undetection of iron features in the xrb spectrum does not constitute by itself an argument against the synthesis of the xrb by known classes of agn . on the contrary",
    ", one may argue that the detection of the iron signature would constitute strong evidence in favour of these models , while putting at the same time severe constraints on other classes of as yet undetected agn which have been recently hypothesized in order to explain the xrb .    in order to observe the predicted iron feature ,",
    "the dispersion in the xrb data should be reduced by at least 50% .",
    "perhaps , this may be achieved in the near future with the forthcoming x  ray missions .",
    "it may be noted that , in principle , from the energy range and profile of the iron feature one could also get relevant information about the values of @xmath245 and @xmath246 characterizing the evolution of agn .",
    "finally , we note that the estimated intensity of the iron feature may partially explain the discrepancy in the normalizations of asca and heao1 a2 data . since the normalization of the xrb from heao1 a2 has been derived from a broad band analysis of the data , one may wonder whether the intensity at the low energy end of the spectrum , where the iron feature is expected , has been somewhat underestimated .",
