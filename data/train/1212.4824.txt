    "the loss term @xmath59 describes the rate of particle losses at the position @xmath60 .",
    "similar master equations for optical lattices with leaky sites have been studied in @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of an operator is then given by the differential equation @xmath61 plugging equation ( 3 ) into ( 7 ) yields after some algebra @xmath62 \\hat{\\psi}(\\mathrm{\\bf x } )    \\right\\rangle - \\frac{i\\hbar\\gamma(\\mathrm { \\bf x})}{2}\\left\\langle \\hat{\\psi}(\\mathrm{\\bf x } ) \\right\\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] performing the usual mean - field approximation @xmath63 we arrive at equation ( 1 ) of the main text , i.e. , to the time - dependent gross - pitaevski equation with imaginary potential ( igpe ) .",
    "the comparison between the experiment and the numerical solution of the igpe suggests that the mean - field approximation is well justified for our parameters .",
    "we experimentally determine the value of @xmath19 by monitoring the short - time decay of the ion signal for a fixed current and different electron beam sizes . indeed analysing the solutions of the igpe we have found that such a decay is approximately exponential with a time constant @xmath64 .",
    "the eb size @xmath21 is derived in two different ways .",
    "we first measure @xmath21 by fitting with an integrated gaussian function the electron signal originating from the scan of the beam through the edge of an auxiliary metallic target .",
    "the position of the beam focus and hence the value of @xmath21 at a fixed point can be easily varied by changing the current in its final focussing stage .",
    "a calibration of the beam size as a function of this current is also used to recover the measured @xmath21 when the working position of the microscope is finely adjusted at the actual location of the atoms . for comparison",
    "we also extract @xmath21 directly using the atomic sample as a target , by measuring the visibility of a two - dimensional deep optical lattice imaged by the eb itself .",
    "the lattice that we employed has a spacing of @xmath65 nm and a depth of @xmath66 .",
    "the beam size @xmath21 is obtained by deconvolving the density distribution of the atoms in the lattice by their expected wannier functions distribution .",
    "note that the eb size does not vary appreciably along the radial extension of the cloud ( @xmath67 @xmath27 m ) , as its rayleigh length is always conveniently larger ( @xmath68 @xmath27 m ) .",
    "the two measurements yield compatible results and are also in accordance with the measurement of @xmath69 as a function of the current @xmath18 performed for two different beam sizes : @xmath70 nm and @xmath71 nm , see fig . s1 . from this analysis",
    "we obtain the value of the electron - bec cross - section used in this work : @xmath72 m@xmath73 .     as a function of the eb current @xmath18 for two different values of the beam size @xmath35 nm ( gray triangles ) and @xmath74 nm ( red circles ) .",
    "the solid lines are linear fits to the data .",
    "the current @xmath18 is measured by means of a faraday cup , which is integrated in the experimental apparatus.,width=321 ]      the main spurious effect is caused by the losses due to the secondary collisions of the produced ions with the trapped atoms .",
    "indeed such ions , produced in the center of the bec , travelling through the atomic cloud can collide with other atoms expelling them from the trap .",
    "this effect can in principle be reduced applying a strong electric field which extracts the ions faster ; but it can not be completely avoided . in order to take into account this loss channel the igpe must be modified adding an ion - atom collision term in the imaginary potential such that : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the ions production rate and @xmath77 is a gaussian function whose amplitude @xmath78 and extension @xmath79 depend on the extraction geometry of the ions .",
    "we have determined these two parameters fitting the time resolved curves like the one in fig .",
    "1b , finding @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "taking into account this effect is important in our case mainly to estimate our ion detection efficiency , that is @xmath82 , but it has no significant impact on the physics presented . in the main text when we compare the theory with data we have included this effect while pure theoretical graphs report the ideal case .",
    "additional spurious effects that , in principle , must be taken into account are related to the real potentials stemming from the eb . indicating with @xmath83 the radial distance from the center of the eb in the direction perpendicular to its propagation , one can find that the eb generates a magnetic field which has the following expression : @xmath84 the electron microscope machine produces itself a background magnetic field @xmath85 of @xmath86 1 g , directed along the direction of propagation of the eb and is always present at the atoms position .",
    "due to this , the total magnetic field acting on the atoms is @xmath87 .",
    "since @xmath88 is on the order of just 1 - 2 mg , it results that @xmath89 , making any effect due to the magnetic field produced by the eb @xmath88 negligible .",
    "we now consider the electric field induced on the atoms by the flux of electrons , which can be approximated by : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the mean velocity of the electrons .",
    "this field leads to an effective potential orientated along the direction perpendicular to the beam propagation @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the ground state polarizability of the @xmath94rb atoms . for the beam maximum current we employed in the present experiments , @xmath95 na , the ratio between the maximum modulus of the dissipative and electric potentials is @xmath96 and this latter contribution is again negligible .",
    "finally , we have also taken into account for the effects of the real potentials of the eb in the numerical simulations finding , as expected , no appreciable correction to the calculations performed without .",
    "the numerical simulations made to reproduce the data for the thermal cloud were performed using a molecular dynamics method . we have used a runge - kutta algorithm to simulate the dynamics of @xmath9710@xmath98 atoms at the temperature of 1 @xmath27k in a harmonic potential . for this simulation",
    "the atoms were supposed to be point - like , neglecting any kind of quantum effect like the finite extension due to the debroglie wavelength .",
    "moreover we did not take into account the interactions between the atoms .",
    "the action of the electron beam was simulated introducing @xmath99 electrons per m@xmath73 , gaussian distributed in space along @xmath100 and @xmath101 , and uniformly distributed along @xmath102 , the direction of propagation of the eb .",
    "@xmath41 is the time step of the simulation .",
    "every time the distance @xmath103 between one atom and one electron is smaller than @xmath104 the atom is supposed to collide with the electron leading to the loss of such an atom from the trap .",
    "we have found that this method , despite its simplicity , reproduces quite well our data except for a multiplicative factor , which takes into account the efficiency of the ion detector and the branching - ratio of the collision processes .",
    "we point out that a big advantage originating from the many - body nature of the bec is the possibility to perform continuous measurements on a single wavefunction , giving direct access to the dynamics without the need of ensemble averages . at the same time",
    "the interactions between the atoms play a crucial role in determining the properties of such a wavefunction , through the non - linear term in the igpe , and have a direct impact on the dissipative dynamics . even if experimentally we are not able to change the interactions we can do it when solving the igpe changing the value of @xmath13 .",
    "the results are reported in fig .",
    "the position of the maximum dissipation is shifted to higher values of @xmath18 as the interactions between the atoms are increased .",
    "the normalization is made to compensate the effect of the changing density ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "clearly increasing interactions hinder the onset and the effects of the dzd.,width=321 ]    as expecting a change in the interaction strength changes the position of the maximum of dissipation , since it depends on @xmath27 : the stronger is the repulsion between the atoms the more the onset of the dzd is shifted to larger values of @xmath18 and the more its effects are decreased .",
    "moreover an increasing in @xmath13 implies a reduced production of ions , for a given @xmath106 , due to the subsequent change in the density . as shown in fig .",
    "s2 , also a non - interacting bec displays the non monotonic behaviour observed in the experiment . from this",
    "we hence conclude that the observed effects originate from the wave nature of the bec and not from its many - body character . nevertheless , according to fig .",
    "s2 , the mean - field potential stemming from the atomic interactions represents another important controllable parameter that can be used to engineer the response of the system to the environmental action ."
