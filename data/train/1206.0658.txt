    "general relativity teaches us space and time are not independent , but inseparably entangled in a unified _ spacetime_. nevertheless , standard procedure in canonical gravity is to temporarily disregard this lesson , foliating spacetime into spacelike level sets of some time function .",
    "this gives an initial value formulation of general relativity @xcite , with many uses in classical and quantum gravity .",
    "but this approach , depending on an arbitrary , unobservable time function , has strange physical consequences . while the spacetime picture of gravity is described by _",
    "equations , the foliation constrains _ global _ spacetime geometry and topology .",
    "a well - posed initial value formulation demands global hyperbolicity , which in turn implies constant spatial topology @xcite .",
    "this leaves many interesting spacetimes , including even anti - de  sitter space , with no ` dynamical ' description . here",
    "we present an alternative , _ fully local _ description of gravitational dynamics , based on the notion of a _ field of observers_. this is useful for a geometric understanding of lorentz symmetry in canonical gravity , for relating geometrodynamics with connection dynamics , for linking canonical and covariant phase spaces , and for various possible extensions of general relativity .",
    "in minkowski space @xmath0 , an observer with velocity @xmath1 in hyperbolic space @xmath2 has a global notion of ` space , ' namely the subspace @xmath3 orthogonal to @xmath1 : @xmath4 an observer thus naturally splits spacetime fields into spatial and temporal parts .    in more general spacetimes ,",
    "this picture is valid only ` infinitesimally , ' on each tangent space .",
    "a * field of observers * is a unit future - directed timelike vector field @xmath5something any time - oriented lorentzian manifold has .",
    "such a field suffices to split fields on a _ background _",
    "spacetime into spatial and temporal parts .",
    "but here we are interested in general relativity , where the metric  and hence the definition of observer  is to be determined by the dynamics",
    ". can we define ` observers ' without using the metric ?",
    "fortunately , the * coframe field * in first - order gravity locally maps spacetime vectors to vectors in @xmath0 , which we view as an * internal spacetime*. this lets us translate between an observer field and a more primitive notion : a field of * internal observers * , assigning an observer @xmath6 to each point @xmath7 of spacetime .",

    "all other differential forms similarly split into a * spatial part * annihilating @xmath5 , and a * temporal part * of the form @xmath15 . in particular , the spin connection is given by @xmath16 where the spatial 1-form @xmath17 and the scalar @xmath18 both live in @xmath19 .",
    "these constructions are clearly analogous to how spacetime fields are built in adm gravity @xcite .    in this language ,",

    "we have already mentioned that doing so avoids making global restrictions other than time - orientability .",
    "more importantly , configurations with @xmath31 are related to foliations by a _",
    "natural symmetry_. lorentz gauge transformations act on internal observers , @xmath32 , but because @xmath33 one can transform either the coframe @xmath34 or the observer field @xmath5 , giving two distinct types of local lorentz symmetry . transforming @xmath5 will in general map a foliation to a configuration where @xmath35 ; invariance under those transformations",
    "is the analog in our framework of independence of foliation in standard hamiltonian approaches .",

    ". one can show @xcite that they generalize ashtekar variables @xcite , in the real form due to barbero @xcite . in the ashtekar - barbero formulation , the apparent breaking of lorentz symmetry down to @xmath49 arises by fixing @xmath1 and therefore the subgroup @xmath47 once and for all .    for us ,",
    "this breaking occurs ` spontaneously ' : at each spacetime point , @xmath50 selects the subgroup @xmath37 . by transforming @xmath1 along with the dynamical variables ,",
    "the action of the full lorentz group is maintained .    breaking @xmath51 symmetry spontaneously has two nice side - effects .",
    "first , it sidesteps second class constraints that must be dealt with in related connection - based approaches .",
    "second , it makes the pair @xmath52 into a ` spatial cartan connection , ' making a precise link between ` geometrodynamics ' and ` connection dynamics . '",

    "since @xmath5 is normalized , this flow is parameterized by _ proper time _ of the observer field :    ( 150,100 ) ( 5,0)(20,20)(10,50)(10,50)(0,80)(10,100 ) ( 130,0)(135,20)(130,50)(130,50)(120,80)(130,100 ) ( 25,0)(1,3)5(50,0)(0,3)14(75,0)(-1,3)5(100,0)(1,3)5 ( 25,25)(0,3)14(50,25)(1,3)5(75,25)(2,3)13(100,25)(2,3)13(125,25)(0,3)15 ( 25,50)(-1,3)5(35,50)(0,1)14(50,50)(2,3)13(75,50)(2,3)13(100,50)(1,3)5 ( 25,75)(1,3)5(50,75)(2,3)13(75,75)(1,3)5(100,75)(2,3)13 ( 30,0)(40,40)(50,50)(50,50)(55,58)(67,72)(67,72)(70,74)(80,100 ) ( 52,0)(55,30)(72,50)(72,50)(80,60)(95,75)(95,75)(100,81)(108,100 ) ( 85,0)(90,25)(105,50)(105,50)(118,70)(125,100 )    thus , while we have no global notion of space , there is a canonical way to push the _ whole spacetime _",
    "forward by one second of proper time of the observers .",
    "but how do we define _ phase space _ without a foliation ?",
    "the * covariant phase space * of general relativity is its space of solutions , a natural covariant generalization of the ` canonical ' phase space @xcite .",
    "however , not dividing spacetime into space and time , it lacks any obvious link to the conceptual picture of spatial configurations changing in time .",
    "the observer - based formulation could provide this link .",
    "on one hand , if we choose an observer field corresponding to a foliation , we recover canonical gravity . on the other , everything transforms covariantly under change of observer , a local gauge choice .",
    "adjoining the observer field @xmath1 gives us a covariant phase space in which spatial and temporal variables are clearly distinguished , without spoiling local lorentz symmetry .",
    "in general relativity , just as there is no canonical spacelike foliation , there is no canonical choice of observer .",
    "faced with such a situation , rather than making an arbitrary choice , one can _ simultaneously consider all possible choices .",
    "_ individual choices are arbitrary ; the _ space _ of choices is canonical .      on the other hand , * observer space * , the space of all possible observers , has manifest physical meaning , and simple topology : it is a 7-dimensional manifold isomorphic to the ` unit future tangent bundle ' of spacetime , locally a product of spacetime with velocity space @xmath2 . in @xcite",
    "we reformulate general relativity directly on observer space , essentially by pulling fields back along the natural projection @xmath58 a connection pulled back to observer space will be flat in the ` velocity ' directions , reflecting the symmetry under changes of observer .",
    "general relativity respects this symmetry , but does _ nature _ ? as we and all our instruments are ` observers , ' we can not probe spacetime geometry directly in any observer - independent way .",
    "the empirical evidence for symmetry under a change of observer could be challenged by future observations .",
    "several modifications of general relativity currently of interest can be studied using observer space .",
    "first , there is a growing interest in models that do not treat spacetime isotropically @xcite . since points in observer space",
    "correspond to directions in spacetime , these anisotropic theories might be described very naturally in these terms .",
    "perhaps more compelling is the question of whether spacetime itself plays any fundamental role in physics .",
    "once we have lifted the theory to observer space , do we still have any need for spacetime ?",
    "in fact , starting with observer space , we can _",
    "reconstruct spacetime_but only when certain ` integrability conditions ' hold @xcite .",
    "the ` relative locality ' proposal @xcite suggests the notion of spacetime itself may be _ observer - dependent_. observer space provides a natural perspective from which to study this possibility , with the potential to move beyond ` special ' and on to ` general ' relative locality .",
