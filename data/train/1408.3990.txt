    "most of the algebraic theory is based on @xmath10 and its central extension @xmath11 which is closely related to affine kac - moody lie algebras .",

    "a standard reference about the loop group is pressley - segal s book @xcite .",
    "searching for similar mapping groups in higher dimensions , etingof and frenkel @xcite came up with the group @xmath13 for a compact connected riemann surface @xmath2 , and studied its central extensions , its automorphisms and coadjoint orbits .",
    "it turns out that the universal central extension has infinite dimensional center , but there is an interesting sub - extension by the jacobian of @xmath2 .",
    "the orbits of the coadjoint representation for 1-connected @xmath0 correspond bijectively to equivalence classes of holomorphic principal @xmath0-bundles over the surface @xmath2 .",
    "these bundles carry by construction a flat connection .    on the other hand ,",
    "more classes of examples arise from mapping spaces with different regularity conditions . one important class of examples are spaces of meromorphic maps . here",

    "krichever - novikov @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for the genus zero case and schlichenmaier , schlichenmaier - sheinman ( see @xcite ) for arbitrary genus define meromorphic analogues of the loop algebras as @xmath16 for any complex lie algebra @xmath9 , where @xmath17 is the algebra of regular functions on the algebraic variety @xmath5 .",

    "a new result is the lifting of the lie group structure to the central extension ( corollary 2.13 ) .    in section 3 ,",

    "concrete results are the computation of the automorphism group ( corollary [ aut(g ) ] ) .",

    "here we study the coadjoint orbits of @xmath4 in the smooth dual of @xmath19 and establish relations to flat principal @xmath0-bundels on @xmath5 as well as to the coadjoint orbits of the loop group @xmath20 ( propositions 4.3 and 4.8 ) .",
    "section 1 prepares the necessary material about flat bundles . as usual",
