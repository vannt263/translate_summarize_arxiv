    "<S> the electrical conductivity of metallic carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) quickly saturates with respect to bias voltage due to scattering from a large population of optical phonons </S>",
    "<S> . decay of these dominant scatterers in pristine cnts is too slow to offset an increased generation rate at high voltage bias . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate from first principles that encapsulation of 1d atomic chains within a single - walled cnt can enhance decay of `` hot '' phonons by providing additional channels for thermalisation . </S>",
    "<S> pacification of the phonon population growth reduces electrical resistivity of metallic cnts by 34% for an example system with encapsulated beryllium .    </S>",
    "<S> carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) are the most promising candidates for nanoelectronic conductors due to their excellent electrical conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however experimental and theoretical studies show that electronic transport in metallic cnts undergoes a dramatic decrease beyond a bias of @xmath0ev due to scattering of conduction electrons from a population of high frequency phonons @xcite . under bias voltage , </S>",
    "<S> the process of electron scattering excites new phonons into this population an order of magnitude faster than their decay via thermalisation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this dominance of excitation over deexcitation results in a growing population of athermal `` hot '' phonons and consequently a non - equilibrium phonon distribution @xcite . under such conditions , </S>",
    "<S> these hot phonons constitute the dominant source of electron scattering , and hence resistivity , in metallic cnts . </S>",
    "<S> a mechanism for increasing the rate of phonon thermalisation will therefore enhance the electrical performance of cnts .    </S>",
    "<S> the process of phonon deexcitation involves anharmonic phonon - phonon scattering , hence its rate is dependent on the number of available channels for phonon decay . </S>",
    "<S> previously , several possible solutions for introduction of additional thermalisation channels were suggested that considered a supporting substrate or isotopic disorder @xcite . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we show that reduction of the hot phonon population under bias is readily achievable via encapsulation of 1d nanowires in single - walled cnts ( swcnt ) . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that an encapsulated one - dimensional crystal creates additional channels for hot phonon thermalisation , increasing the decay rate . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a significant improvement of the voltage - current ratio at high bias voltage . </S>",
    "<S> transport is studied by solving the set of boltzmann transport equations ( bte ) for coupled dynamics of electrons and phonons , whilst all relevant scattering rates are calculated _ ab initio _ with density - functional perturbational theory ( dfpt ) . </S>",
    "<S> this route to enhanced transport is attractive due to increasingly well - established methods for growth of 1d crystals inside cnts @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a broad variety of materials have been encapsulated in this manner , allowing for different degrees of phonon - phonon coupling with the encapsulating cnts . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , modern experimental techniques of raman @xcite and ultrafast optical spectroscopy @xcite allow for detailed investigation of how the hot phonon distribution evolves in these novel materials .    </S>",
    "<S> the competing scattering processes that determine the electrical performance of a material are illustrated in fig.[fig : schematic ] . in metallic cnts </S>",
    "<S> , it has been established that conduction electrons scatter mainly with optical phonons , corresponding to modes at the @xmath1 and @xmath2 points of the graphene brillouin zone ( bz ) @xcite .     and @xmath3 respectively.,width=226 ]    </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding electron - phonon scattering times @xmath4ps have been previously derived based on dfpt calculations of graphene , and a simple analytical formula accounting for the finite diameter of cnts @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the population of excited phonons grows rapidly in the non - equilibrium regime for voltages higher than @xmath5v because thermalisation due to the anharmonic phonon - phonon scattering is significantly slower - from @xmath6ps for @xmath7 to @xmath8ps for @xmath9 @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic lifetimes can be evaluated using fermi s golden rule @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the electron - phonon scattering rate , when only phonon emission is considered ( backward scattering ) can be expressed as the following : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the matrix element of electron - phonon interaction between a phonon with mode index @xmath12 , momentum @xmath13 and frequency @xmath14 , and electrons in states @xmath15 . @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the distribution functions of electrons and phonons respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix element @xmath11 is the inner product of electron states and the variation of the electron self - consistent potential with respect to the atomic disturbance due to phonon propagation that we calculate _ ab initio _ with dfpt @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a periodic system consisting of a metallic single - walled cnt(6,6 ) ( swcnt ) encapsulating a 1d chain of be - be@cnt(6,6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that although most materials might be expected to form 1d atomic chains in confinement at small diameters @xcite , more complex structures become energetically favourable in swcnts with diameters larger than @xmath18 @xmath19@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we choose be for this proof - of - concept study as it possesses a bulk lattice parameter commensurate with armchair cnts , suggesting that effects of artificial mismatch strain will be small . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , phonon lifetimes as well as transport properties of low dimensional carbon materials can change under strain @xcite , however the viability of the decay mechanism demonstrated in the following is not critically sensitive to such details .    </S>",
    "<S> phonon dispersion of this combined be@cnt system , excitation of the phonon modes due to the electron - phonon coupling and the corresponding linewidths @xmath20 are presented on the fig [ fig : dispersion ] . in agreement with previous calculations @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the electron - phonon coupling is most pronounced for optical modes at the points corresponding to @xmath1 and @xmath2 of graphene bz . </S>",
    "<S> this does not change significantly upon be encapsulation .    for the purposes of computing scattering parameters for use within the bte , </S>",
    "<S> coupling was considered for all bands and no values of the considered grid were neglected during integration of the bz @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the excited phonon in a mode @xmath12 with momentum @xmath21 decays into a pair of phonons with opposite momenta , @xmath22 with a rate that can be expressed by the following @xmath23 the third derivative of the total energy with respect to the atomic displacements , @xmath24 , as well as the corresponding phonon frequencies @xmath25 can be obtained from dfpt @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism of the phonon thermalisation is based on decay into lower energy modes . </S>",
    "<S> thus , by providing additional channels of deexcitation , in our case , phonon modes of an encapsulated nanowire , one can decrease thermalisation time and reduce the hot phonon population . </S>",
    "<S> most channels available for decay are not coupled directly with conduction electrons and therefore do not participate in electrons backscattering . by extension </S>",
    "<S> , these do not affect electronic transport . </S>",
    "<S> two of these channels are indicated on the fig [ fig : dispersion ] . </S>",
    "<S> frequencies of the marked channels satisfy the summation rule in three - phonon scattering , while conserving energy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> provided that summation rule holds as enforced by @xmath26-function in ( [ phph ] ) every atom of the encapsulated nanowire creates three additional vibrational modes with a scattering time @xmath27 and increases the thermalisation rate as @xmath28 .    to evaluate the effect of the reduction in thermalisation time due to be encapsulation on the high - bias electronic transport in cnts , we employ the bte , which involves scattering rates explicitly . </S>",
    "<S> in this manner the study combines first principles calculations and model kinetic treatment of electronic transport . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasise that no other approximations except those inherent to the dfpt and bte approaches were employed . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the all - bands relaxation time approximation for the scattering process , via the calculated characteristic linewidth of each band . </S>",
    "<S> the initial distribution of electrons is considered equilibrium @xmath29 and evolves according to the following : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is electron velocity of a band @xmath32 at a point @xmath33 in the bz , and @xmath34 is an applied voltage . </S>",
    "<S> electric field @xmath35 is initially uniform along the cnt length @xmath36 and changes according to the poisson equation as charge flows . </S>",
    "<S> scattering rates due to the electron - phonon coupling are calculated according to ( [ elph ] ) and depend on phonon population . </S>",
    "<S> the latter evolves from equilibrium @xmath37 during electronic transport as more phonons are excited with increase of voltage bias , while only a fraction of them can be thermalised due to phonon - phonon scattering along the cnt . in order to describe evolution of the phonon distribution </S>",
    "<S> we consider the corresponding bte : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a phonon velocity in a band @xmath12 , a collision term describes interplay between excitation and thermalisation of phonons . </S>",
    "<S> the set of equations ( [ a]),([b ] ) is solved consistently by numerical integration in time@xcite , where all the parameters of the equations are obtained _ ab initio _ by means of density - functional theory and dfpt as above . </S>",
    "<S> the present approach has similar philosophy with that in ref.@xcite with several differences in analytical and technical implementation . </S>",
    "<S> first , scattering rates are considered explicitly for all bands that evolve due to the change of phonon population . </S>",
    "<S> second , the phonon distribution evolves starting from a room temperature equilibrium distribution rather than zero population . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , a second order upwind discretisation scheme @xcite is elaborated that makes evolution of distribution functions dependent on electron and phonon velocities for every band @xmath12 and wave vector @xmath40 @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> curves for swcnt(6,6 ) and swcnt(6,6 ) with encapsulated 1d be nanowire , @xmath41 nm , @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> the top dark blue line corresponds to a zero phonon population and thus , no electron - phonon scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the second blue line is obtained for cnts with electron - phonon scattering , when phonon distribution does not evolve in time and remains equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> the bottom and top red lines correspond to swcnt(6,6 ) and be@cnt(6,6 ) respectively with the electron - phonon scattering and anharmonic phonon - phonon scattering taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the black line represents experimental values from @xcite.,width=340 ]    the significance of effect of electron - phonon and phonon - phonon scattering on electronic transport in cnt can be understood from fig.[fig : ivcurve ] . when phonon population is neglected @xmath43 </S>",
    "<S> , electric current shows ballistic behaviour , with continuous quasi - linear growth with voltage increase ( not shown on the fig.[fig : ivcurve ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that electron - phonon scattering with a static phonon population has a major impact on the resistivity of cnts , causing electric current saturation . </S>",
    "<S> however , optimal agreement with experiment is achieved when the phonon population is allowed to evolve away from equilibrium during the electron flow . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , accumulation of athermal optical phonons contributes to further saturation of electric current . </S>",
    "<S> bader population analysis @xcite demonstrates no charge transfer between be nanowire and swcnts upon encapsulation , thus there is no increase of the number of carriers in the composite system . the electronic band structure of be@cnt(6,6 ) as well as velocities of electrons </S>",
    "<S> do not differ considerably from those of a pristine swcnt . </S>",
    "<S> moreover calculations on an isolated 1d chain of be atoms demonstrate that the wire itself does not conduct electrons @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . nevertheless the presence of a be nanowire encapsulated within the cnt pacifies the growth in hot phonons population and results in a reduction of electrical resistivity of swcnts in room temperature by 34% for a threshold voltage of 0.2v and by 15% for 1v bias .    </S>",
    "<S> the considered model kinetic behaviour is justified for the systems , where electronic scattering by lattice vibrations is dominant in the whole range of temperatures as no scattering with impurities is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption allows us both to consider temperature effects in terms of distribution functions only , and also to employ the zero temperature scattering probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> description of elastic scattering with defects or temperature dependence of the coupling constants would require an approach beyond the relaxation time approximation that would consider such effects of many - phonon scattering as second sound @xcite .    in conclusion , we confirm that generation of hot phonons saturates electric current in metallic cnts under high - voltage bias . we demonstrate that encapsulation of be atomic chains within a swcnt mitigates this effect . from first principles </S>",
    "<S> it is calculated that encapsulated be nanowire reduces thermalisation time of excited optical phonons . </S>",
    "<S> the occupation of optical phonons and its evolution is experimentally accessible by ultrafast optical and raman spectroscopy and its time - resolved modification@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is established that electrical conductivity of metallic swcnt is in great part determined by the strength of electron - phonon coupling . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that the later depends effectively on electron and phonon distributions that in general have strong temperature dependence @xcite . a _ </S>",
    "<S> thermally _ conductive encapsulated nanowire can play the role of a heat sink that moderates increase of temperature during electronic transport . </S>",
    "<S> the degree to which an encapsulated atomic chain affects electrical resistivity also depends on the phonon dispersion characteristic of a particular nanowire , i.e. on the number of modes that satisfy conservation of energy and phonon selection rules during decay @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we can expect that the appropriate choice of material , for encapsulation as well as the relevant structure of the nanowire , could lead to a more pronounced effect of boosting the electronic transport in swcnts in wide range of voltage bias . </S>"
