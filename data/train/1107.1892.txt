    "one of the most mysterious discoveries of modern cosmology is related to late time acceleration of universe @xcite . for past one decade or so",
    ", extensive efforts have been made to understand the underlying reason of this phenomenon ( for a recent review see @xcite ) . according to the standard lore ,",
    "the acceleration is caused by an exotic form of matter with large negative pressure called dark energy .",
    "the cosmological constant and a variety of scalar field systems as representative of dark energy are consistent with observations . though some of the scalar field systems with generic features , such as tracker solutions , are attractive but nevertheless they do not address the conceptual problems associated with cosmological constant .",
    "there exist an alternative thinking which advocates the need for a paradigm shift , namely , that gravity is modified at large scales which might give rise to late time acceleration @xcite . we know that gravity is modified at small scales and thus it is quite plausible that modification also cures at large distance where it has not been varied directly . as for the small scale corrections , no deviations from einstein s theory have been yet detected ; perhaps we need to probe still higher energies to observe these effects .",
    "however , situation is quite different challenging at large scales .",
    "indeed , einstein s theory is consistent with observations to a high accuracy at solar scales thereby telling us that any modification to gravity should be confronted with tough constraints posed by solar physics .",
    "secondly , as for the late time acceleration , the modification should also be distinguished from cosmological constant .",
    "the aforementioned requirements are difficult to satisfy consistently in f(r ) theories of gravity .",
    "these theories are equivalent to gr plus a scalar degree of freedom whose potential is uniquely constructed from space time curvature @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the scalar degree of freedom should mimic quintessence and should hide its detection at small scales _  la chameleon _ @xcite .",
    "the investigations show that the generic @xmath3 models either reduce to gr plus cosmological constant @xcite or has a @xmath4mde instead of a standard matter epoch @xcite or hit curvature singularity @xcite or give rise an ugly fine tuning @xcite which is the price one has to pay for implementing the chameleon mechanism .",
    "one might try to remedy these theories by complementing them by quadratic curvature corrections @xcite .",
    "however , as demonstrated by lam hui et al @xcite , theories based upon chameleon mechanism lead to a violation of equivalence principal of the order of one .    in view of the aforesaid",
    ", we need to look for an alternative mechanism of mass screening .",
    "the vainshtein mechanism @xcite is the one which gives rise to mass screening : any modification of gravity in the neighborhood of a massive body within a radius dubbed vainshtein radius are switched off kinematically .",
    "the mechanism was invented to address the discontinuity problem @xcite of massive gravity _",
    " la _ pauli - fierz @xcite .",
    "in this theory , the zero helicity graviton mode @xmath4 is coupled to the stress of energy momentum tensor gives rise to serious violations of local gravity constraints in the limit of vanishing mass of graviton .",
    "vainshtein pointed out that non - linear effects become crucial in this case .",
    "the non - linear derivative term added to pauli - fierz lagrangian was shown to implement the mass screening thereby removing the problem of discontinuity .",
    "it is interesting to note that the non - linear term naturally arises in dgp model @xcite in the decoupling limit @xcite such that vainshtein mechanism is in built in the theory .",
    "the scalar degree of freedom obeys galilean symmetry in flat space time and is free from ghosts is called _ galileon _ @xcite .",
    "there exist higher order galileon lagrangians in flat and curved space - time @xcite .",
    "the higher order lagrangian are necessary for realizing the late time de - siter solution @xcite .",
    "the galileon model appears as a particluar case of the horndeski action defined in 1974 @xcite .",
    "the action has gained some new attention this year , see @xcite for more details .",
    "we should also mention that galileons are deeply related to massive gravity @xcite and dirac - born - infeld systems @xcite in the framework of higher dimensional theories @xcite .",
    "the spherically symmetric solution is studied in @xcite .    in this paper , we consider dimensional reduction of gauss - bonnet gravity @xcite and look for the possibility of mass screening in the model .",
    "we also investigate causal structure of flat spherically symmetric and homogeneous and isotropic backgrounds .",
    "we shall consider the following action in @xmath5 dimensions ,    = ( r+r_gb )    which is the simplest non trivial form of lovelock theory .",
    "+ in order to simplify the analysis , we use the metric anzatz ,    ds^2=g_dx^dx^+e^_ijdx^idx^j    where the greek letters run form @xmath6 to @xmath7 and the latin characters from @xmath8 to @xmath9 . the scalar field @xmath10 appearing in the metric plays the role of the size of the extra dimensions and depends on the first @xmath8 coordinates .",
    "it acquires a non trivial character in case the volume of the compactified dimensions becomes a variable .",
    "following a standard prescription for dimensional reduction on a compact flat space , we get    @xmath11\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath12    it should be noticed that the reduced action does not depend on @xmath8-coefficients . +",

    "in order to investigate the effects of the non linear terms in the action , we shall study the model in a flat spherically symmetric background .",
    "+ in this case , the theory reduces to a special case of kgb @xcite coupled to matter ,    = + _ m[e^-g_;_m ]    with    @xmath23    and the special case of @xmath24 gives rise to k - essence .",

    "for dimensions larger than @xmath43 , the evolution of the fifth force versus the radial coordinate is the same as in case of @xmath40 .",

    "+ it was shown in @xcite that we have extremely tight bounds on the parameters of the model , but as we saw , if we consider the full - action without any approximation on the non - linear terms , we have a vainshtein mechanism which allows the coupling @xmath50 to take large values .",
    "we consider the test field approximation where we expand the field @xmath51 and neglecting the back reaction on the metric .",

    "this equation is lorentzian with a signature ( -,+,+,+ ) , if we have @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "these conditions are exactly the same as the ghost free condition and the stability of the laplacian used in the literature .",
    "+ in fact the equation ( [ effective2 ] ) can be derived from the action    ^2 s =- g^00_^4 x    where    @xmath58    the ghost condition fixes the sign of @xmath55 and @xmath56 and @xmath57 via the positivity of the sound speed @xmath59 , @xmath60 ( also know as the stability of the laplacian ) .",
    "+ when the non linear terms ( @xmath50-terms ) are dominant , we can reduce the evolution equation for the scalar field to    @xmath61    thus it becomes easy to estimate the sound speed at small distances ,    @xmath62    the propagation of the perturbation of the scalar field is therefore superluminal in the radial direction @xmath63 at small distances .",
    "however , we shall demonstrate in the next section for the special case @xmath24 that the superluminal does not implies a non causal propagation of the perturbations .",
    "it is in fact just a redefinition of the maximum sound speed via a larger light cone structure of the space time compared to the minkowsky space .",
    "in the particular case of @xmath24 where an emergent geometry is present ( see @xcite for more details ) , we have    c_r^2=    hence as soon as the non linear @xmath64 term becomes dominant , we have @xmath65 .    , ( bottom ) : the same figure for @xmath24,title=\"fig : \" ] , ( bottom ) : the same figure for @xmath24,title=\"fig : \" ]    ]    the non linear terms which are necessary for local constraints create automatically a superluminal propagation .",
    "this behavior is present in models involving galileons and their extensions @xcite .",
    "we should , however , emphasize that we do not have this propagation in the mikowski space - time but in an extended structure of space - time because of the non linear terms .",

    "it is also interesting to note that the mass term is null when @xmath71 .",
    "therefore the emergent geometry defined by the metric @xmath67 defines a new structure of the space - time , the light cone is larger than the standard one if and only if @xmath72 . in the limit where the non linear terms are dominant , we have @xmath73 .    we emphasize also that this new structure of the spacetime is stably causal .",
    "in fact the minkowski time could define a future directed timelike vector field ,    ^__t_t=-    which is negative as soon as the hyperbolicity conditions are satisfied .",
    "+ therefore no cccs ( causal closed curves ) can exist .    the superluminal propagation does not create any causal inconsistencies .",
    "in fact the perturbations of the scalar field do not propagate in the minkowski space - time but rather in some form of `` aether '' because of the presence of the background field @xmath1 .",
    "the maximum of the speed of the field is just a redefinition of the speed of light in this new space - time .",
