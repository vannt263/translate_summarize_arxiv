    "understanding interface kinetics in materials is an important theoretical and practical problem , since this process influences the microstructure , such as the grain size , the texture , and the interface type . from the theoretical point of view",

    "in particular , dislocations @xcite and grain boundaries @xcite provide a concrete example of driven elastic manifolds in random media @xcite .",
    "other example of this general problem are domain walls in ferromagnets @xcite , flux line in type ii superconductors @xcite , contact lines @xcite and crack fronts @xcite . from the point of view of applications , understanding grain boundary kinetics has a great importance for polycrystalline materials , since the resulting grain microstructure determines material properties such as strength , hardness , resistance to corrosion , conductivity etc . @xcite .",
    "hence the ambitious goal of these studies is to be able to control the microstructural properties of polycrystals .",
    "several approaches have been employed in the literature to study grain boundary kinetics .",
    "@xcite employs molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations with appropriate interatomic interactions to study the diffusion of grain boundaries at the atomic scale @xcite .",
    "the method allows to quantify the mobility of grain boundaries and to compare the results with experiments @xcite .",
    "while md simulations provide a very accurate description of the dynamics , the method suffers from numerical limitations and it is difficult to reach the asymptotic regime .",
    "an alternative method is provided by the langevin approach in which the grain boundary is assumed to evolve stochastically in an external potential @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the underlying crystalline medium enters in the problem only through the noise term ( due to lattice vibrations ) and the periodic potential ( peierls - nabarro ) .",
    "hence , the equations of motion of the atoms or molecules are not directly relevant .",
    "indeed there is experimental evidence in supporting of separation of time scales in plastic flow @xcite and it is thus possible to integrate out the fast degrees of freedom ( atomic vibrations ) and consider only the slow ones ( dislocations position ) .",
    "here we study the evolution of a grain boundary ( gb ) in a crystalline material by the langevin approach .",
    "the gb is treated as an array of interacting dislocations performing a thermally activated motion in a periodic ( peierls - nabarro ) potential .",
    "similar models have been employed in the past to study the conductivity of superionic conductors @xcite , the relaxational dynamics of rotators @xcite and josephson tunneling junctions @xcite .",
    "notice that the crucial role played by long - range stresses is often disregarded in analyzing gb deformation . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that a surface tension approximation for the gb stiffness is inappropriate and one has to consider explicitly non - local interactions .",
    "the present model incorporates this effect in the equations of motion .",
    "we simulate the set of langevin equations numerically to describe the gb kinetics and its fluctuations .",
    "the results are in good agreement with md simulations @xcite and allow to clarify the origin of the short time deviations from the diffusive behavior observed in ref .",
    "in addition , a linearized version of the model can be treated analytically and the asymptotic results are found in good agreement with the simulations .",

    "iv presents numerical simulations of the full flexible gb problems and sec .",
    "v discusses the continuum theory .",
    "vi is devoted to conclusions .",
    "to study the gb dynamics we consider a phenomenological mesoscopic approach .",
    "we consider in particular the case of a regularly spaced low - angle grain boundary schematized as an array of straight dislocations that interact with each other through long - range stress fields and with the crystalline peierls - nabarro ( pn ) potential .",
    "the gb is composed by @xmath0 dislocations where configurations are repeated _ ad infinitum _ because of periodic boundary conditions along the @xmath1 direction . each dislocation has burger vector of modulus @xmath2 parallel to the @xmath3 axis and the distance between two adjacent dislocations along the @xmath1 direction is fixed to be @xmath4 .",
    "each straight dislocation interacts with the lattice and with others dislocations through long - range stress fields .",
