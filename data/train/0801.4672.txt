    "interaction energy @xmath3 drives a quantum phase transition  @xcite from a kinetic energy dominated superfluid ( sf ) phase to an interaction dominated mott insulating ( mi ) phase . the bose hubbard model ( bhm ) captures the essential physics of this problem  @xcite , provided the interactions between the bosons are smaller than interband energies and the problem can be treated in the single band approximation . while the bhm was proposed much before optical lattice experiments became available , a direct experimental realization was missing . in condensed matter systems , josephson junction arrays  @xcite , @xmath4he in vycor and aerogels  @xcite , vortices in superconductors",

    "one of the main advantages of the cold atom systems is that they are clean and much more tunable : the density of bosons , their effective interaction , the tunneling amplitude between the wells , the number of lattice sites , the shape of the trapping potential and aspect ratios can all be varied rather easily , making it possible to study the effects of inhomogeneity and dimensionality . in addition , it is possible to add random potentials to study the effects of disorder .",
    "this sets the optical lattice systems apart as a useful testing ground for theoretical ideas in the area of strongly interacting bosons and fermions .",
