    "in this review , we will assume that _ fundamental scalar fields _ exist in nature , that  in the early stages of the universe  they would have formed absolutely stable soliton - type configurations kept together by their self - generated gravitational field .",
    "theoretically , such configurations are known as _ boson stars _ ( bss ) .",
    "in some characteristics , they resemble neutron stars ; in other aspects , they are different and , thereby , astronomers may have a chance to distinguish bs signals from other compact objects , like neutron stars or black holes ( bhs ) .",
    "bss can be regarded as descendants of self - gravitating photonic configurations called _ geons _ ( gravitational electromagnetic units ) and proposed in 1955 by wheeler @xcite .    in this review",
    ", we shall mainly concentrate on the results which are not included in the first reviews from 1992 @xcite as well as later in the marcel grossman meetings in jerusalem and rome @xcite .",
    "since then , the number of publications investigating how bss could possibly be detected have increased ; we intend to focus strongly on these more recent research results",
    ". this could provide astronomers a handling on possible signals of bss .",
    "all of these theoretical results are only a humble beginning of the understanding where and in which scenarios a bs could be detected .",
    "we hope other researchers may find this review stimulating for gaining new ideas or for refining older research .",
    "a second intention of this review is to distinguish clearly the different theoretical models underlying the label bs which could lead to different observational consequences .",
    "the first distinction is that the matter part of a bs can be described by either a complex or by a real scalar field .",
    "then , there can be different interactions : ( a ) self - interactions described by scalar field potentials , ( b ) minimal coupling to gauge fields , the scalar field can be carrier of a charge ( electric or hypercharge , e.g. ) .",
    "moreover , the bs scalar field can couple , in standard general relativity ( gr ) , minimally , or , in scalar - tensor ( st ) or jordan - brans - dicke ( jbd ) theory , non - minimally to gravity . in the latter case , if the strength of gravitational force is influenced by the jbd scalar field , there is an interaction of the bs scalar field with the real jbd scalar field ; this can lead to _ gravitational memory _",
    "effects in bss .",
    "jbd theory is closely related to low energy limits of superstring theories @xcite which imply the primordial production of scalar fields .",
    "then , relics like the dilaton , the axion , combined as _",
    "axidilaton _ , or other moduli fields could remain in our present epoch as candidates .",
    "already the first two papers on bss provided the two main directions : the history of these _ hypothetical _ stars starts in 1968 with the work of kaup @xcite using a complex massive scalar field with gravitational interactions in a semi - classical manner .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is calculated classically providing the source for gravitation ; a very detailed investigation of the solution classes was done in @xcite . however , one year later , ruffini and bonazzola @xcite used field quantisation of a real scalar field and considered the ground state of @xmath0 particles .",
    "the vacuum expectation value of the field operators yield the same energy - momentum tensor and thus , not surprisingly , the same field equations .",
    "the two different physical constituents , complex versus quantised real scalar field bs , yield the same macroscopical results",
    ". it should be noted , however , that the gravitational field @xmath1 is kept _",
    "classical _ due to the non - renormalisability of standard gr , or , alternatively , treated it as principal low energy part of some renormalisable superstring model .",
    "more recently , a bs using a field quantised complex scalar field has been constructed .",
    "bss consisting of pure semi - classical real scalars can not exist because their static solutions in flat spacetime are unstable due to derrick s theorem @xcite , solutions may arise only if the real scalar field possesses a time - dependence leading to non - static _ oscillating _ bss . however , if a fermion star is present as well , a real scalar component can be added and if it interacts with the fermions , then a combined boson - fermion star is the result as in the first calculation by t.d .",
    "lee and pang @xcite ; cf .  section [ leepang ] .",
    "a challenge for the bs model is that , so far , no _ fundamental _ scalar particle has been detected with certainty in the laboratory .",
    "several are proposed by theory : the higgs particle @xmath2 is a necessary ingredient of the standard model .",
    "however , the possible discovery of the higgs boson of mass @xmath3 gev/@xmath4 at the large electron positron ( lep ) collider at cern @xcite gives the bs strand of investigation a fresh impetus .",
    "for the bs , we need a scalar particle which does not decay ; or if it decays ( like the higgs , e.g. ) , one has to assume that , in the gravitational binding , the inverse process is efficient enough for an equilibrium , as is the case for the @xmath5-decay inside a neutron star . in the latter case ,",
    "the direct physical predecessor of that kind of a bs is not clear ; but , of course , unstable higgs particles could not have formed a bs by themselves . in order to explore that unknown particle regime , one can play with the model parameters such as particle mass or interaction constants . then , bss of rather different sizes can occur : it could be just a ` gravitational atom ' ; it could be as massive as the presumed bh in the central part of a galaxy ; or it could be an alternative explanation for parts of the dark matter in the halo of galaxies .    in 1995 ,",
    "experiments @xcite proved the existence of the fifth possible state of matter , the _ bose - einstein condensate _ ( bec ) ; in 2001 , the nobel prize was awarded for its experimental realization in traps .",
    "bss , if they exist , would be an astrophysical realization with a self - generated gravitational confinement , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us sum up some of the properties of complex scalar field bss ( following an earlier version of @xcite ) in table i as we shall discuss in section iii .",
    "@xmath6      the physical nature of the spin-0-particles out of which the bs is presumed to consist , is still an open issue .",
    "until now , no fundamental elementary scalar particle has been detected with certainty in accelerator experiments , which could serve as the main constituent of the bs . in the theory of glashow , weinberg , and salam , a higgs boson doublet @xmath7 and its anti - doublet @xmath8 are necessary ingredients in order to generate masses for the ` heavy photons ' , i.e.  the @xmath9 and @xmath10 gauge vector bosons @xcite .",
    "after symmetry breaking , only one real scalar particle , the higgs particle @xmath11 , remains free and occurs in the state of a constant scalar field background @xcite .",
    "as it is indicated by the rather heavy top quark @xcite of 176 gev/@xmath4 , the mass of the higgs particle is expected to be below 1000 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "this is supported by the possible discovery of the higgs boson of mass @xmath3 gev/@xmath4 at the large electron positron ( lep ) collider at cern @xcite . in order to stabilise such a light higgs against quantum fluctuations , a _",
    "extension of the standard model is desirable .",
    "however , then it will be accompanied by additional heavy higgs fields @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and a charged doublet @xmath14 in the mass range of 100 gev/@xmath4 to 1 tev/@xmath4 . for the unlike case of a higgs mass @xmath15 above 1.2 tev/@xmath4 , the self - interaction @xmath16 of the higgs field is so large that any perturbative approach of the standard model becomes unreliable .",
    "tentatively , a conformal extension of the standard model with gravity included has been analysed , cf .",
    "future high - energy experiments at the lhc at cern should reveal if higgs particles really exist in nature .    as free particles ,",
    "the higgs boson of glashow - weinberg - salam theory is unstable , e.g.  with respect to the decays @xmath17 and @xmath18 , if it is heavier than the gauge bosons . in a compact object like the bs",
    ", these decay channels are expected to be in partial equilibrium with the inverse processes @xmath19 or , via virtual @xmath20 triangle graph , @xmath21 , for instance @xcite , by utilising gravitational binding energy .",
    "this is presumably in full analogy with the neutron star @xcite or quark star @xcite , where one finds an equilibrium of @xmath22- and inverse @xmath22-decay or of a quark - gluon plasma ( with similar decay and inverse - decay processes ) and thus stability of the macroscopic star with respect to radioactive decay .    the known spin-0-particles in particle physics ,",
    "although effectively described by a klein - gordon ( kg ) equation , are not elementary , they consist of quarks having spin 1/2 .",
    "nevertheless , they possess some physical properties which can help us to understand which kind of particles can occur in the different bs types .",
    "the electrically charged pions @xmath23 with a mass of about 140 mev/@xmath4 are a typical example for complex scalar fields @xcite .",
    "the electrically neutral @xmath24 , @xmath25 mesons are described by a complex kg field as well ; @xmath24 and @xmath25 are distinguished by their hypercharge @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the baryon number and @xmath28 is the strangeness corresponding to a global @xmath29 symmetry . in both cases , particles ( e.g.  @xmath30 , @xmath24 ) and anti - particles",
    "( e.g.  @xmath31 , @xmath25 ) occur .",
    "generally , noether s theorem leads to a conserved charge q = e ( n^+ - n^- ) [ ncharge ] related to the number @xmath0 of particles and anti - particles , respectively , where @xmath32 defines the absolute value of the charge .",
    "let us stress that if the kg equation for a complex scalar field admits a _ global _ @xmath29 symmetry , as in the case for the @xmath24 , @xmath25 mesons , `` merely '' a conserved particle number @xmath0 arises and the charge is the total strangeness @xmath28 .",
    "regarding the high degree of instability of pions , @xmath33 mesons , and higgs fields , the effect of gravitational binding is essential to see if these particles had enough time to form a bs .    in string theories",
    ", there may exist several fundamental scalar particles having different global or local charges .",
    "for example , for complex scalar particles with global @xmath29 symmetry or for real scalar particles , the bs charge shall be called just _ boson number _ @xmath0 . for complex scalar particles with local @xmath29 symmetry",
    ", the bs has a charge given by ( [ ncharge ] ) . in a bs with temperature near zero",
    ", we will assume that all constituents are particles , i.e.  no anti - particles present , or vice versa .",
    "in his model , kaup @xcite used a complex scalar field with global @xmath29 symmetry so that no gauge bosons are present .",
    "ruffini and bonazzola @xcite , however , took a real scalar field for the general relativistic bs and a complex scalar field with global @xmath29 symmetry for the newtonian bs description . in the case",
    "that @xmath29 symmetry is _ local _ , the complex scalar field couples to the gauge field contribution , cf .",
    "@xcite , p.  31 ; jetzer and van der bij @xcite called their hypothetical astrophysical object _ charged boson star _ ( cbs ) . within the glashow - weinberg - salam theory before symmetry - breaking of the group @xmath34 , this @xmath29 charge describes the weak hypercharge , and not an electric one . during the earliest stages of the universe , a complex scalar field with different kinds of @xmath29 charge ( than electric or hyperweak )",
    "could have been generated .",
    "there is also the particle / field classification with respect to the spatial reflection @xmath35 .",
    "both a real and a complex scalar field can be either a _ scalar _ or a _ pseudo - scalar_.    thus , particle characterisation will lead to different consequences for the detection of each bs model .      since einstein and bose",
    "it is well - known that scalar fields represent identical particles which can occupy the same ground state .",
    "such a _ bose - einstein condensate _",
    "( bec ) has been experimentally realized in 1995 for cold atoms of even number of electrons , protons , and neutrons , see anglin and ketterle @xcite for a recent review . in the mean - field ansatz ,",
    "the interaction of the atoms in a dilute gas is approximated by the effective potential u(||)_eff= ||^4 .",
    "[ ueff ] this leads to a _ nonlinear _ schrdinger equation for @xmath36 , in this context known as gross - pitaevskii equation . in a microscopic approach ,",
    "one introduces bosonic creation and annihilation operators @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively , satisfying [ b , b^ ] = 1 and finds that every number conserving normal ordered correlation function @xmath39 splits into the sum of all possible products of contractions @xmath40 as in wick s theorem of quantum field theory ( qft ) . for @xmath41",
    "one recovers the gross - pitaevskii equation , whereas the next order leads to the hartree - fock - bogoliubov equations , see @xcite for details .",
    "therefore , it is gratifying to note that bss with _ repulsive _ self - interaction @xmath42 considered already in refs .",
    "@xcite have their counterparts in the effective potential ( [ ueff ] ) of bec .",
    "thus , some authors @xcite advocate consideration of a cold bs as a _ self - gravitating _",
    "bec on an astrophysical scale .",
    "recently , the so - called _ vortices _ , collective excitations of becs with angular momentum in the direction of the vortex axis @xmath43 , have been predicted @xcite and then experimentally prepared @xcite . since ,",
    "quantum - mechanically , the z - component @xmath44 of the total angular momentum is necessarily quantised by the _ azimuthal _ quantum number @xmath45 ,",
    "it is not possible to  continuously \" deform this state to the ground state , and by this circumstance , contributing to its ( meta- ) stability . in 1996 , axisymmetric solutions of the einstein - kg equations have been found by us @xcite which are rotating bss ( differentially due to the frame - dragging in curved spacetime ) and exhibit , as a collective state , the same relation @xmath46 for the total angular momentum as in the case of the vortices of an bec and a meta - stability against the decay into the ground state as well ; cf .",
    "section [ rotabs ] .",
    "in this section , in a nutshell , bss are localised solutions of the coupled system of einstein and general relativistic klein - gordon ( kg ) equations of a complex scalar @xmath47 .",
    "depending on the self - interaction potential @xmath48 , bss have received different labels : in 1968 , kaup @xcite referred to the localised solution of the linear kg equation as a _ klein - gordon geon _ , whereas in 1987 , the same compact object was called _ mini - soliton star",
    "_ @xcite within a series of publications @xcite where also the terms _ scalar soliton star _ or just _ soliton star _ were introduced which nowadays are coined _ non - topological soliton star_. before , in 1986 , colpi et al .",

    "so , in 1989 , in a paper on stability , the mini - soliton star was renamed to _ mini - boson star _",

    "it is already realized that neither a schwarzschild type event horizon nor an initial singularity occurs in the corresponding numerical solutions .",
    "moreover , the problem of the stability of the resulting bs with respect to radial perturbations is treated .",
    "it is shown that such objects are resistant to radial gravitational collapse for a total mass @xmath50 below some _ critical _ mass and low central density ( related works include refs .",

    "all three definitions were investigated numerically in @xcite for spherically symmetric bss with the result that @xmath171 for one bs state ; with increasing central densities the bs radius decreases , there is a minimum at @xmath172 and a maximum around @xmath173 .",

    "bosons are not susceptible to the exclusion principle ; instead , they can all occupy the same ground state .",
    "that bosons can not be localised within their compton wavelength is guaranteed by heisenberg s uncertainty principle @xcite .    in atoms as well as in a bs ,",
    "the same principle applies and is the basic warranty for its stability against collapse . from a macroscopic point of view",
    ", our mathematical model shows that the macroscopic scalar radial pressure works against gravity . in a nutshell ,",
    "a cold bs is a huge bose - einstein condensate , as we demonstrated in more detail in section [ bec ] .      according to derrick s theorem @xcite",
    ", there are no stable time - independent solutions of scalar fields in _ flat _ 4d spacetime .",
    "one ingredient in order to circumvent this no - go theorem is to allow for a _ time - dependent _ phase factor @xmath184 in the stationarity ansatz ( [ statio ] ) for complex scalars . for bss , another factor is the attraction of the gravitational field which provides a counter - balance to the effective repulsion due to kinetic energy and corresponding parts in the self - interaction @xmath16 of the scalar field .",
    "moreover , for such soliton - type configurations kept together by their self - generated gravitational field , the issue of stability against _ gravitational collapse _ is crucial . in the spherically symmetric case ,",
    "it was shown by gleiser @xcite , jetzer @xcite , as well as lee and pang @xcite that bss with small central densities and masses below the kaup limit are stable against small radial perturbations .",
    "( kaup @xcite investigated the stability with respect to radial perturbations as well but came to a different answer . ) shortly afterwards , we have established via _ catastrophe theory _",
    "@xcite an even simpler way to prove _ stability _ of star solutions in general .",
    "the problem of non - radial pulsations of a bs was mathematically formulated @xcite and later quasinormal modes calculated @xcite ; cf .",

    "numerical simulations @xcite of a mini - bs together with a surrounding spherical shell consisting of a massless real scalar field have also led to qualitative stability predictions , comparable to results in @xcite as we show below . in the simulation , the real scalar field implodes towards the mini - bs centre ; both fields are merely interacting gravitationally .",
    "the pulse then passes through the origin , explodes and continues to infinity .",
    "meanwhile , the mini - bs is compressed into a state which ultimately forms either a bh or disperses , depending on initial data . by varying the initial amplitude of the real scalar field ,",
    "a critical solution is defined as lying between initial data resulting in bh formation and initial data giving rise to dispersal ; cf .  the numerical work on gravitational collapse of a massless real scalar in @xcite .    as starting point of the numerical solution ,",
    "a stable mini - bs solution is taken , and perturbed by the contribution of the real scalar field where two features are important : ( i ) the initial amplitude , the so - called critical parameter @xmath182 , and ( ii ) the form of initial data ( gaussian or kink ) .",
    "because of the choice of perturbation and a parameter value @xmath182 close to a critical value @xmath185 , the stable mini - bs is transformed into an intermediate oscillating unstable mini - bs state , the so - called critical solution ; cf .",
    "the closer @xmath182 is to @xmath185 , the more time the unstable mini - bs oscillates ; but , for @xmath186 , the mini - bs always `` explodes '' eventually , i.e.  disperses all matter to infinity , leaving just a diffuse remnant with low mass . for @xmath187 , the perturbed mini - bs forms a bh afterwards , where a finite minimal bh mass is found . due to this and a scaling law relating the lifetime @xmath188 of a near - critical solution to the proximity of the solution to the critical point [ @xmath189",

    "the _ critical mini - bs solutions _ are a hybrid of an unstable mini - bs solution and a small halo near the outer edge of the bs ; excited mini - bs states are not the explanation , they do differ significantly . the halo part seems to be just an artifact of the collision with the real scalar field .    additionally in @xcite , the numerical simulation method is used to investigate and verify earlier results on the stability against radial perturbations of mini - bs states with small and large central densities .",
    "the numerical simulation starts with a stable mini - bs solution . if the critical mini - bs solution is reached , and if one ignores the matter in its halo part , the rest is described by an unstable mini - bs solution with less mass than the stable star had , but larger central density value ( see fig .  16 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in fact , the numerical method of the linear perturbation theory of @xcite is compared with the simulation method .",
    "both results coincide with each other , but , moreover , explicit values of the frequencies of the fundamental mode and the first harmonic mode are given .",
    "for every existing mode , there are either two different stable mini - bs states , or just one unstable one .",
    "because the mode frequencies may have observational consequences , we mention them in section [ waves ] . here the binding energy @xmath190 has no meaning @xcite in understanding the transitions in the bs stability or the dynamics of the simulations .",
    "these new simulations are related to the results of an earlier paper @xcite where the stability was described qualitatively by catastrophe theory . in numerical simulations , instability arises when the square of the mode frequency is becoming negative , i.e.  there exist an exponentially increasing mode , and , by this , the mini - bs is destroyed .",
    "this starts to happen at extrema in the diagrams ( @xmath191 ) or ( @xmath192 , cf .",

    "the bifurcation diagram ( @xmath193 ) arises from a particular _ projection _ of this high dimensional parameter space . in fig .  2 of @xcite which is the alternative bifurcation diagram ( @xmath194 ) using the binding energy instead of the bs mass ,",

    "is considered for @xmath199 . there , for constant bs mass , two bs states exist , one stable and one unstable .",
    "perturbed bss will exhibit oscillations around these two bs states before such a state either collapses to a bh or disperses .",

    "are carried out , and we see good agreements between the simulations and the general predictions from catastrophe theory",

    "in a nut - shell , a bs is a stationary solution of a ( non - linear ) kg equation in its own gravitational field ; cf .",

    "it is obvious that inspiralling interstellar gas and stars will collide with each other , glue together within the bs , and so eventually form a bh .",

    "every matter is removed from the bs interior and no bh can form .",
    "but , as mentioned above , presumably matter will collide and glue together so that a bh can not be avoided ( i.e. , the particles have bound orbits ) .",
    "however , in case of a rotating bs , there is the possibility that matter could be guided along geodesics on the rotation axis forming jets ; this has still to be shown . for a bs in the limit @xmath231 , circular orbits are stable until about 5/3 times the radius of the doughnut hole @xcite .",
    "on the basis of an effective potential , it is shown @xcite that , for a spherically symmetric mini - bs , circular orbits exist for every value of the radial coordinate and are stable , even inside the bs . hence , accretion could follow a series of stable orbits and finally end up at the centre .",
    "further investigations are needed in order to clarify whether a bh forms .    what happens if the bs under external perturbations ( gravitating scalar matter ) is forced to leave the equilibrium ground state changing mass and particle number in the configuration ?",
    "the numerical simulations of @xcite show that stable mini - bss under finite non - infinitesimal perturbations start to oscillate , emit scalar field radiation , and settle down into a new mini - bs configuration with less mass and a larger radius . if the amount of scalar accretion matter does not exceed a critical value during some time , the bs is not jeopardised to form a bh .",
    "the emissivity properties of a geometrically thin , optically thick , steady accretion disc with constant accretion rate around a supermassive critical mini - bs are demonstrated in @xcite and compared with a bh of same mass .",
    "optical thickness means that the local effective temperature must be sufficient to radiate away the local energy production .",
    "the disc calculations are only valid where the gravitational potential is @xmath500 , i.e.  outside of the investigated mini - bs .",
    "one result is that , for the inner disc parts , a bs produces more power per unit area and a hotter disc than the comparable bh ; for this critical mini - bs , there is a temperature difference of about two thousand degrees in the inner parts of the accretion disc . for a bs with @xmath501",
    ", there is about the same maximal temperature but the position of that maximum is closer to the bs centre .",
    "the calculation of the final emission spectrum reveals a difference between the mini - bs and the bh model in the far ultraviolet regime @xmath502 hz ( fig .  3 in @xcite ) ; this disc model shows no production of x - ray or gamma - ray energy .",
    "the eddington luminosity , at the balance of the inward force of gravity with the outward pressure of radiation , is not exceeded within the mini - bs interior .",
    "thus , accretion could continue inwards a mini - bs .",
    "a further result @xcite is that the disc model does not describe the galactic centre sgr a@xmath503 neither for a bh nor a bs due to the accretion disc properties itself .",
    "it produces several order of magnitudes too much accretion luminosity .",
    "in contrast to observations is also the peak of the standard accretion disc broad band spectrum in the infrared .",
    "additionally , bss could disrupt stars @xcite .",
    "in general , there is a distance to a central object where the extension of a normal star can not be neglected and where tidal forces on the star become important .",
    "the corresponding so - called tidal radius is defined where @xmath504 is equal to the mean internal energy of the passing star .",
    "estimations show that bhs should have masses below @xmath505 so that they provoke disruption outside the event horizon .",
    "in general , such an event takes place once in about @xmath506 yrs .",

    "observations in the x - ray band within the central regions of active galaxies have shown an interesting feature , a doppler and gravitationally redshifted iron k@xmath101 line @xcite .",
    "it was claimed @xcite that the data can be understood as being emitted from within 1.5 schwarzschild radii near a rotating bh . in @xcite , we speculated that a bs geometry may be able to explain the data as well .",
    "recently in @xcite , a detailed numerical analysis of a geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disc around a supermassive critical mini - bs simulated this situation for different inclination angles . it is concluded that the observed line profile of the galaxy mcg-6 - 30 - 15 can not be fitted by a spherically symmetric mini - bs or bh for the chosen accretion disc model . for a possible identification of such a non - rotating mini - bs , the characteristic spectral feature would be the detection of an intense double peak for face - on galaxies or , for larger inclination angles , of several peaks of the long drawn - out k@xmath101 line .",
    "bss could exist in two more scenarios as it was pointed out in @xcite :    within host galaxies of quasars , bright hii regions are observed @xcite . by imagining that neutral hi gas clouds could gain kinetic energy in the gravitational potentials of bss , an excited hydrogen gas cloud , i.e.  hii , results .",
    "the second situation is that a light bs is completely contained within a nuclear burning star . in this case , both stellar structures would be interacting mutually , especially changing the model parameters of the conventional star .",
    "this resembles the so - called thorne - ytkow object , i.e. , a neutron star core inside a supergiant @xcite .",
    "if instead the bs matter has some kind of interaction with high energetic photons , it might be possible that the bs dissociates and the remaining scalar particles circulate freely within the conventional star .",
    "a so - called _ cosmion _ represents such a scenario and tries to explain the solar neutrino problem @xcite .",
    "the evolution of conventional nuclear burning stars follows the hertzsprung - russell diagram of the luminosity as a function of the temperature . during its life time , such a star has different stages which are expressed by a line in this diagram .",
    "there is the possibility that a bs could go through a continually evolution as well , if the gravitational attraction changes during the evolution of the universe .    in jbd or scalar tensor theory ,",
    "a real scalar field regulates the strength of the gravitational force , cf .",
    "section [ jbd ] .",
    "suppose that at the time of bs formation , the gravitational strength was different from the one prevailing today ; following this theory , @xmath266 was larger in the past .",
    "the real scalar field is actually a radial function so that the gravitational strength _ inside _ the jbd - bs is determined by a mutual gravitational interaction of the complex and the real scalar field matter .",
    "these investigations are outlined in section [ jbd ] . from the observational side",
    ", it may be important that , inside the bs , still the strength of the gravitational constant at formation time could be effective @xcite . according to this _ gravitational memory effect _ , the bs is book - keeping the evolution of @xmath266 .",
    "because the jbd field is a radial function and changes its value at infinity , there should be a repercussion on the bs .",
    "but if this change is much slower than the cosmological evolution of @xmath266 , the star is practically static . due to this effect",
    ", physical properties like the radius depend on formation time and could be different even for the same total mass .",
    "if instead the jbd field adapts quickly inside the jbd - bs as changes occur at infinity , the bs evolves as well .",
    "figure 1 in @xcite shows the mass against the value of the real scalar field at infinity for constant particle number .",
    "it is derived that the jbd - bs mass increases with increasing @xmath507 , i.e.  with time .",
    "one can understand that an increasing jbd field pumps energy into the bs and increases the mass .",
    "thereby , the _ evolution _ of a bs in jbd theory demonstrated in this figure 1 resembles the evolution in the hertzsprung - russell diagram of conventional stars .",
    "the physical properties as mass , radius , and stability is influenced by this repercussion @xcite , such that , for example , the mass changes about 2 % .",
    "in contrast to the complex case , real scalar fields do not possess a conserved charge or particle number .",
    "moreover , a static configuration @xmath508 , i.e.  ( [ statio ] ) for @xmath57 , would , in flat spacetime , be unstable due to derrick s theorem @xcite , whereas a superposition of positive and negative frequency states @xmath509@xmath510 is time - dependent and implies time - dependence of the energy - momentum tensor and the metric , as well .",

    "actually , our global stability analysis via catastrophe theory @xcite has revealed already earlier the existence of oscillating bss , as we will call them in the context of this review .",
    "q - stars are a class of non - topological solitons which are already discussed in detail in @xcite ; cf .",

    "the common characteristic of all such solutions is that they are singular or topological non - trivial @xcite . in @xcite ,",

    "again the scalar field possesses a singularity at the origin ; alternatively , one finds regular solutions at the centre , but the singularity is shifted to a finite distance .",

    "a combination of a bs with a fermion star has first been examined in the context of soliton stars @xcite . there",
    ", a semi - classical bs with the potential @xmath552 for a real scalar secures the existence of non - topological solitons , even in the absence of gravity .",
    "hence , only a conserved fermionic particle number @xmath553 exists ; that of real bosons is not well defined .",
    "furthermore , the real scalar interacts with the fermion field @xmath554 through @xmath555 , where @xmath285 is a yukawa type coupling constant . for simplicity",
    ", one adopts for the fermion mass @xmath556 so that the fermion has zero effective mass inside the false vacuum , i.e. , inside the bs . for the fermion field , a thomas - fermi approximation is chosen .",
    "remarkably , @xmath553 depends as @xmath557 on the mass , i.e. , fractional as for the cbs ( cf .",
    "section [ critical ] ) , whereas the total mass @xmath558 is similar to that of the soliton star .",
    "fermion soliton bhs are mentioned in section [ sbh ] .",
    "the observational properties of zero - mass fermion soliton stars are investigated in @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , only the effects of baryons entering the star are considered if the universe temperature drops below some critical value .",
    "for the special choice @xmath556 of lee and pang , all fermions are almost massless inside the fermion soliton star .",
    "moreover , the binding energy of constituent particles decrease to zero . hence ,",
    "if nuclei enter the star , they disintegrate into protons and neutrons , and then both into quarks . furthermore , the fermion soliton star contents differs in the course of universe evolution . above some critical temperature",
    ", protons can not enter ( or leave ) , and only quark pairs are inside the star .",
    "below that temperature , baryons can penetrate the star s shell and just quarks remain inside this so - called _ quark soliton star_. the fermion soliton stars with only quark pairs would finally radiate away all its energy and cease to exist ; only such stars with a net number of protons survive .",
    "these protons converts the rest energy into thermal energy so that for a short period of time ( about 10@xmath444 years ) at redshifts @xmath43 larger than 4 , these stars could be x - ray emitters .",
    "fermion soliton stars with dominating electron part may perturb the short wavelength character of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) , causing a sharp increase in the brightness temperature .    a quark soliton star at finite temperature including the same number of ( disintegrated ) protons and electrons , quark and @xmath559-@xmath560 pairs , and some so far unknown fermionic particles with _ ponderable _ mass are calculated in @xcite ; the result is labelled _ ponderable soliton star_.",
    "whereas the quarks in the pure quark soliton star are almost massless , the ponderable soliton star contains fermions with ponderable mass .",
    "the lifetime of the ponderable soliton star is from a few weeks to several years , they have a surface temperature of about 10@xmath561 k , and they radiate profusely with a luminosity as high as 10@xmath562 erg / s . because this temperature is close to the hydrogen recombination temperature of @xmath563 k , these stars could be observed at redshift distances of @xmath564 .",
    "this short radiation time is still longer than the evolutionary time of the universe at that epoch , and so , there may be an interaction with the cmb as well . the expected perturbations on cmb spectrum is less than 1% and it is largely around the short - wavelength at 1 mm or less , in form of point radio sources ; spatial inhomogeneities of arcsec scale should be observed .",
    "the situation of the fermion soliton star of lee and pang is extended in two respects in ref .  @xcite .",
    "first , it is shown that the soliton star is connected to the lee - wick model with scalar potential u ( ) = m^2 ^2 ( 1-/_0)^2 + b ( /_0)^3 . for a constant @xmath565 of about 100 mev as used in hadron spectroscopy , the fermion soliton star has a critical mass of about just three solar masses .",
    "additionally , the fermion soliton star at finite temperature is investigated and by this the formation and evolution of the stars . above a critical temperature around 100 mev ,",
    "the universe is filled by the homogeneous real scalar @xmath566 . below the critical temperature",
    "at which first - order phase transition occurs , the real scalar adopts its true vacuum state @xmath567 ; the false vacuum will only survive inside some bubbles filled with fermions .",
    "the bubbles contract until they are stabilised by the fermionic pressure , i.e. , the fermion soliton stars have formed . in the star s evolution , it is assumed that the star could evaporate into hadrons either at its surface or inside via nucleated bubbles .",
    "then , at present , fermion soliton stars would have a mass of about @xmath568 .",
    "a real scalar obeying a linear kg equation and the above mentioned lee - pang interaction are the ingredients of the model in @xcite .",
    "the fermionic matter has zero temperature so that one should expect no real scalar matter at @xmath515 ; responsible for the occurrence of the non - conserved scalar matter seems to be the yukawa interaction . in the model , instead of the exact stress - energy tensor of a dirac field as in @xcite ,",
    "the perfect fluid approximation for the neutron star interior is used .",
    "actually , ruffini and bonazzola @xcite proved that a large number of degenerate fermions can be approximated by the perfect fluid approach . additionally , the self - interaction factor @xmath569 is replaced by its expectation value following @xcite .",
    "then , the influence of the equation of state for an ideal fermi gas for neutron stars is investigated , following chandrasekhar @xcite , and nucleon - nucleon interactions are considered as well .",
    "it is not surprising that the hypothetical presence of a bs can change the cooling and the structure of the final state of a neutron star very effectively .",
    "the stability of combined boson - fermion stars built from a complex scalar is investigated in @xcite .",
    "a slowly rotating boson - neutron star based on kaup s linear potential and chandrasekhar s equation of state @xcite has been analysed in @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a boson - fermion star is calculated in a generalised jbd theory with @xmath342 where the brans - dicke field has a potential and , hence , a mass ; for the complex scalar , the potential @xmath271 is used and solutions are derived for @xmath570 . this work can be seen as an extension of @xcite ; cf .  the jbd section [ jbd ] .",
    "several papers on bss followed the old idea of oppenheimer and volkoff @xcite and applied a fluid approximation for the bosonic matter , which yields the correct order of magnitude for the total mass . in this section ,",
    "the bosonic fluid is isotropic .",
    "nishimura and yamaguchi @xcite constructed an equation of state for a cold higgs fluid & = & ( 0.5 < u^2 1 ) , + p & = & , where @xmath571 are the parameters of the higgs lagrangian , @xmath572 the first and second elliptic functions , respectively , and @xmath573 is some parameter . for several choices of @xmath574 , it is shown that the equation of state @xmath575 is an extrapolation of the equation of state of nuclear matter to higher density regions ; a further characteristic is that the pressure vanishes below some value of the central density .",
    "substituting this equation of state into the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation leads to bss with critical masses in the order of magnitude of a solar mass . in a way , by taking into account a bosonic self - interaction constant , nishimura and yamaguchi anticipated the result of colpi et al .",
    "@xcite who found the critical bs masses for the lagrangian , i.e.  anisotropic , description in the same mass region .",
    "furthermore , these bss have a finite radius , namely , the point where pressure as a function of radius vanishes .    takasugi and yoshimura @xcite investigated a non - self - interacting cold bose gas with the equation of state p = 3 m^2 n_0 ^ 2 u^8/3/(2 ) , = m n_0 u , where @xmath93 is the boson mass , @xmath430 the number density , @xmath576 some constant , and @xmath577 .",
    "we see that for small @xmath573 , @xmath578 and for large @xmath573 , @xmath579 . the critical mass is found to be 0.57 @xmath94 at a radius of 5.5@xmath580 which is remarkably close to the kaup limit 0.633 @xmath94 of the lagrangian description .",
    "three different equations of state are investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite . for massless bosons , the equation of state of photons",
    "is used @xmath581 , leading to photon stars , or  geons \" .",
    "the radius is determined where the surface pressure equals the one of the cosmological background radiation .",
    "the critical mass is about @xmath545 @xmath139 and the radius is larger than the radius of the universe , so that it seems that photon stars can not be found .",
    "alternatively , a giant mit bag filled with gluon matter is considered , hence , the calculation stops where the pressure is equal to the bag constant @xmath582 which is chosen to be 57 mev@xmath583fm@xmath444 .",
    "the equation of state can be written as @xmath585 .",
    "then , the critical mass of the gluon star is 2 @xmath139 .",
    "the third example describes a non - relativistic boson gas of massive particles where bose - einstein condensation is neglected , with an equation of state @xmath586 . because the pressure never vanishes in this model , the surface of these bss",
    "is defined by @xmath587 .",
    "the critical mass is about @xmath320 @xmath139 for @xmath588 gev/@xmath4 .",

    "thereby , the effective mass of the real scalar is zero , so that the corresponding bs solutions are called _",
    "precarious stars_. these stars exist only for temperatures above some value which is determined by the bag constant ; this coincides with the fact that the real scalar has no conserved charge , cf .",

    "departing from the newtonian spherically symmetric poisson equation , dehnen and gensheimer @xcite analysed a self - gravitating bose gas cloud with temperature .",
    "a similar situation was already considered by ingrosso and ruffini @xcite for an isothermal case , i.e. , constant temperature all over the cloud ; details can also be found in @xcite .",
    "the difference from the newtonian bss of section [ newtbs ] is that , here , an equation of state is derived that does not include a scalar field , but considers the bose - einstein statistics in its non - relativistic limit .",
    "it is found that the bose gas obeys a polytropic relation @xmath589 with some constant @xmath45 .",
    "the poisson equation reduces then to the lane - emden equation for polytropic index 3 . in general",
    ", it is found that the temperature decreases with increasing distance from the centre , hence , bose - einstein condensation occurs in the outer regions of the star .",
    "this result is in contrast to the isothermal case where the condensed phase is in the centre ( additionally the outer regions are boltzmannian and spatially unlimited ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these bose gas clouds have a finite radius where the energy density , the pressure , and the temperature vanish .",
    "these configurations , introduced in @xcite , describe a non - topological soliton star sitting completely inside the schwarzschild horizon which is possible due to the finiteness of such a star , cf .  the radius definition in section [ radii ] .",

    "thus , all these different scenarios have to be considered and further observational consequences drawn .    within the last three decades , a lot of models have been labelled bss , sometimes one and the same mathematical model received different physical designations .",
    "all models agree that the constituents of a bs are scalars .",
    "they differ in regards to whether the scalars are real or complex and whether the scalars are classical or field quantised . in this way , we can distinguish four basic types of bss .",
