    "recall that for a game @xmath119 the row - player s best response polytope is @xmath717 , and column - player s best response polytope is @xmath121 which may be obtained by replacing @xmath123 by @xmath124 in @xmath31 of ( [ eq3 ] ) .",

    "it has one defining hyper - plane if @xmath92 is either @xmath202 or @xmath203 , otherwise it has two parallel defining hyper - planes .",

    "every point @xmath738 may be written as a convex combination of @xmath298 and @xmath299 .",

    "this implies that @xmath741 .",
    "further , it is easy to see that the union of convex sets @xmath742 and @xmath743 forms the region @xmath711 ( lemma [ le51 ] ) , and hence the hyper - plane @xmath739 and @xmath740 defines the boundary of @xmath711 .    for the second part",

    "hence , the hyper - planes @xmath739 and @xmath740 define the boundary of the region @xmath711 ( lemma [ le51 ] ) .",
    "lemma [ le6 ] shows that the regions are very simple and they are defined by at most two hyper - planes .",
    "moreover , if @xmath739 and @xmath740 are the two defining hyper - planes of @xmath711 then @xmath746 .",
    "next , we discuss how the adjacency of @xmath92 in @xmath180 carries forward to the adjacency of the regions through the corresponding defining hyper - planes .",

    ". therefore the projection of edges @xmath770 on @xmath771-space is contained in @xmath724 and all the points on them are fully - labeled .",
    "the above facts imply that @xmath95 changes continuously inside the region ( @xmath711 ) as well as on the boundary ( @xmath772 ) , and their values come from the corresponding adjacent edges of @xmath33 ( @xmath773 , @xmath774 ) .",
    "moreover , the consistency is maintained across the regions through the nesps of the games on the common defining hyper - plane .",
    "all of these imply that there is a path between two points of @xmath23 iff the corresponding points in @xmath33 lie on the same component of @xmath33 .",
    "therefore @xmath23 does not form a single connected component if @xmath33 has more than one component . from the discussion in section [ games_polytopes ] , we know that @xmath33 contains at least a path and may contain some cycles .",
