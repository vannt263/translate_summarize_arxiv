    "we will also prove that _ global regular solutions can not exist_.    the proof of the theorem is built along sections 36 and concluded in section  [ proof main theorem ] .",
    "being inspired by fluid dynamics , the results of theorem  [ main_theorem ] could be interpreted as a form of _ turbulent dissipation_. dynamically speaking , it is a  dissipation due to a very fast cascade mechanism ; energy moves faster and faster from low to high wave numbers @xmath27 and escapes to infinity in finite time .",
    "results of anomalous dissipation for _ linear _ stochastic systems with additive noise have been proved by @xcite .",
    "the notion of anomalous dissipation of these papers is different and based on invariant measures , but conceptually the question is the same .",
    "the dyadic model of the present paper is , to our knowledge , the first nonlinear stochastic case where anomalous dissipation is proved to occur .",
    "moreover , the proof is entirely different from those of the additive noise linear stochastic case .",
    "nonlinear models with anomalous dissipation have been discovered before in the deterministic case ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our model is a multiplicative random perturbation of models of these forms . however , let us stress that the proof given here is totally different from the proofs of the deterministic literature , based on monotonicity and positivity properties of the deterministic part of system ( [ eq_stratonovich ] ) .",
    "these properties are lost in the stochastic case .",
    "theorem [ main_theorem ] remains true when @xmath28 for some @xmath29 .",
    "however , we make here the assumption @xmath12 in analogy with the deterministic literature on dyadic models .",
    "the proof is based on three main ingredients : ( i ) girsanov s transform allows us to reduce the problem to a linear stochastic equation ; ( ii ) second moments of components satisfy a closed system , without moments of products ; ( iii ) this closed system is the forward equation of a birth and death process , the escape of which at infinity can be understood .",
    "some issues in this procedure are not trivial .",
    "one of them is the equivalence of laws on infinite time horizon ( see proposition  [ prop : novikov_infty_time ] ) .",
    "its proof is nonstandard ; moreover , it is restricted to a range of values of parameters , the generalization being open .",
    "concerning the idea that square moments could satisfy a closed equation , related to jump process , we have been inspired by previous works ( @xcite and @xcite ) , however , devoted to different models ; the link here with the nonlinear model and the stochasticity is more transparent via girsanov s transform .",
    "the noise we introduced in equation  ( [ eq_stratonovich ] ) , motivated by energy conservation , may appear peculiar from the physical point of view .",
    "nevertheless , it is the natural choice if we compare the dyadic model with some other equations of fluid dynamics like euler s equations or diffusions of passive scalars .",
    "let us give a picture of this analogy in the case of euler s equations , which have the form @xmath30 with appropriate initial and boundary conditions ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the velocity and pressure field , resp . ) .",
    "let us think of periodic boundary conditions for sake of simplicity .",
    "the lagrangian motion of particles is given by the equation @xmath33 a natural way to randomly perturb euler dynamics ( see @xcite ) is by adding a white noise to the lagrangian motion , @xmath34 where @xmath35 are independent brownian motions and @xmath36 are given vector fields . by standard rules of stochastic calculus ,",
    "applied formally , one can see that euler equations take the stochastic form ( with a new pressure  @xmath37 ) @xmath38 \\,dt+\\sum_{j}\\sigma _ { j}\\cdot\\nabla u\\circ \\,dw^{j } ( t ) = 0 , \\qquad { \\operatorname{div}}u=0,\\ ] ] where stratonovich operation has to be used .",
    "rigorous results and physical arguments in support of this kind of stochastic perturbation of the lagrangian motion and the corresponding pde with multiplicative stratonovich noise ( in the viscous case ) can be found in @xcite .",
    "in addition , let us mention the wide literature on stochastic passive scalar equations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) where multiplicative stratonovich noise of the form above is used .    in abstract form , equation ( [ stoch euler eq ] ) takes the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
