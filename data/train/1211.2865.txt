    "scale - invariance embedded in physiological signals can shed light on mechanisms of dynamical processes occurring in human body , based upon which one can construct theoretical models of the processes and evaluate healthy states of disease suffers @xcite .",
    "a typical example is the scaling behaviors in different sleep stages . a cycle of healthy sleep persists typically @xmath3 to @xmath4 hours , which constitutes a sequence of sleep stages including wake , light sleep , rapid eye movement ( rem ) , and deep sleep .",
    "little is known about the specific functions of these circadian rhythms , it is believed that the deep and rem sleep states are essential for physical recreation and memory reconsolidation , respectively .",
    "extensive works show that heartbeat dynamics are characterized by long - range correlations and different long - range exponents are found for healthy and patients suffering from disease @xcite , and for different sleep stages @xcite .",
    "in particular , at different sleep stages long - range correlation occurs solely during rem sleep , which is similar while less pronounced to that during wakefulness .",
    "hence , scale - invariance embedded in heartbeat intervals can be used as an monitor of intrinsic neural - autonomic regulation of the circadian rhythms , which may find its potential use in disease diagnosis and therapy . but",
    "evaluation of scale - invariance in physiological signals meets two challenges .",
    "methodologically , variance - based methods , such as wavelet analysis @xcite and de - trended fluctuation approach@xcite , are widely used in literature to calculate scaling exponents .",
    "they can estimate correctly values of scaling exponents for fractional brownian motions , but incorrectly for levy walks , and even can not find out a scaling - invariant behavior existing in a levy flight process due to divergency of the second moment @xcite .",
    "a successful complementary method is diffusion entropy analysis . from a stationary time",
    "series , one can construct all the possible segments with a specified length .",
    "regarding the length as time duration , each segment can be regarded as a trajectory of a particle starting from original point .",
    "the time series is then mapped to an ensemble with the trajectories being realizations of a stochastic motion . from distribution function of displacement",
    "one can calculate shannon entropy , which is called diffusion entropy by scafetta et al.@xcite .",
    "detailed works prove its powerful in evaluation of scaling exponents for both fractional brownian and levy motions@xcite .",
    "practically , to obtain the probability distribution function , we divide the distribution region of displacement into many bins and reckon the number of displacements occurring in each bin . the occurring probability at a bin is generally approximated with relative frequency , namely , ratio between the occurring number and the total number of realizations , which is perfect for an ensemble with infinite number of realizations .",
    "however , a physiological signal is generally very short .",
    "sometimes we can obtain a long time series , but there occur some phase transitions in the measuring duration , which separate the series into short segments with different scaling behaviors , respectively . for example , a typical cycle of healthy sleep contains several thousands of heartbeat intervals , in which a sequence of transitions occur between different sleep stages . figure 2(a ) presents a long - term heartbeat interval series for a healthy subject .",
    "the lengths for wake , rem , light sleep , and deep sleep stages distribute in wide regions from @xmath5 to @xmath6 without characteristic lengths , respectively ( see materials ) .",
    "short length of time series may induce large statistical fluctuations and/or bias to physical quantities such as probability , moment , and entropy @xcite . in a recent paper , bonachela et al .",
    "@xcite review the efforts for improved estimators of entropy for small data sets and propose accordingly a balanced estimator that performs well when the data sets are small . in one of our recent papers ,",
    "we propose a new concept called balanced estimator of diffusion entropy ( bede ) @xcite , in which the original form of entropy in diffusion entropy analysis is replaced with the balanced estimator of entropy .",
    "calculations show that it gives reliable scaling exponents for short time series with length @xmath2 .    in the present paper ,",
    "the bede method is used to evaluate scaling behaviors in heartbeat series for different sleep stages and stride time series for normal , fast , and slow walkers .",
    "results show that for finite records of physiological signals the current methods in literature may lead to unacceptable errors for scaling exponents and wrong conclusions , while the bede approach can provide us a reliable estimation of scaling exponents .",
    "let us review briefly the concept of diffusion entropy @xciteproposed to detect scale - invariance in stationary series .",
    "for a stationary time series , @xmath7 , all the possible segments with specified length @xmath8 read @xmath9 we regard the length @xmath8 as time and consequently @xmath10 the @xmath11th realization of a stochastic process .",
    "the total @xmath12 realizations form an ensemble of the process .",
    "displacement of the @xmath11th realization read @xmath13    dividing the interval the displacements occur into @xmath14 bins , one can reckon the number of displacements occurring in each bin , denoted with @xmath15 .",
    "the probability distribution function can be approximated with the relative frequency @xmath16    the consequent naive approximation of shannon entropy reads    @xmath17.\\ ] ]    provided the stochastic process behaves scale - invariant , we have @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the size of bin , which is simply selected to be a certain fraction of standard deviation of the initial series . plugging eq.(5 ) into eq.(4 ) leads to @xmath20+\\delta ln(s)=a+\\delta ln(s),\\ ] ] as a powerful method , diffusion entropy ( de ) has been used to evaluate scaling invariance embedded in time series in diverse fields , such as solar activities @xcite , spectra of complex networks @xcite , physiological signals @xcite , dna sequences@xcite , geographical phenomena @xcite , and finance@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , extension of eq.(6 ) to the naive approximation of diffusion entropy is a nontrivial step , i.e. , generally @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "defining relative error , @xmath22 , after a straightforward computation we have , @xmath23.\\ ] ] the leading order of error , @xmath24 , vanishes as @xmath25 , while it may become unacceptable large when @xmath26 is finite . especially , for short time series the linear relation in eq.(6 ) will be distorted completely and one can not find scaling invariant behavior",

    "<S> by means of the concept of balanced estimation of diffusion entropy we evaluate reliable scale - invariance embedded in different sleep stages and stride records . </S>",
    "<S> segments corresponding to wake , light sleep , rem , and deep sleep stages are extracted from long - term eeg signals . for each stage </S>",
    "<S> the scaling value distributes in a considerable wide range , which tell us that the scaling behavior is subject- and sleep cycle- dependent . </S>",
    "<S> the average of the scaling exponent values for wake segments is almost the same with that for rem segments ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> wake and rem stages have significant high value of average scaling exponent , compared with that for light sleep stages ( @xmath1 ) </S>",
    "<S> . for the stride series , the original diffusion entropy ( de ) and balanced estimation of diffusion entropy ( bede ) give almost the same results for de - trended series . </S>",
    "<S> evolutions of local scaling invariance show that the physiological states change abruptly , though in the experiments great efforts have been done to keep conditions unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> global behaviors of a single physiological signal may lose rich information on physiological states . </S>",
    "<S> methodologically , bede can evaluate with considerable precision scale - invariance in very short time series ( @xmath2 ) , while the original de method sometimes may underestimate scale - invariance exponents or even fail in detecting scale - invariant behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the bede method is sensitive to trends in time series . </S>",
    "<S> existence of trend may leads to a unreasonable high value of scaling exponent , and consequent mistake conclusions . </S>"
