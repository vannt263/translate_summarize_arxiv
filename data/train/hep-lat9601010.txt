    "one integrates over the links @xmath23 with the fixed boundary values @xmath24 the external links @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the lattice implementation of the smooth classical boundary fields @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "it is worthwhile to stress that the functional eq .",
    "is invariant under arbitrary lattice gauge transformations of the boundary links .",
    "moreover , we note that in the numerical simulations of the lattice schdinger functional one can assume periodic boundary conditions in the spatial directions , while the periodicity in the time direction is lost if @xmath29 .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to investigate the lattice effective action for external background fields .",
    "let us consider a static external background field @xmath30 , where @xmath31 are the generators of the su(n ) lie algebra . on the lattice",
    "the dynamical variables are the links @xmath23 .",
    "the natural relation between the continuum gauge field and the corresponding lattice link is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the path - ordering operator .",
    "we can now define the lattice effective action for the background field @xmath34 by means of the lattice schrdinger functional eq.as follows : @xmath35 = -\\frac{1}{t }   \\ln \\left\\ { \\frac{{\\mathcal{z}}[u^{\\text{ext}}]}{{\\mathcal{z}}(0 ) } \\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the extension in the euclidean time .",
    "in equation we define @xmath37= { \\mathcal{z}}[u^{\\text{ext}},u^{\\text{ext}}]$ ] , and @xmath38 means the lattice schrdinger functional without external background field ( @xmath39 ) . from the previous discussion it is clear that @xmath40 $ ] is invariant for lattice gauge transformations of the external links @xmath41 .",

    "is now the familiar wilson action @xmath48 \\,.\\ ] ] in the remainder of this paper we test our definition of lattice effective action in the case of the simplest lattice gauge theory , namely the u(1 ) compact pure gauge theory without matter fields .",
    "it is known that for wilson action on a four - dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions , the electric charge is confined for @xmath49 , while for @xmath50 the gauge system is made of free photons . moreover ,",
    "the phase transition is triggered by the condensation of magnetic monopoles  @xcite . in the seminal paper by degrand and toussaint",
    "@xcite it has been shown that external magnetic fields are sensitive to the lattice magnetic monopoles .",
    "in particular , it turns out that for strong coupling ( in four dimensions ) monopoles screen external magnetic fields , while for weak coupling the magnetic fields penetrates into the lattice .",
    "thus it is worthwhile to investigate the lattice effective action for constant background magnetic fields . in the continuum",
    "the vector potential corresponding to a constant magnetic field along the @xmath51 direction is given by @xmath52 in the landau gauge . from eq .",

    "the action corresponding to the links   on a lattice of size @xmath58 with periodic boundary conditions is readily evaluated : @xmath59\\ ] ] where @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is the lattice volume . note that in the naive continuum limit @xmath62 reduces to @xmath63 .",
    "equation shows that , in order to be close to the continuum limit on a finite lattice , we must require that @xmath64 .",
    "this in turn implies that @xmath65 .",
    "moreover , in order to select the ground state contribution in the sum  , we also need @xmath66 . as a consequence we performed our numerical simulations on lattices with size @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we use the standard metropolis algorithm to update gauge configurations .",
    "the links belonging to the time slice @xmath16 are frozen to the configuration  .",
    "in addition we impose that the links at the spatial boundaries are fixed according to  . in the continuum",
    "this condition amounts to the usual requirement that the fluctuations over the background field vanish at the infinity .    as a preliminary step , it is important to test the behaviour of the magnetic field . to this end",
    "we look at the field strength tensor for a given time slice . we define @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the plaquette angle in the @xmath72 plane .",
    "clearly for @xmath16 ( or @xmath73 due to the periodic boundary conditions ) we have @xmath74 the other components of the field strength tensor being equal to zero . in figures  1 and 2",
    "we display @xmath75 versus the euclidean time @xmath76 for the @xmath77 lattice and @xmath78 . as expected , we find that only the component @xmath79 of the field strength tensor is present in our data . for",
    "@xmath80 the external magnetic field is shielded after a small penetration ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath81 ( fig .",
    "2 ) the field penetrates indicating that the gauge system supports a long range magnetic field .",
    "we now turn on the evaluation of the density of the effective action  .",
    "we face with the problem of computing a partition function which is the exponential of an extensive quantity  @xcite . to avoid this problem we consider the derivative of @xmath82 $ ] with respect to @xmath83 .",
    "we get @xmath84 =   \\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon \\left [ \\vec{a}^{\\text{ext } } \\right]}{\\partial \\beta } =   - \\frac{1}{\\omega } \\ , \\left [ \\frac{1}{z[u^{\\text{ext } } ] } \\frac{\\partial z[u^{\\text{ext}}]}{\\partial \\beta } - \\frac{1}{z[0 ] }   \\frac{\\partial z[u^{\\text{ext}}]}{\\partial\\beta } \\right ] \\,.\\ ] ] a straightforward calculation gives : @xmath85 =   \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{\\omega } \\sum_{x,\\mu>\\nu } \\cos \\theta_{\\mu\\nu}(x ) \\right\\rangle_0 - \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{\\omega } \\sum_{x,\\mu>\\nu } \\cos \\theta_{\\mu\\nu}(x ) \\right\\rangle_{a^{\\text{ext}}}\\ ] ] where the subscripts on the average indicate the value of the external links at the boundaries .",
    "as we have already discussed , in the deconfined region of our gauge system only the magnetic field directed along the third direction is present .",
    "thus we expect that the main contribution to the effective action density comes from the plaquettes in the 1 - 2 planes . to check this we look at the contributions due to the plaquettes in the @xmath72-planes to the derivative of the effective action density for a given time slice : @xmath86 =   \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{v } \\sum_{\\vec{x } } \\cos \\theta_{\\mu \\nu}(\\vec{x},x_4 ) \\right\\rangle_0 - \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{v } \\sum_{\\vec{x } } \\cos \\theta_{\\mu\\nu}(\\vec{x},x_4 ) \\right\\rangle_{\\vec{a}^{\\text{ext } } }   \\,.\\ ] ] figure  3 , where we display @xmath87 $ ] versus @xmath76 for @xmath88 , is in full agreement with our expectations .",
    "in figure  4 we show @xmath89 $ ] versus @xmath83 for three different lattice sizes and @xmath78 .",
    "a few comments are in order . for small @xmath83 ,",
    "@xmath89 $ ] reduces to a constant value that is the contribution due to the frozen boundaries .",
    "it should be emphasized that the density of the effective action can be recovered by integrating @xmath90 over @xmath83 : @xmath91 = \\int_0^{\\beta } \\ , d\\beta^{\\prime } \\",

    "the contribution due to the boundaries .",

    "@xmath94 this means that for large @xmath83 the effective action agrees with the classical action @xmath95 = \\varepsilon_{\\text{ext } } [ \\vec{a}^{\\text{ext } } ] = \\beta \\left [ 1 - \\cos \\left ( \\frac{2 \\pi}{l_1 } n^{\\text{ext } } \\right ) \\right ] \\,.\\ ] ] note that in the continuum limit @xmath96 and @xmath97 fixed , eq .   gives the classical energy density @xmath98 . a remarkable feature of fig .",
    "4 is the peak near @xmath99 . in figure  5",
    "we present the derivative of the effective action for values of @xmath83 near the critical region @xmath100 .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "5 that @xmath93 $ ] has a maximum as a function of @xmath83 which increases as function of @xmath101 .",
    "moreover the peak shrinks and shifts toward @xmath99 by increasing @xmath102 .",
