    "like the hard - sphere model in the theory of simple liquids , the classical one - component plasma ( ocp ) is a reference model in the study of strongly coupled coulomb systems and , in particular , of ions in strongly coupled plasmas @xcite . by definition ,",
    "the ocp consists of a system of identical ions of charge @xmath0 , mass @xmath1 and number density @xmath2 in an infinite three - dimensional space .",
    "particle dynamics is governed by the laws of classical , non - relativistic mechanics .",
    "the interaction energy between two ions separated by the distance @xmath3 is modeled by a yukawa potential @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a parameter used to describe the screening effect of the conduction electrons on the bare ion - ion coulomb interactions , and @xmath6 . in the limit @xmath7 , particles interact via the bare coulomb interaction and the ions must be immersed in a uniform , neutralizing background for well - posedness of the model .",
    "the equilibrium properties of the ocp depend on only two dimensionless parameters : the screening parameter @xmath8 and the coulomb coupling parameter @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the wigner - seitz radius and @xmath11 is the temperature .",
    "the coulomb coupling parameter measures the degree of non - ideality of the system , i.e. the degree to which many - body interactions affect the properties of the ensemble of ions .",
    "given a value for @xmath12 , the ocp shows transitions from a nearly collisionless , gaseous regime for @xmath13 continuously through an increasingly correlated , liquid - like regime to the wigner crystallization into a lattice near @xmath14 ( e.g. , @xmath15 at @xmath16 , @xmath17 at @xmath18 ) .",
    "the gas - like to liquid - like crossover manifests itself in several ways in the microscopic properties of the ocp .",
    "most noticeably , the coefficient of reduced shear viscosity ^*= , where @xmath19 is the plasma frequency defined below , exhibits a minimum at intermediate values around @xmath20 @xcite . in absolute units , the shear - viscosity coefficient @xmath21 increases monotonically with density along any isotherm , whereas along any isochore , @xmath21 exhibits a minimum as a function of temperature . in a fluid , transport of momentum",
    "occurs not only by the bodily movement of particles , but also by the direct transmission of intermolecular forces , which results from a competition between kinetic and interaction effects . at small coupling @xmath22 ,",
    "the former mechanism is predominant and , like in a gas , the ocp viscosity increases with increasing temperature . at large coupling @xmath23 ,",
    "the latter mechanism is predominant and , like in a liquid , the ocp viscosity decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "strong interparticle interactions give rise to the cage - effect @xcite , whereby each particle finds itself trapped for some period of time in the cage formed by its immediate neighbors , rebounding until it overcomes the energy barrier and diffuses to a neighboring cage . at intermediate coupling @xmath24 ,",
    "the two momentum transport mechanisms contribute with similar magnitude , resulting in a shallow minimum in the viscosity coefficient .    despite the apparent simplicity of the ocp model ,",
    "accurate determination of the viscosity coefficient of the ocp by molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations is difficult .",
    "this is exemplified by the significant discrepancies in the results obtained over the years by different authors . a compilation of these has been provided in @xcite .",
    "remarkably , important differences are found not only between results obtained using different md techniques , but also between those obtained using the same technique .",
    "for example , previous results obtained using equilibrium md are shown in figure  [ fig0 ] . among these ,",
    "the results of bastea @xcite are believed to be most accurate .",
    "recently , donk and hartmann have presented arguably the most accurate results for moderately and strongly coupled ocp s at @xmath25 using two independent _ non - equilibrium _ md simulation methods , namely the mller - plathe reverse md approach and the evans - morriss homogeneous shear algorithm . in the present paper ,",
    "we use _ equilibrium _ md based on the evaluation of the green - kubo relation to validate the non - equilibrium md results of donk and hartmann and the equilibrium md results of bastea for the coulomb ocp ( @xmath16 ) .    )",
    "obtained by different authors @xcite using equilibrium molecular dynamics and the green - kubo relation .",
    "results obtained using non - equilibrium molecular dynamics are compiled in @xcite . ]",
    "there are a couple of reasons why this is important .",
    "donk and hartmann chose non - equilibrium md methods , claiming that they are generally more efficient than equilibrium calculations .",
    "indeed , we shall see that the determination of viscosity from the green - kubo relation is made difficult by the large statistical imprecision in the calculation of the shear - stress autocorrelation function .",
    "this arises mainly due to the fact that simulation averages are taken over finite - length runs .",
    "the noise can be satisfactorily reduced at the price of very long simulations , but this requires much longer run times than have previously been reported . despite the computational cost , equilibrium md has advantages .",
    "it provides information about the microphysical ion dynamics , in particular the time - correlation function of the shear stress .",
    "it works equally well for all @xmath12 and @xmath26 values , including the coulomb ocp .",
    "the same simulation can be used to consistently calculate all other transport and static properties of the plasma .",
    "furthermore , it provides an independent method that allows us to confirm donk and hartmann s results . in the past",
    ", much effort has been devoted to develop a theory that extends the traditional plasma regime valid at small @xmath26 to the moderate and strongly coupled regimes .",
    "an accurate determination of the shear - viscosity is desirable to test existing and future theories . in this paper",
    ", we test the conventional result of landau - spitzer , the kinetic theories of wallenborn - baus  @xcite , viellifosse - hansen  @xcite and of tanaka - ichimaru  @xcite , and the recent effective potential theory of baalrud - daligault  @xcite .",

    "in the previous section , we compared the md results with the seminal theory of landau - spitzer . in this section ,",

    "briefly , the known short - time expansion of the transverse - current autocorrelation function @xmath32 up to fourth - order in time @xmath33 was used to build a gaussian approximation of the memory function associated to @xmath34 .",
    "the coefficients of the gaussian approximation depended on the first three frequency sum - rules of @xmath34 that can be exactly written in terms of the pair distribution function @xmath35 and of the ternary distribution function @xmath36 . using the superposition approximation to express @xmath37 in term of @xmath38 ,",

    "however , this good agreement may be fortuitous since , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , the vieillefosse - hansen model greatly underestimate the viscosity at all other values of @xmath26 .",
    "wallenborn and baus applied the framework of renormalized equilibrium kinetic theory , a general kinetic theory of phase - space correlation functions , to derive an analytical model for the shear - viscosity coefficient @xcite . in this framework , the shear - viscosity coefficient can be exactly expressed in terms of the only unknown of the theory , the so - called generalized memory function .",
    "they derived a sophisticated approximation for the latter that , by construction , attempts to account for ( i.e. renormalize ) the correlated motion of ions .",
    "their approximation reduces to the lenard - balescu collision operator when all the quantities involved in the memory function ( e.g. , the direct correlation function ) are approximated by their weakly - coupled limiting values .",
    "they then used their approximate memory function to calculate the shear - viscosity coefficient across coupling regimes .",
