    "in recent years a growing interest in studying non - linear models has appeared , since they can be used to describe many physical situations .",
    "this leads typically to the analysis of non - linear differential equations , which are harder to solve than the linear ones .",
    "however , there are solution methods to solve them , which mainly consist in reducing non - linear equations to linear ones .",
    "this approach has been employed for obtaining solutions of the painlev equations , which we are particularly interested in .",
    "although discovered from strictly mathematical considerations , the painlev equations are widely used nowadays to describe physical phenomena @xcite .    when is based on supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susy qm ) , this method transforms the non - linear equations into schrdinger type ones .",
    "in addition , if we end up with a previously solved schrdinger equation this problem will be further simplified .",
    "in particular , this works for the painlev iv equation ( @xmath0 ) @xcite , which is relevant in fluid mechanics , non - linear optics , quantum gravity @xcite , and susy qm applied to the harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "in fact , a simple method to generate solutions of @xmath0 can be supplied , since the susy technique provides explicit expressions for the relevant extremal states and formulae connecting them with the @xmath0 solutions @xcite .",
    "this contribution is organized as follows : in sections 2 and 3 we shall present the general framework of susy qm and polynomial heisenberg algebras ( pha ) . in section 4",
    "we will generate the complex solutions to @xmath0 , while in section 5 we will study the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the non - hermitian hamiltonians .",
    "our conclusions shall be presented in section 6 .",
    "in the @xmath1-th order susy qm one starts from a given solvable hamiltonian @xmath2 and generates a chain of standard ( first - order ) intertwining relations @xcite @xmath3 , \\quad j = 1,\\dots , k.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , the following equations must be satisfied @xmath4 ,   \\label{rei } \\\\   & \\hskip1.0 cm    v_{j}(x ) = v_{j-1}(x ) - \\alpha_j'(x,\\epsilon_j ) .",

    "a @xmath10-th order pha is a deformation of the heisenberg - weyl algebra of kind @xcite : @xmath11    & = \\pm l^\\pm , \\qquad [ l^-,l^+ ]    \\equiv q_{m+1}(h+1 ) - q_{m+1}(h ) = p_m(h ) , \\\\   & \\hskip2.0 cm   q_{m+1}(h )   = l^+ l^- = \\prod_{i=1}^{m+1 } \\left(h - \\mathcal{e}_i\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is a @xmath13-th order polynomial in @xmath14 , @xmath15 is a polynomial of order @xmath10 in @xmath14 and @xmath16 are the zeros of @xmath17 , which correspond to the energies associated to the extremal states of @xmath18 .    for the second - order pha ( @xmath19 ) , let us suppose from now on that @xmath20 is a third - order differential ladder operator of the form : @xmath21 , \\qquad l_2^+ = \\frac12\\left [ \\frac{d^2}{d x^2 } + g(x)\\frac{d}{d x } + h(x)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the standard first and second - order susy qm and decoupling the resulting system gives rise to equations for @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 in terms of @xmath25 and the following condition : @xmath26 this is the painlev iv equation ( @xmath0 ) with parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "hence , if the three quantities @xmath16 are real , we will obtain real parameters @xmath29 for the corresponding @xmath0 .",
    "the key point now comes from the inverse method : instead of solving directly @xmath0 to get a system ruled by a second - order pha let us choose a system having this algebra ( i.e. with third - order ladder operators ) in order to obtain then the solutions to @xmath0 .",
    "let us use a theorem stating the conditions for the hermitian higher - order susy partners of the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian to have second - order pha ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the main requirement is that the @xmath1 schrdinger seed solutions have to be connected in the way @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the standard annihilation operator , the only free seed @xmath32 is a nodeless real solution of eq .",
    "associated to a real factorization energy @xmath33 such that @xmath34 .    in order to overcome the last restriction , so that @xmath35 but the susy transformation being still non - singular , we need to use complex seed solutions .",
    "let us choose them as complex linear combinations of the two standard linearly independent real solutions so that , up to an unessential factor , we will employ @xcite : @xmath36 , \\label{u1}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the confluent hypergeometric ( kummer ) function .",
    "hence , through this formalism we will obtain simultaneously the @xmath1-th order susy partner potential @xmath39 of the harmonic oscillator and the corresponding @xmath0 solution @xmath40 , both of which are complex , in the following way @xmath41\\ } '' , \\qquad g(x;\\epsilon_1 ) = - x - \\{\\ln[\\psi_{\\mathcal{e}_1}(x)]\\ } ' , \\label{solg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be compared with those obtained in @xcite through bcklund transformations .",
    "note that the extremal states of @xmath42 and their corresponding energies are given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",

    "let us analyze the hamiltonian @xmath56 obtained by the complex susy transformation .",
    "the real case with @xmath57 , leading to hermitian hamiltonians , has been studied previously @xcite .",
    "the spectrum @xmath58 consists of an infinite ladder plus a finite one : there are two extremal states ( both annihilated by @xmath59 ) from which the two ladders start , one associated to @xmath60 and the other to @xmath61 ; since the ladder starting from @xmath60 ends at @xmath33 , the eigenfunction associated to @xmath33 is annihilated by @xmath62 .",
    "the actions of @xmath63 onto any other eigenstate of @xmath56 are non - null and connect only eigenstates belonging to the same ladder .    in the complex case ,",
    "the new hamiltonians necessarily have complex eigenfunctions ( square - integrable ) , although the associated eigenvalues are still real .",
    "the resulting spectra for the non - hermitian hamiltonians @xmath56 obey the same criteria as the real case , namely , they are composed of an infinite ladder plus a finite one which now could be placed , either fully or partially , above @xmath61 .    the case when @xmath33 belongs to the spectrum of the original harmonic oscillator hamiltonian is worth of a detailed study .",
    "thus , let us consider a @xmath1-order susy transformation with @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath32 given by eq .",
    ", i.e. , @xmath32 is a complex linear combination of the eigenfunction @xmath66 of @xmath67 and the other linearly independent solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the action of the third - order ladder operators applied to the eigenstate with energy @xmath68 is given by @xmath69 these results do not match with the established criteria for the non - singular real and complex cases with @xmath70 since now it turns out that : @xmath71 where the shown energies correspond to the departure state .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian is isospectral to the harmonic oscillator but with a special algebraic structure since now two states ( those associated to @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) are connected just in one way with the adjacent ones ( see a diagram representing this in fig .",

    "sp(@xmath56 ) still contains one finite and one infinite ladders , but this is not true for ( b ) .",
