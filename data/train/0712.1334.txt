    "the magnitudes of the effective potential are almost of the order of size of the extra dimensions . therefore ,",
    "since possibilities of the tev - scale extra dimensions are pointed out @xcite , the ewghu scenario has been extensively studied in the context of the dynamical gauge - higgs unification @xcite . however , in the construction of a realistic model of the ewghu in the flat extra dimension , we encounter several obstacles . to see this ,",
    "let us consider the models with `` flat extra dimensions '' . here",
    "models with flat extra dimensions are models such that ( i ) extra dimensional space has vanishing curvature ( e.g. , a circle @xmath8 or @xmath9-torus @xmath10 ) .",
    "( ii ) the metric of the spacetime is assumed to be `` factorizable '' , in other words , the metric of the four - dimensional space - time can be independent of coordinates of extra dimensions .",
    "the obstacles we will see in these models are as follows .    *",
    "[ light - higgs ] in models of the ewghu with dynamical gauge - higgs unification in a flat extra dimension , we obtain too small higgs mass . in @xcite",
    "the higgs mass @xmath11 is estimated to be @xmath12 , where @xmath13 with the four - dimensional ( 4d ) weak coupling @xmath14 . with @xmath15 and @xmath16",
    ", we obtain @xmath17 , which contradicts the observation . * [ universal - yukawa ] in models of the ewghu in the flat extra dimension , the mass of the quarks and leptons tend to be universal and the mixing matrix of quarks to be diagonal , because the gauge coupling constant yields the `` yukawa couplings '' of fermions to the higgs in the gauge - higgs unification .",
    "therefore , it needs some other mechanisms to induce large mass hierarchy and mixings among fermions . *",
    "[ light - flavor ] in the models in the flat extra dimension , one of the simplest way to give different masses to fermions is to assign the different bulk mass term to each fermion .",
    "then , in the ewghu the mass of the lowest kaluza - klein ( kk ) mode of such a bulk fermion is estimated to be @xmath18 , with the wilson line phase @xmath19 , compactification radius @xmath20 and bulk mass of the fermion @xmath21 .",
    "thus , a fermion with larger ( smaller ) bulk mass can be heavier ( lighter ) in the four dimensional effective theory . since the effective potential decrease in size with increasing the bulk mass of the fermion @xcite , it lead us to an odd conclusion : _ a light fermion ( e.g. , up-,down - quark or electron ) has large contribution to the effective potential of the higgs . _",
    "the low energy dynamics of the ewghu in the flat extra dimension looks very different from 4d models of the electroweak symmetry breaking by the coleman - weinberg ( cw ) mechanism @xcite .    in recent years , models of electroweak gauge - higgs unification in the randall - sundrum ( rs ) space - time @xcite",
    "have been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "we first summarize the merits of the dynamical gauge - higgs unification in the rs space - time .",
    "they are    * the hierarchy between electroweak and a larger scale ( e.g. , the planck scale ) are explained by the nature of the rs space - time @xcite , whereas the quadratic divergence of the higgs mass is absent due to the higher - dimensional gauge symmetry @xcite . *",
    "the extra dimension of the rs has the orbifold topology @xmath22 . on such space - time",
    ", we can naturally obtain the chiral structure of fermions by boundary conditions at the fixed points .",
    "@xmath23 projection also yields the higgs field in the fundamental representation of @xmath24 from the gauge field in the adjoint representation of a gauge group which includes the @xmath25 . * in the rs space - time , we can obtain large mass differences among fermions by tuning bulk mass parameters of fermions of order of unity @xcite . in the same way we can obtain large mass hierarchy among fermions in the ewghu in the rs space - time @xcite . * the mass of the higgs",
    "will be lifted up to a few hundred when we consider the dynamical gauge - higgs unification in the rs space - time @xcite .",
    "* when we implement the standard model in the rs space - time , the higgs field ( i.e. , the 5th - dimensional component of the gauge field ) is naturally localized on the tev brane .",
    "we note that such a localization of the higgs on the tev brane is usually required in the context of the 5d extension of the standard model in the rs space - time @xcite .",
    "the dynamical gauge - higgs unification in the randall - sundrum space - time is first considered in @xcite and effective potential by fermion without bulk mass is evaluated in it .",
    "an appropriate form of the background gauge in the rs space - time and the calculation of the effective potential from gauge - ghost loop is studied in @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological studies of the ewghu in the rs space - time are seen in @xcite .",
    "we note that there are series of works @xcite , based on the ads / cft dual or `` holographic '' picture @xcite .",
    "the wilson - line dynamics in the warped extra dimension has also been studied in @xcite by means of the dimensional deconstruction @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the dynamical gauge - higgs unification in the randall - sundrum space - time .",
    "the aim of the present paper is the following threefold .",
    "first , we evaluate the effective potential of wilson line and discuss the gauge symmetry breaking by the dynamical gauge - higgs unification and to evaluate the mass of the higgs field .",
    "especially we are interested in the one - loop effective potential for the loop of fermion with a bulk mass term .",
    "second , we make clear the relation between the fermion mass spectrum and the effective potential in this model . in the case of warped extra dimension , the lowest kk mass of the fermion decreases in size with increasing absolute value of the bulk mass .",
    "therefore we expect that in the rs space - time , a heavy fermion in the 4d effective theory will have large contribution to the effective potential and a light one has small contribution , as we have seen in the cw mechanism",
    ". we will demonstrate it is true .",
    "third , we use the dynamical gauge - higgs unification in the rs space - time to construct a model of the ewghu with realistic mass spectrum of fermions and a higgs potential .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec - hosotanimech ] , we study the @xmath0 gauge model in the rs space - time and evaluate the one - loop effective potentials from the fermion loop and see how the effective potential and the gauge symmetry depends on the bulk muss term of the fermion . in section [ sec - su3model ] , as an application of the dynamical gauge - higgs unification in the rs space - time , we reconsider the @xmath1 gauge model as a toy model of ewghu in the warped extra dimension . section [ sec - summary ] is devoted to the summary and comments . in appendix",
