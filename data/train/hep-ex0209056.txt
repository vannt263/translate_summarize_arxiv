    "starting the 1960 s with the pioneering experiments of davis and his collaborators @xcite using chlorine as a solar neutrino detection medium , a discrepancy was identified between the experimental measurements and the theoretical calculations @xcite for solar neutrino fluxes .",
    "table 1 lists the results for neutrino fluxes from experiments up to the year 2000 and compares them with solar model calculations .",
    "the rates are factors of two or three lower than predictions in each case , leading to the conclusion that either solar models are incomplete or there are processes occurring such as flavor change to neutrino types for which the experiments have little or no sensitivity .",
    "this 30-year old discrepancy had come to be known as the `` solar neutrino problem '' .",
    "many attempts have been made to understand these discrepancies in terms of modifications to the solar model , without significant success .",
    "the results may be understood in terms of neutrino flavor change in vacuum or with matter enhancement in the sun@xcite . however , clear interpretation in terms of neutrino flavor change depends upon solar models because the various experiments have different thresholds and are sensitive to different combinations of the nuclear reactions in the sun .",
    "therefore solar model - independent approaches have also been pursued experimentally to seek an unambiguous indication of flavor change .",
    "these approaches have included searches for spectral distortion , day - night and seasonal flux differences by super - kamiokande@xcite .",
    "these measurements are accurate but have provided no clear indication of flavor change to date .    [ !",
    "ht ]        the possible effect of neutrino flavor regeneration in the earth after flavor change in the sun has been studied through the day - night asymmetry , defined as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 .",
    "the super - kamiokande results for @xmath0 neutrinos @xcite are : @xmath3 showing no clear indication of regeneration .",
    "figure 1 shows the dependence of the solar neutrino flux measured by super - kamiokande  @xcite on zenith angle as well as the day - night comparison .",

    "the charged current ( cc ) reaction @xmath5 is specific to electron neutrinos , whereas the neutral currrent ( nc ) reaction : @xmath6 is sensitive to all non - sterile neutrino types equally",
    ".    the elastic scattering ( es ) reaction on electrons : @xmath7 is also sensitive to non - sterile neutrino types other than electron neutrinos , although they have about six times smaller cross section than electron neutrinos .",
    "therefore , another solar - model - independent measurement of neutrino flavor change can be obtained by comparing the cc interactions with the es interactions .",
    "the sno collaboration have recently reported results from 306 live days of data with pure heavy water as a detection medium@xcite .",
    "the flux of @xmath8 s from @xmath9b decay is measured by the cc reaction rate , assuming no spectral distortion .",
    "comparison of @xmath10 to the value of @xmath11 provides a null hypothesis test for neutrino flavor change .",
    "the flux of active neutrinos or anti - neutrinos other than electron neutrinos inferred from these two measurements yields a @xmath12 difference , assuming the systematic uncertainties are normally distributed , providing clear evidence that there is a non - electron neutrino flavor active component in the solar flux .",
    "figure  [ snofig2 ] ( a ) displays the distribution obtained by sno for @xmath13 , the angle between the reconstructed direction of the event and the instantaneous direction from the sun to the earth .",
    "the forward peak in this distribution arises from the kinematics of the es reaction , while cc electrons are expected to have a distribution which is @xmath14  @xcite , before accounting for detector response .    normalized to the integrated rates above the kinetic energy threshold of @xmath15@xmath16  mev , the flux of @xmath9b neutrinos measured with each reaction in sno , assuming the standard spectrum shape  @xcite is ( all fluxes are presented in units of @xmath17 ) : electron neutrino cross sections are used to calculate all fluxes .",
    "the excess of the nc flux over the cc and es fluxes implies neutrino flavor transformations .",
    "the result for the total active neutrino flux obtained with the nc reaction is in very good agreement with the value calculated  @xcite by solar models : @xmath18 .    a simple change of variables resolves the data directly into electron ( @xmath19 ) and non - electron ( @xmath20 ) components .",
    "this change of variables allows a direct test of the null hypothesis of no flavor transformation ( @xmath21 ) without requiring calculation of the cc , es , and nc signal correlations . @xmath22 assuming the standard @xmath23b shape . combining the statistical and systematic uncertainties in quadrature , @xmath20 is @xmath24 , which is 5.3@xmath25 above zero , providing strong evidence for flavor transformation consistent with neutrino oscillations  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ hime_plot ] shows the flux of non - electron flavor active neutrinos vs the flux of electron neutrinos deduced from the sno data .",
    "the three bands represent the one standard deviation measurements of the cc , es , and nc rates .",
    "the error ellipses represent the 68% , 95% , and 99% joint probability contours for @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",

    "the intercepts of these bands with the axes represent the @xmath28 errors .",
    "the bands intersect at the fit values for @xmath19 and @xmath20 , indicating that the combined flux results are consistent with neutrino flavor transformation assuming no distortion in the @xmath23b neutrino energy spectrum.,width=355 ]    spectra for day and night time periods have also been obtained by sno that show no statistically significant differences , in agreement with the previous measurements by super - kamiokande . if oscillation solely to a sterile neutrino is occurring , the sno cc - derived @xmath9b flux above a threshold of 6.75 mev will be consistent with the integrated super - kamiokande es - derived @xmath9b flux above a threshold of 8.5 mev@xcite . adjusting the es threshold@xcite",
    "this derived flux difference is @xmath29 @xmath30 , or 3.1@xmath25 away from zero , implying that the oscillation is not solely to sterile neutrinos .",
    "more recent results sno  @xcite and super - kamiokande  @xcite with lower thresholds increase this difference to more than 4.5@xmath25 away from zero .",
    "sno s day and night energy spectra have also been used to produce msw exclusion plots and limits on neutrino flavor mixing parameters  @xcite .",
    "msw oscillation models between two active flavors were fit to the data . for simplicity , only the energy spectra were used in the fit , and the radial @xmath31 and direction @xmath32 information was omitted .",
    "this procedure preserves most of the ability to discriminate between oscillation solutions .",
    "a model was constructed for the expected number of counts in each energy bin by combining the neutrino spectrum , the survival probability , and the cross sections with sno s response functions .",
    "there are 3 free parameters in the fit : the total @xmath9b flux @xmath33 , the difference @xmath34 between the squared masses of the two neutrino mass eigenstates , and the mixing angle @xmath35 . the flux of higher energy neutrinos from the solar _ hep _ reaction was fixed at @xmath36  @xmath37  s@xmath38  @xcite .",
    "contours were generated in @xmath34 and @xmath39 for @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "[ fig : mswsno](a ) shows allowed mixing parameter regions using only sno data with no additional experimental constraints or inputs from solar models . by including flux information from the cl and ga experiments , the day and night spectra from the sk experiment , along with solar model predictions for the more robust @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44be neutrino fluxes  @xcite , the contours shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mswsno](b ) were produced .",
    "this global analysis strongly favors the large mixing angle ( lma ) region , and @xmath39 values @xmath45 . while the absolute chi - squared per degree of freedom is not particularly large for the low solution , the difference between chi - squared values still reflects the extent to which one region of msw parameter space is favored compared to another .",
    "repeating the global analysis using the total sno energy spectrum instead of separate day and night spectra gives nearly identical results .",
    "these results have been analyzed by many other authors .",
    "in general , only the lma , low and in some cases the vac regions remain at the 3 sigma level , with the lma region strongly favored .",
    "the authors of reference  @xcite have shown an upper limit of about 33% for the possible sterile neutrino flux from the sun .",
    "all of the experiments with data to date plan to continue with solar neutrino measurements .",
    "kamiokande has been converted to the kamland experiment by the addition of liquid scintillator and will have a lower threshold .",
    "the chlorine , gno and sage experiments will add to the accuracy of their measurements by further counting and will improve upon the determination of the low energy region of the solar neutrino spectrum .",
    "super - kamiokande is in the process of re - filling the detector after reinstalling the remaining phototubes following the major implosion last year .",
    "the community was shocked by the accident that befell the super - kamiokande experiment in november , 2001 and is very hopeful that the efforts now in progress will re - establish the capability of this great experiment as soon as possible .",
    "the sno experimental plan calls for three phases where different techniques are employed for the detection of neutrons from the nc reaction on deuterium .",
    "the nc reaction has a threshold of 2.2 mev and is observed through the detection of neutrons by the three different techniques . during the first phase , with pure heavy water , neutrons were observed through the cerenkov light produced when neutrons are captured in deuterium , producing 6.25 mev gammas . in this phase ,",
    "the capture probability for such neutrons is about 25% and the cerenkov light is relatively close to the threshold of about 5 mev electron energy , imposed by radioactivity in the detector . for the second phase ,",
    "started in june , 2001 , about 2.5 tonnes of nacl were added to the heavy water and neutron detection is enhanced through capture on cl , with about 8.6 mev gamma energy release and about 83% capture efficiency . for the third phase , due to begin in 2003 , the salt will be removed and an array of @xmath46- filled proportional counters will be installed to provide direct detection of neutrons with a capture efficiency of about 45% . with the added sensitivity to neutrino types other than electron neutrinos via the nc reaction , the accuracy for the determination of neutrino flavor change will be increased significantly .",
    "there are many other experiments planned in the future to provide measurements of solar neutrinos with lower energy thresholds in real time .",
    "the kamland experiment will report results soon and could have the capability to observe @xmath44be neutrinos .",
    "the borexino experiment should also have the capability for observing @xmath44be neutrinos and could have lower radioactive backgrounds in that region .",
    "a comprehensive summary of other planned low - energy solar neutrino measurements has been presented by s. schonert at the neutrino 2002 conference .",
    "many authors have analyzed the future capabilities of the existing experiments for restricting the allowed regions of parameter space in future . a major restriction on oscillation parameters for active neutrinos",
    "could be provided by the results from the kamland experiment for reactor neutrinos if the correct solution is lma . when these results are combined with the sno results ,",
    "significant restrictions can be placed on sterile neutrinos without reliance on solar model calculations  @xcite .",
    "initial solar fluxes of electron neutrinos can also be determined with high accuracy through the combination of these experimental results .    in summary ,",
    "the set of solar neutrino experiments to date have provided a clear picture of neutrino properties and definitive tests of solar models .",
    "the future measurements show excellent promise for a fuller understanding of neutrino and solar properties as these and other experiments proceed .",
