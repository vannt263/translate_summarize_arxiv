    "in metallic magnets without inversion symmetry  so - called chiral ferromagnets  spin - orbit coupling effects determine the physics decisively : they can twist the magnetization into a helix in the ordered phase of the material .",
    "prominent examples are mnsi and fege , which have for a long time been known to exhibit spiral order @xcite .",
    "recently , interest in such materials has been renewed with a number of experiments that on the one hand found non - fermi liquid behaviour in a large temperature and pressure region of the phase diagram @xcite , and on the other hand uncovered signs of a peculiar partially ordered state in neutron scattering experiments @xcite .    in the ordered state of mnsi ,",
    "helical order is observed in neutron scattering experiments in the form of bragg peaks situated on a sphere in reciprocal space .",
    "the radius of this sphere is proportional to the inverse pitch of the helix , and the peaks are positioned in the @xmath0-directions .",
    "this locking of the helices is due to higher order spin - orbit coupling effects . for temperatures down to 12",
    "k the phase diagram exhibits a second - order phase transition out of the helical into the disordered , isotropic phase when external pressure is applied .",
    "below 12 k , helical order is lost at external pressure of 12 - 14 kbar via a first - order phase transition into a `` partially - ordered '' state .",
    "this state seems to retain remnants of helical order on intermediate time and length scales : neutron scattering experiments reveal a signal on the surface of a sphere in reciprocal space , which is resolution - limited in the radial direction but smeared out over the surface of the sphere @xcite .",
    "maxima of the signal now point into the @xmath1-directions but are no longer sharply peaked .    motivated by these experiments , we investigated ways of destabilizing helical order in chiral ferromagnets and the possible new phases that can exist besides helical order .",
    "such phases are well known for cholesteric liquid crystals@xcite , i.e.  chiral nematics , where several so - called blue phases have been observed . in these phases",
    "( more precisely in the phases i and ii ) crystalline order is formed which can be interpreted as a periodic network of ordered cylinders , see below .",
    "the lattice spacing is often of the order of a few hundred nanometers , leading to the colorful appearance of these phases ( including the color blue in some variants ) .    as the ginzburg - landau theory for the director of a chiral nematic",
    "liquid is very similar to that for the vector order parameter of a chiral magnet ( see discussion below ) , the question arises whether similar phases are realized in magnetic systems .",
    "this question has been addressed in some detail by wright and mermin@xcite many years ago .",
    "they showed that amplitude fluctuations , which are essential for the stability of blue phases , cost a factor @xmath2 more energy for ferromagnets compared to liquid crystals and concluded that such phases do not appear within a ginzburg landau theory with local interactions .",
    "motivated by the physics of mnsi , several groups have reexamined this issue .",
    "rler et al .",
    "@xcite added a further parameter to the ginzburg landau theory , allowing them to reduce the energy of amplitude fluctuations arguing that such a term might arise from higher - order fluctuation corrections .",
    "the term considered in ref .  [ ] is , however , non - analytic in the ginzburg - landau order parameter . in the presence of such a term",
    ", they were able to show that a crystalline array of cylinders can have lower energy than a uniform helix .",
    "we will discuss a similar structure below . an alternative route ( followed also by us ) to destabilize the helical solution",
    "are non - local interactions as suggested by binz _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "they considered crystals formed from superpositions of helices to be responsible for the partially ordered phase of mnsi .",
    "as pointed out by wright and mermin@xcite , is is useful to distinguish two rather different limits when investigating the physics of blue phases .",
    "here one has to compare the correlation length @xmath3 for amplitude fluctuations of the ordered state ( i.e. the width of a typical domain wall ) with the wavelength @xmath4 of the helical state . for @xmath5 , the high - chirality limit ,",
    "the magnetic structure can be described by a superposition of a few helices .",
    "this approach was taken by binz _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath6 is proportional to the strength of spin - orbit coupling@xcite and therefore expected to become large only very close to the second - order phase transition where @xmath3 diverges .",
    "as the pitch of the helix@xcite in mnsi , @xmath7 , is very large compared to all other microscopic length scales , we think that the low - chirality limit , @xmath8 , is more appropriate for the description of the high - pressure phase of this material . in this limit ,",
    "amplitude fluctuations of the order parameter cost more energy than twists of the phase and therefore one has to look for order - parameter configurations with as little amplitude fluctuations as possible .    in the following",
    "we will first investigate which terms in the ginzburg landau theory destabilize the helical state .",
    "then we will suggest variational solutions appropriate in the low - chirality limit .",
    "finally we investigate experimental consequences of the resulting structures .",
    "starting point of our investigation is a ginzburg - landau theory at finite temperature , assuming that all modes with non - zero matsubara frequencies are massive and can be integrated out .",
    "up to second order in spin - orbit coupling , the ginzburg - landau theory for chiral ferromagnets is given by @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the position - dependent magnetization and @xmath11 is the landau free energy of the underlying ferromagnet .",
    "spin - orbit coupling is present in the form of the dzyaloshinsky - moriya interaction @xmath12 . in order to facilitate the following discussion",
    ", we also provide a second form for ( [ fedensitysimple ] ) .",
    "it can be rewritten by setting @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the amplitude and @xmath15 is the direction of the magnetization @xmath16 : @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "terms that break rotational symmetry are of higher order in spin - orbit coupling and take the form e.g. @xmath19 \\\\",
    "+ b_2 \\left [ ( \\partial_x^2 { { \\bf \\boldsymbol m}})^2 + ( \\partial_y^2 { { \\bf \\boldsymbol m}})^2 +    ( \\partial_z^2 { { \\bf \\boldsymbol m}})^2 \\right ] \\\\ + b_3 ( m_x^4 + m_y^4 + m_z^4).\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] ( to fourth order in spin - orbit coupling ) for the point group p2@xmath203 of mnsi @xcite . these terms will be neglected for the moment .",
    "the helical state @xmath21 with @xmath22 can be shown to be the lowest energy state of ( [ fedensitysimple ] ) if one assumes that the amplitude @xmath14 of the magnetization is constant and was argued in ref .  [ ] to be the only ordered phase possible for chiral ferromagnets .",
    "higher order terms in the ginzburg - landau expansion can , however , serve to destabilize this helical order and induce other phases .",
    "the simplest ( i.e.  of lowest order in spin - orbit coupling ) of these terms will be the focus of our investigation in this paper : @xmath23 this term acts only on the amplitude of the magnetization , not on its direction . therefore , it gives no contribution to the free energy density in the helical phase , which has a uniform amplitude .",
    "if ( [ myterm ] ) has a negative prefactor , then in a certain parameter regime , it can be expected to destabilize helical order in favour of an order parameter with a fluctuating amplitude . in the following",
    "we will use the shorthand @xmath24 for the expression ( [ myterm ] ) .    in order to determine the new states that could be stabilized by ( [ myterm ] ) , it is instructive to explore the close analogies between chiral ferromagnets and chiral liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "the order parameter of chiral liquid crystals is a director , and as a consequence topological defects are fundamentally different in both systems .",
    "however , chiral liquid crystals can be described by a free energy density that is quite similar in form to ( [ enferro ] ) , the only differences being an additional cubic term in @xmath14 and an extra factor @xmath25 in front of the term @xmath26 .    _ locally _ , the blue phases are based on a configuration of the magnetization that can be shown to be even lower in energy than the helix : @xmath27 in cylinder coordinates , see fig .",
    "[ doubletwist ]",
    ". this can easily be seen@xcite by comparing the energy density of the uniform helix , @xmath28 , to the result obtained by plugging eq .",
    "( [ doubletwist ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ enferro ] ) : for @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the first two terms in ( [ enferro ] ) vanish for @xmath31 , and therefore the energy density at @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 , i.e. lowered by an extra factor @xmath33 .",
    "this so - called `` double - twist '' configuration is cylindrically symmetric : sheets of constant magnetization are rolled up around a common cylinder axis ( see fig .",
    "[ doubletwist ] ) .",
    "the configuration ( [ doubletwist ] ) is , however , only favoured in the vicinity of the cylinder axis  the energy difference between the helix and the double - twist configuration diminishes and even becomes positive as the distance from the cylinder axis is increased .",
    "isolated double - twist configurations therefore necessarily have to occur in the form of cylinders with an amplitude that becomes zero at a certain distance from the cylinder axis . however , amplitude fluctuations cost energy , as can be seen from the second term in ( [ enferro ] ) . in the case of liquid crystals ,",
    "the prefactor of @xmath34 is small enough for double - twist cylinders to become energetically lower in energy than the helix ( see discussion above ) .",
    "crystals made of these double twist cylinders are indeed believed to lie at the heart of the blue phases i and ii in liquid crystals @xcite . in the case of the ferromagnet ,",
    "however , the energy cost of amplitude fluctuations outweighs the energy gains due to directional fluctuations within the double - twist structure , and for a free energy density given by ( [ fedensitysimple ] ) ( single ) double - twist cylinders do not occur @xcite .    adding the term ( [ myterm ] ) to the free energy density can invalidate this conclusion : if the prefactor of ( [ myterm ] ) is allowed to become negative , it can reduce the cost of amplitude fluctuations and allow for the appearance of blue phases even in chiral ferromagnets .",
    "if ( [ myterm ] ) has a negative prefactor , then the inclusion of higher order terms in the ginzburg - landau theory becomes necessary in order to obtain a stable solution and avoid e.g.  an unbounded magnetization .    in the following ,",
    "we want to analyze the possible occurrence of the analogue of blue phases in chiral ferromagnets . by rescaling the magnetization , the free energy density and the momenta",
    ", the free energy density can be cast into the following form : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is a term containing @xmath38 powers of @xmath16 and @xmath39 derivatives ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) , which is used to stabilize solutions against an unbounded magnetization and oscillations thereof .",
    "possible choices are for example @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 . in the rest of this paper",
    ", we will use @xmath45 exclusively : this term is the one with the least number of derivatives and powers of @xmath16 that on the one hand stabilizes single double twist cylinders and on the other hand is identically zero for the single helix .",
    "as a first step , we investigated single double twist cylinders for @xmath46 . at this point ,",
    "the helical and isotropic phase are degenerate with @xmath47 .",
    "if a single cylinder can now be shown to have negative free energy , then the system can lower its free energy further by creating extended networks of double - twist cylinders : crystalline phases , the analogy to blue phases in liquid crystals , can be expected to form in chiral ferromagnets .",
    "setting @xmath48 , with @xmath49 given by ( [ doubletwist ] ) , we calculated numerically the amplitude function @xmath50 that minimizes the free energy density ( [ myfed ] ) ( for certain values of @xmath3 and @xmath51 ) , subject to the condition that the magnetization drops to zero at a certain distance from the cylinder axis . for a given @xmath51 and sufficiently negative values of @xmath3 , single cylinders are stable configurations within a ginzburg - landau theory of the form ( [ myfed ] ) , see fig .",
    "[ amplitude ] . in order to minimize its free energy ,",
    "the system will try to produce many such cylinders , packed as tightly as possible . in these configurations ,",
    "the magnetization only has to drop to zero on lines or points , if at all .",
    "considering that it is the competition between phase and amplitude fluctuations that either stabilizes double - twist structures or not , it can be expected that crystalline arrangements of the helices can exist even in parameter regimes where single cylinders are unstable .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the possible crystalline structures are subject to the condition that the magnetization matches where cylinders touch , in order to avoid discontinuities in the magnetization .",
    "this condition is much more restrictive for ferromagnets compared to liquid crystals@xcite .",
    "we have found@xcite only two allowed structures constructed as networks of double - twist cylinders : a square and a cubic lattice , see fig .",
    "[ crystals ] .",
    "the square lattice is invariant with respect to rotations by multiples of @xmath52 around the z - axis , translations along the z - axis as well as a translation by @xmath53 combined with time reversal ( @xmath54 ) . in this structure ,",
    "the magnetization has to go to zero on the line @xmath55 and symmetry - equivalent lines .",
    "the symmetry transformations that leave the second structure ( cubic lattice ) invariant are cyclic permutations of the axes and a translation by @xmath56 combined with time reversal . in this structure ,",
    "the magnetization vanishes only at @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and symmetry - equivalent points in the unit cell .",
    "we calculated the free energy density of these structures by means of a variational ansatz for the amplitude of a single double - twist cylinder : @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 and the double - twist wave vector @xmath62 are variational parameters .",
    "this ansatz is based on the numerics for a single cylinder .",
    "the cylinders were then arranged in crystals as shown in fig .",
    "[ crystals ] .",
    "the cutoff @xmath63 was chosen for convenience to avoid within the calculation the tiny overlap of cylinders which are far apart .",
    "a phase diagram as a function of the remaining three free parameters can now be computed . here , we set @xmath51 to a fixed value , assuming that it is the least susceptible to variations of external pressure , and established the phase diagram as a function of the two remaining free parameters . the result for @xmath64 can be seen in fig .",
    "[ phasedia ] .",
    "one immediately notices that there is no parameter regime in which the square lattice shown in fig .",
    "[ crystals ] ( a ) has the lowest free energy density ; this is also true for different values of @xmath51 not shown here .",
    "while the filling fraction of double - twist regions is certainly larger in the square lattice than in the cubic structure , the magnetization in the cubic crystal only has to go to zero at points and not on lines , as it is the case for the square lattice .",
    "furthermore , in the cubic lattice the magnetization only has to twist outwards by 45 degrees until cylinders touch , compared to 90 degrees in the case of the square lattice ( see fig .  [ crystals ] ) .",
    "these factors conspire to make the free energy of the cubic structure even lower than that of the square lattice . within our variational ansatz",
    "we find that the transition from the crystalline to the isotropic phase is very weakly first order [ the relevant free energy differences are less than @xmath65 in units of eq .",
    "( [ myfed ] ) ] .",
    "note , however , that our analysis might break down close to the transition , as one enters the high - chirality regime , see above .",
    "since the double twist wave vector @xmath62 is now also a variational parameter , it is no longer necessarily identical to the helix wave vector @xmath66 . in fig .",
    "[ wavevector ] we show that @xmath62 depends considerably on the microscopic parameters but remains of order @xmath66 .",
    "what signal can these structures be expected to produce in neutron scattering experiments ? as for any crystal , peaks in neutron scattering",
    "originate from the lattice structure itself , and the configuration of the magnetization within the wigner - seitz cell only enters in the shape of form factors .",
    "the lattice constants are functions of the double - twist wave vector and determined by the requirement that the magnetization has to match where cylinders touch . for the square lattice ,",
    "one obtains @xmath67 , and for the cubic lattice @xmath68 .    in neutron scattering , higher order bragg peaks can also be expected to be be generated by the lattice structures .",
    "the elastic scattering crossection@xcite can be calculated from a fourier transform of the magnetization : @xmath69 in order to compare with experimental data , the quantities of interest are the positions of the bragg peaks and the relative intensities of the bragg peaks .    for the square lattice , normalizing intensities to give unity for the first reflection with miller indices @xmath70",
    ", the @xmath71 and the @xmath72-reflections have intensities 0.08 and 0.01 , respectively .",
    "the invariance of the square lattice with respect to a translation by @xmath73 combined with @xmath54 constrains all bragg peaks @xmath74 with @xmath75 to vanish . in the case of the square lattice ,",
    "the lowest order reflexes already account for 84% of the total intensity .    for the cubic lattice , assuming that the lowest bragg peak , i.e.  the @xmath76-peak , has intensity 1.0 , the @xmath77- and @xmath78-peaks have relative intensities 0.17 and 0.03 .",
    "the @xmath79- , and @xmath80-peaks vanish for symmetry reasons , while the @xmath81-peak vanishes as a consequence of our ansatz based on a linear combination of cylinders in @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 direction , and should really be non - zero as allowed by symmetry",
    ". our approach suggests , however , that these peaks have small weight .",
    "the @xmath85-peaks of the cubic lattice only represent 46% of the total scattering intensity @xmath86 .",
    "the @xmath87- , @xmath88- and @xmath89-peaks of the cubic lattice add up to 79% of @xmath86 .",
    "anisotropic terms that orient the helix also act on the crystalline structures and determine their orientation with respect to the crystal lattice of the substance .",
    "for the square lattice , where all cylinders are arranged in parallel , we find using eq .",
    "( [ anisotropic ] ) for @xmath90 , @xmath91 that weak anisotropic terms align the cylinder axes parallel to the preferred direction of the helix vector , i.e. either in the @xmath0 or @xmath76 direction , depending on the sign of @xmath92 .",
    "however , the orientation of the crystal in perpendicular direction is not affected to leading order by the anisotropy term , but higher - order terms would lock a perfect crystal . motivated by the `` partial order '' observed in the high - pressure phase of mnsi ( see introduction ) , we investigate the expected signature in neutron scattering assuming that these higher - order terms are not effective . in this case , the square lattice will produce rings in planes normal to the @xmath93-direction ( the orientation of the helix in the low - pressure phase ) .",
    "these rings intersect to produce maxima in the @xmath94-direction on a circle with radius @xmath95 in reciprocal space . for parameters with @xmath96 ,",
    "this is consistent with the observed signatures@xcite in neutron scattering .",
    "note , however , that at least within our model , the square lattice never has the lowest energy .    in ref .",
    "[ ] , it was argued that an amorphous texture of parallel cylinders ( which the authors called skyrmions ) aligned preferentially along the @xmath97 direction would also produces such rings .",
    "however , such a scenario would not explain the resolution limited width in radial direction , i.e. at least on length scales of 2000  the square crystal would have to remain intact .",
    "in the case of the cubic lattice , the numerical calculation of the free energy density shows that for @xmath98 the anisotropic terms are minimized if one of the axes of the cubic lattice is @xmath99 and the other axes are @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively . while such structures would produce peaks in the @xmath79 direction ( as observed in the high - pressure phase of mnsi ) , one expects also considerable intensity rather close to @xmath102 ( as e.g.   @xmath103 differs only by about 10 degrees from @xmath104 ) .",
    "experimentally , however , one observes a minimum of the intensity in the @xmath102 direction . for @xmath90 , @xmath105 , the system would prefer to align the cubic structure with the crystal lattice of mnsi .",
    "binz et al .",
    "@xcite have argued that the bragg peaks in neutron scattering should be smeared out because the magnetization has a varying amplitude and is therefore susceptible to interactions with non - magnetic impurities .",
    "the same argument would apply for the crystalline structures presented in this paper .",
    "in conclusion , we have constructed `` blue phases '' in chiral ferromagnets .",
    "is it likely that these blue phases are realized in mnsi ?",
    "the signatures in neutron scattering seem to be consistent with the square structure ( also considered in ref .  [ ] ) , which is , however , never the ground state within the models which we considered .",
    "our results suggest that the intensity in neutron scattering is located on rings intersecting in the @xmath106-direction",
    ". it would be interesting to check experimentally whether the intensity distribution arising from such a picture fits quantitatively .    in the case of the cubic lattice",
    ", the positions of the expected maxima do not match the ones observed . in any case",
    ", the smoking gun experiment to detect crystalline structures , would be the observation of higher order bragg peaks ( this applies also for other structures , e.g. those suggested in refs .",
    "[ ] ) and we hope that our estimates may guide future experiments in this direction .    however , it is still unclear whether the partially ordered state of mnsi is indeed a separate phase .",
    "recent measurements of the thermal expansion coefficient give no trace of a phase transition from the partially ordered state to the isotropic phase@xcite . furthermore",
    ", @xmath107sr experiments@xcite give no evidence for static order in this regime and it remains unclear on which time scales the partial order survives@xcite .",
    "it therefore remains an open question whether distinct phases other than the helical one are present in chiral ferromagnets that are currently investigated experimentally .",
    "in fact , the partially ordered phase in mnsi might be more analogous to the blue phase iii than to blue phases i and ii . while the precise structure of the blue phase iii is not completely clear , it seems to show some type of crystalline short range order but is a liquid on long length scales@xcite",
    ". therefore it has been conjectured @xcite that an amorphous arrangement of double - twist cylinders is relevant for this blue phase iii in liquid crystals  this might also be true@xcite for the partially ordered phase in mnsi .                      although the three - dimensional structures proposed in ref .",
