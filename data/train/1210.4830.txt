    "accelerated particles with power - law spectra are a nearly universal feature of heliospheric plasmas and also characterize the cosmic ray spectrum .",
    "anomalous cosmic rays ( acrs ) @xcite , super - alfvnic ions in the solar wind @xcite and the hardest energetic electron spectra in flares @xcite all have energy fluxes with power - laws that depend on energy @xmath0 approximately as @xmath1 .",
    "an important question is whether there is a common acceleration mechanism in these very disparate environments .",
    "a range of acceleration mechanisms have been proposed to explain the spectra of energetic electrons ( up to several @xmath4 ) and ions ( up to several @xmath5 ) in impulsive flares , including the reconnection process itself and reconnection - driven turbulence @xcite .",
    "significant challenges have been to explain the large numbers of accelerated electrons and the surprising efficiency of the conversion of magnetic energy to the energetic particles @xcite .",
    "the single x - line model of reconnection in flares , in which electrons are accelerated by parallel electric fields , can not explain the large number of accelerated electrons @xcite .",
    "on the other hand both observations @xcite and modeling @xcite suggest that reconnection in flares involves the dynamics of large numbers of x - lines and magnetic islands or flux ropes . in magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd )",
    "simulations of multi - island reconnection test particles rapidly gain more energy than is available in the driving magnetic field @xcite .",
    "thus , developing a model of particle acceleration in a multi - island reconnecting environment with feedback on the driving fields is the key to understanding flare - produced energetic particle spectra .",
    "the seed population of acrs are interstellar pickup particles since their composition matches that of interstellar neutrals @xcite .",
    "however , the conventional idea that they are accelerated at the termination shock ( ts)@xcite was called into question when the voyagers crossed the ts and found that the intensity of the acr spectrum did not peak there @xcite .",
    "a possible alternate source is magnetic reconnection of the sectored heliosheath @xcite .",
    "simulations of reconnection in the sectored field region revealed that the dominant heating mechanism was fermi reflection in contracting and merging islands @xcite . because contraction increases the energy parallel to the local magnetic field and reduces the perpendicular energy , the heating mechanism drives the system to the firehose stability boundary @xmath6 where reconnection is throttled because the magnetic tension drive is absent @xcite .    while multi - island simulations have revealed that fermi reflection in contracting islands controls energy gain and drives the system to the marginal firehose condition , a rigorous model for particle acceleration in such a multi - island system has not yet been developed .",
    "the parker equation does not describe particle acceleration in nearly incompressible systems @xcite and extensions do not account for the geometry of reconnection and island merging @xcite . in the present manuscript we explore particle acceleration in a bath of merging magnetic islands with a particle distribution function",
    "@xmath7 that accounts for the velocity space anisotropy along ( @xmath8 ) and across ( @xmath9 ) the local magnetic field and includes a phenomenological pitch - angle scattering operator .",
    "thus , the pressure anisotropy can be directly evaluated and the feedback on island merging calculated .",
    "we develop a probabilistic model of particle acceleration in a bath of merging 2-d magnetic islands with a distribution of magnetic flux @xmath10 and area @xmath11 given by @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the development of structure in 3-d may ultimately be important and should be addressed but observations @xcite and simulations @xcite suggest that at the largest scales reconnection is nearly 2-d and this limit is therefore a reasonable starting point .",
    "we first calculate the particle energy gain during the merging of two circular islands of radii @xmath13 and @xmath14 with @xmath15 as shown in the schematic in fig .",
    "[ islandmerger ] .",
    "merging leads to a single island of area @xmath16 and with magnetic flux @xmath17 given by the larger of @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the reduction of energy by the factor @xmath20 results from the shortening of the field lines as merging proceeds .",
    "thus , energy release takes place not at the merging site , but as reconnected field lines contract after merger .",
    "as long as the kinetic - scale , boundary layer where reconnection occurs is small compared with the island radii , the dominant energy exchange with particles takes place on the closed , reconnected field lines that release magnetic energy as they contract .",
    "we take advantage of two adiabatic invariants , the magnetic moment @xmath21 and the parallel action @xmath22 , which are constants if the gyration time of particles around the local magnetic field and their circulation time around islands are short compared with the merging time .",
    "the former describes the reduction in @xmath9 as @xmath23 decreases and the latter the increase in @xmath8 as @xmath24 decreases .",
    "the parallel action invariant is valid for velocities that exceed the local alfvn speed , which implies that a seed heating mechanism is needed for low @xmath25 systems such as the solar corona @xcite but not in high @xmath25 systems such as the sectored heliosheath . to calculate @xmath26 , we first calculate the merging velocity @xmath27 of two islands with differing radii and magnetic fields , @xmath28 , since merging magnetic islands reconnect their magnetic flux at the same rate .",
    "the reconnection rate is given by @xcite , @xmath29 , with @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the normalized rate of reconnection and @xmath32 .",
    "thus , @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the island merging velocity .",
    "the rate of line shortening can now be calculated from the total merging time @xmath35 and the difference between the intial field line length as merging starts and the final length using area conservation , @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "parallel action conservation then yields an equation for @xmath8 , @xmath38 to obtain the corresponding equation for @xmath39 , we use the conservation of magnetic flux and area as a flux tube contracts so that @xmath40 is constant . therefore , from @xmath41 conservation @xmath42 is also constant and @xmath43 thus , the perpendicular energy goes down during island merger as the parallel energy increases .",
    "from the energy gain of particles in merging islands we can formulate a model of particle acceleration in a very long current layer of length @xmath44 .",
    "particles are injected into the bath of interacting islands in the current layer from upstream as each individual island grows due to reconnection of the upstream field .",
    "they then undergo acceleration in the merging islands until they are convectively lost .",
    "the rate of injection of particles is given by the upstream distribution function @xmath45 times the integrated rate of area increase of all of the magnetic islands",
    "@xmath46 @xcite , @xmath47 with the island radius given by @xmath48",
    ". the probability of two islands of radii @xmath13 and @xmath14 merging is given by their overlap probability @xmath49 .",
    "using the conservation of phase space volume and summing over all merging islands in the layer , we obtain a differential equation for @xmath50 , @xmath51 where @xmath52 with @xmath53 . in earlier simulations of multi - island reconnection strong pressure anisotropy with @xmath54 within the core of merging islands was limited by anisotropy instabilities @xcite",
    "so we have included a phenomenological pitch - angle scattering operator of strength @xmath55 that acts on the angle @xmath56 to reduce anisotropy .",
    "importantly , the drive @xmath57 is independent of the particle velocity .",
    "it depends on the pressure anisotropy through the merging velocity @xmath34 .",
    "the integral over islands includes only interactions for which @xmath34 is real ( @xmath58 ) . to estimate the scaling of @xmath57 we note that @xmath59 is the total number of islands in the layer , so for densely packed islands we can define a characteristic island radius @xmath60",
    "thus , @xmath61 . of course , @xmath57 can be much smaller if @xmath62 in the expression for @xmath34 approaches zero .",
    "if @xmath63 were isotropic and therefore only a function of @xmath64 , the energy drive operator in eq .",
    "( [ fequation ] ) would vanish when averaged over the angle @xmath65 . in this limit",
    "there is zero net energy gain , consistent with parker s equation in the incompressible limit @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ fequation ] ) is an equi - dimensional equation and therefore has no characteristic velocity scale .",
    "solutions therefore take the form of power - laws .",
    "an important property of such an equation is that the fluid moments of a given order completely decouple from those of differing order and their solutions can therefore be readily obtained from eq .",
    "( [ fequation ] ) in closed form .",
    "specifically an equation for @xmath66 and @xmath67 can be obtained so that @xmath62 in the energy drive @xmath57 can be evaluated explicitly .",
    "thus , the feedback of energetic particles on the dynamics of reconnection can be computed . in the case of no source ,",
    "sink or scattering , for example , eq .",
    "( [ fequation ] ) yields @xmath68 and @xmath69 so that @xmath66 and @xmath67 increase and decrease in time , respectively , but the total energetic particle pressure @xmath70 increases , @xmath71 .    instead of directly evaluating the full moments of eq .",
    "( [ fequation ] ) , we simplify the equation by ordering the magnitudes of the rates @xmath57 , @xmath55 and @xmath72 . since the scattering represented by @xmath55 arises from the pressure anisotropy driven by contraction , we argue that @xmath73 . on the other hand as the spectrum begins to saturate at firehose marginal stability @xmath57 is reduced and @xmath55 increases .",
    "we therefore take @xmath74 , where the latter follows because @xmath75 .",
    "the large @xmath55 assumption allows us to solve eq .",
    "( [ fequation ] ) by expanding @xmath63 in a series of legendre polynomials @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the @xmath78th order legendre polynomial . by the symmetry in @xmath8 , @xmath79 is zero .",
    "the equation for @xmath80 follows from balancing the reconnection drive acting on @xmath81 with the scattering operator acting on @xmath82 , @xmath83 . by averaging eq .",
    "( [ fequation ] ) over @xmath65 , the scattering term vanishes and the energy drive term acting on @xmath82 yields an equation for @xmath84 , @xmath85 this equation is again of equi - dimensional form and has power - law solutions whose individual moments can be calculated .",
    "evaluating the density in steady state , for example , by integrating over velocity , the drive term vanishes and the total number of particles undergoing acceleration @xmath86 is given by @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the integrated area of all of the islands in the layer .",
    "the firehose parameter needs to be self - consistently evaluated and for this we need @xmath89 using the expression for @xmath80 and noting that @xmath90 , we obtain @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the isotropic pressure calculated from @xmath81 , @xmath93 the firehose parameter becomes @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the average island magnetic field strength based on the sum in eq .",
    "( [ rdrive ] ) .",
    "a key feature of eq .  ( [ fh ] ) is its singular behavior when @xmath96 .",
    "this singularity can be understood from the power - law solutions to @xmath81 , which describe its behavior at energies greater than that of the source @xmath97 .",
    "taking @xmath98 , from eq .",
    "( [ f0equation ] ) we obtain @xmath99 so that when @xmath100 , @xmath101 .",
    "the second solution , @xmath102 , corresponds to divergent behavior and must be rejected .",
    "the singularity in eq .",
    "( [ fh ] ) therefore arises when @xmath103 and corresponds to a divergence of the pressure integral .",
    "thus , it is clear that the requirement that the pressure be bounded requires that @xmath104 or @xmath105 . in deriving eq .",
    "( [ f0equation ] ) for @xmath81 we have assumed large scattering so that @xmath106 . on the other hand , since island contraction drives the anisotropy , we argued previously that @xmath107 .",
    "thus , @xmath108 .",
    "namely , the acceleration rate should always exceed the system convective loss rate since @xmath44 is much larger than the characteristic island size .",
    "the resulting divergence of the pressure can only be avoided if the reconnection drive @xmath109 is reduced by its approach to firehose marginal stability , which forces @xmath110 . unless @xmath111 is very large , the only way that the firehose condition in eq .",
    "( [ fh ] ) can be reached is if @xmath112 or @xmath113 and @xmath103 .",
    "the total energy content @xmath114 of this high energy tail can be directly calculated from the pressure in eq .",
    "( [ p0 ] ) using @xmath115 and @xmath116 , @xmath117 thus , depending on the level of scattering , the total energy density of the energetic particles is of the order of , or somewhat greater than , the remaining magnetic energy . in a system with low initial @xmath25 equipartition between energetic particles and magnetic field",
    "is energetically accessible . in a system with high initial @xmath25 equipartition",
    "can only be reached if the system is open such that energetic particles can access additional sources of magnetic free energy .",
    "we have derived a general equation ( eq .",
    "( [ fequation ] ) ) for particle acceleration in a bath of merging magnetic islands in a large 1-d current layer .",
    "we demonstrated that the @xmath1 spectrum is a nearly universal feature of a multi - island reconnecting system for all values of initial @xmath25 as long as the nominal acceleration time of energetic particles is shorter than their loss rate .",
    "this is the correct limit as long as the characteristic magnetic island radius is much smaller than the system scale size @xmath44 .",
    "we argue therefore that the widely observed @xmath1 spectrum in the heliosphere is a natural consequence of multi - island reconnection .",
    "the total energy content of this @xmath1 spectrum reaches parity with the remaining magnetic field energy in the system .",
    "equation ( [ fequation ] ) can be readily generalized to a 2-d system by replacing the factors @xmath118 by @xmath119 in the drive term @xmath57 .",
    "the estimate for the scaling of @xmath57 is unchanged .",
    "the model loss term @xmath120 should also be replaced by the convective loss rate @xmath121 with @xmath122 the convective velocity of the system .",
    "the arguments leading to the @xmath123 also apply to the 2-d equations . in a system",
    "in which the driver @xmath57 is spatially non - uniform the 2-d version of eq .",
    "( [ fequation ] ) could then be numerically solved for the spatial distribution of energetic particles from reconnection .",
    "the impact of the finite structure of magnetic islands that might develop in the third direction remains an important open issue @xcite .",
    "there have now been several published simulations of particle acceleration and associated spectra in 2-d multi - current layer systems @xcite .",
    "we can compare the spectra predicted from our equation with the results of those simulations .",
    "since the simulations were doubly periodic , there was no convective loss .",
    "further , the pressure anisotropy was strong so we consider the non - scattering limit of eq .",
    "( [ fequation ] ) in which the source and loss terms are discarded . the exact solution for @xmath63",
    "is given by @xmath124 where @xmath125 .",
    "this is consistent with exponential growth of the effective parallel temperature and an exponential decrease in the perpendicular temperature .",
    "the omnidirectional distribution function can be computed numerically for any specified initial distribution function for comparison with simulation data .",
    "the comparison is made with a system with sixteen initial current layers in a @xmath126 domain , where @xmath127 is the ion inertial length @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ islands ] we show the magnetic field strength at late time ( @xmath128 ) in the simulation after islands on adjacent current layers have overlapped .",
    "the typical island radius @xmath129 at this time is around @xmath130 . the characteristic acceleration rate @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the ion cyclotron frequency .",
    "reconnection remains strong for a total time of around @xmath133 when the pressure anisotropy shuts off reconnection .",
    "thus , the integrated acceleration rate is @xmath134 .",
    "the comparison between the model and the simulation data is shown in fig .",
    "[ energy ] . the particle energy spectrum from the simulation",
    "is shown in the initial state and at @xmath135 in the solid lines .",
    "note that the initial state is not a simple maxwellian because of the shift in the ion velocity distribution that is required in the current layers .",
    "the fit of the initial spectrum with a single maxwellian , shown in the dot - dashed line in fig .  [ energy ] therefore matches the low energy portion of the spectrum very well but underestimates the number of particles at high energy .",
    "the late time energy spectrum from the solution given in eq .  ( [ tequation ] ) , after integration over the angle @xmath65 is given by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ energy ] .",
    "the best fit corresponds to @xmath136 rather than the estimate of @xmath137 .",
    "the model reproduces the overall late - time energy spectrum very well but modestly overestimates the number of particles in the high energy tail .",
    "this is probably because the ions in the initial spectrum have thermal speeds that are sub - alfvnic so the fermi acceleration of the low energy ions is delayed until they gain sufficient energy in reconnection exhausts @xcite .",
    "observations in the quiet solar wind have revealed that the super - alfvnic ions display an @xmath138 distribution @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that solar wind turbulence would be dissipated in reconnection current layers @xcite and therefore that reconnection is an important dissipation mechanism in the turbulent solar wind .",
    "solar wind observations also reveal that the pressure anisotropy bumps against the firehose threshold in some regions and that there are enhanced magnetic fluctuations at these locations @xcite",
    ". there are therefore mechanisms in solar wind turbulence driving anisotropy and the anisotropy is limited by enhanced scattering .",
    "finally , the direct observations of reconnection events in the solar wind reveal heating but no localized regions of energetic particles @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with our picture that the energetic particle spectrum is not produced at a single x - line but requires that the ions interact with many reconnection sites .",
    "the spectrum of energetic electrons in impulsive flares are not measured _ in situ _ and must be inferred from chromospheric x - ray emission .",
    "nevertheless , the energetic particle fluxes do occasionally reveal spectra as hard as @xmath1 , which corresponds to @xmath139 @xcite . in recent over - the - limb observations of flares in which the reconnection region high in the corona can be directly diagnosed , it was found that all of the electrons in the acceleration region became part of the energetic component , indicating that all electrons in the region of energy release underwent acceleration @xcite , which is consistent with our model .",
    "the @xmath25 of these electrons was of order unity , which is also consistent with our predictions .",
    "whether the sectored heliosheath magnetic field has reconnected remains an open issue because the voyager magnetometers are at the limits of their resolutions at the magnetic field strengths in the heliosheath @xcite .",
    "large drops in the energetic electron and acr population as voyager 2 exited from the sectored zone are consistent with reconnection as the acr driver @xcite .",
    "the spectral index of the acr particle flux measured at voyager 1 is slightly above @xmath140 @xcite .",
    "further , the integrated energy density of the measured acr spectrum between @xmath141 and @xmath142 and is comparable to that of the magnetic field , which has a magnitude of around @xmath143 .",
    "this is again consistent with the predictions of our model .",
    "the equations presented here were derived in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "however , the ideas can be easily extended to the case where the particles are relativistic but where reconnection itself is non - relativistic .",
    "we express the distribution of particles in terms of the particle momentum @xmath144 . for the pressure integral to remain bounded @xmath145 for power - law distributions with @xmath146 .",
    "the resulting particle flux per unit energy interval @xmath147 is given by @xmath148 .",
    "thus , the spectrum of the flux in the strongly relativistic limit should scale as @xmath149 ."
