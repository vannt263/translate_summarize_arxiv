    "transport coefficients determine the strength of currents in response to an external field ( _ i.e. _ , `` conductivities '' ) , or vice versa ( `` resistivities '' ) , in the linear response regime .",
    "a famous example is ohm s law , which relates the current density to the electric field through the electrical conductivity .",
    "the determination of transport coefficients is an important aspect of computational materials science , intriguing examples include thermal transport in nanostructures  @xcite , quantum liquids  @xcite , and two - dimensional materials  @xcite ; and charge transport in disordered media  @xcite .",
    "there are two fundamental possibilities for the calculation of transport coefficients .",
    "first , one can perform explicit non - equilibrium simulations in which a system is driven by an external field or non - conservative force . measuring the average current as a function of driving strength then allows to extract the transport coefficient from the initial linear slope .",
    "two drawbacks of this approach are : ( i )  the dependence on the finite size of the simulated system , which often requires some sort of extrapolation in order to determine bulk properties  @xcite and ( ii )  smaller fields lead to larger errors . in principle one",
    "can control either the field ( `` thvenin '' ensemble ) or the current ( `` norton '' ensemble ) , but typically one of these two can be implemented more easily .",
    "for example , for brownian dynamics and linear shear flow it is straightforward to add the velocity profile to the equations of motion and thus to simulate at constant strain rate ( _ viz . _",
    "constant current ) . simulating at constant stress might offer new physical insights  @xcite , but requires some sort of feedback or `` constrained simulations ''  @xcite . while equilibrium properties are defined by the boltzmann factor and thus energies ,",
    "the situation is different for dynamics breaking detailed balance since the characteristics of the ensuing non - equilibrium steady state do depend on these dynamics .",
    "this makes it desirable to not tamper with the dynamics .",
    "the second approach is to exploit the fact that thermal fluctuations encode the response of a system to a small change of external conditions .",
    "this is well known from statistical mechanics , _",
    "e.g. _ , the specific heat , as a material property , determines the amount of heat flowing in response to a change of temperature .",
    "the extension to transport coefficients goes back to seminal work by onsager  @xcite , which is mostly known for his reciprocal relations .",
    "arguably even more important is that this symmetry of transport coefficients is due to the existence of a potential , which allows to extent concepts from thermodynamics to the linear response regime ( and even to non - equilibrium steady states  @xcite ) . through this potential",
    "one identifies pairs of conjugated intensive field ( also called generalized force or affinity ) @xmath0 and extensive `` distance '' @xmath1 .    despite onsager s work ,",
    "the prevalent view on transport coefficients is a dynamic one .",
    "the starting point is the explicit dynamics of the system , which is perturbed through switching on an external force .",
    "the linear deviation from equilibrium is calculated , which leads to green - kubo relations involving the integration over a two - point correlation function of fluxes  @xcite . in some cases these fluxes",
    "can be rewritten as a total derivative , which allows the green - kubo formula to be recast in terms of an einstein - helfand relation  @xcite .",
    "transport coefficients can then be determined either from moments evaluated at explicit boundaries  @xcite or in bulk implementing periodic boundaries  @xcite .",
    "here we are interested in onsager s thermodynamic formalism for systems that can be described through a coupling to an ( effective ) reservoir .",
    "the system is driven by `` draining '' the reservoir with a non - zero average rate of change for the extensive quantity .",
    "specifically , we consider a simple model system for colloidal ( nearly ) hard spheres moving in a solvent with overdamped brownian dynamics .",
    "this means that velocities remain equilibrated with the solvent temperature at all times even if the system is driven through shear flow .",
    "we illustrate the analogy with thermodynamics by first calculating the shear modulus for the solid at high densities , before going to lower densities at which the system fluidizes . the stress in a flowing suspensions is governed by the viscosity , which for a hard sphere fluid has been calculated first by alder _",
    "_ using the corresponding helfand moment  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , we calculate the viscosity from strain fluctuations stemming from coupling the suspension to a strain reservoir characterized by a constant stress .",
    "it is instructive to recall how ensembles arise in statistical mechanics  @xcite .",
    "an isolated system corresponds to the microcanonical ensemble , for which the extensive quantities ( energy @xmath2 , volume @xmath3 , particle number @xmath4 ,  ) are conserved and thus fixed with thermodynamic potential @xmath5 ( the microcanonical entropy ) .",
    "the derivatives @xmath6 define the intensive generalized forces .",
    "a second ensemble is constructed through dividing the total system with fixed @xmath7 into the system of interest holding a small amount @xmath1 and a _ reservoir _ with remainder @xmath8 .",
    "hence , @xmath1 is not conserved anymore but exchanged with the reservoir , which is an ideal construct with the property that the corresponding force @xmath0 remains constant .",
    "now consider an isolated system with two conserved quantities , the energy @xmath2 and some @xmath1 with entropy @xmath9 .",
    "coupling to a heat reservoir , the boltzmann factor for this canonical ensemble reads @xmath10 with energy @xmath11 depending on microstate @xmath12 , @xmath13 the inverse temperature @xmath14 of the heat reservoir , and free energy @xmath15 arising from the normalization .",

    "fig : res ] ) , we obtain the boltzmann factor @xmath16 with average @xmath17 response relations are then given by @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath20 with @xmath21 held fixed ) the two thermodynamic potentials @xmath22 and @xmath23 are related through a fenchel - legendre transform  @xcite .       and a strain reservoir at stress @xmath24 . if the system can not sustain a finite stress ( _ e.g. _ , because it is a fluid ) it",
    "will constantly remove strain @xmath25 from the reservoir , which we demand to remain at constant @xmath24 .",
    "the strain reservoir thus performs work that is dissipated into the heat reservoir , with the system attaining a non - equilibrium steady state . ]",
    "now suppose that the coupled system and reservoirs do not reach equilibrium anymore but the system is `` draining '' one reservoir .",

    "we assume that a steady state is reached in which time - translational invariance holds .    an elegant way to derive the fluctuation - dissipation theorem is the fluctuation theorem , which quite generally states that @xmath30  @xcite . expanding the exponential and truncating after the second order leads to @xmath31  @xcite . inserting eq .",

    "<S> we calculate both the shear modulus and the shear viscosity from strain fluctuations and show that they agree with direct calculations from strained and non - equilibrium simulations , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we find a dependence of the fluctuations on the coupling strength to the strain reservoir , which can be traced back to the discrete - time integration . </S>",
    "<S> these results demonstrate the viability of exploiting fluctuations of extensive quantities for the numerical calculation of transport coefficients . </S>"
