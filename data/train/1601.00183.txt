    "in order to explain the current acceleration of the universe , the fine - tuning problem of the value of @xmath5 and the cosmic coincidence problem , different alternative models have been proposed . in framing the question of the nature of dark energy",
    "there are two directions .",
    "the firts is to assume a new type of component of energy density , which may be a fluid of constant density or dynamic .",
    "the other direction is to modify the einstein s equations thinking that the metric is inappropriate or that gravity works differently on large scales .",
    "the observational tests are of great importance to discriminate between these scenarios @xcite .",
    "the holographic dark energy is one dynamical de model proposed in the context of quantum gravity , so called _ holographic principle _ , which arose from black hole and string theories @xcite .",
    "the holographic principle states that the number of degrees of freedom of a physical system , apart from being constrained by an infrared cutoff , should be finite and should scale with its bounding area rather than with its volume .",
    "specifically , it is derived with the help of tha entropy - area relation of thermodynamics of black hole horizons in general relativity , which is also known as the bekenstein - hawking entropy bound , i.e. , @xmath6 , where _ s _ is the maximum entropy of the system of length _",
    "l _ and @xmath7 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "this principle can be applied to the dynamics of the universe , where l may be associated with a cosmological scale and its energy density as :    @xmath8    if for example _",
    "l _ is the hubble s radius , which represents the current size of the universe , then @xmath9 represents the holographic dark energy density associated . +",

    "+ the friedmann equations for a spatially flat universe can be written as :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the energy density of the matter component and @xmath15 is the holographic dark energy density .",
    "these components are related by an interaction _ q _ term as :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the equation of state of the holographic dark energy density .",
    "the change rate of the hubble parameter can be written as :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the effective equation of state of the cosmic fluid and @xmath20 is the ratio of energy densities , which is related to the saturation parameter @xmath21 as @xmath22 , which establishes that energy in a box of size l should not exceed the energy of the black hole of the same size , under the condition @xmath23 .",
