    "the high - momentum components of the loop diagrams are suppressed ( here , through the presence of the charmed quark @xcite ) , leaving the low - mass on - shell states ( @xmath96 or @xmath182 , respectively ) to provide a good estimate of the matrix element .",

    "<S> a gluino in the mass range 1216 gev combined with a light ( 25.5 gev ) bottom squark , as has been proposed recently to explain an excess of @xmath0 quark hadroproduction , would affect the momentum - scale dependence ( `` running '' ) of the strong coupling constant @xmath1 in such a way as to raise its value at @xmath2 by about @xmath3 . </S>",
