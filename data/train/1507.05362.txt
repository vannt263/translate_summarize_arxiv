    "@xmath184 is scaled as @xmath218 if @xmath13 is odd , otherwise @xmath219 , and @xmath220 if @xmath13 is odd , otherwise @xmath221 . ]    in this paper we focus on one dimensional rings and two dimensional lattices .",
    "application of these results to three dimensional lattices can be easily extended . in that case , as a simplest example , we can consider local hamiltonian on single cubes with crossing bonds and it should be written as @xmath222 .",
    "lieb - schupp called fig .",
    "2-(b ) pyrochlore checkerboard since it is a two dimensional projection of a three dimensional pyrochlore lattice .",
    "but this framework is not applicable to the pyrochlore lattice unfortunately , because it lacks reflection symmetry .",
    "they also called equation ( [ icerule ] ) with @xmath125 quantum analogue of ice rule in the context of the correspondence between ising like ferromagnet with crystal field anisotropy on the pyrochlore lattice and configuration of four hydrogen atoms around an oxygen atom in ice.@xcite in that point of view equations ( [ icerule ] ) and ( [ ghb2 ] ) are generalization of ice rule to any even numbered frustrated units and @xmath223 pole moment higher than dipole .    in the following",
    "we shall comment on effects of crossing bonds on stability of the nel ordered phase and the ferroquadrupole ( spin nematic ) phase . as was illustrated in fig .",
    "3-(a ) , there exist the nel ordered phase and the ferroquadrupole phase which are separated by the line at @xmath224 . by adding antiferromagnetic crossing bonds to the square lattice ,",
    "it is clear that the nel order exhibiting anti - alignment of spin is not stable . on the other hand ,",
    "the quadrupole order is not alignment of spin but nematicity of spin , and from equation ( [ u ] ) it can be seen that @xmath225 with even @xmath13 is even parity with respect to time reversal .",
    "the ferroquadrupole order is uniformly aligned nematic and does not seem to be suffer from geometrical frustration .",
    "so stability of the ferroquadrupole phase is not affected by frustration due to antiferromagnetic crossing bonds unlike the nel ordered phase .",
    "now we set next nearest neighbor interactions @xmath226 and @xmath227 with @xmath228 , then fig .",
    "3-(a ) is expected to be changed as follows .",
    "phase boundary @xmath229 is unchanged by adding crossing bonds with ferromagnetic and ferroquadrupole interactions since the region @xmath230 is saturated ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "on the other hand , phase boundary @xmath231 closes to the antiferromagnetic heisenberg point as @xmath232 approaches @xmath233 , i.e. , by adding crossing bonds with antiferromagnetic and ferroquadrupole interactions , the ferroquadrupole phase becomes dominant and the nel ordered phase is suppressed if there do not exist different phases between these two phases . as for stability of the nel order , the triangular and pyrochlore lattices are slightly different situation from the square lattice with antiferromagnetic crossing bonds .",
    "the ground state phase diagrams of @xmath0 bilinear - biquadratic exchange model on the triangular and pyrochlore lattices are obtained in reference @xcite and the same situation in the above scenario is shown .",
    "finally we shall propose the physical realization of the ferroquadrupole phase in magnetic materials .",
    "usually biquadratic interaction is small as compared with bilinear interaction and the ferroquadrupole phase is unphysical in magnetic materials . in reference",
    "@xcite mila and zhang proposed a mechanism leading to a significant biquadratic interaction in @xmath0 systems as follows .",
    "the super exchange interaction between atoms with three orbitals and two outer electrons per atom , which consists of the two singly occupied doubly degenerate orbitals with the lowest energy and an unoccupied orbital with slightly higher energy .",
    "the virtual electron transition via the higher energy orbital favors ferromagnetic spin interaction , which compensates largely the antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction . as a result ,",
    "the biquadratic interaction becomes predominant relatively .",
    "thus we expect that highly frustrated antiferromagnetic materials with biquadratic exchange interactions originated from the mila - zhang mechanism may exhibit the ferroquadrupole phase .",
