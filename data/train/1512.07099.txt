    "quantum correlations are known to be capable of outperforming classical ones .",
    "while separable states can be perfectly correlated in one way at a time , entangled ones may reveal perfect correlations , say , whenever the same quantity is measured by two observers .",
    "this observation has lead to a serious debate about the most fundamental aspects of nature .",
    "first , einstein , podolsky , and rosen @xcite have asked if quantum mechanics can be supplemented with additional , hidden parameters , and later it was answered that if it was indeed so , these parameters would need to go beyond certain reasonable requirements , such as locality @xcite , or noncontextuality @xcite .",
    "the bell theorem @xcite has consequences of not only philosophical nature , but has also found applications in certain communication tasks . in particular , having a bell inequality violated by a quantum state is equivalent to an advantage in a distributed computing @xcite .",
    "specifically , if protocol users share an entangled state , they can achieve a higher probability of locally getting the correct value of a certain function than when they are allowed only to communicate classically .",
    "the role of the bell theorem has been also pointed out in the context of , e.g. , cryptography @xcite .",
    "therefore , schemes of entanglement detection have gathered a lot of attention for both fundamental and practical reasons .",
    "the task is very simple for pure states , which practically never occur in a real life .",
    "however , for mixed states it is still an open question .",
    "one method is to apply a positive , but not a completely positive map to one of subsystems @xcite .",
    "this should drive an entangled state out of the set of physically admissible density operators . by the jamiokowski - choi isomorphism @xcite",
    ", we can equivalently use an entanglement witness , a composite observable taking negative mean values only for entangled states . in this manner",
    ", we can certify all forms of entanglement , but we do not know all the non - completely positive maps . in order to make entanglement detection schemes more efficient , nonlinear criteria were introduced .",
    "they appeared also in particular context of necessary conditions on states to violate bell inequalities @xcite .",
    "a state can violate werner - wolf - weinfurter - ukowski - brukner inequalities only if ( but not necessarily if ) certain of its squared elements of the correlation tensor add up to more than 1 .",
    "a similar condition appeared in the context of so - called geometrical inequalities @xcite , which treat correlations of the system as multidimensional vector not belonging to a convex set of local realistic models .",
    "this approach resulted in geometrical entanglement criteria @xcite , which are highly versatile , and quadratic ones , particularly easy to construct @xcite .    up to date , these methods turn out to be successful mainly for collections of qubits , as their states are conveniently described by the means of the correlation tensor .",
    "the deficit of bell inequalities and entanglement criteria for higher - dimensional constituents of quantum systems follow also from our inability to generalize this tool .",
    "pauli matrices , the foundation of this achievement , have many interesting properties , each contributing to the success .",
    "they are hermitian , unitary , traceless , for individual subsystems their measurements are complete ( except for the unit matrix ) , meaning that the individual mean values contain the full information about the statistics of outcomes , and they have unbiased bases as their eigenbases .",
    "in contrast , one of the straight - forward generalizations , the gell - mann matrices , do not satisfy any commutativity relations .",
    "if we used them to create a correlation tensor , its elements would not be independent from one another .    in this contribution",
    "we show that the notions known for the formalism of the tensor product for multiqubit states can be straight - forwardly stretched to qutrits , when we associate complex root of infinity to local measurement outcomes .",
    "in particular , this generalized tensor product is a subject to linear and quadratic bounds .",
    "basing on these bounds , we can derive quadratic ( and geometrical ) entanglement criteria .",
    "for higher - dimensional systems , this is still an open challenge .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the success of describing and analyzing the states of many qubits is due to the particularly convenient representation through a correlation tensor .",
    "its elements are mean values of tensor products of pauli matrices , @xmath0 , @xmath1}\\otimes\\sigma_{i_2}^{[2]}\\otimes ... $ ] , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 operators @xmath4 form an orthonormal basis , @xmath5 .",
    "this orthogonality can have three different reasons . when either @xmath4 or @xmath6 is the unit matrix , the other operator is traceless .",
    "when @xmath4 and @xmath6 commute , but differ from each other and neither of them is the unit matrix , their eigenvalues are distributed in such a way that their product adds up to zero . finally , when they do not commute , they anticommute and their eigenbases can be chosen to be unbiased , i.e. , the scalar product between any vector from one basis and any one from the other is constant in modulo . for a given state @xmath7 ,",
    "let the correlation tensor be a set of averages @xmath8 .",
    "naturally , @xmath9 , but also for a single qubit we have the pronounced complementarity relation @xcite , @xmath10 this relation can be straight - forwardly generalized to any set of mutually anticommuting operators ( where @xmath11 is some set of multiindex values ) , @xmath12 notice that operators @xmath4 and @xmath6 anticommute iff superindices differ on odd number of positions , excluding those , where one superindex has `` 0 '' . in ref .",
    "@xcite this property was further generalized to cut - anticommutativity .",
    "namely , consider two operators , @xmath13}\\otimes o_1^{[b]}$ ] and @xmath14}\\otimes o_2^{[b]}$ ] .",
    "we say that they anticommute with respect to cut @xmath15 if they anticommute on either of the subsystem .",
    "consequently , @xmath16 for states , which are factorizable ( and , by convexity , thus separable ) with respect to the cut .",
    "this lead in ref .",
    "@xcite to constructing quadratic entanglement criteria based solely on anticommutativity properties of operators",
    ". the main goal of this contribution is to show that the formalism for qutrits can also be used for this purpose .",
    "we are now looking for a description of a qutrit , in which each measurement gives us a complete information about the probability distribution of three outcomes . to remove any dependencies",
    ", we expect the measurements on individual qutrits used for establishing the correlation tensor to be have mutually unbiased bases ( mubs ) as their eigenbases .",
    "lastly , since we want to formulate the complementarity relation similar to eq .",
    "( [ comp1 ] ) , so we expect the eigenvalues to be of modulo 1 . a family satisfying these requirements for three - dimensional subsystems are the heisenberg - weyl matrices .",
    "they are given as @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "first , let us show that this representation of a state is complete , that is , the data can be used for state tomography . as given in ref .",
    "@xcite , a state can be given as @xmath19 where @xmath20 enumerates the mutually unbiased basis , the eigenbasis of @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the @xmath23th state of this basis and @xmath24 .",
    "now , consider the following quantity : @xmath25 for simplicity , let us represent complex numbers and operators as vectors , i.e. , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "furthermore , let us denote 1,@xmath28 as @xmath29 .",
    "notice that this defines a new scalar product , which leads to @xmath30 the last equation can be plugged in to eq .",
    "( [ tomo1 ] ) .",
    "when the usual tensor product is used , this formula is extended by replacing products of probabilities with joint probabilities , @xmath31 .",
    "let us now consider the complementarity relations between tensor products of heisenberg - weyl operators . for certain noncommuting groups of operators , @xmath32 , we shall have @xmath33 the equivalent of which was one of the key ingredients of ref .",
    "@xcite for qubits .",
    "therein , this complementarity directly follows from the anticommutativity relations between the various pauli matrix tensor products . here , the situation is not as simple .",
    "the argument can not go through directly as heisenberg - weyl tensor product operators do not anticommute . still , we find some forms of complementarity between these operators . for an individual qutrit we shall have @xmath34 where the transition between the third and the fourth line comes from the parseval s theorem for the fourier transform .",
    "now , we are ready to consider the complementarity for many - qutrit operators . here",
    "our possibilities are quite limited .",
    "one would expect that as long as tensor products do not commute , the sum of squared moduli of their averages for any state would not exceed 1 .",
    "this is false , however .",
    "we have found 792 distinguished sets of seven mutually non - commuting two - qutrit operators , @xmath35 , and found that for all of them there exist states , for which @xmath36 .",
    "for the complete set of two - tensor products of heisenberg - weyl operators , from the semi - positivity of the state one can show that @xmath37 nevertheless , we can easily argue for the complementarity of a smaller set .",
    "in particular consider a pair of operators , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which do not commute with each other . by diagonalization one of them and",
    "a proper choice of phases of the new basis states we can bring to the @xmath40 block - diagonal form , where each of the blocks takes form @xmath41_{\\text{block}}= h_1,&\\nonumber\\\\ & [ o_2]_{\\text{block}}\\propto h_2&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the complementarity follows directly from eqs .",
    "( [ proof1 ] ) .",
    "in addition , one may have two more operators , the blocks of which correspond to @xmath42 @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xmath45 , up to global phases , extending the complementarity principle from two general to four specific operators .",
    "notice that the operation diagonalizing @xmath38 does not need to be local , so this complementarity is not of a strictly local nature",
    ".    we can now transplant the rest of ingridients from ref .",
    "@xcite to this consideration . obviously , if we have mutually commuting operators , it suffices to choose a common eigenstate of all of them , to have all the mean values equal to 1 .",
    "also , we can use the proof from the reference that in quadratic entanglement criteria , mixing states can not improve the situation .",
    "another fact we need for the construction is that for product states @xmath46}\\otimes\\rho_2^{[b]}$ ] and a multiqutrit operator in form @xmath47}\\otimes o_2^{[b]}$ ] , where @xmath48 $ ] and @xmath49 $ ] are subsystems , we have @xmath50}\\rangle|^2|\\langle \\vec{o}_2^{[b]}\\rangle|^2,\\ ] ] which , again follows directly from the correspondence between the two - dimensional vector eigenvalues and the complex root - of - unity eigenvectors .",
    "however , this relation fails for @xmath51 , when we replace the complex roots of unity as eigenvalues with @xmath52-vectors @xmath53 satisfying relation @xmath54 thus our method is applicable only for a collection of qutrits .",
    "consider the four - qutrit ghz state , which in the computational basis ( @xmath55 ) has form @xmath56 prefect correlations of this state include ( hereafter , we omit the tensor product signs ) @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes an arbitrary permutation of @xmath59 in terms of the tensor product .",
    "hence we can use the criterion @xmath60 to exclude separability with respect to bipartitions @xmath61 and @xmath62 , while the criterion @xmath63 can used to exclude separability between subsystems @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "additionally , both of these criteria are sensitive to all one - versus - three cuts .",
    "thus , a simultaneous violation of both of these inequalities certifies true multipartite entanglement of the tested state ( in principle , different from the ghz state ) .",
    "the next example is the four - qutrit cluster state , @xmath66 which gives us the following criterion for true four - qutrit entanglement : @xmath67 again , these four correlations can be , in principle established together , and while measuring in local mubs , it again takes only two series of measurements to establish all four of them .    to demonstrate the usefulness and convenience of our method ,",
    "let us consider four - qutrit graph states in general .",
    "imagine a collection of four qutrits , each initialized in state @xmath68 .",
    "now we take a graph , which connects four vertices .",
    "there are two such graphs with three edges ( a path and a three - arm star ) , two with four ( a loop and a triangle with a leg ) , one with five ( a loop with one diagonal ) and the complete graph has six edges .",
    "the graphs are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : graphs ] . if two qutrits are connected by an edge on the graph , we entangle them by applying a generalization of the control-@xmath11 operation ,     operation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : controlz ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath69    each four - qutrit graph state has a total of 80 perfect correlations for nontrivial tensor products of the @xmath70 operators .",
    "lists of these correlations have been made , and from them we choose triples of operators , which satisfy the following conditions : ( i ) their mean value for the reference state has the absolute value equal to 1 , ( ii ) for every bipartite cut , at least one pair does not cut - commute , ( iii ) they can be established in two measurement series .",
    "we came to the conclusion that the true four - partite entanglement is certified if @xmath71 notice that not all of these correlations are equal to 1 , but since the criteria are quadratic , this is no concern .",
    "we have shown a generalization of a derivation of graph - based quadratic entanglement criteria , known already for qubits , to qutrits .",
    "it was achieved by using heisenberg - weyl operators , which can be seen vector - valued observables . while the obtained criteria can be applied to a relatively small set of states , namely those with very strong correlations , they are easy to derive , compared to most other methods .",
    "one does not need to optimize over the whole set of product states , but simply find some pairs of correlations , that we expect to be simultaneously high .",
    "this was well demonstrated in case of four - qutrit graph states .",
    "there are some differences between the derivation presented in ref . @xcite and the above .",
    "therein , we enjoyed the complementarity relation for an arbitrarily large set of cut - anticomming operators . for qutrits , we have found counterexamples .",
    "the complementarity principle holds in general for pairs of ( cut-)noncommuting observables , and for more only in special cases .",
    "one still can , however , construct criteria such as those in ref .",
    "@xcite , involving only two terms each . for a given term",
    ", we take as many pairs as necessary to exclude separability of the state along all cuts .",
    "interestingly , we were not able to push the reasoning even further , to dimensions of subsystems higher than 3 .",
    "there are few obstacles in generalizing the proofs .",
    "one is that the proof of the complementarity relation ( eq .",
    "( [ comple ] ) ) explicitly refers to the heisenberg - weyl formalism , which consists of the shift operators .",
    "the other difficulty is that for vector eigenvalues , we were unable to derive a dependence between the length of the mean value of a joint observable and the lengths for local operators .",
