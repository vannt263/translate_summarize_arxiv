    "a superfluid - insulator transition in a disordered noninteracting system of bosons at zero temperature is a special type of quantum phase transition ( qpt ) @xcite . instead of the more conventional competition between different interactions , it is disorder that causes a drastic change in the nature of the ground state , thus altering the physical characteristics of the material .",
    "a similar type of transition from a metal to an insulator , usually called the anderson localization transition , was first proposed by anderson @xcite , and has been extensively studied in electronic systems @xcite . in general , the approach focus on the conductance behavior as the fermi level changes in the vicinity of the _ mobility edge _ , which separates localized and extended one - particle states . in this context , the lower critical dimension has been determined to be @xmath0 , which means that all the states are localized in one dimension for any finite amount of disorder .",
    "nevertheless , given that the states in a strictly non disordered system are extended , there is a clear change of regime when the disordered strength is reduced to zero , which can be characterized as a qpt .    in the past decade ,",
    "enormous progress in the techniques for creating ultracold atom systems in laboratory settings extended the interest in the disorder effects and localization to bosonic systems ( for recent reviews , see @xcite ) . for bosons ,",
    "the transition is from the _ insulator _ ( localized ) state to the superfluid one .",
    "it was observed both for laser - speckle disorder @xcite and quasiperiodic optical lattices @xcite in bose - einstein condensates of @xmath1rb and @xmath2k atoms , respectively . while speckle disorder comes close to the anderson - type",
    "_ random disorder _ considered in theoretical approaches , quasi - periodic lattices present a superposition of the lattice potential with an incommensurate one and can be viewed as experimental realizations of pseudo - disorder models like the aubry - andr ( aa ) model @xcite .",
    "the latter also shows superfluid and localized regimes in one dimension , but the transition between them occurs at a nonzero critical disorder @xcite .",
    "recently , we have investigated numerically the superfluid - insulator transition in one - dimensional , noninteracting systems of bosons with these two types of disorder @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the scaling properties of the superfluid fraction near the superfluid - insulator transition , obtaining the relevant critical exponents . for random disorder , even though the superfluid phase is destroyed for arbitrarily weak disorder , we show that the transition can still be described as a quantum critical phenomenon with well - defined critical exponents and power - law scaling behavior .",
    "the same happens for the aa model , but the universality classes are different .",
    "our starting point is a well - known scaling relation for the singular part of the superfluid density @xmath3 close to a quantum superfluid - insulator phase transition @xcite , @xmath4 where @xmath5 measures the distance to the quantum critical point ( qcp ) , @xmath6 is the correlation length exponent ( i.e. , the correlation length diverges as @xmath7 at the qcp ) , @xmath8 is the spatial dimension , and @xmath9 is the dynamic critical exponent associated with the qcp .",
    "the superfluid density is directly related to the _ helicity modulus _",
    "@xcite , and can be viewed as a measure of the system s response to a phase - twisting field .",
    "thus , it is natural to interpret the correlation length as a phase - coherence length . in the insulating phase",
    "it should coincide with the localization length , which measures the spatial extent of the wave functions .",
    "this holds also for disordered metals @xcite .    in a finite system , even at criticality ,",
    "the correlation length is limited by the system size @xmath10 , and the finite - size - scaling form of the superfluid density is @xmath11 the corresponding relation for the superfluid fraction ( @xmath12 ) is @xmath13 this last equation is suitable to determine the critical exponents @xmath6 and @xmath9 from a numerical evaluation of @xmath14 for various lattice sizes , as we do in the following .",
    "the usual hamiltonian describing interacting bosons on a lattice is known as the bose - hubbard hamiltonian , and is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the creation and annihilation operators of a boson at the lattice site @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the corresponding number operator , each site has a single bound state of energy @xmath20 , hopping between sites is restricted to nearest neighbors , with amplitude @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is a local repulsive interaction . in the rest of this paper , energies are measured in units of the tunneling amplitude @xmath21 .",
    "an anderson - like disorder @xcite is introduced by choosing random local energies with a uniform distribution in the range @xmath23 , so that @xmath24 is a measure of the disorder strength .",
    "we carried out a thorough numerical analysis of the above model for the non - interacting case in one spatial dimension .",
    "details of this numerical study are given in ref .",
    "we recall one of the main results reported there , namely that the superfluid fraction for a lattice of size @xmath10 obeys the relation @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a characteristic disorder strength for suppression of superfluidity , which scales with the lattice size as @xmath27 .",
    "this latter relation is consistent with the expected value of the critical disorder strength @xmath28 for destroying the superfluid phase in the thermodynamic limit for a one - dimensional system .",
    "furthermore , defining @xmath29 , this scaling of @xmath26 with @xmath10 is recognized as the finite - size version of the general relation @xmath7 , immediately yielding the correlation - length exponent @xmath30 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : sffscaling ] ) implies that @xmath31 is a universal function of @xmath32 . the corresponding plot of our data for different lattice sizes is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sffand ] , where it is clear that all the data collapse onto a universal curve . the appearance of @xmath33 alone as the scaling quantity in the vertical axis means that the dynamic critical exponent is @xmath34",
    ". the scaled variable of the horizontal axis in the collapsed plot confirms the value @xmath30 for the correlation - length exponent . actually , for the present problem , we are able to determine explicitly the scaling function @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sffscaling ] ) .",
    "the above mentioned expression for @xmath36 implies that @xmath37 . since @xmath38 , the value @xmath34 for the dynamic exponent implies a jump of the superfluid fraction from 0 to 1 at the transition occurring for @xmath39 in the limit @xmath40 .",
    "this jump is reminiscent of that of the helicity modulus in the two - dimensional @xmath41 model @xcite .    ) , the horizontal - axis variable for collapsed curves is @xmath42 , which gives @xmath30 , while the absence of any rescaling of @xmath33 implies that @xmath34 . ]",
    "the value @xmath30 obtained here for the correlation - length exponent has not been determined previously , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "this new exponent for the superfluid - insulator transition seems to violate the inequality @xmath43 , which holds for other disordered systems @xcite .",
    "however , this inequality has been proved only for interacting systems and for nonzero critical values of the parameter driving the transition , which is not the case here . on the other hand",
    ", the dynamic exponent @xmath34 implies that the effective dimension of the quantum phase transition @xcite is @xmath44 . for disordered interacting bosons ,",
    "the bose - glass - to - superfluid transition is characterized by the relation @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "therefore , interacting and noninteracting bosons are in different universality classes with respect to the localization transition . in the renormalization group language",
    ", interaction is a relevant term close to the disordered non - interacting fixed point .",
    "its fractal nature is illustrated in the bottom by expanding the small box drawn inside the middle panel .",
    "we show the spectrum for @xmath46 , which is the same as for @xmath47 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : harper ] ) . ]    the aubry - andr model can also be described by the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ham ] ) , with @xmath48 , except that the distribution of local energies is not random , but periodic with a period incommensurate with the lattice spacing .",
    "these energies are usually written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the golden ratio and @xmath18 assumes integer values from 1 to @xmath10 .",
    "this is actually a special case of the harper model @xcite for electrons in a two - dimensional lattice in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field , for which eq .",
    "( [ eq : harper ] ) holds for any value of @xmath47 , with different characteristics of the spectrum for rational or irrational values .",
    "disorder - like effects here are a consequence of the incommensurability between the `` external potential '' and the lattice .",
    "aubry and andr @xcite proved that for this model localization occurs only when the strength of the potential @xmath24 is larger than the critical value @xmath51 . for finite lattices , it is convenient to replace @xmath47 with @xmath52 , the ratio of two consecutive fibonacci numbers , whose limit for @xmath53 is the golden ratio .",
    "then , the lattice size must be chosen as @xmath54 in order to allow for the use of periodic boundary conditions .",
    "for this kind of finite lattices , the critical value @xmath51 remains a rigorous result @xcite , since it corresponds to a duality between the hamiltonians in position and momentum space .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the superfluid fraction undergoes a very sharp transition around @xmath55 for essentially all lattice sizes .",
    "this sharpness makes it difficult to directly extract the correlation - length exponent , as done for random disorder ( sec .",
    "[ sec : and ] ) . here , we concentrate on a narrow region around @xmath56 , searching for the appropriate scaling variable proportional to @xmath57 , and the appropriate scaling of the superfluid fraction .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sffaa ] .",
    "the data collapse onto two universal curves , for even and odd numbers of lattice sites .",
    "although the scaling functions are different for these two cases , the critical exponents for which the curves collapse are the same . in view of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sffscaling ] ) we immediately identify the correlation - length exponent @xmath58 from the @xmath59-axis scaling variable in fig .  [",
    "fig : sffaa ] , and the dynamic exponent @xmath60 from the @xmath61-axis scaling .",
    "it was already known @xcite that @xmath58 for this model .",
    "next we discuss the obtained value of @xmath9 in the light of properties of the energy spectrum .",
    "the spectrum of the harper model has been thoroughly studied in the past @xcite . for general rational values of @xmath47",
    "it is multifractal at @xmath55 , yielding the famous _ hofstadter butterfly _",
    "@xcite , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : btfly ] .",
    "there we highlight the case that we are studying here , with @xmath47 being a rational approximant of the golden ratio .",
    "in particular , the figure shows our result obtained from numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian for a lattice of size @xmath62 .",
    "the two bottom panels illustrate the fractal nature of this spectrum .    with our replacement of @xmath47 by a ratio of two fibonacci numbers , @xmath52 , the spectrum is equivalent to the one for @xmath63 , which contains @xmath64 bands and @xmath65 gaps .",
    "as discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , when @xmath66 the width @xmath67 of a given band belonging to the spectrum scales as @xmath68 , with different regions of the spectrum associated with different values of @xmath69 ( not to be confused with the susceptibility critical exponent ) .",
    "in particular , a maximum value @xmath70 corresponds to band - edge states . on the other hand ,",
    "the band width is a characteristic energy of the system and therefore should scale as @xmath71 , which means that @xmath72 .",
    "our finding of @xmath73 is in agreement with the relevant state for the zero - temperature superfluid - insulator transition being the bottom edge of the lowest - lying band .",
    "in the vicinity of the non - interacting qcp is essentially linear ( with a slope close to 0.1 ) implying that it is dominated by the analytic part @xmath74 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : uc_gen ] ) . ]    the interaction term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) can be treated as a relevant field close to the qcp .",
    "the knowledge of the dynamic exponent allows us to generalize the scaling relations close to the qcp for small but finite @xmath22 .",
    "the free energy , for example , is given by @xmath75 where again we used the fact that @xmath22 is an energy , and thus scales with @xmath71 . from the above equation",
    ", we see that the scaling contribution to the critical line separating the superfluid and insulating phases is @xmath76 the critical exponents are those associated with the disordered non - interacting qcp at @xmath48 , @xmath77 .",
    "since the product @xmath78 is large we have to take into account analytic contributions to the shape of the critical line .",
    "this line can be written in general as @xmath79 where @xmath74 is an analytic function , and @xmath80 refers to the sign of @xmath5 . expanding close to the qcp , analytic contributions up to the second order dominate over the scaling term when @xmath81 . to illustrate this point , in fig .",
    "[ fig : uxdel ] we show a phase diagram close to the noninteracting fixed point at @xmath82 , for repulsive ( @xmath83 ) and attractive ( @xmath84 ) interactions .",
    "this is a plot of the superfluid fraction ( color scale ) as a function of @xmath24 and @xmath22 , obtained by diagonalizing the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ham ] ) for @xmath85 interacting bosons on a lattice of @xmath86 sites .",
    "we can see that a straight line [ i.e. , @xmath87 is a very good approximation to the boundary between the superfluid and localized regions . even though the transition is smoothed out by the small lattice size",
    ", it is worth mentioning that the value of @xmath33 at the critical point @xmath88 is compatible with the lower curve of fig .",
    "[ fig : sffaa ] for @xmath86 .",
    "we studied the superfluid - insulator transition for bosons on a one - dimensional lattice , both with random disorder and the pseudo disorder described by the aubry - andr model , the two prototype models employed in the investigation of localization for ultracold atoms in optical lattices . using a finite - size - scaling analysis of the superfluid fraction , we obtained the critical exponents characterizing this transition .",
    "the superfluid fraction yields the correlation - length exponent @xmath6 and the dynamic critical exponent @xmath9 . for random disorder",
    "we found @xmath30 and @xmath34 , while for the aa model the results are @xmath58 and @xmath89 .",
    "the other critical exponents can be obtained from the quantum hyperscaling relations @xcite @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "these two models fall into different universality classes , which is not surprising since the critical disorder strength for the superfluid - insulator transition is zero for anderson - like disorder and nonzero for the aa model , which also exhibits a multifractal energy spectrum at the qcp .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the scaling form of the free energy for nonzero temperature @xmath92 can be used to determine the thermodynamic behavior close to the superfluid - insulating qcp . from it , a general dependence of the specific heat with temperature",
    "is obtained @xcite , with the form @xmath93 .",
    "our brief discussion of interaction effects in the aa model shows that the critical point moves to stronger disorder for repulsive interaction , and to weaker disorder in the attractive case .",
