    "within the hierarchical model of the universe , galaxy mergers are thought to be the main formation channel for the build up of massive elliptical galaxies .",
    "these , and fainter , galaxies are known to host a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) at their centre ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; richstone et al .  1998 ; ferrarese & ford 2005 , and references therein ) .",
    "it has therefore been hypothesized that the depleted cores in core - srsic galaxies are due to the action of coalescing black hole binaries which are produced in major , dissipationless ( gas free or `` dry '' ) mergers of galaxies ( e.g. , begelman et al .  1980 ; ebisuzaki et al .",
    "1991 ; milosavljevi & merritt 2001 ; merritt 2006 ) .",
    "indeed , observations have found binary smbhs at kpc separation ( e.g. , ngc 6240 , komossa et al .",
    "2003 ; arp 299 , ballo et al .  2004 ; 0402 + 379 , rodriguez et al .  2006 ;",
    "mrk 463 , bianchi et al .",
    "2008 ) , and slowly more are being found at closer separations ( e.g. , burke - spolaor 2011 ; ju et al .",
    "2013 ; liu et al .",
    "in such a scenario , three - body interactions involving stars and the smbh binary would decay the smbh binary orbit via the slingshot ejection of stars from the centres of the `` dry '' galaxy merger remnant , naturally creating the observed central stellar light ( mass ) deficits in giant elliptical galaxies and bulges ( e.g. , king & minkowski 1966 ; king 1978 ; binney & mamon 1982 ; lauer 1985 ; kormendy 1985 ; crane et al .  1993 ; ferrarese et al .",
    "1994 , 2006 ; lauer et al .  1995 ; byun et al .  1996",
    "; faber et al .  1997 ; carollo et al .",
    ".    numerical simulations targeting the evolution of massive black hole binaries have predicted that the central stellar mass deficit , @xmath10 , of a core - srsic galaxy , i.e. , the ejected stellar mass , scales with the mass of the smbh binary and the number of ( equivalent ) major `` dry '' mergers that the galaxy has experienced ( e.g. , milosavljevi & merritt 2001 ; merritt 2006 ) .",
    "other theoretical studies have proposed enhanced mass deficits as large as 5 @xmath15 as a result of additional stellar ejections from repetitive core passages of `` recoiled '' smbhs ( e.g. , boylan - kolchin et al .  2004 ; gualandris & merritt 2008 ) , or due to the actions of multiple smbhs from merging galaxies ( kulkarni & loeb 2012 ) .    tight scaling relations involving the structural parameters of both core - srsic and srsic galaxies have been shown to exist ( e.g. , graham 2013 and references therein ) . while these correlations can yield clues to the processes of galaxy formation and evolution ,",
    "the reliability of this approach depends on the robustness of the modelling employed for deriving the structural parameters . although the parameters of the nuker model ( grillmair et al .",
    "1994 ; kormendy et al .  1994 ; lauer et al .",
    "1995 ) are known to vary with the fitted radial extent of the light profile , due to the fact that the straight outer power - law profile of the nuker model fails to capture the curved ( srsic ) surface brightness profiles of galaxies beyond their core region ( graham et al .",
    "2003 ; dullo & graham 2012 ) , a work around has been suggested . applying the nuker model to the light profiles of 120 `` core '' galaxies , lauer et al .",
    "( 2007a ) noted that the nuker model break radii ( @xmath16 ) are only roughly correlated with the galaxy properties .",
    "however , they identified a better correlated parameter @xmath17 ( the `` cusp radius '' ) as a measure of the core size ( carollo et al .  1997a ; rest et al .",
    "dullo & graham ( 2012 ) subsequently showed that this cusp radius closely matches the break radius of the core - srsic model which we employ here ) are typically two times bigger than the core - srsic model break radii which are defined relative to the inward extrapolation of the outer srsic function . ] .",
    "fitting this model additionally enables us to determine a galaxy s global structural parameters such as its luminosity and half light radius , and to measure the central stellar deficit relative to the outer srsic profile .",
    "as noted by graham et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the issue is not only measuring the core sizes of core - srsic galaxies , but also the misclassification of coreless `` srsic '' galaxies as galaxies having partially depleted cores . using the core - srsic model ,",
    "dullo & graham ( 2012 ) found that 18@xmath18 of their sample of 39 galaxies which were previously alleged to have depleted cores according to the nuker model were actually srsic galaxies with no cores .",
    "although lauer ( 2012 ) subsequently reported that the core identification disagreement between the nuker model and the core - srsic model was only at the level of @xmath19 , dullo & graham ( 2013 , their appendix a.2 ) revisited and confirmed the 18% disagreement . in some cases ,",
    "additional nuclear components show up as an excess relative to the outer srsic profile , yet these components shallow inner profile resulted in the nuker model labelling them as `` core '' galaxies .",
    "in this paper we analyse the 26 suspected core - srsic elliptical galaxies , presenting new light profiles which cover a large radial range @xmath20 .",
    "our sample selection , data reduction , and light profile extraction technique are discussed in section  [ sec2 ] . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we outline our fitting analysis , provide our results , and additionally compare them to those from published works , paying attention to the issue of double , triple and higher srsic model fits .    in section [ sec4 ] ,",
    "we present updated structural parameters and scaling relations , including central and global properties , of core - srsic early - type galaxies . in section [ sec5.1 ]",
    "we discuss the connection between the galaxy core size and the black hole mass . in section [ sec5.2 ]",
    ", we discuss the methodology that is applied to derive the stellar mass deficits in the core - srsic early - type galaxies , and in section [ sec5.3 ] we then compare our mass deficits with past measurements .",
    "finally , section [ sec5.4 ] discusses alternative scenarios which have been presented in the literature for generating cores in luminous galaxies .",
    "our main conclusions are summarised in section [ sec6 ] .",
    "we include three appendices at the end of this paper .",
    "the first presents the core - srsic model fits for all 26 galaxies together with a review on two galaxies with complicated structures .",
    "notes on five suspected lenticular galaxies with a bulge plus disc stellar light distribution are given in the second appendix , while the third appendix provides a comparison between this work and modelling by others of common light profiles .",
    "in so doing we highlight a number of issues in the literature today that are important but currently poorly recognised .",

    "<S> new surface brightness profiles from 26 early - type galaxies with suspected partially depleted cores have been extracted from the full radial extent of _ hubble space telescope _ images . </S>",
    "<S> we have carefully quantified the radial stellar distributions of the elliptical galaxies using the core - srsic model whereas for the lenticular galaxies a core - srsic bulge plus an exponential disc model gives the best representation . </S>",
    "<S> we additionally caution about the use of excessive multiple srsic functions for decomposing galaxies and compare with past fits in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> the structural parameters obtained from our fitted models are in general , in good agreement with our initial study using radially limited ( @xmath0 ) profiles , and are used here to update several `` central '' as well as `` global '' galaxy scaling relations . </S>",
    "<S> we find near - linear relations between the break radius @xmath1 and the spheroid luminosity @xmath2 such that @xmath3 , and with the supermassive black hole mass @xmath4 such that @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this is internally consistent with the notion that major , dry mergers add the stellar and black hole mass in equal proportion , i.e. , @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we observe a linear relation @xmath7 for the core - srsic elliptical galaxies  where @xmath8 is the galaxies effective half light radii  which is collectively consistent with the approximately - linear , bright - end of the curved @xmath9 relation . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we measure accurate stellar mass deficits @xmath10 that are in general 0.5@xmath11  @xmath4 , and we identify two galaxies ( ngc 1399 , ngc 5061 ) that , due to their high @xmath12 ratio , may have experienced oscillatory core - passage by a ( gravitational radiation)-kicked black hole . </S>",
