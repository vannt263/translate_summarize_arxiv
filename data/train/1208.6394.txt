    "in this paper , we study asymptotic models for the propagation of internal waves in a two - fluid system , which consists in two layers of immiscible , homogeneous , ideal , incompressible and irrotational fluids under the only influence of gravity .",
    "we assume that there is no topography ( the bottom is flat ) and that the surface is confined by a flat rigid lid , although the case of a free surface could be handled with our method .",
    "the interface between the two layers of fluids is given as the graph of a function , @xmath0 , which expresses the deviation from its rest position @xmath1 at the spatial coordinate @xmath2 and at time @xmath3 .",
    "as we will focus on scalar models , we restrict ourselves to the case of horizontal dimension one .",
    "the governing equations of such a system , describing the evolution of the deformation of the interface , @xmath0 , as well as the velocity flow inside the two layers of fluid is recalled in figure  [ fig : sketchofdomain ] ( see section  [ sec : models ] for more details ) .",
    "the mathematical theory for this system of equation ( the so - called full euler system ) is extremely challenging ; see  @xcite in particular . which has led to extensive works concerning simplified , asymptotic models , aiming at capturing the main characteristics of the flow with much simpler equations , provided the size of given parameters .",
    "relevant dimensionless parameters that may be small in oceanographic situations include @xmath4 where @xmath5 measures the amplitude of the deformation at the interface with respect to the depth of the layers of fluids , and @xmath6 measures the shallowness of the two layers of fluid , when compared with the typical wavelength of the deformation . among other works",
    ", we would like to highlight  @xcite , where many asymptotic models are presented and rigorously justified , in a wide range of regimes . in each case , the resulting model consists in two relatively simple evolution equations coupling the shear velocity and the deformation at the interface .",
    "however , in this work , we are mainly interested in scalar models , which can be used in particular ( but not only as we shall see ) to describe the unidirectional propagation of gravity waves . the derivation and study of such models have a very rich and ancient history , starting with the work of boussinesq  @xcite and korteweg - de vries  @xcite which introduced the famous _ korteweg - de vries equation _ @xmath7 in the context of propagation of surface gravity waves , above one layer of homogeneous fluid ( which we refer as `` water - wave problem '' ) .",
    "however , let us note that the complete rigorous justification of such model is recent :  @xcite .",
    "such a justification is to be understood in the following sense : in the _ long wave regime _ @xmath8 the flow can be accurately approximated as a decomposition into two counterpropagating waves , each component satisfying a kdv equation ( or more generally , with the same order of accuracy , a _",
    "benjamin - bona - mahony equation _",
    "@xmath9 the situation is similar in the case of two layers of immiscible fluids , with a rigid lid ( as well as in the case of two layers with a free surface , except the flow is then decomposed into four propagating waves ) , and corresponding results are presented in  @xcite .    of course the coefficients ( @xmath10 , _ etc .",
    "_ ) depend on the situation , and a striking difference between the water - wave case and the case of internal waves is that in the latter case , there exists a critical ratio for the two layers of fluid ( depending on the ratio of the mass densities ) for which the nonlinearity coefficient @xmath11 vanishes . in that case ,",
    "heuristic arguments support the inclusion of the next order ( cubic ) nonlinearity , which yields the _ modified kdv equation _ ( see  @xcite and references therein ) : @xmath12 for the cubic nonlinearity to be of the same order of magnitude as the dispersive terms , this urges to consider the so - called ( refering to  @xcite for this non - standard denomination ) _ camassa - holm regime _ : @xmath13 note that this regime is interesting by itself as it allows larger amplitude waves than the long wave regime , and in particular yields models developing finite time breaking wave singularities  @xcite .",
    "thus we ask : _ can we extend to the camassa - holm regime the rigorous justification of the small amplitude ( long wave ) one ? _    as we shall see , the answer is not straightforward , as several evolution equations are in competition , with an accuracy depending on the situation , and in particular the criticality of the depth ratio , and localization in space of the initial data .",
    "in addition to the equations already presented above , we consider the _ extended kdv _ ( or _ gardner _ ) equation @xmath14 as presented in  @xcite , studied in  @xcite ( among other works ) , and tested against experiments in  @xcite .",
    "more generally , we work with the higher order model @xmath15 such a model has been presented and justified ( in the water - wave setting , and in the camassa - holm regime ) in  @xcite ; we therefore designate it as _ constantin - lannes _ equation .",
    "this equation is related , though slightly different from the _ camassa - holm _ equation obtained for example in  @xcite or higher order models ( see various such models formally derived in  @xcite , concerning the water wave or internal wave problem ) .",
    "however , each of these works is limited to the restrictive assumption that only one direction of propagation is non - zero .",
    "we propose to study in detail the justification of the decomposition of the flow ( although the unidirectional case is also treated ) as presented above , and in the case of internal waves with a rigid lid .",
    "our results are expressed in a very general setting : assuming only @xmath16 and expressing the accuracy of the different models as a function of these parameters .",
    "although this complicates the expression of our results , and renders the proofs fairly technical , such choice allows to cover general regimes , including the long - wave as well as the camassa - holm regimes , described above .",
    "we recover in particular the relevance of the kdv approximation in the long wave regime . in the camassa - holm regime , the conclusion not as definite , but depends on the criticality of the depth ratio , the localization in space of the initial data , as well as the time - scale which is considered .",
    "as motivated above , the main of this article is to construct and rigorously justify asymptotic models for the system of equations , presented in figure  [ fig : sketchofdomain ] , and which describe the behavior of two layers of immiscible , homogeneous , ideal , incompressible fluids under the sole influence of gravity .",
    "the derivation of such equations is not new ; we briefly recall it in section  [ ssec : fulleulersystem ] , and refer to  @xcite for more details .    the so - called _ full euler system _ can be written as two evolution equations using zakharov s canonical variables , namely @xmath17 the deformation of the interface from its rest position , and the trace of a velocity potential at the interface .",
    "such a formulation is built upon the so - called _ dirichlet - to - neumann _ operators , solving laplace s equation on the two domains of fluid , with suitable neumann or dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "lastly , we non - dimensionalize the system in order to put forward the relevant dimensionless parameters of the system , and in particular @xmath5 , the nonlinearity parameter , and @xmath6 , the shallowness parameter .",
    "we restrict our study to the following set of parameters : @xmath18 where @xmath19 are positive , finite .",
    "@xmath20 is the depth ratio , and @xmath21 is the mass density ratio .    as expressed above , our asymptotic models rely on the assumption that @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "more precisely , our results hold for any @xmath24 , with @xmath25 not necessarily small , but our approximate solutions are accurate if and only if both @xmath5 and @xmath6 are small .",
    "of course , the choice of our regime inevitably restricts the scope of our results , and the validity of our approximate models .",
    "in particular , even if we attach a great attention to impose as weak a constraint as possible on the nonlinearity and shallowness parameters in  , we forbid the depth ratio to approach zero or infinity .",
    "in particular , this is incompatible with the intermediate long wave regime ( ilw ) or benjamin - ono regime ( bo ) .",
    "it would be of great interest to extend our results to such regimes , since the equivalent model to our green - naghdi coupled model has been derived in  @xcite , together with the proof of energy estimates allowing to handle the full justification process as described below .",
    "let us also recall that one can find a very large family of coupled models in  @xcite , associated with a wide range of regimes , and all justified in the sense of consistency .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize that our results are especially adapted to parameters restricted in the so - called camassa - holm regime : @xmath26 with @xmath27 positive , finite .",

    "consequently , the time domain for which residual contributions appear is out of the scope of our rigorous results .    in order to understand the relevance of a specific evolution equation",
    ", one has to look whether the unidirectional contribution , which depends on the evolution equation itself , is smaller or greater than the different sources of error due to coupling .",

    "the pink triangles express the convergence rate .",
    "the initial data is fixed such that the left - going wave is initially two - third the right going wave , in order to avoid symmetry cancellations : @xmath785 .",

    "let us note also that the criticality of the depth ratio do not play a role in this analysis , and that simulations in the case of non - critical ratio gives similar outcome .",
