    "gamma - ray burst ( grb ) luminosity / energy relations are connections between measurable properties of the prompt gamma - ray emission with the luminosity or energy . in recent years , several empirical grb luminosity relations as standard candles for cosmology research at very high redshift have been proposed @xcite , @xcite .",
    "an important concern in the application of grbs to cosmology is the dependence on the cosmological model in the calibration of grb relations in many works . for the difficulty to calibrate the relations with a low - redshift sample , grb relations",
    "have usually been calibrated by assuming a particular cosmological model .",
    "therefore the circularity problem can not be avoided easily .",
    "many previous works treated the circularity problem by means of statistical approaches .",
    "however , we note that the circularity problem is not circumvented completely by means of statistical approaches , because a particular cosmology model is required in doing the joint fitting .    in this report",
    ", we present two new methods ( interpolation method and iterative method ) to calibrate the grb relations in a cosmological model - independent way .",
    "this report is an update and extension of our paper accepted for publication in apj@xcite .",
    "it is obvious that objects at the same redshift should have the same luminosity distance in any cosmology .",
    "there are so many sne ia that we can obtain the luminosity distance ( also the distance moduli ) at any redshift in the redshift range of sne ia by interpolating from sn ia data .",
    "recently , on the basis of smoothing the noise of supernova data over redshift , the authors in @xcite,@xcite suggested a non - parametric method in a model independent manner to reconstruct the luminosity distance at any redshift in the redshift range of sne ia by the iterative method .",
    "furthermore , the luminosity distance of sne ia obtained directly from observations are completely cosmological model independent .",
    "therefore , we can obtain the distance moduli of grbs in the redshift range of sne ia and calibrate grb relations in a completely cosmological model independent way and use the standard hubble diagram method to constrain the cosmological parameters from grb data at high redshift obtained by utilizing the relations .",
    "we first calibrate five grb luminosity / energy relations with the sample at @xmath1 , i.e. , the luminosity ( @xmath2)-spectral lag ( @xmath3 ) relation @xcite , the @xmath2-variability ( @xmath4 ) relation @xcite , the @xmath2-@xmath5 relation @xcite , the collimation - corrected energy ( @xmath6)-@xmath5 relation @xcite , the @xmath7-@xmath2 relation @xcite , where @xmath7 is the minimum rise time in the grb light curve .",
    "a grb luminosity relation can be generally written in the form of @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the intercept and slope of the relation respectively ; @xmath11 is the luminosity ( @xmath2 in units of @xmath12 ) or the collimation - corrected energy ( @xmath6 in units of @xmath13 ) ; @xmath14 is the grb parameters measured in the rest frame , e.g. , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "( we adopt the data of these quantities from ref .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "we adopt the data of 192 sne ia @xcite and show them in figure 1 .",
    "there is only one sn ia point ( the redshift of sn1997ff is @xmath19 ) at @xmath20 , therefore we exclude it from our sn ia sample used to interpolate the distance moduli of grbs in the redshift range of sn ia sample .         the hubble diagram of 192 sne ia ( red dots ) and the 69 grbs obtained by using the cosmology - independent methods .",
    "the 27 grbs at @xmath1 are obtained by using the interpolation and iterative methods directly from sn ia data ; and the 42 grbs at @xmath20 are obtained by utilizing the five relations calibrated with the sample at @xmath1 using by the cosmology - independent methods ( black circles : the interpolation method ; blue stars : the iterative method ) . the curve is the theoretical distance modulus in the concordance model ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) , and the vertical dotted line represents @xmath24 .    following a well known procedure in the analysis of large scale structure , shafieloo et al @xcite used a gaussian smoothing function rather than the top hat smoothing function to smooth the noise of the sne ia data directly . in order to obtain important information on interesting cosmological parameters expediently , when doing the gaussian smoothing@xcite @xmath25 , rather than the luminosity distance @xmath26 or distance modulus @xmath27 , is studied by the iterative method .",
    "we thus follow the iterative procedure and adopt the results from ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath28,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with a normalization parameter @xmath29 $ ] , and @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 represents the smoothed luminosity distance at any redshift @xmath32 after the @xmath33th iteration and @xmath34 denotes a guess background model .",
    "it has been shown that the results are not sensitive to the chosen vaule of @xmath35 and the assumed initial guess model .",
    "@xmath36 is the observed one from the sn ia data .",
    "the best fitting result is obtained by minimizing @xmath37 .",
    "the isotropic luminosity of a burst is calculated by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the luminosity distance of the burst and @xmath40 is the bolometric flux of gamma - rays in the burst . the isotropic energy released from a burst",
    "is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the bolometric fluence of gamma - rays in the burst at redshift @xmath32 .",
    "the total collimation - corrected energy is then calculated by @xmath43 where the beaming factor , @xmath44 is @xmath45 with the jet opening angle ( @xmath46 ) , which is related to the break time ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "we determine the values of the intercept ( @xmath9 ) and the slope ( @xmath10 ) calibrated with the grb sample at @xmath1 by using the interpolation@xcite and iterative@xcite methods , respectively .",
    "we first use the same regression method as used in ref.@xcite : the bisector of the two ordinary least - squares(ols ) linear regressions , which has been discussed in ref.@xcite , ols(y|x ) ( ols regression of the dependent variable y against the independent variable x ) and its inverse ols(x|y ) . in order to avoid specifying `` dependent '' and `` independent '' variables ,",
    "the ols(y|x ) and the ols(x|y ) lines should be bisected .",
    "the ols regressions does not take the errors into account ; but the use of weighted least - squares(wls ) , taking into account the measurable uncertainties , results in almost identical best fits .",
    "therefore , the wls bisector regression can be obtained by bisecting the wls(y|x ) and the wls(x|y ) lines .",
    "the calibration results from two regression methods ( the ols bisector and the wls bisector ) are summarized in table 1 and we also list the results calibrated with the same sample ( @xmath1 ) by assuming the @xmath48cdm model for comparison . from table 1 , we find that results from the two regression methods make no significant difference from each other . therefore , taking into account the measurement uncertainties in the regression , indeed will not change the fitting parameters significantly , when the measurement uncertainties are smaller than the intrinsic error @xcite .",
    "we also find that results obtained by assuming the @xmath48cdm with the same sample differ only slightly from , but still fully consistent with those calibrated by using our interpolation method .",
    "the reason for this is easy to understand , since the @xmath48cdm is fully compatible with sn ia data .",
    "nevertheless , it should be noticed that the calibration results obtained by using the interpolation or iterative method directly from sn ia data are completely cosmology independent .",
    ".calibration results ( @xmath9 : intercept , @xmath10 : slope ) with their 1-@xmath0 uncertainties for the five grb luminosity / energy relations with the sample at @xmath1 , by using the interpolation and iterative methods directly from sne ia data , and by assuming a particular cosmological models ( the @xmath48cdm model ) .",
    "only the data available from table 4 in ref.@xcite are used to calibrate the five grb relations . for each relation ,",
    "the results on the first and second lines are calibrated from the ols and wls bisector regressions , respectively . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "since the distance modulus of any sn ia is completely cosmological model independent , we can obtain the distance modulus of a grb at a given redshift by interpolating or iterating from the hubble diagram of sne ia at @xmath1 , in order to calibrate the grb luminosity relations in a completely cosmology independent way . since our method",
    "does not depend on a particular cosmological model when we calibrate the parameters of grb luminosity relations , the so - called circularity problem can be completely avoided . with this method",
    ", we obtained the cosmology - independent distance moduli of 42 grbs between redshift of 1.44 and 6.60 , which are listed in table 2 .    with these cosmology - independent distance moduli of high redshift grbs",
    ", we construct the grb hubble diagram and constrain cosmological parameters by the minimum @xmath49 method as in sn ia cosmology .",
    "we obtain @xmath50 , @xmath51 for the flat @xmath48cdm model from the grb data obtained by using the interpolation method , and @xmath52 , @xmath53 from the data obtained by using the iterative method . for the dark energy model with a constant equation of state ,",
    "we obtain @xmath54 and @xmath55 for a flat universe from the data obtained by the two methods respectively , which is consistent with the concordance model within the statistical error .",
    "our result suggests the the concordance model ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) is still consistent with the grb data at higher redshift up to @xmath59 .",
