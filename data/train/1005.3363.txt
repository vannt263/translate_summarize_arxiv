    "ferromagnet - superconductor hybrid structures exhibit novel phenomena which have been studied extensively in the recent years@xcite these systems provide the possibility for a controlled study of coexistence and competition of the ferromagnetism and the superconductivity .",
    "one of the most interesting effects is the possibility of forming the @xmath0 josephson junction in superconductor / ferromagnetic - metal / superconductor ( s - fm - s ) heterostructures.@xcite in a @xmath0 junction the ground - state phase difference between two coupled superconductors is @xmath0 instead of 0 as in the ordinary 0 junctions .",
    "the existence of the @xmath0 junction in s - fm - s systems has been confirmed in experiment by ryanzanov et al.@xcite and by kontos et al.@xcite in terms of the josephson relationship @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the phase difference between the two superconductor layers , a transition from the 0 to @xmath0 states implies a change in sign of @xmath7 from positive to negative .",
    "physically , such a change in sign of @xmath7 is a consequence of a phase change in the pairing wave - function induced in the fm layer due to the proximity effect .",
    "recently , @xmath8 qubits consisting of a superconducting loop with a s - fm - s @xmath0 junction have been theoretically proposed.@xcite in the quiet qubits , a quantum two level system ( qubits ) is spontaneously generated and therefore it is expected to be robust to the decoherence by the fluctuation of the external magnetic field . from the viewpoint of the quantum dissipation , however , the structure of s - fm - s junctions is inherently identical with s - n - s junctions ( n is a normal nonmagnetic metal ) .",
    "therefore a gapless quasiparticle excitation in the fm layer is inevitable .",
    "this feature gives a strong ohmic dissipation@xcite and the coherence time of s - fm - s quiet qubits is bound to be very short .",
    "on the other hand , as was predicted by tanaka and kashiwaya,@xcite the @xmath0 junction can be formed in josephson junctions with ferromagnetic insulators ( fis ) . by using the functional integral method,@xcite",
    "we have theoretically proposed a superconductor phase@xcite and flux type qubits@xcite based on s - fi - s @xmath0 junctions .",
    "moreover we have showed that the effect of the dissipation due to the quasi - particle excitations on macroscopic quantum tunneling is negligibly small.@xcite however , in above studies , we have used a very simple @xmath9-function model as the fi barrier .",
    "therefore , the correspondence between this toy mode and the actual band structure of fis is unclear . in this paper",
    ", we will formulate a numerical calculation method for the josephson current through fis by taking into account the band structure of fis .",
    "then we will discuss the possibility of the formation of the @xmath0-coupling for the josephson junction the two types of the fi , i.e. , the fully polarized fi ( fpfi ) and the eu chalcogenides ( e.g. , euo and eus).@xcite",
    "the typical density of states of fpfi for each spin direction is shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) . one of the representative material of fpfi is undoped la@xmath1bacuo@xmath2.@xcite the exchange splitting @xmath10 is estimated to be 0.34 ev by the first - principle band calculation using the spin - polarized local density approximation.@xcite since the exchange splitting is larger and the bands were originally half - filled , the system becomes an fi .",
    "on the other hand , recently spin filtering effect are intensively studied by use of the eu chalcogenides.@xcite the schematic energy - band structure of the eu chalcogenides is shown in fig .",
    "the eu chalcogenides stand out among the fis as ideal heisenberg ferromagnets , with a high magnetic moment and a large exchange splitting of the conduction band for eu @xmath11-electrons . utilizing the exchange splitting ( @xmath12 ) to filter spins ,",
    "these materials produce a near - fully spin - polarized current when used as a tunnel barrier . of the eu chalcogenides , euo has the largest @xmath12 and the highest curie temperature ( @xmath13 k for bulk ) .    in euo ,",
    "the large saturation magnetic moment @xmath14 per eu@xmath15 originates from the seven unpaired electrons localized at the @xmath16 band below the fermi energy .",
    "ferromagnetic order of the @xmath16 spins causes exchange splitting of the conduction 5@xmath3 band , lowering ( raising ) the spin - up ( -down ) band symmetrically by @xmath17 . a large exchange splitting of 0.54 ev was determined by measuring the redshift of the absorption edge in single crystals of euo cooled below @xmath18.@xcite        when an ultrathin film of the eu chalcogenides is used as the tunnel barrier between two metallic electrodes , the exchange splitting of the conduction band gives rise to a lower barrier height for spin - up electrons and a higher barrier height for spin - down electrons . because of the tunnel current depends exponentially on the barrier height,@xcite the tunneling probability for spin - up electrons is much greater than for spin - down electrons , leading to a highly spin - polarized current .",
    "this phenomenon is called the spin - filter effect .",
    "in this section , we develop a numerical calculation method for the josephson current of s - fi - s junctions .",
    "let us consider the two - dimensional tight - binding model for a s - fi - s junction as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the vector @xmath19 points to a lattice site , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are unit vectors in the @xmath22 and @xmath23 directions , respectively . in the @xmath23 direction , we apply the periodic boundary condition for the number of lattice sites being @xmath24 .",
