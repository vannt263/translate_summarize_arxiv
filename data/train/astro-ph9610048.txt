    "the sunyaev  zeldovich ( sz ) effect describes the distortion introduced to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) spectrum due to its compton scattering off free electrons , which are either hot ( the _ thermal _ effect ) or possess a bulk peculiar velocity ( the _ kinematic _ effect ; see reviews of both effects in sunyaev & zeldovich 1980 and rephaeli 1995 ) .",
    "the thermal sz effect provides an important diagnostic of the hot gas in clusters of galaxies , and by now has been measured in a number of systems ( see table 1 in rephaeli 1995 ) .",
    "the kinematic effect has an amplitude which is typically an order - of magnitude smaller and has not yet been definitively detected ( see rephaeli & lahav 1991 and haehnelt & tegmark 1995 , regarding prospects for a future detection ) .",
    "it has long been realized that a measurement of the thermal sz effect , combined with x  ray observations , can be used to estimate the distance to the cluster and hence the hubble constant , @xmath2 , under the assumption that the cluster is spherical ( cavaliere , danese , & de zotti 1977 , gunn 1978 , silk & white 1978 , birkinshaw 1979 ) . the inferred value of the hubble constant is inversely proportional to the square of the sz temperature decrement .",
    "this approach had led to values of the hubble constant which are typically on the low side of the range inferred from other methods ( see , e.g. , table 2 in rephaeli 1995 ) .",
    "an often cited systematic effect that could account for this bias is elongation of the selected clusters along the line - of - sight . in this _ letter _ , we explore a different effect which leads to a systematic bias towards low@xmath2 values even if these clusters are perfectly spherical .",
    "the effect results from gravitational lensing by the cluster potentials .",
    "measurements of the decrement in the rayleigh  jeans ( rj ) temperature of the microwave background due to the thermal sz effect are routinely accompanied by the removal of background radio sources down to some flux threshold ( see , e.g. , birkinshaw , hughes , & arnaud 1991 ) . in this process , it is implicitly assumed that the flux threshold for the removal of sources behind the cluster core is the same as in a control field far from the cluster center .",
    "however , this assumption is not strictly true due to the inevitable magnification bias which is introduced by the gravitational lensing effect of the cluster potential . in reality",
    ", the cluster acts as a lens which magnifies and thus resolves sources that are otherwise below the detection threshold .",
    "the residual intensity of unresolved sources is therefore systematically lower behind the cluster core , as compared to that in the control field .",
    "lensing artificially increases the flux deficit behind the cluster core and thus leads to a systematic underestimate of the hubble constant .    in this _",
    "we calculate the effect of lensing on sz measurements of the hubble constant .",
    "our discussion on lensing follows closely the approach developed in an earlier paper ( refregier & loeb 1996 , hereafter rl ) which focused on lensing of the x  ray background by galaxy clusters ; the interested reader should consult this earlier paper for more details . here",
    ", we describe our models for the background population of radio sources and for the cluster potential in  [ model ] .",
    "we then show in ",
    "[ lensing_effect ] how the lensing effect leads to a systematic decrement in the intensity of unresolved sources . in  [ results ] , we present numerical results for different values of our model parameters and for the specific example of a2218 .",
    "finally ,  [ conclusion ] summarizes the main conclusions of this work .",
    "we model the gravitational potential of the cluster as a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) ( e.g. schneider et al .",
    "this model provides a good first ",
    "order approximation to the projected mass distribution of known cluster lenses ( tyson & fischer 1995 , narayan & bartelmann 1996 , squires et al .",
    "1996a , b ) .",
    "the sis potential causes background sources to appear brighter but diluted on the sky by the magnification factor @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the angle between the image of the source and the lens center , and @xmath5 is the einstein angle . for a sis with a line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath6 , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the lens  source and the observer  source angular diameter distances , respectively .    in general , the einstein angle @xmath5 depends on the redshifts of the lens , @xmath10 , and of the source , @xmath11 .",
    "however , the dependence on the source redshift is weak if @xmath12 ( cf . fig . 1 in rl ) .",
    "most measurements of the sz effect are performed with nearby clusters ( @xmath13 ) , while sub  mjy radio sources have median redshifts in the range @xmath14 ( windhorst et al .",
    "we therefore take @xmath5 to be independent of @xmath11 and simply consider the two  dimensional distribution of radio sources on the sky .",
    "we model the flux distribution of background radio sources according to the observed number  flux relation at 4.86 ghz ( windhorst et al .",
    "the squares in figure  [ fig : n_s_norm ] show the mean values of the observed differential counts , @xmath15 , normalized by @xmath16 .",
    "the dotted line illustrates the number counts limits inferred by fomalont et al .",
    "( 1991 ) from a fluctuation analysis of the radio source background ( see also windhorst et al .",
    "the observed counts extend from @xmath17 to 10 jy .",
    "we model these counts by six broken power laws of the form , @xmath18 for @xmath19 , with @xmath20 .",
    "the six slope parameters are @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "the power - law break points are @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 jy . the normalization is set by imposing continuity and using @xmath32 jy@xmath33 sr@xmath34 .",
    "the model relation is shown as the solid line in figure  [ fig : n_s_norm ] .",

    "( 1993 ) . for a typical sz threshold @xmath36jy ,",
    "the results are not sensitive to the parameters of this extrapolation .",
    "our total 4.86 ghz intensity from radio sources is @xmath37 jy sr@xmath34 or equivalently 5.1 mk .    at frequencies above 4.86 ghz , we approximate the mean spectrum of the sources by a power law , @xmath38 . based on the observed fluxes between 1.418.44 ghz , windhorst et al .",
    "( 1993 ) estimate the median spectral index of sources with @xmath39 mjy to be @xmath40 .",
    "radio sources with @xmath41 mjy have a median angular size @xmath42 ( cf .",
    "2 in windhorst et al . 1993 ) . in the first radio survey , white et al . ( 1997 ) found that only @xmath43 of all sources with @xmath44 mjy have a major axis @xmath45 .",
    "the angular extent of sub  mjy radio sources is thus much smaller than the einstein angle of clusters with observed arcs ( @xmath46 ; see le fvre et al .",
    "1994 ) , as well as the beam size used in sz measurements ( @xmath47 ; cf .",
    "rephaeli 1995 ) .",
    "thus , we can safely ignore the finite extent of the radio sources and treat them as if they were pointlike .",
    "in a region of the sky where the magnification factor is @xmath35 , the apparent differential count of sources obtains the value @xmath48 , where hat denotes unlensed quantities .",
    "in particular , for a power law differential count relation , @xmath49 , the observed differential count is , @xmath50 . the differential count therefore increases ( decreases ) as @xmath35 increases if @xmath51 is above ( below ) the critical slope @xmath52 . when @xmath53 , lensing has no effect on the apparent differential count .",
    "interestingly , figure  [ fig : n_s_norm ] shows that the actual radio count slope oscillates around @xmath54 for fluxes @xmath55jy .    in measurements of the sz effect ,",
    "discrete sources are typically removed down to a given detection flux threshold , @xmath56 .",
    "the mean residual intensity @xmath57 due to the superposition of all undetected discrete sources with fluxes below @xmath56 is then assumed to be equal to its sky  averaged value @xmath58 however , the magnification due to lensing lowers the unresolved intensity _ systematically _ relative to its sky  averaged value and changes it to , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is given by equation  ( [ eq : mu_theta ] ) .",
    "lensing conserves the total intensity of the radio source background and merely reduces the effective flux threshold for resolving sources by a factor @xmath35 .",
    "the intensity offset due to lensing is then , @xmath61 . in the rj regime , this can be expressed more conveniently in terms of the brightness temperature difference , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is boltzmann s constant . for @xmath64 ( i.e. , @xmath65 ) ,",
    "the unresolved intensity is decreased , implying a negative @xmath66 , and so the sz decrement in the rj regime , @xmath67 , is overestimated due to lensing .",
    "note that for @xmath68 , equation  ( [ eq : mu_theta ] ) yields @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "[ large_theta ]    the effect of lensing on estimates of @xmath71 can be easily found from the scaling , @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the temperature offset produced by the sz effect .",
    "the small systematic correction @xmath74 , which must be incorporated in order to compensate for the lensing effect is , to leading order , @xmath75 for @xmath76 and the rj spectral regime , both @xmath77 and @xmath78 are negative and so @xmath79 is positive .",
    "the lensing correction will then tend to increase the estimated value of the hubble constant .",

    "the dependence of @xmath81 on the einstein angle @xmath5 and on frequency @xmath82 were conveniently factored out .",
    "the einstein angles for clusters with observed optical arcs are in the range of @xmath83@xmath84 ( le fvre et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the lensing decrement , @xmath66 , shows a sharp peak near the einstein angle . for @xmath85 , @xmath66",
    "is first weakened and then enhanced as @xmath56 varies from @xmath86 to @xmath87 jy .",
    "this is due to the fact that the count slope @xmath51 crosses the critical value @xmath88 around @xmath89 jy ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : n_s_norm ] ) .",
    "the enhancement in @xmath66 as @xmath56 decreases below @xmath90 jy occurs in spite of the decrease in the unlensed intensity @xmath91 there . at these fluxes ,",
    "the removal of fainter radio sources paradoxically makes the lensing decrement more pronounced .",
    "note that because of the large shot noise in the source counts ( with an rms of @xmath92 in a 1 arcmin@xmath93 cell for @xmath94 jy ) , @xmath77 will _ not _ necessarily be realized in each individual cluster .",
    "the lensing induced decrement should be regarded as a systematic effect that must be corrected for statistically , when a large sample of clusters is considered . for observations with a large field of view",
    ", the lensing signature might appear in the outer part of each individual cluster .    as a specific example we consider a2218 , an abell richness class 4 cluster at a redshift @xmath95 , which shows several optical arcs ( pell et al .",
