    "color transparency ( ct ) can be defined as the absence of or reduced final state interaction of a nucleon with the nucleus in semiexclusive high momentum transfer processes .",
    "examples are the ( e , ep ) and ( p , pp ) reactions occuring on nuclear targets , in which the detected protons have enough energy to ensure that no pions are produced . for color transparency to be observed",
    "three conditions have to be met @xcite .",
    "\\(i ) a small wave packet is formed in a high momentum transfer reaction .",
    "this wave packet is sometimes dubbed a point like configurations(plc ) .",
    "\\(ii ) a small wave packet interacts weakly with the nucleus .",
    "\\(iii ) the wave packet escapes the nucleus before expanding .",
    "these conditions are true in the perturbative regime @xcite , but have to be tested in the nonperturbative regime .",
    "lattice qcd is a natural tool to use in this investigation .",
    "it can be used to investigate the form of the hadron - hadron interaction @xcite , to probe the wave packet ( hopefully plc ) produced in a high momentum transfer reaction , and to examine the expansion of the plc .",
    "the separation of the interaction into the hard high momentum transfer part and the soft final state interaction part is crucial for ct . to be specific consider ( e , ep ) reaction . in this case",
    "the hard process is the absorption of the virtual photon by a nucleon in the nucleus .",
    "an additional hard interaction is expected to be suppressed by the experimental kinematics , and the final state interaction of the plc with the nucleus is of a soft low - momentum - transfer nature .",
    "there are two amplitudes to be compared .",
    "the first one is for the proton to escape the nucleus without interaction .",
    "the second one is for the proton to be detected after the plc is scattered by the soft interaction with the nuclear medium .",
    "ct can be obtained if the ratio of the second amplitude to the first one vanishes in the limit of @xmath4 .",
    "ideally one would like to reconstruct on the lattice the process described above : to create a wave packet by acting with the electromagnetic current operator on the proton , and to evaluate the amplitude of this wave packet to be transformed into a proton by some realistic nucleon - plc interaction . in this paper",
    "we will not take on this challenging and complex problem .",
    "we concentrate on one aspect of the question - the expansion of a model small size wave packet . to further simplify our task we consider two - quark pion instead of three - quark proton .",
    "we start by defining the necessary lattice constructions in sec.2 . a point source , one of the conventionally used interpolating fields ,",
    "is used to generate the small size wave packet - plc .",
    "a pion is detected in the final state after the plc experiences the soft interaction .",
    "a model form of the soft interaction @xmath5 @xcite is used , with @xmath6 representing the transverse separation of the quarks .",
    "the wave packet undergoes euclidean time evolution .",
    "the quantity @xmath2 , which measures the strength of the soft interaction of the evolving plc with the nuclear medium , is calculated as a function of the euclidean time @xmath7 .",
    "the analytical continuation to the minkowsky time @xmath8 is then performed . in sec.3",
    "the lattice details are given .",
    "the purpose of using lattice qcd is to obtain matrix elements from the first principle calculations .",
    "unfortunately it entails the euclidean time evolution .",
    "our procedure is to treat the wave packet as a coherent sum of physical states , so the real problem is how to detect as many states as possible before they decay away .",
    "these states are extracted by a many pole fit of the lattice results .",
    "this procedure is complicated and controversial .",
    "we discuss it for the two - point correlation function in sec.4 . to perform the analytical continuation",
    "the @xmath2 is fit with the sum of three exponentials .",
    "the details of the @xmath2 three pole fit are given in sec.5 .",
    "the results of the analytical continuation and their discussion are presented in sec.6 .",
    "the relative merits of using a full or a diagonal covariance matrix to fit observables is discussed in the appendix .",
    "we want to consider the expansion of a small size wave packet .",
    "to form such a wave packet we take advantage of the point interpolating field @xmath9 , which has the following form in the pseudoscalar channel @xmath10 by acting on the vacuum @xmath9 creates an object similar to a plc , since the quark and the antiquark are created at the same site .",
    "this wave packet can be expanded in a complete set of zero momentum states @xmath11 : @xmath12 where the summation over @xmath13 projects out the zero momentum states .",
    "the coefficient @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the strength with which the state @xmath11 is excited from the vacuum , @xmath16 is a normalization factor .",
    "we have to note that even though the interpolating field creates a quark and an antiquark at the same site , there is a non - zero probability to detect them separated by some distance at the same time they are created .",
    "this occurs because fermion propagators do not vanish outside of the light cone .",
    "if we transport the @xmath17 with the euclidean transfer matrix @xmath18 and then contract it with itself we obtain the two - point correlation function @xmath19 :    @xmath20    @xmath19 plays a complementary role in our investigation , as will be seen below .    our main objective is to evaluate the strength of the soft interaction of the expanding plc with the nucleus .",
    "this interaction can be described ( @xcite and references therein ) by the operator @xmath5 with @xmath6 representing the transverse separation of the quarks in the plc : direction to be longitudinal . ]",
    "@xmath21 here we normalize it by @xmath22 , which represents the amplitude of the detecting the pion without the soft interaction . to find the matrix element (  [ eq : soft ] ) we need to know the wave functions of the plc and the pion .",
    "there is no unique way to define the wave functions on the lattice .",
    "we use the gauge invariant formulation of equal time bethe - salpeter amplitude @xmath23 @xcite @xmath24    the bethe - salpeter amplitude in the gauge invariant formulation is known @xcite to underestimate the spatial extent of the pion wave function .",
    "but it does not suffer from finite lattice size errors and is hoped to give a qualitatively correct estimate of the effects under consideration .    in a fashion similar to @xmath19 @xmath25",
    "can be expanded in a complete set of states @xmath26 where latexmath:[\\[\\psi_\\nu({\\bf r})=<0|\\overline{d}(0,0 ) \\gamma_5",

    "if we knew the @xmath33 s , @xmath14 s , and @xmath34 s for all the contributing states , then a mere substitution @xmath35 would give us @xmath36 , which describes the expansion of the plc in the real time .",
    "this is certainly too much to ask for .",
    "since we work with the euclidean time most of the states decay away too quickly to be detected .",
    "we assume that the spectral density can be represented as a sum of several sharp poles . with this assumption",
    "the goal is to try to determine the @xmath33 s , @xmath14 s , and @xmath34 s for as many states as possible .",
    "we perform the many pole fit of @xmath2 with the fit function @xmath37 : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the number of the poles .",

    "first , there has been some concern expressed in the literature @xcite about the validity of such a many pole fit .",

    "the calculations are performed for @xmath40 gauge theory with the coupling constant @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath40 is chosen to increase the efficiency of the calculation and improve statistics .",
    "the size of the lattice is @xmath42 .",
    "60 quenched gauge field configurations are generated using metropolis method with overrelaxation @xcite . the first configuration is selected after 2000 thermalization sweeps and all the consecutive ones after 1000 sweeps .",
    "the wilson propagators are calculated for three values of the hopping parameter @xmath43 .",
    "periodic boundary condition in the spatial directions and dirichlet boundary conditions in the time direction are used .",
    "a standard procedure @xcite is used to construct the two - point correlation function and the bathe - salpeter amplitude out of the quark propagators .",

    "the covariance matrix fit is performed to determine the parameters needed .",
    "a detailed description of this procedure is given in sec .",
    "all statistical errors are estimated by the single elimination jacknife @xcite .",
    "the point source is placed at the time slice @xmath53 and the fitting is performed over the range @xmath54 through @xmath55 .",
    "a many pole fit involves many problems , some of which are mentioned in @xcite . to address these problems",
    "we perform a detailed analysis of the fit of the two - point correlation function @xmath19 .",
    "the fit function @xmath56 @xmath57 corresponds to @xmath39-pole fit .",
    "we would like to emphasize that our goal here is to extract as many states as possible to be able to form a small size wave packet .",
    "this is contrary to the intention of the majority of the papers in the field , where the isolation of one state , usually the ground state , is pursued .    a standard approach in determining parameters",
    "@xmath58 s and @xmath59 s is to minimize the goodness - of - fit statistic @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath61 the jacknife method is used to calculate the covariance matrix @xmath62 @xmath63}(t)-g_2(t ) ) ( g_2^{[k]}(t')-g_2(t'),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the number of configurations , @xmath65}(t)$ ] are found for a subset of @xmath66 configurations with @xmath67 configurations omitted .",
    "simulated annealing is our choice of the minimization technique .",
    "the full covariance matrix is used in the minimization(correlated @xmath60 fit ) .",
    "there have been studies @xcite to show that for a small data sample use of the full covariance matrix is unreliable . in @xcite a use of several well defined eigenmodes of the covariant matrix is proposed . the use of a full covariant matrix versus the diagonal part thereof poses an interesting problem .",
    "we address this problem in the appendix , where we consider a simple example amenable to the analytical treatment .",
    "the conclusion is reached that a correlated fit gives better results if the correlations are appreciable .",
    "this is generally the case for lattice calculations , and it is true for our calculations .",
    "moreover , we consider 60 configurations to be sufficient for the maximum of 9 degrees of freedom we have while fitting @xmath19 .",
    "the fitting is performed over a time range extending from @xmath68 to @xmath69 .",
    "we choose @xmath70 to exclude the boundary effects and @xmath68 is varied from 6 to 14 .",
    "the number of states used in a fit is determined by the @xmath68 .",
    "one of the problems with a many pole fit @xcite is that the result depends on the @xmath68 used for the fit , and it is not _ a priori _ clear how many states should be included in a fit .",
    "the strategy developed to tackle this problem is as follows .",
    "we start with @xmath68 for which only the ground state contribution is significant , and one - pole fit is performed . as @xmath68 decreases more states with higher masses come into play .",
    "to decide between two fits with different number of poles for a particular @xmath68 the preference is given to a fit with smaller value of @xmath60 per degree of freedom .",
    "the results for the @xmath59 s for the hopping parameter @xmath71 are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "for @xmath72 one state is enough , for @xmath73 two states had to be included , and for @xmath74 the @xmath19 is best fit with three states .",
    "the results for the other two hopping parameters are similar .",
    "the values of the @xmath60 per degree of freedom show that the fit for the longest time range is the best ( table 1 ) .",
    "the pattern in the results for @xmath59 is obvious .",
    "the statistical error is the greatest when a new state is included in the fit , it then decreases and jumps back , when another state is included . to explain this pattern the following plot is made .",
    "the individual contributions @xmath75 of the states to the two - point correlation function @xmath19 are shown in fig .",
    "they are compared with the statistical error on the @xmath19 .",
    "two time slices @xmath76 and @xmath77 are important , since at those times the second and third states , go above the statistical noise . those are precisely the time slices for which the contribution of these states is included in the fit .",
    "a simple rule follows : a state should be included if its contribution is greater than the statistical error ; it should not be included if its contribution is less than the statistical error .",
    "the best results of the fitting are obtained for the longest time span of the highest energy state used in the fitting .",
    "an interesting consequence is that , in general , the longest time range is not necessarily the best for determining the parameters . consider the following example .",
    "suppose that in fig .",
    "1 the results of the three pole fit started at @xmath78 ( i.e. the source was at @xmath79 and the results for @xmath80 and @xmath81 were not present ) .",
    "in that case a reliable determination of the third state s parameters would be impossible ; furthermore we would be forced to use the shorter time range with @xmath77 to determine the parameters of the two lowest states .",
    "another interesting observation concerns the fact that @xmath60 has many minima in the multi - dimensional space of @xmath58 s and @xmath59 s .",
    "the  real \" minimum is not always the global one . by the `` real '' we mean the one we believe to be the best fit . in our case",
    "the best fit is obtained for the @xmath80 .",
    "we ran the minimization for @xmath82 and @xmath78 and found local minima very close to the `` real '' one .",
    "the gain in @xmath60 compared to the global minimum is only @xmath83 per degree of freedom .    to support this argument",
    "the following simulation is performed .",
    "we work our way backwards .",
    "four sets of @xmath84 and @xmath85 are chosen .",
    "a `` correlation function '' @xmath86 is calculated : @xmath87 then statistical noise is added and 60 `` configurations '' are generated .",
    "the subsequent fitting procedure yield results that have all the basic features of the fitting of the lattice data(fig .  3 ) .",
    "the input values of the parameters of three states are recovered ( within the error bars ) .",
    "the fourth state is intentionally chosen to decay below the statistical noise by @xmath54 . in this simulation",
    "we know what the correct values of the parameters are , and we can verify that for @xmath82 and @xmath78 there are local minima very close to these correct values .    we conclude that for the given choice of interpolating field and lattice spacing three pole fit of the two - point correlation function can be performed and the values of the excitation strength @xmath58 and the mass @xmath59 reliably determined .",
    "these values are presented in table 2 .",
    "the determination of the @xmath58 s and @xmath59 s is interesting , but it is does not constitute the main objective of this paper . what does is the strength of the soft interaction @xmath2 , which we fit with the eq .",
    "(  [ eq : f ] ) . as was indicated in the introduction , a fit of @xmath2 alone",
    "does not give a satisfactory result .",
    "to understand it , note that a coefficient @xmath88 in eq .",
    "(  [ eq : f ] ) is proportional to the excitation strength @xmath58 and the soft interaction transition matrix element @xmath89 of the state @xmath90 .",
    "for the three states , that we are able to extract from the two - point correlation function @xmath19 , the excitation strength @xmath58 grows with @xmath91 .",
    "( physically it means that their wave functions have a better overlap with the wave function of the initially formed wave packet . ) unlike the coefficients @xmath58 @xmath89 turned out to decrease rapidly with @xmath91 . as a consequence the contribution to the @xmath2 of the exited states disappears below the statistical noise much sooner than for the @xmath19 .",
    "this forces us to fit @xmath2 together with @xmath19 .",
    "we would like to note here that the procedure we use to compute @xmath2 is akin to the smearing technique used in @xcite to isolate the contribution of meson and baryon ground states . however , let us stress it again , this is not our intention .",
    "this is an `` accident '' , but an `` accident '' with some physical consequences , which are discussed below .",
    "the simultaneous fit of @xmath2 and @xmath19 is performed for the longest time range possible ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "the results are shown in the table 3 .",
    "@xmath89 goes down by a factor of 2 with every excited state .",
    "another important feature is that @xmath92 is negative .",
    "this allows for the formation of a reduced size wave packet .",
    "let s discuss the physical meaning of these results .",
    "do they have any relevance for color transparency ?",
    "again consider ( e , ep ) process . in this case",
    "the coefficients @xmath14 defining the plc are the elastic and inelastic form factors of the ground state . in general",
    "we can expect these coefficients to exibit a resonant behavior - to have a peak for a certain excited state .",
    "but the soft interaction supresses the contribution of the higher excited states , as @xmath34 decreases rapidly with @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "this suppression plays a crucial role in achieving a slow expansion rate of the plc .",
    "our result turned out to have these basic features .",
    "the @xmath58 grows with @xmath91 , whereas @xmath94 decreases rapidly .",
    "the former is only a result of our choice of the model wave packet and in this sense is arbitrary .",
    "the latter , however , reflects the properties of hadronic states in lattice qcd , and to the extent that we believe lattice qcd , this is an indication of the possibility of the suppression of the contribution of the higher excited states by the soft interaction .",
    "having obtained the parameters @xmath95 for the three lowest states , we substitute @xmath35 in eq .",
    "(  [ eq : b^2spectr ] ) and plot the real part of @xmath36 ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "@xmath96 the band shown in fig .",
    "4 corresponds to the 60 sets of 59 configurations used in the jacknife evaluation .",
    "each of the curves shows an expansion .",
    "we do not compute a set of curves simply using the errors quoted in table 2 and table 3 .",
    "such a procedure would incorrectly ignore the correlations between the parameters @xmath59 , @xmath58 , and @xmath89 .",
    "a look at fig .",
    "4 shows us that the wave packet under investigation is not really small .",
    "according to fig .  4 , @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the ground state contibution .",
    "( in the fig .",
    "4 @xmath99 is represented by the solid horizontal line . )",
    "this is because we could recover only three out of the many states comprising the wave packet at the source @xmath53 .",
    "furthermore , even at @xmath53 the wave packet is not quite point like . as was mentioned above",
    ", there is a non - zero probability for the quark and the antiquark to be separated by some distance at the time they are created by the point interpolating field .",
    "these features make it difficult to define one number @xmath100 to typify the time for the wave packet to expand .",
    "one way is to define @xmath100 as the time it takes for @xmath36 to reach the ground state contribution @xmath99 .",
    "this expansion time is found to be @xmath101 fm , which is certainly much smaller than the root mean square radius of the pion @xmath102 fm here .",
    "however , this estimate is misleading , since the initial wave packet is not small .",
    "the initial wave packet size is determined by the coefficients @xmath58 as well as @xmath103 . here",
    "the set @xmath58 determines the spectral density of the operator @xmath104 .",
    "these numbers are only related to color transparency physics if they also represent the elastic and inelastic form factors .",
    "thus we are free to consider the consequences of using different values of @xmath58 .",
    "varying @xmath58 we can obtain an upper limit for the expansion time for the given energies @xmath59 and soft interaction matrix elements @xmath103 .",
    "this is achieved for @xmath105 and @xmath106 and equal to @xmath107 fm .",
    "the results for the other two hopping parameters are similar to the one shown in fig .  4 , but with bigger statistical error .",
    "for the purpose of our investigation we are not interested in taking the physical limit @xmath108 .",
    "the point is that the expansion time is determined by the energy differences @xmath109 as well as @xmath58 and @xmath89 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath58 and @xmath89 are virtually independent of the quark mass .",
    "the lowest value of the energy gap for a pion is much larger , than for a proton .",
    "by taking the physical limit to @xmath110 we only increase the mass gap and decrease the expansion time .",
    "there is one more point to be made .",
    "the subject of our investigation is the expansion of a wave packet in its rest frame .",
    "if color transparency is to be observed , it will be in a high momentum transfer reaction , when the escaping wave packet is moving with a speed close to the speed of light .",
    "time dilation will increase the expansion time .",
    "in fact , color transparency can be achieved for any small size wave packet , consisting of a finite number of states , as long as the momentum transfer is much greater than the energy of the states .",
    "a real plc produced in a high momentum transfer reaction consists of an infinite number of states .",
    "how the energy of the important states changes with the momentum transfer will decide the fate of color transparency .",
    "the expansion of a reduced size wave packet on the lattice is investigated .",
    "the wave packet is created with the pseudoscalar point interpolating field .",
    "the quantity representing the strength of the soft interaction of the expanding wave packet with the nucleus is measured as a function of the euclidean time .",
    "we treat the expanding wave packet as a coherent sum of physical states .",
    "most of the states decay away before we can detect them .",
    "the three lowest energy states we are able to recover allow for the formation of a reduced size wave packet . with the parameters of these states we are able to do the transition to the minkowsky time . a minkowsky time expansion picture is obtained .",
    "what is the importance of our work and where do we go from here ? for the first time three states - a ground state and two excited states- are obtained from the lattice calculations .",
    "( one may attempt to recover more excited states by using a smaller lattice spacing @xmath111 . )",
    "the matrix elements of the soft interaction between the ground state and the two excited states are important for color transparency .",
    "these are found to decay rapidly with energy .",
    "this feature is an important component of color transparency .",
    "( it would be useful to verify that similar results are obtained for baryons . ) furthermore , the present results show that a lattice evaluation of wave packet expansion is possible .    in the present results ,",
    "the initial wave packet is not small , and its relation to color transparency physics is unclear .",
    "our next step will be to attack this problem by studying the wave packet ( hopefully a plc ) created by the electromagnetic current operator .",
    "it is our pleasure to thank steven sharpe for useful discussions and encouragement .",
    "this work was supported in part by the u.s .",
    "department of energy .",
    "the lattice calculations were performed on the uw nuclear theory decstation 3000 - 600 axp .",
    "there have been several papers , in which the attention has been brought to the fact that the use of the full covariance matrix for the correlated data is unreliable for small data samples @xcite .",
    "we use a simple example to show analytically that there are instances , when the use of the diagonal part of a covariance matrix to fit data ( uncorrelated @xmath60 fit ) with a theoretical expression gives a better result than the full covariance matrix ( correlated @xmath60 fit ) , even in the limit of infinite number of samples .",
    "note that when we use the diagonal part , we fit _ correlated _ data and simply ignore the correlations among them .",
    "consider fitting results of the @xmath112 measurements of @xmath113 quantities @xmath114 by a constant i. we assume that all @xmath115 s @xmath116 do reach the same constant value @xmath117 in the limit @xmath118 and that the correct infinite @xmath112 form of the covariance matrix @xmath119 is known .",
    "then we can minimize @xmath60 , @xmath120 with respect to @xmath121 and find @xmath121 in two cases : @xmath122 , when the full covariance matrix @xmath123 is used , and @xmath124 , when only the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix @xmath123 are used .",
    "@xmath125    both @xmath122 and @xmath124 are unbiased estimators of the true value @xmath117 , since in the limit @xmath118 they both are equal to @xmath117 . the preference should be given to the estimator with the smaller standard deviation .",
    "results for @xmath122 and @xmath124 will vary from one set of @xmath112 samples to another with the variance @xmath126 equal to @xmath127 from this general form it is clear that we can not expect @xmath128 to be always true .",
    "consider a situation , when the diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath123 are much greater than nondiagonal : @xmath129 and we can expand @xmath130 to get for @xmath131 @xmath132 the uncorrelated fit yields better results in the case of prevailing positive correlations , the correlated fit is better in the case of prevailing negative correlations .",
    "but positive correlations do not necessarily render a correlated fit worse than uncorrelated one .",
    "consider a simple example of @xmath133 , when the expressions for @xmath131 and @xmath134 become transparent : @xmath135 again , as in the case of small correlations , a correlated fit is better for negative correlations @xmath136 .",
    "but there is a region of big positive correlations @xmath137 where a correlated fit gives better results .",
    "another issue is using @xmath60 to estimate how good a fit is . for",
    "the correlated fit the infinite @xmath112 limit of @xmath138 is @xmath139 , which is exactly 1 per degree of freedom . in the case of the uncorrelated",

    "<S> the opportunity to observe color transparency ( ct ) is determined by how rapidly a small - sized hadronic wave packet expands . </S>",
    "<S> here we use su(2 ) lattice gauge theory with wilson fermions in the quenched approximation to investigate the expansion . </S>",
    "<S> the wave packet is modeled by a point hadronic source , often used as an interpolating field in lattice calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure is to determine the euclidean time ( t ) , pion channel , bethe - salpeter amplitude @xmath0 , and then evaluate @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity represents the soft interaction of a small - sized wave packet with a pion . </S>",
    "<S> the time dependence of @xmath2 is fit as a superposition of three states , which is found sufficient to reproduce a reduced size wave packet . </S>",
    "<S> using this superposition allows us to make the analytic continuation required to study the wave packet expansion in real time . </S>",
