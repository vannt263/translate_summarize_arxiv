    "we get the decay rates and branching ratios in table 1 . in the calculation the b meson life time @xmath206 and @xmath207 are used , and the uncertainties arise from the quark and meson masses as well as the variation of the thresholds and the borel parameter .",
    "it is shown that the branching ratios in the @xmath18 limit can be about @xmath208 .",
    "however @xmath4 and @xmath5 may lead to nearly 20% suppression . when the contribution of @xmath209 is included , the branching ratios can even be significantly reduced .",
    "we note that the masses of @xmath11 charmed doublets have not been determined precisely .",
