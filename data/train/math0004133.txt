    "prediction is hard , especially when it comes to the future , but barring some unforeseen catastrophe , we can expect the amount of mathematics produced in the 21st century to dwarf that of all the centuries that came before . by the very nature of its subject matter ,",
    "mathematics is capable of limitless expansion .",
    "thanks to rapid improvements in technology , our computational power is in a phase of exponential growth . even if this growth slows , we have barely begun to exploit our new abilities .",
    "thus the interesting question is not whether the 21st century will see an unprecedented explosion of new mathematics .",
    "it is whether anyone will ever understand more than the tiniest fraction of this new mathematics  or even the mathematics we already have .",
    "will mathematics merely become more sophisticated and specialized , or will we find ways to drastically simplify and unify the subject ?",
    "will we only build on existing foundations , or will we also reexamine basic concepts and seek new starting - points ? surely there is no shortage of complicated and interesting things to do in mathematics .",
    "but it makes sense to spend at least a little time going back and thinking about _ simple _ things .",
    "this can be a bit embarrassing , because we feel we are supposed to understand these things completely already .",
    "but in fact we do not . and if we never face up to this fact , we will miss out on opportunities to make mathematics as beautiful and easy to understand as it deserves to be .",
    "for this reason , we will focus here on some very simple things , starting with the notion of equality .",
    "we will try to show that by taking pieces of elementary mathematics and _ categorifying _ them  replacing equations by isomorphisms  we can greatly enhance their power .",
    "the reason is that many familiar mathematical structures arise from a process of _ decategorification _ : turning categories into sets by pretending isomorphisms are equations .    in",
    "what follows , we start with a discussion of equality versus isomorphism , and a brief foray into @xmath1-categories and homotopy theory . then we describe in detail how the natural numbers and the familiar operations of arithmetic arise from decategorifying the category of finite sets .",
    "this suggests that a deeper approach to arithmetic would work not with natural numbers but directly with finite sets .",
    "this philosophy has already been pursued in many directions , especially within combinatorics .",
    "as an example , we describe how formal power series rise from decategorifying andr joyal s ` structure types ' , or ` espces de structures ' @xcite .",
    "a structure type is any sort of structure on finite sets that transforms naturally under permutations ; counting the structures of a given type that can be put on a set with @xmath1 elements is one of the basic problems of combinatorics .",
    "we also describe a useful generalization of structure types , which we call ` stuff types ' .",
    "to hint at some future possibilities , we conclude by showing how to understand some combinatorial aspects of quantum theory using stuff types .",
    "first we define an inner product of stuff types and note that , with this inner product , the category of stuff types becomes a categorified version of the hilbert space of a quantized harmonic oscillator .",
    "then we show that the theory of feynman diagrams arises naturally from the study of ` stuff operators ' , which are gadgets that turn one stuff type into another in a linear sort of way .",
    "one of the most fundamental notions in mathematics is that of _",
    "equality_. for the most part we take it for granted : we say an equation expresses the identity of a thing and itself .",
    "but the curious thing is that an equation is only interesting or useful to the extent that the two sides are _ different ! _ the one equation that truly expresses identity , @xmath2 is precisely the one that is completely boring and useless .",
    "interesting equations do not merely express the identity of a thing and itself ; instead , they hint at the existence of a reversible transformation that takes us from the quantity on one side to the quantity on the other .    to make this more precise , we need the concept of a category .",
    "a set has elements , and two elements are either equal or not  it s a yes - or - no business . a category is a subtler structure : it has objects but also morphisms between objects , which we can compose in an associative way .",
    "every object @xmath3 has an identity morphism @xmath4 which serves as a left and right unit for composition ; this morphism describes the process of going from @xmath3 to @xmath3 by doing nothing at all . but more interestingly",
    ", we say a morphism @xmath5 is an _ isomorphism _ if there is a morphism @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "an isomorphism describes a reversible transformation going from @xmath3 to @xmath8 .",
    "isomorphism is not a yes - or - no business , because two objects can be isomorphic in more than one way .",
    "indeed , the notion of ` symmetry ' arises precisely from the fact that an object can be isomorphic to itself in many ways : for any object @xmath3 , the set of isomorphisms @xmath9 forms a group called its symmetry group or _ automorphism group _ , @xmath10 .",
    "now , given a category @xmath11 , we may ` decategorify ' it by forgetting about the morphisms and pretending that isomorphic objects are equal .",
    "we are left with a set ( or class ) whose elements are isomorphism classes of objects of @xmath11 .",
    "this process is dangerous , because it destroys useful information .",
    "it amounts to forgetting which road we took from @xmath3 to @xmath8 , and just remembering that we got there .",
    "sometimes this is actually useful , but most of the time people do it unconsciously , out of mathematical naivete .",
    "we write equations , when we really should specify isomorphisms .",
    "` categorification ' is the attempt to undo this mistake . like any attempt to restore lost information , it not a completely systematic process .",
    "its importance is that it brings to light previously hidden mathematical structures , and clarifies things that would otherwise remain mysterious .",
    "it seems strange and complicated at first , but ultimately the goal is to make things simpler .",
    "we like to illustrate this with the parable of the shepherd .",
    "long ago , when shepherds wanted to see if two herds of sheep were isomorphic , they would look for a specific isomorphism .",
    "in other words , they would line up both herds and try to match each sheep in one herd with a sheep in the other .",
    "but one day , a shepherd invented decategorification .",
    "she realized one could take each herd and ` count ' it , setting up an isomorphism between it and a set of ` numbers ' , which were nonsense words like ` one , two , three ,  ' specially designed for this purpose . by comparing the resulting numbers",
    ", she could show that two herds were isomorphic without explicitly establishing an isomorphism ! in short , the set @xmath12 of natural numbers was created by decategorifying @xmath13 , the category whose objects are finite sets and whose morphisms are functions between these .    starting with the natural numbers ,",
    "the shepherds then invented the basic operations of arithmetic by decategorifying important operations on finite sets : disjoint union , cartesian product , and so on .",
    "we describe this in detail in the next section .",
    "later , their descendants found it useful to extend @xmath12 to larger number systems with better formal properties : the integers , the rationals , the real and complex numbers , and so on .",
    "these make it easier to prove a vast range of theorems , even theorems that are just about natural numbers .",
    "but in the process , the original connection to the category of finite sets was obscured .",
    "now we are in the position of having an enormous body of mathematics , large parts of which are _ secretly _ the decategorified residues of deeper truths , without knowing exactly which parts these are .",
    "for example , any equation involving natural numbers may be the decategorification of an isomorphism between finite sets . in combinatorics , when people find an isomorphism explaining such an equation , they say they have found a ` bijective proof ' of it .",
    "but decategorification lurks in many other places as well , and wherever we find it , we have the opportunity to understand things more deeply by going back and categorifying : working with objects directly , rather than their isomorphism classes .",
    "for example , the ` representation ring ' of a group is a decategorified version of its category of representations , with characters serving as stand - ins for the representations themselves .",
    "the ` burnside ring ' of a group is a decategorified version of its category of actions on finite sets .",
    "the ` k - theory ' of a topological space is a decategorified version of the category of vector bundles over this space . and",
    "the ` picard group ' of a variety is obtained by decategorifying the category of line bundles over this variety . in all mathematics involving these ideas and their many generalizations ,",
    "there is room for categorification .    actually ,",
    "in the first three examples above , decategorification has been followed by the process of adjoining formal additive inverses , just as we obtained the integers by first decategorifying @xmath13 and then adjoining the negative numbers .",
    "apart from ignorance of categories , the desire for additive inverses may be the main reason mathematicians indulge in decategorification .",
    "this makes it very important to understand additive inverses in the categorified context .",
    "we touch upon this issue in the next section .    when one digs more deeply into categorification , one quickly hits upon homotopy theory .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "starting with a topological space @xmath14 , we can form a category @xmath15 whose objects are the points of @xmath14 and whose morphisms @xmath16 are homotopy classes of paths from @xmath3 to @xmath8 .",
    "this category is a _ groupoid _ , meaning that all its morphisms are isomorphisms @xcite .",
    "we call it the _ fundamental groupoid _ of @xmath14 .",
    "if we decategorify @xmath15 , we obtain the set @xmath17 of path components of @xmath14 .",
    "note that @xmath15 is far more informative than @xmath17 , because it records not just whether one can get from here to there , but also a bit about the path taken .",
    "in fact , one can make quite precise the sense in which @xmath18 is a stronger invariant than @xmath19 .",
    "we say @xmath14 is a _",
    "homotopy @xmath1-type _ if it is locally well - behaved ( e.g.  a cw complex ) and any continuous map @xmath20 is contractible to a point when @xmath21 . if @xmath14 is a homotopy 0-type , we can classify it up to homotopy equivalence using @xmath17 .",
    "this is not true if @xmath14 is a homotopy 1-type .",
    "however , if @xmath14 is a homotopy 1-type , we can classify it up to homotopy equivalence using @xmath15 .",
    "there is a suggestive pattern here . to see how it continues , we need to categorify the notion of category itself",
    "this gives the concept of a ` 2-category ' or ` bicategory ' @xcite .",
    "we will not give the full definitions here , but the basic idea is that a 2-category has objects , morphisms between objects , and also 2-morphisms between morphisms , like this :    = 1.0 in    just as a category allows us to distinguish between equality and isomorphism for objects , a 2-category allows us to make this distinction for morphisms .    from any space @xmath14",
    "we can form a 2-category @xmath22 whose objects are points of @xmath14 , whose 1-morphisms are paths in @xmath14 , and whose 2-morphisms are homotopy classes of ` paths of paths ' .",
    "in fact this 2-category is a _",
    "2-groupoid _ , meaning that every 2-morphism is invertible and every morphism is invertible up to a 2-morphism .",
    "we call @xmath22 the",
    "_ fundamental 2-groupoid _ of @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath14 is a homotopy 2-type , we can classify it up to homotopy equivalence using @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , if we decategorify @xmath22 by treating homotopic paths as equal , we get back @xmath15 .    going still further",
    ", grothendieck @xcite proposed that if we take the notion of ` set ' and categorify it @xmath1 times , we should obtain a notion of _ @xmath1-category _ : a structure with objects , morphisms between objects , 2-morphisms between morphisms and so on up to @xmath1-morphisms .",
    "any space @xmath14 should give us an @xmath1-category @xmath23 whose objects are the points of @xmath14 , whose morphisms are paths in @xmath14 , whose 2-morphisms are paths of paths , and so on ... with the @xmath1-morphisms being homotopy classes of @xmath1-fold paths . in this @xmath1-category",
    "all the @xmath24-morphisms are _ equivalences _ , meaning that for @xmath25 that they are invertible , while for @xmath26 they are invertible up to equivalence .",
    "we call an @xmath1-category with this property an _ @xmath1-groupoid_. given any decent definition of @xmath1-categories , @xmath1-groupoids should be essentially the same as homotopy @xmath1-types .    in short , by iterated categorification ,",
    "the whole of homotopy theory should spring forth naturally from pure algebra !",
    "this dream is well on its way to being realized , but it still holds many challenges for mathematics .",
    "various definitions of @xmath1-category have been proposed @xcite , and for some of these the notion of fundamental @xmath1-groupoid has already been explored .",
    "however , nobody has yet shown that these different definitions are equivalent . finding a clear treatment of @xmath1-categories is a major task for the century to come .",
    "starting from the realization that the set of natural numbers is obtained by decategorifying @xmath13 , let us see how the basic operations of arithmetic have their origins in the theory of finite sets .",
    "first of all , addition in @xmath12 arises from disjoint union of finite sets , since @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the disjoint union of the finite sets @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "however , it is worth noting that there is really no such thing as ` the ' disjoint union of two sets @xmath29 and @xmath30 ! before forming their union , we must use some trick to ensure that they are disjoint , such as replacing the elements @xmath31 by ordered pairs @xmath32 and replacing the elements @xmath33 by ordered pairs @xmath34 .",
    "but there are many tricks we could use here , and it would be unfair , even tyrannical , to demand that everybody use the same one . if we allow freedom of choice in this matter , we should really speak of ` a ' disjoint union of @xmath29 and @xmath30 . but this raises the question of exactly what counts as a disjoint union !",
    "this question has an elegant and , at first encounter , rather surprising answer .",
    "a disjoint union of sets @xmath29 and @xmath30 is not just a set ; it is a set @xmath28 equipped with maps @xmath35 and @xmath36 saying how @xmath29 and @xmath30 are included in it .",
    "moreover , these maps must satisfy the following universal property : for any maps @xmath37 and @xmath38 , there must be a unique map @xmath39 making this diagram commute : @xmath40 \\node{s } \\arrow{se , b}{i } \\arrow{ese , t}{f } \\\\",
    "\\node[2]{s+t } \\arrow{e , t}{h }   \\node{x }   \\\\ \\node{t } \\arrow{ne , t}{j } \\arrow{ene , b}{g }   \\end{diagram}\\ ] ] in other words , a map from a disjoint union of @xmath29 and @xmath30 to some set contains the same information as a pair of maps from @xmath29 and @xmath30 to that set .",
    "the wonderful thing about this definition is that now , if you have your disjoint union and i have mine , we automatically get maps going both ways between the two , and a little fiddling shows that these maps are inverses . (",
    "if you have never seen this done , you should do it yourself right now . )",
    "thus , while there is not a _",
    "unique _ disjoint union of sets , any two disjoint unions are _ canonically isomorphic_. experience has shown that knowing a set up to canonical isomorphism is just as good as knowing it exactly .",
    "for this reason , we may actually speak of ` the ' disjoint union of sets , so long as we bear in mind that we are using the word ` the ' in a generalized sense here .    defining disjoint unions by a universal property this way",
    "has a number of advantages .",
    "first , it allows freedom of choice without risking a descent into chaos , because it automatically ensures compatibility between different tricks for constructing disjoint unions . with the rise of computer technology ,",
    "the importance of this sort of ` implementation - independence ' has become very clear : for easy interfacing , we need to be able to ignore the gritty details of _ how _ things are done , but we can only do this if we have a clear specification of _ what _ is being done .",
    "second , since the above definition of disjoint union relies only upon the apparatus of commutative diagrams , it instantly generalizes . given two objects @xmath41 and @xmath42 in any category",
    ", we define their _ coproduct _ to be an object @xmath43 equipped with morphisms @xmath44 , @xmath45 such that for any morphisms @xmath46 , @xmath47 there exists a unique morphism @xmath48 making this diagram commute : @xmath49 \\node{a } \\arrow{se , b}{i } \\arrow{ese , t}{f } \\\\ \\node[2]{a+b } \\arrow{e , t}{h }   \\node{x }   \\\\ \\node{b } \\arrow{ne , t}{j } \\arrow{ene , b}{g }   \\end{diagram}\\ ] ] the coproduct may or may not exist , but when it does , it is unique up to canonical isomorphism .",
    "for example , the coproduct of topological spaces is their disjoint union with its usual topology , while the coproduct of groups is their free product .",
    "this realization , and others like it , help us save time by simultaneously proving theorems for all categories instead of one category at a time .",
    "as our discussion has shown , addition of natural numbers is just a decategorified version of the coproduct of finite sets .",
    "what about multiplication ?",
    "this is a decategorified version of the cartesian product : @xmath50 like the disjoint union , the cartesian product is really defined only up to canonical isomorphism : we say @xmath51 is the set of ordered pairs @xmath52 with @xmath31 and @xmath33 , but if you carefully examine the set - theoretic fine print , you will see that there is some choice involved in defining ordered pairs !",
    "von neumann had the clever idea of defining @xmath52 to be the set @xmath53 .",
    "this trick gets the job done , but there is nothing sacrosanct about it , so in long run it turns out to be better to define cartesian products via a universal property .    in this approach",
    ", we say a cartesian product of @xmath29 and @xmath30 is any set @xmath51 equipped with maps @xmath54 , @xmath55 such that for any maps @xmath56 and @xmath57 , there is a unique map @xmath58 making this diagram commute : @xmath59 \\node{s }   \\\\ \\node[2]{s \\times t } \\arrow{nw , b}{p } \\arrow{sw , t}{q }   \\node{x } \\arrow{w , t}{h } \\arrow{wnw , t}{f } \\arrow{wsw , b}{g } \\\\ \\node{t }   \\end{diagram}\\ ] ] again , thanks to the magic of universal properties , this definition determines the cartesian product up to canonical isomorphism . and again , we can straightforwardly generalize this definition to any category , obtaining the notion of a _ product _ of objects .",
    "for example , the product of topological spaces is their cartesian product with the product topology , while the product of groups is their cartesian product with operations defined componentwise .",
    "now let us see how the basic laws satisfied by addition and multiplication in @xmath12 come from properties of @xmath13 .",
    "the natural numbers form a _ rig _ under addition and multiplication : that is , a ` ring without negatives ' .",
    "we thus expect @xmath13 to be some sort of categorified version of a rig .",
    "in fact , the definition of coproduct automatically implies that it is commutative and associative up to canonical isomorphism .",
    "( again , anyone who has not seen the proof should prove this right now ! )",
    "since the definition of product is obtained simply by turning all the arrows around , the same arguments show the commutativity and associativity of the product . on the other hand ,",
    "the distributivity of products over coproducts is _ not _ an automatic consequence of general abstract nonsense ; this is really a special feature of @xmath13 and a class of related categories .",
    "what about 0 and 1 ? in any category , we say an object @xmath14 is _ initial _ if there is a unique morphism from @xmath14 to any object in the category .",
    "dually , we say @xmath14 is _ terminal _ if there is a unique morphism from any object in the category to @xmath14 .",
    "since these definitions are based on universal properties , initial and terminal objects are unique up to canonical isomorphism when they exist . in @xmath13 ,",
    "the empty set is initial and the 1-element set  i.e. , _ any _ 1-element set  is terminal .",
    "we shall call these sets 0 and 1 , because they play the same role in @xmath13 that the numbers 0 and 1 do in @xmath12 . in particular , it is easy to see that in any category with an initial object @xmath60 , we have a canonical isomorphism @xmath61 turning the arrows around , the same argument shows that in any category with a terminal object @xmath62 , we have a canonical isomorphism @xmath63    in short , @xmath13 is a categorified version of a commutative rig , with all the usual laws holding up to canonical isomorphism .",
    "moreover , these isomorphisms satisfy various ` coherence laws ' which allow us to manipulate them with the ease of equations .",
    "we thus call @xmath13 a _ symmetric rig category _ ; for details , see the work of kelly @xcite and laplaza @xcite .",
    "many of the categories that mathematicians like are symmetric rig categories .",
    "often the addition and multiplication are given by coproduct and product , but not always .",
    "for example , the category of vector spaces is a symmetric rig category with direct sum as addition and tensor product as multiplication .",
    "the direct sum of vector spaces is the coproduct , but their tensor product is not their product in the category - theoretic sense .",
    "the most primitive example of a symmmetric rig category is actually not @xmath13 but @xmath64 , the subcategory whose objects are all the finite sets but whose morphisms are just the bijections .",
    "disjoint union and cartesian product still serve as ` addition ' and ` multiplication ' in this smaller category , even though they are not the coproduct and product anymore .",
    "the decategorification of @xmath64 is still @xmath12 , and @xmath64 plays a role in the theory of symmetric rig categories very much like that @xmath12 plays in the theory of commutative rigs , or @xmath65 plays in the more familiar theory of commutative rings . in the next section , we shall see more of the importance of @xmath64 .",
    "having categorified the natural numbers , it is tempting to categorify other number systems : the integers , rational numbers , the real numbers and so on .",
    "for quantum mechanics it might be nice to categorify the complex numbers ! however , there are already severe difficulties with categorifying the integers",
    ". doing this would be like inventing ` sets with negative cardinality ' . however , there are strong limitations on our ability to cook up a category where objects have ` additive inverses ' with respect to coproduct .",
    "for suppose the object @xmath14 has an object @xmath66 satisfying @xmath67 where @xmath60 is the initial object .",
    "then for any object @xmath68 there is only one morphism from @xmath69 to @xmath68 . but",
    "a morphism of this sort is the same as a morphism from @xmath66 to @xmath68 together with a morphism from @xmath14 to @xmath68 .",
    "this means that both @xmath14 and @xmath66 are initial ! in short , @xmath70    this does not mean that categorifying the integers is doomed to fail ; it just means that we must take a more generous attitude towards what counts as success .",
    "schanuel @xcite has proposed one approach ; joyal @xcite and the authors @xcite have advocated another , based on ideas from homotopy theory .",
    "briefly , it goes like this . given a symmetric rig category @xmath71",
    ", we can form its underlying groupoid @xmath72 : that is , the subcategory with all the same objects but only the isomorphisms as morphisms .",
    "this groupoid inherits the structure of a symmetric rig category from @xmath71 .",
    "since groupoids are essentially the same as homotopy 1-types , we can form a homotopy 1-type @xmath73 , called the _ classifying space _ of @xmath72 , whose fundamental groupoid is equivalent to @xmath72 . with suitable tinkering ,",
    "we can use the addition in @xmath72 to make @xmath73 into a topological monoid @xcite . then , by a well - known process called ` group completion ' @xcite , we can adjoin additive inverses and obtain a topological group @xmath74 . thanks to the multiplication in @xmath72 , @xmath74 has a structure much like that of a commutative ring , but with the usual laws holding only up to homotopy .",
    "homotopy theorists call this sort of thing an ` @xmath75 ring space ' @xcite .",
    "if we perform this series of constructions starting with @xmath13 , we obtain the @xmath75 ring space @xmath76 where the space on the right is a kind of limit of the @xmath1-fold loop space @xmath77 as @xmath78 .",
    "this space is fundamental to a branch of mathematics called stable homotopy theory @xcite .",
    "it has nonvanishing homotopy groups in arbitrarily high dimensions , so we should really think of it as an ` @xmath79-groupoid ' .",
    "what this means is that to properly categorify subtraction , we need to categorify not just once but infinitely many times !    seeing the deep waters we have gotten ourselves into here , we might be a bit afraid to go on and categorify division .",
    "however , historically the negative numbers were invented quite a bit after the nonnegative rational numbers  in stark contrast to the usual textbook presentation in which @xmath65 comes before @xmath80 .",
    "apparently half an apple is easier to understand than a negative apple !",
    "this suggests that perhaps ` sets with fractional cardinality ' are simpler than ` sets with negative cardinality ' . and in fact , they are .",
    "the key is to think carefully about the actual meaning of division . the usual way to get half",
    "an apple is to chop one into ` two equal parts ' .",
    "of course , the parts are actually _ not equal _  if they were , there would be only one part !",
    "they are merely _",
    "isomorphic_. so what we really have is a @xmath81 symmetry group acting on the apple which interchanges the two isomorphic parts .",
    "similarly , if a group @xmath82 acts on a set @xmath29 , we can ` divide ' the set by the group by taking the quotient @xmath83 , whose points are the orbits of the action . if @xmath29 and @xmath82 are finite and @xmath82 acts freely on @xmath29 , this construction really corresponds to division , since @xmath84 .",
    "however , it is crucial that the action be free .",
    "for example , why is @xmath85 ? we can take a 6-element set @xmath29 with a free action of the group @xmath86 and identify all the elements in each orbit to obtain a 3-element set @xmath83 :    = 1.0 in    pictorially , this amounts to folding the set @xmath29 in half , so it is not surprising that @xmath84 in this case .",
    "unfortunately , if we try a similar trick starting with a 5-element set , it fails miserably :    = 1.0 in    we do nt obtain a set with @xmath87 elements , because the group action is not free : the point in the middle gets mapped to itself . to define ` sets with fractional cardinality '",
    ", we need a way to count the point in the middle as ` half a point ' .",
    "to do this , we should first find a better way to define the quotient of @xmath29 by @xmath82 when the action fails to be free .",
    "following the policy of replacing equations by isomorphisms , let us define the _ weak quotient _",
    "@xmath88 to be the category with elements of @xmath29 as its objects , with a morphism @xmath89 whenever @xmath90 , and with composition of morphisms defined in the obvious way .",
    "the figures above are really just pictures of such categories  but to reduce clutter , we did not draw the identity morphisms .",
    "next , let us figure out a good way to define the ` cardinality ' of a category .",
    "pondering the examples above leads us to the following recipe : for each isomorphism class of objects we pick a representative @xmath3 and compute the reciprocal of the number of automorphisms of this object ; then we sum over isomorphism classes . in short : @xmath91 } { 1\\over |{{\\rm aut}}(x)| } \\;.\\ ] ] it is easy to see that with this definition , the point in the middle of the previous picture gets counted as ` half a point ' , so we get a category with cardinality @xmath87 . in general ,",
    "@xmath92 whenever @xmath82 is a finite group acting on a finite set @xmath29 .",
    "in fact , this formula can be viewed as a simplified version of ` burnside s lemma ' , which gives the cardinality of the ordinary quotient instead of the better - behaved weak quotient @xcite .",
    "the cardinality of a category @xmath11 is a well - defined nonnegative rational number whenever @xmath11 has finitely many isomorphism classes of objects and each object has finitely many automorphisms .",
    "more generally , we can make sense of @xmath93 whenever the sum defining it converges ; we call categories for which this is true _",
    "tame_.    here are some easily checked and reassuring facts about these notions",
    ". any category equivalent to a tame category is tame , and equivalent tame categories have the same cardinality .",
    "moreover , one can define the ` coproduct ' and ` product ' of categories in the usual way ; these operations preserve tameness , and if @xmath11 and @xmath94 are tame categories we have @xmath95 finally , there is a standard trick for thinking of sets as special categories : given a set @xmath29 we form the _ discrete category _ whose objects are the elements of @xmath29 and whose morphisms are all identity morphisms .",
    "as one would hope , applying this trick to a finite set gives a tame category with the same cardinality .    in the next section",
    "we describe a way to compute the cardinality of a large class of tame categories  the tame categories whose objects are finite sets equipped with extra structure .",
    "the simplest example is the category of finite sets itself !",
    "a simple computation gives the following marvelous formula : @xmath96 it would be nice to find a natural category whose cardinality involves @xmath97 , but so far our examples along these lines are rather artificial .",
    "the cardinality of a category @xmath11 equals that of its underlying groupoid @xmath98 .",
    "this suggests that this notion really deserves the name _",
    "groupoid cardinality_. it also suggests that we should generalize this notion to @xmath1-groupoids , or even @xmath79-groupoids .",
    "luckily , we do nt need to understand @xmath79-groupoids very well to try our hand at this !",
    "whatever @xmath79-groupoids are , they are supposed to be an algebraic way of thinking about topological spaces up to homotopy .",
    "thus we just need to invent a concept of the ` cardinality ' of a topological space which has nice formal properties and which agrees with the groupoid cardinality in the case of homotopy 1-types .",
    "in fact , this is not hard to do .",
    "the key is to use the homotopy groups @xmath99 of the space @xmath14 .",
    "the _ homotopy cardinality _ of a topological space @xmath14 is defined as the alternating product @xmath100 when @xmath14 is connected and the product converges ; if @xmath14 is not connected , we define its homotopy cardinality to be the sum of the homotopy cardinalities of its connected components , when the sum converges .",
    "we call spaces with well - defined homotopy cardinality _ tame_. the product or coproduct of two tame spaces is again tame , and we have @xmath101 just as one would hope .    even better , homotopy cardinality gets along well with fibrations , which we can think of as ` twisted products ' of spaces .",
    "namely , if @xmath102 is a fibration and the base space @xmath42 is connected , we have @xmath103 whenever two of the three spaces in question are tame ( which implies the tameness of the third ) .",
    "this fact is an easy consequence of the long exact homotopy sequence @xmath104    as an application of this fact , recall that any topological group @xmath82 has a _ classifying space _ @xmath105 , meaning a space with a principal @xmath82-bundle over it @xmath106 whose total space @xmath107 is contractible . since @xmath107 is contractible it is tame , and @xmath108 .",
    "thus @xmath82 is tame if and only if @xmath105 is , and @xmath109 in other words , we can think of @xmath105 as a kind of ` reciprocal ' of @xmath82 .",
    "this curious idea is already lurking in the usual approach to equivariant cohomology .",
    "suppose @xmath14 is a space on which the topological group @xmath82 acts .",
    "when the action of @xmath82 on @xmath14 is free , it is fun to calculate cohomology groups ( and other invariants ) of the quotient space @xmath110 .",
    "when the action is not free , this quotient can be very pathological , so people usually replace it by the _ homotopy quotient _ @xmath111",
    "a careful examination of this construction shows that instead of identifying points of @xmath14 that lie in the same @xmath82-orbit , we are sewing in paths between them  thus following the dictum of replacing equations by isomorphisms , or more generally , equivalences .",
    "there is a fibration @xmath112 so when @xmath14 and @xmath82 are tame we have @xmath113 just as one would hope .",
    "in combinatorics , a standard problem is to count the number of structures of a given type that can be put on a finite set . for example , the number of ways to linearly order an @xmath1-element set is @xmath114 , while the number of ways to partition it into disjoint nonempty subsets is some more complicated function of @xmath1 .",
    "such counting problems can often be solved with almost magical ease using formal power series @xcite .",
    "the idea is simple .",
    "let @xmath115 be any type of structure that we can put on finite sets , and let @xmath116 be the set of all structures of this type that can be put on your favorite @xmath1-element set ( which we will simply call ` @xmath1 ' ) .",
    "define the _ generating function _ of @xmath115 to be the formal power series @xmath117 using this definition , operations on structure types correspond to operations on their generating functions .",
    "for example , suppose we have two structure types @xmath115 and @xmath82 .",
    "then we can make up a new structure type @xmath118 by saying that a structure of type @xmath118 on a finite set is the same as a structure of type @xmath115 or a structure of type @xmath82 on this set .",
    "we count the structures of these two types as disjoint , so number of ways to put a structure of type @xmath118 on the @xmath1-element set is @xmath119 we thus have the following relation between generating functions : @xmath120    similarly , we can make up a structure type @xmath121 as follows : to put a structure of type @xmath121 on a finite set , we first choose a way to chop this set into two disjoint parts , and then put a structure of type @xmath115 on the first part and a structure of type @xmath82 on the second part .",
    "the number of ways to do this for the @xmath1-element set is @xmath122",
    "so a little calculation shows that @xmath123    simple structure types have simple power series as their generating functions .",
    "for example , consider the _ impossible structure _ : by definition , there are no ways to put this structure on any set .",
    "if we use use @xmath60 to stand for the impossible structure , we have @xmath124 for that matter , consider the structure of _ being the empty set_. there is one way to put this struture on a set with 0 elements , and no ways to put it on a set with @xmath1 elements when @xmath125 , so the generating function of this stucture type is just the power series @xmath62 .",
    "if we call this structure type ` 1 ' , we thus have @xmath126 more generally , the structure of _ being an @xmath1-element set _ has the generating function @xmath127 .",
    "it follows that the _ vacuous structure _  the structure of ` being a finite set '  has the generating function @xmath128    let us use these ideas to count something .",
    "let @xmath42 denote the structure type of binary rooted trees @xcite .",
    "for example , here is a way to put a structure of type @xmath42 on the set @xmath129 :    = 1.8 in    we can recursively define @xmath42 as follows . first , there is exactly one way to put a structure of type @xmath42 on the empty set .",
    "second , to put a structure of type @xmath42 on nonempty finite set @xmath29 , we pick an element @xmath130 called the _ root _ , chop the set @xmath131 into two parts @xmath132 and @xmath71 called the _ left and right subtrees _ , and put a structure of type @xmath42 on @xmath132 and on @xmath71 . translating this definition into an equation using the method described above",
    ", we have @xmath133 in short : a binary rooted tree is either the empty set or a one - element set together with two binary rooted trees ! thanks to the way things are set up , this equation gives rise to an identical - looking equation for the generating function @xmath134 : @xmath135 now comes the miracle .",
    "we can _ solve _ this equation for @xmath134 : @xmath136 and doing a taylor expansion we get : @xmath137 the coefficients of this series are called the _ catalan numbers _ , @xmath138 : @xmath139 a little messing around with the binomial theorem shows that @xmath140 so the number of ways to put a binary rooted tree structure on the @xmath1-element set is @xmath141    what is really going on here ?",
    "joyal clarified the subject immensely by giving a precise definition of the ` structure types ' we have already been using here in an informal way .",
    "a _ structure type _ is a functor @xmath142 .",
    "for the reader who is not comfortable with functors , we can spell out exactly what this means .",
    "first , a structure type assigns to any finite set @xmath29 a set @xmath143 , which we think of as the set of all structures of type @xmath115 on @xmath29 .",
    "second , it assigns to any bijection @xmath144 a map @xmath145 .",
    "these maps describe how structures of type @xmath115 transform under bijections .",
    "third , we require that @xmath146 whenever @xmath147 and @xmath148 are composable .",
    "structure types form a category where the morphisms are ` natural transformations ' between functors  any decent book on category theory will explain what these are @xcite , but it does nt much matter here . the category of structure types , which we call @xmath149 , is a kind of categorified version of the rig of formal power series @xmath150 we have already seen how any structure type @xmath115 determines a formal power series @xmath151 .",
    "in fact , the category @xmath149 is a symmetric rig category with the addition and multiplication operations already mentioned . as a result ,",
    "its decategorification is a commutative ring .",
    "this commutative ring is not @xmath152 , since the isomorphism class of a structure type @xmath115 contains more information than the numbers @xmath153 .",
    "however , there is a homomorphism from the decategorification of @xmath149 onto @xmath152 .",
    "in fact , one can make the analogy between power series and structure types very precise @xcite .",
    "but instead of doing this here , let us give an illustration of just how far the analogy goes .",
    "suppose @xmath115 is a structure type and @xmath14 is a finite set .",
    "define the groupoid @xmath154 as follows : @xmath155 here @xmath114 stands for the group of permutations of the set @xmath1 .",
    "this group acts on @xmath116 thanks to the definition of structure type , and it also acts on @xmath156 in an obvious way , so we can form the weak quotient @xmath157 , which is a groupoid . taking the coproduct of all these groupoids , we get @xmath154 .",
    "this is the categorified version of evaluating a power series at a number .",
    "but unlike the case of ordinary power series , there is no issue of convergence !",
    "the issue of convergence arises only when we decategorify .",
    "since groupoid cardinality gets along nicely with coproducts and weak quotients , we have the formula @xmath158 whenever both sides make sense .",
    "the left - hand side makes sense when the groupoid @xmath154 is tame .",
    "the right - hand side makes sense when the power series @xmath159 converges at @xmath160 .",
    "these two conditions are actually equivalent .",
    "this formula is good for calculating groupoid cardinalities .",
    "the groupoid @xmath161 is particularly interesting because it is equivalent to the groupoid of _ @xmath115-structured finite sets_. the objects of this groupoid are finite sets equipped with a structure of type @xmath115 , and the morphisms are structure - preserving bijections . when this groupoid is tame , its cardinality is @xmath162 .",
    "for example , if @xmath115 is the vacuous structure , its generating function is @xmath163 , and @xmath161 is the groupoid of finite sets .",
    "thus the cardinality of this groupoid is @xmath164 , as we have already seen . for a more interesting example , take a structure of type @xmath165 on a finite set to be a partition into disjoint nonempty subsets .",
    "then @xmath166 so the cardinality of the groupoid of finite sets equipped with a partition is @xmath167 . on the other hand ,",
    "the groupoid of binary rooted trees is not tame , because the power series @xmath168 diverges at @xmath169 . by analytic continuation",
    "using the formula @xmath170 one might assign this groupoid a cardinality of @xmath171 , ignoring the issue of branch cuts .",
    "these ` analytically continued cardinalities ' have interesting properties , but it is far from clear what they mean !    finally , let us mention some interesting generalizations of structure types .",
    "as we have seen , any structure type @xmath115 determines a groupoid @xmath161 , the groupoid of @xmath115-structured finite sets .",
    "there is a functor @xmath172 sending each @xmath115-structured finite set to its underlying set .",
    "it turns out that this functor contains all the information in the structure type .",
    "given suitable finiteness conditions , everything we have said about structure types actually works for any groupoid @xmath82 equipped with a functor @xmath173 . since the objects of @xmath82 can be thought of as finite sets together with extra `",
    "stuff ' , we call a groupoid equipped with a functor to @xmath13 a _ stuff type_. for a good example of a stuff type that is not a structure type , take @xmath82 to be the groupoid whose objects are ordered @xmath1-tuples of finite sets and whose morphisms are ordered @xmath1-tuples of bijections , and let @xmath174 be the projection onto one entry . as we shall see in the next section , stuff types are important for understanding the combinatorics of feynman diagrams .    in fact , we can categorify the concept of ` stuff type ' infinitely many times !",
    "if we do , we ultimately reach the notion of a space equipped with a continuous function to the classifying space @xmath175 .",
    "this notion allows for a fascinating interplay between feynman diagrams and homotopy theory .",
    "unfortunately , for the details the reader will have to turn elsewhere @xcite .",
    "from here we could go in various directions .",
    "but since we are dreaming about the future of mathematics , let us choose a rather speculative one , and discuss some applications of categorification to _",
    "quantum theory_. by now it is clear that categorification is necessary for understanding the connections between quantum field theory and topology . it has even played a role in some attempts to find a quantum theory of gravity . but having reviewed these subjects elsewhere @xcite , we restrict ourselves here to some of the simplest aspects of quantum physics .    one of the first steps in developing quantum theory was planck s new treatment of electromagnetic radiation . classically , electromagnetic radiation in a box can be described as a collection of harmonic oscillators , one for each vibrational mode of the field in the box .",
    "planck ` quantized ' the electromagnetic field by assuming that energy of each oscillator could only take the discrete values @xmath176 , where @xmath1 is a natural number , @xmath79 is the frequency of the oscillator in question , and @xmath177 is a constant now known as planck s constant .",
    "planck did not really know what to make of the number @xmath1 , but einstein and others subsequently interpreted it as the number of ` photons ' occupying the vibrational mode in question .",
    "however , far from being particles in the traditional sense of tiny billiard balls , these photons are curiously abstract entities  for example , all the photons occupying a given mode are indistinguishable from each other .",
    "the treatment of this subject was originally quite ad hoc , but with further work the underlying mathematics gradually became clearer .",
    "it turns out that states of a quantized harmonic oscillator can be described as vectors in a hilbert space called ` fock space ' .",
    "this hilbert space consists of formal power series in a single variable @xmath3 that have finite norm with respect to a certain inner product . for a full treatment of the electromagnetic field we would need power series in many variables , one for each vibrational mode , but to keep things simple",
    "let us consider just a single mode .",
    "then the power series @xmath62 corresponds to the state in which no photons occupy this mode .",
    "more generally , the power series @xmath127 corresponds to a state with @xmath1 photons present .",
    "now , the relation between power series and structure types suggests an odd notion : perhaps @xmath149 is a kind of categorified version of fock space ! this notion becomes a bit more plausible when one recalls that the power series @xmath127 correspond to the structure type of being an @xmath1-element set .",
    "in fact , if we think about it carefully , what einstein really did was to categorify planck s mysterious number ` @xmath1 ' by taking it to stand for an @xmath1-element set : a set of photons .",
    "so perhaps categorification can help us understand the quantized harmonic oscillator more deeply .    to test this notion more carefully ,",
    "the first thing to check is whether we can categorify the inner product on fock space .",
    "in fact we can !",
    "given power series @xmath178 their fock space inner product is given by @xmath179 categorifying , we define the inner product of structure types @xmath115 and @xmath82 as follows : @xmath180 note that the result is a groupoid .",
    "if we take the cardinality of this groupoid , we get back the inner product of the generating functions of @xmath115 and @xmath82 : @xmath181 even better , this groupoid has a nice interpretation : its objects are finite sets equipped with both a structure of type @xmath115 and a structure of type @xmath82 , and its morphisms are bijections preserving both structures .    to go further , we should categorify linear operators on fock space , since in quantum theory observables are described by self - adjoint operators . for this",
    ", we really need the ` stuff types ' mentioned at the end of the previous section , and we need to use a little more category theory .",
    "the inner product on structure types extends naturally to an inner product on stuff types , the inner product of @xmath182 and @xmath183 being a groupoid @xmath184 called their ` weak pullback ' .",
    "we define a _ stuff operator _ to be a groupoid @xmath185 equipped with a functor @xmath186 . stuff operators really work very much like operators on fock space .",
    "we can act on a stuff type @xmath115 by a stuff operator @xmath185 and get a stuff type @xmath187 .",
    "there is a nice way to add stuff operators , there is a nice way to compose stuff operators using weak pullbacks , and any stuff operator @xmath185 has an adjoint @xmath188 with @xmath189 for all stuff types @xmath115 and @xmath82 .",
    "just as any stuff type @xmath115 satisfying a certain finiteness condition has a generating function @xmath190 which is a vector in fock space , any stuff operator @xmath185 satisfying a certain finiteness condition gives an operator on fock space , which we call @xmath191 .",
    "this operator is characterized by the fact that @xmath192 for any stuff type @xmath115 for which @xmath190 lies in fock space . and as one would hope , we have @xmath193 for any stuff operators @xmath185 and @xmath194 .    in physics ,",
    "the most important operators on fock space are the _ annihilation _ and _ creation _ operators , @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "the annihilation operator acts as differentiation on power series : @xmath197 while the creation operator acts as multiplication by @xmath3 : @xmath198 as their names suggest , these operators decrease or increase the number of photons by 1 .",
    "these operators are adjoint to one another , but not inverses .",
    "instead , they satisfy the famous relation @xmath199 while this relation plays a crucial role throughout quantum theory , it remains slightly mysterious : why should first creating a photon and then destroying one give a different result than first destroying one and then creating one ? if categorification is going to help us understand the quantized harmonic oscillator , it must give an explanation of this fact .    to give such an explanation , we must first describe the stuff operator @xmath41 that serves as the categorified version of the annihilation operator .",
    "since @xmath41 actually maps structure types to structure types , instead of giving its full definition we shall take the more intuitive course of saying how it acts on structure types .",
    "given a structure type @xmath115 , a structure of type @xmath200 on the finite set @xmath29 is defined to be a structure of type @xmath115 on @xmath201 , where @xmath62 is the 1-element set .",
    "note that @xmath202 or in short : @xmath203    next let us describe a categorified version of the creation operator .",
    "we could simply define @xmath204 to be the adjoint of @xmath41 , but @xmath204 actually maps structure types to structure types , so let us say how it does so . for any structure type @xmath115 , a structure of type @xmath205 on @xmath29 consists of a choice of element @xmath31 together with a structure of type @xmath115 on @xmath206 .",
    "this is the same thing as chopping @xmath29 into two disjoint parts and putting the structure of ` being a 1-element set ' on one part and a structure of type @xmath115 on the other , so @xmath207 and thus @xmath208    next we we should check that our annihilation and creation operators satisfy a categorified version of the commutation relations @xmath209 . of",
    "course we wish to avoid minus signs , and having categorified we should speak of natural isomorphism rather than equality , so we write this as @xmath210 we will not give a rigorous proof of this here ; instead , we will we just sketch the proof that @xmath211 when @xmath115 is is a structure type . to put a structure of type @xmath212 on a finite set @xmath29",
    "is to put a structure of type @xmath213 on the set @xmath201 .",
    "this , in turn , is the same as choosing an element @xmath214 and putting a structure of type @xmath115 on @xmath215 .",
    "now either @xmath31 or @xmath216 . in the first case we are really just choosing an element @xmath217 and putting a structure of type @xmath200 on @xmath206 .",
    "this is the same as putting a structure of type @xmath218 on @xmath29 .",
    "in the second case we are really just putting a structure of type @xmath115 on @xmath29 .",
    "we thus have @xmath219 as desired .",
    "the interesting thing about this calculation is that it is purely combinatorial .",
    "it reduces a fact about quantum theory to a fact about finite sets .",
    "if we examine it carefully , it boils down to this : if we have a box with some balls in it , there is one more way to put an extra ball in and then take a ball out than there is to take a ball out and then put one in !",
    "starting from here one can march ahead , categorifying huge tracts of quantum physics , all the way to the theory of feynman diagrams .",
    "for now we content ourselves here with the briefest sketch of how this would go , leaving the details for later @xcite .",
    "first , we define the _ field operator _ to be the stuff operator @xmath220 our normalization here differs from the usual one in physics because we wish to avoid dividing by @xmath221 , but all the usual physics formulas can be adapted to this new normalization . more generally , we define the _ wick powers _ of @xmath222 , denoted @xmath223 , to be the stuff operators obtained by taking @xmath224 , expanding it in terms of the annihilation and creation operators , and moving all the annihilation operators to the right of all the creation operators ` by hand ' , ignoring the fact that they do not commute .",
    "for example : @xmath225 and so on .    in quantum field theory one",
    "spends a lot of time doing calculations with products of wick powers . in the categorified context , these are stuff operators of the form @xmath226 what is such a stuff operator like ? in general , it does _ not _ map structure types to structure types , so we really need to think of it as a groupoid @xmath185 equipped with a functor @xmath227 .",
    "an object of @xmath185 is a _ feynman diagram _ : a graph with @xmath228 vertices of valence @xmath229 respectively , together with univalent vertices labelled by the elements of two finite sets , say @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we draw feynman diagrams like this :      we draw the vertices labelled by elements of @xmath29 on the top and think of them as ` outgoing ' particles . we draw the vertices labelled by elements of @xmath30 on bottom , and think of them as ` incoming ' particles .",
    "we can think of the feynman diagram as the pair of sets @xmath230 equipped with extra ` stuff ' , namely the body of the diagram .",
    "the functor @xmath186 sends the feynman diagram to the pair @xmath230 .    while feynman diagrams began as a kind of bookkeeping device for quantum field theory calculations involving wick powers , they have increasingly taken on a life of their own .",
    "here we see that they arise naturally from the theory of finite sets equipped with extra structure , or more generally , extra ` stuff ' .",
    "since categorification eliminates problems with divergent power series ( as we have already seen in the previous section ) , it is tempting to hope that this viewpoint will help us understand the divergences that have always plagued the theory of feynman diagrams .",
    "of course this may or may not happen  it is difficult to predict , especially when it comes to the future ."
